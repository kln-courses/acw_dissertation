<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAVAGE LOVING: Beckett, Browning and The Tempest Sophie Ratcliffe This paper considers allusion, parody and ethics in Beckett's work. Bearing in mind Genette's thoughts on the tenderness of parody, it considers Beckett's allu sions to The Tempest and explores the difficulty in determining his sympathies towards other writers, readers, and fictional creatures. This difficulty is partly due to his tonal indeterminacy and reluctance to own allusive sources. I argue that this indeterminacy about sources and origins is in itself parodic - recalling Prospero's difficult acknowledgment of Caliban. The article proceeds to uncover allusions to Browning's "Caliban upon Setebos" in How It Is, suggesting that Beckett's mock ery of sympathetic identification works through parodic (and therefore tender) acts of textual allusion. Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster! (The Tempest II. ii. 83) Samuel Taylor Coleridge had endless admiration for the compassionate nature of Shakespeare's women. Everyone wishes them "for a wife", he admits, "creatures who, though they may not always understand you, do always feel you, and feel with you" (Coleridge, 131). Beckett's long engage ment with one of the most famously feeling characters in fiction was rather more precarious. William Hutchings (Hutchings, 11) writes that his "earliest allusion" to The Tempest occurs in Waiting for Godot, when Lucky thinks highly of Miranda: Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged into torment [...]. (Beckett 1986, 42) 147</page><page sequence="2">In fact, he wrote of giving "Mumps and an orchid to Fraulein Miranda" some twenty-one years earlier, in his 1931 poem "Return to the Vestry" (Harvey 1970, 311). Such sterile gifts show little promise for a fruitful rela tionship, but Beckett was enchanted, in spite of himself, by Shakespeare's heroine. His lingering aversions and attractions show themselves in the way in which her play allusively inhabits a number of his other texts, indicating something about the complex nature of parody in his work. Katherine Worth is one of a number of critics that have dwelt on Beckett's allusions to The Tempest. She comments that "Miranda's cap acity to feel so keenly the sufferings of strangers, seems to place her in another dimension than that inhabited by the unpitied carrier". In this way, The Tempest "sends out [...] echoes into Beckett's world through the name Miranda, she who was able to suffer 'with those that I saw suffer'; the authentic Beckettian note" (Worth 127,11). Miranda briefly reappears as a point of comparison in Beckett's Proust, where the narrator recalls his grandmother's illness and "unlike Miranda [...] suffers with her whom he had not seen suffer" (Beckett 1965, 45). She also gains a cameo role as a nurse in More Pricks Than Kicks's "Yellow" bandaging Belacqua's toe. Worth is, perhaps, too easily moved by Beckett's returns to Miranda's keen feelings. Her admiration informs her assurance that Beckett "did care", that he "touches the springs of our sympathy" and shows us "the high road to human feeling", "Yellow", after all, is a story which appears to parody our notions of suffering, sympathy and "human feeling". Parody is a pecu liarly teasing form, though-it seems to resist what it simultaneously acknowledges. As Gerard Gennette notes "it is properly the irreducible ambiguity of teasing, in which mockery is a way of loving and irony (understand who must) only a byway of tenderness" (Genette, 120). Beckett's art has often been held up for ethical scrutiny. Stephen Rosen was "[s]educed and disturbed by the attitudes of Beckett's characters" and "wondered about the mentality that motivated their creation" while less sym pathetic critics who have simply attacked "the seamier side of Mr. Beckett's nasty unconscious" (Rosen, 5; Walker, 533). The philosopher, Martha Nussbaum has found herself struggling with the ethical and emotional res onance of his work. She opens her essay "Narrative Emotions: Beckett's Genealogy of Love" with a passage from near the end of The Unnamable: They love each other, marry, in order to love each other better, more con veniently, he goes to the wars, he dies at the wars, she weeps, with emo tion, at having loved him, at having lost him, yep, marries again, in order to love again, more conveniently again, they love each other, you love as 148</page><page sequence="3">many times as necessary, as necessary in order to be happy, he comes back, the other comes back, from the wars, he didn't die in the wars after all, she goes to the station, to meet him, he dies in the train, of emotion, at the thought of seeing her again, having her again, she weeps, weeps again, with emotion again, at having lost him again, yep, goes back to the house, he's dead, the other is dead, the mother-in-law takes him down, he hanged himself, with emotion, at the thought of losing her, she weeps, weeps louder, at having loved him, at having lost him, there's a story for you, that was to teach me the nature of emotion, that's called emotion, what emotion can do, given favourable conditions, what love can do, well well... that's love. (Beckett 1994,410) Nussbaum sees this voice as both damaged, and damaging. Stories "contain and teach forms of feeling, forms of life" and Beckett "invite[s] us to con sider critically these contingent structures and the narratives that are their vehicle". His world conveys the sense that "emotions are not feelings that well up in some natural and untutored way from our natural selves, that they are, in fact, not personal or natural at all, that they are, instead, contrivances, social constructs" (Nussbaum, 287). Simon Critchley engages with Nussbaum's critique commenting that Beckett is working "not towards an elimination of the emotions, but rather towards a less communally authorised and ritu alised sense of pathos, that of the self in its separation from the other and its ever-failing desire for union, for love" (Critchley, 201). However, in this lyrical argument, styling a wistfully romantic Beckett, Critchley himself falls into that "ritualised sense of pathos" which Beckett resists. Both Critchley and Nussbaum would be helped by noting that the "story for you" is a highly allusive one, parodying that "admirable histoire de revenant". Balzac's Le Colonel Chabert (Morand, 89). "De fortes emotions attendent celui qui tient ce livre entre ses mains." Stephane Vachon writes of this painful narrative in which the elderly Colonel, left for dead in the Napoleonic Wars, returns to Paris to find his wife remarried (5). Beckett's story, then, could be seen not as a "criticism of emotion" (Nussbaum, 293) but as a criticism of "forms of feeling", a parody of the ways in which texts may incite formulaic, complacent emotional reactions in their readers. A salvage and deformed slave The intention behind such parodic allusion is, of course, hard to confirm. But while considerations about "writerly empathy [...] can often only be tentative, they are not irrelevant" (Bryden, 5). My article argues that a tentative feeling for Beckett's parodic allusions - in fact a feeling for the 149</page><page sequence="4">way in which he uses parody tentatively in order to own up to, and stand back from, sympathetic attitudes - may shed light on the ethical under standing of his work. Perhaps his clearest engagement with this owning and disowning of others' voices is seen in Beckett's relations with The Tempest's "salvage and deformed slave" Caliban.3 Retributive, symbiotic relations between creator and creature, reminiscent of Prospero's owning of "this thing of darkness" (The Tempest V v. 302), recur in Beckett's writings. Some have noted echoes in Waiting for Godot, others in the verbal entanglements of Endgame and The Unnamable (Wright, 27; Northam, 186-202). It is in How It Is, I think, that Beckett's struggle with concepts of verbal ownership and dispossession is given its fullest inarticulation. Describing the work in progress to Donald McWhinnie, Beckett emphasised that the theme of the work would be the difficult rela tions between a creator and his "creature known as Pirn", in a manner which echoes, distantly, the relation between Prospero and Caliban: A "man" lying panting in the mud and dark, murmuring his "life" as he hears it obscurely uttered by a voice inside him. This utterance is described throughout the work as the fragmentary recollection of an extraneous voice once heard "quaqua on all sides". In the last pages he is obliged to take the onus of it on himself and of the lamentable tale of the thing it tells. (Knowlson 1997, 461-2) This resistance to authorial obligation begins in the first four words "how it was I quote before Pirn with Pirn after Pirn how it is three parts I say it as I hear it" (Beckett 1996,7). It is hard to gauge how a reader should inflect this text with regard to these vestigial inverted commas. Should the rest of the text be read as if between speech marks? If so, should another vocal shift take place at every "I quote" within the text (there are four more instances in the first twenty-nine strophes) attempting an infinite regress of reported speech? Or are the "I quote" 's merely signposts, reminding the audience that the voice is speaking the words of another? H. Porter Abbott comments that the opening of How It Is, like the last words of Texts for Nothing - "all said, it said, it murmurs" - is suggestive of "a quotational hall of mirrors": "by 'quoting' - that is by implying that the voice that transmits the text is somehow separate from the voice that originates it - these opening lines connect directly with a central theme of the Trilogy and Texts for Nothing: the bewildering multiplicity of the speaking subject" (Abbott, 112). Such tonal uncertainties have been seen as evidence that Beckett was working towards a textual world made up of untethered utterances; in 150</page><page sequence="5">Blanchot's terms, "stories [...] built on a void" (Uhlmann, 140). These readings of Beckett's problematic "condition of iterability" (Connor, 205) stem from the belief that he works within a Derridean tradition where "every sign [...] can be [...] put between quotation marks" indicating "the possi bility of its functioning being cut off, at a certain point, from its 'original' meaning and from its belonging to a saturable and constraining context" (Derrida 1977, 172). This image of Beckett's "denunciation of presence and logocentricity" (Connor, 121) has been supported by Derrida's recent thoughts on their affiliation: "This is an author to whom I feel very close or to whom I would like to feel myself very close" (Derrida, 60). Derrida's hesitation about the possibility of feeling close to another is characteristic of his philosophy's placing of disinterested play over contextualised attach ments. The poststructuralist take on the "multiplicity of the speaking sub ject" in Beckett's work, in which "sources and recipients of speech are not distinguishable" (Sage, 94) means that it is hard to determine a tone of voice in his text, parodic or otherwise. However, there is something particular to the Beckettian action of "quot ing" that distances him from the Derridean school. In a general criticism of Derrida's theories, Eric Griffiths (54) argues that the philosopher has an inadequate definition of "intentionality", grounded on a belief that the author ial intention lurks, in some mysterious way, behind the work. He argues that textual intention lies rather between utterances, in the tones of voices in which we catch or miss each other's meanings. He adds that "the features of context dependency and intention within a context which Derrida believes citation destroys, provide the criteria which distinguish a citation from a repe tition". In How It Is, then, one might argue that the words "I quote" speak to the reader. They reveal something of the voice's illocutionary concerns, to disown the voice of which, and with which, it speaks. For, to "quote" is not, as Abbott claims, the same as "to say it as one hears it" (Abbott, 112). It suggests a particular tone of voice. Inverted commas are visual separations, but they may indicate "some kind of doubt [...] over the 'truthfulness' [...] or [...] 'validity' of a word or phrase" (Lennard, 67). And in this sense, they might lead one to doubt the deviser as much as the material. As Geoffrey Hill writes in his essay "Poetry as 'Menace' and 'Atonement'", punctuation may seem at once "assertive and non-committal. The quotation-marks around 'menace' and 'atonement' look a bit like raised eyebrows" around this "conflation of [...] cliche". Hill goes on to admit that "[b]ehind the fagade" is the "attraction of terminology itself, a power at once supportive and coercive" (Hill, 6). How It Is attempts to resist, through the words "I quote", possessing the "thing it tells". But the "quote" in 151</page><page sequence="6">Beckett indicates, not a clear separation between the voice that speaks and the voice it speaks of, nor a spiral of fictional groundlessness, but some thing between the two. It marks the delicate parodic passage from one voice to another, the passage of sympathy, and of judgment. Browning Aversions It is through such an act of quotation in How It Is that Beckett reveals his particular associations with a writer who, like him, continually dwells on his attachments to, and detachment from, the words of others: Robert Browning. The fourth strophe's "in me that were without when the panting stops scraps of an ancient voice in me not mine" (Beckett 1996, 7) recalls Browning's 1842 "Advertisment" to his Dramatic Lyrics: Such Poems as the majority in this volume might also come properly enough, I suppose, under the head of "Dramatic Pieces"; being, though often Lyric in expression, always Dramatic in principle, and so many utter ances of so many imaginary persons, not mine - R. B. (Browning, 347) The echo of this tetchy disclaimer is light, admittedly - and James Knowlson has rightly warned against "unduly explicit" and "over-referential" readings of Beckett's allusions (Knowlson, 18). However, the allusions to Browning in Beckett's work deserve explication precisely because they shed light on the tonal manner in which the quotational snatches from "without" should be read, or whether any tone can be heard at all. Like Browning, Beckett was concerned to keep his distance from his quoted words. In answer to Knowlson's inquiry about Happy Days, he wrote: I simply know next to nothing about my work in this way, as little as a plumber of the history of hydraulics. There is nothing/nobody with me when I am writing, only the hellish job in hand. The "eye of the mind" in Happy Days does not refer to Yeats any more than the "revels" in Endgame to The Tempest. They are just bits of pipe I happen to have with me. I suppose it's all reminiscence from womb to tomb. All I can say is I have scant information concerning mine - alas. (Knowlson 1983, 16) He showed the same lack of intimacy with his sources in regard to what he refers to as the "hint of Browning" in Happy Days (Beckett 1985, 99). When Alan Schneider asked for the references to Winnie's misquotations, including the line "Ever uppermost - like Browning", Beckett wrote that 152</page><page sequence="7">"No one will get this reference, tant pis. It is to a line of Browning - 'I'll say confusedly what comes uppermost'". He adds: "The revolver is called 'Browning - Brownie' not because there is a weapon of that name - but because it is always uppermost. If the line was by another poet the revolver wd. be called by the name of that other poet" (Harmon, 13). It is, however, hard to credit this dismissal of the importance of the "hint". The way in which Beckett both wishes for his readers to "get" the reference, while simultaneously holding it at arm's length, shows his affinities with that Victorian poet of dramatic monologue who was so concerned to claim his utterances "not mine". Generically speaking, the dramatic monologue is central to the ethical difficulties of the ways in which we deal with our voices, and those of others. Robert Langbaum was one of the first to note the way in which a poem like "My Last Duchess" creates a "tension between sympathy and judgment" for both the reader and the writer (Langbaum, 85). Ralph Rader argues that it asks for an "imaginative act of conflation and compassion by which [...] we understand other people. We become them (sympathy) while remaining ourselves (judgment)". Surprisingly though, Rader claims that this "double response is not a matter of ethical or psychological ambiguity" (Rader, 133). Perhaps he overestimates the ease with which we "understand other people". How It Is and Caliban When Hugh Kenner mentions that How It Is "contains no ingredient (unless perhaps mud) which we have not encountered before" he is forget ting its piscine flavour (Kenner, 199). There is something fishy about the text, as the speaker imagines: sea beneath the moon harbour-mouth after the sun the moon always light day and night little heap in the stem it's me all those I see are me all ages the current carries me out the awaited ebb I'm looking for an isle home at last drop never move again a little turn at evening to the sea-shore sea wards then back drop sleep wake in the silence eyes that dare open stay open live old dream on crabs kelp (Beckett 1996, 94) There is also a touch of The Tempest about the slapstick-style intimacies in "PART II". The finding "Pirn's right buttock then first contact" and ensuing logistical difficulties - "cries tell me which end the head" (Beckett 1996, 59, 60) - might bring to mind the Trinculo-cum-Caliban pairing which Stephano feels for: "misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows", as 153</page><page sequence="8">Trinculo puts it as he climbs under the gabardine (The Tempest II. ii. 40-1). The most distinctive "ancient voice" within the text, though, is the creature with "the ancient and fish-like smell" (The Tempest II. ii. 24-6) Caliban. Times have changed, however. Though he is related to Shakespeare's creation, Beckett's mud-crawling connoisseur of tinned sardines and canned cod's liver has gone through some sort of evolutionary process. The missing link is Browning's 1864 poem "Caliban upon Setebos; or, Natural Theology in the Island". "Caliban upon Setebos" bears a family resemblance to Beckett's text. It is of the same species-like the quote-ridden How It Is, a sort of double dramatic monologue. Browning's Caliban repeatedly speaks in the third person, in "a curious attempt to mislead his hearer" (Brown, 393). And a fear of Setebos, at the close of the poem, prompts Caliban in an almost Beckettian idiom - to disown all he has said as "fool's play, this prattling". The original scene, for Browning, finds a disgruntled Caliban lugging wood, and cursing his master's powers, and the poem consists of his speculation about his origins, and the existence of Setebos, the god worshipped by his "dam" as he sprawls: "Flat on his belly in the pit's much mire,/With elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his chin (11. 2-3). Critics cannot make up their mind quite whether Browning's Caliban demands our compassion or our contempt. Pettigrew argues that the poem was inspired by the theologian, Theodore Parker, whose tract on "A Bumblebee's Thoughts on the Plan and purpose of the Universe" aimed to expose the weaknesses of works of natural theology like The Bridgewater Treatises. Caliban's own attempts to construe metaphysical truth from his natural environment seem to demonstrate Parker's warning thesis that "a man rude in spirit must have a rude conception of God" (Browning, 1158). Michael Howard (254), however, argues that "Caliban upon Setebos" is not so much a satire on nineteenth century anthropomorphic tendencies as a "poem of sympathy" for his "struggle for knowledge by his own limited [...] sensibility". He proposes that Caliban's ability "to see only parallel relationships" reflects Browning's feelings for man's own defective under standing of God. The "monster of solitude" of How It Is shares much with Browning's Caliban. There are explicit verbal echoes. His physical position recalls his Victorian counterpart as he describes himself as "flat on my belly in the mud", "in the warm mire" and "in a daze on my belly" (Beckett 1996,159, 43, 47). He is, like Caliban, monstrous, but sensitive to his predicament, especially in his close observation of the natural world. Caliban's delicate habit of plucking the legs off grubs ("I might hear his cry, / And give the mankin three sound legs for one, / Or pluck the other off, leave him like an 154</page><page sequence="9">egg" (11. 91-4) is picked up in the lepidopterous torture of How It Is "I scis sored into slender strips the wings of butterflies first one wing then the other sometimes for a change two abreast" (Beckett 1996, 10). Crucially, what the two characters share is an urge for metaphysical speculation, somewhat hampered by their unusually restricted, recumbent view of the world. Browning's Caliban survives by the making of "new worlds" (1. 245) to understand his own predicament, lording it over "his Ariel a tall pouch-bill crane" and reasoning that if he himself "Taketh his mirth with make-believes: so He" (11. 161, 169). It is such a view that inspires a type of ontological angst on the part of both creatures - the sense that although there may be some other world, they are unable to see it. This ontological confusion is echoed by the reader's knowledge of the intertex tual nature of each poem - as each of these creatures is unaware that they have been authored by a previous fiction. Whether each text is parodying or sympathising with its protagonist, both centres around the notion of frus trated understanding and distance given in Browning's epigraph: "Thou thoughtest I was such a one as thyself." Divine quickening: connecting through punctuation The parallel between the artist and the God is heightened by Browning's use of poetic apparatus. Browning was "consistently interested in the typog raphy of fictional transcription", using spacing and punctuation "to combine the subtlest graphic exploitations with the clearest functional uses" (Lennard, 147). One of these functional uses, for Browning, was the way in which punctuation could be used to poke fun at his poetic creation, flattening its tones of voice by drawing attention to its printed medium. Beckett has inherited this interest-critics cannot but mention the apparent absence of those elocutionary, signalling pauses that usually aid one's sense of a vocal intonation in a text, thus bringing How It Is "perilously close to the unread able" (Alvarez, 189). Such a lack of tonal instruction could be seen, in part, as a demonstration of the text's "openness". You can say it as you hear it. Wright (13) notes that "in a key-text for the development of the anti-authorial polemic, "What is an Author?" [Foucault] cites the opening of the third section of Textespour rien - "Qu'importe qui parle, quelqu'un a dit qu'import qui parle" / "What matter who is speaking, someone said what matter who is speaking" - as the very embodiment of "one of the fundamental ethical principles of contemporary writing". The "ethical principle" in mind here, is the Bartheian image of the death of the work tyrannically centred on the author and its replacement with a freeplay of signifiers. There is a question as to how one is to react emotionally to a narrative in which there 155</page><page sequence="10">is, literally, no mark of punctuation except the apparently arbitrary blank - is there literally "no point"? For punctuation "is to the written word as car tilage is to bone, permitting articulation and bearing the stress of movement [...] in poetry it may be the opportunity to delicately shade a meaning" (Lennard, 58). However, as Christopher Ricks notes, citing Eliot (Ricks, 342), punctuation "includes the absence of punctuation marks, when they are omitted where the reader would expect them". There are moments, in the text, of pointed poignancy about this lack of shading: the blue there was then the white dust impressions of more recent date pleasant unpleasant and those finally unruffled by emotion things not easy unbroken no paragraphs no commas not a second for reflection with the nail of the index until it falls and the worn back bleeding passim it was near the end like yesterday vast stretch of time (Beckett 1996, 78) The proximity of "unruffled by emotion" and "unbroken no paragraphs" here, suggests the way in which the text on Pirn's "worn back" might pro vide an insight into the ethical ambiguity of textual pointings. A text with "no paragraphs no commas not a second for reflection" seems callous, sug gestive of a lack of feeling for both Beckett's and Pirn's audience. But Pirn is, perhaps, not as "unbroken" as he thinks. At the beginning of Part III, he looks back with, it seems, a degree of nostalgia: "before Pirn long before with Pirn vast tracts of time kinds of thoughts same family divers doubts emotions too yes emotions some with tears yes tears motions too and move ments" (Beckett 1996, 111). However, the "tract" of How It Is keeps slip ping, comically, over modes of feeling, even while it resists them. Take the moment when the sack falls apart: "no emotion all is lost the bottom burst the wet the dragging the rubbing the hugging" (Beckett 1996, 51). The voice, here, hints that there is "no emotion", for "all is lost", but in the very cadence of the phrase "all is lost" it summons up the emotion that is denied, recalling tones from "Lines on Hearing that Lady Byron was 111" It is not in the storm nor in the strife We feel benumb'd, and wish no more, But in the after-silence on the shore When all is lost, except a little life. (Byron 1970, 94) 156</page><page sequence="11">The text, in spite of itself, loses hold of, and finds, its own blackly comic tones of voice or emotions sensations take a sudden interest in them and even then what the fuck I quote does it matter who suffers faint waver here faint tremor" (Beckett 1996, 144). There is a question here, though no question mark, for "does it matter who suffers" in this text? Is there anything to parody, or any voice with which to take such a posture? Beckett's placing of "I quote", here, is a partial answer. It attempts to per form a tonal difference - as if the voice were attempting to perform sud den embarrassed distancing from "what the fuck". Simultaneously, the words "I quote" resists giving this embarrassment full voice, recalling the reader to the "problematic iterability" of this text which flattens such, or any, tones. Looking before and after Pim: what How It Is asks of the reader Perhaps the feature of punctuation that How It Is misses most is the question mark. While Browning's Caliban plays at Hamlet, bemoaning his discomfort - "But wherefore rough, why cold and ill at ease? / Aha, that is a question!" (11. 127-8) - Beckett's speaker thinks back on the reason of that noble mind, struggling to see a shape to his life. As the Dane puts it: Sure he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unus'd. (Hamlet IV iv. 36-9) Initially, though, How It Is seems to resist, and remake Hamlet's query. The prepositional assurance of "before Pim with Pim after Pim" suggests that the speaker can see both ends of his narrative. As the text continues, it holds out against open-ended discourse: part one before Pim how I got here no question not known not said and the sack whence the sack and me if it's me no question impossible too weak no importance life life the other above in the light said to have been mine on and off no going back up there no question no one asking that of me (Beckett 1996, 8) 157</page><page sequence="12">The violent possibilities of Beckett's punctuation come into full force in Part II, as the text beseeches its absent question mark: silence more and more longer and longer silences vast tracts of time we at a loss more and more he for answers I for questions sick of life in the light one question how often no more figures no more time vast figure vast stretch of time on his life in the dark the mud before me mainly curiosity was he still alive YOUR LIFE HERE BEFORE ME (Beckett 1996, 81) Being, as it is, "at a loss for questions", the capitalised engraving that is scraped onto Pirn's back terrifies. With the intonation restored, it might refer to the nature of his life before the torture began. However, in its unpunc tuated state, "YOUR LIFE HERE BEFORE ME" could be seen to enclose a textual death threat. The horror, and the fear of the end, cry out in the next scrap: "God on God desperation utter confusion did he believe he believed then not couldn't any more his reasons both cases my God" (Beckett 1996, 81). The phrases here, echo back to the voice of Christ in St. Mark's gospel, abandoned in his questioning - "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Mark 15: 34). Though, at times, there is a touch of nonchalance about the speaker's contact with Pirn - "purely curiosity was he still alive thump thump in the mud vile tears of unbutcherable brother" - there is also a Godforsaken desperation for response as the "question old question if yes or no" (Beckett 1996, 82, 44) accumulates at the text's end: only me yes alone yes with my voice yes my murmur yes when the pant ing stops yes all that holds yes panting yes worse and worse no answer WORSE AND WORSE yes flat on my belly yes in the mud yes the dark yes nothing to emend there no the arms spread like a cross no answer LIKE A CROSS no answer YES OR NO yes (Beckett 1996, 159) Questions are also important to this text because its title is, in part, an answer. Like "Caliban upon Setebos", How It Is is attempting a type of explanation, it "serves to remove or avert a misunderstanding" (Wittgenstein, 41). Both texts make an appeal to the possibility of comprehension. The speakers aspire to comprehend their predicament, to see "before and after". Wayne Booth notes that the title How It Is "trumpet[s] such claims" for a godlike breadth of vision, a claim strengthened by the pun on "beginning" in the French title, Comment c est (1988, 344). 158</page><page sequence="13">In his excellent book Beckett and Poststructuralism Anthony Uhlmann describes the way in which one might "overthrow a system of judgement" when considering ethics in Beckett's work. He quotes Deleuze's Spinoza: Practical Philosophy. "All one needs in order to moralize is to fail to understand" (Uhlmann, 107). Such links between judging and understanding become grammatically and allusively alive in Beckett's texts, as the reader is presented with a barrier to conventional modes of "understanding" a narrative. But there is, Uhlmann notes, some alternative. In A Thousand Plateaus (1989), Deleuze and Guattari propose a way of relating "ethics" to "ethology", of considering an ethical approach which takes account of a body's particularity, its "haecceity [...] the assemblage that is defined by longitude and latitude, by speeds and affects" (Uhlmann, 123). In the case of How It Is, this would mean an understanding of the text's affectlessness, and an attempt, perhaps, at a different way of reading. "Understanding", as Stanley Fish writes, "is more than linear processing" (Fish, 143). It seems that the inherent instability and difficulty of Beckett's parodies comes from the elusive double-voiced quality of his allusive technique. As Harold Bloom notes, the difficulty of Beckett's Endgame is that every allu sion appears to be "endstopped" (Bloom 1988, 8). But perhaps this appar ent endstopping is itself parodic - recalling the difficult process of acknowledgement in The Tempest. In the end, Beckett's new worlds mock sympathetic tenderness and identification through parodic (and therefore necessarily tender) acts of textual allusion. Such tonal ambiguity places the onus of understanding upon the reader. Notes 1. I use the text edited by Frank Kermode (London: Routledge, 1964). All ref erences in the main text are to this edition. 2. See Ruby Conn's "Tempest in an Endgame", in Symposium xix (1965), 328-34, and her Modern Shakespeare Offshoots (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1976); Hutchings (1993) and Northam (1997) also discuss Beckett and The Tempest. Georges Belmont recalls reading the play aloud with Beckett in Paris, in an attempt to learn English. It seems that Beckett wasn't willing to play Miranda. "I was a bit vexed", Belmont adds "because he had taken all the masculine parts and left me all the feminine ones!"; see also Georges Belmont and John Calder, "Remembering Sam", in Beckett in Dublin, ed. S. E. Wilmer (Dublin: Lilliput P, 1992), 111-29, 111. 159</page><page sequence="14">3. Caliban is described as a "salvage" and deformed "slave" in the Folio's "Names of Actors". The meaning of 'salvage' here, Kermode notes, is restricted; it is a variant of savage, indicating the primitive nature that Prospero and Miranda despise. However, there is a sense in which Caliban could be seen as fictional 'salvage' - picked up, and given a "life of afterlife" by authors from Dryden to Auden. 4.
