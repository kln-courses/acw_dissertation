<plain_text><page sequence="1">Donald Crosby's Religion of Nature: Some Second Thoughts Robert B. Tapp / University of Minnesota Critiquing Crosby has been a special pleasure since I have been discovering so many parallels in our trajectories. We both grew up near oceans, both hiked a lot in high mountains, both loved mallard ducks (I had 21 in my backyard until my mother finally objected to them coming into her kitchen). More significantly, we are both post-traditionals, having left our childhood Christianities. Albert Schweitzer impacted both of us on the religious side; while Peirce, James, Whitehead, and Dewey have shaped our philosophic sides. And we are both fortunate to be living in marriages with good editors! Since we are both comfortable being termed atheists or nontheists (at least if the labeler is not carrying a shotgun), it might seem that what I have written is merely semantic quibbling. His earlier critique of nihilism makes clear that a world without gods is by no means an empty or meaningless world. This new book marks an important stage in his intellectual Odyssey?the move from naturalism to an actual religion of nature. This is therefore a brave book, especially in these times. When I was a graduate student in the 40s, the President of Union Theological Seminary wrote an article for The Christian Century titled "Invisible Religion." Would you believe that he was describing fundamentalist Protestants! In 1970 a book entitled The Late Great Planet Earth was published and scholars who noted it at all dismissed it as a very deviant pre-milllennialist tract.1 (In those days, "Christian book" sales were not counted.) Now the LaHaye-Jenkins series is drawing to a close, and a wider public, via media information, associates Christianity with very different meanings than was once the case.2 This triumph of imminent eschatology obviously plays a central role in today's White House. In this climate, Crosby's wisdom will have a struggle to be heard, and it is 1 Lindsey, Hal, and Carole C. Carlson, The Late Great Planet Earth (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1970). 2 LaHaye, Tim F., and Jerry B.

Crosby starts with his view of "nature" as "the whole system of things and relations" that is "metaphysically ultimate" and "lacking in purpose, sentience, or consciousness." He proceeds from this high-level characterization to some qualifyings?distinguishing between "experiencing" and "conceptualizing." This moves him into a Deweyan instrumentalism and allows him space for the human. Was there "nature" before our human life form evolved? Of course, but not as a concept since there would have been no conceptualizers. Crosby avoids an anthropocentrism here by allowing less complex life forms to possess a limited awareness of their surroundings and adjust their behaviors. Only humans, as far as we know, conceptualize nature also as a "totality." In fact, Crosby stays quite close to the Thomistic distinction between natura naturans and natura naturata. Whereas Christian philosophers have used this distinction to distinguish between a Creator and His created world, Crosby brings both aspects within a monistic naturalism. He considers alternative terminologies (world, cosmos, universe) but in the end stays with "nature" for his all-encompassing category. The problem with any of these is how to avoid staying limited by ordinary language. Each can mean "all that has been, is, could be" whereas in ordinary usage each refers to that which "is." This becomes more complicated when one accepts evolutionary changes. Crosby discusses solutions giving priority to pattern and others to process in regard to nature. His ultimate choice is to give priority to process?even being open to Whitehead's suggestion of the possibility of multiple successive universes. A reader must be careful here not to pick out individual sentences. Crosby's style is to list possible solutions to an argument, work through each one, then work through arguments against, and finally to give his own position. After all the issues of universes(s) have been explored, for instance, he finally points to "growth, nurture, productivity, and change" (42).3 But then he backs off from finding a progressive pattern, insisting that what we have is "world-making and world-unmaking." 3 Donald A.

Crosby then turns to the sciences as giving us more detailed accounts. Some of the current sciences have become so complex, even speculative, that non practitioners have difficulty gaining any real understanding. Crosby's notes show that he has worked hard at this throughout his long teaching career. For me it is convenient to distinguish among macro-worlds and micro-worlds of astronomy, cosmology, and physics and a mid-world of ordinary human experiences and conceptualizations. It is within that mid-world where Crosby centers his attention. The micro- and macro-worlds of strings and quarks and quantum gravity and black holes hold few examples for him, and he is not deeply troubled by their "strangeness" in terms of common sense experiences. He ends up saying that we must not "exaggerate or misinterpret the objectivity of the natural sciences." In fact he sees an "irreducible pluralism" in these sciences (47). Rather than positing a continuum of objectivity in the sciences?from physics through biology to psychology, hard to soft?Crosby holds out for different "types" of objectivity. Another way of approaching this is by insisting that humans are a part of nature, not separate from it; and therefore that their experiences are an inevitable part of their "knowledge" about matters. We experience a planet quite differently than we experience a suicide bomber. Both, of course, are parts of "nature," but a different range of memories and judgments enters into assessment of the bomber than would be necessary for an astronomer studying the planet. Crosby, the philosopher, is here reminding the sciences of their metaphysical foundations?however unnecessary such recognitions may be for the actual doing of scientific investigation. For the fullest description here, he turns to the phrase "lived experience," the awareness that experience is as "bodily" as it is "mental." Throughout the book Crosby is at pains to dissociate his argument from that of logical positivists?that sense experience is all, and that matters such as aesthetics and axiology are simply "nonsense" (and that the mathematical language used to describe the findings of the sciences is itself simply tautological and neutral language). Actual human experiences are, for Crosby, far more complex, far more incompletely described in our analyses and formulations.</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 26, No. 3, September 2005 187 Nowhere is this clearer than in the realm of values. For positivists, these were statements in the subjective land of nonsense. Crosby wants to find values in nature itself. Obviously there are values in the human sphere of action, but he wants to find them also in nonhuman nature. His argument begins with a Whiteheadean position that science involves selective abstraction, and that this necessarily omits values. By regarding scientific statements as "inferential," Crosby reminds us of their abstract and arbitrary elements. Despite being subject to change with new discovery, scientific knowledge is "good" for us in practical and even aesthetic ways. Facts and values, in this view, are always interpenetrated. A typical statement: "We can be powerfully stirred with feelings of awe and reverence as we behold a vista of rugged, snow-draped mountains stretching to the horizon." Crosby seems to be claiming that such feelings are not only meaningful for the ordinary person but that they are somehow part of a scientific description. He calls on Whitehead and James here regarding the emergence of "actual entities" as a value, and the notion that a fact puts us in new and desirable relationships with other knowledge. There is a vagueness to statements of value that is often used to lower their status vis-?-vis scientific statements. Crosby reverses this, arguing that the more exact scientific statements are also the more abstract ones, and that even science is engaged in approximation rather than exactitude. If Crosby relies heavily on Peirce regarding the false lure of exactitude, his case for the experience component in the sciences rests on Dewey's view of how knowledge comes to be. Dewey's key idea here is that it is "the context of non-cognitive but experienced subject matter which gives what is known its import" (72). Crosby is fully aware that for Dewey these "feelings" are simply the starting point for experiences and judgments?but they are indeed there and serve as reminders of the place of values in the human acts of knowing. The viewpoint of the book is to defend a relational view of values in nature. Values are neither human constructs nor inherent in nature?they only become evident in the processes of knowing nature. Crosby's summary; "Take self away, and world collapses. Take world away, and self collapses." While this surely is true for any individual thinker, it gets tricky when the onlookers' viewpoint is considered at a funeral.</page><page sequence="5">188 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy This position works well in avoiding any problems of a non worldly self/soul. But how do we continue to maintain that there are nevertheless inherent values in a nature without humans? Crosby asserts that "nonhuman valuers or searchers for value" [including even plants] establish the relational situation. This extreme Kantianism thins out the connotations of value considerably. The ten types of value that he finds inherent in nature are life, species, ecosystems, biosphere, diversity, creativity, splendor, practical, moral, religious. Each is developed at some length throughout the book. Chapter 4 closes with a recognition that certain "disvalues" are also inherent in nature: death, starvation, suffering, pain, disease, waste. Turning to humans, Crosby sees the human body, with all its powers, as an evolutionary product. No dualism here in terms of any human uniqueness. In fact he spends several pages defending "consciousness" in less complex animals, indebted to Frans de Waal and Bernard Rollin. It is at this point that a critique of the dualism and human centeredness of Christian anthropology becomes apparent. With the establishment of the bodily nature of animal and human existence, Crosby is able to develop a human distinctiveness "in degree." The traits he cites are language sophistication, reasoning, purposive freedom, sophisticated culture creation, technological proficiency. The adjectival modifiers here recognize lesser versions of these traits in simpler species of life, and in some sense language is the major factor in each of the other four. Crosby here begins to stake out his ecological position. "Our cultures and their productions and activities should not be threats to the rest of nature's creatures, as they so often have been in the past but our distinctive way of making intelligent, empathetic, ongoing contributions so that they flourish as much as we do" (107). This becomes an even harder task when Crosby sees technology as a natural good and part of human culture?reminding us of the semantic closeness of artifact and artificial, and seeing both as traits to be valued. Human cultures thus are related parts of nature, and in another sense of their relatedness, they are responsible for the larger nature. "The good of one species is the good of all, and the suffering or degradation of one species may well threaten the suffering or degradation of all" (112). Crosby turns to specifically religious language at this point: "We must learn to reverence and hold in awe the sacredness of earth as our beloved community and household"</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 26, No. 3, September 2005 189 (113f.)?and he becomes specific about this different religiosity in Part 3. Although he sees Taoism and Shintoism as being more clearly religions centered on nature, Crosby treats religions here generically? products varying by culture but consistently embodying certain characteristics. Here he draws upon his 1981 Interpretive Theories of Religion where they were designated Uniqueness, Primacy, Pervasiveness, Rightness, Permanence, Hiddenness. Each has a cosmic and a personal side, and these are here developed as related to an encompassing Nature. Crosby characterizes nature as "a blend of stability and change, pattern and process . . . relative permanence and ongoing change" (121). He recognizes that this characterization makes nature a problematic nominee for the center of religious focus. Even if nature qualifies, "How well does it qualify?" Crosby's ways of dealing with objections to his religionizing of nature are, to this reader, the most thoughtful part of the book. First he cites three moral objections?nature's wastefulness, cruelty, and indifference. Then he deals with nature's lack of personality and with its contingency. Finally, he faces the practical issue of how one could treat nature religiously. These first three are clearly linked. Overpopulating is clearly the pattern of most species?overpopulating in terms of food supplies and niche size. But will it really do to say that this excess provides food for other species? Certainly that is the fact. But how damaging is it to any attempt to make nature both primary and worshipful? Will it really do to see profligacy as a means of providing and recycling finite resources? Or to see cruelty as an anthropomorphic category not applicable to nature? Or as wrongly imputing a kind of personal responsibility to a nonpersonal nature? Crosby resorts to a kind of ledger-balancing here. Things do work together for the good of ecosystems, but that functioning is also a source of much pain. Finally, he turns to William James for the concept of "concatenated unity" as a way of saying that the whole picture helps justify bad scenes in individual parts. He then uses the term "radical ambiguity" to describe these issues. This is not improved by citing a number of Yahweh's less-pleasant escapades in the biblical narratives. Worst of all, he introduces the term "mystery" here. This takes us way back to the redactors of the Job story. Of course traditional religions</page><page sequence="7">190 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy have resorted to mystery when theodicy was difficult. But one would expect a modern transformation of religion to do better! As for the charge of indifference, Crosby suggests that the term implies a kind of personality that he does not claim nature to possess. Surely the objection exceeds this. Think of the poet's phrase "I am the grass, I cover all." Since we humans build cultures despite this inevitable equalitarian coverage, Crosby sides with Holmes Rolston III here to argue that the presence of such human ingenuity qualifies any claims of indifference. At this point (144) Crosby admits that "human morality cannot be derived directly from the nonhuman part of nature, although there are suggestions and implications" for its development. Since Crosby has been making Rightness a major part of religion, this seems a devastating admission. How about the more metaphysical objection to making nature into a religion?the concern about the absence of anything "personal?" This is a curious objection since clearly the humans that emerge evolutionarily in nature are persons. It is also a quite Western objection since several of the religions that we humans have developed lack any nonhuman personal dimension. Most Buddhist systems even reduce the "human" to a momentary collocation of parts?destined to disintegrate. Crosby is quite open about the absence of gods and spirits from his understanding of nature. His strongest defense seems to be that truth trumps desirability here, and the evidence is simply lacking. He reminds us of his earlier attempt to develop a "physidicy" that would be at least as adequate as traditional theodicies (that is to say, not very). Note the shift of focus when he says "there is no purpose of nature in a religion of nature, there is purpose in nature" (148). Curiously enough, Crosby suggests that one criticism of his religion of nature is that it is too anthropocentric, too close to a "great chain of being" tradition where humans are just below the gods in the descending order of things. I will be suggesting here that he is in fact much closer to the religious humanism that he wants to avoid. In his nature religion there is, of course, no place for such things as petitionary prayer, and he suggests meditation would be a better practice anyway. Another objection that he rejects is that his nature is contingent. The clear response is "On what?" And for theists who would say, "On God," he asks, "On what is such a god contingent?"</page><page sequence="8">Vol. 26, No. 3, September 2005 191 As to the issue of practicing such a religion of nature, he is pessimistic, noting that "most persons" would not be attracted to it. This seems relevant only if we believe that religions ought to be popular and populous. Quakers have made an impact despite their numbers, as have Unitarians?although historically both of those groups have offered their members some of the practices of more Christian religions. Crosby finally demurs from evangelism on the argument that his skills are better fitted for a classroom. Crosby's final chapter narrows the focus to nature religion as a "source of good." In other words, despite the ambiguities of the whole of nature and the occasional disvalues, yet there is good?and good sufficient to ground a religion. He cites four characteristic of this good, focusing on natura naturans: the extraordinary splendor of our homeland earth; the source of all life; the source of human life and cultures; and the implanting in them "a yearning for the preservation of established goodness and for the attainment of ever-increasing goodness in themselves and the rest of the world" (159). His final list of specific values, ones that are possible and with which we should align ourselves, is altruism, compassion, helpfulness, knowledge, tolerance, benevolence. My guess is that none of the contributors to this journal would differ with this list, and most of us would find these values widely distributed among human cultures and their religions. But they would too often have been pushed aside by their disvalues. Think of knowledge, for instance. How many of our religions have seen this as a danger, a fuel for hubris, a strengthening of the propensities to commit evils. Amid my scores of great classroom memories at a large public university, I shall never forget the spring day when a group of students were dancing on the quad, singing "Jesus wants us to be children." They were affiliated with a group that had purchased a large building facing the oldest campus hall and emblazoned it with a banner "Jesus is Lord of the University of Minnesota." As I was packing to deliver the first version of this paper at Highlands, the post brought a new book, The Closing of the Western Mind : the Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason* The frontispiece has 2 fascinating quotes: 4 Freeman, Charles, The Closing of the Western Mind : The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason, 1st American edition (New York: A.

Knopf, 2003).</page><page sequence="9">192 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Blessed is he who learns how to engage in inquiry, with no impulse to harm his countrymen or to pursue wrongful actions, but perceives the order of immortal and ageless nature, how it is structured (Euripides, fragment from an unnamed play, fifth century B.C.). There is another form of temptation, even more fraught with danger. This is the disease of curiosity. ... It is this which drives us to try and discover the secrets of nature, those secrets which are beyond our understanding, which can avail us nothing and which man should not wish to learn (Augustine, late fourth/early fifth century A.D.). This book, let me now shift from highlighting those sections that had caught my attention, is a very good book, very well written. I felt somewhat less lonely after reading it. And I hope it will convert many of its readers (if that verb is appropriate) so that we naturalists will feel even less lonely. But I am not here just to praise Crosby! There are some places where I must be critical. Let me start with his imputation of "creativity" to nature. This seems much too one-sided a word. Why not simply fecundity? Or innovation? Or fierce restlessness, if one wants to be more poetic. To create is not only to do a new thing, but to produce something of improved value, something to satisfy yet-unsatisfied desires. Remember Hume's riposte that unless we had seen other worlds, we have no knowledge that this one might not have been fashioned by an old and malevolent god or even an apprentice godling. And that was said before fossils were even recognized as fossils! Lyell and Darwin and the journey of the Beagle changed all that. Stanley Weinberg keeps reminding us that the fossil record is one of 99 percent failure (Crosby settles for 98 percent)! This is not creativity by any semantic stretch. Superfluity; wastefulness of finite resources; mindless experimentation. Or Richard Dawkins's brilliant coinage, the blind watchmaker. As George Wald liked to phrase it, Given enough time, the impossible becomes inevitable. But Darwin's sharp eyes moved beyond this piecing together of a biological past. He saw the present in more honest terms than any of his predecessors (and in sharper terms than most of us when we stroll</page><page sequence="10">Vol. 26, No. 3, September 2005 193 through our zoos and parks). In chapter 3 of Origin, he recasts our romanticism: We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.5 Darwin not only adopted Spencer's terminology of struggle, he gave it a very specific and powerful meaning: I should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny.6 Our temptation, on the other hand, is to say "evolution" and infer something like progress as well as a preservation of perceived goods and values. While Crosby qualifies this periodically, I think readers will feel him viewing humans and their civilizations/cultures as a kind of advance. But that fossil record is there to haunt us. Think how many "hopeful monsters" might have viewed their stage as "good." The late Stephen Gould's Wonderful Life: the Burgess Shale and the Nature of History reminds us of what might, indeed, have been.7 More chilling, the periodic extinction caused by asteroid impacts reminds us of what indeed did happen?and thus could easily happen again. Impacts such as this are harder to predict than an assertion that the third law of thermodynamics is hanging over all. 5 Philip Appleman, Darwin: Texts Commentary (New York: Norton, 2001), 108. 6 Ibid. 7 Stephen Jay Gould, Wonderful Life: the Burgess Shale and the Nature of History. (New York: W. W. Norton, 1989).</page><page sequence="11">194 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy In short, what we humans now embody in biological terms is by no means the "whole" of nature or even a very significant part, scientifically speaking. The more comforting picture conjured up by Crosby's nature fades when we factor in those continuing "natural disasters" that have persisted since the emergence of our species?earthquakes, floods, fires, tidal waves, volcanic eruptions and sky-darkenings, erosions, avalanches, climate changes. Darwin ended Origin with a very interesting summation of his new biological science?contrasting it with Newton's more fixed view of science. My quote is from the definitive 6th edition where he had added the word "Creator." I agree with the opinion that this was done to placate Emma Darwin's Unitarian piety. It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity,</page><page sequence="12">Vol. 26, No. 3, September 2005 195 from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.8 That final sentence could grace Crosby's book (I wish that Darwin had started it with "Yet"). There is grandeur in this view of life. Bui we dare not gloss over the uncaring context from which life has emerged and re-emerged?or romanticize Darwin's toughmindedness. Didn't he fear that he would be called "the Devil's disciple"? Since humanity's history is also a part of this nature, the list of disvalues grows. Animal pr?dations, intra- and inter-tribal violences, gender struggles, famines, diseases all predate our record-keeping. Once we began building cities, new disasters emerged as we envied and warred with each other. William T. McNeill wrote a world history in which he used the term "centers of primary disturbance" to describe the ways one group worked its will on another.9 This is a great term of scientific neutrality for our age where we keep using such value-laden terms as hegemony, empire, colonialism, independence and freedom movements, regime change, globalization to describe our inter-group violences. So my major criticism of the book is this less-then-neutral depiction of nature. Crosby denies that it has purpose but then allows for its creativity. I will return to this when I contrast ecology and ecologism, but let's first look at the emergence of human values. Crosby rightly sees these as rooted in prehuman parts of our DNA. But I think that a sharper historicizing and prioritizing of values is called for. As I said before, his six values are indeed found in nature. Altruism is also, it seems now certain, rooted in prehuman nature. And more research may well find other values dating back that far. But when we attend to human life, and more particularly modern human life, we enter a more complex and also more exciting climate. Science, industry, and technology have transformed much of the planet into a place where new possibilities?both for creativity and for destruction?abound. Brain power has replaced muscle power with machine power. Technological communication has created a "global village" via printing, photography, radio, TV, and current digital transmissions. Scientific medicine has reduced disease and lengthened lifespans. 8 Appleman, 174. 9 William Hardy McNeill, A World History, (New York: F. Watts, 1967), vi.</page><page sequence="13">196 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Effective contraception has transformed sexuality. Awareness of its variances has changed mass evaluations/misperceptions of sexuality. Mass education has started to transform workforce and gender relations. All of these have changed the ethical situations. We are now on the verge of making democracy the ethical norm and human rights its corollary. These are essentially new situations?not widespread before the Enlightenment and the revolutions that followed. Ethics now must turn on democracy and human rights. And human rights keep expanding?to children, GLBTs, women, formerly invisible populations. In other words, Crosby's six ethical values are an ancient stratum, and the issues today are sharper. The just-concluded process of writing a charter for the European Union exposed this controversy among just a small section of the human population. The issue was whether to recognize any ethical values in a Christian, or even "Judeo-Christian" past or recognize the actual history of the Christian impact on civilizations ("Judeo-Christian" tradition is a never was). Christianity (the representatives of the Vatican, Italy, Poland) lost. The Guardian's correspondent Ian Black described some of the tensions at the meeting, citing Spanish socialist politician Josep Borrell Fontelles, "Many of our values were forged against the church. When it comes to democracy, human rights and equality, God is only a recent convert."10 That position became the prevailing one at the Brussels session. Supported openly by the French, it was also supported by Tony Blair, a devout Christian who nonetheless recognized that religion could be divisive and should therefore remain a personal matter. Borrell, incidentally, became president of the European Parliament in July, 2004. Whence came these new ethical values? Certainly not from nature if that denotes the abiding and encompassing. They came from a small segment of human cultures that had utilized intelligence more than their neighbors, and had found ways to move beyond the dead hands of the past. If I am right about these new values, how does this affect Crosby? As a naturalist, he must admit that all that I am citing is part of nature?neither divine nor even transcendent. Yet he should also admit 10 Ian Black, The Guardian, May 29, 2003. http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/storv/0?965916,00.html</page><page sequence="14">Vol. 26, No. 3, September 2005 197 that it represents an innovation not directly driven biologically or universally. Quite the contrary. Democracy and human rights arose at a particular time and in particular places. Human creations, Yes. Universal human values?not yet, not by a long shot. Clearly I am urging Crosby to declare himself a humanist, rooting his vision in the aftermath of the Enlightenment and not claiming a universality of origin for it. Nature may tolerate these new values, but more than that would be hard to claim. It we tried to say that nature requires or even supports them, we would have to consider why it took so long for them to emerge. In 1952, Julian Huxley, having left UNESCO, declared that once we know the nature of evolution we are responsible for its future?and that there was a social evolution as well as a biological one.11 Richard Dawkins, more recently, coined the word "merne" to describe the persistence and replication of cultural themes. What the world needs now is merne change. And these ideas will not be found across nature or throughout nature. They are new, fragile, and essential. My final quarrel with Crosby is over his overly broad usage of "ecology." If ecology is the study of the environment of a life niche, and the ways that niches interact, it is a new and important science. But when ecology begins to choose sides and chooses a prehuman or nonhuman side, we need a word such as "ecologism" to indicate the shift. It is understandable, and within the lifetime of many in this audience, that the biblical idea of "dominion" was seriously challenged. I was teaching at Scripps College when Rachel Carson published Silent Spring,12 and she spoke at our commencement. Not only a new woman's voice at a women's college, but an authoritative scientific voice saying very new things. In retrospect, we know that humans have always manipulated their surroundings?burning forests for their farms, reducing or even eliminating species for their tables and foibles, shifting the paths of waters. At what point do these manipulations become dangerous? And dangerous to whom? Ecosystems? Future generations? Species? One solution was to see humans as intruders, destroying an otherwise sound 11 Julian Huxley, "Presidential Address: Evolutionary Humanism" in Proceedings of the First International Congress on Humanism and Ethical Culture (Utrecht: Humanistisch Verbond, 1953). 12 Rachel Carson, Lois Darling, and Louis Darling, Silent Spring (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962).</page><page sequence="15">198 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy and peaceful environment?human parasites. I urge all of you to spend some time with Murray Bookchin, an early environmentalist who later became a critic of those who termed themselves "deep ecologists."13 Crosby periodically veers toward this deep side, and I suspect it is because he has spent too much time in the parks and mountains and not enough in urban jungles. For better or worse, that is where history has taken humans, and that is where our created environments must be reshaped to make urban life more tolerable. Two years ago, a group of us published an anthology entitled Ecohumanism where we tried to reevaluate human needs of physical sustenance, on the one hand, and aesthetic pleasure on the other (city and wilderness).14 And to do so in ways that saw human flourishing as more central than the preservation of prehuman statuses. We should not have to choose between operas and birdsongs. My regret is that our publisher turned down my cover jacket choice. An artist colleague had redone one of the famous Edward Hicks's "Peacable Kingdom" series. That good Quaker artist had shown lions lying down amidst lambs and the whole biblical fantasy. In Paul Darrow's contemporary version, every animal's mouth was crunching upon some smaller creature. And in the ocean behind this scene, a happy human swimmer was being closely pursued by a shark. Crosby describes his debt to Albert Schweitzer for showing him something of the real Jesus. My Schweitzer memory is of his repeated phrase "I am life that wills to live, in the midst of other lives that will to live." He too had read his Darwin, and he too eventually moved beyond the simple but contradictory faith of his childhood. If nature is all, and humans are an evolutionary emergent of that nature, then our scientific reading will have to deal with an ongoing and messy story, and our assessments will be subject to continual revision. The merit of this readable and excellent book is that it turns us away from fruitful speculations and points us in naturalistic directions. 13 Murray Bookchin, Re-enchanting Humanity: A Defense of the Human Spirit against Antihumanism, Misanthropy, Mysticism &amp; Primitivism (London: Cassell. 1995). 14 Robert B.
