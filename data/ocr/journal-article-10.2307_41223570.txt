<plain_text><page sequence="1">Local MBAC materials in the Arabian Gulf and their manufacturers Elisabeth C.L. During Caspers Over the past years I have devoted considerable attention to archaeological materials in the Arabian Gulf originating from the late Bronze Age oases of Central Asia, nowadays called the Margiano-Bactrian Archaeological Complex, the MBAC (Sarianidi 1993: 251-264), because, so far, it has been studied most thoroughly in Bactria and Margiana. The important archaeological discoveries in Soviet Central Asia and the material remains recovered from the various Bronze Age settlements in the ancient oases of the Kara Kum desert have attracted a great deal of interest. These oases are generally known by their better known Classical names of Margiana and Bactria. The principal Bronze Age sites of Kelleli 1, 3, 4, Gonur 1 and Gonur South, Togolok 1,21 and 29, are located in Margiana; in northern Bactria are Sapalli Tepe and Djarkutan; in southern Bactria: Dashli 1, 2, 3; and in eastern Bactria: Shortughai. In a recent article Lamberg-Karlovsky (Hiebert &amp; Lamberg-Karlovsky 1992: 1- 15) has argued that in both Bactria and Margiana there is only limited archaeological evidence for settlement prior to the end of the third millennium and the earliest Bronze Age agricultural settlements within the Margiana oasis have strong affinités with the Late Namazga V archaeological cultures of Southern Turkmenistan. The archaeological evidence thus suggests the establishment of substantial communities in Margiana by 2200 B.C. In the succeeding Namazga VI Period, around 2000 B.C., there is a uniformity of material culture which extends over Bactria and Margiana (Gonur 1, Togolok 21, Sapalli and Dashli 3), indicating that the distribution of this Bronze Age Culture in the Bactrian oases was both extensive and uniform. The duration of this MBAC is still unclear, but radiocarbon dates from three building levels at Gonur South suggests a duration of no more than 250 years for the MBAC, thus dating it to ca. 2100-1750 B.C. (Hiebert &amp; Lamberg-Karlovsky 1992: 1).</page><page sequence="2">48 Local MBAC Materials However, it needs stressing that a typical MBAC zoomorphic copper/bronze stamp seal representing a humpless, short-horned bull was recovered from Nausharo IB in Central Baluchistan which is dated by Jarrige before 2600 B.C. (Jarrige 1993: 156) and this would not agree with Karlovsky's date for Kelleli 4 of 2000-to early 2nd millennium B.C. Characteristic MBAC archaeological materials have been discovered in regions far from Central Asia. Such objects have been recovered in Iran from Susa, Shahdad, Shahr-i Sokhta, Hissar, Khurab, and from Tepe Yahya. In Pakistani Baluchistan MBAC material remains have been recovered from Mehi, Shahi Tump, Mehrgarh VIII, Sibri, Nausharo and Quetta. Here it must be made clear that there is every reason to believe with other scholars working in this field that the MBAC has entirely indigenous roots and that there is not a single site in Pakistani and Iranian Baluchistan that offers the slightest evidence for a local development of the Murghabo-Bactrian culture. In fact, the materials recovered occur in an intrusive context within a regionally defined local archaeological culture. In a recent article (During Caspers 1992: 3-28) I mentioned the MBAC objects from the Mehi and Khurab cemeteries and unpublished material from Khurab, housed in the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, U.S.A. was published by C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky and D. Schmandt Besserat in 1977 (Lamberg-Karlovsky &amp; Schmandt Besserat 1977: 1 13-134). The topic of the present paper justifies a quotation from the article by Hiebert &amp; Lamberg-Karlovsky in which it is stated "Thus we are confronted by a major archaeological question affecting a very large geographical territory: What were the cause(s) for the southward movement of peoples from Central Asia to widely scattered regions of the Iranian Plateau and Baluchistan? We must distinguish between the movement of peoples from the movement of objects and/or styles by exchange and/or stimulus diffusion. We believe that the evidence recovered from burials on the Indo-Iranian borderlands strongly supports the contention that we are dealing with the actual movement of peoples. The cenotaph at Sibri, the "Quetta Hoard", some of the individual burials at Shahdad, and the burial identified as Li at Khurab appear to contain materials that are exclusively of Central Asian origin. This evidence suggests that the people buried in the tombs, with an exclusively Central Asian material inventory, came from Central Asia. It is important however to point out that at Khurab, Shahdad, and Khinaman(?), there are burials of several periods which appear to include tombs that (1) contain material exclusively of Iranian type, (2) contain material of Iranian type with an object or two of Central Asian origin, and (3) contain, in the rare instance, material exclusively of Central Asian derivation. A re-examination of these cemeteries, with a careful eye toward</page><page sequence="3">During Caspers 49 discriminating grave lot associations and their chronological indicators, would be a productive undertaking. Nevertheless, the presence of burials containing an exclusive material inventory of Central Asian type suggests the movement of peoples from this region to the Iranian Plateau. Why?" (Hiebert &amp; Lamberg- Karlovskyl992:3). Contrary to the situation prevailing in the Indo-Iranian borderlands, the evidence for Central Asian contacts with the Arabian Gulf is of a very different nature. Although the great majority of the objects showing a strong liaison with the MBAC archaeological inventory have, likewise, been recovered from graves, in the Arabian Gulf they can be readily divided into two categories, since some can be viewed as MBAC imports, while others are clearly imitations or adaptations of a Central Asian prototype. First I want to turn to the pedestalled goblets to which I have made frequent references in recent years (During Caspers 1989: 19-20; 1992: 3-28; 1994: 33-53). The unpainted, redslipped, pedestalled goblet with the characteristic thickened plastic ridge at the junction of the cup and the splayed stem from JAli and the dark grey-black pedestalled goblet with the characteristic thickened plastic ridge at the junction between the cup and the hollow splayed concave foot from mound S-100 at Sar el-Jisr, both on Bahrain can be regarded as imports. The pedestalled goblets with or without a plastic ridge between the cup and the splayed stem decorated with either geometric patterns or stylized caprids or gazelles from the Dhahran tumuli of Saudi Arabia and from the Hamala North mound, the JAli grave, mounds S-54 and S-100 at Sar el-Jisr and City II at the Qala^at al-Bahrain, all on Bahrain, as well as from one of the Suq-Sunaysl graves in Oman must be seen as locally made in the Gulf itself. Secondly, I want to draw your attention to the copper/bronze goblets from Hamala North, Bahrain and from Alignment A grave A 2 at Asimah (Ras al- Khaimah), U.A.E. which undoubtedly are MBAC import pieces (PL 1,1-2). The latter has been described as almost identical but slightly smaller than the one from Hamala North (Vogt 1994: 1 16-129, Figs. 54,3, 55,1-2, PL 18c) and is the one C.S. Phillips has referred to at an earlier occasion and which was said to have been found in conjunction with a typical Central Asian weapon (During Caspers 1992: 9; Vogt 1994: 116-129, Figs. 54,4, PL 18 a-b). In the third instance, we are presented with MBAC material from Tomb A at Hili North in the al-Ain Oasis in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, U.A.E., in the form of a small chlorite cosmetic flask with a circular neck decorated with a dotted circle on each side, which is considered to be an import from the Murghabo-Bactrian cultural</page><page sequence="4">50 Local MBAC Materials complex (Cleuziou &amp; Vogt 1985: Fig. 4, no. 5) and with the presence in the same collective tomb of a type of copper/bronze chopping-knife which compares with similarly shaped knives with asymmetrical sides from Central Asia (Vogt 1985: PI. 28, no. 1, 9). A somewhat similar find has been recovered from tomb N at Hili (Vogt 1994: 125). A similarly shaped copper/bronze object was recovered in the 1992 excavation campaign at Tell Abraq (Emirate of Umm al-Quaiwain), U.A.E., in a late Umm an-Nar context (Potts 1992, PI. on p. 2; During Caspers 1994: Fig. 15) and others were also recovered from Burials 148 and 117 of the Burial Complex at Sar el-Jisr on Bahrain (Mughal 1983: PI. LII, no. 3, Fig. 26, nos. 5-6). The so-called 'razor' blade from Alignment A grave 2 at Asimah (Vogt 1994) falls in the same category of chopping-knives as the ones mentioned above, the only difference being the somewhat short curved tang, which, however, compares with Pottier 1984, Fig. 16, nos. 95, 97, PI. XV, no. 95. The next finds which should be considered in my argument are a small group of chlorite vessels of the Série Récente from the Oman Peninsula, namely Grave A at Hili North (Abu Dhabi), U.A.E., the settlement of Maysar-1, Oman, Umm an-Nar Grave 1059 at Hili (Abu Dhabi), U.A.E., Qatarrah, and Tomb B in Ajman, U.A.E., as well as from graves in the Burial Complex of Sar el-Jisr on Bahrain (During Caspers 1994: 50, notes 40-45). The sides of these round chlorite containers are decorated with closely spaced, horizontal lines, extending from top to bottom (PI. II, 1). They imitate round pottery containers found in the MBAC inventory where they take the shape of a yurt, the lid reproducing the domed roof and the container the dwelling part. In imitation of the material of which these yurts were originally made, the outside of the container and the pointed lid were decorated with closely set parallel grooves applied when the clay was still wet (Sarianidi 1986: 109-1 11, Abb. 27, figure on p. 110) (PL II, 2). The tiny, two cm. high copper/bronze horned animal, probably a goat, from the Hamala North mound on Bahrain (During Caspers 1987, PI. I, 1; 1991, PL 11) is either a decorative piece to be sewn on to a garment or meant to serve as a pin head. Additional support for its possible Central Asian affiliation comes from the Oman Peninsula (During Caspers 1994: 43-45). Three pendants or repoussé plaques made of gold or electrum representing two-headed and two-torsoed caprids, decorated with incisions are reported from the Wadi Suq long grave at Qatarrah (Cleuziou 1978-79: 44; Id. 1981: 289-290, Fig. 13; al-Tikriti 1989: 105, Pis. 74D, 95B; Potts 1990: 253-254, PL IX). Two of the pendants aie reinforced at the legs by one or a pair of additional legs and are fitted with hooks or loop-attachments at the back. A repoussé plaque, thought to be a lion(?), and a silver bull figurine were found with them (Cleuziou 1978-79: Fig. 1 and 3 on p. 44). Two complete pendants and one</page><page sequence="5">During Caspers 5 1 fragmentary one portraying two goats standing back to back have come from Site 99 at Shimal and Site 2 at Dhayah (Ras al-Khaimah), U.A.E. (Kastner et al. 1988: PI. 9); and an electrum pendant in the shape of two-headed and two-torsoed goats or caprids with hooks at the concave back, the legs reinforced by an extra coating of silver, have been discovered in a long collective tomb at Bidya 1 (Fujairah), U.A.E. (al-Tikriti 1989: 105, Pis. 74 A, 95B). Walid Yasin al Tikriti has argued that "Despite the difficulties in identifying the source of these pendants, we should not exclude the possibility of local production as an increasing number of them has come to light over the past few years from tombs dating to this period" (al-Tikriti 1989: 105), i.e. the Wadi Suq period. I think, that we should take Walid Yasin's notion of a possible local production into serious consideration but then acknowledging the emphatic influence of the Central Asian animal art (PI. III). The fact that the goat figurine from Hamala North, Bahrain, is not concave at the back like the pendants mentioned above, or the two gold bull pendants from the "Quetta Hoard" in central Baluchistan which consists entirely of Central Asian objects (Jarrige &amp; Usman Hassan 1989: 153-160, Figs. 8-9), although it does share the presence of a loop-attachment soldered onto one side with these others, makes one wonder whether the Bahrain goat is not, in fact, a theriomorpic head of a cosmetic pin, since in Bactria and Margiana these tiny animal figurines do stand on a base which is a part of the pin itself. The loop-attachment could then have been soldered on later, but as this tiny piece is badly corroded there is a very small chance of ever being able to prove or disprove this suggestion. For the time being, we should treat this goat figurine as a possible local imitation of a MBAC prototype (During Caspers 1994a: 45). Often cited is the anthropomorphic bronze handle of a mirror, in the shape of a small, naked male figure from Barbar Temple II A on Bahrain which stands on a fan-shaped sockle showing rivet holes and a curved slit which is a misconceived copy of copper/bronze MBAC mirrors (Rao 1969: 218-220; During Caspers 1973: 128-132). The latter have a handle representing a stylized female figurine, but the Bahrain handle, modelled on a Sumerian matrix, has to be turned upside down in order to render it usable. However, credit should be given to M.S.N. Rao who, already in 1969, inferred the function of the fan-shaped end of the sockle below the feet as the place where the mirror proper had to be inserted by reference to the copper/bronze mirror from Mehi, which at that time was still an unrelated item. H. Crawford also considers both the figure of a copper bird and cylindrical vessels from a Barbar HA context as links with Central Asia (Crawford &amp; al Sindi 1995: 1-4). A better candidate for being a Murghabo-Bactrian import is the ivory comb from a Umm an-Nar tomb at Tell Abraq (Emirate of Umm al-Qaiwain), U.A.E.,</page><page sequence="6">52 Local MBAC Materials dated to the last three centuries of the third millennium B.C. by D.T. Potts (1994: 620-622, Figs. 53.6, 53.7, 53.8) (PL IV). This date is somewhat higher than the overall date suggested by Lamberg-Karlovsky for the MBAC material. On both sides it shows an incised decoration consisting of two long-stemmed flowers with crenate or dentate leaves, facing either side of a triangular configuration composed of three dot-in-circle patterns. Another prime candidate is a bifacial stepped stamp seal from the mound field at Hamad Town, Central Bahrain. This shows a winged lion with gaping jaws and two antithetically placed wolves, if that is what these creatures really represent, on the obverse side (During Caspers 1994: 106, note 32; Crawford &amp; al Sindi 1 995 : 1 -2, Figs. 1 -2). When we turn to the still growing category of prismatic-shaped stamp seals from the Arabian Gulf, on which I have reported in 1993 (During Caspers 1994: 97- 107) a different picture emerges. In contrast to the recovery of MBAC stamp prisms proper in Central Baluchistan across the Gulf (Santoni 1984: 56), the prism-shaped stamp seals from Oman (Maysar-1) and Bahrain (one from Grave 1(?) at Al-Hajjar, two from Saar settlement, and one without provenance) (Weisgerber 1980a: PL 77; Id. 1980b: PL 15; Id. 1981: PL 54; Crawford 1993: Fig. 9; Moon et al. 1995: Fig. 16; Vine 1993: Figure on p. 48 on bottom row left) do not warrant the designation proper and genuine and only the island of Failaka has furnished items which may be called genuine Central Asian imports (During Caspers 1994: 101-102, 104). In fact, a recently published fragmentary triangular prismatic blank made of steatite from the Northern City Wall Excavation of the Qala'at al-Bahrain on Bahrain which by means of a secondary drilling had been converted into a pendant (Kjaerum 1994: 339-340; Fig. 1755) now leaves no further doubt that prism-shaped stamp seals were also made locally in the Arabian Gulf, which accords with the locally imitated Central Asian materials we have been discussing. As far as we can tell at the present moment towards the close of the third millennium B.C., the lingua franca in the western part of the Arabian Gulf may well have been either Sumerian or perhaps a Semitic language. We have no such information about the eastern sector of the Gulf except for the fact that we have textual information on a courier named Libur-beli, who on behalf of a merchant with the name Lu-Enlilla, certified a transaction to purchase copper from Magan. The relevant Ur text dating to the beginning of the reign of Ibbi-Sin (in fact the second year of this monarch), i.e. 2027 B.C. mentions that 'the tablet of Libur-beli in the dossier (lit. 'container') of the merchandise' was 'put in a ship for Magan' (Potts 1990: 145). Cleuziou et al. refer to Mesopotamian cuneiform texts mentioning three persons with Semitic names who had come from Magan (Cleuziou et al. 1994: 465, note 20). From this one could assume that in certain cases, or perhaps in certain</page><page sequence="7">During Caspers 53 circles, cuneiform script could be read or at least was understood. We do have potsherds with Indus script from Ras al-Junayz and the Ras a-Hadd region indicating that although perhaps only on a restricted scale, the Meluhhan language was used. Potsherds with incised Indus script have also been recovered from cities like Moenjo-daro and Harappa in the Indus Valley Regions. We have already referred to the fact that the Arabian Gulf has produced hybrid archaeological materials showing local, indigenous Gulf traits combined with Murghabo-Bactrian characteristics. Such objects have not yet been reported from the Pakistani and Iranian Baluchistan areas on the other side of the Arabian Gulf. There we find only genuine MBAC objects in conjunction with material belonging to the local archaeological inventory. MBAC and local archaeological material inherent in the Arabian Gulf areas do occur together as we have shown, but the presence of imitations of MBAC materials, mixed with either genuine MBAC and/or proper Gulf objects, has so far been attested only in the Arabian Gulf itself. Lamberg-Karlovsky has suggested that the evidence recovered from burials on the Indo-Iranian borderlands strongly supports the contention that we are dealing with the actual southwards movement of Central Asian people (Hiebert &amp; Lamberg- Karlovsky 1992: 3). Kohl and Pottier on the other hand maintain that, at least as far as the Bampur Valley and southern Baluchistan are concerned, "the present evidence does not support a large-scale movement of peoples into the Bampur Valley or southern Baluchistan". "Continuity with the local tradition is manifest", these authors argue, "and the Central Asian materials might be more economically explained as resulting from contacts, possibly established during annual migratory cycles, with new peoples now living immediately to the north". They continue: "... no matter, what form relations between the Mehrgarh area and Central Asia took during the late third millennium, they should have been more intense and regular than those intermittently effected by peoples living in the Kej and Bampur valleys. Possibly hemmed in to the south by Harappan seaports stretching westward to Sutkagen-dor" [possibly even into the eastern edge of coastal Iran, note author] "and to the north by immigrants from Central Asia, the peoples of southern Baluchistan largely maintained their own cultural traditions and did not participate exclusively in either sphere of influence" (Kohl &amp; Pottier 1993: 101). We do not yet know whether these Central Asian peoples possessed a written language, but Parpóla has suggested they used a pre-Indo- Aryan language (Parpóla 1993: 49). Through their close relationship with the Indus people back home they were in any case familiar with at least some of the Indus signs, which can be demonstrated by the fact that the short end of one of the MBAC cylinders seals from Sibri near Mehrgarh in Central Baluchistan (Shah &amp; Parpóla 1991: 412, Sb-2E, C,</page><page sequence="8">54 Local MBAC Materials E) has a stamp showing a 'mountain* sign which has been published in Mahadevan's Concordance of Indus texts as variant no. 1459 (Mahadevan 1977: 789). The Indus 'mountain' sign on the stamp end of the Sibri seal, however, is associated with what may be sign no. 389 or a variant thereof, thus forming a combination not encountered in the Indus sign corpus. A second Murghabo-Bactrian cylinder seal, housed in the Department of Oriental Antiquities of the British Museum, London and said to have come from Seistan, Iran, shows a partly extant inscription of six Indus characters, but at least one man-sign has no counterpart in the Indus script and the sign sequence of the pictograms still present is not known from the Indus inscriptions (Knox 1994: 375- 378) (PL III, 2). The broken top could well have supported a suspension ring the more so as the bottom end bears a stamp showing a triangular configuration. Although unfortunately damaged, enough remains of it to see that the base end bears a distant variant of the 'mountain' sign of the Indus script, which, however, in the proper Indus script does not occur as such. The Murghabo-Bactrian cylinder seal from Sibri with the so-called Indus sign on its stamp end and that in the British Museum with its so-called Indus inscription can, therefore, be placed in the same category as the group of round Indus stamp seals with their bull iconography from Southern Mesopotamia and the Arabian Gulf. The latter show Indus inscriptions displaying obvious differences in their sign sequences and have signs not known from the Indus Valley stamp seals proper themselves. Since Hunter these stamps from Southern Mesopotamia have been regarded as belonging to acculturated Harappans or Indus people long settled and integrated into Mesopotamian society and although using Indus characters, they are thought not to convey the Meluhhan language. The non-Harappan sign sequences of these round Indus bull stamp seals have been described as having belonged to merchants of Harappan origin living in Mesopotamia. These Harappans, it was argued, had either as a result of a process of cultural integration, or for other, subtler reasons, adopted Mesopotamian names but were still maintaining connections with their home country in order to regulate the Mesopotamian-Indus trade both ways. Evidence of an integration of Indus Valley people in Near Eastern society is provided by cuneiform Ur III texts and this assimilation as these texts clearly indicate, involved among other things their adoption of Sumerian names. The round Indus stamp seals with bull iconography recovered from Southern Mesopotamia, primarily Ur, with their divergent or dubious sign sequences, were consequently regarded as being archaeological evidence of this process of acculturation mentioned in the cuneiform texts. The deviant order of the Indus pictograms on these stamps was assumed to be used to 'translate' Sumerian or a Semitic language. One could, of course, argue, that if they</page><page sequence="9">During Caspers 55 were acculturated, they would have used cuneiform for their Sumerian/Semitic names but why then would they have altered the Indus sign sequences if this was for the folks back home. This argument needs showing up. In this context it is of interest to note that Parpóla, Parpóla and Brunswig even refer to the fact that the role of the Meluhhan village, especially its complete integration into the economic structure of Ur III society, implies that many generations had passed since its (hypothetical) foundation as a Meluhhan trade colony (Parpóla et al. 1977: 129- 165). These first Meluhhans who are already referred to in Akkadian contexts as a 'Meluhhan-ship-holder', as 3Su-ilisu, Meluhhan interpreter', or as DLu-Sunzida, a man of Meluhha' (Parpóla et al. 1977: 130-131, 160), who had come to Mesopotamia (and Elam?) to supervise their businesses, may still have used their normal square stamp seals bearing a genuine Meluhhan message or name. In my last contribution to the Seminar for Arabian Studies in 1993 (During Caspers 1994: 97-107) I have, in fact, referred to the square Indus Valley stamp seals proper from Mesopotamia and to the occurrence of Harappan influenced stamp and cylinder seals from the Near East, dating from Akkadian to Isin-Larsa times. Unfortunately we are still left with the question whether it is logical, or even realistic, to assume that the Meluhhans and their offspring living in the Near East would have acted differently from the way other minority groups have done in the past and still do. Either such groups tend to assimilate by adopting the language, customs, and even religious practices of their new homeland so that their own cultural traditions gradually slip away, or, like for instance many Jewish communities in Europe in the past and many Chinese in South-East Asia, they steadfastly uphold their own traditions, culture and religion and keep themselves aloof from their new surroundings. Both examples, nevertheless, would through sheer necessity adopt the language and the script of the culture in which they now lived, in order to be able to function normally in their new society. Would not the Indus people, particularly their offspring, whether one or both of their parents were Meluhhan and who on the evidence of the cuneiform texts had already adopted Akkadian/Sumerian names, some even not yet readily understood, soon after their arrival, would not these 'new Mesopotamians' or 'new Sumerians' at least have tried to learn to write and speak the language of their host country? As we have seen, even in Ur III times they were still involved in economic and commercial activities which must have required a command of Sumerian. The absence of square Harappan stamp seals from the Arabian Gulf and the absence of textual evidence from Mesopotamia makes it hazardous to suggest that a situation comparable to that in Southern Mesopotamia also existed in the Gulf areas. There is very little, if any, archaeological material which in the light of the present</page><page sequence="10">56 Local MBAC Materials low chronology for the QalaDat al-Bahrain, that is to say the Northern City Wall Section, could match the archaeological evidence from the Near East for a Harappan existence in Akkadian times. City la-Ib is dated in the late Akkadian period and the twenty-one round stamp seals, the three impressions and the six unfinished seals from this Northern City Wall Section are from a City Ila-c context, which is from the early Ur III to the late Isin-Larsa periods (ca. 2075-1880 B.C.). No seals, either square or round, have been reported so far from a City I context (Kjaerum 1994: 319-350). This implies that all the round stamp seals with Indus boss and bull iconography are late third to early second millennium B.C. The few round stamps with bull and Indus script found at Failaka are equally late. This low date for the round stamp seals with Indus boss, bull and Indus script from the Gulf does, therefore, not altogether tally with the date ascribed to some of the round bull and Indus script seals from Mesopotamia, particularly Ur. In Mitchell's view (Mitchell 1986: 278-285) his Type I, which he calls the Indus group and Type II, by which he designates the local copies of Indus seals, range from late Early Dynastic III to early Akkadian, Akkadian to late Akkadian and Larsa times In 1994 A. Parpóla published an analytical catalogue of the Indus inscriptions from the Near East (Parpóla 1994: 304-315) which contains a total of nine inscriptions from Bahrain and Failaka, six on round stamp seals, one on a prism stamp seal, one graffiti on a potsherd and one on a rectangular bifacial stamp seal. None is what he calls Indus Harappan, meaning that the seal contains guaranteed Indus script with only native Harappan sign sequences and/or purely Harappan iconography and object type, probably exported from the Greater Indus Valley. In all the other instances the inscriptions are thought to have been fashioned in the Near East and have sign sequences which to a larger or lesser degree do not warrant the nomenclature Indus Harappan. To quote Parpola's typology they are called Native Harappan (lx), Probably Native Harappan (2x), Harappan (3x), Acculturated Harappan (lx), Probably Acculturated Harappan (lx), Possibly Harappan (lx). When we compare Mitchell's Type I Indus seals and II local copies of the Indus style, all from Ur, with the ones from the Arabian Gulf, we see that the one of Mitchell's Type I which he regards as Akkadian to Ur III is Acculturated Harappan in Parpola's view, the one with a Ur Ill-Old Babylonian date is Harappan and the three without stratigraphie context are Acculturated Harappan, Probably Acculturated Harappan and Harappan. In the case of the Mesopotamian stamp seals, can the difference in sign sequences be explained as a need to find the nearest possible 'translation' of the Meluhhan language into their newly adopted Semitic/Sumerian mode of conversing? Might this then also be the reason why so many signs on these Indus</page><page sequence="11">During Caspers 57 stamps are not regularly-used signs in the Indus script and, therefore, not commonly used in the Indus Valley? But then, they would only have used these seals in connection with the Indus people proper. On the other hand, one could question whether it is feasible to assume that these 'new Mesopotamians' still had such an outstanding knowledge of their original mother tongue as to be able to remember these signs, even after one or more generations, when one would assume, even though Meluhhan might still have been spoken in their homes in Mesopotamia, most likely the need for writing Meluhhan had become fairly limited. Although Parpóla, Parpóla and Brunswig maintain that "the tone of the Ur III texts gives the impressions that the Ur III Meluhhans had very little contact with their homeland" (Parpóla et al. 1977: 153) still it appears valid to suspect that Ur III Meluhhan would rather show a tendency to archaism and preserving old forms than any degeneration in the language. Much depends, I feel, on the way in which we view the so-called Meluhhan inscriptions from the Arabian Gulf. Can we be confident that these also belonged to 'new Sumerians' or 'new Mesopotamians'? Since seals are personal possessions, marks of individual ownership or authority, these examples must be regarded as genuine and not as trade items or fashionable imitations. Consequently we have to assume that the owners most likely resided in the Gulf and used them for trading purposes or other mercantile activities. The question which arises from this supposition is who were their trade associates who were able to understand this 'pidgin Harappan'. Most certainly not the Meluhhans back home in the Greater Indus Valley. Perhaps some of the merchants or businessmen in Mesopotamia who used the same kind of seals with a 'pidgin Harappan' inscription. Obviously, both groups were closely linked. If we assume, as other scholars do, that the Indus bull seals with these 'pidgin Harappan' inscriptions from Mesopotamia belong to acculturated Harappans or Meluhhans, than consequently the same pertains to the Arabian Gulf and in particular to its western sector, since the evidence for a similar situation in the eastern sector of the Gulf is still far too slim to be of any use. Despite various computer programmes devised by Russian, Finnish, Indian and American teams of scholars and despite many valliant attempts, primarily by Indian scholars, to decipher the Indus Valley script, which has been seen as Proto- Dravidian, Proto-Elamo-Dravidian, Sanskrit, Brahmi, Karoshti, for over sixty years this Indus script has kept its secrets and still cannot be read. There is no archaeological evidence that the Indus Valley script proper was used outside its own cultural environment or that it was understood in neighbouring areas, let alone used. Yet, at the beginning of this paper I referred to two instances where Indus script was utilized by non-Harappans. One was the stamp end of a</page><page sequence="12">58 Local MBAC Materials MBAC cylinder seal from Sibri in Central Baluchistan, Pakistan, and the second case is the so-called MacMahon cylinder seal, housed in the Department of Oriental Antiquities of the British Museum, London, which is also of Murghabo-Bactrian origin and said to have been recovered from Seistan. We have seen that in the two latter cases the inscriptions could also be designated as 'pidgin Harappan'. However, the archaeological inventory of Mehrgarh VIII, Sibri, Dauda Damb and the "Quetta Hoard" in Central Baluchistan is exclusively MBAC and further instances of the use of Indus or related signs by indigenous peoples in southern Baluchistan where only in the rare instance material exclusively of Central Asian derivation has been encountered, is so far absent. The archaeological inventory of the Arabian Gulf where indigenous Gulf objects are recovered together or mixed with exclusively MBAC and/or MBAC derivations is so far unique. It might be possible to make a deduction from the two seals from Central Baluchistan and from Seistan that the Murghabo-Bactrian world had a knowledge of the Indus script through their cultural and/or economic ties with the Indus Civilization. Furthermore, there is archaeological evidence to suggest that the two cultural environments did indeed have a close relation, therefore it seems feasible to exchange the 'new Mesopotamian' or 'new Sumerian' label which has for so long been stuck on the round Indus stamp seals with bull iconography and their Native Harappan, Probably Native Harappan, Harappan, Acculturated Harappan, Probably Acculturated Harappan, or Possibly Harappan inscriptions for the idea of them having been the possessions of Murghabo-Bactrians who had come to the Gulf, most likely on trade missions eventually to settle down and from there to Southern Mesopotamia, perhaps in conjunction with the Indus people who entered the Gulf by the end of the third millennium B.C. This might also explain the presence of originally MBAC material which was adapted and transformed to local Gulf taste. A good example of the Indus Valley-Murghabo-Bactrian symbiosis are the two lengthwise perforated three-faced steatite prisms from Bahrain. One is the well-known stone prism from Grave 1(?) at Al-Hajjar (Weisgerber op. cit.) (PL III, 3) showing on one of the three sides two opposing caprids or gazelle-like animals, a short-horned bull with lowered head opposing a scorpion on the second and four Indus characters with Harappan sequences although the normal direction of writing from right to left has been reversed, on the third face. Parpóla regards this prism as Native Harappan. The other example is a stone prism-shaped stamp seal also with a lengthwise perforation published by the National Museum of Bahrain without the seal's provenance. (Vine op. cit.) (PI. Ill, 4). One of its three surfaces is occupied by two unidentifiable animals (objects?), one of the two remaining sides depicts a bull with lowered head, whereas a four-sign inscription in Indus characters, identical to</page><page sequence="13">During Caspers 59 the one seen on the Al-Hajjar prism, figures on the third surface. Parpóla does not mention this prism stamp but would, undoubtedly, have also called it Native Harappan had he done so. When we take into consideration the Murghabo-Bactrian cylinder seal from Sibri in Central Baluchistan with its so-called Indus sign on the stamp end and the cylinder said to have come from Seistan with its hybrid Indus inscription and its so- called Indus sign on its stamp end and these two prism-shaped stamp seals from Bahrain with their identical Native Harappan inscriptions and their typical Murghabo-Bactrian shape, and we realize that these prisms could also be made locally in the Gulf, we are drawn to the conclusion that the underlying language of the Harappan inscriptions we have been dealing with in this paper, may not be those of Sumerian or Semitic-speaking people of Harappan descent. One of the most fundamental objections being that since Sumerian or Akkadian was most probably the only lingua franca in the Near East at the time of the occurrence of the round Indus bull stamps, its would seem only natural that the acculturated and integrated 'new Sumerians1 should have used or at least have tried to use the officially accepted Sumerian or the Semitic language which happened to be in vogue in matters of commmerce and to write it in order to unequivocally establish their new status. Matters may well have been very much different for the Murghabo-Bactrians who had come to the Arabian Gulf and the Near East. There are no references to them being integrated like the Indus people, and we therefore do not know whether there may not have been much need to learn how to speak and write the lingua franca of the Gulf or of the Near East for that matter. Their visits may not have been long enough to produce any offspring and even it they did, their spouses may well have been local Gulf women who neither spoke nor could write Sumerian. We have mentioned earlier that we do not yet know whether these Central Asians possessed a written language, although a pre-Indo-Aryan language has been suggested, but we have seen from the two cylinder seals from across the Gulf that they will certainly have been familiar with the Indus script (During Caspers forthc). In fact, back home, in their cultural/economic dealings with the Harappans they may have adopted a kind of 'pidgin Harappan'. This may be the 'pidgin Harappan' what we encounter on the round Indus bull stamps and what may be the closest 'translation' of the language of the Murghabo-Bactrian people either into the Semitic/Sumerian mode of conversing which was the lingua franca at that time or else into Meluhhan. The bull and manger iconography which we invariably see on these stamps must have been borrowed from the Indus Civilization and, since round stamp seals form a constant factor in the MBAC glyptic inventory, they used the shape they were familiar with. Being farmers, like the Harappans, the Bactrians were undoubtedly</page><page sequence="14">60 Local MBAC Materials familar with cattle; therefore, to portray homed bulls would not have created an iconographie problem. They may have taken it as their 'trade mark' in their overseas mercantile transactions. The suggestions put forward in this paper are far from conclusive, but I have endeavoured to point out some incongruities which should be taken into serious consideration. PLATES Plate 1.1.
