Investigations in the 1990s have a very different tenor and focus from those in the 1890s, but this is not surprising, given the progress made in organology over the past cen- tury. In this article I shall describe and examine the trends of the 1990s and show how they differ from or resemble those of the earlier decades. I shall also critically discuss recent scholarly publications and other contributions to the debate about the methods and significance of classifications of mu- sical instruments throughout the decade. The discussion is necessarily se- lective, focusing on writings that exemplify research trends.1 To begin, we need briefly to visit the scene of a hundred years ago, and to note in our journey across time how approaches to research into the classification of instruments have changed since then. It is also construc- tive to compare its development with that of the classification of biologi- cal specimens, for although instrument classification studies eventually de- veloped structurally similar methods, its progress lagged behind biology's, as a comparison with Mayr's historical survey of classification methods in biology (Mayr 1982) shows. In the first three decades of the century, little of importance was pub- lished in the field apart from the well-known Hornbostel and Sachs scheme (1914). This scheme divides musical instruments at the highest level into ? 2001 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois 283</page><page sequence="2">284 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 four categories and subdivides them in a fairly systematic fashion at lower levels, using a Dewey library-like numerical system to distinguish specimens of instruments from each other at the most specific level. The number of publications burgeoned in the 1930s and 1960s, leading to a peak of inter- est and productivity in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by somewhat of a decline in the 1990s. However, two books appeared at the turn of the de- cade-one, On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments by this author and the other, Issues in Organology, edited by Sue Carole DeV- ale. The latter book contains core studies by a collection of authors about various cultural and technological groupings of instruments and related his- torical aspects. The former critically draws together contributions made to the history and theory of the classification of instruments, comparing them with the history and theory of biological classification. It makes compari- sons between classification schemes and the concepts that govern them across a number of music-cultures, distinguishing between those schemes that are imposed by observers ("observer-imposed") and those that emerge informally from a culture ("culture-emerging"), with the former usually being literarily-transmitted and the former orally-transmitted. The book also discusses how these schemes reflect the prevailing musical thoughts and concepts of or about instruments in a society, some of them being indica- tive of the specific cultures from which they come and others embodying threads of thought found in many music-cultures. The classification of musical instruments began to be investigated in earnest in Europe from the late nineteenth century, after centuries of reli- ance on the binary string-wind classification (used or implied from the ar- chaic Hellenic period (i.e. the sixth and early fifth centuries (BCE)2 or the ternary string-wind-percussion division (dating from early in the common era).3 Museologists were motivated in part by the practical need to system- atize, catalogue, display and store the large collections of instruments that had been acquired by museums from the eighteenth century onwards. In 1880, Victor-Charles Mahillon published the first systematic scheme of in- strument classification suitable for worldwide use, designed mainly for use in cataloguing the substantial collection of instruments from around the world housed in the Brussels Conservatory Instrumental Museum. The study of classification was also motivated by the desire to advance musicological research. By 1914, the study of the classification of instru- ments had become an important branch of systematic musicological endeav- or. The modified and expanded version of Mahillon's scheme put forward by Erich von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs in 1914 was intended to provide a universalist classification of the world's instruments for both museologi- cal and scholarly use. Classificatory work in the first half of the 20th centu-</page><page sequence="3">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 285 ry served as a basis for cross-cultural comparisons and for the construction, by scholars such as Curt Sachs (e.g. Sachs 1940, 1962), of "highest laws" (Adler 1885 [Mugglestone 1981:151), which amounted to universalist or general theories about music and musical instruments. The secret of the success-in its widespread adoption-of the Horn- bostel and Sachs4 scheme is that it is a truly international system. The nu- merical system used to distinguish specimens of instruments at the most specific level proved to be a powerful means for finding and identifying instruments. Moreover, being essentially numerical rather than lexical, it is free of false linguistic connotations (Montagu, written com. 1998). For example, when scholars refer to Southeast Asian "clarinets" or "oboes," they could hypothetically suggest to a European-oriented reader or user that these instruments share the materials, ergonomy and structure of Europe- an clarinets and oboes, which would, of course, be false. For this reason it was important that the verbal content of the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme be translated from the original German into several languages. For exam- ple, it was translated into Finnish by Timo Leisi6 and into Catalan and Span- ish by M-Antonia Juan, with the most widely used translation, that into English by Wachsmann and Baines, being published in the Galpin Society Journal in 1961. The scheme has been and still is widely used in museums across the world. When its users refer to an instrument by its Hornbostel and Sachs number, they know it can denote the same instrument across cultures, despite the fact that particular instruments have different names in different languages (Montagu, ibid.). For this reason, the Hornbostel and Sachs system, despite its inevitable imperfections, has served the develop- ment not only of the science of organology but also of comparative cross- cultural thinking around the world. Of course trends and emphases keep changing in organology as in any other field of research. From about the 1930s, a few museologists and musicologists began to criticize the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme and at- tempted to improve it. Some were less interested in the detail and more in the logic and completeness of a scheme. Andre Schaeffner, for example, felt the need to develop a perfectly logical bipartite scheme at the Musee de l'Homme in 1932. The English writer Francis Galpin developed two schemes (1910 and 1937) and included a new category of electrophones. Meanwhile Jaap Kunst criticized comparative studies by scholars such as Sachs on the grounds that too little precise knowledge had been accumu- lated in many societies to warrant drawing comparisons, indeed that it was dangerous to generalize about anything until all the facts were in (Kunst 1959). Another trend then emerged. Scholars narrowed their topics of in- quiry down to detailed studies of particular instruments and ensembles.</page><page sequence="4">286 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 Collectively they covered many music-cultures, past and present, usually in a multi-faceted way and taking account of the social context as well as the usual acoustic and morphological characteristics of instruments. The Scandinavian writers Tobias Norlind (1932) and Karl Izikowitz (1935) were the early conceptual thinkers behind this trend. Although Norlind did not put forward his own method of classification, he developed a broad concept of what an instrument represents, suggesting that elements of performance practice, nomenclature, geographical distribution and cul- tural history should be taken into account alongside such matters as mor- phology, tone quality, and scales. Karl Izikowitz embraced an even broad- er concept of instruments. He adhered rigidly to a general classification of instruments according to acoustic principles, but nevertheless suggested that the study of instruments as material objects ought to lead to investiga- tions of the cultural, ceremonial, and social functions associated with them. The dissatisfaction of these two scholars with the narrow concept of in- struments that lay behind classifications until this time prepared the way for a broader view.5 The German scholar Hans Heinz Drager also adopted an inclusive view. Finding single-and limited-character division to be inadequate for his com- plex concept of instruments, he simultaneously considered a large number of distinctive characteristics at each step of division, not just one or a few. He was perhaps the first organologist to engage in highly detailed classifi- catory thinking, though he did not take the further conceptual step of ac- tually classifying similar kinds of instruments by upward grouping. Drager simply added his cluster of variables, or "facets" as Michael Ramey later called them (Ramey 1974), to the entries of the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme, also-like Galpin-adding a fifth, so-called "electrophone" class to their classes of idiophones, membranophones, chordophones, and aero- phones. Drager's clusters included technomorphic and acoustic facets, fac- ets determining an instrument's ability to produce single or multiple voic- es, and facets relating to musical movement, tone, duration, loudness, dynamic range, registeral range, and timbre. They also included so-called anthropomorphic factors, which were derived from relationships between the performer and the instrument (Driger 1948:12-22). In fact, then, Drager made an important theoretical contribution to the field. After clarifying the task and the limitations of downward taxonomy by logical division, or Systematik (Systematics) as he called it, he distinguished it from the detailed cultural-historical, sociological, and philosophical stud- ies of instruments, thus clearing the way for the development of an upward, microtaxonomical or faceted mode of classificatory thinking. He was one of the first scholars to make a major contribution to a more comprehensive classificatory study of individual instruments (Kartomi 1990:178-81).</page><page sequence="5">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 287 Interest in problems of instrument classification-as opposed to musi- cal instruments themselves-had, however, waned somewhat by the 1950s. Such studies were simply not in fashion. A number of ethnomusicologists had come to regard "European systematic organology" (Montagu 1996:78) as a rather dry research topic. By allegedly concentrating too much on struc- tures and technological, ergonomic developments of instruments, some found it to be too little concerned with what really ought to interest us, namely the living music-cultures in which the instruments are used. In the 1960s, Alan Merriam argued in his influential Anthropology of Music (1964) that music should be studied not just as sound and technology but in the full context of its social meaning. Merriam's approach served as a catalyst in the field of ethnomusicology, encouraging scholars to make fully con- textual studies of music, including musical instruments. Between the 1970s and the mid-1980s, a number of scholars in Europe, North America, Britain, Australia, and elsewhere focused on making increas- ingly detailed studies of specific instruments in context, bringing a mix of acoustic, morphological, ergonomic, biological, ethnographic, anthropolog- ical, sociological, and historical facets to their studies. Arising from them, some systematically-inclined organologists devised new classificatory schemes, still attempting to solve the problems of classifying instruments logically and inclusively in context. Among schemes devised were those by Montagu and Burton (1971), Mantle Hood (1971), Ramey (1974), Malm (1974), Heyde (1975), Hartmann (1978), Sakurai (1980/1), Mitani (1980), and the working models published by CIMCIM in its bulletin6 (1983-4, 1985, 1987; see Dournon 1992:252).' Ramey was one scholar who made significant progress towards detailed upward classification by "faceted grouping" (Ramey 1974) or "grouping by inspection" (as the biologist Mayr called it, see Mayr 1982), developing Driger's method with the aid of a computer." Most of these scholars thought it necessary to develop very close, detailed classificatory methods, yet none of the new schemes they devised succeeded in replacing the one developed by Mahillon and expand- ed by Hornbostel and Sachs, which remains in worldwide use in museums and scholarly endeavors to this day. Nor did they develop an upward meth- od of classification to match the upward method arrived at in biology in Hellenic Greece and revived again in Europe two centuries ago (Mayr 1982). Downward classification by logical division developed over 2,000 years ago in Plato's writings and is commonly found in many of the world's cul- tures. For the upward classificatory method to develop, it was necessary to adopt a concept of specimens that allowed for their variability and changeableness. Such a concept was, however, very old. Aristotle was strongly aware of the complexity and variability of specimens and ridiculed the idea of classifying biological specimens in an elaborate, downward,</page><page sequence="6">288 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 logically-based hierarchy. He was interested in species rather than genera, and chose to classify them at low levels of generality by detailed inspec- tion (ibid.: 150). But his followers were misled, and applied logical division even to biological specimens. It was not until the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries, between the publications of the botanist Adanson in 1763 and the naturalist Darwin in 1859, that downward classification was ques- tioned and gradually replaced by upward classification based on "popula- tion thinking." This thinking rejects the notion of the "typical, average in- dividual" and focuses on the detailed individual, not the type (ibid.:263). In biology, the empirical, upward method is now employed by every mod- ern taxonomist, at least in the initial stages of the classifying procedure (ibid.: 192). It was not until 1969 that a method of close classification of musical instruments based on upward thinking was devised. Oskir Elschek (1969a, 1969b) began to classify a large corpus of European folk aerophones by scanning their attributes.9 First he made a close, detailed inspection of mouthpieces and other aspects of the aerophones. He then classified them according to increasingly higher levels of generality, in order to isolate variants, groups of variants, and types. Elschek devised a set of special graph- ic symbols for his method, which he dubbed typological. However, Elschek defines the term differently from biologists. To him, "typological" means a "method based on scanning the totality of the data and isolating variants, groups of variants, and types," whereby a type is not, however, to be re- garded as a paragon or archetype (Elschek 1969a:33). Typologies are based on a multi-character or multi-dimensional method of arranging objects ac- cording to the simultaneous intersection of categories. Following in Driger's footsteps, Elschek distinguished his method from the systematic approach adopted by Hornbostel and Sachs and other down- ward-thinking taxonomists. Elschek described systematics as a preliminary sorting of instruments into classes, in which the initial sorting is based on an act of perception or intuition, and only sometimes reflects historical relationships, whereas typology, he wrote, is based on empirical observa- tion and historical implication. He continued the comparison by pointing out that in systematics, any perceptual initial sorting soon gives way to logically-based ordering, as the aim of reaching abstract generalizations at the uppermost level begins to be realized. Systematics, he said, is not de- signed to depict or classify the complex details of variable forms of the same or similar instruments, as is needed in a first study of a collection of instru- ments, e.g. folk aerophones; nor is it designed to depict the complex de- tails of historical change in instruments. After detailed research into indi- vidual specimens in their theoretical, technical, and historical aspects, he orders the detail with the aim of grouping the instruments by type.</page><page sequence="7">Kartomi. The Classification of Musical Instruments 289 While Elschek argued that a clear distinction needs to be made between the systematic and typological approaches, he did not, however, recom- mend throwing out the baby-the Hornbostel and Sachs system-with the bath water. He wished to use his typological method in addition to the systematic, indulging not only in upward but also downward as well as lateral thinking. Thus he saw typology as complementary to systematics. In fact he recommended starting a taxonomical study of a group of instru- ments by identifying and sifting them into groups with the aid of the Horn- bostel and Sachs or other systematic scheme. At the second stage, he sug- gested, each instrument should be studied in detail and classified typologically into variants, groups of variants, types, and groups of types, proposing these names as working terms. At the third stage, he recommend- ed, the low-level groupings of the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme should be compared with those derived typologically, serving either to endorse or correct them. The procedure then continues to alternate between down- ward, macrotaxonomic thinking and upward, microtaxonomic thinking, in order to clarify any problems that may remain. Greater notice needs to be taken of Elschek's contribution to the taxo- nomic study of instruments (1969a, 1969b). As a scholar working from the 1960s in the relative isolation of eastern Europe, his contributions to instru- ment classification theory and practice have not yet been taken very seri- ously: certainly, they are not yet widely accepted nor even understood. Picken, for example, has argued that it is unnecessary to devise an upward scheme such as Elschek's because the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme can easily be adjusted to remedy any apparent inadequacies (Picken 1975:569). Yet, as Elschek argued, the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme is in fact essen- tially static and ahistorical, designed as it was to cover all possible instru- ments independently of time and place. Simply to expand Hornbostel and Sachs's method or empirically to adjust it is not to solve all problems, for the upward and the downward methods of Elschek and Hornbostel and Sachs respectively have essentially different purposes. The so-called typo- logical or-to use a commonly used term in biology-microtaxonomical method aims at making precise, ordered investigations into minute detail and then proceeds to construct low-to medium-level classifications of groups or variants of instruments. Conversely, systematic or macrotaxonomical method aims at providing a useful means of information storage and retrieval of all or many instruments, beginning at the high-level classification of spec- imens and moving to lower levels. The two methods are complementary; and both clearly need further refinement (Kartomi 1990:201-2). By the 1990s, scholars on the whole had stopped creating new large- scale classification schemes, finding little point in re-inventing the wheel over and over again. A notable exception to this, however, is the scheme</page><page sequence="8">290 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 put forward by Genevieve Dournon (Dournon 1992). Growing out of her twenty years of experience as a museum curator and her study of the col- lections of the Mus&amp;e de l'Homme, Dournon's scheme is intended to be a conceptual tool with a practical application.10 She blends the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme with the bi-partite system devised by Andre Schaeffner (1931, 1932), a theorist whose publications have not had the widest in- fluence. Schaeffner divides instruments into two principal categories, de- rived from the uniform principle of the nature and structure of the vibrat- ing material:" those with solid vibrating bodies (subdivided according to whether flexible, susceptible of tension or not); and those in which air is the primary vibrating factor. A consideration of the means by which the instrument is set in vibration is optional, and may not occur at the same level of subdivision when applied across the four categories of the Horn- bostel and Sachs system. Dournon argues that the adoption of an unambiguous primary division such as that provided by Schaeffner enables the curator to resolve the per- ceived difficulties in the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme: the lack of a uni- form standard for establishing lower order categories (a problem also iden- tified by Sakurai 1981:824), the crudity of high-level divisions, the consequent borderline cases, and the high level of generality. The scheme's intelligibility and applicability are thus improved. While Dournon retains the Dewey numerical code as a useful "open" system, her concern is to avoid too great an increase in the number of digits. By incorporating aspects of Hornbostel and Sachs' system, she is able to avoid the problems of Schaef- fner's system, particularly in the classification of idiophones, which is the most challenging category. By way of demonstration, Dournon leads us through a great variety of the world's instruments in order to discover the common features that link an abundance of forms. Ultimately, however, the test of the system she proposes will be its practical applicability, if it is widely adopted. As we have noted, Dournon's effort at devising a comprehensive classifi- cation system stands alone in the literature of the 1990s. There is a clearer realization now that no single scheme can ever be devised that is suitable for all purposes and satisfies the demands both of inclusiveness and logic. True, a number of scholars have treated the Hornbostel and Sachs system as a flexible nucleus for expansion, concentrating their efforts on the close study of certain key areas. But in the process of improving the accuracy of a given classification of particular instruments, scholars have increasingly paved the way for a deeper integration of downward and upward typolo- gies. In addition, recently, some scholars have felt an urgent need to col- lect data about the indigenous and localized concepts and classifications of musical instruments in many fragile music-cultures before they disappear,</page><page sequence="9">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 291 along with the widespread destruction of natural habitats, creatures and traditional life-styles in a globalized world. Concomitantly, there has been a shift of focus from the search for universals to inter- and intra-cultural commonalities between classification schemes and their components. There is also a new trend to study schemes that have emerged natural- ly among groups of jazz and popular musicians for practical music-making purposes and for reasons of ideology or identity. For example, from the early 1960s, folk music enthusiasts in the USA tended to distinguish elec- tric from acoustic instruments, while rock and roll players classified the guitars in their ensembles mainly by manufacturer. This latter trend is reflected in the layout of the Nashville Music Instruments Museum's Roy Acuft Musical Collection at Opryland, where instruments are arranged by manufacturer groupings (verbal communication from James Mannheim, see Kartomi 1990:285). The Hornbostel and Sachs System as a Flexible Nucleus for Taxonomical Expansion One of the key publications of the 1990s is the collection of essays entitled Issues in Organology, edited by Sue Carole DeVale (Selected Re- ports in Ethnomusicology VIII, 1990). This book contains several articles touching on theoretical and practical issues facing organologists who are interested in classification theory and practice today. Unlike in earlier stud- ies, the authors focus not on "the perfect classification" but on the process- es, results, and socio-musical significance of classificatory thinking in vari- ous historical periods and cultural contexts. Several of the articles usefully extend our knowledge of concepts about instruments and their classifica- tions, or contribute case studies of indigenous or local instrument classifi- cation schemes that have not previously been studied. In one article, a research team comprising Michael Bakan, Wanda Bry- ant, Guangming Li, David Martinelli, and Kathryn Vaughn at the University of California at Los Angeles suggested a useful, indeed ingenious, way of classifying amplified and electronic instruments within the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme, but without adding a fifth category of electrophones.12 In the decades since Hornbostel and Sachs published their scheme, rapidly developing technology produced electric and electronic instruments that do not fit logically into any of that scheme's four major categories. As the five authors point out, sequencers, sound processors, amplified, and elec- tronic instruments which do not produce sound directly are logically in- appropriate within the parameters of the Hornbostel and Sachs system, because it is based on a concept which holds instruments to be sound-pro- ducing objects. However, within Western culture and its areas of influence,</page><page sequence="10">292 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 electrophones are considered to be an essential part of the musical creative process and may therefore be incorporated into that scheme. In any case, the system proposed by the team is not intended to be the one and only way of classifying electric and electronic instruments. On the contrary, it is to be seen as one possible model which others may be stimulated to use to accommodate the inevitable future changes in electronic technology and their effects on musical instruments. Though they were unaware of it at the time, the authors' close study of a group of instruments and their classification follows in the footsteps of two earlier generations of organologists, that of Elschek and his students and colleagues. As we have noted, Elschek adopted a typological approach to the study of instruments, beginning by systematically organizing data associated with an instrument at the most specific level, and then moving upwards to ever higher levels of generality until he reached a set of high- est-level categories, such as Hornbostel and Sachs' four categories of idio- phones, membranophones, aerophones, and chordophones. Bakan et al. also made close studies of instruments, suggesting that details of each relevant instrument be incorporated into the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme by adding a clarifying suffix at the end of its classification number, which is derived from the existing scheme. For example, the let- ter A may be added to an existing classificatory number for an instrument which is amplified, or the letter E for an instrument that produces sound electronically; thus an electric guitar would be classified as 321.322-E. Some other instruments proved more difficult to classify. They include the "scratch turntable" used in rap music, an instrument which can, however, be classified as an electric scraped idiophone and be given the number 112.2-E. It is necessary, they write, to create an entirely new classification scheme for instruments such as sequencers and sound processors, which do not directly produce sound but whose application drastically alters the way in which played tones are finally heard (see their Appendix E). Their classificatory thinking is based on a chain concept that links the perform- er, the instrument, the modifier, and the acoustic space receiver. Another trend-from the 1980s-has been to re-emphasize the fact that the human body is a musical instrument. In all likelihood it was the human body that was the first instrument to produce music. To this day, it remains one of the most versatile and complex of instruments and has frequently been used as such in new music over the past few decades. Vocal music, which human beings can produce with their brains, throats, vocal cords, tongues, mouths, and lungs, ranges from the subtle and intimate to the most dynamic and virtuosos, as in Balinese kecak music, where dancers repeat the percussive syllable cak in elaborate interlocking rhythms. Likewise, percussive music produced by the human body ranges from the breathtak-</page><page sequence="11">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 293 ingly fast rhythms produced by arm and hand chest-beating-as in Acehnese seudati music (Snouck Hurgronje 1906)-to slow to moderately fast rhyth- mic drones-as in the accompaniment to Australian Aboriginal women's ceremonial singing of the Western desert (Kartomi 1980). A term first proposed by Olsen (1980) for the category of instruments that comprise body parts is corpophones. The category has ancient origins, however. As Jairazbhoy has asserted, the corpophone category "seems to have been anticipated (at least in a general sense) in ancient India where we find reference to gatra (human body)" (Jairazbhoy 1990a:72). It is true that the Indian writer Narada in the early second millennium CE included the singing voice and hand clapping in one category of his five-category classification of instruments (Narada 1920). But members of a number of other ancient music-cultures have also regarded certain uses of the human body as being analogous or homologous to the uses of musical instruments and have reflected this in their classifications. For example, Hellenic Greeks distinguished between animate and inanimate instruments. In the second half of the century, then, organologists have been able to refine the parameters by which the higher-level classes can be defined and applied in classifications, through close typological studies of particu- lar groups of instruments. For example, in a music-archaeological study of instruments used in the ancient Harappan culture in the Indus valley, Reis Flora emphasized the need, as more specimens come to light, for a more sophisticated analysis and understanding of the materials of instruments than the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme can offer for their classification (Flora 1998). In another study, Flora's detailed organological description and systematic analysis of the fingering patterns and performance tech- niques associated with the Hindustani shahnai and the Western symphon- ic oboe suggest that their respective morphology and associated perfor- mance techniques are so different that they require reconsideration of their usual classification as organological cousins (Flora 1992). Several scholars recently suggested that amendments be made to se- lected instrumental categories or sub-categories in the Hornbostel and Sa- chs scheme on the basis of close study of individual specimens. In 1997, for example, Le Gonidec published a proposal for a "universal" classifica- tion of flutes (Le Gonidec 1997), based on the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme (421: Edge instruments or flutes). The article draws in large part on her analytical study of 1200 examples of flutes in the collection of the Musce de l'Homme in Paris. Not surprisingly, the theoretical positioning of her work shows the influence of the classificatory ideas of both Andre Schaef- fner (to whose memory her article is dedicated) and Genevieve Dournon (under whose aegis she carried out her work), particularly in its thrust to- wards high levels of specificity in the lower classificatory divisions. It is in</page><page sequence="12">294 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 this latter aspect that the strength of her system is to be found, inasmuch as her careful observation of the construction, ergology and acoustic be- haviour of flutes across cultures has the potential not only to solve flute- classificatory problems but to change established organological ideas about the cross-cultural phenomenon of flutes. Following Schaeffner, as does the work of Dournon, Le Gonidec's point of departure is the nature and structure of the vibrating material. Again like Schaeffner, Le Gonidec argues that the physical structure of the instrument, not its playing method, should be the main criterion of class, so that the classificatory divisions and nomenclature arise from the intersection be- tween the way the air is set in vibration and the structure of the instrument, focusing particularly on the morphology of the mouthpiece and its relation- ship to the edge. Le Gonidec preserves Hornbostel and Sachs's first level of distinction between flutes without duct (where the musician's mouth or nose "forms" the duct) and flutes where the duct is part of the body of the instrument (Le Gonidec 1997:26). From this point, however, her system begins to di- verge from that of Hornbostel and Sachs, as she introduces the relationship between the mouthpiece and the edge at the second level of classification, producing three categories (end mouthpiece and edge, end mouthpiece and shifted edge, side mouthpiece and edge) as against Hornbostel and Sachs's two (i.e. end-blown [421-11] and side-blown [421.12]). She dismisses Hornbostel and Sachs's distinction between instruments having a single tube (421.111) and or a set of tubes (421.112) as not really pertinent to the classificatory process.13 Similarly, the presence or absence of fingerholes does not appear as a principle of subdivision in Le Gonidec's scheme. In- stead, she proceeds through a system of opposition towards an increasing- ly complex classification of the mouthpiece device. The article is generously illustrated, not just with examples of the instruments cited, but also with diagrams illustrating the various properties of the mouthpiece that form the basis of the scheme. A glossary of organological terms used is appended. As Le Gonidec's classification of the recorder clearly shows, one conse- quence of the increase of specificity afforded by the lower orders of her scheme is a significant increase in the number of digits needed to complete the descriptive cataloguing of the instrument-a factor which may mitigate against the scheme's practical application. In the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme, only the most general and unspecific features of the instrument determine its classification, generating four groups of numbers. Dournon occupies a middle ground between the broad generality of Hornbostel and Sachs and the high level of specificity of Le Gonidec, incorporating extra features concerning the position of the mouthpiece and some details of its morphology to produce six characterizing digits after the general class num-</page><page sequence="13">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 295 ber (411 [Flutes], Dournon 1992: 279, 283). Le Gonidec, on the other hand, produces ten descriptive subdivisions (the greatest number in her scheme) which follow the general class number (421), further refining the description of the duct and the mouthpiece to the point of apparently complete specificity (Le Gonidec 1997:36). While Dournon, as a practical museologist, was at pains to avoid the excessive multiplication of digits, it is difficult to see how this could be so, if the aim of classification is exactness of description. Continuing the expansion of the aerophone category, Montagu a sub- stantial study of reed instruments leading to a critique of the reed section of the Hornbostel and Sachs classification scheme. In the first fascicle of a catalogue of his own collection of reed instruments, he proposes a new classificatory procedure for reed-blown winds (Montagu 1998). He argues that their classification should not be based on Hornbostel and Sachs' cri- terion of the type of reed (whether single, double or free), because that aspect is irrelevant to the instruments' acoustic behavior. Instead it should be based on the shape of the bore, which has a fundamental acoustic ef- fect on the instrument's performance and has the benefit of being imme- diately apparent to the non-expert eye of some general museum curators, and would therefore mitigate against incorrect classifications. Montagu also disputes the basis of Hornbostel and Sachs' classification of aerophones, i.e., that the air itself is the primary vibrator, where "pri- mary vibrator" means "what it is that generates sound." This criterion, he points out, applies only to flutes. In the case of reed instruments, the pri- mary vibrator is one or more idiophonic lamellae or reeds, while in the case of brass instruments, he argues that it is the player's lips. He admits that the length, shape, and vibratory mode of the coupled air column establish- es the pitch of wind instruments proper (classified under the Hornbostel and Sachs category number 42). However, in the case of free aerophones (classified under 41), Hornbostel and Sachs defined the vibrating air as being "not confined by the instrument," which is problematic. Southeast Asian mouth organs, for example, will only sound when coupled to an air col- umn via fingerholes; thus the free reed, like any other reed, is used on tubes with finger holes, which then come under 422.3, among the wind instru- ments proper. Similarly, the pitch of organ reed stops is determined by the vibrating length of the reed, which is fixed by the bridle on the reed. How- ever, the length or volume of the pipe/resonator must match that of the reed or the coupled system will not function. The logical classificatory procedure, Montagu proposes, is to place each reed type under the appro- priate section of the numerical grouping 42, with the free reeds placed under 422.3, while reserving 422.3 for ribbon reeds. Then there could then be two separate sections for the flutes and the trumpets (e.g. numbered 41 and 42 respectively), he argues.</page><page sequence="14">296 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 In his catalogue, Montagu divides reed pipes, which Hornbostel and Sachs classified under the number 412, into three types: the concussion reeds (412.11) taken together with the double reed instruments (422.1), the percussion reeds (412.12) with the single-reed instruments (422.2), and the free reeds (412.13) taken together with the free reeds (422.3) and plac- ing the ribbon reeds (412.14) at the end, followed by a category of retreat- ing reeds (established by Henry Balfour through his labels and master la- bels in the Pitt Rivers Museum, but unrecognized by Hornbostel and Sachs), giving them the new number of 412.15. Also in 1998, a relatively accurate new scheme for classifying brass-wind instruments on the basis of their measurable acoustic properties was pre- sented by Arnold Myers. The high degree of precision of schemes such as Myers' could help curators to differentiate between sub-classes of instru- ments in a way that the Hornbostel and Sachs system cannot. Again, such precisely based schemes would not, of course, replace the use of the Horn- bostel and Sachs system in a multi-class instrument collection, but could serve as a useful supplement to it. Myers' research into the acoustic-based classification of brass-wind in- struments identified characters of division which depend solely on the geometry of the bore profile determined by the instrument-maker, relating it also to the characterization of the instrument as experienced by players and listeners. Eschewing vague though widely-used terms such as "cylin- drical bore" and "conical bore," he suggested substituting for them the following six measurable parameters: (K) a ratio of cross-sectional diame- ters expressing a kind of conicity; (C) a ratio of lengths expressing a kind of cylindricality; (V) the cup volume of the associated mouthpiece; (L) the length of the overall air column without operating any slide, key or valve; (Dmid) the bore diameter at the point of equal distance from both ends; and (Umax) the peak value of the horn function as a measure of the prop- erty of a bell flare (the bell flare reflects sound waves of various frequen- cies, trapping part of the sound energy inside the instrument and letting part escape). The result of assigning critical values to these six characters is a rigorous classification scheme, which successfully distinguishes all the most common and many of the rare types of brass instruments. This classifi- cation scheme would be of use to museums containing varied brass-wind collections14 and to scholars analyzing large sample populations.15 Not only acoustic studies but also the history of musical acoustics, es- pecially from the early seventeenth century, are relevant to our understand- ing of classification. Recently, Jamie Kassler has researched aspects of the mechanics and acoustics of musical instruments and their parts as models or experimental analogues of knowing, feeling and moving, drawing atten- tion to how classification has been understood in a particular historical</page><page sequence="15">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 297 period (for example, in Kassler 1995). She suggests that the Hombostel and Sachs scheme's reliance on acoustical aspects of instruments should be revised in light of changing knowledge of acoustics. Historical Comparisons of Classificatory Ideas An interesting addition to our knowledge of the beginnings of organol- ogy is found in the first of two articles contributed to Issues in Organolo- gy by the well-known Indianist ethnomusicologist Nazir Alli Jairazbhoy. This article gives an original account of the life and influence of the "catalytic agent" Sourindro Mohun Tagore on music in India. It mentions Tagore's contact with the pioneering curator, classification theorist, journal editor and author, Mahillon (1841-1924) who, as mentioned above, devised the first classification of instruments suitable for use worldwide. Jairazbhoy describes how Tagore, a wealthy "lesser raja" (Jairazbhoy 1990a:74), devoted a great deal of time to studying and propagating Indi- an music, donating examples of Indian instruments to many museums and institutions in Europe, the USA, and even parts of Asia. He gave many rare Indian instruments to the Royal Academy of Belgium, which then asked Mahillon to advise on their disposition and write a descriptive catalogue of them. Tagore also donated a collection of books and manuscripts in English, Bengali, and Sanskrit, some of which were written in English by Tagore himself. Jairazbhoy believes, with good reason, that Mahillon had read some of this literature at the time of developing his classification sys- tem. He was certainly acquainted with Tagore, and even published a bio- graphical essay on his life and work (ibid.:74-5). Jairazbhoy assumes that among the works which Mahillon read was an account of the four-catego- ry classification of instruments used (among other schemes) in India from ancient times and presented in the treatise Natya?astra (probably written in the first few centuries CE [see Bharata-Muni 1961]). He believes that Mahillon used this four-category Indian scheme as the basis of the system that he then developed for use in the Brussels museum and which later became the basis of the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme. A particular point at issue is the question of whether this indebtedness has been appropriately acknowledged. The similarities-and differences-between the fourfold classification of instruments in the Natyas~stra and the classification developed by Horn- bostel and Sachs have been noted by musicologists throughout the centu- ry (specifically Galpin [1910] 1965:27; Kunst 1959:56; Ellingson 1979:547; Deva 1980:128 and Kartomi 1990:62-63). Of course, Mahillon's and the ancient Indian schemes are not alone in exhibiting observable similarities. There are similarities between the basically three-, four-, and five-category</page><page sequence="16">298 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 schemes of many music-cultures-ancient and modern-the world over, which is hardly surprising given that many of them are based on the mode of sound activation as the main category of division at the highest level. An essential difference between the ancient Indian scheme and Mahillon's is that it is not, nor was it intended to be, a scheme suitable for world-wide use. The Indian scheme was developed with the specific needs of an an- cient Indian society in mind, just as Mahillon's scheme-with its three lev- els of sub-division-was designed to fulfil the quite different demands of late nineteenth century European society. In fact, Jairazbhoy's desire to discover "the first" culture or person to use a term contributes little to our understanding of instruments and related issues. Origin theories are not only unprovable but can be intellectually arid and sometimes even misleading. An Increased Focus on Local/Indigenous Concepts and Classifications Until about 1990, scholarly awareness of indigenous and other culture- emerging, localized classifications of instruments was almost non-existent. As noted above, I use the term "culture-emerging" to distinguish those so- called "natural" classifications that emerge informally from within a culture or sub-culture, whether expressed in oral or written form or both, from "observer-imposed" classifications that are conceived and imposed by an insider or outsider musician, scholar, or museologist, usually in written form.16 There is a gulf between classifications that emerge from within a culture or sub-culture and classifications that are conceived, indeed im- posed, from without, both in terms of goals and of conceptual frameworks. Culture-emerging schemes tend to reflect the broad socio-cultural ideas of the culture that produced them, including-in some cases-ideas about performance practice, the way sounds are produced, the other arts, reli- gion, philosophy, sound structure, social uses of instruments and ensem- bles, or combinations of two or more of these factors. Some classifications embody a culture's profoundest ideas or belief systems. Observer-imposed systems, on the other hand, are often based on the goals of the individual investigator, whether scientific, museological, or other. For example, they may be limited to morphological or acoustic aspects (Kartomi 1990:13). It was only in the post-Colonial period (post ca. 1970) that the culture- emerging classification schemes of various peoples began to be noticed as important sources for scholars. Among the first were discussions of Are'are (Zemp 1978), Minangkabau (Kartomi 1990:211-15, 216-25), T'boli (Mano- lete Mora, pers. com. 1987) and Finnish-Karelian schemes ( Leisi6 1977). One example of a recent article that extends our knowledge of indig- enous concepts and classifications of instruments is Victor Fuks' account</page><page sequence="17">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 299 of the classification, symbols, and meaning of the whole gamut of Wai~ipi musical instruments in the imperiled Brazilian Indian community in which they developed. Music and instruments, he writes, are ethnic markers that help to reinforce their culture's conception of its identity through various mythical and practical references, including references in performances to myths. Thus, instruments not only transcend time and space but also re- vive memorable experiences, induce emotions, and maintain the continu- ity of the culture (Fuks 1990:145). Fuks presents a classificatory scheme based partly on indigenous names of instruments and mythically-associat- ed animals, birds, or spirits, and partly on his own imposed categories, including the place and context of a performance (Fuks 1990:170-72). Steven Cornelius gives another example of an indigenous classification of instruments based on new data collected from informants in his article on musical instruments of Santeria in contemporary New York. From the ideological perspective of the local people, musical instruments fall under the provenance of various owning deities, whereby instruments made of iron belong to the warrior deity, gourds to the river goddess, and drums to the lightning deity. Three main types of instrumental ensemble used in public ceremonies are classified in a related manner. As Cornelius puts it, "Sacred conception empowers physical artifact" (Cornelius 1990:138). Among the articles in Issues in Organology (DeVale 1990) that expand our knowledge of indigenous concepts of instruments is Ellingson's illus- trated discussion of Nepalese Newar instruments, which embody the gods and other parameters, Harnish's study of the double-reedpreret of Lombok Balinese, Ledang's study of Norwegian bark flutes, and Olsen's discussion of Etruscan and Columbian Sinmi instruments. The concepts described as being associated with these instruments can serve as the basis of local classificatory thinking, or contribute to it. Garaj's 1998 typological research into Slovakian bagpipes, Schneider's 1998 study of folk aerophones, and Bachmann-Geiser's 1998 study of Swiss Alphorns also expand our knowl- edge of indigenous concepts of instruments. Oldroyd (1992:106) asserts that indigenous or local-as opposed to worldwide-classifications of instruments are "fascinating" but are not much needed as a search tool compared to the way that a reader may use the Dewey system in the library or the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme in museums and other." is partly true, yet museologists are in fact beginning to use indigenous schemes (where known) in addition to the widely- known Hornbostel and Sachs schemes in their public exhibitions, being more aware than in the past of the different kinds of explanatory power which they possess, as opposed to scholar-devised schemes. For example, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford recently used both the traditional Chinese eight-foldpa yin scheme and the Mahillon, Hornbostel</page><page sequence="18">300 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 and Sachs system in a display of Chinese instruments (verbal com., Marga- ret Birley). And the exhibition of the 1927 prison-camp-made gamelan Digul at Monash University in 1999 used a scheme developed by the Javanese scholar Martopangrawit, who divides gamelan instruments according to whether they "uphold" the melody (lagu) or the rhythm/meter/tempo (ira- ma), as well as the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme. By the 1990s, it had become clear that organologists need to collect much more data about both culture-emerging and observer-imposed classifi- cations. In fact, we know much more about the observer-imposed schemes of a very few cultures, especially those of nineteenth and twentieth centu- ry Western societies, than about the many culture-emerging schemes of societies in the rest of the world. Naturally, in societies whose beliefs, prac- tices, histories and classificatory schemes have been perpetuated largely by oral transmission (as in many Southeast Asian, Pacific, and West African societies), there is much less historical data available than in societies whose schemes have been transmitted mainly by literary means (as in many soci- eties in Europe, the Middle East, China, and South Asia). In the study of culture-emerging schemes, the scholar's task is to discover the relevant culture's semantic domains that govern a scheme, avoiding the importation of his or her preconceptions. Have many scholars taken up the call in the early 1990s to gather data about the ways in which various societies conceptualize about and classi- fy musical instruments? Several scholars have responded by making new case studies of the methods and reasons for developing indigenous/culture- emerging and/or scholar-imposed classification schemes, thus extending our knowledge of how and why societies classify instruments. Henry Johnson, for example, published an ethnographic survey of tra- ditional and modern schemes in Japan that are divided into two categories: the indigenous and the foreign. His is the first study to present an overview of Japanese classifications of instruments. He outlined both traditional and modern Japanese schemes, including the traditional hikimono, fukimono, and uchimono (plucked, blown, and struck object) scheme, with the lat- ter category subdivided into rubbed and shaken objects (Johnson 1996). This scheme has been in use since at least as early as the Heian era (794- 1185) along with several foreign schemes, including the Chinese pa yin (an eight-category scheme based on the main material of which an instrument is made). However, in everyday parlance, many Japanese still use a translated Western classification which they borrowed in the Meiji era (1848-1912) of intense Westernization, a scheme which divides instruments into the stringed, wind, and struck categories. In addition, many Japanese museol- ogists and scholars tend to use the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme - with</page><page sequence="19">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 301 a fifth category added for electric instruments-for practical purposes and organological research. Among the several recently proposed innovative schemes is a six-fold division of instruments devised by the Kunitachi Col- lege of Music in 1996 (Sumi Gunji et al., eds.). This scheme, which is based on an instrument's vibrating body, includes massophones (from rittai, sol- id [instruments]), cupophones (from kudoittai, hollow solid), clavophones (from bo, stick), tabulophones (from ita, board), chordophones (from gen, string) and membranophones (from maku, membrane). New schemes developed by Japanese scholars are used, in the main, only by organolo- gists, not museologists. Taken all together, these schemes reflect Japanese cultural values. As Johnson writes, "the profusion of downward classifications of musical in- struments in Japanese culture actually reflects Japanese social structure where special importance is placed on knowing one's place within a mul- titude of hierarchies" (Johnson 1996:27). Unlike the single-character classification of most earlier schemes, schol- ars studying culture-emerging classification schemes in the 1990s have usually adopted a multi-faceted approach, which included the relationships between the instruments and their social contexts. We have managed to extend our knowledge of previously unstudied, or insufficiently studied, indigenous classifications of instruments in selected music-cultures, past and present, including some music-cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, and the Americas. Still, however, schemes of many music-cultures throughout the world remain unknown. One geographical area of instrument classification studies about which very little research has so far been made is Aboriginal Australia.18 The songs and dances of the many Aboriginal linguistic-musical groups are accompa- nied by a total of approximately thirty "sound instruments" (Robin Ryan 1999), including gum-leaves (Ryan and Patten 1995), clapsticks, and the didjeridu, which were dispersed and exchanged via migration and trading routes. We know that Aboriginal hunters and gatherers traditionally classified the flora and fauna in terms of the local environment and culture in a highly intricate fashion, but we do not know how or even whether they classified their sound instruments. Ryan is currently preparing a typology of Aboriginal leaf reed instruments, but other Aboriginalist ethnomusicolo- gists have apparently not yet obtained such systematic data for typological study of other instruments in the field. One early observer-imposed scheme was developed in 1933 by the anthropologist Keith Kennedy, who divid- ed the Aboriginal instruments he had observed into four categories, i.e. percussion, friction, wind, and stringed instruments (Kennedy 1933). Lat- er some ethnomusicologists documented the existence of unique local in- stniruments in various parts of Australia, and sometimes classified them ac-</page><page sequence="20">302 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 cording to the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme. Alice Moyle listed collections of Aboriginal Australian instruments dating from 1899 and mapped them according to type, distribution, and function (Moyle 1966). In her view, Aborigines tended to recognize music events according to function rather than sound character (Moyle 1974:viii), which suggests that some groups may also have grouped instruments according to function. Another neglected but promising area of indigenous instrument classifi- cation research is found in the villages of modern Greece. According to Lambros Liavis, Greek villages commonly divide instruments into percus- sion (i.e. krousta, from an ancient Greek verb meaning "to hit"), wind (pneusta) and string instruments (enchorda), but no research has yet been carried out on this or other widely used localized classifications. The region- al divisions of Greece, the feasts and rituals, and the division between tra- ditional rural and popular music provide other approaches to the classifi- cation of instruments. Thus, certain musical styles and instruments are associated with each sub-region, town, and village, though with the growth of urbanization in the past century and a half, such units of difference have decreased. Likewise some instruments are associated with given feasts and rituals. And the demotikai (traditional rural music) and laikia (popular music) and associated instruments are commonly sub-divided into group- ings of two and three respectively; i.e. the demotika sub-divides into the akritic and the klephtik cycles of traditional music and the laika into the entechna, elafro, and rebetika genres of music. Kipps Horn is researching culture-emerging vocal and instrumental classifications of rebetika ensem- bles among communities in Greece and the Greek community in Mel- bourne, as well as a historically-based classification derived from data gath- ered on the evolution of rebetika music.19 The relationship between musical instruments and their social context also informs Bonnie Wade's study of Indian miniature paintings of the Mughal period (Wade 1998), which contributes, in the last of its six chap- ters, to an ongoing tradition of iconographical research in organology. Al- though Wade is concerned with identifying and cataloguing the types of instruments found in the miniatures and the ways they are depicted, she also puts forward an hypothesis about the political and cultural history of the Mughals which may be read from a study of the changing form of one of the instruments. Like Leisi6's findings, her data has enabled her to link morphological and ergological changes in instruments and their classifica- tion to social change. Identifying a distinctive rabab-type of plucked lute that appeared in Indian paintings produced during the Akbari period, she noted that the instrument had a distinctive mechanism for attaching the pegs. The instrument was absent from court paintings during the reign of</page><page sequence="21">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 303 the sultan Akbar, but appeared in miniatures commissioned at the rival court of his son, leading Wade to speculate that it may well be a symbol of new political independence at the time. Ethnomusicologists investigating those culture-emerging concepts about music and musical instruments which lie at the basis of the many indigenous classifications of instruments to be found around the world have noticed the propensity of music-cultures "to imbue their instrument classifi- cation systems and descriptions with culture-specific concepts, concepts which in turn enrich and mediate the systematic logic of their classificato- ry schemes ... (and) may include musical practice, theory, or genre, a world view and cosmology, gender and sexual dualism, and a plethora of other historic and sociological information" (Moore 1992:108). This trend led to the adoption in 1990 of a comparative organographic approach to the study and a search for commonalities in and distinctions between classifications across the cultures. Shift of Focus from Universals to Inter- and Intra-cultural Commonalities A concurrent trend in the 1990s has been the search for commonali- ties between classifications from different music-cultures and the music- groups within them. My own monograph, On Concepts and Classifications ofMusical Instruments (1990), presents a comparative organographic view of many music-cultures based partly on my own field data and partly on the field and historical data compiled by others. A major conclusion of the book, as was pointed out in some of the reviews, is that systems of classifying instruments tend to embody deep patterns of thought and experience that can vary with place and time in a society. Thus, as one reviewer put it, "Diverse cultures may share certain traits such as classifying instruments by sound excitation or materials, by function or by distinguishing between foreign and familiar instruments ... [and] classification systems . . . are al- ways compromises" (Moore 1992:109).The crux of the book , in the view of one organologist (Johnson 1996:27), is that "classifications are often synopses or terse accounts of a culture's , subculture's or individual's deep- seated ideas about music and instruments, as well as, in some cases, philo- sophical, religious and social beliefs" (Kartomi 1990:7). In fact, "only through a thorough knowledge of the place of each scheme in its own particular cultural web can it be understood in its own terms ... " (Kartomi 1990: 284). As Steven Feld wrote in his review, "the study of organology and the classifications of musical instruments [has] in recent years occupied an</page><page sequence="22">304 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 increasingly marginal position both in the anthropology of material culture and in ethnomusicology proper. This [book] reflects a shift both in theo- retical orientations and in ethnographic practices" (Feld 1993:367). Not only these shifts but also "the current critical and reflexive trends toward ex- amining how disciplines and discourses of knowledge and power are con- structed" (ibid.) make a revival of interest in the classification and other systematic studies of musical instruments "welcome." As he wrote, the book reviews the nature of instrument classification in relationship to various ideas and con- cepts about music emergent in different cultural moments [as well as] the impact of ethnoscience, folk systematics, and research on indigenous methods and procedures of classification.... [It] uses a great variety of sources to es- tablish the historical dominance of downward classification (tree diagrams) based on modes of playing technique and materials morphology, intersected to degrees by cosmology, gender, class. ... [It reviews] the emergence of the widely used method of Sachs and Hornbostel in this century... [and] challeng- es provided by recent work on upward classification of European folk instru- ments, and... societies oriented toward oral transmission. (ibid.:367-8) Though not all the facts about the world's instruments and ensembles are yet known, so much more is realized about the world's instruments than was even conceived of a hundred years ago, and so much more data is avail- able to be collated and systematized by computers or other labor-efficient means, that a relatively rigorous, comparative organographic analysis may at last become possible. If we succeed in collecting a broad sample of the world's orally-transmitted as well as literarily-transmitted classifications, we shall be in a position to draw some comparative conclusions about the na- ture, purpose, and types of classifications in various kinds of societies. At this stage of our collective research we need constantly to search for ways of piecing together the many extraneous studies of the world's instruments and ensembles, to compare them on many levels, and to construct them into an intellectual web for further inquiry. We need also systematically to examine and constantly to re-examine the practical and theoretical issues arising in classifications belonging to groups of musicians in different music-cultures and historical periods. Already the data indicate that schemes based on the mode of sound activation in different music-cultures resemble each other in form and content much more closely than schemes based on local ideolog- ical factors, with the latter showing a great diversity of form and content. International communication and discussion between scholars of mu- sical instruments and their classification is stronger in the 1990s than in previous decades. This is due in part to easier electronic communications between individuals and also to the frequent meetings of relevant study</page><page sequence="23">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 305 groups in international organizations such as the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) and the above-mentioned International Commit- tee for Musical Instrument Museums and Collections (CIMCIM). This healthy trend-which could, however, be further strengthened--has contributed greatly to the recently accelerating development of our thinking about and understanding of many of the parameters of musical instruments. Theoretical Issues In some of its theoretical aspects, scholarly discussion of the science of organology has developed from-or in relation to -the publication of my monograph (Kartomi 1990). The book aroused critical discussion of sever- al issues, such as observed shifts in theoretical orientation, the interpreta- tion of orality and literacy in transmitting classificatory knowledge, the relationship between classifications and concepts of instruments, the ide- ology of particular taxonomies, their nature in terms of practical museo- logical application, the complementary nature of upward and downward classificatory thinking, and the use of biological terms in classification the- ory when applied to cases of musical instruments. Feld expressed the view that deeper discussion of alternative and ex- tended modes of transmitting and organizing classificatory knowledge in different cultures and historical periods would inform and expand our think- ing about the intersections between orality and literacy and their cognitive impacts on various types of concept classification. This would indeed be a fruitful line of further enquiry. Other topics which Feld said needed to be further researched were the explication of the ideological character of particular taxonomic representations and the nature of taxonomies vis-a- vis historical projects involving the making of museum displays of cultural objects (Feld 1993). David Oldroyd's review (1992) extended the discussion in the book of the analogy between biological specimens and musical instruments. He commented on the consequences of the different nature of the two bod- ies of specimens vis-a-vis the treatment of problems in their classification. Classifications in biology and musicology are not exactly comparable be- cause taxa in biology are historically interrelated by evolution while instru- ments are fixed, static objects that cannot grow or adapt in themselves. While apes and human beings may be said to have some distant common ancestor (if I may extend Oldroyd's point), it is not sensible to say that vi- oloncelli and bassoons have a common forebear, nor even to say that vio- las and violins have the same ancestor or belong to the same lineage, even though the latter was developed after the former in historical succession.</page><page sequence="24">306 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 As we know, Darwin had to explain evolution (i.e., the product of an indi- vidual's improvement in adaptation) before he could convince anyone of the reality of the evolution of biological specimens. Thus the principle of natu- ral selection and adaptation to environment explains adaptation. This does not, however, apply to musical instruments because the concepts of evolu- tion and lineage are not applicable to anything but animate beings, which are able to inherit genes from their forebears and unintentionally vary them.21 It is partly for this reason that organologists need not slavishly follow the whole gamut of classificatory terms used by Ernst Mayr (1982) and oth- ers in the field of biology, but may use and apply terms differently accord- ing to the special requirements of the field of instrument classification. The historical sources show that in most cultures studied to date, people's knowledge of classifications of instruments has been limited to only the highest, or most abstract, level or step, which is usually the only level of terms that everyone in a culture remembers. For example, most school children in Western countries know the conventional division of instru- ments at the highest level into strings, wind, brass, and percussion (see Kartomi 1990:171; Dournon 1992:252), and most museologists and schol- ars of musical instruments know the Mahillon, Hornbostel and Sachs four- fold division of instruments into idiophones, membranophones, aero- phones, and chordophones. Moreover, most traditional Chinese musicians and scholars know the four or eight highest-level divisions of instruments in the two versions of the pa yin system, without, however, knowing the various close subdivisions of these schemes. The Increasing Tendency Towards Studying Particular Classes of Instruments Has Paved the Way for a Deeper Integration of "Downward" and "Upward" Typologies A debate arose in the 1990s about the epistemological nature of classifi- cation in organological research. Some scholars expressed the view that all classificatory thinking operates in an upward direction, moving from the specific to the general, pointing out that upward classification has ancient roots. Others were of the opinion that classificatory thinking proceeds not only in upward but also in downward directions, pointing out that down- ward classificatory thinking is also of ancient origins, in fact that it domi- nates most known classifications of instruments the world over, past and present. As they asserted, musicians and scholars in many cultures habitu- ally apply classifications at one or a very limited number of levels of high generality, for example, referring only to the three-category division of strings, winds, and percussion when describing a Western orchestra.</page><page sequence="25">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 307 The view presented in the On Concepts book is that classificatory think- ing tends to move between the upward, downward, and lateral rather than being restricted to one direction alone; and that no classification scheme, including that of Elschek (1969b), is normally developed by uni-direction- al thinking alone. This general idea is in fact quite ancient, being implicit in Plato's discussion of the first principles in the Republic and his ideas about dichotomous classifications in the Sophist (Oldroyd 1992:107). What is new and important about the initially upward-thinking method of instru- ment classification devised by Elschek is that it is a culmination of a grow- ing trend among instrument classification scholars from the early twenti- eth century to study the minutiae of certain instruments in great detail and then to classify them at increasing levels of abstraction, rather than start- ing at the highest level. As Elschek proposes, upward classificatory think- ing occurs only in the first stage of application of the typological method, followed by downward classificatory thinking, involving constant move- ment between the two. If we wish to study orally-transmitted as well as literary classificatory traditions, it is necessary to distinguish between four kinds of schemes. One is a taxonomy, which I have defined as a grouping of objects in various levels of taxa by sequential application of characters of division, where the taxa (group of characteristics) are distinguished by the culture or group that created it rather than being imposed intellectually by the observer. Anoth- er is a tree, i.e. a downward classification in the form of a branch diagram governed by one character at each step, or an arrangement of dichotomous oppositions imposed on a body of data by application of one character of division per step, cf. key.21 The third is a paradigm, i.e. a grouping of ob- jects by application of more than one dimension and simultaneously based on the horizontal and vertical intersection of facets. The fourth is a typol- ogy, i.e., a multidimensional or multicharacter form of arranging objects according to the simultaneous intersection of categories; it is an upward scheme governed by several characters per step. The first two kinds of scheme are uni-dimensional, while the last two are multi-dimensional. Scholar-imposed, or artificial, schemes normally take the form either of keys (tree diagrams) or typologies. Culture-emerging, or natural, schemes take the form of taxonomies or paradigms. Among the T'boli in the south- ern Philippines, for example, it is necessary to include both solo instruments and ensembles in the one scheme because some instruments are played only solo and others only in ensemble. Since the T'boli apply three main dimen- sions in simultaneous intersection in their classifications, their mode of classificatory thought is paradigmatic. At the turn of the century, we still need to ask new questions about</page><page sequence="26">308 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 trends determining change in classifications as well as disparate exceptions to them. For instance, how do classification systems change to meet, say, a sociological crisis? How do diasporas affect accepted schemes? And what may we conclude about different societies which use similar classification systems? (Moore 1992) It is to be hoped that increasing numbers of schol- ars will investigate such comparative questions about the nature of change in classificatory thinking and the schemes determined by it as well as the social and musical reasons that determine change in classificatory thinking in particular societies. Conclusion Advances were made in the 1990s in studying particular classes of in- struments which yielded systematic bodies of data organized in an upward direction from the specific to the general. The precise, detailed data was shown to improve the accuracy of classification of the relevant instrument class when used in addition to or as amendments to the schemes developed by Mahillon, Hornbostel and Sachs in the late nineteenth and early twenti- eth centuries respectively. Unlike in previous decades of the century, only one new classification scheme has appeared in the 1990s: Dournon's combination of the four-part Hornbostel and Sachs scheme with the bipartite principles of Schaeffner. This scheme has yet to be empirically tested. New schemes of the 1970s and 1980s such as those by Montagu and Burton (1971) and Sakurai (1981) have not proven influential enough to be consistently used in museums or for other practical purposes. Scholars have also more fully realized that no scheme can be perfect, indeed that any scheme must amount to a compro- mise between the demands of logic and inclusivity in the real world of instruments seen in their socio-musical contexts. This has led to a greater tolerance of the logical inadequacies of the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme. It is probably for these reasons that scholars of the 1990s have seen little point in producing more new schemes. Certainly, in part for reasons that lie beyond the scope of this discussion, none of these schemes have ever begun to rival the wide usage of the Hornbostel and Sachs scheme, either by itself or in parallel with other schemes. A rigorous, comparative organographic analysis of classifications of musical instruments and ensembles began to become possible in the 1990s, due to: 1) an increased focus (from about 1970) on orally transmitted, cul- ture-emerging concepts and classifications of instruments and ensembles; 2) a realization (from 1990) that such classifications, though apparently terse constructs in their outlines, are frequently based on multi-level, creative</page><page sequence="27">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 309 thought which is consistent with socially-influenced or structured ideas and belief systems; 3) an increasing tendency (beginning in the 1930s) toward the close study of types of instruments, thus paving the way for upward classification (from the late 1960s); 4) a realization (from the 1960s) that existing downward schemes transmitted in literary form are expandable and that their intelligibility can be improved; 5) a shift of focus (from 1990) away from universals to commonalities; 6) a realization (from 1990) that morpho- logical and acoustic characters are most common in classifications used among musicians across the world's music-cultures and sub-cultures; and 7) the fact that, from the late 1960s, the level of communication between scholars has been substantially increasing. Despite these changes throughout the twentieth century, the validity of the comparative method and the conclusions drawn from its application are still limited now, at the turn of the twenty-first century, by our igno- rance of concepts and classifications of instruments devised in many clas- sical, traditional, folk, and popular music-cultures and sub-cultures through- out the world, past and present. Nor have we even begun to gather the data and study the processes and results of change in classifications of instru- ments and ensembles due to diasporas, culture contact, and other causes. Only by finding and thoroughly studying each scheme in its own changing cultural setting can we understand it in its own right, let alone rigorously compare it with other known schemes. Only then will we be in a position to develop a more satisfying and rigorous theory of the classification of musical instruments. Notes 1. I am grateful to Oskir Elschek for suggesting that I write an article on this subject and to David Oldroyd for critically reading an early draft. 2. For further discussion, see Kartomi 1990:114. 3. The shift from a two- to a three-category scheme is found in the theory of sound pre- sented by Nichomachus at the end of the first century CE in his work Enchiridion harmon- ikes (Handbook of Harmonies). See further Kartomi 1990:19. 4. This author prefers to use the original order of names given by the two authors in their joint article-i.e. Hornbostel-Sachs -rather than the Sachs-Hornbostel order used by some other authors. 5. The merits and demerits of the various schemes mentioned above and their relation- ship to the Mahillon/Hornbostel and Sachs system are reviewed in detail in Kartomi 1990:174- 81. For a discussion of Norlind and Izikowitz, see pp. 178-9. None of these schemes, however, found their way into common usage or served to challenge the widespread use of the Horn- bostel and Sachs scheme. 6. Bulletin du Comitd International des Musdes et Collections d'Instruments de Mu- sique (CIMCIM). 7. These schemes and others of the period are discussed in detail in Kartomi 1990:183-</page><page sequence="28">310 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2001 96. Again, none of them found their way into common usage, though several of them were taught in tertiary level organology classes. 8. Hampered by the fact that computers had not yet been developed for general use in the 1940s, Draiger had been unable to complete his project, fulfilling only the morphological part of the classification. 9. The study of European folk instruments such as these had been neglected before World War II, partly because of the attitude that instrumental music was dependent on or a supple- ment to vocal music (Stockmann 1972:11-12). Over a hundred scholars published in series associated with a group of European folk-instrument specialist scholars from the 1960s to the 1980s. Many published in Emsheimer and Stockmann, eds., Handbuch der europaischen Volksn usikinstrumente (1967-86) and the multi-volume series Studia Instrumentorum Musicae Popularis (Emsheimer and Stockmann, eds., 1969-85). Their contribution is of im- portance but is not widely known and understood, partly because their ideas and methodol- ogies are still being developed. It is also partly because the discipline of organology itself offers few guidelines for recognizing and assessing the significance of such contributions. One rea- son why organological classification theory and method have lagged behind parallel develop- ments in biology and other disciplines is that organologists have worked in isolation. 10. Dournon herself contrasts this organological approach with the holistic approach of the theoreticians concerned to develop a schematic model of analysis. In this fundamental aspect her overview of classification systems (some imposed, some culture-emerging) stands in contrast to my own. For I am also drawn to speculations of a theoretical nature, and rumi- nate on why human beings think taxonomically at all. 11. This is an idea developed in ancient systems such as that of the Bassani (Dournon 1992:251). Dournon is not the only scholar to find Schaeffner's system "elegantly logical" (see also Kartomi 1990:174ff). 12. The category of electrophones (or electronophones) was first proposed by Francis Galpin (Galpin 1937:30) and then by Curt Sachs (1940:447-49, 467). Galpin introduced the fifth class of instruments as follows: electronic instruments or electric vibrators, i.e. instru- ments in which the sound-waves are formed by oscillations set up in electric valves. This class, sometimes called electronic, is entirely new and included here for the first time. It is only recently that the familiar "howl" of the oscillating valve has been raised to the dignity of musical expression. Electro-magnetism is also used" (Galpin 1937:30). Jeremy Montagu kindly drew my attention to this reference. Jairazbhoy (1990a:72) is mistaken in attributing this innova- tion to Mantle Hood in 1971 as is his cited reference to Deva (1978:39), who attributes it to N. Bessaraboff in 1941. 13. Le Gonidec suggests that further sub-divisions are needed to distinguish flutes that have more than one tube (e.g. Pan pipes), but according to the morphology of the mouth- piece, not solely according to the presence of a number of tubes. She cites various support- ing, and contrasting, examples. The other category of instruments to receive special consideration in her system is flutes whose resonator is not tubular. In this case she argues that the morphology of the flute body-i.e. whether it be tube- or globe-shaped-is not cru- cial to the classificatory process, since the outer appearance of the instruments does not give any indication about the volume of air nor its acoustical behaviour (Le Gonidec 1997:34). 14. For example, Myer's brass instrument classification scheme could be used in trum- pet and other brass museums, such as at Bad Sickingen (in Germany) and Kremsmiinster (in Austria). 15. It is also possible to use the characters qualitatively to describe the historical devel- opment of instruments such as the trumpet and the trombone (Myers 1998). 16. For a full discussion of the terms and their implications, see Kartomi 1990:12-14. 17. Although the present article is not concerned with reviews of publications, some critical issues arising in review essays are canvassed. 18. Robin Ryan kindly supplied most of the information in this paragraph.</page><page sequence="29">Kartomi: The Classification of Musical Instruments 311 19. I am indebted to Kipps Horn, Ph.D. candidate at Monash University, for the infor- mation contained in this paragraph, part of which derives from his interview with the above- mentioned Lambros Liavis, Director of the Museum for Greek Popular Musical Instruments and the Center for Ethnomusicology in Athens. 20. One can adapt an instrument to its environment, e.g. by tinkering with an organ to make it suit the acoustics of a church, but this is by mechanical, not evolutionary means (David Oldroyd, pers. com. 1999). 21. Most modern biologists have rejected keys. "Identification by means of a key may result in an unsatisfactory, or even ridiculous answer to a classificatory problem because spec- imens in each division of a key need not have anything in common except the chosen char- acter (e.g. if a piano is classed with a shawm because they share the character of being painted black)" (Kartomi 1990:18). Thus keys may actually obscure real relationships. However, as Montagu explains (pers. com.), the technical classificatory term key and the method implied by it can be useful. Classification by keys denotes a process of elimination (i.e. if one's an- swer to a question involving two alternative answers is "yes," go to "x," if "no," go to "y"). As he explains, the key method is useful for curators in museums and narrowly specialized single instrument specialists, such as violin specialists, in auction houses, who know little about instruments as a whole. The method helps such people when they need, for exam- ple, to distinguish an oboe from a clarinet (e.g. it might be asked: is it "conical"? If the an- swer is "yes," go to "oboe," but if the answer is "no, except for the last three inches," then go to "clarinet"). References Adler, Guido. 1885.
