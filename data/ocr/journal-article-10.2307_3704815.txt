CARTER Stanford University Epistemological Ambivalence At least since the enli ghtenment, sex education has been a part ofthe process by which children are guided into adulthood; think, for instance, of the elaborate care with which Rousseau formed Emile's developing passions.1 But it is only in the past hundred years that manda- tory state-sponsored schooling and steadily increasing enrollments of stu? dents past the age of puberty have created the possibility for sexual pedagogy on a mass level. The movement for sex education in the public schools indeed, critic Allan Bloom has argued that one ought to read Books IV and V of Emile as treatises on sex education, the theme which holds together Rousseau's discussions ofthe nature of God and the responsibilities of citizens. In any case, it is clear that Emile makes the transition from childhood to manhood, from dependent pupil to independent citizen, through the process of acquiring knowledge ofthe passions and their place in his universe. Rousseau emphasizes that this is the crux of his whole system of education: if Emile is corrupted by vice or false knowledge derived only from sense experience, the care with which he has been guided up to puberty has all been for nothing. See Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Emile: Or, on Education, Introduction, Commentary, and notes by Allan Bloom (1762; reprint, New York: Basic Books, 1979), esp. Bloom, 15-17; Rousseau, 212, 320. A less theoretical instance of the importance and content of sex education for an En- lightened citizen can be found in the Earl of Chesterfield's advice to his son about how to select a mistress. That gentleman is renowned for advising his adolescent son that, having arrived at an age at which "pleasure is, and ought to be, your business," he would do well to pursue it with "women of health, education, and rank," rather than with prostitutes. The Earl explained that this course of action was more educative and also that the chances of catching the pox were slimmer. See C. Strachey, ed., The Letters ofthe Earl of Chesterfield to His Son, 3d ed., 2 vols. (London: Methuen, 1932), II: 59. This kind of advice is brilliantly contextualized by Roy Porter and Lesley Hall in The Facts ofLife: The Creation of Sexual Knowledge in Britain, 1650-1950 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1995).

Carter began in the second decade ofthe twentieth century, at the cultural mo? ment when vocal public criticism of many social ills was paired with an equally articulate optimism about education's ability to effect their cure. In 1916, Maurice Bigelow, social hygienist and director ofthe School of Practical Arts at Columbia University Teacher's College, commented that "a large number ofthe most enlightened people" had recently turned to education in their search for progress toward the solution of the great sexual problems. This is not surprising to one who is watch- ing the current tendency towards confidence in education. Education has become the modern panacea for many of our ills?hygienic, indus? trial, political, and social.... In every phase of this modern life of ours we are looking to knowledge as the key to all significant problems.2 This essay scrutinizes the characteristically Progressive statement of "con? fidence in education" in the light of sex instructional materials generated in the United States between 1910 and 1940.1 offer detailed readings of a number of such texts, using them to demonstrate that, optimistic rheto? ric notwithstanding, sex education in this country has long roused pro- found ambivalence even among its most ardent supporters.3 It is easy to miss this ambivalence about sexual knowledge because sex educators have exhibited so little ambivalence in their discussions of sexual activity. The chief message of almost all twentieth-century sex education amounts to "Just Say No." Thus, the history of sex education can be seen as the story of shifting strategies aimed at discouraging people from hav? ing sex outside of marriage. This is, for instance, the narrative ofthe most comprehensive historical treatment ofthe subject, Jeffrey Moran's Teach? ing Sex.4 Moran shows that in the early years ofthe century, adults tried to keep adolescents chaste by emphasizing the dangers of venereal disease; around midcentury, classes in "family life" gained popularity, only to be superseded in more recent years by a renewed discussion of disease pre- vention. My purpose here is not to challenge Moran's excellent historical account, though there are points on which we disagree, but to deepen and enrich it by paying closer attention to the texts generated by the move? ment he studies so well. Because he is primarily interested in sex education as a public movement aimed at social control, Moran's work is grounded in activists' and educators' statements about sex education and pays rela? tively little attention to actual classroom materials. Where Moran tells an 2Maurice A.

This approach seems especially appropriate because, as we shall see, early-twentieth-century sex educa- tors were reluctant to speak about sexual acts even in the interest of con? trolling them. Instead, they directed their considerable energies at shaping the epistemological environment within which young people would expe? rience, and act on, sexual desire. Among the most pressing ofthe great sexual problems" for this era, in the minds of many reformers, was the decline in the birth rate among the middle-class, native-born Anglo-Americans who claimed the right to rep- resent the core of national identity and well-being. Since the 1870s, this segment of the population had been losing demographic dominance to the New Immigrants and their offspring. During the same years, the di- vorce rate had been rising steadily. Some late-nineteenth-century observ? ers, such as G. Stanley Hall, interpreted these worrisome facts as manifestations ofthe increasing vice, degeneracy, and selfishness that ur? ban, commercial culture fostered among the white middle classes.5 Oth? ers, like Dr. Edward Clarke, blamed the threat of race suicide on the increasing numbers of middle-class white women who were pursuing some form of higher education. Such critics drew a direct connection between book learning and sexuality, claiming that formal education interfered with women's fertility and femininity, and so made them both biologically and socially unfit for marriage and motherhood.6 However, during the same years a growing number of Americans were beginning to identify a different educational and sexual problem that posed an equally serious threat to marriage and family life. In 1880, Prince Albert Morrow translated Alfred Fournier's Syphilis and Marriage into English, thus inaugurating the American campaign against venereal disease with a ringing declaration that such infections constituted a significant threat to the family. Over the next twenty years, more and more people came to believe that there was a direct connection between venereal disease and the breakdown of marriage. Though reformers continued to declaim against shifting gender roles and social configurations, increasing numbers of people began to argue that the crux of the problem lay in the "enforced igno? rance" about sex that was a prominent component of middle-class cul? ture. The solution was clear: the only way to combat venereal disease, and 5G.

Carter through it the disintegration ofthe family, was "the sane, quiet, complete sex-education ofthe American people."7 In short, increasing concern about the transmission of venereal disease was one ofthe vectors along which modern Americans were drawn into a widespread public conversation about the transmission of sexual knowl? edge. By the end ofthe first decade ofthe twentieth century, sex educa? tion had become a focal point for debates about the condition of the American family, which was commonly assumed to serve as an index to the state ofthe nation. From its earliest days, publicly funded sex educa? tion has emphasized the close connection between individual sexual con? duct and the common weal. As we shall see, pamphlets disseminating sex education to the masses were often fairly explicit in their reminders that every citizen shares in the responsibility to protect the nation by protect- ing home and family from danger?and no citizen can take up that re? sponsibility without first becoming informed. Thus, it is hardly surprising that when faced with the apparent disintegration of the family unit that had long been theorized as the political and spiritual foundation of the Republic, many Americans placed their hopes in sex education. Access to sexual knowledge was, then, the solution to the significant problem ofthe future ofthe American family. But not all sexual knowledges were equally benign. Many people feared that information and beliefs de- rived from vulgar or commercial sources might be inaccurate, or might encourage promiscuity. Education's power meant that it could befiiddle or corrupt, as well as enlighten. For this reason, even the most enthusias- tic sex educators expressed definite reservations about the transmission of sexual knowledge, agreeing that there were both "dangers and advantages [in] sex instruction for children."8 The chief danger was always presumed to be that sexual knowledge would somehow transform itself into sexual activity. Fearful of such a transformation of thought into action, early- twentieth-century pedagogues and parents thought and wrote extensively about how to give children the necessary information while guaranteeing that sex would remain squarely in the epistemological realm. Yet the very transformative power over conduct that made sexual knowledge risky also made it necessary if the next generation was successfully to solve "the great sexual problems." Caught between the desire to shape sexual activity and the fear of stimu? lating it, between the wish to enforce some forms of sexuality and the dread of accidentally fostering others, sex education occupied an uncomfortably 7Robert N.

Early-twentieth-century sex educators re- sponded to that ambivalence by trying to codify and control the produc? tion and dissemination of knowledge. That is, epistemological ambivalence shaped pedagogical strategy; therefore, we can read backward from the pedagogical materials that have survived the century to reconstruct the epis? temological context in which they were conceived. The sources on which this article is based?including sex educators' published discussions with one another, syllabuses from sex-education classes, books and pamphlets used in schools and homes, and popular commentary on such materials? are, I suggest, best understood as contributions to an ongoing conversation about how to balance the social dangers of sexual ignorance, on the one hand, and sexual knowledge on the other. To interpret these texts in this fashion is to take a deliberately literary approach to my sources. This seems appropriate in part because the sources I find most compelling?the stories actually put into children's hands as sources of trustworthy sexual knowledge?are in many ways dubious his? torical documents. Like other prescriptive literature, sex-instruction mate? rials offer only very problematic information about what people actually did.9 Perhaps for that reason, sex-education materials have not been sub- jected to sustained scholarly scrutiny.10 In contrast, this article places such sex-instructional materials at center stage. I read these books and pam? phlets as articulations of a vibrant national conversation that both consti? tuted and responded to the dominant sexual culture of their time and place. "Sex guides" themselves were not articulate about the process of their own production, preferring instead to present their contents as unmediated reflections of human sexual nature. But, like the professional literature of social hygiene and education, they were often explicit about sex education's goals, and about the larger discursive climate that made such education essential. As Moran has shown, sex instruction's primary aim was simply to keep people from having sex until they were married. Sex educators and reformers tried to achieve this end by altering the terms in which ordinary men and women, boys and girls, thought about sex?that is, they attempted to intervene in sexual discourse, deauthorizing the popular beliefs about 9The classic article on the difference between prescriptive literature and lived behavior is Carl Degler, "What Ought to Be and What Was: Women's Sexuality in the Nineteenth Century," in The American Family in Social-Historical Perspective, ed. Michael Gordon (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1978). 10The few secondary works addressing these sources often treat them as quaint relics of an unenlightened past. Patricia Campbell's Sex Guides: Books and Films about Sexuality for Toung Adults (New York: Garland Publishing, 1986) is an exception, providing a useful chronology of publication and some insightful observations, but it makes no claim to being a work of detailed scholarly criticism.

Carter sexuality that they identified as clearly detrimental to American morality, marriage, and family life. Among the many beliefs about sex that Progressive Era activists set out to dispel, two superstitions were repeatedly described in instructional materials for young people as especially widespread and pernicious. These were the "doctrine of necessity," or the belief that sex was necessary for men's health, and the belief that gonorrhea was "no worse than a bad cold."11 The "doctrine of necessity" held that regular sexual intercourse was a biological requirement for men. This doctrine constituted a direct attack on pure family life in that it justified patronage of prostitutes, pro- miscuity, and adultery, and therefore contributed to the spread of venereal disease. In turn, the belief that venereal disease was not particularly harm- ful discouraged infected people from seeking medical treatment or re- fraining from sex after the initial, uncomfortable symptoms passed. In place of these dangerous and inaccurate beliefs, early-twentieth-cen- tury sex education offered the citizenry access to the "scientific truth" of sex.12 As we shall see, this included two distinct but related bodies of knowl? edge. The first "scientific truth" offered by sex education was knowledge about the seriousness of venereal infection and the damage it wreaked in individual lives, in families, and in American society at large. This knowl? edge of contagion was a direct attack on the "no worse than a bad cold" theory of venereal disease. The second "scientific truth" answered the doctrine of sexual necessity with a counter-doctrine of sexual exclusivity as biologically normal for human beings. This counter-doctrine, which I call the knowledge of development, struck at the doctrine of necessity by teach? ing that eons of development in reproductive methods had culminated in monogamous, loving marriage and parenthood. As indicated above, the knowledge of contagion was the focus ofthe earliest concerted efforts to introduce sex education to the nation at large, while the knowledge of development achieved its greatest popularity be? tween 1925 and 1940. Yet, while developmental education supplanted the knowledge of contagion in cutting-edge pedagogical theory and in some schools and communities, both strands of thought were reflected in educational materials widely available throughout the period under study 1'Margaret Sanger, What Every Girl Should Know (1920; reprint, New York: Belvedere Publishing, 1980), 60; Andrew C.

Although that contest was sometimes bitter, the two schools of sex-educational thought were allies against a common enemy: the popular, commercial, pleasure-seeking sexu? ality that flourished in this era.14 All sex educators shared the dream that, if properly instructed, the next generation would triumph over vice, dis? ease, unhappiness, and divorce. Free from venereal disease and secure in the knowledge that ages of evolutionary growth culminated in their mar? riage beds, their sex would be wholesome, their relationships fruitful, and their children conceived without shame. However, this vision of enlightened sexuality was always accompanied by the fear that an education about sex might in and of itself constitute an encouragement to licentiousness. As we shall see, the knowledge of con- tagion was highly controversial, in large part because it required open discussion of prostitution, adultery, and prophylactic methods. Many people feared that these discussions would themselves prove contagious, con- taminating the minds and morals ofthe young. The knowledge of devel? opment drew comparatively mild criticism, chiefly, I suggest, because developmental education's focus on "the birds and the bees" allowed it to evade direct engagement with human sexuality. Each ofthe major strands of sex education, then, sought to reconcile the ambivalence at its heart by trying to teach sex without inadvertently introducing students to desire, hoping that education could influence behavior but that both knowledge and its consequences could be controlled and contained. 13For instance, developmental knowledges form the core of influential early texts like Maurice Bigelow's Sex Education: A Series ofLectures concerning Knowledge of Sex in Its Relation to Human Life (1916; reprint, New York: Macmillan, 1918), while in Teaching Sex, Moran shows that during the Depression, venereal-disease education had more fund? ing than any other branch of sex education (pp. 113-16). Since that funding was distrib- uted through state boards of health, who were primary distributors of sex-information pamphlets, it seems plain that the knowledge of contagion continued to be widely dissemi- nated even before the Second World War encouraged renewed emphasis on disease control among the troops. Therefore, though the knowledge of contagion dominated the 1910s and the knowledge of development gained visibility during the 1920s, the two approaches to sex education coexisted and were in conversation with one another throughout the pe? riod under study here. 14One aspect ofthe culture against which sex educators wrote is beautifully delineated in George Chauncey, Gay New Tork: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making ofthe Gay Male World, 1890-1940 (New York: Basic Books, 1994); see also Sharon Ullman, "'The Twenti- eth-Century Way': Female Impersonation and Sexual Practice in Turn-of-the-Century America," Journal ofthe History of Sexuality 5 (4): 573-600 (1995).

Carter The Knowledge of Contagion The movement for education to combat syphilis and gonorrhea had its roots in the anti-prostitution campaigns ofthe 1880s and 1890s, when social-purity activists targeted the double standard of morality and com? mercial sex as among the chief contaminants ofthe home by the forces of sin.15 In the social-purity perspective described by historians David Pivar and Barbara Epstein, men who frequented saloons and brothels wasted the money and manhood that morally "belonged" to their wives and children. In spending themselves on drink and loose women, they not only robbed their families of financial and emotional security but de- graded the entire female sex as well.16 This metaphorical contagion, in which pure women and pure homes were smirched by men's contact with prosti? tutes and disorderly houses, was accompanied by a more literal kind. When men came home with empty pockets, inflamed passions, drained energies, and damaged morals, they also brought venereal disease. Even before American entry into the First World War made military metaphors ubiquitous, exhortations against vice and contagion sometimes drew on the language of holy crusades. For instance, in 1914 the president ofthe newly formed American Social Hygiene Association described vene? real diseases as "doubtless the very worst foes of sound family life, and thence of civilization."17 But as Allan Brandt has shown, social-hygiene ac? tivism gained momentum, and its first mass audience, in the context ofthe United States' extensive military activities of 1916 through 1918.18 Mobi- lization drew reformers' attention to the moral and hygienic environment of army life. Predictably, they were horrified at what they found: camps encircled by saloons and houses of prostitution, official tolerance of the "cribs," and correspondingly high rates of venereal disease. Partly in re? sponse to reformers' reports, the Secretary of War formed the Commission on Training Camp Activities (CTCA) less than two weeks after the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917. The CTCA offered soldiers a variety of recreational and religious activities as well as mandatory sex education, all of which were designed to encourage sexual continence 15Irving Kassoy, "A History ofthe Work ofthe American Social Hygiene Association in Sex Education, 1876-1930" (master's thesis, M.S.

Lessons in continence were intended both to reduce infection rates and to inculcate the sexual self-control and moral fiber char- acteristic of good men, good soldiers, and good citizens.19 The discursive connection between chastity, manliness, and military strength is clear in the military policy of classifying venereal infections as injuries inflicted "not in the line of duty"?which is to say, as the moral and practical equivalent of shooting oneself in the foot to avoid active service, and therefore subject to court-martial.20 While the law governing civilians did not have the power to punish those contracting venereal infections, extramilitary sex education for boys shared many of the assumptions and rhetorical strategies prominent in CTCA-sponsored instruction. From about 1910 on, most pamphlets and books for boys combined some explicit information about the medical consequences of contracting a venereal disease with emphatic messages about the social ravages that syphilis and gonorrhea wrought. The chief difference between the two bodies of literature appears to have been that the literature for soldiers in the Great War typically emphasized the extent to which venereal infections made one's comrades bear the burden of one's moral weakness, while the literature for civilians tended instead to focus on the danger of infecting women and children. In both cases, what made venereal disease so utterly dishonorable was its ability to attack "the inno? cent," that is, people who had not themselves engaged in acts of venery. Brandt has shown that CTCA literature sometimes depicted prostitutes as an enemy analogous to German troops in terms ofthe threat they posed to the vigor of American manhood and the health ofthe nation's families and homes.21 In civilian contexts, propriety dictated that prostitutes must not be depicted in the graphic, matter-of-fact manner that seemed appro? priate in talks to enlisted men. Therefore, prostitutes' rhetorical position as sources of infection was transmuted into vague personifications of ve? nereal disease as a traitor or spy who destroyed families by insinuating itself into the intimacy between spouses. One pamphlet called venereal disease "a most sinister intruder," whose subtle influence could "abso- lutely wreck every hope of conjugal felicity."22 Another writer warned that the convention of polite silence about the venereal threat made the "fatal treachery of gonorrhea" much easier. Just as public exposure rendered political traitors powerless, public education undermined venereal disease's power to attack the home.23 19Brandt, 62. 20Brandt observes this in a caption in his first unpaginated section of illustrations. 21Brandt, 66. 22Thurman B.

Carter In civilian sex education, the metaphor of treachery conflated the pro? tection ofthe family (through continence) with the protection ofthe na? tion (at arms). This conflation underscores the extent to which many early-twentieth-century Americans believed that ideal masculinity required bearing the burden of responsibility for the weaker members of society. It also highlights the importance of sex education: knowledge was the weapon a virile man could use to protect "innocent wives," "newborn infants," and the nation itself from the venereal threat. Thus we can see that the knowledge of contagion drew on, and participated in constructing, quite conservative ideals of gender in its attempt to enlist the entire nation in an educational war against venereal disease. To a certain extent, declarations about masculinity permitted reformers to warn boys away from vice and venereal disease without requiring them to go into detail about prosti? tutes or intercourse. Sex education for boys and young men asserted that true manliness lay in resisting desire, and especially in resisting the treach- erous lures of commercial vice. Most such works emphasize that only a weakling, a cad, or a fool would visit a prostitute and, thus, become the means by which his home was conquered by sickness, his wife and chil? dren maimed or killed: "He is but a coward who does not shrink from buying voluptuous moments with the hazard of wife and child."24 One popular 1914 sex-instruction manual capped its description ofthe dam- ages wrought by gonorrhea by inviting its readers to imagine a tiny grave with a tombstone reading: Here lies a little blind baby, so afflicted from birth, offered up by its father as a sacrifice to his pre-marriage sacrilege ofthe sexual relation. The young reader was offered a choice between being "the murderer ofhis own child" and being "a real man!"25 A similar work from 1916 empha? sized the martial prowess "real" manhood required. Resisting the urge to indulge in premarital intercourse was the only way a man could be sure he was free of all venereal infection upon his marriage. This resistance was "the biggest fight ever waged by man?a fight in secret?without applause."26 24Sisson, 101. See also Sisson, 102; Harry H. Moore, "Teaching Phases: For Boys," in The Social Emergency: Studies in Sex Hygiene and Morals, ed. William T. Foster (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1914), 152. Patricia Campbell has named this kind of sex-education literature the "bully boys" school of thought, a phrase that nicely captures the Rooseveltian flavor ofthe books' exhortations to live cleanly and strenuously.

As one educator explained in 1911, "The appeal to normal healthy motherhood is all-sufficient with girls and . . . if only they are given the precautions and relations correctly they will strictly avoid anything which is likely to endanger this function."27 "Anything," of course, meant premarital or extramarital sex. It also included marriage to men who had not had the patriotic fortitude necessary to stay chaste. One of Margaret Sanger's pamphlets aimed at working-class women included a richly descriptive anecdote about a twenty-five-year-old whose husband had had gonorrhea before their marriage: The doctor found her flowing excessively, the cervix badly torn, the uterus sharply bent back and fixed, ovaries bound down and adher- ent, the tubes thickened; a leuchorreal discharge was present which contained gonococci, and other symptoms which made her sick and miserable. The doctor operated upon her, scraping the womb, sewing the torn cervix, opening the abdomen to remove the thickened ap- pendix and inflamed ovaries and tubes. She convalesced beautifully, and had no bad or unusual symptoms for six months, at which time she returned with a renewed infection. Careful questioning extracted from the husband the confession that he had been "out with the boys," and had had a recurrence of gonorrhea.28 Though it seems unlikely that most readers would have been able to picture the exact organs and conditions named in this passage, the general point is clear. This young woman was one of "the innocent" whose body was the battleground between purity and disease. She suffered because, without ac? cess to the knowledge of contagion in her maidenhood, she had had no way to know what her choice of husband would mean for her health and happi? ness; similarly, she had no way to protect herself against reinfection.29 Her ignorance was compounded by her husband's failure to protect her against disease, and as a result, invasive surgery rendered her sterile. Venereal disease had won this round ofthe war over "sound family life." To the extent that motherhood was an essential component of femininity, venereal disease also succeeded in undermining her gender. Like her counterparts in sex educa? tion for boys, Sanger managed to convey that purity was essential for "real women" without once mentioning exactly what that roving husband did when he was "out with the boys."

Carter tragedy of maternal capacities wasted, here stand in for explicit information about prostitution and sexual intercourse. In sum, the knowledge of contagion presented itself as an absolutely necessary element of the strategy that would make the world safe not only for democracy, but for the marriages, homes, and families in which democracy was born and nurtured. This connection was sometimes ex? plicit. For instance, a pamphlet put out by the United States Public Health Service quoted the Surgeon General as saying that venereal disease was "the greatest cause of disability in military life"; then, the pamphlet en- listed civilians of both sexes in the fight against venereal disease by ex- plaining that "the diseases, being highly contagious, have entered homes and marriage relations. . . . [T]hese diseases form a public health prob? lem for civilians to solve in peace as well as in war." After appealing to the urge to protect "innocent young wives" and babies from a variety of medical horrors, the pamphlet expanded its rhetoric from home protec? tion to patriotic appeal: "No army and no nation can attain to its full vigor when its young men are weakened by venereal disease, when its women are barren, and when its children are defective."30 The "test of war" proved that ignorance about sex rendered young American men and women vulnerable and offered the enemy?whether germ or Ger? man?an advantage.31 The knowledge of contagion was a strong armor in purity's arsenal, and increasing numbers of public-school sex educa? tors stood ready to buckle it on. "How Shall We Teach?": Containing Contagious Knowledges Yet for all its rhetorical potency, the "educational attack" in the war to pro? tect the family against venereal disease faced a major difficulty in that a clear understanding ofthe danger required public reference to illicit sexual activi? ties.32 Delicate displacements of sexual matters onto discussions of gender did not conceal the fact that the knowledge of contagion necessarily in? cluded related knowledges of adultery, prostitution, and medical pathology. In consequence, many people recoiled from the suggestion of venereal edu? cation, believing it to be but one short step from actual viciousness. Even the president ofthe American Social Hygiene Association warned that the attack 30California State Board of Health (CSBH) pamphlet no. 15, "The Problem of Sex Education in Schools," 3.

In 1913 John Sheppard, a Jersey City clergyman, declared that Just at present our ears are dinned with the fad of sex hygiene. Its introduction into the schools is discussed throughout the country. If ever there was a system diabolically devised to injure our youth, and to make them voluptuaries, this is by far the most effective.36 The rhetoric of war against infection that served sex educators also served their opponents. Sheppard's comment was probably a reference to the very public battle in Chicago in 1913. Jeffrey Moran has explained that in that year, Elia Flagg Young used her position as superintendent of schools to introduce a system-wide sex-education program in the Chicago secondary schools, arguing that "sex hygiene" lectures would help to protect the city's youth from the dangers of vice. Although Young had considerable support for her "Chicago Experiment," which was backed by such influential fig? ures as Jane Addams, the lectures were canceled after one semester in re? sponse to intense disapproval from the (nonexpert but articulate) public and the city government. In Chicago and around the country, opposition to sex education in public schools focused on the possibility that knowl? edge about sexual physiology, reproduction, and disease would corrupt the morals of youth, either directly or by arousing curiosity and encouraging experimentation. Other opponents of Young's program argued that sex in- struction was a part of character training and moral education and as such was the province of home and church, rather than ofthe public schools.37 33C.

Carter But while Young's attempt to institutionalize sex hygiene education on a system-wide level was a magnet for outrage, increasing numbers of indi? vidual high school principals were offering sex education without official permission from their boards of education. By 1920, fully 40 percent ofthe high schools responding to a federal survey claimed to be offering some sort of sex education, though the majority of this education was admittedly of an improvised and limited type, usually covering no more than simple information about the physiology of puberty, conception, and the dangers of venereal infection. Only 15.5 percent ofthe schools reported that they had "integrated" sex education into the curriculum "so as to guide conduct and develop sound understandings, attitudes and ideals."38 Though "inte? grated" sex education was still a rarity, the trend of change was clear. In 1922, the Winnetka, Illinois, school system succeeded with a sex education considerably more comprehensive than the one that had failed in Chicago, by making "family life education" a requirement for graduation.39 By 1927, 45 percent of American high schools were offering sex education, and fully 29 percent of these had developed integrated programs addressing issues of "personal and social adjustment . . . [and] character and mental health as well as physical health."40 The intense opposition to sex education in public schools peaked be? tween 1913 and 1918, after which date those who disliked or disapproved of it grew relatively quiet about their position.41 There was no single and decisive victory for the forces of social hygiene to help account for this change. There is some evidence that the public simply tired of outrage about venereal disease and education about it, and instead turned its attention to the increasing visibility of sex in public culture. In 1930, a statistical study often leading "journals of opinion" noted that from 1914 to 1916, "Social Vice and Prostitution" was a favored topic of articles and editorials, while 38Benjamin C.

Out of several hundred letters from superintendents of schools, responding to Gruenberg's request for suggestions as he revised High Schools and Sex Education (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1939) for its third edition, only four were opposed to sex education. Several more were doing nothing in their schools but stated no articulate opposition.</page><page sequence="15">Toward an Intellectual History ofSex Education 227 from 1917 to 1922, more attention was given to "Sex Morality (Immodest Dancing and Dress)."42 This shift of focus for public outrage, from prosti? tution and venereal disease to "immodesty," may have helped render sex education less controversial. The difference seems to have been that, while vice and immodesty were both sources of contamination, knowledge about sexual vice and disease was more morally dangerous than information about current fashions. People who opposed sex-hygiene education sometimes did so because they feared that an education about sickness and vice could easily become an education in sickness and vice.43 Even those who otherwise supported sex education expressed reservations about teaching children about pathol- ogy. They worried that youth exposed to too much knowledge about the prevalence of venereal disease, vice, and unhappiness in marriage might become cynical, viewing sex as degrading, dangerous, and dirty.44 Such concerns had some basis in fact. As they fought the "no worse than a bad cold" superstition with the knowledge of contagion, sex educators some? times implanted a new superstition about the dangers of sex. Especially 42Hubert Charles Newland, The Change in Attitude towards Sex Freedom as Disclosed by American Journals of Opinion during the Tears 1911 to 1930 (Chicago: private edition dis- tributed by the University of Chicago Libraries, 1935), 4. The journals surveyed for this generalization were selected "on the advice of two city librarians" as reflecting "the attitude ofthe person of average intelligence, education, and socio-economic status" (p. 2). 43For instance, one Philadelphia newspaper argued that sex-hygiene instruction amounted to "Teaching Vice to Little Children."

See also Moran, "Modernism Gone Mad," 502-5. ^This is, of course, a rephrasing of the standard argument that contact with vice had a hardening effect on the morals and sensibilities. It was platitudinous to state that a positive emphasis encouraged purity. In 1924, M. A. Bigelow included this among "The Established Points in Social Hygiene Education, 1905-1924," writing: "It is established beyond ques? tion that abnormality and immorality in sexual lines should not be stressed when teaching young people. Rather should there be emphasis on the moral, the normal, the healthful, the helpful, and the esthetic aspects ofthe sexual processes in human life. Extensive knowledge of vice or sexual aberrancy is not helpful to any individual who is not a specialist in the medical or legal phases of social hygiene" (Journal of Social Hygiene 10 [1]: 9 [January 1924]). The belief that pathological knowledge was contagious led to the widely held tenet that most doctors were unsuitable sex educators. For instance, the CSBH pamphlet, Problem of Sex Education in Schools, 11, included the statement that if physicians were hired to give "emer- gency teaching" (e.g., lectures on sex hygiene such as Elia Flagg Young proposed), they "must be warned against too much emphasis on the abnormal cases with which they daily come into contact." At least one high school principal believed that the Chicago Experiment failed because Young brought doctors into the schools for special lectures, a move guaran- teed to arouse opposition (James Peabody, cited in Maw, 86). An editorial in the Journal of Education 75: 313-33 (March 21, 1912), presented a summary of its readers' responses to a sex education survey that included the statement "Physicians . . . should not do it alone, but in company with others. Their interests are too pathological."</page><page sequence="16">228 Julian B. Carter before the mid-1920s, the knowledge of contagion made a strong appeal to the emotions of fear and disgust. It was apparently not unusual for sex- hygiene lecturers, determined to impress the seriousness of venereal dis? ease on their young audiences, to distress pupils to the point that they threw up or fainted.45 Some sex educators emphasized the danger of con? tagion to a degree that suggested any contact with another person could be fatal. For instance, the 1913 edition of Dr. Mary Wood-Allen's popular What a Toung Woman Ought to Know concludes its description of syphilis with a three-page passage on contamination: The first unchaste connection of a man with a woman may be at? tended with a contamination entailing upon him a life of suffering, and even death itself. Almost imperceptible in its origin, it corrupts the whole body, makes the very air offensive to surrounding friends, and lays multitudes literally to rot in the grave. It commences in one part ofthe body, and usually, in more or less degree, extends to the whole system, and is said by most eminent physicians to be a morbid poison, having the power of extending itself to every part ofthe body into which it is infused, and to other persons with whom it in any way comes in contact, so that even its moisture, communicated by linen or otherwise, may corrupt those who unfortunately touch it. . . . Not one, but many girls who have held somewhat lax ideas concerning the propriety of allowing young men to be familiar have reaped the result in a contamination merely through the touch ofthe lips.46 This and similar passages in other works are sufficiently vague about the specifics of infection that they are more accurately described as sources for the fear of contagion than as sources of knowledge. It is possible to read this passage as suggesting that syphilis can be caught by contact with the air near an infected person. Similarly, if a young person had hazy ideas about exactly what "connection" involved, the passage could be read as meaning that unchastity itself was the "contamination" rather than the means of its transmission. One young woman at Columbia University Teachers' College, who may have read some such description, knew that syphilis could be transmitted by kissing but did not realize that one ofthe 45de Schweinitz, "Dangers and Advantages," 561-62. He mentions such fearsome sex education as common "a few years ago," that is, in the 1920s. One army lecturer during the First World War was proud of his ability to frighten the troops with ghastly photographs and stories until they were, as he wrote to his superior, "virtually as pliable as putty." This was apparently consistent with military policy, which held that "the fear of disease forms the backbone of practically every preventive medicine educational campaign."

She asked her teacher, "How is the disease called siflis caught by two perfectly clean people kissing? i.e., by 'contraction?'"47 Such confusions are more understandable when one re- members that a central motive for offering the knowledge of contagion was to promote chastity. This student had the details of transmission wrong, but she had heard the underlying message clearly?don't touch. The knowledge of contagion, though intended to combat vice and dis? ease, found itself implicated in a new superstition of contamination that many people believed was equally effective in preventing healthy, happy marriage. Just as venereal disease attacked home and family, the knowledge of contagion could drive a wedge between men and women. In 1914 a widely respected sex-education columnist for the Ladies' Home Journal wrote that her fan mail included letters from young girls who were "so afraid of young men, since hearing ofthe dangers that exist for girls, that they can hardly speak to them."48Trying to prevent this kind of reaction, a biology professor at Clark University argued that girls should be "shielded" from "too specific knowledge ofthe abnormal side for fear of morbid tendencies, shock, or arrests in normal development." Such comments hint at a fear that the knowledge of contagion could undermine heterosexual romance, possi- bly driving girls into a life of celibacy or lesbianism. No such fear hindered educators in their dealings with boys; the Clark biology professor believed that boys should have "the side of disease painted truthfully." Nevertheless, moderation was desirable with boys as well as with girls. The professor went on to add that a truthful account of venereal disease "needs no exaggeration to constitute . . . a most effective safeguard against taking any risk of infec- tion."49 The pedagogical problem was how to instill a wholesome fear of sufficient strength to ensure prenuptial chastity, without seeming to support an unwholesome perspective on sex as vile and dirty. The dangers had to be drawn clearly, yet in a way that would appeal to youthful idealism about sex and marriage rather than undermine it. The problem of how to contain potentially contagious knowledges helps to explain the disturbing frequency with which sex-educational material for adolescents described the impact of venereal disease on infants.50 Asking 47Davenport, 186. 48Rose Wood-Allen Chapman, In Her Teens (New York: Revell, 1914).

Carter young men and women to imagine the brief and painful lives of babies born with syphilis or gonorrhea was one strategy for scaring adolescents into chastity while still keeping the hope for healthy parenthood present in their minds.51 The knowledge of prenatal contagion was intended not only to frighten teenagers, but also to call out and develop their nascent parental urges to cherish and care for children. Purity in the service ofthe coming generation was morally and socially superior to purity only out of fear. As one writer put it, "The lad who is 'good' merely for the sake of his own skin is a poor creature; the finest lad?who might perhaps hazard his own indi? vidual fate?will refuse to gamble with the souls and bodies of those others who shall be his own flesh and blood."52 This perspective seems to have guided the decision to include a photo- graph of a syphilitic baby in Irving Steinhardt's manuals Ten Sex Talks to Girls (1913) and Ten Sex Talks to Boys (1914). In the manual for girls, the photograph appeared in the middle of a long passage addressing and sym- pathizing with the infant depicted there: "Poor little syphilitic baby! No one loves you nor wants to hug and kiss you except, perhaps, the poor mother who had the misfortune to bring you into the world."53 The pho? tograph makes the reason plain (see fig. 1). The infant's skin is badly dis- colored, cracked, and apparently sloughing off; its mouth gapes and is crusted with diseased tissue, and, just at the limit ofthe camera's focus, its eyes wear the fixed and unnerving stare of death. The image is the more disturbing in that at first glance the baby seems terribly distorted, its feet almost as large as its head and too close to it. A second look reveals that the picture is actually two photographs, one of the head and one of the feet, juxtaposed on the page in a way that heightens the horror of the composite image while it discreetly avoids showing the infant's genitals. The image of the syphilitic baby represents disease with excessive clarity, while it crops all other obvious information about sex out ofthe picture. Yet to Steinhardt, the syphilitic baby offered a model not only of sick- ness, but of selflessness and social service.

Carter suffering in their own children. Nonetheless, many people criticized the knowledge of contagion on the grounds that an education that featured these repellent details was a real threat to the family life it sought to de- fend. The knowledge of contagion made itself yet more unpopular by taking a tone of uncompromising moral superiority. One such writer ar? gued that "to object to this instruction because it is gruesome, or because it may seem like intimidation, is sentimentalism; in this matter, as else- where in the realm of knowledge, the truth should scare no one who does not need to be scared. It is better to be safe than sorry; and it is better to be scared than syphilitic."55 Another added that he "did not know ofa single scientific fact that [could] harm a child."56 This combination of gruesome detail and stubborn inflexibility about its value was common in nineteenth-century exposes of shameful social conditions. Karen Halttunen has argued that graphic depictions of suffer? ing in reformist literature reflected a Romantic fascination with vicarious sensations. An important strand of nineteenth-century humanitarian thought held that exposure to others' suffering inspired the feeling of sympathy for one's fellow men [sic]; this experience allegedly uplifted and enlightened the viewer. More important still, sympathetic suffering was supposed to strengthen the viewer's commitment to fighting the causes of the depicted agony.57 But this belief had come under fire by the early twentieth century. To many moderns, its basic premise of inspiring pain, even if only on an imaginary level, was cruel. Insisting on the value of sympathetic suffering made the proponents of the knowledge of conta? gion seem like ghoulish misanthropes, out to terrify youth for their own good. In this new context, the old style of humanitarian exhortation lent credibility to the opponents of sex education, who did not care for the interesting pathos of dead babies but did care about the images in living adolescents' minds. Such opponents were joined by supporters ofa differ? ent, more inspiring kind of sex education, who argued that the knowledge of contagion was itself a threat to morals and damaging to youth. To such critics, when sex instruction became scare instruction, it ceased to battle superstition and began to retail it instead: "In many cases the horrors of [the venereal] diseases have been so overemphasized that susceptible boys have developed a morbid anxiety about possible innocent infections, and some girls a horror of all males as bearers of these dreadful maladies."58 55Sisson, 101. 56Ralph E.

The knowledge of contagion represented sex as a pollutant and a moral scourge, at the same moment that it argued for its value as the foundation for happy marriages and a healthy civilization. One widespread response to this uncomfortable epis- temological situation was to try to resolve it by suppressing venereological information. By 1919, a general consensus began to emerge that too much emphasis on disease was poor preparation for healthy adult sexuality, and called for education about "the moral, the normal, the healthful, the help? ful, and the esthetic aspects" of sex.60 As a result, by 1925 teaching about venereal disease was no longer at the vital center of sex education, though it remained in circulation.61 It was around this time that sex-education materials began to use variants ofthe phrase "the facts of life" as a euphe- mism for sexual knowledge. The emergence of this new vocabulary sug? gests the extent to which the knowledge of contagion had come to be seen as "the facts of death." The Knowledge of Development While the knowledge of contagion emphasized the symptomatic morbidity of a corrupted sexual nature, the knowledge of development offered a vi? sion of sex as a part of a lively and wholesome natural world. The knowledge of development, like the knowledge of contagion, had its critics. When its evolutionary intellectual thrust was explicit, Catholics and fundamentalist 59Davenport, 237-38. 60Maurice A. Bigelow, "Established Points," 9. See also Kassoy, 95. It is possible that the shift away from the knowledge of contagion was influenced by professional educators' fears that their pure and scientific lessons might be confused with a new form of vulgar, commercial sex education: the "sex hygiene" films produced and (widely) distributed by small independent companies. These films were intentionally sensational in all the ways sex education tried not to be; some of them used the threat of venereal disease as an excuse for titillating depictions of fast women, and all of them did their best to stimulate visceral, rather than rational, response from audience members. See Eric Schaefer, "Bold! Daring! Shocking! True!v: A History of Exploitation Films, 1919-1959 (Durham, NC: Duke Univer? sity Press, 1999). 61For instance, Steinhardt's Ten Sex Talks volumes were reprinted into the 1940s. Also, in 1938 Surgeon General Thomas Parran instituted a fresh wave of hysteria about the vene? real epidemic (see Brandt, No Magic Bullet). Despite the new availability of federal funds for venereal-disease education, there does not seem to have been a wave of publication of new classroom materials about venereal disease. One reason is that the educational and medical wings of the sex-education movement had moved apart from one another before this date; see Moran, Teaching Sex, 56.</page><page sequence="22">234 Julian B. Carter Protestants sometimes opposed it as a moral contaminant. Yet the knowl? edge of development became the foundation of sex education for several decades, structuring innumerable syllabuses and the contents of many widely distributed pamphlets and books. Part of its success can be attributed to the fact that the knowledge of development was inspiring and uplifting. Developmental education presented sex as a marvelous, powerful force of nature, to be admired and respected as one admired and respected Yellowstone's geysers or Niagara Falls. Like other natural beauties and re- sources, sex could be damaged or wasted by the ignorant, and so people must be taught not to exploit its powers and pleasures thoughtlessly. Thus, the knowledge of development endeared itself to many people by uphold- ing a conservationist morality that preached chaste self-restraint.62 It coun- tered the "doctrine of necessity" yet avoided mentioning prostitution or promiscuity; instead of discussing vice, evolutionary education retailed the belief that monogamy was biologically natural for human beings. In addition, the knowledge of development interpreted sex primarily as the process of procreation and the foundation of the family. This focus satisfied even the jumpiest sexual conservatives as it invited parents to par- ticipate in sex education, offering them a position of authority about the "facts of life" in a way that the knowledge of contagion had failed to do. Finally, the popularized evolutionary model of development at work in this kind of sex education provided excellent theoretical justifications for avoid- ing any explicit discussion of human sexuality with young people. In all these ways, the knowledge of development contained the epistemological ambivalence at the heart of sex education, and in so doing rendered itself sufficiently uncontroversial to dominate the field for some time. Yet that ambivalence remained present within its lessons and can be seen clearly in its convoluted and elaborately metaphorical approach to the sexual desire and activity necessary for human reproduction and family life. The developmental approach to sex education is well illustrated by Karl de Schweinitz's 1928 Growing Up: The Story ofHow We Become Alive, Are Born, and Grow Up. This little book went through eight printings in its first sixteen months and continued to sell briskly for many years in several edi? tions; it was probably the single most widely read sex-education source of 62Moore's Keeping in Condition was explicit about the relationship between conserving natural resources and conserving sex: "ln earlier times it was assumed that there was in the United States an inexhaustible supply of timber, coal, metals, and other forms of natural wealth, and for years millions of dollars' worth of these resources were wasted. Now it is realized that this wealth is limited, and any waste in its use is condemned. The conservation movement is a protest against waste, and is based on the idea of saving for future use. . . . It is much more important to conserve the great vital forces in human life. . . . Those things [i.e., sexual acts] which waste the strength and energies of youth are to be regarded as much greater dangers to the welfare of the nation than business activities which endanger our forests, soil, mines and water power" (p. 6). 63Campbell, 84.</page><page sequence="23">Toward an Intellectual History ofSex Education 235 the interwar years.63 As de Schweinitz's title signals, in the developmental point of view "sex" was dynamic, neither a single fact of genital difference nor an act of coupling. Instead, "sex" was primarily a force (stimulating growth) and a process (of development, as in "growing up"). The "sexual act" here appeared only in passing, as the link between the end of the pa- rental cycle of sexual development and the beginning of the next generation's story.64 This expansive, yet evasive, understanding of "sex" was one of the hallmarks of developmental sex education. It drew on the lan? guage of evolutionary theory to explain that individual children recapitu- lated the development of the species; the stages through which children passed before they reached sexual adulthood reflected the sexual history of their remote ancestors.65 In concert with this recapitulatory perspective, as we shall see, evolu? tionary sex education was graded in the effort to make it correspond to the stage of development reached. Some sexual knowledge, such as "where the baby came from," was appropriate for quite small children. Other knowledges were given later.66 The important point is that such education was developmental in its emphasis on successive stages: it taught sex as a process of growth through which the species had passed and through which individual children became capable of perpetuating their kind. Further- more, the recapitulatory schedule enabled developmental sex education to justify avoiding discussion of eroticism and sexual activity on the grounds 64For sex as the force behind physical maturation, see Rice, In Training, 11; as the process of development, Max J. Exner, "The Sex Factor in Character Training," Journal of Social Hygiene 10 (7): 388 (1924). 65On the history of recapitulation theory botti within biological science and in the culture at large, see Stephan Jay Gould, Ontogeny and Phylogeny (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univer? sity Press, 1977). According to Gould, recapitulation, "the central theme of [Herbert] Spencer's cosmic defense of Victorian society," was "one ofthe most influential scientific ideas ofthe nineteenth century" (p. 109). The version of recapitulatory theory that dominated developmental sex education resembles the approach developed by Ernst Haeckel in the late 1860s. This view held that organisms reached their adult forms through a maturation process in which they repeated the sequential stages of their species' evolutionary development. From this explanation of common embryonic forms in diverse species it was a simple step to the claim that children embodied many "atavistic" relics of the development of civilized white human beings. Education worked hand in hand with nature to bring children safely through their phyletic histories and into the full promise of their species (see Cesare Lombroso, "Criminal Anthropology Applied to Pedagogy," The Monist 6: 56 [1895], quoted in Gould, 125). This Spencerian recapitulationism had gone out of style in biological circles by the 1920s (Gould, 132-33). By the time sex educators codified their pedagogical strategies into a recognizably recapitulatory framework, few evolutionary biologists would have embraced that framework as an accurate and adequate description of individual development. Nonetheless, the notion that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny remained influential in sex-educational circles, just as it retains its rhetorical appeal today. See Gould, chapter 5, for a discussion ofthe "pervasive influence" of recapitulationism in the extrabiological fields of criminal anthropol? ogy, racism, child development, primary education, and psychoanalysis. 66On the importance of grading sex education, see Bigelow, "The Educational Attack," 175-76; see also AFSH, Report ofthe Special Committee, 2.</page><page sequence="24">236 Julian B.

All they needed to know was that "sex" was synonymous with the development of family life. This evolutionary developmental perspective on sex as growth and pro? creation was in optimistic contrast to the knowledge of contagion. The frontispiece to Growing Up offers an excellent example of that contrast. This illustration, titled Out ofthe Everywhere, shows a naked baby in the grass (see fig. 2). Out ofthe Everywhere is suggestively similar in composi? tion to Irving Steinhardt's picture ofthe syphilitic baby. In both pictures, the children's bodies form triangles on the page: the syphilitic baby is an</page><page sequence="25">Toward an Intellectual History ofSex Education 237 isosceles triangle with the head at the apex and the feet as the lower two corners, while the baby from Everywhere is a right triangle defined by head, hand, and feet. In both images, the child's genitals are invisible but lo- cated roughly in the center ofthe triangle. This arrangement suggests that the genitals are the central signifiers ofa sex that cannot be directly repre? sented. What is directly represented, that is, the flesh arranged around an invisible centey, thus comes to stand for that center. The way in which the genitalia are centered, but not seen, disperses the representation of sex across the visible body; in both pictures, the nongenital body is rendered communicative about sex. But where the knowledge of contagion offered a vision of sex as the source of disease and death, the knowledge of devel? opment addressed sex as the origin and process of life and growth. Steinhardt's baby was shown dead and disintegrated, the sign of corrupted sexuality and superstition. The child in Out of the Everywhere signifies bouncing health, purity, and hope for the future. Its eyes are wide and its cheeks flushed as it drinks in its surroundings; its legs stick straight ahead and its round little toes are alertly splayed so that its whole body registers the wonder of being alive. It is also worth noting that the Steinhardt infant is displayed on a flat and undetailed background, with no context except some sheet and the faint suggestion of a gurney or undertaker's slab. The Everywhere baby, however, is plopped on the flower-covered edge of what appears to be a cliff in the Alps. Since there is nothing in the picture to explain the baby's presence in the mountains, the implication is that it belongs there just as the vegetation belongs there. The child is embedded in the natural world. Despite the exalted view of sex it captures, the painting of the Every? where baby also registers the persistence ofa deep discomfort with sex and the transmission of sexual knowledge. The title ofthe painting refers to a nursery rhyme by the popular nineteenth-century children's author George MacDonald, which opens Where did you come from, baby dear? Out ofthe everywhere, into here.67 67George MacDonald, "The Baby," reprinted in Fiona and Peter Opie, eds., The Oxford Book of'Children's Verse (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973), 273. The rhyme first appeared in the serial Good Words for the Toung (London: A. Strahan) in the August 1870 installment of MacDonald's novel At the Back ofthe North Wind (published in volume form by Strahan, 1871). "The Baby" seems to have struck a resonant chord; I have found it reprinted in long-lived anthologies for adults (Benjamin Jefferis and J. L. Nichols, Light on Dark Corners [c. 1880; reprint, New York: Grove Press, 1967]) and for children (Volume Two of Charles H. Sylvester, Journeys through Bookland [Chicago: Bellows-Reeve, c. 1909]). The poem is included in Journeys through Bookland at least through the 1927 edition; fur? ther research may well establish its continuity in reprintings to 1972.</page><page sequence="26">238 Julian B. Carter In a dizzying inversion of the usual sex-educational project, the infant is made to answer the question of its own birth. It does so in cosmic terms that evade any mention of its origin in the fleshly act of copulation. Suc- cessive verses explain the child's appearance by reference to angels, stars, and a gentle breeze; even pollen was, apparently, too suggestively material a sexual metaphor for MacDonald. This ambivalent attitude toward sexual information permeated the knowledge of development. That ambivalence is strikingly clear in the elaborate and inarticulate metaphorical structure of developmental sex education's lessons. Most such lessons featured mating and growth in nonhuman life-forms. Growing Up was typical of developmental educa? tion in employing plants and a good-sized menagerie of exemplary ani? mals to make its points. This strategy served several functions. First, it placed human sex and reproduction in the larger context of life on earth. As de Schweinitz pointed out to his juvenile readers, "Lions, elephants, dogs, horses, alligators, fish, robins, chickens, frogs all begin their lives in the same way that you did. They start as tiny eggs."68 The colorful details of animal mating were also useful when sex educators sought to impress their readers with the exalted aesthetic character of sex. De Schweinitz used evening primroses, the peacock's tail, and the Taj Mahal as examples ofthe beautiful things that had their root in sex; other educators used different animals or focused on the elaborate details of fetal development, but in all instances the goal was to bring sex "out ofthe shadows of secrecy and degradation."69 In short, Growing Up and other evolutionary sex education taught that sex was pure, in fact that it was precious, insofar as it was true to its essen- tially developmental and reproductive "nature." Margaret Sanger summed up the field with her usual directness when she explained to mothers that the whole object of teaching the child about reproduction through evolution is to clear its mind of any shame or mystery concerning its birth and to impress it with the beauty and naturalness of procreation, in order to prepare it for the knowledge of puberty and marriage.70 This is unambiguous enough. Yet notice that the sex education in ques? tion was only a preparation for deferred knowledges "of puberty and mar? riage." Despite their repeated vociferations about the "beauty and naturalness" of sex, developmental sex instructors were far more articu- 68Karl de Schweinitz, Growing Up: The Story ofHow We Become Alive, Are Born, and Grow Up (New York: Macmillan, 1928), 23. 69Bigelow, "Established Points," 5. The Taj Mahal was included because it was a monu- ment to the love its builder bore to his dead wife; the peacock's tail and the evening prim- rose, because they were examples of the way in which beauty was biologically useful in attracting mates. 70Sanger, 2.</page><page sequence="27">Toward an Intellectual History ofSex Education 239 late about the biology of conception and fetal development than about the behaviors, pleasures, and pains that comprise sexual experience. For instance, de Schweinitz devoted five ofhis seven chapters to descriptions of eggs, nests, pollen, and sperm, but he mentioned the experience of human sexuality or sexual acts only obliquely, in the statement that "a man and a woman may feel like sending the sperm to join the egg but they do not do this unless they love each other."71 Such language left at least one ten-year-old reader of Growing Up with the impression that sexual intercourse was a medical procedure; other youngsters doubtless were equally misled.72 It would be an error, however, to imagine that develop? mental sexual knowledge was flatly opposed to sexual pleasure. It would be more accurate to say that this strand of sex education attempted to recuperate and contain pleasure within purity, by conflating it with loving family life. Here again we can see the ambivalence that pervaded early-twentieth- century sex education. Sex was, for most educators of the developmental school, a profoundly positive and satisfying experience?insofar as it was hedged about with a sexual knowledge that they represented as inseparable from chastity until marriage. Desire, the argument went, only appeared shamefiil and base to those whose knowledge of it was impure. As one successful little booklet explained to adolescents, If we charge nature with the evil consequences of this impulse, we have not understood how difficult it has been to make certain of ani? mal reproduction without offering a strong motive; or, in the case of human beings with memory, to get them to undergo the danger and to make the sacrifice associated with reproduction.73 This passage emphasizes the extent to which human intellectual capacities, here represented by memory, made desire seem more complicated and dan? gerous than it needed to be. But human rationality was also defended as a source of marital happiness and fertility: the previous passage implies that accurate understanding rcndcrs desire safely inseparable from reproduction. Sexual desire was further abstracted and intellectualized in the interests of the developmental model when educators described it as the "germi- nating seed" that gave rise to "the human qualities and associations most prized: namely, love, marriage, home, father, mother, love for the child, filial and paternal devotion, and from these a social system."74 Another description of desire used the knowledge of evolution to argue that eroti- cism outside of loving marriage was biologically passe: 71de Schweinitz, Growing Up, 104. 72Campbell, 86. 73Bigelow, "Established Points," 4; Bertha Chapman Cady and Vernon Mosher Cady, The Way Life Begins (1917; reprint, New York: American Social Hygiene Association, 1926), 17. 74Cady and Cady, 17.</page><page sequence="28">240 Julian B. Carter Out ofthe original plan for double parentage of new individual bear? ers ofthe spark of living substance, there has developed through the ages of human life psychical or spiritual love with all its splendid pos? sibilities as found in ideal family life. In other words, out ofthe mate? rial or physical aspects of reproduction have evolved or developed the possibilities ofthe conjugal affection ofthe parents for each other and parental affection for the offspring.75 In this self-consciously "scientific" point of view, the sexual urge was the ancient raw material out of which wise nature crafted love and modern family life. Therefore, when de Schweinitz and his peers wrote about hu? man mating in terms that emphasized loving marriage rather than sexual activity, they were not simply avoiding discussions of desire. Rather, they were arguing that desire's most human nature was marital and reproduc? tive, on the one hand, and highly intellectualized, on the other. This posi? tion enabled them to avoid mentioning actual human sexual behaviors.76 Instead, such arguments emphasized the epistemological dimensions of sex. All creatures reproduce, these educators reminded their young read? ers. The difference between humans and other animals is that "only people know how babies are born and they are the only creatures that plan to live together and have children."77 As developmental sex educators told stories about animal reproduc? tion, then, they were putting human sex into a quite specific relationship to nature and to knowledge. They were deliberately dissolving the bound- ary between humans and the rest ofthe earth's inhabitants, encouraging the first predominantly urban generation to think of themselves as inti- mately related to the natural world. They hoped that the artificiality and vulgarity of Jazz Age urban life would be ameliorated by the naturalist perspective on sex, which emphasized its loveliness and its developmental character. But the sex educators also drew a line between humans and other animals. Below that line were all creatures who mated without love and without access to the knowledge of reproduction. For such animals, sex was identical with sexual activity. Above the line were Homo sapiens, with the capacity for sentient sexuality. As one educator explained, "The family life of animals is constituted of animal instinct freely followed. The family life of man would be ruined by the free following of animal instinct. . . . The human child is . . . not only with the animals a creature of instinct, 75Bigelow, "Established Points," 5. 76lt is worth noting that the knowledge of development rarely called sexual intercourse by that name. Instead, in the quoted passages sex is a "sacred passion," a "germinating seed," the source of "conjugal affection." Copulation itself, that is, the means by which "a man and woman . . . send the sperm to join the egg," remained outside the language of sex education. 77de Schweinitz, Growing Up, 104.</page><page sequence="29">Toward an Intellectual History ofSex Education 241 but with humanity a being with ideas."78 The capacity for fully human sex, that is, intentional procreation in loving marriage, was the product of ages of evolution, a heritage shared by the species as a whole. Nonetheless, individual human beings had to grow, and be educated, into their full sexual inheritance of combined wisdom and affection. The Birds and the Bees (and the Fish, and the Frogs) The knowledge of development offered parents, and especially mothers, a place in their children's sex education by explaining that a woman does not need to be a college graduate, with a special degree in the study of botany, before she can tell her child the beautiful truth of its birth. But she does need to clear her own mind of prudishness, and to understand that the procreative act is natural, clean, and health- ful; that all nature is beautified through it, and consequently that it is devoid of offensiveness. If the mother can impress the child with the beauty and wonder and sacredness ofthe sex functions, she has taught it the first lesson, and the teacher can elaborate on these teachings as the child advances in school.79 Such manuals sought to enlist parents in the fight for sex education by suggesting first that such lessons were simple, second that they needed to involve very little actual transfer of information, and third that the point was to prevent complete sexual ignorance from rendering children vulner- able to the corrupt influences of popular culture. One ofthe more popu? lar manuals for parents, which went through three editions between 1923 and 1932, affirmed the stance that early childhood sex education was pri? marily a matter of creating a wholesome epistemological environment. Benjamin Gruenberg's Parents and Sex Education held that the knowledge of sex and reproduction which the child . . . receives will be permanently colored in his mind by the manner and circum? stances ofhis first impressions. It is therefore desirable that his first impressions be associated with the love of parents, with having his curiosity satisfied in a sympathetic atmosphere, and with coming to understand his body and its functions as perfectly normal parts ofthe world of life.80 78William Greenleaf Eliot, Jr., "Teaching Phases: For Children," in The Social Emer- gency: Studies in Sex Hygiene and Morals, ed.

Carter As we have seen, in such usages "sex" did not need to entail direct refer- ence to "the procreative act." Indeed, many manuals told parents that the earliest sexual lessons did not need to include much more information than that babies came from their mothers. The larger lesson that parents were supposed to teach their children was that sex was by its nature a familial phenomenon, and that sexual knowledge was inseparable from family life. One particularly maudlin story about how sex education bound children's sex to their mothers was retold a number of times in slightly different forms. In this story, the "twentieth-century mother" is in bed after giving birth to a new baby. Her six-year-old son is brought to visit her and meet his little sister, and when he asks where the baby came from she answers: "Baby sister came out of mamma's body; baby sister was formed within mamma's body; she was formed from materials taken out of mamma's blood, and that is the reason why mamma's hands are so thin and white and mamma's cheeks so pale." The boy asked whether he, too, had come from her body. The mother replied that he had, and that "that's the reason why mamma loves her little boy so, because she gave her own life blood to make his body." The little boy's eyes took on a far-away look and he was evidently trying to grasp the great idea of mother sacrifice. Evidently this child mind got at last a glimmer of the great truth, because presently his wide-open eyes filled full of tears, and turning to his mamma he threw his arms around her neck and said, "Oh, mamma, I never loved you so much before." The author of this touching tale went on to stress its moral: That mother, by thus filling her child's mind with thoughts of the sacredness of motherhood, completely occupied its virgin soil, giving no place for the noisome weeds of vulgarity and obscenity to germi- nate and grow.81 When children were taught that sex was reproduction and maternal love, they were being trained to restrict their sexuality to the family. All else was "vulgarity and obscenity." The story of the "twentieth-century mother" highlights the episte- mological dimensions of developmental sex education. It presumes that 81This story is by influential sex educator Winfield Scott Hall, who seems to have included different versions of it in more than one publication. See, e.g., "The Relation of Education in Sex to Race Betterment," Social Hygiene 1 (1): 70-71 (December 1914). The version quoted appeared in the USPHS pamphlet no. 61, Sex Education in the Home (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1930), 3-4. Other sex educators had similar stories about the way in which sex instruction bound children to parents; see Mrs. [Rose] Wood-Allen Chapman, How Shall I Tell My Child (New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1912), 13-15.</page><page sequence="31">Toward an Intellectual History ofSex Education 243 sexual behavior follows from sexual knowledge as light follows from day- break: this child, having made a cognitive link between sex and maternal love, is described as intellectually incapable of "vulgarity and obscenity." Furthermore, it emphasizes that the experience of learning, in and of it? self, was of greater significance than the content ofthe lessons. The only concrete information offered to this six-year-old was that children are some- how derived from their mothers' blood, an arcane bit of knowledge that is, on its surface, neither especially enlightening to a small child, nor im? possible to reconcile with vulgarity. Yet the lesson that the boy learned was that motherhood is sacred, a lesson that derives from the context, more than the content, of the educational conversation. To the extent that content mattered, the story ofthe "twentieth-century mother" sug? gests that almost anything would do, as long as the focus was firmly famil? ial and reproductive. This kind of stance on knowledge determined the content of the sex education offered in increasing numbers of public schools during this era. Whether offered in the form of pamphlets, lectures, or hands-on class work, sex education in elementary and junior high schools ofthe twenties and thirties tended to focus on what was called "nature study." Students were inundated with a "story of life" that was, more accurately, a popular- ization of theories ofthe evolutionary development of monogamous mar? riage. As the years passed, students were made acquainted with the process of reproduction in a variety of animals and plants, but human babies were very rarely mentioned in these lessons. Instead, schoolchildren under ten or twelve were taught, quite literally, about the birds and the bees. Since elementary schoolchildren's development was still not far ad- vanced, the lessons they were offered were predominantly about organisms representing early stages in the evolution of life. Pamphlets and books for children, and teachers' reports from schools, suggest that many youngsters began their sex education with the study of flowers.82 Lucky children with imaginative parents, or in especially advanced schools, were allowed to plant large seeds, such as beans, and pull some of them up at different times to observe the stages of germination.83 Others watched a teacher dissect a large flower such as a lily, or were shown illustrations of its different parts, 82ln fact, since the lessons offered small children were usually repeated in more ad? vanced grades, sex education for all ages began with flowers more often than not.

However the class was conducted, the children were expected to learn two things: all life comes from eggs; and before an egg can hatch, a fertilizing agent is necessary.84 Stress was always placed on the process of pollination, to emphasize the point that all beings have two parents: "By itself the pollen could not grow to be a seed. The egg needs the pollen and the pollen needs the egg."85 In fact, of course, not all life comes from eggs, and it is not true that all beings have two parents. The lilies used as examples in sex-education lit? erature are most often cultivated from bulbs, which reproduce asexually. But the point of such nature study was not a good grounding in botany so much as indoctrination with the idea that sex took place between women (egg producers) and men (fertilizers), whose union inevitably produced offspring. Blithely ignoring the astonishing range of sexual techniques employed by flowering plants, sex educators used them as a metaphor for gender-polarized human parents. The blossom, with its ovary, sweet fra? grance, and showy petals, stood for feminine womanhood, gracious and passively receptive to the advances of its apian visitors. The bees (or wasps or moths) bumbled and pushed their pollen-laden way into the heart of the flower. In some nature-study descriptions, the bees seem like rotund, bearded daddies for the next generation of plants. Karl de Schweinitz even went so far as to call the relationship between flowers and insects "making love."86 As nature study went on, pupils examined or read about fishes, frogs, and birds. With each kind of creature, the elementary points about dual parenthood and fertilized eggs were repeated, but a few new points were added as the lessons progressed up the evolutionary scale. Most of these points emphasized that full humanity meant loving marriage and careful parenthood. Evolutionary development from simple animals to complex ones was depicted as the progressive development of care for offspring. Fishes, because they are ancient animals, were used to represent the primi- tive era before the development of parenthood. Under the subheading "The Mother Fish Neglects Her Babies," one popular pamphlet for ten- year-olds explained: The baby fish are produced in great numbers because so many of them get lost or are eaten by other fish or by birds or other animals. The father and mother fish cannot take care of their young ones. . . . Fish, you understand, are rather low in the animal kingdom, and they have not yet learned how to take care of their young. You will be surprised to know that a mother sunfish would not know her own 84See Thurman B.

I am sure you are glad that you are one ofthe human race, which knows so much more and takes so much better care of its boys and girls than any fish would know how to do.87 Having disposed of fish as unsuitable models for human families, young? sters turned to studying amphibians. As parents, frogs had clearly made advances over fishes in that frogs' eggs are protected by a jelly, which makes it difficult for predators to get a grip on them, and which also serves as a lens to intensify the sun's heat and help the eggs incubate quickly. But frogs had to be left behind, for the advances of amphibian civilization did not extend to any form of family life. Birds introduced a note of cozy domesticity into nature study: Perhaps you have seen the birds chasing each other in the spring and have supposed that they were fighting. Not at all! The male birds fre? quently fight each other when they are courting the female, but the two mates do not fight. They build the nest together; they help one another; the male carries food to the female when she is on the nest; he protects her from harm; and if we may judge by his actions he loves her in very much the same way that your own father loves your mother. Of course then he would not wish to fight her! He is merely giving her the substance from his own body which she can then put into the eggs so that the baby birds will be part his and part her children.88 Such passages serve as reminders that the goal of all this nature study was not accurate and detailed knowledge of animal sexuality, social behavior, or reproduction. Rather, it was designed to indoctrinate youngsters with a specific vision of marriage and family life. Many birds pair-bond, at least for a given mating season; they divide the work of reproduction and chick raising along lines that lend themselves to anthropomorphic gendering; and they appear to be devoted parents.89 For these reasons birds were easy to use as illustrations of human marriage. Anthropomorphism also made birds useful as examples of human failings. One educator reported an inci- dent in her classroom that upheld the value of nature study as sex educa? tion. She had used cowbirds, which do not pair-bond, as an example of bad parenting; the male bird, she said, "mates with the mother bird and then flies away, giving no thought for the mother or the young ones." The female cowbird does what an unwed and abandoned mother should: she leaves her eggs in another bird's nest, to be incubated by a "fostermother." A big, square-backed boy from the rear ofa tenement-house district, hearing the story ofthe cowbird, kicked a stone and announced, "Say, 87Rice, The Story ofLife, 14-15. 88Ibid., 20. 89For instance, Rice, How Life Goes On and On, 8, includes the story of an oriole "mother" who died protecting her nest.</page><page sequence="34">246 Julian B. Carter I call that cowbird father a mean skunk." Perhaps, if we teach our boys before adolescence, we may safeguard them from becoming ir- responsible fathers and from bringing children into the world until they are ready to protect them.90 If even the louts from the tenements could be touched by nature study, surely there was no need to teach children sex in human terms. Many, perhaps most, sex-education programs in the elementary grades stopped at this point; certainly in the early years of the century, mammals were not generally discussed with children below the age of twelve.91 Some? times even high school students stopped with birds. In 1915, for example, approximately fifteen hundred freshmen were required to take biology at a large high school in New York City. Their curriculum included instruc- tion in nutrition, "hygienic habits of living," and the "fundamental prin? ciples of the reproductive function" in flowering plants, fishes, insects, and birds. Explaining this program, James Peabody, the head ofthe biol? ogy department, said simply: "We do not think it wise to discuss mamma- lian reproduction in mixed classes in the first year."92 This reticence was deliberate and widespread, and was generally justified by reference to the recapitulatory schedule of development. Since ninth-graders were still too young to mate themselves, they were too young to be taught about mat? ing. That could wait until they had finished recapitulating the youth of the race and were ready to settle down to breed the next generation. But when some seniors met Peabody after school to ask for information about sexual intercourse, he reported that he "told the boys frankly that these were topics that did not in any way concern them at their time of life."93 To this science teacher, the relevant "time of life" was not guaranteed by physical maturity in the sense of biologic reproductive capacity?which, surely, these seniors had attained. Instead, Peabody explained that he would be willing to discuss intercourse with them after they had gotten engaged.94 This evasiveness is perfectly consistent with the recapitulatory stance characteristic of developmental education: having defined sexual intercourse as synonymous with marriage, educators felt justified in withholding knowl? edge about it from students who were not as yet engaged. At the same time, this evasiveness marks the continued presence ofthe ambivalence that the knowledge of development sought to contain precisely through its reli- ance on the recapitulatory model. On the political level, avoiding explicit 90Laura B.

But on the epistemological level, the attempt to sidestep public ambiva? lence about sex education simply displaced that ambivalence, so that it re- appeared within the lesson plan in the form ofa refiisal to teach. In 1916, the prize-winning pamphlet "Sex in Life: For Boys and Girls of Twelve to Sixteen Years" limited its explanation of reproduction in humans thus: Life itself you can learn only by living. That is why, until you yourself have married your true mate, and have known the joy of being a mother or a father, you cannot really understand the beautiful truths ofa baby's creation.... When you yourself have learned of these holy things, ofthe splendor of life and love, by your own experience, you will know that no one could have told you about them.95 What are we to make ofa pedagogical situation in which educators not only refused to teach but justified that refiisal with the claim that experience was the one true guide to knowledge? After all, sex education usually went to great lengths to ensure that young people did not seek experience as an avenue to sexual knowledge. And certainly the mysticism of this passage requires explanation, since the point of graded lessons was to develop the rational attitudes toward sex that set humans apart from other animals, that made them part ofthe natural world and yet able to govern it and transcend its limitations. Developmental sex education hoped to provide heterosexual, reproductive monogamy with a firm scientific foundation. But for all its rhetorical reliance on biological science, the knowledge of development was interested in the "scientific truth" of sex only insofar as that truth could be made to support a particular vision of sexual and social order. In the natural world that developmental sex education pre- scribed, recapitulatory development inevitably culminated in the social institution of marriage. When "growing up" meant becoming a husband or wife, other measures of adulthood acquired a marital cast as well, so that the age of reason appeared to be the age at which people could un? derstand sex-as-marriage, and accession to citizenship seemed marked by the ability to reproduce the national body. Reason, political agency, and morality were thus yoked together under the rubric of evolution, which was represented as having shaped human sexuality into a naturally mo? nogamous and reproductive form. Yet if evolution dictated marital monogamy, wherein lay the need for sex education at all? And why not discuss human mating directly, instead of telling the story ofthe cowbird or emphasizing the mutual interdepen- dence of bee and flower? Evidently, evolution had not progressed to the 95Donald and Eunice Armstrong, "Sex in Life: For Boys and Girls of Twelve to Sixteen Years," reprinted in Social Hygiene 2 (4): 331-32 (October 1916).</page><page sequence="36">248 Julian B. Carter point that it could be trusted to guarantee human sexual development along the straight and narrow path to virgin marriage. Education's job was to guide young moderns away from the "vulgar" world of multiple sexual possibilities and toward the belief that eroticism belonged in the marriage bed. In this sense, developmental education can be said to reflect the uncomfortable knowledge that in fact nature did not guarantee sexual conformity to middle-class reformers' cultural mores. When teachers re- fused to instruct young adults about human erotic experience, they were fending off the fear that desire was at odds with the sexual restraint they believed was necessary to modern civilization. But what were those teach? ers to do? Without sex education, the society as a whole ran the risk that ignorance could diminish human sexuality to the instinctive level of the irrational brute in a state of nature. But access to too much information about the actual range of sexual feelings, acts, and experiences could un- dermine the family, the rock on which rested all morality, all national strength and well-being, and ultimately civilization itself. Conclusion Between 1910 and 1940, sex educators faced the problem of how to teach young people about sex without encouraging licentiousness?in other words, how to educate them in a way that would guarantee premarital chastity and marital monogamy. This was not a purely pedagogical prob? lem but a properly epistemological one as well. In the minds of many early-twentieth-century reformers, the questions of what we know about sex and how we know it were inextricably linked to the assumptions that scientific truths buttress moral ones and that accurate knowledge leads to morally upright action. Such assumptions played a decisive role in deter- mining what kinds of knowledges about sex were thinkable, and how these knowledges could be passed on to the next generation. Due to these as? sumptions, the reformers' good Progressive intentions of combating vice, suffering, disease, and divorce through education were plagued and un- dermined by a profound ambivalence. For fear of encouraging licentious? ness by giving people too much information about sex, educators frequently sacrificed the "scientific truth" in favor of whatever kind of information or teaching strategy was most likely to encourage premarital chastity and marital monogamy. In this essay I have shown how these tensions were manifest in the two dominant epistemological approaches to sex educa? tion in the three decades before the Second World War. As we have seen, the knowledge of contagion tried to resolve this fun? damental tension between the dangers of ignorance and the dangers of education by isolating some forms of empirical scientific knowledge and declaring that these were intrinsically virtuous and beneficial. The facts about venereal disease, according to this branch of sex education, encour- aged sexual restraint. Accurate venereal information was a prophylactic</page><page sequence="37">Toward an Intellectual History ofSex Education 249 that could protect family, home, and nation from the diseases spread by sexual ignorance and the false knowledges rife in commercial sexual cul? ture. But this emphasis on expert factual knowledge about infection back- fired. As Jeffrey Moran has shown, many people resented the intrusion of scientific expertise into what they thought of as the private, moral space of the home.96 Many others were horrified at the way in which the venereo- logical perspective suggested that any and all details of pathology and morbidity were pedagogically legitimate and useful because empirically verifiable. Thus, while the proponents of the knowledge of contagion claimed to be championing a clean-minded and socially beneficial sexual knowledge, they were unable to protect themselves from the charge that they were themselves disseminators of dangerously contagious knowledge that could undermine sexual idealism and romantic love. The knowledge of contagion, which set out to save the American family from venereal disease, also constituted a threat to the heterosexual relationships that made this family possible. Like the knowledge of contagion, the knowledge of development began with the assumption that illicit and immoral sexual acts were the result of ignorance. But while the knowledge of contagion tried to ensure moral rec- titude by providing knowledge about venereal disease and sterility, the knowledge of development took the more positive stance that people would choose the morally upright life once they understood that all of evolution evinced the progress of nature toward the goal of monogamous marriage, reproduction, and child rearing. The knowledge of development tried to avoid controversy by eliding the difference between scientific truth and so? cial or moral ideals. Developmental education took the position that evolu- tionary sexual knowledge was identical with sexual conformity. Thus, it taught children to view sex as a natural function, on the one hand, and to conflate sex with marriage and the family, on the other. This approach seemed to claim that there were no dangers, and therefore no tensions, in developmental sex education: all that the knowledge of development en- tailed was a scientific introduction to human nature. But this ingenuous stance was impossible to sustain. Marriage and the family are not in fact simply "natural" functions of sex, and when adolescents asked for concrete factual information about erotic relationships, that fact threatened to come to the surface. As a result, the knowledge of development found itself forced to negotiate between its claims to be scientific and its desire to foster a vision of sex as coterminous with marriage. Like the knowledge of contagion, the knowledge of development was motivated by the desire to restrain vice and inculcate virtue, and when that project came into conflict with representa- tional accuracy in the sexual field, the latter was always sacrificed. In this way, ambivalence about sexual knowledge was transmitted to a new generation of participants in the public discourse of sex in the United States. 96See Moran, "Modernism Gone Mad," 483, 502-6.</page></plain_text>
