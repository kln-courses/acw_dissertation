Introduction Few the aspects Bithynian of the youth reign Antinous of Hadrian and have the latter attracted s mysterious as much drowning attention death as his reputed in the Nile passion River for in the Bithynian youth Antinous and the latter s mysterious drowning death in the Nile River in October of A.D. 130 while accompanying the emperor on his visit to Egypt.1 Antinous 's subsequent A number of people deserve my thanks for providing invalu- able feedback at various stages of this article's preparation. Of particular note are those who read it in draft form: William V. Harris, Jerzy Linderski, Franziska Naether, and Heinz-Josef Thissen, as well as the two anonymous readers. To these should be added the members of the University of Michigan community who attended my presentation of an early draft for the Interdepartmental Program in Greek and Roman History's brown-bag luncheon series and par- ticipated in the subsequent discussion, providing numerous helpful observations and suggestions: among them, Harriet Fertik, Sara Forsdyke, Ian Moyer, David Potter, Raymond Van Dam, and fellow visitor David Wardle deserve special recognition. I also had the opportunity to present a paper on this subject at the Universität Leipzig in November 2009 and am grateful to the faculty and students of the Lehrstuhl Alte Geschichte and the Ägyptologisches Institut/Ägyp- tisches Museum-Georg Steindorff- for their attendance on a bleak, rainy night and for their stimulating questions and observations. Since beginning work on this project I have benefited enormously from consultations on particular issues with a number of scholars: Mary T. Boatwright, Alexandra von Lieven, Michael B. Lippman, John Matthews, Lawrence Richardson, jr., Susan Sorek, and Terry Wilfong. Of those named in these acknowledgments, I must thank Naether in particular for her constant and generous assistance as I explored the Hieroglyphic and Demotic sources, as well as Thissen and Wilfong for their patient and helpful responses to my numerous questions. Without the assistance of these three I would have been unable to handle many of the com- plex Egyptological issues discussed below, and if the present work is thought to make a contribution to scholarship on the history of the Antinous cult, then they deserve significant credit. Lastly, I should note that this article, though started before my arrival, was mosdy written during the time that I was a visiting scholar in the Department of Classical Studies at Michigan and also while I was holding a Tytus Fellowship at the University of Cincinnati, and I wish to thank those at both institutions who provided me these opportunities. 1 On this event, see esp. Lambert 1984; Zahrnt 1988, 670-675; Birley 1997, 235-258; Kuhlmann 2002, 76-79, 136-139 et pass.; Galimberti 2007, 139-144; Grenier 2008, 47-55. The date of the drowning is unknown, though there has been specu- lation that it coincided with the 22 October commemoration of the drowning death of Osiris (see Birley 1997, 247 ; Kuhlmann 2002, 199; Vout 2007, 58-59; for the link between Antinous and Osiris, see below). More recendy, Jean-Claude Grenier has argued for dates in August or September, based in part on the lunar cycle and the moon goddess's link to the apotheosis that is mentioned in some sources (Vout 2007, 55). Such claims are circumstantial at best, and it is only certain that the drowning occurred before 30 October, when Hadrian established the city of Antinoopolis (but see Grenier 2008, 57-58 with a con- trary position on the relation between these two events). This matter might have been clarified by an Oxyrhynchus papyrus providing a calendar of cult offerings that includes celebra- tion of the èxôéwaiç (i.e., apotheosis) of Antinous - possibly at Alexandria - but the date has been lost from this fragmentary document (P.Oxy 31.2553, frag. I, lines 1-3; see Gilliam 1978, 123-126). At best, this papyrus provides a general timeframe, since the next date on the calendar is 30 November, Antinous's birthday, making a date earlier in November or else in October most likely because otherwise one would expect at least one other holiday to be sandwiched between them. As has righdy been argued by Christopher P. Jones, the nature of the relationship between Hadrian and Antinous is ambiguous, though it does appear likely to have had a sexual dimension (Jones 2010, 81-82). While no parallel for this episode is known for Roman times, it has been noted (e.g., Vout 2007, 117-118; Jones 2010, 76) that there are some striking similarities with Alexander the Great's grief at the death of Hephaestion and subsequent efforts to establish his companion's worship as a hero (Plut. Alex. 72; Arrian 7.23.8). Curiously, Jones 2010, 82 notes that deceased mortals for whom hero cults were established were "never lovers," which would make Antinous - and possibly Hephaestion as well, if the similar speculation about him and Alexander is correct - an exception to this pattern. MAAR 55, 2010</page><page sequence="2">160 GIL H. RENBERG divinizatíon and the material remains attesting to his being honored and worshiped all over the Roman Empire as a hero or god for an unknown period of time likewise have been the subject of numer- ous studies.2 As is usually noted in treatments of this episode, Antinous became known for issuing oracles soon after his death, initially through Hadrian but later in the same manner as other divinities.3 However, the circumstances surrounding his establishment as an oracular god in Egypt have not been fully investigated. When the one historical source for Antinous issuing oracles through Hadrian is considered in the context of evidence from seemingly unrelated inscriptions and literature as well as an apparent comment by Eusebius that Antinous was honored as a divinity because of a revelation, a possible explanation for this phenomenon emerges: the emperor, still grieving over his loss, experienced one or more dreams in which Antinous appeared to him and spoke words that Hadrian conveyed to his contemporaries as oracular revelations.4 If so, Antinous s distinction as the last (known) new oracular god to arise in Egypt would be attributable to dreams, as would also have been the case with Hadrian's determination that Antinous had become a divinity and should be worshiped as one. Such a possibility emerges if one examines not only the literature and other sources associated with the death and divinizatíon of Antinous and the diffusion of his cult, but also the sources for the dead appearing in dreams as well as certain aspects of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian religion that together provide a possible context for the events that began to unfold when Antinous went overboard. While the death of Antinous is described briefly in three historical sources, Cassius Dio, Aure- lius Victor, and the Vita Hadriani featured in the Historia Augusta , only the latter refers to his son issuing oracles thereafter.5 According to this work's brief treatment of the episode, Antinoum suum, dum per Nilum navigai, perdidit, quem muliebriter flevit. De quo varia fama est aliis eum devotum pro Hadriano adserentibus, aliis, quod et forma eius ostentat et nimia voluptas Hadriani. Et Graeci quidem volente Hadriano eum consecraverunt, oracula per eum dari adserentes, quae Hadrianus ipse conposuisse iactatur. (Hadrian) lost his Antinous, over whom he wept like a woman, while sailing on the Nile. Con- cerning this, there are different rumors: it is asserted by some that Antinous offered himself as a sacrifice on behalf of Hadrian, by others what both Antinous s beauty and Hadrian's excessive pleasure-seeking points to. And the Greeks, in fact, deified him following Hadrian's wishes, maintaining that oracles were being issued by him, which Hadrian himself allegedly composed.6 The Historia Augusta is, of course, notoriously unreliable, but since both literary sources and a Hi- eroglyphic text attest to Antinous 's oracular nature, the claim made by the Vita Hadriani deserves to be considered at least somewhat credible. If this last sentence in the quoted passage was correct, 2 See esp. Hölbl 1981, 168-174; Meyer 1991; Kuhlmann 2002, 197-239; Nollé 2004; Vout 2005 (cf. Vout 2007, 52-135); Mambella 2008; 0pper2008, 166-191; Jones 2010, 75-83. On the royal aspects of Antinous's representation, see Grenier 2008, 59-64. For Antinous on coins, as well as the issue of Antinous being worshiped as both a hero and a god, see n. 47. His inclusion on contorniates in late antiquity has been seen as a sign that his divine powers were still well respected (see Alföldi-Rosenbaum 1991). 3 For the problem of whether Antinous's function as an oracular god was limited to Antinoopolis, see pp. 176-178. 4 This article's arguments all presuppose that Hadrian, whose religious activities are well attested (see n. 43), was not acting in a knowingly fraudulent manner when he claimed to be con- veying oracles of Antinous to his subjects. That these oracles were devised by "those who played on people's credulity," i.e., either Hadrian or unspecified Egyptians, was unjustifi- ably assumed by Herbert W. Benario in his commentary on this passage (Benario 1980, 100). 5 Cass. Dio 69.11.2-4; Aur. Vict. Caes. 14.6-7. 6 SHA Hadr. 14.5-7. On this passage, see Fündling 2006, 687-701. Cf.

But in this case, it was not one god dictating the worship of himself or another god but rather a deceased mortal indicating to a person who had cared for him that divine honors were due him. The primary medium for this particular sort of communication among the Greeks and later the Romans was dreams, for it was in dreams that the living regularly believed themselves to be visited by deceased loved ones and associates. 2. Dreaming of the Dead The literary evidence for individuals envisioning the dead in dreams is abundant, dating back to Homer s description of Achilles being asked by the fallen Patroklos to see to his funeral rites and burial and continuing into late antiquity, when Augustine discussed the phenomenon, referring to accounts of spirits whose bodies lay unburied appearing in dreams to indicate the location and demand proper burial.8 Such literary accounts, as well as discussions of ghosdy visitations in philosophical works and other genres, are complemented by a largely overlooked group of Greek and Latin epitaphs that record dreams - ostensibly dreams in which the deceased had appeared and sought burial rites or other honors - or else express a desire for such dreams.9 This small but significant group of funerary inscriptions, numbering over a dozen, all date to Roman times and are to be found in both the Greek East and Latin West. Collectively they represent compelling evidence for the belief among ordinary individuals that dreams of the deceased were a form of visitation and a means of receiving specific messages from beyond the grave - a commonplace phenomenon pos- sibly writ large in the case of Hadrian and Antinous. In Lydia, for example, a woman erected what must have been a cenotaph after receiving a dream informing her that a male family member had died at sea: PJsxouTiXXa xaià | öveiqov | KaAÀivixoç xeï&lt;[ xa&gt;i | èv ÔQoasQoïç | èv öyXoioi 8' áví I xrjxoç áX(iuQ[oT|ç. 7 1 am reading per as "by" since in rare instances the preposi- tion was used in passive constructions to indicate agency (see Thesaurus linguae latinae 10.1, 1148.11-71, s.v. "per" and Kühner and Stegmann 1955, §105(c)a). For a similar reading, see Kuhlmann's "Die Griechen vergöttlichten ihn jedenfalls nach Hadrians Willen mit der Behauptung, er gebe Orakel, die Hadrian allerdings selbst verfasst haben soll" (Kuhlmann 2002, 137). This stands in contrast to some previous read- ings, such as Birley's vague "oracles were given through him" (Birley 1997, 248) and Goukowsky's unlikely "Les Grecs divinisèrent Antinoos par la volonté d'Hadrien, soutenant que des oracles étaient rendus par son intermédiaire, oracles dont on se demande s'ils ne furent pas composés par Hadrien lui-même" (Goukowsky 2002, 234, echoing J.-P. Callu's Budé translation, "... affirmant que par son intermédiaire étaient rendus des oracles"). 8 Нот. II. 23.59-107; Aug. De cura pro mort. ger. 10-13 ( CSEL 41.639-647). For ghosts appearing in dreams, see Stramaglia 1999, 21-27 et pass.; Felton 1999, 18-21 et pass.; Harris 2009, 59-60, 73 et pass. 9 For such tombstones, see Renberg 2003, 310-315 (cur- rently being revised for publication). Some of the pertinent inscriptions are briefly noted in Weber 2005-2006, 70-72, 88-89. In addition to the documents discussed below, I am informed by Dr. Cumhur Tanriver that he has been working on an unpublished funerary transcription from Mysia that belongs to this group.</page><page sequence="4">162 GIL H. RENBERG Sekoutilla (made this) according to a dream: I, Kallinikos, lie in watery depths, but unconquered among the briny multitude.10 A tombstone from Rome indicates that a man may have felt guilt over having delayed too long in providing his deceased wife with a proper funerary monument for their burial plot, perhaps because of financial constraints: C(aius) Agritius Firmus sibi et I Agriliae Feliculae l(ocum ) s(epulturae) fec(it) I ex visu hune titulum I eodem tempore luctum depos(u)it. I Quod vivae cupit obitae praestitit. Gaius Agrilius Firmus made for himself and Agrilia Felicula this burial place following a vision, and deposited this tombstone at the same time that he deposited his grief. What he wanted to give her while alive he has offered her in death.11 Less detail is to be found in a funerary altar from Thrace that was commissioned by one brother for another: "To the gods of the Underworld: For Gamikos, son of Alexander, a hero, his brother Zosimos, son of Alexander, (dedicated) this altar in compliance with a dream" (OeoTç хатоехбо | víoiç- Га[А1хф I AXe^ávÔQou rj(xoi | xòv ßwjjiöv xať öv[ocq] | 5 ó àôeXcpòç Zwai | [ioç AXsÇávÔQou).12 A similarly bland text appears on a small plaque from Rome that is believed to have originated at a suburban columbarium, where a son - revealed by his different nomenclature to have been adopted - fulfilled his filial obligations to his father: "To the Manes : For Quintus Servilius Pr [---], a most venerable father, Publius Siccius Crescens (effected this) in compliance with a dream" (. DisMan[ibus ]. I Patri san[ctissimo] I Q(uinto ) Servilio Pr[-] I P(ublius) Siccius Cresc[ens ex] I viso).13 Filial obligation also can be detected in an epigram from Roman-era Pergamům that is missing its left half and thus cannot be restored but can be identified as an epitaph for a woman who had appeared in one or more dreams ([vjuxxtcpavfj xa0' ikvov) to her sole surviving son.14 More poignant are the epitaphs commissioned by parents for their children. An elaborate relief representing the boy on horseback in a heroic pose that was prominently mounted in an ornate columbarium along Rome's Via Tarento bears the inscription, "To the god and hero Venerianus, a son most sweet, Eurotas and Veneria (commissioned this) in compliance with a dream" (0bcoi fjgcui I Oòeveçtavw | Eôgarcaç xat Oôe | veçia xéxvíj) | 5 y^uxuiáicj) | xať övocq). 15 A similar epitaph, twice as 10 ТАМ 5.1.661 (= Steinepigramme 1.426, no. 04/08/01) (mod. Gölmarmara, between Hyrkanis and Daldis; Imperial period); see Renberg 2010, 55-51. A literary parallel can be seen in the myth of Alcyone, who continues to beg the gods daily for the safe return of her husband Ceyx, until Juno finally takes pity on her and sends a dream in the form of Ceyx informing her that he has been lost at sea and should be mourned (Ov. Met. 11.411-748, esp. 573-709). 11 CIL 6.11262 (= CLE 385) (Rome; Imperial period). Prop- ertius provides a literary parallel when he writes that his beloved Cynthia had died "recently" ( nuper ) and had already been buried, but in a dream had instructed him regarding the epitaph she desired (Prop. 4.7.81-86). 12 1.Perinthos 282 (Perinthus region, Thrace; first/second century A.D.).

To the Manes of Thetis, who lived nine years, and her sister Charis, who lived fifteen years. Their father, Tiberius Claudius Panoptes, made this in compliance with a dream, along with their mother Charmosyne. You who read this and doubt the Manes to exist, having made a bet, invoke us and you will know. Likewise, (this monument is to) their tutor and fellow freedman Eunus.16 In contrast, the few other tombstones belonging to this group were not commissioned by close family members - a fact which, rather significantly, shows that friends and associates of the dead also occasionally believed themselves to have been visited in dreams by spirits of the deceased and to have been obligated to act on their instructions.17 These funerary inscriptions demonstrate a belief that the dead could appear in dreams and com- municate to the living in word or gesture, and that the living took these dreams seriously: after all, if the dream-visitations they alluded to were simply considered by the dreamers to be the products of their imaginations, the recipients would have had no reason to record their dreams on tombstones.18 As is particularly explicit in the epitaph referring to the Manes of the two sisters, these inscriptions therefore show that the notion of the dead visiting the living through dreams was not a literary con- ceit but rather a genuine religious belief found among both the Greeks and the Romans: and, just as gods were believed to appear in worshipers' dreams regularly and issue requests or instructions, which likewise were denoted epigraphically by such language as хост' övocq and ex viso , spirits of the dead were believed to communicate through the same medium and evidently to make requests in 16 CIL 6.27365 + add. p. 3918, cf. Supplita!, Imagines I, no. 54 5 (= ILS 8201 a) (Rome; ca. A.D. 50-100). 17 These tombstones are as follows: a Latin epitaph believed to be from Velitrae that was commissioned by a freedman for his patron ex viso (H. Solin, Supplltal n.s. 2 [1983] , 59-60, no. 30; Imperial period); a Latin epitaph from Rome for a liberta cryptically stating that it was commissioned ex viso nutríeis , an ambiguous phrase that could refer either to a dream in which the wet nurse herself, also deceased, had appeared on behalf of her ward, or a dream received by the nutrex and acted upon by her or the dead libertad patron or parents (CIL 6.3413 + add. p. 3845 [= ILS 8203]; Imperial period); and, another Latin epitaph from third-century A.D. Rome that records the pontifex and praetor designatus Quintus Pompeius Falco Sosius Priscus ( PIR 2 6, P 603) consecrating a funerary monument for his great-grandfather, the former consul and "founder of his house" ( domus suae conditor ) Quintus Pompeius Sosius Priscus (PIR2 6, P 656), who almost certainly had died decades earlier, before the birth of the descendant who was honoring him with a completed or expanded burial site (CIL 6.1490 + add. pp. 3805, 4705 [=1151106]). A related phenomenon might be alluded to in a com- memorative stele (axVjXri piveíaç) from Egypt stating that an unnamed individual acting on the orders of Isis ([х]ат' èmiay^v | xrjç xuçíaç 0eãç | "IaiÔoç) had erected it in honor of a man named Nemesion son of Anebotion, who had built her a shrine featuring a cistern and garden (SEG 47, 2147 [= I. Varsovie 61]; A.D. 91). The term èmiayri must refer to a dream or oracle, and if the former was the case, this inscrip- tion would represent unique evidence for an individual dreaming that a divinity had sought honors for a deceased person - either by appearing direcdy to the dreamer or send- ing a dream-messenger - instead of that individual appearing in a dream himself or herself. 18 Such a sentiment, which happens to echo closely the refer- ence to the Manes on the tombstone of Thetis and Charis, is to be found in the opening line of Propertius's poem recounting a visit from Cynthia's ghost in a dream: "So there are indeed Manes ; death does not end it all" (Sunt aliquid Manes; letum non omnia fuit ) (Prop. 4.7.1). A very different point of view is expressed by Lucretius, to whom the "images of those bereft of light" (simulacra luce carentum) that appear in dreams are merely simulacra (i.e., eiÔoAa in Epicurean thought) and are not manifestations of the dead themselves (Lucr. 4.26-44). These tombstones attest to the fact that Lucretius's belief was not universally held.</page><page sequence="6">164 GIL H. RENBERG a similar manner on occasion. In the eyes of many, these spirits were merely divinized as the Dii Manes or 0sol xaiaxOóvtoi (either individually or collectively, according to the different beliefs), but sometimes they were considered minor divinities - called rfecoeç or 0eoi in their epitaphs and other sources, regardless of whether they had a formal hero cult and whether they had been prominent citizens19 - and, evidendy, both types could send or appear in dreams. Thus this small group of funerary inscriptions provides a unique insight into the belief held by many that the dead would become semidivine and could even communicate directly in the same manner as divinities. In some cases, the dead communicated not just in the same manner as divinities but to announce that they had become divine. Most notably, in contrast to the majority of these inscriptions, which generally appear to have pertained to the need for a proper funerary monument, an inscription recorded by a man named Epikrates in northwestern Lydia during the early Imperial period states his belief that his recendy deceased son Diophantos had been visiting him repeatedly because he wished to be the focus of a new hero cult that his father would establish and endow.20 According to his inscription, known as the "Testament of Epikrates," he had been prompted to act "not only by devotion to my child, but also by dreams, signs and apparitions of the hero himself before me, vis- ibly and repeatedly appearing" (lines 33-35, oò pióvov xaxà i^v cpiXóisxvóv jxou 7içoaÍQeaiv, àXkà | xaì òveÊQoiç xaì arjfxsíoiç xaì cpavxáafAaaiv aòxou [xoi toõ ffetooç | èvaçywç rcoXXáxiç èmcpoiTwvioç).21 Similarly instructive are two metrical inscriptions from an Egyptian tomb recording the divinization of a girl named Isidora, who appears to have drowned in the Nile sometime in the second century A.D., though a precise date is not known.22 Painted on the wall beside the door leading into her burial chamber at the Touna el-Gebel necropolis near Hermoupolis Magna, the approximate site of Antinous s own drowning death, the epigram begins by expressing the resolution of one of her parents no longer to mourn while making sacrifices to her, since it has become evident that she is now a divinity: oòxéxi croi [xéXXto 0ÓSIV, 00уа[т££, [лет] à xA,[a]u0|ioõ, | èÇ ou gyvwv cbç Oeòç èÇsyévoi).23 The rest of the epigram reveals that the nymphs had played a role in her divinization and that she herself was to be called 19 See Jones 2010, 48-74, surveying the phenomenon and effectively demonstrating that while sometimes the dead were referred to as heroes more out of custom than religious conviction, the term often did reflect survivors' beliefs. Examples of ordinary individuals being termed "hero" or "god-hero" include the epitaphs for Gamikos and Venerianus discussed above. As Cicero's plan to enshrine his deceased daughter Tullia by constructing a fanum shows, this belief was not a purely Greek phenomenon (Cic. Att. 12.18.1 [= 254, ed. Shackleton Bailey]; see Shackleton Bailey 1966, with additional references). 20 Herrmann/Polatkan, Testament 1, cf. Malay, Manisa Mu- seum 20 (mod. Bakir, near Nakrason; ca. A.D. 1-50?). This lengthy document was inscribed on two steles, one of which is lost. The surviving stele, the second of the pair, preserves eighty-two lines on the front and thirty-four on the back, beginning with an itemization of the shrine's properties and annual donations to the fiscus (lines 1-26), then demarcates the land belonging to the cult (lines 26-40), and concludes by detailing at length the various cult regulations, adminis- trative rules, penalties for violation, and responsibilities of Epikrates's heirs (lines 41-116). 21 As is shown by a passage in Artemidorus's Oneirokritikon , Epikrates's experience does not appear to have been unique: oí "Hçœeç xaì aí 'Hçwíôeç xoîç 0eoTç xòv aòxòv ^ouci Xóyov 7tM|v öaov ôuváfxewç ánoXeínovmc xaì yàç xà áyaôà xaì xà xaxà jjxxova arjpiaívouCTiv. àsi 8è oí (xèv хатгцреТд xaì Xixói xaì [aixqoì pXe7tó(xsvoi ar)[ia{voi&gt;aiv "Hçwaç 7iA,y]aíov xfjç tou íôóvxoç olxíaç ÍÔ£U(xévotjç fjxot áxeXiaxouç p] xeXexfjç ôeofiévooç] fj rcçóç xivœv ópQiÇojAévooç xaxaxexwafxévooç, oí&gt;ç áveuçóvxa xeXéaai xaì xtjiãv. ("Heroes and heroines have the same import as gods [i.e., when appearing in dreams], except insofar as lacking force- for they indicate matters both good and bad, but less so. Whenever they are seen with downcast expressions, unadorned, and slight, they indicate that near the house of the one seeing them there are heroes present who surely are unworshiped, or have been subjected to outrages by certain people, or have been covered with earth [i.e., not given proper burial], whom it is necessary for the one discovering them to worship and honor") (Artem. 4.78). While Artemi- dorus was not referring specifically to dreams of deceased family members, he nonetheless attests to the establishment of hero shrines in response to dreams. 22 Comparisons between Isidora's death and that of Anti- nous have been made occasionally (e.g., Kuhlmann 2002, 205-206). 23 1.Hermoupolisl8 + pl. 33 (= Bernand, Inscr. métriques 87).</page><page sequence="7">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 165 "nymph" and worshiped as such, while an accompanying epigram written on the opposite side of the door claims that the nymphs, including the Nile nymph Nilo and the one who in mythology seized Hylas, had constructed her burial chamber, adorned it with decorative elements associated with a nymph grotto, and established it as a shrine (teçóv) - all implicit though inconclusive evidence that Isidora had drowned in the Nile.24 Information conveyed by the first epigram that is especially note- worthy is that the father or mother somehow came to learn that Isidora had become a goddess, and this knowledge was not gained immediately following her death but after an unknown period of time had passed (as indicated by oòxéit). Unfortunately, the nature of this revelation is not indicated, but a dream must certainly be considered a strong possibility.25 Even if not in a dream - and the "Testament of Epikrates" shows that "signs and apparitions" were alternative means of communication for the dead, as they were for gods - this parent thought that he or she had received a revelation, leading to the belief in Isidoras fate being cause for celebration rather than lamentation.26 As the Isidora epigrams appear to show, sometimes dreams of deceased loved ones had the effect of comforting the survivor instead of simply motivating him or her to erect a funerary monument, establish a new hero cult, or undertake some other obligation to the dead. This, too, is shown by literary sources, going back to the Classical period: as Admetus tells Alcestis when they are discussing her imminent death, "Perhaps you might gladden me by frequenting my dreams; for it is sweet to look upon dear ones even in the night, for whatever amount of time there might be" (èv 8' òveígaaiv I cpoiTwaá 'L9 sòcpçatvoiç ôcv t^ôù yÒLQ cpíXooç | xdcv vuxxl Xeóaaeiv, övtiv' ôcv raxQfj xqóvov).27 A much more elaborate example of such thinking is to be found in a model courtroom speech by Ps.-Quintilian, in which he spins a tale of a mother who had been receiving regular visits at night from her recently deceased son until her husband hired a sorcerer to cast a spell on the tomb and restrain the spirit, leading her to prosecute her spouse for his cruelty. As part of his strategy, her lawyer attempts to gain sympathy for the aggrieved mother: 24 1.Hermoupolis 77 + pl. 32 (= Bernand, Inscr. métriques 86). On these epigrams, see in particular Eitrem 1937 and Hani 1974. For the belief that drowning in the Nile could lead to divinization as a minor god known as a hsy (plural hsy.w; transcribed in Greek as éaifjç), meaning "glorified" (i.e., divin- ized) and sometimes "glorified through drowning," see below. Étienne Bernand is more hesitant than most previous scholars to conclude that Isidora's death occurred in this manner based on such indirect evidence (Bernand, Inscr. métriques , p. 345 and I.Hermoupolis , p. 170, cf. p. 172; see also Kákosy 1982, 295). A roughly contemporary funerary stele from Saqqâra for a young girl or boy named Asklepias that refers to him or her as éaifjç is often cited as a potential parallel, though the manner of death is uncertain ( LGrÉgLouvre 71). To this can be added two inscriptions from the Roman period published more recendy: a funerary stele for a ten-year-old girl named Syria, who is identified as a éat (SEG 45, 2121), and one for a female éoír] identified as a mother-in-law, which shows that this term was not limited to the young (SEG 46, 2 170, no. 7 1). (As the latter two inscriptions, both clearly for females, employ the term without a sigma , it appears likely that Asklepias was a boy and that this noun had both masculine and feminine forms.) Quaegebeur may be correct in linking an individual named Apion to this phenomenon on the basis of his funerary stele referring to Apion having been "consecrated in this place" (èvOáôe dccpié^wToci), but this could refer to his having become heroized rather than a hsy (Quaegebeur 1977, 135 n. 31 on I.Fayoum 24 [= I.Prose 48]). The extent to which Greeks in Egypt may have distinguished between heroes and hsy.w, however, is not indicated by surviving sources. Moreover, in this particular case a different interpretation is also possible: though Pierre Jouguet compared Apion to Isidora as a divin- ized mortal (Jouguet 1935, 227-233) and was followed in this by André Bernand in I.Prose , Étienne Bernand has argued that the use of ácpiéQwxai means that Apion had consecrated an area rather than becoming consecrated himself. 25 That ëyvojv might be interpreted as a reference to a divine revelation, perhaps through a dream, was suggested by Sam- son Eitrem (Eitrem 1937, 317) and Arthur D. Nock (Nock 1960-1961, 305 n. 2 [= Essays 2:925 n. 27]), and accepted by Étienne Bernand ( I.Hermoupolis , p. 172). 26 Bernand rightly sees this belief in Isidora's divinity as a reflection of Greek religious attitudes toward the afterlife rather than Egyptian ( I.Hermoupolis , p. 172). See also Eitrem 1937, 3 16, noting two funerary epigrams from Rome for girls snatched away by the nymphs ( IGUR 3.1344, 1350), as well as other parallels. 27 Eur. Ale. 354-356. Such a welcome encounter stands in contrast to the more abundant sources from Classical Greece for unhappy or angry spirits requiring propitiation or some other action (see, e.g., Johnston 1999; 2005).</page><page sequence="8">166 GIL H.

I would hardly be speaking incorrectly in saying that she rather sparingly engaged in lamenta- tions and tears, and that her sorrow did not permit her to mourn one who was visiting her. But now she has been deprived of this comfort and robbed of this very convincing experience Not from the contrivance of some vain fancy or mournful thoughts was a shade visiting her, nor was this á trivial apparition disturbing her unsetded sleep, and not even a face of one rendered indistinguishable by the unhappy embers and a head sprinkled with ash was coming on those nights. But rather, it was her son, in the same way he had formerly been, both youthful and handsome in appearance. Nor was he content only to be looked at and seen, but if you believe anything at all with respect to this pitiable woman's object of yearning, who alone has seen him, then he was giving her embraces and kisses and come alive for the whole night.28 To Admetus, Alcestis's death will be easier to bear because there at least remains the prospect of dream-visitations; to this fictional mother, her son's death is even harder to bear because the hope of such visits has been destroyed. The epigraphical record preserves parallels for this and the other examples from literature of those who recently had died visiting their loved ones at night to give comfort.29 A close parallel to the situation presented in this forensic speech is to be found in two lines from an epigram inscribed at a family burial site in Kyzikos, in which the deceased describes his mother weeping at his tomb and then states, "I lighten her suffering for as much time as I am present in her dreams, but the dawn brings tears instead of joy" (xoixpiÇco 8è xáXaivav, öaov %qóvov eíç övocq fjxwi, | ô'àvxi %a qôcç ôáxQua noQôùe xai).30 There are also inscriptions expressing a wish to see a loved one in a dream or dreams. For example, an epitaph from Rome includes a woman's prayer that the Manes will permit her to receive visits from her deceased husband at night: Animae sanctae colendae I d(is) M(anibus) s(acrum). I Furia Spes L(ucio) Sempronio Firmo I coniugi carissimo mihi.

For a blessed soul that is to be cherished, (I consecrate) a sacred thing for the divine Manes. Furia Spes, to Lucius Sempronius Firmus, my most dear spouse: Well I know how as a boy and girl we were bound equally by love, and with him I shared my life for the shortest time, and in that time when we ought to have lived together we were separated by a wicked hand - so I entreat you, most sacred Manes , to preserve my dear husband who is entrusted to you, and to be willing to be generous to him during the nighttime hours so that I am able to see him, and also 28 Ps.-Quint. Deci. 10.1. 29 Deborah Felton rightly observes that in literature, "dream- ghosts are almost invariably spirits of the newly deceased, for whom grief would be fresh, rather than of those who have been dead for many years" (Felton 1999, 19). This also appears to be true of those referred to in the epigraphical sources, with the apparent exception of Quintus Pompeius Falco Sosius Priscus (n. 17). 30 1.Kyzikos 1 518, lines 13-14 (= Steinepigramme 2.64-66, no. 08/01/51 = I.Varsovie 16).</page><page sequence="9">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 167 that he (you?) should be willing to convince Fate that I, too, might reach him rather pleasantly (i.e., painlessly?) and quickly.31 Similarly, in a metrical epitaph from third-century A.D. Tarraco a wife expresses grief over the loss of her husband (possibly a legionary veteran) and poetically calls upon him to appear in her dreams: Manes si saperent, mise'ram me abducerent con'iugem. Vivere iam quo I me ? Lucem iam nolo vi'dere. I Dulcem carni lucem, cum te I amisi ego, coniunx. Has tibi I fundo dolens lachrimas, dulcis'sime coniunx. Lachrimae si pro'sunt, visis te ostende videri. If the Manes were discerning, they would carry me off, his wretched spouse. What purpose is there now in living? I now no longer wish to see the light. For I was deprived of the sweet light when I lost you, husband. These tears I, grieving, pour out for you, sweetest spouse: if tears are any help, present yourself to be seen in my dreams.32 A funerary epigram from Smyrna begins with mythological allusions to Alcyone and Niobe lament- ing the loss of their children and then expresses this mother s grief over the death of her daughter and desire to see her in a dream: (b xácps xal ôaípiwv, jjuxqòv [ié0eç tç (páoç èX0eîv | 7caîôav èfxVjv IlauXav, ôoîç 8é [xoi etaiô&lt;é&gt;eiv | o5 aoi Oeçascpóvr) tóôe [Aéfj^exai oùôé xi a' *A8r]&lt;ç&gt; (vel xiç 'Aôrj?) | fjv TÓaov ANTHIEEL (= àvTrjar]ç?) 7iaîôa èpn^jv хост' övocq.

For this neither Persephone nor Hades will reproach you at all, if for such a short time you permit me an encounter (?) with my child in a dream.33 In each of these cases, as with the literary sources, the mourner's wish reflects a belief that the deceased loved one still existed in some form after death, and thus a visit from him or her would represent more than an imaginary experience.34 Other inscriptions, rather than merely expressing hope for such an experience, report dream- visitations from deceased loved ones whose stated intention was to give comfort. Most notably, a 31 CIL 6.18817 + add. pp. 3523, 3915, cf. Supplita I, Imagines I 84, no. 108 (= ILS 8006). The unusual treatment of the Manes as feminine in line 9 is most likely an error, as is indicated by the use of the masculine plural indulgentissimi for the same divinities. While noting the traditional interpretation, Keith Bradley has suggested that Furia and Lucius had been slaves and that the "wicked hand" that separated them was that of the owner who sold one of them (Bradley 1987, 69), but this is hardly likely, especially since elsewhere manus mala is associated with being touched by witchcraft (Petron. Sat. 63 ; Plaut. Amph. 605; cf. CIL 6.19747 [= ILS 8522], Eripuit me saga manus crudelis), and the nomenclature of husband and wife does not suggest servile or freed status.

For the difficulties presented by lines 9-10, which do not impact this discussion, see the commentaries in these two most recent editions. 34 To this group might be added a fragmentary funerary inscription from Carthage in which the words somnis fre- quentiam are preserved, suggesting a similar prayer for the deceased to appear in dreams {CIL 8.13265 [= CLE 135]).</page><page sequence="10">168 GIL H. RENBERG sophisticated 46-line funerary epigram from Rome that reveals the influence of such poets as Vergil, Propertius, and Ovid details the visit of a deceased individual named Marcus Lucceius Nepos to his in-law Sextus Onussianus Com[- ] just before dawn, evidently in a dream so vivid that the recipient claimed, "This was not the effect of sleep, but rather his complexion and voice were real" [non fuit illa quieSy sed verus iuveni color et sonus ).35 After describing the nature of this encounter, the narrator recounts the consoling words uttered by the departed, urging him not to mourn because, rather than having ended up in the Underworld, he had been raised to the "glorious realm of heaven" {caeli lucida templa ): Adfinis memorande, quid о me ad sidera caeli ablatum quereris?

Cease your weeping for a god, so that your loyal affection, ignorant that I have been received into the celestial abode, does not put you in mourning and your sorrow afflict a divinity. For I shall not sadly descend to the Tartarean waters, nor as a shade be carried across the Acheronian depths, nor propel by oar the dark vessel, and I shall not fear you, Charon, terrifying in appearance, nor will ancient Minos pass judgment on me or in the funereal places shall I wander, and I will not be hemmed in by the rivers. Arise, bear tidings to my mother that she should not night and day bewail me, as the mourning Attic mother does Itys. For holy Venus has ordained that I know nothing of the silent ones' abode and has brought me into the glorious realm of heaven. A comparable situation is evident in a 16-line funerary epigram from Lydia, though severe damage to the stone prevents the reading of a related epigram on another side. The poem represents the deceased, a girl or woman who had been killed by lightning, speaking to her mother in a dream and saying that she had come to comfort her: [a]òxòç Zeòç Kçovíôrjç | [0ф](£иуод cdbègi vaíwv | [a]¿)[ia 71UQÌ (pXéÇaç aié^vcav | èÇeíXaxo 6u[ióv oòx fjji I [rjv] Pqotóç- t0ò 7caQéax[r]v] | [jijrjxéQi aspivf) vuxtí I pteXatvotátr) éQfir]ve[ó] | ouaa xáô' oíkwç* "[Afjxsfe] I MeXixívr], Oçfjvov XÍ7te, | roxõe yóoio, 35 CIL 6.2 152 1 (= CLE 1 109 = Courtney, Musa Lapidaria , no. 183) (Rome; Imperial period).</page><page sequence="11">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 169 t|&gt;i&gt;Xr)ç fAvr]a[a] | [jivr], fjv jioi Zeòç xeçmx[éç] | auvoç xeóÇaç áOáva | xov xaì ày^çaov %axa | [я] avia âQTzácÇaç èxópLi[a] | fa'] eíç oòçavòv áoisQÓ | [ev]xa." High-throned Zeus Kronides himself, dwelling in the ether, having burned up my body with fire, took away the life from my breast. But I was not mortal. Right away, I appeared to my venerable mother in darkest night, stating the following: "Mother Melitine, leave aside lamentation, stop your mourning; remember my soul, which Zeus who delights in thunder, having made it deathless and ageless for all days and taken hold of it, has conveyed to starry heaven."36 While no doubt influenced by literary accounts, such narratives show the importance of dreams that conveyed messages of comfort in helping some individuals to cope with their grief.37 Indeed, consoling grief-stricken survivors by reference to the heavenly destination of their loved ones soul appears to have been a common approach, as other sources indicate. It is employed by Seneca the Younger in his essay consoling Marcia on the loss of her father and son, in which he echoes Stoic beliefs in the soul's association with the divine fire, stating that Mareias son s soul had been welcomed by the Scipios and Catos along with her father and that grandfather and grandson now enjoy an existence moving among and mingling with the stars.38 Such a belief is found in several epitaphs, among them a third-century A.D. inscription from Massalia (mod. Marseilles) that attributes to the deceased sailor, who communicates from beyond the grave in the first person, the claim that 36 ТАМ 5.2, 1 108л (= Steinepigramme 1.418-419, no. 04/05/07) (Thyateira, Lydia; undated). It is possible, based on a mention of the funerary monument (arjjjia) in the other epigram ( ТАМ 5.2, 1 108&amp;, line 23), that this dream, like the ones noted above, had the effect of prompting the mother to erect a tomb. 37 In addition to these funerary texts, it may be that an unusual dedicatory inscription from Knidos records a dream intended to bring comfort to a mother mourning her daughter, if a recent reinterpretation is correct {I. Knidos I 131 [= Steinepigramme 1.9, no. 01/01/06], cf.

For Kore and Demeter, Chrysina, mother of Chrysogone and wife of Hippokrates, erected a shrine and statue having seen a holy nighttime vision. For Hermes told her that her daughter was serving the revered (?) goddess. The first three lines present no problem, but the fourth line has created much uncertainty because some of the letters clearly inscribed on the stone, ©EAIZTA0NHI, form just one recognizable word, 0e&lt;xi or 0eaTç. Previous readings have assumed that the first five letters should be read as 0eocTç, with a second word, TaOvrji, representing an unknown toponym where the two goddesses were to be served. Instead, however, Kent J. Rigsby has argued that these letters refer to a single goddess who is described as ae^vfji - a reading that assumes a stone-cutting error - and that this last line records a dream in which Hermes, fresh from the Underworld, is reporting to a grieving mother that her daughter has attained a special status in the afterlife as a member of Persephone's retinue (Rigsby 2003). Even if Rigsby s emendation is wrong - perhaps instead Stathnë might be a transliteration of an indigenous term - his overall interpretation could still be viable: in addition to some of the inscriptions and literary sources that record comforting reports of how deceased individuals were faring in the afterlife, two brief literary passages provide further support. The closest parallel appears in a statement by the chorus in Euripides's Alcestis , that the play's heroine will "serve as an attendant the bride of Hades" and receive rewards for her virtuousness after she dies (el ôé xi xáxeř | 7iXiov Ucn* áyocOoTç, xoúxcov [lexé^oua' | "Aiòou vúficpy] 7iaçeÔQ£Óoiç) (Eur. Ale. 744-746). Unlike this statement and the texts that specify what the deceased was experiencing in the afterlife, Aelius Aristides took a different approach, writing that after the death of Zosimus, one of the servants who had raised him, "A vision came to me from the Underworld gods, that if I should let go my excessive griev- ing for the deceased, it would be to my benefit" (&amp;{nç jaoi yiyvexai nagà xwv ^Oovícov 0ec5v, s! xò acpóôça oîkco A.tmeîo0ai èm xoîç xeXeox&amp;aiv áveírjv, auvoíaeiv ¡jloi èm xò péA/uiov) (Arist. Or. 49.47; see Behr 1968, 8-9). Though providing no details about his father's place in the Underworld, this passage supports Rigsby's suggestion that a mourner could be comforted - or, in this case, instructed to put grief aside - by receiving a dream-communication from an Underworld god instead of the deceased loved one himself or herself. 38 Sen.

Overall, it is noteworthy that for some mourners much comfort was obtained simply from the belief that the deceased had returned to them and been present for a time, but for others it was news that the deceased was faring well in the afterlife and had even achieved a special status - sometimes that of divinity- that consoled them.42 3. Hadrian and the Divinization of Antinous: A New Theory It is possible to see in Hadrian's reaction to the death of Antinous a situation comparable to some of those revealed by these sources - but instead of learning only that Antinous was faring well, he 39 IG 14.2461, lines 13-18 (= IGF 10); see Boyancé 1952, 326-327. 40 Men. Rhet. 2.9, p. 414.16-27. Goukowsky 2002, 229-231 speculates that Menander may have had in mind the lost Aôçiavùj roxça[jLu0r]Tixòv elç Avrívoov of Noumenios. For a speech in which such an approach was taken, see Aelius Aristides s commemoration of a deceased pupil from Kyzikos named Eteoneus, in which he imagines a god speaking and comfort- ing the citizens with the thought that the promising youth had become a hero and shared the company of the eponymous divinity Kyzikos (Arist. Or. 31.15, 18; see Jones 2010, 62-63). 41 Some examples of epitaphs are collected in Courtney, Musa Lapidaria , pp. 382-383 and Jones 2008, 201-202; cf. Seiter 2010. To these can be added two funerary epigrams from Rome placing the deceased among the Isles of the Blessed: a short epitaph for an otherwise unknown girl named Aelia Protia commissioned by her father ( IGUR 3 . 1 146; see Cairon 2006) and a lengthy poem for Regilla, wife of Herodes At- ticus, that was composed by the poet Marcellus of Side on a commission from the famous sophist, in which she is said to dwell with the heroines in these islands, and it is specified that she has achieved a status superior to that of deceased mortal but inferior to that of goddess ( IGUR 3 . 1 155 + add. 4, p. 164; see Jones 2010, 62). The related matter of who among the dead would be granted access to the privileged area of the Underworld is discussed in Chaniotis 2000. 42 The latter type of situation might lie behind an epigram from Mantineia, one of the main centers of Antinous worship outside of Egypt (see n. 47), recording that a youth or child named Isochrysos had become divine through the interven- tion of Antinous himself: Aó^rjç roxTôoc 'IaóxQDcrov, öv Avxívooç 0eòç aòiòç ijeaTO cpiXáfxevoç oúvôqovov áOaváxoiç, elxóvi xabte(r) xeó&amp;xç 'Emxóvxavoç Iv0a rcatôa 7caxVjQ Ofjxev ÔÓYfxaxi xfjç na tqíôoç. Isochrysos, son of Doxa, whom the god Antinous himself, loving him, raised up to be seated among the deathless ones: Epitynchanos his father, having made a likeness of this child in bronze, set it up in this place with the approval of his fatherland. (IG 5.2, 312) Although the inscribed statue base does not state this, Isochrysos appears to have been considered a hero, and his father claimed that this had occurred through the active in- volvement of Antinous. If this claim was not fabricated, there is a possibility that Epitynchanos had learned of his son's heroization and Antinous's role by means of a dream. (See Jones 2010, 81, writing that "Isochrysos' father at Mantineia imagines [Antinous] raising his late son to be 'seated beside' the immortals." On this epigram, see also Goukowsky 2002, 235-236, needlessly associating it with the mysteries of An- tinous, and Robert 1980, 135, suggesting that the statue was privately erected in the sanctuary of Antinous itself.)</page><page sequence="13">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 171 learned that his cherished companion had become a hero or god. In his deep grief for the lost youth, it would have been perfecdy natural for Hadrian to dream of Antinous, and, as a man with clearly attested religious interests,43 Hadrian may well have believed that this was the divinized Antinous himself that had come to him - just as the individual in Rome declared through verse that he had received an early-morning visit from a kinsman who had become a deus , one of Isidora s parents quite possibly had seen the "nymph" in a dream, and Epikrates believed that he had envisioned his son, the hero Diophantos, on multiple occasions.44 In one or more of these dreams, Antinous would have announced that he had become a god or hero - in which manner Hadrian perceived Antinous is impossible to know - and merited worship as one, prompting Hadrian to set in motion the heroization and deification of Antinous.45 The youth s cult was to be centered at a temple in the newly founded city of Antinoopolis, where Antinous was worshiped as the god (or divinized mortal) Osirantinous (i.e., Osiris- Antinous) and his mortal remains were most likely entombed,46 but elsewhere in Egypt and beyond he was worshiped alternately as a hero or god.47 These requests for deification and for 43 In addition to building more than three dozen known temples and shrines and supporting numerous other cults and cult sites, Hadrian was an initiate in various mysteries and demonstrated the importance of religion to himself personally and politically in various other ways (see Beaujeu 1955, 111-278 and Kuhlmann 2002; for Hadrian's strong connection to Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries, see Clinton 1989). Although it is impossible to assess the degree and nature of Hadrian's personal religiosity (see Mortensen 2004, 296-304 for an overview of the debate), there is no reason to conclude that he was an atheist. 44 For the recorded dreams of Hadrian, see Weber 2000, 106-107, 199-200, 339-340, 386-388, 459; cf. Kuhlmann 2002, 44-50 et pass. The link between the death of Antinous and magical practices by Hadrian found in the accounts of Cassius Dio and Aurelius Victor, which might simply be ascribed to mere rumor, raises a correspondingly speculative alternative - that Hadrian engaged in divinatory rituals to summon a dream-visitation from Antinous. Though it has not previously been suggested that Hadrian received dreams featuring Antinous, Jones has come closest, putting the popu- larity of the Antinous cult in the context of the popularity of hero cults in general, especially those for divinized figures who appeared in dreams: "Reinforced by the belief that the young dead, even family members, could become 'good heroes' and visit the living in dreams and apparitions, a cult sprang up that became personal for more than the emperor, and lasted down to the fourth century" (Jones 2010, 82). 45 For what can be inferred regarding Hadrian's role in the spread of the cult, see n. 54. 46Calderini, Diz. geogr. 1.2, 88-89, 91 collects the sources for this temple. The Egyptian name of the Antinoeion may have been "Power of Osiris-Antinous, justified" (or "Well- being of Osiris-Antinous, justified"), as seems indicated by a phrase in the text inscribed on the obelisk that honored this divinity (see below). Grenier, despite noting that Dimitri Meeks had suggested to him that the line in question pro- vides the temple's name rather than the divinity's, opts for the latter, traditional interpretation (Grimm, Obelisk §IVc [= §Id, Grenier]; see Grenier 2008, 12 n. b). However, as noted by Alexandra von Lieven, "Osiris" {Visir) is preceded by a w^s-scepter, which does not clearly appear at other points where this name is written, suggesting that it formed a distinct word and therefore supports the conclusion that the passage refers to the temple itself (pers. comm.). Thus whereas Grenier, who does not address the issue in his com- mentary, may have believed the w^s-scepter to be a phonetic complement rather than a word, there is a good likelihood that it should be read as part of the temple's name and that his transliteration of rn=fr Wsir-'ntynws-mf-hrw should be replaced with rn=fr wjs- Wsir- 'ntynws-mj '-hrw. Possibly cloud- ing this issue, however, as von Lieven also recognized, is that there might also have been a w^s-scepter in the pyramidion text referring to Antinous above this passage: included by Erman with some hesitation following the reading of Georg Zoëga (Erman 1917, 44, citing Georg Zoëga, De Origine et usu obeliscorum ad Pium VI. P.M. [Rome 1797] pl. 7), this sign was adopted by Grenier without any indication of un- certainty, even though the surviving trace is different from the one appearing farther down. Therefore, it is possible that the w^s-scepter could have been used as part of the god's name here, but since this reading is so uncertain, it is not grounds for rejecting the conclusion that the passage in which the sign is clearly discernible does refer to the temple's name. (I am grateful both to von Lieven for drawing my attention to this complex problem and to Franziska Naether for further clarifying the issue.) For the problems associated with the site of Antinous's burial, which may instead have been in Italy, see the appen- dix. Regardless of where Antinous's tomb was, his worship at Antinoopolis as Osirantinous would have been qualitatively different from the manner in which he was worshiped be- yond Egypt in a number of respects, since at the other sites he was a more conventional Greek or Roman divinity (on Osirantinous, see below). 47 The issue of whether Antinous was worshiped as a hero or god at sites other than his Antinoopolis temple is a some- what complicated one, made so by the fact that both are</page><page sequence="14">172 GIL H. RENBERG at least one cult site would appear to be the oracula - or among the oracula - that the Vita Hadriani attributes to Hadrian.48 The Vita's use of the verb componere seems to imply that Hadrian himself fabricated the oracles and circulated them under Antinous s name, and since oracles were typically written in verse and Hadrian was a capable poet in both Greek and Latin, this is certainly possible.49 However, if Hadrian received one or more dreams in which the deceased Antinous communicated oracles to him, he likely would have been able to quote these from memory verbatim upon awakening or rework them into proper form before sharing them with others: therefore, if these oracles were com- posed by the emperor, they need not have been viewed by him or his contemporaries as fabrications.50 Support for concluding that the oracula were issued in dreams can be found in some simple logic: for Antinous to have been issuing oracles he had to be divine, but the Historia Augusta appears to indicate that he was deified because he was issuing oracles, and the only way out of this chicken- or-the-egg paradox is to recognize that a dream-oracle attributed to the spirit of a deceased person well attested in the sources. While the Greek coins issued between the death of Antinous and that of Hadrian, includ- ing at least two issues from Alexandria (Geißen, Kat. Alex. Kaisermünzen 1275-1282; cf. Meyer 1991, 146-147, no. 3 + pl. 19), primarily refer to him as hero, he was also honored as a god at Ankyra ( SNG France III 2444 + pl. 132) and at his native Bithynion (Waddington, Ree. gén. 1.2, Bithynium nos. 13, 14, 15, 17; cf. Meyer 1991, 147-148, no. 4 + pl. 116), where a dedicatory inscription likewise identifies him as a god (I.Klaudiupolis 56: véwi Oe¿j[i] | Avtivóoh | eò^v | Eù)o6évr][ç]). (For Antinous on Greek coins in general, see Blum 1914, esp. 67-70; Meyer 1991, 135-151; Leschhorn, Lexikon I, p. 42; for those issued at his native Bithynion, see W. Weiser in I.Klaudiupolis, p. 157; von Mosch 2001; Nollé 2004. See also Mambella 2008, 98-103 for a set of high-quality color photographs of Antinous coins. There are no coins for Antinous minted in the Latin West.) As was the case at Bithynion, Antinous was honored as a god at its mother-city Mantineia, the main center of Antinous worship in Greece, as is clearly indicated by Pausanias (Paus. 8.9.7), a public inscription referring to Antinous as the 0eòç èmxiógioç (IG 5.2, 281), and the epigram honoring a youth named Isochrysos (quoted n. 42), while the only possible evidence for his being considered a hero there is the appearances of horses, which were sometimes associated with heroic iconography, on the reverse of some Mantineian coins (see Jones 2010, 59). It has been argued by Alessandro Galimberti, who points to just two coin issues of A.D. 133/134 and 134/135 referring to Antinous as a hero and then the well-known inscription for a funerary collegium of Diana and Antinous at Lanuvium from A.D. 136 in which Antinous is implicidy recognized as a god ( CIL 14.2112 [= ILS 7212]), that Antinous was initially heroized and divinized only after A.D. 135 (Galimberti 2007, 143-144). This conclusion, however, cannot be accepted because it misuses the numismatic evidence, in addition to not considering much of it: not only are most of the relevant coin issues naming Antinous as hero or god undated, but at Alexandria, origin of one of the issues he cites, there was also an issue calling Antinous a hero in A.D. 136/137, which undermines his claim. Instead of Galimberti's hypothesis, the conclusion reached by Jones, that in some cities Antinous was worshiped as a hero and in others as a god, is undoubtedly correct (Jones 2010, 75-83). (In the case of Bithynion, two undated coin issues referring to Antinous as a hero suggest that even in his native city there was some flexibility in how he was to be perceived [Waddington, Ree. gén. 1.2, Bithynium nos. 16, 18; Jones 2010, 80 refers to Mantineia as the city where both forms of divinity appear on Antinouss coinage but undoubtedly meant Bithynion]. The existence of these "hero" coins might have been used to support Galimberti's thesis, but they are undated.) 48 Meyer previously concluded that these oracula pertained specifically to the honors Hadrian gave Antinous at his new city rather than being more general in nature (Meyer 1991, 196). While the term oraculum most commonly was used for a divine communication obtained through some form of divination at an oracular shrine or sanctuary, it also was used occasionally by Latin writers to refer to dream-oracles (e.g., Apul. Met. 11.7 and 11.13; Cic. Div. 1.32.70; and Macrob. In Somn. 1.3.8). It is, of course, possible that the author of the Vita Hadriani was unaware of the source of the oracles and used this term without realizing that they were dream- oracles. After all, Hadrian might not have widely publicized the nature of the impulse that led him to determine that Antinous had become a god. 49 Ancient sources for Hadrian as poet include Cass. Dio 69.3.1 and SHA Hadr. 14.8-9, 16.1-4, 25.9-10. See André 1993, 602-611 for an overview of Hadrian's poetry, as well as Goukowsky 2002 on the emperor's dedicatory epigram to Eros- Antinous found at Thespiai {IG 7.1828 [= I.Thespies 270]). It is probably not a coincidence that the author of the Vita Hadriani wrote of Hadrian's skills as a poet immediately following his mention of the rumor that Hadrian had com- posed these oracles. 50 As still happens today among poets and songwriters, in antiquity poetic works of various sorts could be composed in dreams: see, e.g., Arist. Or. 50.45-46, regarding a couplet that Aelius Aristides inscribed on a dedication for Zeus along with an explanatory statement that he had composed the poem in a dream.</page><page sequence="15">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 173 would have represented sufficient grounds for establishing the deceased as a hero or god, who then could begin to issue oracles to any and all.51 Further support for this interpretation appears to be preserved in the Armenian version of Eusebius s Chronicle , which indicates that Antinous was dei- fied due to an unspecified divine revelation: "Antoninus (sic), a certain companion of the king, died in Egypt and because of a revelation was honored as a god."52 This passage, derived from a work that most likely predates the Vita Hadriani , emphasizes the link between Hadrian's divination and Antinous s divinization. Similarly, the grieving Hadrian's declaration that he had seen "a certain star of . . . Antinous" (áaxéQoc xtvà ocòtóç те ógãv (bç xai тои Avxivóou övt a 'é^eye), which his companions as- sured him had "come into being from Antinous s soul" (£x те Tfjç тои Avtivóou òvtwç tòv ácrégoc yeyevfjaQai), certainly would seem to indicate that he was receptive to detecting signs of Antinous 's immortality in other ways as well.53 Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether the revelation referred to by Eusebius was an oracle issued by Antinous - in which case Eusebius 's work and the Vita Hadriani might have shared a common source - or the star, or else an otherwise unrecorded divine communiqué, but since the star was not direcdy linked to the establishment of Antinous 's cult in surviving ancient sources but the oracula were, the first appears to be the more likely expla- nation of this source. Overall, these sources argue against the assumption of some that Hadrian decided to pronounce Antinous a god simply because he had the desire and authority to do so: on the contrary, the better assumption is that the emperor would only have determined that Antinous was a god or hero because he had received a divine sign (or signs) and perhaps had confirmed the authenticity of the message he had received by consulting a local oracle or diviners. Following this, Hadrian appears to have played a role - albeit an indeterminable one - in the establishment of the Antinoopolis temple and the cult's spread throughout the empire.54 Within a relatively short period 51 Goukowsky, lacking any reliable evidence, argues that the temple of Antinous at Mantineia housed a major oracle that functioned by means of consulting verse oracles similar to the Sibylline Oracles and proposes that this passage in the Vita Hadriani might allude to their composition in Egypt by priests of Antinous operating under the supervision of Hadrian (Goukowsky 2002, 234; on Mantineia, see n. 47). 52 Eus. Chron. 2: 166,226g Schöne: Antoninus quidam re- gius in Egipto mortuus est et propter revelationem ut deus honoratus est (quoting H. Petermann's Latin translation of the Armenian version, on which see Mosshammer 1979, 73-79 et pass.). 53 Cass. Dio 69.11.4; for other ancient sources regarding Antinous 's star, see Goukowsky 2002, 228-232; cf. Grenier 2008, 54. The possibility that an allusion to this star is to be found in the inscribed hymn to Antinous from Kourion has been argued by Goukowsky, who restores the epithet yXoyiùiióq, ([- ]QIIA on the stone) in one of the damaged lines (Goukowsky 2002, 220 n. 23, on I.Kourion 104, line 16 [cf. SEG 53, Il Al bis]). Such a belief in Antinous's catasterism has an obvious parallel in the comet that Octavian associated with the divinized Julius Caesar in 44 B.c. (see Ramsey and Licht 1997, with ancient sources). 54 Hadrian's precise role in establishing Antinous as a divinity is not recorded, but that it was significant may be inferred from a range of sources, as well as from the fact that he had actively supported other hero cults during his reign (see Boatwright 2000, 140-142, noting that such activities would make his support of Antinous's cult less anomalous). The most direct evidence comes from Hadrian's Villa, where the discovery of statues of the divine Antinous reveals an implicit belief in his divinization. If the speculation that Hadrian played a role in drafting the text of the Monte Pincio obelisk is correct, it would also indicate an active role in shaping the cult (see n. 75). Later sources also attribute Antinous's divinization to an impulse from Hadrian: in addition to the passage in the Vita Hadriani stating that "the Greeks, in fact, deified him following Hadrian's wishes" (SHA Hadr. 14.7; cf. Cass. Dio 69.11.4), it is perhaps alluded to by the vague statement in one of the Sibylline Oracles that "He (Hadrian) will reveal a child to be a god" (roxíôoc 0eòv ôeixvóasi) ( Or.Sib . 8.57; cf. 12.166) and is more clearly stated in a later work by the fifth-century Christian writer Theodoret of Cyrrhus (Theodoret, Affect. 8.28). Even though just one ancient source, Pausanias's statement that Hadrian established the worship of Antinous at Mantineia (ó ßamXeug хатеат^стато aòxw xai èv Mavxiveíqc xipiáç) (Paus. 8.9.8; see Jones 2010, 78-79, suggesting the same was likely the case at Bithynion), direcdy attests that Hadrian actively promoted this cult at a particular city outside of Egypt, a wider role is certainly pos- sible. The extent to which he would have actively encouraged the cult's spread beyond Antinoopolis, however, is unclear, especially since, as argued by Jones, at several cities the cult is known to have been promoted by prominent citizens with personal connections to the emperor, and these individuals</page><page sequence="16">174 GIL H. RENBERG of time Antinous became the most widely worshiped hero of the Imperial period and the only one known to have had mysteries.55 4. The Egyptian Context of Antinous' s Divinization Antinous 's death and subsequent divinization through a funerary cult established near the site of his drowning have been thought by some to correspond to the Egyptian tradition, appearing to date at least as far back as the late Pharaonic period and known to some degree by both Herodotus and Tertullian, that some (or all) of those who drowned in the Nile River would become a type of divinized mortal known as a hsy (plural hsy.w) and the focus of a cult centered at his or her tomb.56 Although the manner of Antinous 's death might not have been relevant to his divine status, it ap- pears that he is referred to as a hsy at two or three points on the obelisk that most likely served as his funerary marker but was found in the sixteenth century near Rome's Porta Maggiore and today stands on Monte Pincio.57 Regardless of whether the term has been correcdy read in the obelisk, might have been doing so "as an act of respectful consola- tion" and because they were aware of his wishes, rather than because they had been directly asked (Jones 2010, 80-81). Thus cities that determined to venerate Antinous as a hero or god might have been complying with a directive from the emperor but would not necessarily have required such a direct external impetus to do so. Either way, the cities of the Roman East would not have required a decree of the Roman Senate to begin worshiping Antinous as divine (as was done for emperors and members of the imperial family), and in the case of those cities at which Antinous was considered a hero rather than a god official deification by the Senate is out of the question, as the Senate played no role in the establishment of hero cults. Nor was there a need to receive authorization from the Senate to deify Antinous according to Egyptian practices and establish his worship at Antinoopolis (see Boatwright 1987, 251). 55 The point is that of Jones 2010, 81. 56 Hdt. 2.90 (with commentary by Lloyd 1975-1988, 2:366-367); Tert. DeBapt. 5.4 (with commentary in Schleyer 2006, 174-175). Whereas Herodotus shares anecdotal evidence that may or may not have represented widespread beliefs, Tertullian simply states that "those whom water has killed are called . . . esietii" ( es[i]etos . . . vocant quos aquae necaverunt ), employing a Latinization of the Greek term for hsy. The definitive study on divinization through drowning (and other means) is Rowe 1940, but see also Quaegebeur 1977 (with additions and corrections to Rowe's list of divin- ized individuals at p. 135). While some have considered the term hsy to apply only to those whose apotheosis was linked to drowning, mounting evidence has indicated that this manner of death was not required for the term to be applied, and thus rather than necessarily meaning "glorified through drowning" it could also simply mean "glorified" (see Quaegebeur 1977, 138-140; for Greek examples from epitaphs postdating this work, see n. 24). Either way, it ap- pears to have been a phenomenon particularly associated with the young and prematurely deceased - a category to which Antinous belonged. For the previous association of this Egyptian tradition with Antinous's deification, see, e.g., Beaujeu 1955, 242-248 and Hani 1974, 219; cf. Boatwright 1987, 251 and Birley 1997, 248-249. Just as not every deceased individual who was identified as a "hero" in the Greek world was the focus of a cult (see n. 19), it appears that not every hsy/émfjç had a cult site either, as is indicated by the Greek epitaphs applying this term to the deceased. In contrast, the famous Augustan-era Temple of Dendur at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art honored the brothers Peteêsis and Paüris, who therefore would be the most prominent representatives of the hsy phenemenon (see Rowe 1940, 22-25; Quaegebeur 1977, 141). The rock-cut funerary sanctuary of the hsy Piyris at Aïn Labakha in the Khargeh Oasis might serve as a more informative parallel, however, since on the walls of this well- preserved site have been found more than two dozen Greek and Demotic graffiti, four of which refer to him as 0eóç, that include proskynema texts and references to being saved by him in some unspecified manner (see Hussein 2000 for the sanctuary; the Greek inscriptions are SEG 46, 2087-2 109 [cf. SEG50, 1601], republished in G. Wagner, "Les inscriptions grecques," in Hussein 2000, 69-89). Though limited to local worshipers, the cult of the god Piyris clearly thrived among both ethnic Greeks and native Egyptians, showing that the worship of hsy.w was not limited to the latter. 57 On the obelisk and its text, see Iversen 1968, 161-173; Boatwright 1987, 239-259; Derchain 1991; Meyer 1991, 169, 175-178; 1994b (esp. Kessler 1994); Ciampini 2004, 168-187 et pass.; Grenier 2008; Mambella 2008, 75-88; cf. NTDAR , "Obeliscus Antinoi," p. 272 and J.-C. Grenier, LTURy "Obeliscus Antinoi," 3:335. See also Winter 1997, using the obelisk as indirect evidence for the circumstances of Antinous's death. The obelisk's references to the empress Sabina, who died in A.D. 136, provide a terminus ante quem , though a date closer to Antinous's death is preferable. For the issues associated with the obelisk's origin, see the appendix.</page><page sequence="17">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 175 the traditional belief in hsy.w may have had the effect of helping Hadrian to "sell" local Egyptians on Antinous 's divinization,58 though there is reason to think that this was not a particularly suc- cessful endeavor.59 However, Antinous 's designation as a hsy would not necessarily have convinced Greeks or Romans of his divinity;60 and furthermore, since it is not clear that this belief in divin- ization through drowning in the Nile was widespread in Egypt, it might not even have influenced most Egyptians. Oracles attributed to the deceased announcing that he was to be honored as a god, however, would have found a more receptive audience among both Egypt's Greek population and the peoples living in other parts of the Roman Empire: and, as the "Testament of Epikrates" and passage from Artemidorus cited above show, dream-oracles issued by spirits of the dead seeking divine honors were recognized as a legitimate reason to establish a new cult.61 The empirewide wor- ship of Antinous, who was honored with temples, statues, dedications, games, and even mysteries, (N.B.: Both Grimm, Obelisk and Grenier 2008 provide full texts and commentaries, but Grenier has renumbered two of the four sides of the obelisk, swapping sides I and IV instead of adhering to the traditional order for reading the monu- ment. Although, unless otherwise noted, I am reproducing Grenier's transliterations, I am citing passages in the obelisk according to Grimm's edition, as that is a full edition that in- cludes complete facsimiles and photographs. Grimm follows the numbering system established in the previous standard edition, that of Adolf Erman, which is now outdated [Erman 1917, 10-17,28-47].) While the standard reading of the seated male god deter- minative Hieroglyph found at the beginning of §§IIa and Ilia has been ntr ("god"), Franco Crevatin opted for hsy based more on the circumstances of Antinous 's death than a linguistic argument (Crevatin 1995, 11-12). He has been followed in this reading by Grenier, who also wishes to apply this reading to the beginning of another passage, likewise based on parallels with other hsy.w who died accidentally (Grenier 2008, 8 n. a , on §Ia [= Grimm, Obelisk §IVa]; cf. Grenier 2008, 64-65, a discussion of the hsy Antinous having been distinct from others because he was a universal divin- ity of superior status). According to Alexandra von Lieven (pers. comm.), elsewhere in the text there is some support for this reading: there is reference to Antinous taking his place among the "able spirits" (ijhwiqr.w) of Osiris 's retinue (§IIe), indicating that he was among the blessed dead who were practically divine; he is referred to as being worshiped by the religious personnel and ordinary worshipers of Egypt "like a god" (mi ntr) (Grimm, Obelisk §IVa [= §Ib, Grenier]), an odd and un-Egyptian turn of phrase, when normally "as a god" (m ntr) would be expected for a divinized mortal; and the awkward statement that Antinous "is known for having become a god in the 'abatons' of Egypt" (rh.tw=fr ntr m ij.wt ntr.ywt n.(w)t Km.t ) earlier in this passage can also be read, "He was recognized in view of the god of the 'abatons' of Egypt," which would make Osiris the god and Antinous either a particular favorite of Osiris or his hypostasis (§Ib, Grenier; quoted n. 123). Further clouding the issue, however, is the fact that elsewhere in the obelisk text - in the passage apparendy providing the Egyptian name of the Antinoeion (Grimm, Obelisk §IVc [= §Id, Grenier]; see n. 46) - Anti- nous is clearly referred to as a "god" (ntr). Thus while it does appear that Antinous was viewed as a hsy, there was some degree of flexibility that permitted him to be called a god as well - just as the Greeks alternately considered Antinous a god and a hero, and sometimes even as both at the same site (see n. 47). 58 For other elements of Egyptian piety evident in the wor- ship of Antinous at Antinoopolis as revealed by the Pincian obelisk, see Kessler 1994, 124-129 et pass. (In her review of Meyer 1994b, Katja Lembke dismisses the significance of such elements as evidence for the obelisk's origin at Antinoo- polis by pointing to the pair of obelisks from Beneventum as a comparison, but the Hieroglyphic text on these two obelisks does not feature a comparable level of specific theological content [Lembke 1995, 110; Hieroglyphic text in Erman 1896; commentaries and translations in Müller 1969, 10-11; Iversen 1973 ; and RICIS 505/0801] . See the appendix for the issue of where the Monte Pincio obelisk was first erected.) 59 That the worship of Antinous caught on among Egypt's Greek-speaking population is attested by numerous papyri featuring the theophoric name Philantinoos ("To whom Antinous is dear"), a name that would not exist if people did not consider Antinous divine (see NB, 462, s.v. "OiXavxívooç" and Onomasticon , 330, s.v. "OiXavxívooç"). In contrast, no examples of a comparable name are to be found in Demotic, suggesting less of an interest in the worship of Antinous among ethnic Egyptians. Since very few of the Egyptians - let alone Greeks - who saw the obelisk would have been able to read its Hieroglyphics, it must have had a minimal impact, either way. 60 Members of the Greek-speaking population of Egypt itself would have been much more receptive to the notion of Antinous having become a hsy than Greeks living elsewhere since - in addition to the graffiti for the hsy-0eóç Piyris - three Greek funerary inscriptions attest to the belief in hsy.w among this population by identifying the deceased as one (see n. 24), while many other Greek inscriptions and papyri reveal theophoric names derived from this term (see Wagner 1998). Outside of Egypt, however, this was not recognized as a distinct category of divinity. 61 Seep. 164.</page><page sequence="18">176 GIL H. RENBERG argues for the eventual widespread circulation of the oracula referred to in the Historia Augusta.® However, the immediately intended audience for these oracles of Antinous is likely to have been the Greek-speaking population of Egypt, for it was in Egypt that Hadrian initiated Antinous 's deifica- tion and the establishment of a Hellenic city, Antinoopolis, near the site of his death.63 Thus the first "Graeci" who received the oracles and began to worship Antinous accordingly were those living in Egypt - especially in the area of Hermoupolis Magna, the city closest to Antinoopolis - and soon thereafter word of these oracles would have spread to Greece and the rest of the Roman Empire.64 It remains an open question, then, whether the divinized Antinous would have been recognized by the Egyptian population as a hsy just as the Greek world alternately termed him heros and theos (and Latin speakers deus), but it is certainly possible that Antinous 's apotheosis had its roots in both the Greek and Egyptian traditions and that Hadrian's impulse led to a blending of the two.65 Another reason to conclude that the oracula were originally dream-oracles is that the Hiero- glyphic text on Rome's Monte Pincio obelisk, the funerary monument for Antinous that is likely to have originated in Antinoopolis at his temple around the time that the cult site was established, praises Antinous for sending therapeutic dreams to ailing worshipers, showing the god's propensity for communicating in this manner: šm-n=fm ijt=fr gs[w-prw s?Jw n tj dr=fhr sdm-n=fnh(t) nt(y) s n=fsnb-n=fmhr iwtyw m hyb n=frs.wt.

"holy place") to the numerous temples of the entire land, and he hears the appeals of those who invoke him and heals the sick among the needy poor by sending a dream.66 62 For the spread of Antinous's cult beyond Egypt, see Boatwright 1987, 251-258; Birley 1997, 253-256; Jones 2010, 75-83; cf. Meyer 1991, 188-211, 251-253, 261-262. Of particular note is that there was a mystery cult at Man- tineia attested by Pausanias (Paus. 8.9.7-8), and possibly one at Antinous's native Bithynion as well (see Robert 1980, 132-140 and Goukowsky 2002, 233-239 et pass. , basing their conclusions partly on l.Klaudiupolis 65). 63 The Monte Pincio obelisk specifically refers to either "Truppen" of Greeks (Grimm) or a "population" of Greeks (Grenier) who had come from all over Egypt to Antinoopolis, along with Hellenized Egyptians, and were rewarded with land grants (Grimm, Obelisk §IVb [= §Ic, Grenier]; see Grenier 2008, 10-11 and Grimm, Obelisky p. 82). On Antinoopolis, which already had citizens by A.D. 133, see Zahrnt 1988; Kes- sler 1994; Boatwright 2000, 190-196; cf. Calderini, Diz. geogr. 1.2, 69-114 (+ suppl. 4, pp. 16-17), s.v. "AvnvooÚ7ioXiç." See also Grenier 2008, 57-58, arguing that the drowning did not occur at Antinoopolis, but that the site had been chosen for pragmatic reasons some years earlier, and in the aftermath of Antinous's death this event was turned into a foundation myth and the city was named for him by Hadrian. 64 It is necessary to question the conclusion that this passage in the Vita Hadriani indicates that Antinous first became an oracular god in Greece, or at least functioned as one there (see, e.g., Beaujeu 1955, 253; Boatwright 1987, 251; Gou- kowsky 2002, 234). The first Greeks to hear of Antinous's revelations were almost certainly those in Egypt, while there is no reliable evidence for his having issued oracles from a cult site in Greece (see n. 73). Also, the author's emphasis on the Greeks believing in Antinous's oracles should not be taken as an indication that this belief was limited to the Greek East - rather, it should be considered a subde disparagement of the Greeks by the Latin-speaking author. Antinous's cult is well attested in the Greek East within two years of his death and in the Latin West within three, which undermines the implication in this passage that he was dei- fied in Greece and Asia Minor but not Italy and the Latin- speaking provinces, which would also have received word of the oracles. Moreover, Hadrian returned to Rome in A.D. 132, no doubt bringing the worship of Antinous with him a year before the first datable evidence, if it had not already been established there. In general, scholars have wrongly treated the cult of Antinous as more of a Hellenic phenomenon, but as Boatwright correcdy shows, he also became well rooted in the Latin West (Boatwright 1987, 253-258). 65 Kuhlmann has previously noted that the Antinous cult is significant because it fit into Egyptian and Greek (and to some extent Roman) cult (Kuhlmann 2002, 209). Some of his other arguments in this section regarding Antinous's divinization, however, are based on antiquated studies of Greek religion (Kuhlmann 2002, 206-210). 66 Grimm, Obelisk §IIIc (with commentary); cf. Kessler 1994, 145 and Grenier 2008, 25.

However, while there is no particular reason to doubt that Antinous was among the divinities of Egypt believed to cure people through dreams - or, at least, that an attempt was made to represent Antinous as a healing god so that he would be more quickly accepted by potential worshipers - it might be best to view the claim that this was happening all over Egypt with at least some skepticism.68 After all, Antinous is praised in the obelisk text as "Osirantinous," indicating that at the temple most closely associated with the site of his drowning Antinous was worshiped as an incarnation of Osiris, a phenomenon typical of the divinized dead in Egypt and closely associated with their burial place.69 Nowhere else is Antinous known to have been worshiped as Osirantinous,70 and only at Antinoopolis is there clear evidence - in the form of a passage in Origen 's famous polemic against the traditional religions of the Roman Empire a century later - of this Greço-Egyptian god having issued oracles or, possibly, worked healing miracles.71 Thus at Antinoopolis, where the cult of An- tinous had significant Egyptian elements that cannot be detected elsewhere,72 the new god would have been communicating to worshipers by sending dream-oracles - some, though not necessarily all, on health-related matters - but at other sanctuaries and shrines, especially outside of Egypt where he was a more conventional Greco-Roman divinity rather than "Osirantinous," there is no evidence for his having done so. Likewise, literary sources suggest that at his main sanctuary Antinous might also have been issuing oracles through some form of divination involving prophetes , but the following consultation with Terry Wilfong, to whom I am grateful for his insights. Wilfong has also made the interesting suggestion that the reference to "the needy poor" - iwtyw, a term common in Egyptian autobiographical narratives in the context of the subject having shown his generosity to the have-nots - might have been read as "those without (means to pay a doctor)" (pers. comm.). Grenier, however, interprets this passage as referring to Antinous giving care to the needy and sick as two distinct groups: "il prodigue ses soins au malade et à l'indigent." The replacement of mr, which appears in Grenier's and earlier transcriptions, with mhr in this text is based on Joachim F. Quack's recent study of this combination of signs (Quack 2003). This change does not alter the meaning, however. (I am grateful to Heinz-Josef Thissen for drawing my attention to this issue.) 67 See below. 68 In another section, a comparable claim is made that Antinous was being worshiped in shrines built for him all over Egypt (Grimm, Obelisk §IVa [= §Ib, Grenier]; quoted n. 123), which Grenier somewhat implausibly takes to be a reference to shrines linked to Osiris and other divinized mortals (Grenier 2008, 9 n. b). It is also best to be skeptical of Grenier's claim that the use of the epithet epiphanes in a dedication by the epistrategos of the Thebaid should be taken as an indication that Antinous would manifest himself before his worshipers, since this common epithet was employed in reference to gods who in some manner had a manifest im- pact on people's lives, without necessarily being envisioned (Grenier 2008, 64, citing 1. Portes 2). 69 For the association of Antinous with Osiris, which was limited to Antinoopolis and thus can be compared to the wor- ship of Osorapis (i.e., Osiris- Apis) at the Saqqâra Sarapeum, see Kessler 1994, 132-133, 141-146 and Grenier 2008, 7; cf. Meyer 1991,245-247. 70 Statues of Antinous in an Egyptianizing form are said to represent "Osirantinous," and that convention is maintained in this article. Such images stand in contrast to Antinous's frequent identification with other gods and mythological fig- ures, such as Apollo, Belenus, Dionysus, Ganymede, Hermes, Hylas, Meleager, and Narcissus, outside of Egypt (see Meyer 1991, pass.; Voisin 1994; Kuhlmann 2002, 220-236). Repre- sentations of Osirantinous found beyond Egypt, such as the colossal statue found at Tivoli (see n. 94), should be viewed as an artistic type rather than as evidence that he was worshiped in the same manner as at Antinoopolis. 71 Origen, С. Cels. 3.36. The passage refers unambiguously to "so-called oracles" (ôoxoõoou jxavxeiai), but it is possible to infer from the context that there was also a tradition of healing miracles at Antinoopolis, though this is uncertain. Royston Lambert misleadingly claims that there is evidence for priests of Antinous at the site pronouncing oracles by means of a hollow statue, when the archaeologist whose work he cites, Giovanni Uggeri, merely speculates that a hole at the back of a broken statue of Antinous that was used for transporting and positioning the statue might have served such a secondary purpose (Lambert 1984, 186; Uggeri 1974, 131-132). Similarly, Kuhlmann 's conclusion from Origen that there was an oracle at Alexandria should be discounted (Kuhlmann 2002, 137-138). 72 See n. 58.</page><page sequence="20">178 GIL H. RENBERG evidence for this having been the case elsewhere is inconclusive at best.73 Moreover, the scene atop the obelisk's north side, in which Osirantinous faces Amon, appears to feature text attributing to the latter the pronouncement that he is giving the new god the power to issue oracles (shr), which would indicate an oracular function at Antinoopolis, though there is too little information for the term's use in this context to be certain of its intended meaning.74 But the possibility of obtaining dream-oracles from Antinous is especially noteworthy because it provides further reason for as- sociating the oracula of the Vita Hadriani passage with the cult center at Antinoopolis: Hadrian is believed to have played a role in composing the obelisk's lengthy text, which praises both the emperor and the new god extensively and was partly funerary in nature, and the reference to many others receiving dreams from Antinous might have been intended to emphasize the authenticity of the emperor's own experiences and the dream-oracles he had received.75 Regardless of whether he was one of those who drafted the text or simply gave his approval before the obelisk was inscribed, at the very least it appears likely that Hadrian intended for the passage in question to encourage a belief in Antinous as a divinity who regularly interacted with the mortal world through dreams. As was true elsewhere in the Roman East, worshipers in Egypt believed that a number of gods were issuing dream-oracles, so Antinous would have been far from unique. Of particular relevance was Imhotep, a top royal official under the pharaoh Djoser (reigned ca. 2667-2648 B.c.), who after his death came to be venerated as a god and who by Roman times had long been issuing oracular and therapeutic dream-oracles. Similarly, another divinized pharaonic official, Amenhotep, had been installed at Deir el-Bahri in the early Ptolemaic period and was issuing dream-oracles at the site.76 The Egyptians, therefore, were preconditioned to associate not only certain traditional gods 73 The main reason to conclude that Antinous was an oracular god who employed a medium other than dream-divination is the evidence for prophetes in his cult, but the sources at- testing to this are limited and problematic. Eusebius quotes a passage from Hegesippus associating prophetes with the cult and implying that they were at the Antinoopolis temple (Hist. eccl. 4.8.2), as does Jerome (De vir. inlustr. 22; quoted n. 103), which is the strongest evidence. In contrast, the dedication from Rome's Iseum Campense that was given by a prophetes to a god believed to have been Antinous should not be relied on as evidence for anything more than the pres- ence of prophetes at Rome's main Egyptian sanctuary, where they more likely served Isis (IGUR 1:98 = RICIS 501/01 17). Similarly, the passage in the Monte Pincio obelisk usually translated as referring to Antinous 's being venerated by "prophets and priests" does not represent evidence of his oracular nature, as the Egyptian terms hm-npr. w and w b.w represent two grades of priests, with hm-ntr not necessarily indicating a divinatory function (Grimm, Obelisk §IVa [= §Ib, Grenier]; cf. Meyer 1991, 246). Moreover, as Grenier notes, these priests would have been serving a variety of cults (Grenier 2008, 9). Overall, while it is possible that in the cult's early days there were multiple sites at Egypt where Antinous issued oracles through official diviners, the likeliest interpretation of the evidence is that his oracular function was always limited to Antinoopolis, where it continued at least until the time of Origen. (Kuhlmann, in a brief comment, righdy noted that it is unclear whether Antinous had an oracle anywhere other than Antinoopolis, but this has been a minority view [Kuhlmann 2002, 201].) Outside of Egypt there is no evidence for Antinous having been an oracular god, as is occasionally claimed. The reasons espoused by Goukowsky for concluding that Antinous had an oracle at Mantineia are completely unconvincing: based on the Vita Hadriani reference to Greeks receiving oracles from Antinous, he claims that the prominence of the Man- tineia sanctuary makes it an obvious place for an oracle to have existed. He goes on to cite Hadrian's reputed interest in Vergilian verse oracles (SHA Hadr. 2.8) as grounds for engaging in the wild speculation that consultations at this sanctuary would have involved verse oracles composed in Egypt under the inspiration of Antinous, whom he un- justifiably associates with the oracular god Hermes-Thoth (Goukowsky 2002, 234). 74 See Grenier 2008, 19; cf. Kessler 1994, 134. (This text is omitted from Grimm's edition.) 75 For Hadrian's likely involvement, see Derchain 1975, 808; Derchain 1991, 110; and Birley 1997, 255. Derchain has speculated that the author of this text, or the one adapting Hadrian's Greek or Latin words into Hieroglyphics, can be identified as a religious official named Petarbeschenis, who is known from another stele, but this seems far from certain (see Derchain 1987, 23-32 et pass.; Derchain 1991, 120). On the authorship, see also Kessler 1994, 148-149. 76 On Imhotep and Amenhotep, see Wildung 1977a; 1977b; Lajtar, Deir el-Bahari.</page><page sequence="21">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 179 such as Thoth and Isis with dreams but also certain divinized mortals. Similarly, in the Greek world a number of divinized mortals from the mythic past communicated through dreams, most notably Asclepius and Amphiaraus, but there is also evidence for a belief in the oracular dead in the Greco- Roman world that perhaps hints at a more widespread phenomenon than the surviving sources would indicate. In addition to some literary sources,77 an especially noteworthy inscription is found on a small funerary altar erected for a priestess of an unidentified cult at Thyateira in Lydia. According to this text, the priestess, named Ammias, could be invoked by those seeking dream-oracles: "If anyone wishes to learn the truth from me, let him pray at this altar for what he wishes and he will obtain it through a vision, either by night or by day" (et tlç ôè Oétai то &lt;Ш] 1 0èç piaOeTv rcaçà èfxoõ tç xòv ßco I [xòv èveu^áaôw | ö ôtv 0éXei xaì èm | теб^етои ôià ó | çáfxaxoç vuxtòç | xaì T^fxéçaç).78 Such an inscrip- tion demonstrates that the Greeks believed some individuals in death gained an oracular function, as was the case with Antinous. And, in the case of this priestess, whose altar and sarcophagus were given by "the children and mystai of the gods" (xa Téxva xai oí piúaTai tcõv 0ewv) in her memory, it is tempting to speculate that her oracular powers were first recognized by someone who received a dream in which the recendy deceased priestess revealed that a funerary cult associated with dream- oracles was to be established for her - not unlike what might have happened with Hadrian and the establishment of Antinous as a god who, according to the Monte Pincio obelisk, became known for communicating to worshipers through dreams. A belief in the oracular dead was likewise firmly established in Egypt, as can be seen not only in the cults of divinized mortals such as Imhotep and Amenhotep but also the "Letters to the Dead" phenomenon of the Pharaonic period - including the well-known "Letter on a Stele," in which a dream is sought - and Demotic literature, while in late antique Egypt both Athanasius and Shenute criticized those who slept at tombs to obtain oracles.79 Therefore, when the cult of Antinous was established, this divinized youth's reputed abil- ity to issue dream-oracles would have found acceptance, since both native Egyptians and those of foreign origin living in Egypt had long believed in the ability of mortals who had become divine to communicate in this manner. 5. Conclusion Whether explicitly or implicidy, a number of those who have commented on the divinization of Antinous have tended to treat this unusual episode as an example of a broken-hearted autocrat taking advantage of his absolute political power to rather self-indulgently promote his former lover to the ranks of the divine - a rash and troubling act more worthy of Caligula than the learned and pious Hadrian. However, as this new interpretation of the Vita Hadriani and examination of potential comparanda reveal, Antinous s elevation to the rank of hero and god was somewhat less 77 Cicero, for example, tells a story of Simonides burying a corpse he had come across and then receiving a prophetic dream in which the deceased individual appeared and warned him against undertaking a sea voyage on a ship that did indeed sink (Cic. Div. 1.2156). A curious tale, attributed to Nymphodorus of Syracuse, is told by Athenaeus, who recounts the establishment of a Chian hero cult devoted to a runaway slave who had led a slave revolt and who in death would appear to the Chians to warn them of their slaves' conspiracies (Ath. 265C-266E; I am grateful to Sara L. Forsdyke for this reference). 78 ТАМ 5.2, 1055, lines 9-16; undated. 79 For various practices from the Pharaonic and post- Pharaonic periods that involved some form of necromancy, see Ritner 2002.

When viewed in the context of beliefs concerning the afterlife and that the dead could still communicate with the living, and especially the limited but clear evidence that the recendy deceased were sometimes thought to inform a surviving loved one that they should be worshiped as a divin- ity, it becomes clear that the worship of Antinous may have been less of an anomaly than has been believed. Similarly, Hadrian's experience and actions might better be considered as representative of a well-attested religious phenomenon, albeit on a grander stage than usual. Indeed, the process of establishing Antinous among the divine appears to reflect a blending of three traditions: the belief evident among the Greeks and Romans that deceased loved ones would communicate to mourning survivors through dreams, especially in the period soon after their deaths; the Greek custom of recognizing some among the dead as divine and establishing hero cults in their honor, occasionally as the direct result of communications in dreams; and the Egyptian beliefs that certain mortals who died prematurely through drowning or from some other cause would become minor local divinities known as hsy.w and that some divinized mortals such as Imhotep regularly issued dreams as well as oracles conveyed in a different manner. If so, the establishment of Antinous as a new god and hero by or with the encouragement of the philhellene Hadrian may reflect a combination of Greek, Ro- man, and Egyptian religious traditions to a greater extent than previously recognized. Whether this was deliberate on the part of Hadrian would depend on his familiarity with the Egyptian traditions, but since part of his visit to Egypt involved exploring local religious traditions, and he was quite possibly acquainted with the relevant passage in Herodotus, it appears quite likely that Hadrian was consciously - or unconsciously - appropriating a longstanding belief when he determined that Antinous should be worshiped as divine. Thus the original impulse leading Hadrian to establish Antinous as a divinity, most likely one or more dreams, was Greek in nature, but the execution was imbued with Egyptian elements - and adopting elements of Egyptian culture was a very Greek and Roman thing to do.</page><page sequence="23">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 181 Appendix On the Identification of the So-called Antinoeion at Hadrian's Villa, the Origin of the Monte Pincio Obelisk, and the Location of Antinous 's Tomb The place where the Monte Pincio obelisk was first erected and the related question of where Antinous was entombed have been the subject of considerable debate, with different points in Rome or else the Canopus area at Hadrian s Villa, located roughly 16 miles northeast of Rome, having gained the most support over the years.80 Even though in 1955 Jean Beaujeu had tentatively proposed Antinoopolis as the site for both Antinous s burial and the obelisk itself, this view was all but ignored until Mary T. Boatwright and later Dieter Kessler argued in its favor.81 A few years later, the issue was reopened by archaeologists Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti and Zaccaria Mari, who decided while working at Hadrian's Villa that the obelisk did originate there after all but not at the Canopus: instead, a complex discovered in 1998 and excavated over three seasons (2002-2004) was identified with Antinous and his obelisk, and this prompted them to argue that the tomb likewise had been there.82 Most recendy, the Egyptologist Jean-Claude Grenier has produced a new mono- graph on Osirantinous in which he rejects Antinoopolis, Hadrian's Villa, and his own previous work pointing to the Adonaea as the setting of both tomb and obelisk, instead suggesting Rome's Horti Sallustiani or possibly the Horti Domitiae, site of Hadrian s mausoleum.83 This proposal, based 80 Following more than a half-century of scholarship point- ing to a location in or just outside of Rome, Heinz Kähler, who earlier had accepted this consensus opinion (Kähler 1950, 155), argued in favor of Hadrian's Villa, suggesting the Canopus (Kähler 1975, 41-44). (According to Mambella 2008, 95, this was first proposed in 1842 by Luigi Ungarelli in Interpretatio obeliscorum urbis ad Gregrium XVI. P.M. [Rome 1842] 172.) A few years later, Niels Hannestad like- wise argued for the area of the Canopus at Hadrian's Villa as Antinous 's resting place and the obelisk's point of origin, interpreting the whole complex, including recendy excavated remains, as a memorial to Antinous (Hannestad 1982). Such claims were disputed by Mary T. Boatwright, mainly on archaeological grounds (Boatwright 1987, 148; cf. Coarelli and Grenier 1986, 221 n. 19, 230 n. 34). Though not delving into the physical remains as Kähler and Hannestad had done, Philippe Derchain likewise reached the conclusion that the tomb and the obelisk had been at Hadrian's Villa (Derchain 1975; cf. Derchain 1991, 110), specifically mentioning the Canopus in one work that appeared the same year as Boat- wright's refutation (Derchain 1987, 27). A new location in Rome was proposed just prior to this, when Filippo Coarelli and Grenier in jointly published studies pointed to the Pala- tine, suggesting the Adonaea as the specific site (Coarelli and Grenier 1986; cf. J.-C. Grenier, LTUR , "Obeliscus Antinoi," 3:335, F. Coarelli, LTUR , "Sepulcrum: Antinous," 4:274-275 and Z. Mari, LTUR: Suburbium, "Antinoi sepulcrum," 1:68). And, a decade after that, Claudia Paterna argued that An- tinous's tomb had been in the area of the Circus Varianus and that the obelisk was later moved to the circus and placed on the spina (Paterna 1996, 820-823; cf. С. Paterna, LTUR , "Circus Varianus," 5:237-238), in contrast to the theory that the obelisk was brought to the circus from Egypt (see next note). See Grenier 2008, 1-3 and Meyer 1994a, 14-20 for a further overview of previous scholarship. For sources on the obelisk as well as the approach to citing its text employed here, see n. 57. 81 Beaujeu 1955, 254-255; Boatwright 1987, 148, 239-260; Kessler 1994, 146-149 et pass.; cf. Malaise 2005, 115-117 and NTDAR , "Obeliscus Antinoi," p. 272, both supporting Antinoopolis as the site. Susan Sorek has reached the same conclusion in her general work on obelisks (Sorek 2010, 92-95). 82 Mari and Sgalambro 2007 summarizes the prior work on this subject, for which references are to be found below. See also Sgalambro 2003-2004, an important study devoted solely to the construction and architecture of the complex rather than a potential link to Antinous, and Sgalambro 2010, a similar piece that does briefly echo the arguments for that link (at pp. 410-411). 83 Grenier 2008, 42-44. On the Adonaea, see n. 118. The area of Hadrian's mausoleum was briefly identified by Derchain as a likely location for a monument to Antinous, but not specifically as the site for the obelisk itself, in his highly speculative and largely fictional study of the circum- stances surrounding the obelisk's preparation and erection (Derchain 1987, 5).</page><page sequence="24">182 GIL H. RENBERG partly on a passage in the obelisks text that possibly refers to gardens and partly on the presence of a Hadrianic complex and an Egyptian pavilion at the horti , is plausible despite being based on circumstantial evidence but only acceptable if Antinoopolis is ruled out.84 Overall, the dovetail- ing questions of where Antinous was laid to rest and where the obelisk was originally erected are highly problematic and more complex than some of the participants in the debate have recognized. Despite the difficult nature of the evidence, ultimately the arguments in favor of entombment at Antinoopolis - which are partly based on an overlooked patristic source - outweigh those in favor of any of the proposed sites in Italy, leaving the only reason for this obelisk's presence in Rome to be a matter meriting speculation.85 While earlier proposals placing the tomb and obelisk at the Canopus or one of several sites in Rome have been sufficiendy challenged,86 the claim that the recendy discovered complex at Hadrian's Villa - identified by its excavators as an "Antinoeion" - was the location for both requires further attention, especially since the claim appears to be gaining acceptance.87 Not only is this conclusion undermined by the arguments favoring Antinoopolis as the site for both, but careful examination of the evidence cited in its favor likewise calls it into question. The complex in question lies adjacent to the Cento Camerelle, a lengthy series of rooms used for lodging servants and slaves, and consists primarily of a large exedra located beyond two small temples flanking the entrance, with a temple- like structure at the back of the exedra. It was originally identified by one excavator, Salza Prina Ricotti, as Antinous's tomb, while Mari, working in tandem with her, was the first to use the term "Antinoeion" in print.88 Though initially tentative in her identification of the complex as the loca- tion of the tomb - and plausibly suggesting as an alternative that it was intended to commemorate Antinous but did not necessarily contain his remains89 - she subsequendy concluded that the Monte 84 Grenier had earlier linked the Egyptianizing site within the Horti Sallustiani to Caligula (Grenier 1989, 21-33). On this site, see below. 85 Further evidence of burial in Antinoopolis might have been found in the lead curse tablet from Egypt that is oc- casionally cited in studies of Antinous because it invokes the assistance of a corpse-spirit of someone who bore the same name, but this name was too common in Egypt for a reliable link to be drawn between the god Antinous and the corpse- spirit ( SupplMag 1.47 [= Gager 1992, 97-100, no. 28], with discussion of the name's frequency at 180 n. 3; cf. Nß, 35, s.v. "Avtívooç" and Onomast icon, 36, s.v. "Avtívooç"). Despite this, some of those discussing the tablet likewise have treated it as referring to Antinous (e.g., Merkelbach 2001, 113). 86 The lone exception is Greniers very recent suggestion of the Horti Sallustiani or Horti Domitiae, which has not yet received scholarly attention. 87 See, e.g., Opper 2008, 181 and Jones 2010, 76 (the latter exhibiting mild caution); cf. Pracchia 2006, 95, adopting the term "Antinoeion" without necessarily endorsing the identification, and Reggiani 2006, 65, considering a cenotaph more likely than a tomb. Some of my arguments regarding the so-called Antinoeion and the obelisk were anticipated by Grenier and Mambella, who were the first to challenge this identification (Grenier 2008, 40-42; Mambella 2008, 95-96). 88 Salza Prina Ricotti 2002-2003 ; Mari 2002-2003 . According to Mari, "After the first field season, it seemed possible to describe the structure (which was almost immediately named the Antinoeion) as a mausoleum or, perhaps, a cenotaph and temple. The second season, however, revealed a masonry foundation that may be connected to the famous obelisk of Antinous at Rome, which led us to interpret the structure as a true tomb housing the remains of Hadrian's paramour" (Mari and Sgalambro 2007, 83). 89 As Salza Prina Ricotti suggested, rather than being the tomb itself, this complex might have been an honorarium sepulcrum or honorarius tumulus , i.e., a funerary monument that, unlike a cenotaph, was erected when the person's body was buried elsewhere rather than lost (Salza Prina Ricotti 2002-2003, 138, citing Suet. Claud. 1.3 and Cass. Dio 55.2 on Drusus's being entombed in Rome while receiving an honorarius tumulus in Gaul). She also speculated that in- stead of subjecting Antinous to Egyptian funerary customs, Hadrian had him cremated and returned with the urn, before concluding that it will remain a mystery what happened to Antinous's body and whether it ended up at Tivoli - despite the fact that one ancient author makes specific reference to the corpse remaining at Antinoopolis (see below). In her next article, Salza Prina Ricotti instead speculated that Antinous's corpse remained at his temple until the complex at Hadrian's Villa had been prepared, at which point it was conveyed there with great celebration (Salza Prina Ricotti 2003-2004, 260).</page><page sequence="25">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 183 Pincio obelisk was erected at this complex, and thus Antinous was indeed buried there.90 Mari, who accepted these conclusions regarding the nature of the complex, provided additional supporting arguments based on sculptural remains,91 while in a later article he argued that the presence of a large, square concrete foundation between the temples, combined with other sculptural evidence, proved that the Monte Pincio obelisk had once stood there.92 More recendy, Mari has teamed up with Sergio Sgalambro to survey the results of the excavations at the complex, echoing the conclusions of his earlier work and that of Salza Prina Ricotti.93 While the excavation reports and other studies by the three are of great value and provide exemplary documentation and treatment of the remains that were unearthed at the complex, their conclusions associating it with Antinous and his obelisk and positing that the structure at the back of the exedra was the tomb itself are much less certain than their work admits, with the full range of evidence not having received proper consideration. Although the identification of the site as some sort of Egyptianizing complex is clear due to the sculptural and other remains unearthed in the recent excavations, its identification as an Antinoeion is based mainly on the belief that the Monte Pincio obelisk originated there, along with statues of Osirantinous found elsewhere at Hadrian s Villa over the centuries.94 Therefore, the very conclu- sion that this site was devoted to Antinous, while plausible in light of the evidence for Hadrian populating his villa with multiple images of the deceased youth and possibly converting one room into a small shrine,95 is not supported by any definitive evidence. Moreover, the arguments of Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti that the tomb of Antinous itself was located within the complex are no less problematic. Some of these arguments are based on iconography: for example, Mari sees significance in the compositional similarities between a partly preserved relief found at the site and a scene on 90 Salza Prina Ricotti 2002-2003; 2003-2004, 253-261. Though making no reference to the obelisk in her first article, in the second she speculatively links the obelisk to the site based on its possible reference to gardens (see below) and the presence of a tomb garden at the complex. In reaching this conclusion, however, Salza Prina Ricotti does not engage with any of the earlier scholarship on the subject of the obelisk's origin and Antinous 's burial, though she does dispute the arguments placing the tomb at the Canopus (Salza Prina Ricotti 2002-2003, 126-129, 136-137). 91 Mari 2002-2003, 181-183 ; 2003-2004, 303-309. Like Salza Prina Ricotti, Mari's early treatments of the subject do not consider important discussions by previous scholars, especially alternative interpretations regarding the passage in the obelisk that possibly refers to gardens. 92 Mari 2005a, 125-132; cf. Mari 2005b and 2006, 38. 93 Mari and Sgalambro 2007. For Sgalambro 's important earlier work on the site's remains, which largely avoided the issue of its identification, see n. 82. 94 The most important of these is an oft-reproduced colossal statue of Osirantinous that was excavated in the area of the Cento Camerelle in 1740 (Vatican, Museo Gregoriano Egizio, inv. no. 22795 [= Opper 2008, 233, no. 130 = Meyer 1991, 121-123, no. 4.3 + pl. 107-108, 1]). Though it was assigned to the "Antinoeion" complex by Salza Prina Ricotti and Mari in their first discussions of the site (Salza Prina Ricotti 2002-2003, 123, 139; Mari 2002-2003, 169, 180), it must be recognized that the statue's findspot was far enough away to render this conclusion uncertain (see, e.g. , Grenier 2008, 61, identifying the so-called Canopus Serapeum as its original location). Nonetheless, both scholars have cited this as well as two other statues of Antinous fashioned as telamons as evidence for identifying the site with Antinous, even though the telamons are of unknown provenience (Salza Prina Ricotti 2003-2004, 253 and Mari 2003-2004, 300-301, 308 [cf. Mari 2006, 39-40], citing Museo Pio-Clementino, inv. nos. 196-197 [= Spinola, Museo Pio-Clementino II, 272, nos. 6, 8 + fig. 45]). Mari and Sgalambro even state that the proposed location of these two statues on the porch leading to the templelike structure at the back of the exedra is "secure," despite the lack of any clear evidence to support this (Mari and Sgalambro 2007, 98, with discussion at p. 87). (Mari has also drawn a rather circumstantial connection between the fact that both the telamons and the obelisk were carved from pink Aswan granite and that they turned up around the same time during the Renaissance [Mari 2003-2004, 308; 2005, 130-131].) 95 See Opper 2008, 181, 242 n. 25. The identification of a "chapel-like shrine," as Opper describes it, for Antinous is based on rather insufficient evidence: the Renaissance antiquarian Pirro Ligorio's brief description of "una belís- sima imagine di Bacco- Apollo con la effigie di Antinoo" that was found broken among the rubble in the so-called Latin Library and is thought to have once stood in a windowed apse there (see Raeder 1983, 125 [= cat. no. 2.1], 247-248 and Winnefeld 1895, 102 n. 11, 151).</page><page sequence="26">184 GIL H. RENBERG the obelisk, even though such scenes of enthroned divinities and worshipers facing each other across an offering table are much too common in Egyptian religious art for these similarities to be considered meaningful, and it is not even possible to determine the identity of either the divinity or the petitioner originally represented.96 Along a similar line, Mari seeks support in the suggestion of Serena Ensoli Vittozzi that a gray crater found at the Canopus and featuring on each side two religious scenes that are separated by an obelisk was itself inspired by the scenes on the Pincian obelisk - a possibility that Ensoli herself recognizes as speculative.97 Though this uncertain connection between crater and obelisk is plausible, even if correct it does not necessarily argue for the obelisk having first stood at the newly found complex, since the imagery on the obelisk could easily have been conveyed from Antinoopolis in some manner and influenced an artisan back in Italy.98 Such arguments based on iconographical parallels between carved objects found at Hadrian's Villa and the obelisk are fundamentally flawed for a much more basic reason, however: the square platform upon which Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti have posited the obelisk could have supported several other types of objects (e.g., an altar or shrine, or other non-architectural elements), or perhaps even another obelisk, and thus the Pincian obelisk should not be assumed to have been present and furnishing decorative themes.99 Since published pho- tographs of the platform do not appear to reveal any trace of footing, and none is mentioned by those who have discussed it in print, there is no recorded evidence that an obelisk was affixed to it. Overall, the physical evidence from the complex and its vicinity is insufficient to conclude that it was devoted to honoring Antinous, let alone that his obelisk stood there or his remains were interred there.100 96 See Mari and Sgalambro 2007, 91: "Some blocks assigned to the celias have on one side a rather common but unmistak- able scene in bas-relief that may have been repeated in both temples: a figure who ought to be Antinous stands in front of a seated divinity whose companion stands behind him. The scene is analogous to that which appears on the four sides at the top of the Pincian obelisk: the youth appears as a new god (Antinous-Osiris) in front of four other Egyptian gods (Ra, Thoth, Horus, and a missing figure) in order to offer and receive divine honors" (emphasis added). Cf. Mari 2003-2004, 308; 2005a, 125, 132. Mari 's interpretation is purely speculative. (In addition, Mari incorrectly identifies two of the figures on the obelisk, though this is an unrelated problem. On these figures, see the next note.) 97 Crater: Musei Capitolini, Palazzo dei Conservatori, Sala Egizia, inv. no. 29 (= Ensoli, Musei Capitolini , 47-50, no. 9 + figs. 27-30 = Hadrien Trésors , 238-239, no. 79 [S.

In each of the crater's four scenes there is a mortal with his back to the obelisk facing a god standing or seated beneath a tree, with Side A representing the presentation of sacred symbols and Side В showing gestures of offering. According to Ensoli 's interpretation, the mortal figures on both sides, one of whom wears the royal Double Crown, are to be identified as Hadrian and Antinous, while the four gods are Thoth (in ibis form), Horus (in falcon form, appearing twice), and an unidentified anthropomorphic god thought to be Amon or Osiris. Since the Monte Pincio obelisk on its four pyramidia represents Hadrian offering what was probably a statuette of Maat to Rê-Hor-akhty on one side, and Osirantinous on the three others making offerings, respectively, to Amon, Thoth, and an unidentified divinity who is only partly preserved, Ensoli has seen these as the probable inspiration for the artisan who created the crater, and this led to her identification of the two mortals as Hadrian and Antinous. Ensoli rightly admits, however, that this is not a certainty and suggests that a similar obelisk likewise could have served as the inspiration (Ensoli 2002, 49). But of course, if the crater was specifically carved for Hadrian's benefit, then its scenes could have been devised without any obelisk serving as inspiration, as these were not scenes unique to obelisks. Overall, the thematic similarities simply are not sufficient for a certain conclusion. Moreover, Ensoli's identification of the conical object at the top of the obelisks as a Roman funerary symbol, and thus an allusion to the funerary nature of Antinous's obelisk, is tenuous (Ensoli 2002, 49), though an explanation of its meaning is not readily apparent. (On these obelisk scenes and the identity of the fig- ures represented, see Grenier 2008, 6, 13, 19, 27, who follows Erman's standard edition [Erman 1917, 10-17, 28-47]. The missing figure on one side has been identified by Mambella as Ptah-Tatenen [see Mambella 2008, 76].) 98 See below. The crater, as Ensoli argues on stylistic grounds, is unlikely to have originated in Egypt (Ensoli, Musei Capi- tolini , 47 with п. 91). 99 That the platform potentially had other uses was righdy noted by Grenier 2008, 41. A good photograph is available in Mari and Sgalambr 2007, 90, fig. 10. 100 For a related point, see Grenier 2008, 40-41, question- ing whether the archaeological remains represent sufficient evidence of the complex's proposed funerary nature.</page><page sequence="27">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 185 No less problematic is that Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti (and to a lesser extent Grenier) do not address some of the evidence and arguments most strongly supporting an Egyptian location for the tomb, and these must be considered and satisfactorily addressed by anyone arguing in favor of an Italian location. Most notably, the statement by Epiphanius that Hadrian had Antinous entombed within some sort of luxury vessel (or model of one) at Antinoopolis (wç ó Avi ívouç ó èv Avxivóou xex7]8eu[xévoç, xai èv 'ouooqíu&gt; iikoiu&gt; xeífievoç ònò Aôçiavoõ oíkwç xaxexáyr]), cited by Beaujeu and Boatwright, gets no mention from Salza Prina Ricotti and Mari (other than a brief and dismissive comment in the latter 's 2006 article), while Grenier dismisses it rather unconvincingly.101 To this can be added a previously overlooked Christian source, the complementary statement by Clement of Alexandria from just half a century after the reign of Hadrian that in Egypt this emperor had made Antinous a god, and "Now there is a tomb of this love object, there is a temple of Antinous and a city" (fjôr] ôè xácpoç èaxi xoõ èçwfxévou, vea&gt;ç èaxiv Avtivóou xai 7róXiç).102 Moreover, the next sentence, though a generalized statement about the link between tombs and temples that references different types of funerary structures in Egypt, appears to imply that Antinous was entombed at his temple: "In the same way, it seems to me, that the temples are marveled at, so, too, are the tombs: pyramids, mausoleums, labyrinths and other temples of the dead, these are as tombs of the gods" (xaôárceQ 8é, oipuxi, oí vaoí, oík(o ôrj xaì oí xácpoi OaufxáÇovxar 7iuQafiÊ8eç xai [xauaw^sta xai XaßuQivOoi ôcM.01 vaoì xwv vexQwv, &lt;I)ç èxeîvoi xácpoi xwv 0swv). Taken together, these two sources represent strong evidence of a burial at Antinoopolis, especially since Clement would have been in a position to know if there was only an honorary monument there rather than a tomb.103 In discussing the text of the obelisk itself, Mari seems deliberately selective in his treatment, quoting a passage that he believes supports his case but overlooking one that undermines it. The passage from the obelisk that he does cite is the statement that the gods tomb is located in an imperial property, which, along with Salza Prina Ricotti, he takes to be the gardens at Tivoli.104 However, the passage quoted above stating that An- 101 Epiphanius, Ancoratus 106.9, p. 130 ed. Holl (see Beau- jeu 1955, 254 and Boatwright 1987, 241; cf. Ensoli, Musei Capitolini , 58 п. 103). In their joindy published articles on Antinous 's tomb, Grenier followed a suggestion first made by Erman in arguing that Epiphanius had misinterpreted the sources and was referring to a sacred bark used for transport- ing divine statues during ceremonies (Grenier in Coarelli and Grenier 1986, 221 п. 18; Erman 1917, 11-12), while Coarelli professed himself to be less skeptical (Coarelli in Coarelli and Grenier 1986, 246 п. 86). Grenier, supporting a Roman location for both tomb and obelisk, later speculated that after Hadrian's death the unwelcome corpse was returned to Egypt as a way of explaining Epiphanius's report (Grenier 2008, 39-40). Mari, on the other hand, simply refers to Epiphanius's evidence as "assai dubbia" (Mari 2006, 40). 102 Clem. Alex. Protr. 49.1-3 (quoting 49.3), found in a larger discussion of religion in Egypt. While Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti never address this passage, which has not previously been cited in support of an Egyptian burial, Grenier cites the Protrepticus in a discussion attempting to place the di- vinization of Antinous in the context of the pagan-Christian conflict, as well as that of the tension between Alexandria's Jewish community and non-Jewish majority, but makes no note of Clement's reference to the tomb (Grenier 2008, 71). 103 The possibility of a monument at Antinoopolis lacking the divinized Antinous 's body, unlikely to begin with, is un- dermined by the lack of any reference to this by the various Christian authors who made reference to Antinous in their religious polemics. In particular, it seems inconceivable that Origen would not have mentioned the absence of Antinous 's body in his attack against the Antinoopolis cult (see n. 71), though this is admittedly an argumentum ex silentio. In the passage of Hegesippus referring to prophetes that Jerome directly quotes there may be further proof that Anti- nous was buried at his temple in Antinoopolis: Tumulos mor- tuis templaque fecerunt, sicut usque hodie videmus: e quibus est et Antinous servus Hadriani Caesaris, cui et gymnicus agon exercetur apud Antinoum (sic) civitatem, quam ex eius nomine condidit, et statuii prophetas in templo ("They have made tombs and sacred precincts for the dead, as we can see even today. And from among them there is Antinous the slave of Hadrian Caesar, for whom in addition an athletic competi- tion is held at the city of Antinoë, which he established in that one's name, and where he established prophets in the temple") (Jer. De vir. inlustr. 22). Despite the ambiguity and lack of context, which leave open the possibility that the tomb was elsewhere, this statement appears to provide a parallel for that of Clement. 104 Grimm, Obelisk §IVa (= §Ia, Grenier). See Mari and Sgalambro 2007, 99 and Salza Prina Ricotti 2003-2004, 253-261. On this passage, see below.</page><page sequence="28">186 GIL H. RENBERG tinous "goes out from his tomb (lit. 'holy place') to the numerous temples of the entire land" clearly points to a tomb in Egypt since the Hieroglyphic expression that literally translates as "the land (to) its limit" (n tj dr=f) can refer only to Egypt - and, if somehow the phrase were extended to Italy in this case, the passage would then be claiming, rather preposterously, that Antinous was visiting worshipers in temples all over the peninsula.105 The significance of this passage, however, has not been recognized by any of those arguing for an Italian site. Further undermining the identification of Tivoli (or Rome) as the site of Antinous 's tomb is the argument of Peter Kuhlmann, unknown to Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti as well as Grenier, that since Antinous was the " Gründungsheros " of Antinoopolis, he must have been buried there, according to Greek tradition.106 But most egregiously of all, Kesslers theological and epigraphical arguments assigning the obelisk to the Antinoopolis temple, based on a close study of its text and published as a supplement to Alfred Grimm s text and commentary, are ignored altogether by Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti,107 as are Lawrence Richardson, jr. s brief comments on the matter.108 Thus, while demonstrating full awareness of the earlier scholar- ship assigning Antinous 's tomb to Hadrian's Villa or Rome, Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti minimize or altogether ignore important scholarship that argues otherwise, while Grenier also overlooks certain clues. The result of this selective treatment is to make the archaeologists' identification of the new complex as the "Antinoeion" appear much more certain than it is, just as Grenier's conclusions regarding a site in Rome are more questionable than his work indicates. The Pincian obelisk, generally thought to hold the key to the mystery of where Antinous was entombed, is a much more complicated, contradictory, and ultimately unreliable source on this matter than is often recognized and features multiple textual issues that can alternately favor Egypt or Italy, or else have no probative value.109 This is partly due to the late and noncanonical Hiero- glyphics employed by the author or authors, the nature of which has led to the conclusion that the original draft was written in Greek or Latin - quite possibly with Hadrian himself playing an active part - and then translated imperfecdy into Egyptian, and also to the related belief that it might have been inscribed in Rome.110 The most crucial and controversial of the passages pertaining to this issue is the one interpreted as placing Antinous 's tomb within gardens that were somehow linked to the emperor, which has been at the heart of Grenier's argument in favor of the Horti Sallustiani (or Horti Domitiae) and some of the earlier claims regarding the Canopus and points in and around Rome, and is very important to Salza Prina Ricotti's and Mari's conclusions regarding the (undoubtedly verdant) Tivoli complex.111 This passage, unfortunately, is too vague to permit certain interpretation, and the problem is compounded by damage to the obelisk that has prompted a fruidess and distracting 105 Grimm, Obelisk §IIIc (quoted p. 176 above). For the significance of the Egyptian concept of akh in this context, which further supports the conclusion that Antinous's tomb was in Egypt, see n. 131. 106 Kuhlmann 2002, 198; the argument echoes Kessler 1994, 147. 107 Mari in one of his earlier excavation reports does provide an obligatory footnote to Kessler but gives no sign of hav- ing engaged with this important work to any degree (Mari 2003-2004, 306 n. 64), and in his 2007 study coauthored with Sgalambro he fails to mention it. 108 NTDAR, "Obeliscus Antinoi," p. 272. 109 1 am grateful to Franziska Naether and Heinz-Josef This- sen for their detailed explanations of the linguistic issues addressed in this paragraph. 110 See most recently Baines and Whitehouse 2005, 41 1-412 and Grenier 2008, 42.

Greek is considered more likely to have been the original language than Latin, which would only have been used if the text was first to be inscribed in Rome. 111 Grimm, Obelisk §IVa (= §Ia, Grenier).

That the passage refers to Antinous 's tomb is likely but not completely certain since the clause nty htp m ijt tn ("who rests in this holy place") employs a term (ijt) that has several meanings, for which "tomb" is indeed the best read- ing because in another passage on the obelisk the same term is used less ambiguously.112 The more significant interpretive problem is to be found in the clause that follows, which indicates that the tomb "is located within the gardens of the domain (?) of the princeps [in? of?] Rome" (n(ty)tm-hnw sht tšnnb wp [m? n?] Hjrm').113 The only elements of this phrase that are certain in meaning are the references to the emperor and Rome.114 The relationship between " princeps " and "Rome" is impos- sible to determine because any preposition that would have indicated it was obliterated either in antiquity or modern times when the top of one of the obelisks blocks was cut so as to join the next block more smoothly.115 Originally there was no restoration proposed - indeed, the possibility of a lacuna was not entertained at first - but in recent decades two possibilities have been suggested: the prepositions m ("in") and n ("of"), giving a meaning of either "the emperor in Rome" or "the emperor of Rome."116 This choice of restorations has been thought to be of great significance, since it has been believed to indicate the location of the place in which the tomb was located - a place denoted by the imprecise term sht ts, which Grenier translated "des Jardins du domaine" and Grimm "Inneren des Grenzfeldes," and which literally means "inner part of the boundaries, i.e. sacred circle" or "field/area of frontier/borderline."117 According to one argument, if the correct restora- tion is m, then the obelisk would be referring to such an area "of the emperor in Rome," which has been taken by Grenier as a reference to a location within the city of Rome (e.g., the Adonaea) or else outside of the pomerium (e.g., Horti Sallustiani).118 If, however, n is correct, the passage would 112 Grimm, following Erman's standard edition (Erman 1917, 17, 44), read the term as "Stätte" (Grimm, Obelisk , p. 61 with n. 173), while Derchain read "tombeau" and "tombe" (Derchain 1975, 813; 1991, 1 16), and Grenier originally read "tombeau" (Coarelli and Grenier 1986, 218), subsequendy translating the term as "lieu consacré" while recognizing it as a tomb in his commentary (Grenier 2008, 8). The same term appears in the passage referring to Antinous leaving his tomb and visiting "the numerous temples of the entire land" to aid people (Grimm, Obelisk §IIIc; quoted p. 176 above) but also was used in reference to athletes competing at a stadium "in that place that is consecrated to him which is [in] Egypt and which is named for him (i.e., Antinoopolis)" ( m-hnw ijt=f nty(t) [m] Bjqft] ntyt íw rn=s r rn=f) (Grimm, Obelisk §IIIa; translation adapted from Grenier). Grenier has noted that in the former there is no topographical information regarding the location of the ty - i.e., no mention of a place linked to the emperor or reference to its being in Egypt - and from this he has inferred that the tomb was not in Egypt (Grenier 2008, 25 n. a, on §IIIc; cf. Geenier 2008, 20-21), even though the mention or lack of mention of Egypt in this context has no demonstrable significance (see n. 123) and might be attributed to the unorthodox style in which this text was written. Thus the omission is not necessarily an argument for a location in Rome. 113 Grenier's transliteration, modified to include n as a pos- sible restoration for the lacuna (see below). 114 For the translation of nb wp as "princeps" see Grimm, Obelisk , p. 61 with n. 175 and Grenier 2008, 8 n. c. 115 This damage can be seen both in Grimm's facsimile and transcription and in a photo that he provides (Grimm, Obelisk , pp. 60-61, with pl. 20). According to Grenier, the obelisk sustained damage in this area in antiquity but also was cut when it was re-erected in its current location under Pope Pius VII in 1822 (Grenier in Coarelli and Grenier 1986, 222). Presumably, damage may also have occurred during the many centuries that the toppled blocks lay forgotten in the ground. 116 Grenier was the first to attempt a restoration, arguing for m (Grenier in Coarelli and Grenier 1986, 225). In his edition of the obelisk text eight years later, however, Grimm instead restored n (Grimm, Obelisk , p. 61 with n. 176), which was accepted by Kessler in the same volume (Kessler 1994, 102, 104). Since then, Grenier's restoration of m has been accepted by Derchain and Lembke (Derchain 1991, 110; Lembke 1995, 110) and retained by Grenier himself in his 2008 edition. 117 See Grimm, Obelisk , p. 61 with n. 174. For a full survey of the attempts to interpret this term and translate the phrase, see Grenier 2008, 37-38. For the interpretation of sht as "garden," see Grenier 2008, 42-43 , giving parallels for its use in reference to places with fruit trees or other planted trees and suggesting that it connoted public gardens. 1 18 As noted above, Grenier and Coarelli joindy proposed the Adonaea, "Gardens of Adonis," thought to have been located on the Palatine, which was where the imperial palace stood and thus the emperor's "domain" (Coarelli and Grenier 1986, esp. 228-229, 240-246). However, as Grenier rightly noted</page><page sequence="30">188 GIL H. RENBERG become far less precise regarding the location of Antinous 's tomb, only identifying it as within an area "of the emperor of Rome." Such a phrase might be taken as a reference to Egypt in general or Antinoopolis specifically (i.e., a frontier territory and a city belonging to the emperor, respectively), while Hadrian's Villa (i.e., an imperial estate in Rome's countryside "frontier") would perhaps be the most logical option outside of Egypt. However, regardless of whether either restoration attempt has been correct, this must be recognized as a non-issue: first, the prepositional phrase "[in? of?] Rome" refers to the princeps ( nb wjs) and has no bearing on the tomb's location, especially since there is litde difference in this context between "emperor in Rome" and "emperor of Rome"; and second, due to the late and unconventional nature of the Hieroglyphics, it is possible that the author did not even distinguish between n and m, if one of those was indeed used.119 Therefore, it is best to leave this lacuna unrestored (nb wjs [-] Hjrm'), as was previously done by Erman in his 1917 standard edition, and instead to treat the final phrase as a reference to the emperor of Rome from which some minor piece of information is missing - if not n or m, then a tide or some other sort of description.120 Grenier has effectively argued against previous conclusions that the site referred to in this pas- sage was Hadrian's Villa121 but, as noted above, does not sufficiently disprove the possibility of a burial in the land of Antinous 's death, ignoring both Boatwright's arguments in favor of the obelisk passage referring to the temple of Antinous and those against assigning the tomb to Rome.122 In his point-by-point refutation of previous suggestions regarding the tomb's location, Grenier argues that in later retracting his support for the Adonaea, the identifica- tion of this complex with the site of the Vigna Barberini is by no means certain, which undermines the suggestion that Antinous was buried there (Grenier 2008, 43); this alone, however, is not a reason to rule out the Palatine area. (For the multiple difficulties in identifying and determining the nature of the Adonaea - a name that is itself uncertain since it is partly based on a restoration - see NTDAR , "Adonaea," p. 1 and M. Royo, LTUR , "Adonaea," 1:14-16.) 119 The text of the Monte Pincio obelisk is not alone in this: Hieroglyphics from the Greco-Roman period often featured a muddled approach, termed "Égyptien de tradition," rather than being written in authentic Middle Egyptian, which by then was an archaic language. Thus the Monte Pincio text, employing the unusual language often seen in ornate texts that were written more for decorum than function, is not always clear in its intended meaning. In this case, not only does the lack of any traces of either m or n due to the damage make restoration inadvisable and poindess, but also the lack of certainty regarding whether one would have been distinct from the other in the author's mind. 120 In his discussion of the damage to the obelisk that created this lacuna in the text, Grenier concludes that the missing sign or signs must have been relatively flat, which limits the possibilities (illustrated by Grenier in Grenier and Coarelli 1986, 223, fig. 4). 121 As Grenier shows, since Erman did not note the presence of the lacuna, his reading and interpretation of the phrase as a reference to Rome's ager suburbanus - which in turn was cited by later scholars as evidence that the tomb was located at Hadrian's Villa - should no longer be accepted (Erman 1917; Grenier 2008, 37-38, 40-41). Grenier also disputes the interpretation of Derchain, who accepted Grenier's restora- tion of the lacuna but translated the phrase as "le domaine campagnard de celui qui détient le pouvoir à Rome" (i.e., Hadrian's Villa), demonstrating why such a translation is difficult to accept (Grenier 2008, 41-42, on Derchain 1991, 116). To Grenier's arguments can be added the point that the phrase sht tš, implying a consecrated zone, would not have been used for a private house or royal dwelling. (I am grateful to Franziska Naether for this last point.) 122 Boatwright, in consultation with Egyptologist Orval Wintermute and using Erman's text, translated the passage as referring to a "temenos of the land(s) of the master(?) ... of Rome," noting that all of the land on which both the temple and the city itself were built had belonged to Hadrian (Boatwright 1987, 258). Though footnoting her work in his discussion of this passage (Grenier 2008, 38 n. 5), Grenier does not address this point, nor does he take issue with two other points: that a Roman site for the tomb and obelisk is unlikely both because "the lack of standardization in the cult of Antinoos in the west makes it difficult to accept that the obelisk of Antinoos and the tomb or cenotaph mentioned in its inscription was put up by the emperor in the capital city" (Grenier 2008, 257-258), and in Rome itself Hadrian's religious policies and activities were very traditional and the obelisk "is too out of harmony" with this (Grenier 2008, 260). (To these arguments against Rome can be added another, that Hadrianic coins minted at Rome betray no sign of Antinous's funerary monument or obelisk, either of which would be expected if he had been entombed at Rome with an obelisk advertising his divinity erected at the site.)</page><page sequence="31">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 189 the phrase sht tš is too vague and allusive for Egypt or Antinoopolis but also makes a contradictory argument (and one partly depending on parallels in the obelisk text that prove largely irrelevant): on the one hand, he states that since elsewhere in the text specific references are made to Egypt and Antinoopolis, one would expect the same here if the tomb were indeed in Antinoopolis, but on the other hand he states that since the section discussing the Antinoeia specifies that these games were held in Antinoopolis, it should be inferred that the obelisk itself was not there.123 Such logic could just as easily be used to undermine Greniers own suggestion that the tomb and obelisk were at the Horti Sallustiani or else near Hadrian's mausoleum since arguably there would be no need to state that the tomb was "à l'intérieur des Jardins du domaine du Prince dans Rome" if it and the obelisk were both in Rome. As Grenier himself later notes, this text is likely to have been translated from a Greek or Latin original,124 and this created difficulties in the text that would not be there if it had been drafted in Egyptian - difficulties that are compounded by the translator's desire to create a highly decorous text. Moreover, it is possible that some problems in the inscription can be explained by the need to finish it quickly, if the obelisk was erected around the time of the first Antinoeia in A.D. 13 1. 125 Therefore, even if one puts aside the issue of how to handle the apparent lacuna, it is ill advised to base an argument primarily on this passage: ultimately, the statement that the tomb "is located within the gardens of the domain (?) of the princeps [in? of?] Rome" proves to be tantaliz- ing but inconclusive evidence regarding this matter and should be given much less weight, if any. Despite the discovery of the so-called Antinoeion complex at Hadrian's Villa and the arguments favoring specific sites in Rome, the full text of the obelisk along with two patristic sources and some circumstantial evidence all point to Antinous 's tomb having been located in the Egyptian city established in his honor, and thus it is time to dispense with the conclusion that Antinous 's body ever left Egypt. A more legitimate problem, however, is why an obelisk bearing a text so closely as- sociated with the worship of Antinous at that city would have been found in Rome instead during the Renaissance. Those who have most recendy argued for Antinoopolis as the tomb's location have concluded that the obelisk would have stood there too and suggested that it was later transported to Rome by Elagabalus so as to embellish either the new Circus Varianus or the Temple of Elagabalus that is thought to have been in the Vigna Barberini.126 There is, however, an alternative explanation, 123 Grenier 2008, 38-39. In arguing the first point, Grenier states that there are several places in the text where Egypt is specifically named, implying that because this happens in five different passages, the absence of a reference to Egypt in the passage about the tomb is significant (Grenier 2008, 38 n. 8). However, most of the examples Grenier cites do not support his argument: two are irrelevant because they are used in praise of Hadrian (as master of Egypt), the empress Sabina, or the god Hapy (who inundates the land of Egypt) (Grimm, Obelisk §Ic [= Grenier SIVb-c]), another passage concerns people moving to Antinoopolis from all over Egypt (Grimm, Obelisk §IVb [= §Ic, Grenier]; see n. 63), and an- other states that Antinous "is known for having become a god in the 'abatons' of Egypt and shrines have been built for him where he is worshiped as a god by the prophets and priests of Upper and Lower Egypt and likewise by the inhabitants of Egypt" (rh.tw=fr ntr m tywt ntr.ywt n.(w)t Km.t hws.tw n=frj-pr.w dw^.tw=fmi ntr in hm-ntr.w w'b.w nw Tj.wy imy.w Tymryt mi(tt) iry.w) (Grimm, Obelisk §IVa [= §Ib, Grenier], transliteration sHghdy modified; translation adapted from Grenier). With these dissimilar and overly general references to Egypt elimi- nated, the only mention of Egypt in a topographical context , remains the one concerning the Antinoeia games being held "in that place that is consecrated to him which is [in] Egypt and which is named for him (i.e., Antinoopolis)" (Grimm, Obelisk §IIIa; see n. 112). And since it was not uncommon for Egyptian texts to refer to places as "in Egypt," this one passage is not proof of the obelisk's origin outside of Egypt. Grenier's point, therefore, is far from conclusive. 124 Seen. 110. 125 The point is that of Boatwright 1987, 258 n. 66. 126 Circus Varianus: see Boatwright 1987, 258-259; cf. NTDAR , "Obeliscus Antinoi," p. 272 and Hannestad 1982, 69 (the latter associating the obelisk with the spina but arguing that it was brought from Hadrian's Villa). (For an alternate theory associating the obelisk with the circus , see n. 80.) Temple of Elagabalus: Kessler 1994, 149. In her review of the work of Grimm and Kessler, Lembke raises rather insignificant objections to this supposition, including that most obelisks taken from Egypt originated in the Delta area (Lembke 1995, 1 1 1). To date no one has argued convincingly</page><page sequence="32">190 GIL H. RENBERG though one that has received little support, that is at least worth considering: as recendy argued by Ensoli, the Monte Pincio obelisk may be a copy of the original that stood before Antinous s tomb-temple, either prepared in Egypt and transported back to Italy or carved in Italy based on a draft copy from Egypt.127 Since obelisks were produced in Italy as well as Egypt, neither possibility can be ruled out, and the opinions holding that its execution point was one rather than the other are largely subjective.128 If the obelisk was indeed a copy of the one in Antinoopolis, then the chief questions would be whether it originally stood in Rome or at Hadrian's Villa and whether its context would have been an honorary monument or an actual cult site dedicated either to Antinous or the Egyptian gods in general.129 This, like so much associated with the death and subsequent worship of Antinous, is impossible to determine since if the obelisk was a copy never intended to stand before Antinous 's tomb, then it could have been prepared for any of the sites in Rome that have been proposed - not to mention others that have not yet been considered because of the fixation on the "gardens" passage in the obelisk text - or else at Hadrian's Villa, perhaps but not necessarily in the "Antinoeion" complex, as Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti have proposed.130 But the text itself was prepared for a monument that was to be erected in Antinoopolis. Regardless of whether the Monte Pincio obelisk, an unrelated obelisk, or another sort of ob- ject altogether stood atop the square platform at the center of the "Antinoeion, w and regardless of whether this site was indeed devoted to Antinous, it should no longer be considered his final resting place. If the obelisk indeed stood at this complex, then perhaps it featured an honorarius tumulus as Salza Prina Ricotti originally suggested, but it would not have been the tomb referred to in the obelisk text, and the obelisk would be a surviving copy of the obelisk or pair of obelisks that stood in Antinoopolis, produced at the emperor's command in order to grace his villa.131 Since that the obelisk would not have been brought to Rome under Elagabalus (though Beaujeu 1955, 255, uncertain whether the obelisk first stood in Antinoopolis or Hadrian's Villa, suggests that it might have been brought to the Horti Variani by Septimius Severus or Caracalla). 127 See Ensoli, Musei Capitolini , 49-50, 57-58 with n. 102. Ensoli's suggestion is made in the context of arguing that the crater found at the Canopus was inspired by the scenes represented at the top of the obelisk (see n. 97). If correct, this would indicate that the obelisk was already in Italy dur- ing the reign of Hadrian, not brought there by Elagabalus. Even if so, however, this link between crater and obelisk would provide no further evidence for the issues of where Antinous was buried and the nature of the "Antinoeion" complex. Ensoli also comments that if one accepts Greniers restoration of the lacuna in the obelisk text, then the passage would have had to have been partly reworded for the version erected in Rome, but such a conclusion is unnecessary - not only because of the difficulties in interpreting this passage noted above but also because far too few people in Rome or Tivoli would have been able to read the Hieroglyphics to make such an adaptation worthwhile (see Boatwright 1987, 250, noting the insignificant number of those in Rome with the ability or interest to read the obelisk). The idea of the obelisk being a copy was dismissed by Kessler (1994, 148) and appears not to have been addressed elswhere. 128 John Baines and Helen Whitehouse, for example, see stylistic differences between the obelisk's Hieroglyphics and those employed in Egypt at the time, as well as its slighdy rectangular shape, as reasons to conclude that it was manufactured in Rome, albeit with the likely involvement of Egyptian craftsmen (Baines and Whitehouse 2005, 412, followed by Mari and Sgalambro 2007, 99). Such stylistic differences, however, might instead be attributed to the likelihood that the text was translated from Greek or Latin (see n. 1 10). In contrast, one can just as easily argue that the text of the obelisk is unusually complex and well executed for one composed and carved in Italy. (I am grateful to Terry Wilfong for this last point.) 129 For a dedication from Rome's Iseum Campense thought to have been for Antinous, which would show him to have had at least some presence at the site, see n. 73. In addition, the Greek dedicatory inscription that provides the basis for restoring Antinous's name in this one was found along the Via Portuensis, perhaps signaling his worship at Portus (IG 14:960 [=RICIS 503/1203]). 130 Ensoli has suggested that if Coarelli and Grenier were correct about there having been a site devoted to Antinous on the Palatine, then this obelisk would have originated at a temple of Antinous or cenotaph in this part of Rome (Ensoli, Musei Capitolini , p. 50). 131 For honorarius tumulus, see n. 89. In addition to "tomb," the term ty could mean "cenotaph," so its use in the pas- sages discussed above (see n. 112) would not rule out the possibility of the obelisk having referred to and stood</page><page sequence="33">HADRIAN AND THE ORACLES OF ANTINOUS 191 there is no reliable evidence linking the obelisk to this platform or Antinous to this site, however, it requires a leap of faith to identify the complex first unearthed in 1998 as one devoted to Antinous. Arguing in favor of this, as Mari and Salza Prina Ricotti have observed, is its prominent location near the ceremonial entrance, as well as the discovery of Antinous statues in the general vicinity, and its construction in the final years of Hadrian's reign and life.132 It is at least as likely, however, that this complex was merely a highly Egyptianized nymphaeum, similar to the one featuring an obelisk and numerous examples of Egyptian or Egyptianizing art (and perhaps architecture as well) that by the early third century A.D. stood within Romes Horti Sallustiani.133 Such a conclusion is supported both by the complex's similarity to other Egyptian sanctuaries and Egyptianized sites and the discovery of generic pieces of Egyptian art, including an imported statue of Ramesses II, at the "Antinoeion" complex.134 Even if it was a cult site rather than a complex that was primarily decorative in nature, and even if the sculptures of Osirantinous linked to it did indeed originate there, this would not necessarily mean that the complex was primarily devoted to Antinous: after all, the one dedicatory inscription for Antinous from Rome comes from the Iseum Campense, where he was one of several Egyptian gods worshiped alongside Isis and Sarapls. Therefore, although it is possible that this complex memorialized Antinous in some manner, the so-called Tomba di Antinoo or Antinoeion at Hadrian's Villa should no longer be referred to as such, and instead it should be considered the latest addition to the list of complexes and structures initially identified with a famous person on grounds that upon further examination proved insufficient.135 The tomb of Antinous itself, still undiscovered, should be assigned to his eponymous city - which his corpse surely never left - and expunged from our perception of Rome's urban landscape, while the Monte Pincio obelisk should no longer be treated as evidence to the contrary. And the obelisk's origin and odyssey are likely to remain a mystery. in front of a cenotaph. However, since the aspect of the deceased Antinous that would have been traveling around and healing people according to the passage quoted above (see p. 176) would be his akh , or "effective spirit," and this spiritual element tended to be centered at (or haunt) the place where the body lay, "tomb" seems preferable to "cenotaph," and thus the obelisk text does not support the idea of its having been prepared for a cenotaph or honorarius tumulus. (I am grateful to Terry Wilfong for this point regard- ing Antinous's akh.) 132 In addition to being near the ceremonial entrance, the complex was on an axis with the imperial palace and thus ap- pears to have been meant to be viewed by Hadrian from there (see Salza Prina Ricotti 2002-2003, 141). For the dating of the complex after A.D. 130, see Mari and Sgalambro 2007, 97. 133 See Hartswick 2004, 130-138 on the Horti Sallustiani complex, and 52-58 on the Sallustian obelisk. According to Mari and Sgalambro 2007, 83, the "Antinoeion" was initially identified as a nymphaeum, but it was soon associated with Antinous. (I am grateful to Lawrence Richardson, jr., for suggesting this complex as a parallel.) 134 See Mari 2005a, 132-140 on these Egyptian works, as well as the complex's similarity to Rome's Iseum Campense and another Iseum at Industria (on which see Bongioanni and Grazzi 1988 and Zanda 1997). See also Pracchia 2006, contextualizing the Egyptian elements from the site. These similarities are also examined in Mari and Sgalambro 2007, 92-96, though the authors note (at 95 n. 18) that the two flanking temples differentiate the Tivoli complex from the others. However, there are too few Egyptian sanctuaries with an exedra for meaningful comparison. 135 As stated by Grenier, this site is "un édifice que ses inventeurs, cédant à l'enthousiasme, ont aussitôt dénommé Antinoeion et identifié comme étant le temple tombeau du nouveau dieu" (Grenier 2008, 40). One hopes that future ex- cavations at Hadrian's Villa will shed more light on this issue.</page><page sequence="34">192 GIL H.
