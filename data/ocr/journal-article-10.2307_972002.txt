<plain_text><page sequence="1">One of the most enigmatic aspects of decapitation practices among south coastal Peruvian Paracas and Nasca cultures (900 B. C.-A.D. 750) is the near absence of headless bodies in the archaeological record. Drawing on a case study of an Early Nasca, Phase 3 headless burial at Site PV62D13 in the lower Ica Valley, together with examples of headless interments reported in the literature, I examine the nature and disposition of headless burials. Three burial patterns, or forms, are proposed. The burial at PV62D13 is distinguished for its extended posture and interment in a non-cemetery setting and is proposed to be a dedica- tory burial. Burialforms for disembodied heads are also examined, and over time, a notable increase in cached heads, buried without grave offerings is observed. Painted ceramic images of Nasca trophy heads and headless bodies are reviewed diachron- ically and a marked increase in decapitation scenes is notedfor Late Nasca. Attention is drawn to the limited number of head- less body images overall, and possible solutions to reconcile the visual imagery with the archaeological data are offered. Uno de los aspectos mas enigmaticos en las pra'cticas de decapitacion humana entre las culturas Paracas y Nasca (900 a. C.-750 d. C.) de la costa sur Peruana, es la casi ausencia de enterramientos de cuerpos sin cabezas. Mientras las cabezas se las encuen- tran decapitadas o como cabezas "trofeo" y sus equivalentes iconograficos por todas partes, la escasez de cuerpos sin cabezas, y en efecto, la casi ausencia de imagenes visuales respectivas durante Nasca temprano son notables. Aqu f examino la fndole y me'todo de enterrar los cue rpos decapitados haciendo uso de un caso de enterramiento Nasca temprano, Fase 3 de un cue rpo sin cabeza excavado a Sitio PV62D13 en el valle bajo de Ica, junto con ejemplos de otros enterramientos sin cabezas que se encuentran en la literatura. Se proponen tres patrones o formas de enterramientos. El entierro en el Sitio PV62D13, sugiere ser un enterramiento tipo of renda, que se distingue por su postura extendida y su ubicacion que no corresponde a aquellos de un cemeterio. Dos fechas radiocarbonicas ubican el enterramiento en un rango de restos culturales de Nasca 3. Aquf se discuten las discrepancias entre estas dos fechas. Tambie'n, se establecen y comparan las formas de enterramientos de cabezas trofeo a trave's del tiempo, encontra'ndose que existe un incremento notable en entierros de cabezas agrupadas sin ofrendas. Se examinan diacronicamente la ceramica dec- orada con cabezas trofeo y con cuerpos decapitados, notandose un aumento en la presencia de escenas de decapitacion en Nasca tardfo. Llama la atencion el numero restringido de imagenes que muestran cuerpos decapitados y propongo posibles soluciones a fin de conciliar las ima'genes visuales con los datos arqueologicos. Finalmente, se concluye que el analisis de enterramientos sin cabezas es un me'todo va lioso pa ra a c la ra r e l estudio de los sacrificios h umanos y espeefficamente, la p ractica de decap itacion.

The northern Chilean Chinchorro culture (700s1500 B.C.) is credited with incipient artificial mummification in thetrue senseofembalming (Arriaza 1996:131-134; Rivera 1995:61-63). In later times, the Inka (A.D. 1476-1534) are known to have mummified the bod- ies of rulers and to have displayed them as living ancestors during ceremonial events (Rowe 1995:29; Salomon 1995:332). Cultural modification of the human body in the form of cranial deformation, body tattoos, and artificial mummification is strongly sup- ported by the archaeological evidence and visual imagery of Precolumbian Peru. Among these prac- tices, mummification of human heads is most com- mon among south coastal peoples known as Paracas and Nasca (900 B.C.-A.D. 750). In numerous archaeological contexts associated with the Nasca culture (A.D. lOWA.D. 750), caches of bodiless heads attest to the proliferous nature of this phe- nomenon (Baraybar 1987; Browne et al.1993; Neira and Penteado 1972-1973; Penteado 1972; Tello 1918; Verano 1995). While interpretations may dif- fer as to the nature of removal (victim or willing par- ticipant), or the agent of decapitation (ritual specialist or enemy warrior), the preponderance of heads clearly suggests a cultural emphasis on their impor- 363 1 HE BODY CONTEXT: INTERPRETING EARLY NASCA DECAPITATED BURIALS Lisa DeLeonardis</page><page sequence="2">[Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 364 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tance. Verano (1995:219) aptly observes that it is among the Paracas and Nasca cultures that the iconography of disembodied heads is most closely paralleled by the physical evidence. One aspect of this intriguing practice that is crit- ical to a wider view of Nasca mortuary ritual and cus- toms are the headless bodies. While disembodied heads occupy a conspicuous place in the literature, headless bodies have received far less attention. The lack of discussion stems, in part, to a paucity of intact, headless burials in the archaeological record as compared to the number of heads that are found. The few headless bunals, when documented, are often considered anomalous rather than a cultural pattern or sub-pattern worthy of inquiry, yet there appear to be distinct forms among the headless cases. In the present study I re-examine Nasca decapi- tation practices by addressing body treatments accorded to headless bunals. I focus on a time period of Early Nasca history when head removal was com- mon and included a corresponding imagery of dis- embodied heads, but lacked a repertoire of visual imagery for headless bodies. Drawing on a rare case of an intact, Early Nasca headless burial excavated from the lower IcaValley, as well as from other exam- ples of headless bodies in the literature, I propose that meaningful burial patterns existed for the head- less, and that analysis of body treatment promises to lend integral support to our interpretations of dis- embodied heads and their associated imagery. I also raise the question as to whether the paucity of head- less body imagery over time is relative to a wider cultural de-emphasis on the headless body. Ulti- mately the study hopes to contribute to our under- standing of Nasca beliefs concerning the head and the body and their relationship to concepts of life and death. I begin with an overview of Nasca mortuary prac- tices, which include interment of whole and partial bodies. Focusing on examples of headless body inter- ments, I propose that three forms of headless inter- ments are present in the archaeological record, and compare them to burials of disembodied heads. I then tgn to the visual imagery of disembodied heads and headless bodies to examine how the imagery cor- responds to the diachronic trends observed for the physical remains. In compiling data for this study, I encountered the familiar problem of inconsistencies in the variables recorded for skeletal and ceramic data, including provenience. By choosing to address burial remains, I also encountered gaps in the archaeological record that undoubtedly can be attributed to centuries of grave looting in the Nasca region. In addition to my own data, bunal data presented here that were com- piled from other sources were carefully reviewed and sorted. Data with questionable provenience or lacking context were eliminated. Discrepancies in samples sizes for portions of the data are noted in the text. Cultural, Geographic, and Chronological Setting Nascal cultural remains are found on the south coast of Peru in a region consisting of several river valleys extending north and south from the Rfo Grande de NascaDrainage (Figure 1). Geographically, the south coast forms the northernmost reaches of the Ata- cama desert, the world's most arid environment after the Sahara of Africa. Rivers are only seasonally active and the average annual rainfall is less than a few cen- timeters. Modern agriculturalists and viticulturalists operate on an intensive scale for the world market with the use of irrigation-a system initiated by ancient farmers over 2,000 years ago. Nasca is the term applied to both the archaeo- logical culture (A.D. 100 A.D. 750) and the nver drainage, Rio Grande de Nasca (Figures 1 and 2). Nasca peoples are best known for creating geoglyphs or "Nasca lines" that cover 550 square kilometers of the desert pampa (Aveni 1990; Reiche 1974; Rein- del et al. l999; Reinhard 1988; Silverman 1990; Sil- verman and Browne 1991). The most prominent Nasca site, Cahuachi, is located in the Rfo Grande de Nasca Drainage, where a senes of temple mounds and cemeteries have been scientifically excavated (Kroeber and Collier 1998; Orefici 1992; Silverman 1993; Strong 1957). Rather than an urban center with a large, permanent residential population, Cahuachi is thought to have functioned pnmarily as a cere- monial pilgrimage center (Silverman 1990, 1993). Various fertility rituals celebrating calendrical events associated with agriculture such as the summer sol- stice, new moons, and harvest are argued to have drawn thousands from the surrounding settlements (Silverman 1990, 1991, 1993). Clearly, the agricul- tural motifs (plants, seeds, harvesting tools) that dom- inate the iconography of finely painted, polychrome ceramics and textiles for this period,support an emphasis on agricultural fertility and success in farm-</page><page sequence="3"> DeLeonardis] THE BODY CONTEXT: INTERPRETING EARLY NASCA DECAPITATED BURIALS 365 Intermediate Period. The Nasca sequence is subdi- vided into nine phases, Nasca 1-9, but only six, Nasca 2-7, refer to Nasca-style material culture and societal developments.2 Nasca phases 24 concern Early Nasca society and the proposed apogee of Cahuachi (Silverman 1993 :222). Middle phase Nasca 5 corresponds to the demise of Cahuachi, and we associate Late phases Nasca S7 with a geo- graphic expansion on the south coast (Proulx 1994:95). The absolute chronology of Phases 24 of the Nasca stylistic sequence is poorly documented. In terms of material culture, Nasca succeeded Paracas in time. The two are often described as sep- arate entities but in fact a cultural continuum is rec- ognized. Both groups mummified disembodied heads; a greater number of physical remains are attributed to Nasca peoples, although on the south coast, the iconography of disembodied heads was ini- tiated during Late Paracas times. The division between "Late Paracas" and "Early Nasca" is a hazy boundary, defined by a change in pottery technology when the post-fired painted and incised Paracas pot- tery tradition was gradually replaced by a pre-fired, painted tradition (Menzel et al. 1964:2). In terms of design themes, geometric elements were gradually replaced by an emphasis on naturalistic themes such as plants and animals, and mythological creatures, and a greater number of human-like representations are developed (Blagg 1975). Nasca Mortuary lkeatment and Partial Burial Analysis Nasca mortuary treatment has been widely addressed in the literature since the first tomb excavations dur- ing the early decades of the twentieth century (Carmichael 1988, 1995; Isla 1992; Kroeber and Collier 1998; Lothrop and Mahler 1957; Orefici 1992; Proulx 1970; Silverman 1993; Strong 1957; Tello 1918; Uhle 1914). The most comprehensive synthesis of mortuary contexts was undertaken by Carmichael (1988) and formed the basis of his doc- toral dissertation; he has since edited Kroeber's 1926 field report (Kroeber and Collier 1998), bringing forth an indispensable source of notes and illustra- tions. Nasca peoples entombed their dead princi- pally in cemeteries. Most bodies are found in a seated, flexed position, usually enshrouded in one or more textiles and accompanied by burial objects. Entombment in large ceramic urns placed in a pre- pared pit and covered with a roof of logs and thatch Figure 1. South coastal Peru showing geographic range of Nasca sites. ing (Carmichael 1994; Sawyer 1979; Townsend 1985). Schreiber's work in the area has documented expanses of ancient cultivation and a subterranean irrigation system of puquios (Schreiber 1990,1991, 1998; Schreiber and Isla 1997; Schreiber and Lan- cho 1995). While archaeological investigations concerning the Nasca culture have been carried out primarily in the Rio Grande de Nasca Drainage, Nasca sites have been identified also throughout the IcaValley (Cook 1994; Massey 1986; Pezzia 1968; Rowe 1956; Strong 1957; Uhle 1914; Williams and Pazos 1974) (Figures 1 and 3). Many of these important sites have yet to be fully investigated but future work promises to contribute to a clearer understanding of the pres- ence of Nascain the IcaValley. Cook's (1999:71-72) recent analysis of settlement patterns for the middle and lower IcaValley recognizes a Late Paracas/Early Nasca continuum at sites ranging from Ocucaje south to the mouth of the river. During the course of sur- face survey and excavations, I observed Early Nasca cultural remains throughout Callango, a region of the lower Ica Valley south of Ocucaje (DeLeonardis 1991, 1997). An Early Nasca burial encountered in excavations is discussed below. Within the chronological framework established for the central Andes, Nasca occupied primarily the first half of the first millennium A.D., or the Early</page><page sequence="4"> Figure 2.

Extended and side- flexed postures are less common (Carmichael 1988:18(}181), as are multiple interments (group burials), with both occurring in later Nasca times. Secondary interments, bodiless graves, and empty tombs are also known (Carmichael 1988). Animal burials (parrot, mouse, llama) have been reported, but are considered to be rare (Carmichael 1988:36(}361; Lothrop and Mahler 1957:4; Silverman 1993:199). Although modest in comparison to their south coast Paracas predecessors, every Nasca individual received meaningful interment. Even during Mid- dle and Late Nasca times when status differentia- tion is evident in burial practices, every person was enshrouded in cloth, and with an offering, whether it be one or two ceramic vessels, a swatch of hair, or other keepsake. A small proportion of individu- als thought to be prisoners, criminals, suicides, or other social outcasts also received their due: they were cast into pits without offerings. Silverman (1993:215), following Bloch and Parry (1982: 15-18), refers to this type of interment as a "bad death." Partial Burials Partial-body burials constitute an integral part of Nasca mortuary treatments. They have been recorded from various Nasca cemeteries as otherwise articu- lated skeletons missing a limb or other body part, as whole or partial skeletons that have been disarticu- lated or rearticulated (often bundles of bones from a single person), or as an intact portion of the body buried singularly orin acache (see Carmichael 1988; Kroeber and Collier 1998). A few partial burials are the result of looting or tomb re-entry, but clear cases of intact, undisturbed interments are more numerous (Tables 1-3). Two forms of partial-body burials of particular interest to this study are disembodied heads and headless bodies. Disembodied Heads. Disembodied heads, more commonly known as "trophy heads," are carefully mummified heads that are proposed to have been sev- ered, at or around the time of death, from the body (Figure 4). These heads are not the random result of looter's pillage, but rather the intentional work of skilled persons to create a life-like rendition. Dis- embodied heads are devoid of internal tissue and</page><page sequence="5">DeLeonardis] THE BODY CONTEXT: INTERPRETING EARLY NASCA DECAPITATED BURIALS 367 Figure 3.

Heads have been recovered from cemeteries, house floors, and shallow pits, as individual finds, and in caches. Some heads appear to have received a formal burial in the sense that they were accom- panied by grave goods or other offerings, but most were interred without accouterments. Early Nasca finds were recovered principally from cemetery set- tings(Browneetal.1993:287;Carmichaell988:482; Kowta 1987:66; Kroeber and Collier 1998:50, 73- 73, 79; Pezzia 1968). By Nasca 5, caches of heads are recorded with greater frequency (Browne et al. 1993:274-294; NeiraandPenteado 1972-1973; Pen- teado 1972; Rubini 1957:34; Silverman 1993:214, 225, n3; Verano 1995:212-213). muscle but generally possess skin and at least a shock of hair. Often the eye sockets and cheekbones are stuffed with cloth; eyelids are sewn shut and the jaw is secured to keep the mouth closed. During Nasca times, cactus spines were pierced through the skin surrounding the mouth to cover the dentition. Due to poor preservation of the skin and hair of some examples, there are heads that lack the taxidermic detail and appear as bare skulls, but all heads pos- sess a hole in the forehead through which a rope was strung. On the south coast, the heads appear with fre- quency during Late Paracas times and seem to increase after Nasca 3 upon the abandonment of Cahuachi during a time of major societal upheaval (Silverman 1993:222). Carmichael (1994:84) esti- mates that during Nasca times between five and ten percent of the population was decapitated. Lamen-</page><page sequence="6">368 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 itation were interred, and there appears to be differ- ential forms of burial among the headless cases. In this study, headless burials are defined as artic- ulated burials that lack only the head and upper cer- vical vertebrae, resulting from decapitation. These are morphologically distinct from secondary burials (individuals who were re-buried), disarticulated par- tial burials (often bundles of bones), and disturbed burials (looted). Omitted from the analysis are cases where it is clear that the head was torn off after the body was mummified (e.g., Kroeber and Collier 1998:78, Grave Al-4). The Headless Burial at PV62D13: A Case Study Excavations at PV62D13 During excavations conducted by the author in 1995 at a small Early Paracas residential site in the lower IcaValley, known as PV62D13, the burial of a young, headless male was encountered (Figure 3). Situated to the east of the principal architecture in an unmarked grave, the articulated human skeleton lay extended and prone, partially wrapped in a textile (Figure 5). Missing from the skeleton were the skull, and three upper cervical vertebrae (C1&lt;3). The body was oriented in a northwest-southeast direction with the upper torso positioned to the southeast, and it rested on a prepared sand floor (Figure 6). The bur- ial was surrounded by offerings including a ceramic Figure 4. This Nasca disembodied head was excavated by Julio C. Tello at the site of La Salinas, Coyungo, Rio Grande de Nasca Drainage (Tello 1918:Lamina III). Headless Bodies. Intact headless bodies occupy a small proportion of partial-body burials in com- parison to their whole-body and disembodied head counterparts.

A lime- stone rock was positioned in the place of the head. The burial is recognized as a Nasca intrusion after the Paracas residence was abandoned during Ocu- caje Phase 8 (DeLeonardis 1997:222). Skeletal analysis. The well-preserved skeleton retained some mummified tissue, and was complete, except for the skull, the three upper cervical verte- brae (the atlas, axis, and C-3, or C1 - C3), and ster- num.3 None of the bones exhibited signs of illness or malnutrition. The absence of the skull, supported by the loss of the three upper cervical vertebrae, is consistent with decapitation. There were no indica- tions that the burial was disturbed or that the skull had been removed postmortem. The lower cervical vertebra (C&gt;C7) were examined for cut marks or fractures, but none were observed. Age and sex determination were assessed accord- ing to criteria outlined in Bass (1987), such as epi- physeal closure, and length of the long bones without epiphyses. Sex estimation of a sub-adult is difficult owing to the fact that the innominate (and others), which are normally analyzed to make sex estimates, are similar for both sub-adult males and females (Bass 1987:19). However, I judged the sex and age to be a young male between 11-13 years of age. Grave o;fJ7erings. Surrounding the body were eight gourd containers, one ceramic bowl, and three wooden objects (Figure 6). The gourds (Figure 7) and ceramic bowl (Figure 8) were filled with soil and organic matter. Although botanical analysis of the contents is pending, it is likely that the containers were filled with provisions for the afterlife. One gourd contained a miniature spindle, while another, the small vertebrae of a quadrupedal animal. Minia- ture objects such as the spindle and vertebrae have been found in other Nasca contexts associated with young persons and are variously associated with age and social status (Carmichael 1988:313-314; Sil- verman 1993:217). The polychrome ceramic bowl was decorated with a repetitive design element on the vessel exte- rior (Figure 9). The repeated design has been vari- ously described as abstractions of fruit, hands, or feet (Proulx 1968), and cat or bird pelage (Carmichael 1988:Plate 8; Wolfe 1981 :3,44 45,49).

Among the three wooden objects found alongside the body, the longer appear to be shafts of spear throwers, and the shorter, a knife handle, although blades were not present. Textile analysis. A cotton textile partially enveloped the body and was fastened around the feet of the individual with cotton cordage. The shroud was constructed from four fragments of cloth; all are sim- ple plain weaves. Two fragments of a pale plaid were mended together and attached to two other fragments without design. According to Grace Katterman, who analyzed the materials, following Emery (1980), a balanced plain weave technique (simple warp-weft structure) was employed in the manufacture. The textile conforms to a style manufactured dur- ing Early Nasca, and as early as Paracas times, at PV62D13 and elsewhere (DeLeonardis 1997:144; Phipps 1989; Wallace 1979). Plain, unadorned bur- ial shrouds are common in Nasca burial contexts (Carmichael 1988:495; Silverman 1993:216). A small swatch of fish net, manufactured of plant fiber, was recovered from the interior of the body shroud. Emery (1980) refers to the technique as "knotted looping" or knotted netting, which is a simple knotting technique typical of fish net. The net may have been a fisherman's tool or, given the size, a keepsake. Temporal context. At the time of excavation, chronological placement of the burial was assessed on the basis of the ceramic bowl stylistically associ- ated with Nasca 3. The bowl shape, use of color, design, and design placement and execution, all con- form to the Nasca 3 style as it is presently defined (Blasco and Ramos 1980; Kroeber 1956; Kroeber and Collier 1998; Proulx 1968, 1970). Two samples were submitted for radiocarbon analysis. Absolute dates would provide a chronolog- ical anchor for the burial, as well as for Nasca Phase 3 in the IcaValley. A sample of carbonized textile and a sample of carbonized flesh were submitted to Beta Analytical Laboratories in Miami. The samples were tested by Accelerated Mass Spectrometty (AMS). There were no indications of contamination reported by the laboratory and there was a sufficient amount of carbon to obtain valid results. Both dates corre- spond to others reported for Nasca 3. Oneradiocarbon measurement (Beta 129679; car- bonized flesh; bl3C = -23.7) produced an uncali- brated date of 1760+/-50 B.P., and a two-sigma (p = 95%) calendaryearrangeofcalA.D.135 to405 with</page><page sequence="10">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 372 the Pretoria Calibration Procedure Program. The date conforms with others for Nasca 3 in the Nasca region as reported by Silverman ( 1993 :39, Table 3 .1). A sec- ond measurement (Beta 120040; carbonized textile; 613C = -22.2) produced an uncalibrated range of 2100 + 40 B.P., and a two-sigma (p = 95%) calendar year range of cal 200 to 30 B.C. with the Pretoria Cali- bration Procedure Program. It was expected that dates from the same burial would cluster more closely. The calendar year dis- crepancy observed between the antiquity of the body and the textile corresponds to several gener- ations. One explanation that might account for the discrepancy is that the textile is an antique. If the textile is viewed as an heirloom, the gap between the dates is less prohibitive; that an individual was interred in the shroud of a great-grandparent or older ancestor is not an unreasonable interpretation. Furthermore, Paracas-style textiles overlap with Nasca traditions in time and space through Early Intermediate Period 3 (Paul 1991:24; Rowe 1990-1991:107, 109). Forexample, Paul (1991:15, L-115) lists a radiocarbon date for a Paracas Necropolis-style cotton cloth from Pisco that ranges from A.D. 35455. Rowe (1990-1991:107) also raises the issue of mutual influences on textile styles between Cahuachi and Pisco during Early Nasca. The early date obtained for the textile also may be the result of the several textile pieces sewn together, as described previously. Technically, each of the pieces could yield different dates if they are an amalgam of cloth produced at different times. Obtaining a radiocarbon date from another part of the textile is a future course of action to address this possibility. Summary The burial excavated at PV62D 13 represents the only intact Early Nasca headless individual buried in an extended posture excavated to date, and raises ques- tions about the individual as well as the practice of interring the headless. In terms of Early Nasca grave wealth, this individual possessed some degree of prestige. Although eight of nine vessels were fash- ioned from gourds, as opposed to ceramic vessels, the fact that nine vessels accompanied the individ- ual is impressive. Gourds may have been substituted for ceramics, but nevertheless accommodated cus- tom. The presence of spear shafts, fish net, and other miniature tools have been associated with social sta- tus in other Nasca contexts and lend support to this premise (Caxmichael 1988:313-314; 1998:222-223; Silverman 1993:217, nl). There are two aspects of this particular burial that are noteworthy: the posture of the body and the location in a non-cemetery setting. As was discussed in the previous section, Early Nasca burials were typ- ically entombed in a seated, flexed position, and often placed in burial urns that were interred in cemeteries. Extended burials are known, but are rare; these rare cases are not headless (Silverman 1993: 195; 1997:450). It is reasonable to assert that the extended posture is intentional and meaningful, given the importance of body posture in Nasca mor- tuary practice. The location of the burial is similarly striking. That an individual would be buried alone in a non- cemetery setting is significant, especially since there are no indications that the individual was diseased. Early Nasca cemeteries are present in the region, from Callango and Ocucaje in the Ica Valley through Palpa and the Rfo Grande de Nasca Drainage. Within 100 meters south of PV62D13 in Callango, a Nasca 3 cemetery was identified by Cook in her survey, which strongly suggests that burial space was avail- able in the vicinity (Cook 1994). The site itself, long- abandoned by its Paracas inhabitants, must have had some sort of significance for Nasca peoples whether it be an ancestral home, a territory to be acquired, or a sacred space. Verano (1995:199-200) points out the practice of dedicatory burial among the Moche and Chimu; individuals were interred with presti- gious offerings, but in non-cemetery settings such as sub-floors, courtyards, and other architectural fea- tures, to commemorate abuilding orevent. Similarly, Davies (1984:214) cites examples of both Old World and New World dedicatory sacrifice to honor a new building construction and/or to appease the local spirits dwelling there. Of Bodies and Heads: Comparative Contexts Early Nasca Headless Burials Comparative examples of other Nasca headless buri- als elucidate the uniqueness of the PV62D13 case yet suggest that variations among the headless are discernable. I have identified three forms for the bur- ial of Early Nasca headless individuals: 1) burial in which the body is interred in a seated and flexed posi- tion, with grave offerings and head-replacement</page><page sequence="11">Table 1.

DeLeonardis] THE BODY CONTEXT: INTERPRETING EARLY NASCA DECAPITATED BURIALS 373 objects; 2) burial in which the body is interred in a seated and flexed position, but without grave offer- ings; and 3) burial in which the body is interred in an extended position, with grave offerings and head- replacement objects (the burial at PV62D13). Gen- der and age were considered, but were not consistently reported in the literature, thereby limit- ing their utility to the analysis. It is hoped that addi- tional forms may be added to this scheme, as they are reported (e.g., an extended individual without grave goods, or extended female adult without grave goods). It is noteworthy that headless bodies are never interred in mass graves or "caches" like heads; the forms involve only individual burials. Since body posture and the presence or absence of grave offer- ings appear to be culturally significant during Nasca times (Carmichael 1988; Silverman 1993), these were the principal criteria considered in making the initial assessment (Table 1). As mentioned previ- ously, the only examples of headless burials that are considered for analysis are those with an intact, undisturbed context. Form 1. Several headless burials, of male and female adults and of children, appear to be cultur- ally typical burials except the corpse lacks a head. Two of Kroeber's 1926 burial excavations revealed such a trend. In his excavations of Grave 16 at the Upper Cantayo Cax stucture, the burial of a child, swathed in cloth and interred on a bed of pacae leaves, was encountered (Kroeber and Collier 1998:72). A broken pot was interred with the burial and a jar fragment served as a head replacement object. In Grave 7 of the Aja B cemetery, Kroeber excavated an adult male interred with two fineware polychrome ceramic vessels and some braided hair fragments; a ceramic modeled head jar was situated in place of the head (Kroeber and Collier 1998:67). A mass of hair in the form of a turban is portrayed on the crown of the head (Kroeber and Collier 1998:118, Figure 154). Ubbelohde-Doering (1966:143) excavated a grave near Cahuachi that held an adult male that was wrapped in a fine embroidered cloth. A turban of red cord, draped with a cloth, was fashioned in place of the head. Interred with the burial was a polychrome jar bearing the image of a hummingbird. Two tombs excavated in 1956 by Aldo Rubini (1957) in the La Pena cemetery of Ocucaje contained headless bodies.4 An individual from Tomb 30 was interred in an urn accompanied by a molded ceramic vessel in the shape of a falcon, a broken gourd, a spin- dle whorl and a plain, dark brown bowl (Rubini 1957:56-57). The age and sex are not mentioned in Rubini's notes. Tomb 31 contained a young adult, also interred in an urn, and accompanied by two gourds (Rubini 1957:58). Form 2. Salvage excavations undertaken in 1995-1996 by the Instituto Nacional de Cultura-Ica during a road diversion project in the Palpa region involved the recovery of a number of Early Nasca burials at the Santa Rita cemetery. One headless indi- vidual interment of an adult whose sex has not yet been determined was excavated. The individual was interred in a Nasca 3-style ceramic urn without addi- tional grave offerings or head replacement objects (Mario Olaechea, personal communication 1999).</page><page sequence="12">374 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 Form 3. At Site PV62D13 in the Callango Region of the lower Ica Valley, the burial of a young male in an extended posture was excavated (DeLeonardis 1997:222). The body was wrapped in a textile and interred with a ceramic bowl, gourds, and spear shafts. This is the only reported example of this bur- ial form (see Case Study). Middle and Late Nasca Headless Burials What of the Middle and Late Nasca headless? In the search for published examples of Middle Nasca headless burials, none were encountered. Strong (1957:32) makes a passing reference, "One burial lacked a skull . . .", to a Middle Nasca burial in Bur- ial Areas 3 and 4 at Cahuachi, but in his field notes for Burial 3 he states: "The head was pushed forward off the spinal column," suggesting in situ damage, rather than decapitation (Silverman 1993:204). Only one Late Nasca headless burial, con- forming to Form 1, is reported. Lothrop and Mahler (1957:6) excavated a headless adult male burial in Cist 3 at Chavina. The individual was found seated and enshrouded in a cloth with an inverted gourd placed at the site of the head. Nasca 7 ceramics and a feathered textile were interred with the burial. Summary of Burial Forms The three interment forms of Nasca headless bodies reflect mortuary treatments that both conform to and deviate from the whole-body form. Forms 1 and 2 resemble a culturally typical setting, minus the head, while Form 3 suggests an elevated status, an offer- ing, and/or a dedication. When age and gender char- acteristics are considered in the examples where these factors are recorded, there does not appear to be any differential treatment among the three forms. The burial form observed most frequently is Form 1, a seated posture with grave goods. This form coin- cides with the most common whole-body interment pattern. When the data for headless bodies are viewed over time, we see variation in forms for Early Nasca times, a complete absence for Middle Nasca, when no headless burials have been recorded, and a single example for Late Nasca. Clearly, looting practices have impacted the Middle and Late Nasca headless body sample, but it is worthwhile to consider a fourth form, that is, destruction or eradication of the body after decapitation. Before addressing this possibil- ity, it is useful to consider burial forms for disem- bodied heads, and the visual imagery of both the head and body. Disembodied Head Interments Can similar burial forms be discerned for disem- bodied heads? Do these forms change over time? A number of scholars have attempted to record the location and burial characteristics of Nasca disem- bodied heads with firm proveniences and dates (Baraybar 1987; Browneetal.1993; Penteado 1972; Silverman 1993; Verano 1995). Tables 2 and 3 were compiled from consistent data available in the literature in an effort to address the question of burial forms for Nasca heads.5 The cri- teria used to determine a form placement of the head (in a grave, pit, or architectural feature), and presence or absence of grave goods6 were examined along with age and gender characteristics. The num- ber of heads per interment is also a consideration since head burials, unlike headless bodies, are cached. Based on the above criteria, four forms are evi- dent: 1) individual heads with grave offerings; 2) individual heads without grave offerings; 3) cached heads (more than 1 head) without grave offerings; and 4) cached heads with grave offerings (Tables 2 and 3). The most prevalent form for Early Nasca head burials, as Browne et al. (1993:287) suggest, is Form 1, individual interment in cemeteries with offerings (Table 2). Cached examples, with (Form 4) and with- out offerings (Form 3), are also noted. Form 1 is also the most common burial form for headless bodies during Early Nasca times. By Middle and Late Nasca (Table 3), caches con- taining greater numbers of heads are apparent (Form 3 and 4). Also, we see a greater number of forms where no grave offerings are attributed. Browne et al. (1993 :287) suggest that fewer heads were taken during Early Nasca in comparison to Middle and Late Nasca and that head burials occurred more frequently in cemetery settings during Early Nasca. While I agree with their assessment of Early Nasca heads, I would add that burials of cached heads increased in Middle and Late Nasca, but over time, caching almost always occurred without burial offer- ings. This change in the numbers of heads buried together suggests a change in attitude toward the burial treatment of caches, and may be indicative of</page><page sequence="13">Table 2.

DeLeonardis] THE BODY CONTEXT: INTERPRETING EARLY NASCA DECAPITATED BURIALS 375 Table 3. Middle and Late Nasca Disembodied Heads The Visual Imagery of Dismbodied Heads and Headless Bodies The iconography of disembodied heads that pre- dominates Late Paracas and Nasca art has captured the attention of scholars and has generated interpre- tive debate over the relationship between the physi- cal evidence and the images that are portrayed. Disembodied head depictions are so ubiquitous on Nasca ceramics that one art historian notes that "any the broader context in which the heads were taken. What is apparent in this examination of head buri- als is that like headless bodies, variable treatment is accorded to the head at the time of its burial. We can appreciate the contrast between a single head interred in a cemetery grave with offerings (e.g., Kroeber and Collier 1998:49) to a mass burial of heads placed in a pit without offerings (e.g., Browne et al. 1993:27F294), and the meaning(s) attributed to this variation.</page><page sequence="14">376 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 11, No. 4, 2000 Images of Headless Bodies Incidences of headless bodies in Early Nasca painted ceramic imagery are nearly absent, even though they are suggested by the radically disjointed neck-body posture of some human figures (e.g., Jimenez and Reid 1986:113). One Early Nasca example is illus- trated in Figure 10. A condor is shown in the process of consuming a human body. The head is absent and only the ribs are depicted. In most other Early Nasca contexts, the bird consumes disembodied heads, lungs, and other body parts (see Cornejo et al. 1996:27; Peters 1991 :273; Wolfe 1981 :Figures 60-75). A second example (Figure 11) shows two decapitators dressed in tunics and headgear. One decapitator is shown grasping the hair of a victim whose stomach has been struck by a dart, while the other decapitator holds the hair locks of a disem- bodied head. By Middle Nasca, the human body is portrayed on painted ceramics both in the context of zoomor- phic creatures and in the context of combat with otherhumans. In one example (Figure 12), a whole- body human, at the moment of decapitation, enters the jaws of an anthropomorphic killer whale, head f¢st. Other depictions of this creature (e.g., Cordy- Collins and Nicholson 1979:Figure 201) show it devouring only the head. The Masked Being (Fig- ure 9), another consumer of disembodied heads, is shown pulling apart a human figure. Late Nasca decapitation imagery often involves pairs of human figures, portrayed in decapitation scenes. One rendition (Figure 13) that covers both sides of a modeled double-spout and bridge vessel shows a series of pairedfigures. The decapitatordons a bird impersonator costume, while the male victim is shown without regalia, clutching the mask of the impersonator, or perhaps his own (see also Proulx 1989:Figure 9; Verano l995:Figure 11). In a second example (Figure 14), a nalced, headless corpse is shown in the context of darts and spears while two clothed figures grasp the hair of their naked com- batants.7 In Figure 15, an in-progress decapitation is shown in a panoramic arrangement. In one view, two males, a decapitator and a victim, face each other (not illustrated). The victim holds a feather standard in one hand, while his free hand is grasped by the decap- itator. A second view (Figure 15a) shows the decap- itator grasping the victim's arm and pulling off his headgear. A third view (Figure 15b) shows the decap- blank space becomes a trophy head by the mere addi- tion of three dots or lines" (Blagg 1975: 13). Archae- ologists have relied heavily on Nasca iconography to make sense of the physical evidence and the activ- ities associated with head-taking (Carmichael 1994; Paul 2000; Proulx 1989; Roark 1965; Sawyer 1966; Tello 1918). There is a general consensus that Early Nasca disembodied-head iconography appears most frequently associated with agricultural motifs and fertility themes. The common association of heads with manifestations of growth and renewal depicted by icons such as plants and seeds is undeniable. Heads are also personified as the source of life, shown by plant sprouts emerging from the head itself (Sawyer 1966:Figure 209) (Figure 9). Modeled ceramic jars in the form of a head often act as head replacements in headless burials. Disembodied head icons are also found on the swollen abdomen of female ceramic figurines (Morgan 1988:Plate 1 no. 4), and sculptural miniatures in gold are known (Lechtman 1996:Figure 9). A visual array of decap- itators the Anthropomorphic Masked Being, the Trophy Head Taster, the Horrible Bird, the Killer Whale, and the Harvester are all judged to be col- laborators in the greater scheme of the fertile and vio- lent Nasca cosmology (Blagg 1975; Carmichael 1994: 83; Proulx 1989:73-75; Roark 1965; Townsend 1985; Wolfe 1981). In contrast to the ubiquitous heads that predom- inate Nasca art over time, the human body is infre- quently represented, especially on Early Nasca painted ceramics. Depictions of headless bodies are extremely limited overall, although a greater num- ber appear in Late Nasca art. Aside from painted ceramics, whole-form humans are expressed in ceramic figurines (Morgan 1988), fully costumed textile figures (Horie 199&gt;1991 ; Rowe 199s1991), textile borders (Cornejo et al. 1996:37), modeled ceramic jars (Blasco and Ramos 1980; Seler 1961), and geoglyphs (Reindel et al. 1999), although these too, are comparatively small in number. More com- mon for early period painted ceramics are depictions of fantastic two-dimensional anthropomorphic and zoomorphic creatures dressed in masks and cos- tumes, normally decorated with, or in the process of consuming or "tasting," disembodied heads. By Mid- dle Nasca we see an increase in the number of human figures shown on painted ceramics, and by Late Nasca, these figures are portrayed in a series of com- plex scenes engaged in the act of decapitation.</page><page sequence="15"> DeLeonardis] THE BODY CONTEXT: INTERPRETING EARLY NASCA DECAPITATED BURIALS 377 Figure 13: Detail, Late Nasca, scene of in-progress decapi- tation.

Late Nasca decapitation images also include anthropomorphic and zoomorphic creatures, and birds that devour both heads and bodies (e.g., Seler 1961:Abb. 334). Figure 17 shows birds attack- ing an individual who has been decapitated. Together with Figure 10, these images suggest scavenging and/or mutilation in conjunction with decapitation, a phenomenon documented on the Peruvian North Coast (see Verano 1986). Other examples of Late Nasca images show a decapitation in-progress portrayed on a double-spout Figure 12: Middle Nasca, Anthropomorphic Killer Whale consuming human body.

Since the imagery of decapitation has long been approached with pnnci- pal concern for disembodied heads, I approach this analysis in terms of what the images suggest in terms of body contexts. I preface my remarks with the recognition that Nasca art is metonymical in expres- sion, and that it may not be possible to interpret all levels of meaning. Yet, the very presence of decapi- tated body imagery in the overall context of Nasca art suggests it was meaningful and intended to be read by some segment of a viewing audience. I also rec- ognize that the images portrayed on ceramics are one of many media by which Nasca artists expressed or symbolized their universe. With that in mind, I sug- gest other forms of visual art that may help to rec- oncile problems in assessing archaeological body contexts. In light of the present sample that consists mostly of Late Nasca images, I call attention to three prominent variables that I judge to be appropriate to the focus of the discussion at hand: the vessel forms in which the images are portrayed, the overall design theme, and clothing. Vessel fot7ns. On painted ceramics, decapitated body imagery is limited to fineware vessel forms such as polychrome double-spout and bndge bottles, and vases. Moreover, the limited number of vessels exhibiting these images is equally important because unlike the popular iconography of disembodied heads that was widely available to Nasca society, the audience for these pieces must have been limited to a narrower segment. Overall design considerations. Decapitation imagery occupies a prominent space on the ceramic vessel, unlike disembodied heads which are often secondary elements in a particular design. We also have to consider, especially among Late Nasca ren- ditions, that other elements of the decapitation scene such as disembodied heads, darts, stylized hair locks, clothing, and abstract objects contnbute to the mean- ing of the decapitation "story." For example, a tunic is often shown in place of an actual decapitated body in combat scenes (Figures lSb and 18; see also Proulx 1994:Figure 5). I*he time of decapitation, or the agency of an event, is expressed as in-progress (Figures 11 and 13), a completed action (Figures 1s11 , 14, 1S17), or a suggested action (Figures 12 and 18). Decapitation imagery involves bodies shown alone or with other headless bodies (Figures 10, 12, 1S17),orinrepeatedpairswithotherhuman Figure 15: Detail, Late Nasca, decapitation scene. aS upper: combatant seizes head gear of victim. b, lower: combatant seizes head of victim.

(from Townsend 1985:Figure 16). figures (Figures 13-15). Decapitated bodies are shown facing forward (Figures 11,12, and 14), back- ward (Figure 10), or in profile (Figure 16). While these details may pertain, in part, to the design con- siderations of the painter, it is likely that they are linked to the broader message conveyed by the image. Clothing. Clear distinctions in the clothing worn by the victim and the decapitator are observable in Nasca decapitation imagery. The basic apparel por- trayed involves men's clothing: a loincloth with belt or sash, a tunic, headgear, and a cape or manta. The victims of decapitation are portrayed in three forms: without clothing (Figures 10 and 14), wearing only a loincloth or belt (Figures 11-12, and 16-17), or dressed, but in the process of losing their clothes and hat (Figures 13 and 15). Loss of head, combined with loss of clothing, is a consistent theme in Nasca decapitation imagery. Among the Moche of north- ern Peru, victims of human sacrifice are also scant- ily clad males in contrast to the regalia worn by the agent of decapitation (e.g., Donnan 1997:Figures 4 and 6; Uceda et al. 1997). There appears to be fairly uniform apparel among the decapitators shown in combat scenes holding standards, darts, knives, and spears, an observation also noted by others (Blasco and Ramos 1980; Carmichael 1994; Proulx 1989, 1994; Townsend 1985). These figures are dressed minimally in a loin- cloth with sash andheadgear (Figure 15). More often, the combatant is dressed in a tunic that is either sleeveless (Figure 11), short-sleeved (Figures 14 and 18), or long-sleeved (Figure 13). Headgear consists of a simple cap with neck and ear flaps, some of which are further decorated (e.g., Figure 14). The variation observed among loincloths, tunics, and hat shapes may signify different ethnic groups (e.g., Rod- man 1992), political rank (e.g., Cook 1992), or dif- ferent roles played by these individuals in decapitation activities. The most elaborate apparel is worn by decapita- tors in non-combat scenes (Figure 13; Rossel Cas- tro 1977: Figure 31). Along with the standard loincloth and sash, these costumes include long sleeved tunics, capes or mantas, animal pelt stoles, and elaborate headgear. Missing from these scenes is the background of weaponry. In its place, the decapitator's manta and headgear fills the space. In one example (Rossel Castro 1977: Figure 31), head- gear of the victim is strewn about. Both Paul (1990:85-89), and Anawalt (1984:166-170) have called attention to these impersonator costumes in the context of human sacrifice. In reference to Late Paracas/Early Nasca impersonator costumes, Paul (1990:99) suggests that these both reflected the social status of the individual as well as their role in the rit- ual embodied in the imagery of the textile. Given the significance of clothing in the ancient Andes generally (e.g., Murra 1962), and its careful portrayal in Nasca art, it is reasonable to infer that Nasca ceramic painters conveyed messages about events such as decapitation through the clothing wom</page><page sequence="18">380 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 by the participants. Both Dwyer and Dwyer (1975:160) and Townsend (1985:132) have noted that human anatomical detail often is secondary to the particulars accorded to masks and costume. Soustelle (1984:4) addresses the concept of drama conveyed in human sacrifice and refers to a kind of "liturgical theater" conveyed by costume and the actions of the figures. The transformation from mun- dane human to one endowed with an altered identity is conveyed by costume, and it appears that a loss of clothing also signals the transformation in identity that takes place at the time of death, and in this case, decapitation. Images and Contexts Decapitation scenes provide a strong foundation to interpret head-taking contexts. On one end of the spectrum, decapitation of prisoners of war or social outcasts is suggested. On the other end of the spec- trum, and in the absence of military regalia, ceremony is implied by depictions of impersonators or digni- taries. Between these extremes, warfare is a promi- nent theme, especially in Late Nasca renditions where equally dressed combatants battle for the head and feather standard of the other. In short, both mil- itary conquest and ceremonial decapitation are pre- dominant themes. These depictions, represented on a limited number of vessels, may well be commem- orative histories of individuals and/or events. When we attempt to reconcile these images with archaeo- logical data, there is a sound correspondence between the young, male warrior profile (Verano 1995:214) and the imagery. Similarly, high status tombs con- taining the costumes, scepters, headgear, and other ritual paraphernalia link living dignitaries to the images. Decapitation imagery provides fewer clues about the disposition of the body after decapitation although mutilation by scavengers or consumption of the complete body by zoomorphic creatures is depicted. Head contexts are also few although one image depicts display (Blasco and Ramos 1980:Lamina XLVII), while another depicts a cache of heads buried beneath a pyramidal structure (Proulx 1994:Figure 18). Clearly, portrayal of the disposi- tion of heads and bodies was secondary to portrayal of contexts involving head-taking, especially since the archaeological evidence indicates that both bod- ies and heads were eventually buried. While the relationship between the archaeologi- cal evidence and the images portrayed on certain ceramlc vessels may seem disjunctive, other ceramic forms, such as the modeled head jar, may provide a better route to locating decapitated bodies, or at least may provide an estimate of how many there may have been. These jars, found from Nasca 3 onward, con- sist of modeled and painted heads with faces por- trayed alive (eyes open) or as a disembodied head (eyes facing upward with spines through the lips) (Blasco and Ramos 1980; Gayton and Kroeber 1927; Kroeber 1956; Proulx 1968; Strong 1957). Hats, headgear, and feather headdresses are portrayed, as are facial markings such as paint or tatoos, eyebrows, and facial hair (Gayton and Kroeber 1927:Plate 7). On the basis of Kroeber's data from the Nasca region, Blasco and Ramos (1980:161) argue that modeled head jars shown with open eyes served as head replacements in burials. Certainly, Kroeber's exca- vation of the headless burial atAja B, Grave 7 is com- pelling evidence (Kroeber and Collier 1998:67, Figure 154). At Ocangalla West B, Graves 3 and 7, these jars were also recovered in place of articulated skeletons, described by Kroeber as "disintegrated bones" (Kroeber and Collier 1998:59, Figures 226 and 239). At Ocangalla West B, Grave 4, Kroeber recovered two modeled head jars resembling dis- embodied heads in a tomb that contained no human remains (Kroeber and Collier 1998:59, Figures 229 and 230). In other burial contexts, the modeled head jars are found with whole-body burials (Kroeber and Collier 1998:166; Strong 1957:35, Figure 14e), or details about the burials are lacking entirely (Blasco and Ramos 1980:Laminas XXXIX-XLV; Gayton and Kroeber 1957:6, Plate 7; Kroeber and Collier 1998:300, Figure 237; Seler 1961:Abbs. 138-149, 151-158). Whether the jars "replaced" a living head or dis- embodied trophy head, if we speculate that each jar represents one person, it might be possible to esti- mate headless or absent bodies based on the number of extant jars in museum and private collections. This estimate would still be low because as we know fromPV62D13 and some ofthe otherexamples listed in Table 1, some Nasca burials contained head replacement objects other than jars, and some con- tained no head replacement objects. Of Heads, Bodies, and Images For all Nasca times, disembodied heads, in physical form and in visual representations, outnumber head-</page><page sequence="19"> u l l [ -l  DeLeonardis] THE BODY CONTEXT: INTERPRETING EARLY NASCA DECAPITATED BURIALS 381 70- 63 eo- 50- 40 30 20 1Q 30 o EARLY NASCA MIDDLE NASCA LATE NASCA 2 HEADS Figure 19: Bar graph showing diachronic proportions of Nasca heads to headless bodies. less bodies. The stark contrast between the number of heads proportionate to bodies over time is illus- trated in Figure 19. On painted ceramics, the visual imagery of bod- ies is scarce over time. By Middle and Late Nasca, human forms are more frequently represented as are actual decapitation scenes, but again, these are limited in number, and presumably restricted to a narrow audience, perhaps only to the decapitators themselves. The combined archaeological data and visual imagery point squarely to the impor- tance of the head and the cultural propaganda that promoted it as the object of veneration, the seed of fertility, and the life-force essence in Nasca society. Given the paucity of headless burials during Mid- dle and Late Nasca, at a time when the visual imagery depicts decapitation and the number of actual heads is greatest, it is tempting to speculate that over time, the headless body was culturally de-emphasized. Yet we have evidence for formal burials of some head- less individuals, and Nasca artists did depict head- less bodies, perhaps more frequently than other Precolumbian Andean cultures who also practiced human sacrifice (Cordy-Collins 1992:208). If we consider modeled head jars as replacements for heads or absent bodies, we can also project that, in some form, perhaps symbolically, headless bodies and other victims of human sacrifice received interment. Clearly, the sample bias, which favors heads over bodies, precludes further assessment. Returning to the data at PV62D13 and other examples cited in the literature, it is useful to sum- marize mortuary trends over time by comparing intact headless burials with whole-body burials and disembodied heads. For Early Nasca, headless bod- ies, disembodied heads, and whole-body burial inter- ments are closely linked in that almost all are interred in cemeteries. We also see one dedicatory head bur- ial found in architecture at Cahuachi (Table 2), and one dedicatory headless body at PV62D13 (Table 1), clearly not pertaining to a cemetery context. By Middle Nasca, disembodied heads are found in greater numbers and in a variety of settings. Caches of heads are more frequent, as is the number of heads per cache. Two dedicatory heads are recorded for Cahuachi, and a cache of 48 heads is recorded for Cerro Carapo. There have been no reported burials of headless bodies, but a number of aberrant interments, perhaps victims of human sacrifice, are found at Cahuachi (Silverman 1993:215) and Cerro Carapo (Browne et al. 1993:280-283. Among whole-body burials, a shift occurs with a notable increase in grave wealth among a smaller segment of the population, signaling an emerging elite (Carrnichael 1998:226; Isla 1992). Through Late Nasca, disembodied head interment trends follow their Middle Nasca counter- parts, and only one headless burial has been recorded. I LL L BODIES</page><page sequence="20">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000 382 that conceptual linkages do occur. Whether or not the head is attached to the body, heads and bodies are subject to a culturally defined burial in the man- ner of whole bodies. For example, we may not be able to match the child's head with the child's body at the Upper Cantayo site where each was buried sep- arately on pacae leaves (Tables 2 and 3), but it is clear that both head and body receive a proper interment. This is not to imply that the heads and bodies of all children will receive the same treatment, but simply that each will be interred in a manner appropriate to that individual. A second issue, whether one can link decapita- tion motive to the type of burial headless bodies receive, cannot be resolved, but indeed the burial patterns of headless bodies offer more information than the heads alone. During the Early Nasca period, headless bodies receive equal or better treatment than whole-body interments. While it may not be possi- ble to pinpoint decapitation motive for the extended burial at PV62D13 or at other sites, it is reasonable to assert that decapitation posed no threat to the indi- vidual's status. In the case of the PV62D13 burial, social status, owing to bravery in combat, a puberty rite, or sacrifice to a new shrine, may have been ele- vated as a result. Bloch and Parry (1982:38) discuss the near uni- versal concept that fertility is created out of death, a belief that certainly holds true in Andean cosmology. In their view, "good deaths" (self-sacrifice, natural causes) result in proper burials and regeneration while "bad deaths" (criminal acts, suicides) do not result in regeneration (1982:15-18). It is critical to note that there are no "bad deaths" recorded for the headless during Early Nasca times as discussed above. However, after the abandonment of Cahuachi during Nasca 4, the first "bad deaths" are recorded indicating an abrupt change in attitude toward whole- body treatment at death. Concurrent with this change is an increase in the number of disembodied heads. One could argue that head-taking had evolved from an occasional sacrifice to a more widely practiced tactic of warfare, "ritual" or otherwise. I propose that the data do indicate a change in attitude toward the body that had its precedents in Early Nasca times, but they cannot be reduced to simple explanations of motive. What the data accentuate is the paramount importance of the head as life-force, and perhaps the secondary nature of the body without it. When we compare whole-body interments to headless body and disembodied heads over time, it can be argued that head taking increases over time, concurrent with its depiction in the visual imagery. Given the glaring absence of headless bodies for Nasca 5, it is obvious that modern looting has con- tributed to this sampling bias. We cannot rule out that scavenging and outright destruction of bodies also occurred, especially since we have documented cases of scattered bone burials and empty tombs. Dispo- sition trends of both heads and bodies suggest that some are dedicatory while others are interred in cul- turally typical settings such as cemeteries. Combined with the visual imagery that depicts head-taking, these data must reflect the variable contexts in which head-taking occurred. Conclusions Scholarship wavers between interpretations of head- taking although few would dispute that throughout Andean prehistory, the head itself represented a pro- found symbol of power closely linked to concepts of life, death, and fertility. While the practice of head- taking appears in many cases to be linked with con- quest (Harner 1972; Murphy and Murphy 1974:80; Rowe 1946:279; Tello 1918:2s25), ultimately the heads were considered to be a source of spiritual pro- tection against an enemy, rather than a souvenir of war. In less competitive contexts, such as among contemporary indigenous people of the highland regions, the skull of an ancestor positioned in a store- house is thought to protect the provisions (Allen 1988:59). For the Aymara, the human head, uma, is the point of entry and exit for the human self (Bastien 1978:47). The head-fertility metaphor is practically a universal concept (Davies 1984) that need not be considered static in its expression. In Nasca art and archaeology it was conveyed through images of the natural world and inextricably linked with cultural drama, ritual, combat, and power relationships. It is clear that Nasca headless bodies, while rare, are interred in meaningful patterns and these patterns hold promise for inferring Nasca decapitation prac- tices. The first question that arises is whether each form of headless body interment mirrors a similar treatment for the head. I propose that the patterns associated with Early Nasca headless burials do reflect similar patterns among the heads. The aim is not to match heads with bodies but rather to suggest</page><page sequence="21">DeLeonardis] THE BODY CONTEXT: INTERPRETING EARLY NASCA DECAPITATED BURIALS 383 Acknowledgements.

F. 1981 The Spotted Cat and the Horrible Bird: Stylistic Change in Nasca 1-5 Ceramic Decoration. Nawpa Pacha 19:142. Notes 1. Nasca is spelled with an "s" or "z." For purposes here, I favor the "s" spelling. 2. Nasca 1 is grouped with Ocucaje Phases 9 and 10, refer- ring to Paracas material culture. Nasca Phase 8 is thought to be strongly influenced by the Wari culture of highland Ayacucho, while Phase 9 is considered a Wari style (Silverman 1988, 1993). 3. The sternum, a spongy bone, probably disintegrated with ground contact. 4.While the Ocucaje burials are considered Proto Nasca, they are included here to demonstrate the continuity between Late Paracas and Early Nasca burials. 5. Tello's data (three examples), from Salinas and Coyungo (1918:30-33) were omitted for lack of consistent information about the heads. 6. Disembodied heads are sometimes wrapped in a textile or buried upon a bed of leaves. While these factors are considered in the analysis of forms, they are not recognized as offerings per se. 7. The photograph of this Nasca 7 vessel that appears in Proulx (1989:Figure 11), should be attributed to Catalog 171355 of the Field Museum, Chicago. A photograph of the complete vessel is shown in Kroeber and Collier (1998:Figure 316).</page></plain_text>
