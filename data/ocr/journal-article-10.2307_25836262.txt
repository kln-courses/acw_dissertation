MELANESIAN GODS There are probably no people on the earth who do not have something quite particular to themselves in their view of their god^s), and become critical of themselves and of others as soon as they become aware of the diffe rences involved. Others then are judged ff*om each onefs own standpoint, and prejudices abound in what otherwise might seem detached scholarly investigations. Such flaws showed up when early missionaries sometimes used biblical and theological categories to draw together what evidence was found in particular societies in the endeavour to fit them into their critical framework. The same happens when indiginous theologians nowadays emphasize that "what sver the bible can tell us about God was said earlier, and bet ter, by their own ancestors. In fact, one African scholar is quoted as saying of the Christian message: "11 nfy a rien, rien, rien de nouveau!" In both instances we witness apologetic tendencies at work, although in different di rections. In honouring Father G. HULSTAERT we cannot forget his penetrating studies on the Bantu religion: they date</page><page sequence="2">358 ~ bac k to the period between 1936 and 1968, although only recent ly have we received the (ripe ,fruit of his lifelong reflections* (1) Our modest contribution to his celebra tion cannot match the painstaking and necessary detail shown in his Kkundo studies, yet it is inspired by the author's non-apologetic approach? Even though this essay touches upon anthropological and biblical material it will try to not confuse these two poles of interest* The main aim of the study is to show that, in Melanesia, several concepts of ^rod are founds culture heroes9 dema deities, skygods, with a whole host of masalai and tamberaru Awareness of the various ties of these models with the people*s cultural configurations in particular will warn us against instant identifications with the biblical or Christian God* Yet.the same insight/will invite us to ap preciate in traditional'religion various elements of las ting value* The question will be asked whrt;her#, in good conscience, we can relegate the Melanesian gods to the ca tegory of the idols of biblical religion* I. BETWEEN POLYTHEISM AM) MONOTHEISM Bible history starts with the persons of Abraham and Moses* The Patriarch was called to leave his home country (Gen 12,1) and the Lawgiver brought the Israelites to the border of the promised land* Only to Moses God revealed himself as Jahweh, since before that time the Isra elites only knew him as El Shaddai (EX 6,3)* The monothe ism of these early periods was far from ideals we only have to recall that Abraham's parents were worshippers of idols*, (Jos 24,2$ Jdg 5? 6-9)t and that even Moses was brought up at the pagan court of Egypt (Ex 2,10) and later married the daughter of a Midianite priest (2,21)f and that it took centuries and all the efforts of the prophets before one reaches the lofty ideas of a Deutero-Isaiah* His pure and explicit monotheism and his belief in an almighty and transcendent creator-god is not a starting point, but an end product* (2) In addition it took further centuries before Jesus and Paul and John gave us their understanding of God, and once more several centuries were needed before</page><page sequence="3">- 359 - the church had sorted out some "basic Christological and trinitarian problems. Even today experiments are being made to update the Western understanding of the Christian God. Pacing the facts squarely, one must admit that there were various stages in the biblical understanding of the monotheism, ranging from the friendly family god of the patriarch to the fierce warrior of the Judges, from the graet king in the time of the monarchy and the creator of the universe after the exil, till the Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament era. The opposite pole to monotheism was a world with "Many gods and many Lords" (1 Cor 8,5),conveniently defi ned as polytheism and idolatry , In this configuration too the gods were personal beings who received a cultic veneration, and who were able to influence matters of interest for their respective worshippers. Such "gods" were not, and never had bean "humans"; their existence - in the minds of their religious subjects - did not de pend on any human activity, while their influence had no spiritual, temporal or functional limits (BRELICH 1960 , 126). It was because native monotheism and foreign poly theism spoke somewhat the same language that historically the two systems could come to terms. Later on the know ledge of this confrontation provided scholars with a frame work to understand all religions, and this happened not only among churchmen, but in the human sciences as well. The early cultural anthropologists, as A. COMTE and E.B. TYLOR, believed that polytheism and monotheism were stages pf one great evolutionary process, mutually linked in a straight line, while all religious expressions which did not meet the first mark - either because their object was not personal or because it was limited in its activities - were relegated to the realm of fetishism and animism, that is, respectively: the worship of man made things or the veneration of some kind of spirit. In time other students of religion developed further distinc tions, which are known as, e.g? dynamism for the worship of powers of nature which wexenot (yet) personified (3)f</page><page sequence="4">~ 360 ~ or also henotheism (i*e* one-god-worship) for the stage of evolution, justbelow monotheism (i*e* unique-god-worship) j in this henotheistio case people (still) admitted many gods, hut cared only about one of them (4)? Another school of anthropology , headed by A* LANG and W. SCHMIDTf admitted the internal logic of the foregoing theory, but contested the direction in which it was opera tive* Its scholars at tempt ed to adduce historical proofs that monotheism was not the final result of a long evolu tion, but stood at the very roots of the development, and it was found in its purest form among the most primitive societies* Phenomena which did not suit this second theory were accounted for as later degenerations or as abandon ments of the primeval purity of the belief revealed at the beginning of the human history. As indicated earlier - quoting the example of the bible - monotheism is not a monolithic concept, and it has withnessed different stages during the time of Israelfs changeover from semi-nomadism to the settled life^in Canaan In this and other cases, polytheism is not the necessary stage from which it might emerge* In fact, polytheism is often a kind of end product, and one which is not every where the same* Polytheistic systems apparently succeed other religious models, traces of which - as in the roman religion - are totally obliterated, or (and this is the rule) are able to be detected only within the intricacies of highly elaborate mythologies* Again, the system of ma ny kgods is caracteristic of so called high cultures, both around Israel (such as in Old Egypt, Canaan and Babylonia) as elsewhere in the world (in such places as Old Peru, Ix* dia orJ&amp;pan). In other words: such systems are found con stantly among literate peoples with a rather advanced agri culture* This observation would suggest that the beliefs in and the worship of many gods particulary fits a certain cultural stage characterized by stratification of society, a high degree of specialization, and the possession of a certain level of economic security and independence ( BRELICH 1960, 133-134) (5) Today cultural anthropologists have become less</page><page sequence="5">- 361 - ambitious than their predecessors who swore by the evolu tionistic creed. They are convinced that the two tradi tional catchwords, polytheism and monotheism, are not sim ple concepts, and they are often satisfied to describe types of societies and types of religions, without attemp ting to establish any historical sequence. Reasons for such a stand are that known history is only &amp; fraction of total human history; further that contemporary primitive societies are chronologically speaking not primitive at all (6); and finally that in the course of time both a greater complexity as well as progressive simplification might have taken place. In addition, really to describe the facts encountered, older definitions might be totally inadequate so that new formulations may have to be attemp ted. The most their research allows then: to say is that some religious forms seem to be more congenial than others to a particular model of human society - as pointed out earlier with regard to polytheism. There is among researchers a large consensus re garding some basic types of human culture. These are rela ted, e.g. to the roles played by the different sexes. Prom this standpoint one can start with ; 1# A type of livings together which shows little or no sharing of tasks by men and women; this model occurs among early food-gatherers, where the man looks for game, and the woman collects tubers and fruits. #rom this undifferentiated stage one can logically construct two further models? 2. a form of culture in which the woman, instead of going after the plants, brings and cultivates them near her dwelling; this gives the model of an agri cultural life. One can also draw 3. a model in which the man, instead of chasing ani mals! tries to domesticate them, whereby he final ly becomes a cattlebreeder. Yet, if we look around ourselves, we see that 4. The roles played by both men and women are rather equally distributed, so that - with this fourth type of society - the circle is closed again ( Cf THIEL</page><page sequence="6">362 - 1977,45-70) the four types are not developmental or chronolo gical stages which apply everywhere and hold for all so cieties ^ or can be found whithout a mixture of one another? On the contrary, they are ideal schemes which might co exist, and to which the real living societies can be re lated* Coming to the Melanesian scene we should be aware that a chronological development can hardly be traced in any part of it* Written documents do not go back further than 400 years and oral traditions hardly reach 200 years back, and both usually do not answer the questions we would like to ask them (7)* No wonder that the Melanesians are still the victims of sweeping statements, and that one can still read that in matters of religionthey are animists, and that culturally they are simple horticulturalists, not knowing ploughs or cereals, and not unlike many people of the ancient Near East* In their* generality such opinions are falsev even for the traditional societies where ani mism and primitive agriculture are only two elements of a much wider religious and cultural spectrum* The polytheism of ancient high cultures is not found here* whatever one thinks of the neighbouring Polynesians? (8; But neither is traditionally understood monotheism functionally ade quate* One can not say that Mela nesians who lack belief in one God - as the Kiwai in Pa pua New Guinea (XANDTMANN 1917*13) or the iferind--Anim in West Irian (WIRZ 1922%II,18) ? would therefore lack any religion* As we shall see below they are religious people indeed, albeit geared towards a rather different worldvieW than the one found in the classical world religions0 In these and similar cases one should handle very carefully such theological terms as f?god** and tsupreme beingj% be cause the well known connotations of personality, active concern, immortality etc* may not apply to the various spirit beings in native myths and rituals* Again, this approach warns us not to attempt an organically construc ted "pantheon11 of gods such as fits the truly polytheistic system, e*g* of the ancient Romans? it cannot be presumed that such systematism fits other models of religion as well*</page><page sequence="7">- 363 - Finally the abandonment of a theistic, not to say a Chris tian frame of reference, might restore all kinds of cultic expressions to a more central place than the one they were relegated to in a God-centered type of understanding? All these points are advantages of a non^apologetic approach to Melanesian religibn. With these preliminary remarks, we might now turn to the first type of society, the one of early hunters and food-gatherers - also known als wildboou ters - whose religion is usually developed around the fi gure of a so called culture hero. Despite the title of this essay, they are not real gods though. He THE CULTURE HEROES The idea of creation which is so typical of monotheism is as a mile not present in early forms of religion; here we find rather superior beings who transform the world to what it is at present and give mankind - or a particular society - the valuable tools of its culture. We see here a spiritualistic outlook at work which is quite^differeht from the attitudes cultivated by modern societies. The lat ter speak proudly of their human "inventions", whereas ear lier societies derive their most valued institutions, tech niques, customs and laws from a "gift" of the gods, the spirits, the ancestors, etc. This was already so in Greek mythology. In ancient Greece the origin of human culture was to "heroes", a category of beings which, besides the gods and the demons, populated their mythology. These heroes ware not half-gods like the demons, but were instead humans of the primal history who became famous through their exeptio nal deeds, and who were sometimes divinized - after their death. Their main function was to open up human history, while the gods prop?r|3tayed aloof in their Olympic isola tion. Some of these famous heroes are Promotheus, who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to men, or Orpheus who taught humans the domestication of animals and gave them music, or Asclepeus, the originator of magic and medicine. Still other heroes instituted some feats or were founders of cities and peoples of which they were considered the ancestors. Of another type are heroes, like Heracles, who in order to achieve their culturally important feats had</page><page sequence="8">- 3 64 - to fight with monsters and to overcome, through cunning and force, superh\iman'difficulties# These heroes enjoyed their victories to the full and were not guided by ethical considerations, which is the reason why some of them may also he called "tricksters" Others again saved the peo ples to whom gods sent them from suffering and need, or from famine and floods* These are the "Saviours" proper, as e?g* Deucalion ~? the Greek counterpart of NSah - who with his wife survivea the (*Gr6ek) Deluge and thus stands at the beginnings of the second humanity* (9) Different elements from the respective legends seem to indicate that Greek heroes trace their origin from important historical figures and that?if "they aTre the object of any veneration, their cultic forms are associated with those of the ances torsg and not with those of the gods proper* Such then is the historical background of a concept which is widely u sed in Melanesian anthropology, without making it therefore the norm against which all non-Greek counterparts have to be measured (10) Since the beginning of this century anthropologists have become aware that many peoples, in particular North American Indians, African Nilotic peoples and Australian Aborigines, were acquainted with beings which closely re sembled the Greec saviours, tricksters and other culture heroes, and this view has since been extended to Melanesia as well (11 )* One point which received a major emphasis in these discussions is that these heroes are not creators of the world, and although some of them may be associated with the creator, others - such as tricksters - may be quite opposed to him; they often can assume the form of an animal, and they normally are not object of any^ vene ration* How does this model relate to Melanesia ? A minimal groupe of Melanesians might still be clas sified as food gathererss, whether they engage in hunting game, in fishing on the reefs, or in gathering fruits gro wing wild in the forest* The rugged geography of the New Guinea mainland makes it unlikely that these hunters would have covered vast territories, as e*g* some of the Austra lian Aborigines, although these letter, top, ware not pure nomads, and regurlarly came back to familiar water holes and there performed a regular ceremonial life* Evidence</page><page sequence="9">- 365 - of this simple form of hunters1 life is still found in so me of the old tales, where one hears, e.g., of making ho les to capture wild pigs (BLET 1914* 203)or of using bird lime &amp;nd slings to catoh birds (BLET 1914, 438,442). Such a life with all its display of cunning and ruse and with its admirable inventiveness, was nevertheless highly depen dent of factors which were not under human control. The great forst which was the place in which people "lived, and moved, and existed" ( of Act 17, 18), was their real benefactor, and it became quite naturally the object of awe and veneration* The game it provided was not unlimi ted, and so^metitaefc hard to find. Consequently, the forest (among the Bamtuti Itygmees) or the Guardian of the game (in some Aboriginal religions) had to remain well disposed or otherwise to be beseeched for help. To kill game causes these people a guilt complex, whereas among horticultural lists destruction and death is a sacred duty in order.to assure abundance and life (see below n. III). Among the pockets of Melanesians who engage in this style of life, elements of a hunter's outlook can be found. On example is the belief of the Mbowamb (New Mount Hagen) that rain is the tears of the sky people (t&amp;ewamb) who weep over the wild creatures which have been killed by men (VI CEDOM 1977, 8). The association of these sky-dwellers with fog and clouds shows however, that we have not here a pure form of forest mythology. Another instance is reported from the middle Sepik area, where some people have, as it were, personal relationships with some definite animals. Here one man explained? " I descend from a pig, and when our villagers for a long time do not shoot any wild pig, I turn to my ancestor, the pig, and it will send us wild pigs to be killed " (AUFENANCER 1970, 194-195) Apparently not all, people can adress the mythical owner of the wild pigs as is admittedly done in other planes. It might be however, that the ancestor-pig is nothing else than a totemic symbol, so that we should beware to overrate the importance of this statement. In several "Papuan" villages along the Sepik river, people possess hunting spi rits, such as Tamasua (in Maramba village), Vlisso (in Ai&gt;? tefugoa village) (cf LAUMANN 1951; 1952)(cf Annexe Illus tration AA)</page><page sequence="10">- 366 - The carvings representing these "benevolent spirits are not kept in the haus tamberana but in the owner*s house, where woman and children may see and touch them? Prayers are said to their spirits in order to have a succesful hunt, and, afterwards, offerings are given to them, which even tually are consumed by the villagers? There are, apparent ly, no other ceremonies or dances connected with these "hunting spirits" (Tamberan)? In the myths about Vlisso we learn that his mother Foribalema, could change herself into a pig, and that he was born of her while she was in that form? Vlisso, however, was a true man like his father Man galemoa was - and he became a tamberan only after his death? During his whole life he loved killing children and* people of other villages? In the end he was -spared : himself* His skull however, ."was preserved in the spirit house, and re** ceived sacrifical gifts? After a while, Vlisso again star ted harming people, till they appeased him with gifts? Before going hunting the villagers of Antefugoa used to fetch kumu - vegetables and eat them before Vlisso, while they prayed? "Look down:, we have only kumu to eat} we have not meat with it? Please, send us game in the forest?" After a succesful hunt they offered Vlisso the liver of each slain animal (LAUMANN 1952, 898-902)? According to the Kanbariber version of the myth, Blissoa (as he is called there) is invoked also when woman go fishing, or, in cases of sikhess, and particularly, on occasion of war when he must fight with his pjtfegees and avert the spears and ar rows of the -en^myo According to this story, no offerings are given to Blissoa, although a particular respect is paid to his bones (apparently some human, pig's and cassowary's bones), but they may not be seen by any woman or child (LAUMAM 1952, 904-907)* It would seem that several details of the Vlisso-story as, for example, his reputation of ha ving been a wild man whose relics are preserved, tend to view him as a human hunter from of old who was gradually taken up into the spirit worlds i&amp; other words, he finds his place in a form of ancestor cult and should not be re garded as a degraded supreme being (12)? This might not be true of similar spirits among other peoples? The personality of Wunekau, for instance, venerated</page><page sequence="11">- 36T in the region between Wewak and Aitape and on the Schouten Islands, is much more complex (He MEYER 1932/1934)* He, too, can send game or take it away and is invoked in time of war (1932, 824o839*844)* but over and above that his influence covers nearly all spheres of life? He assists travellers, fosters the growth of useful plants, protects against sickness aMdeath, and gives all kinds of magic? He has the sun as a torch in his hands (1932, 819) and seems to know everything (19339 30 n? 8). People even said that, what they called Wunekau, the missionaries called "God" (1932, 823)e It is not always clear whether Wunekau is one .person or two (of whom one at midday hands the sun over to his companion)? He is distinct from the ancestors, since in difficulties the latter are first invoked^ and when this avenue fails to be successful, then Wunekau11 s help is called upon (1932,854% He is however, not a su? preme being, and is related to a female masalai, called Telab, who existed before him and who has made mountains and rivers and fish etc. 1932,36)(13)* In this total configuration one would rather say that Wunekau, who others wise shares so many traits with Vlisso, may rather be a derivation of a higher being, which, as such, became too remote still to influence the daily lives of the people. What hunting is to the mainland, fishing is to the coastal and island folks2 both activities draw from nature without, as it ware, investing in it or without planning results at a distance. However, a pure fishing culture is hardly ever sufficient for survival, so that most of the time some hunting or planting is added to it. In view of the many hazards which influence a succesful catch, one will not be surprised to meet an abundance of fishing ma gic which has been described, for instance, for the coastal peoples of the Gazelle Peninsula (MEIER 1913) and for the irihabitants of the Trobriand and Goodenough Islands (14)* Such magic is often connected with a huge seasnake (MEIER 1908). One will notice, however, that in Melanesia there is no figure of a Pish Guardian proper, and that, as a rule it is the horticultural!sts* religion that has pres sed its stamp on the societies which also engage in fishing* Theorists ar divided as to the relation of a Lord of the Animals (Game Guardian, Owner of nature, etc.)to</page><page sequence="12">- 368 - the Supreme Being or High God of monotheistic religion? Our brief survey, limited to Melanenia, has shown that here, too, we do not meet a well defined personality, and that, for the time being, one might conclude with I? PAULSON that the two ideas of god - which are probably so very different in their scope and meening - are unaffected by each other (of HENNIGER 1968, 164-168). IIJo THE DEMA DEITIESo The concept of a culture hero is so wide that it also covers the higher beings venerated in horticulturists':cul tures9 which societies ai$ typologically so different from the wildbooters culturesd that iss from the food^gatherers* and hunters, considered in the previous section? The basic contrast lies, as was said earlier9 im the completely dif ferent attitude towards plants (and similary towards ani mals)? Men no longer destroy them for their consumption wherever their are met, but on the contrary they start put ting them to productive use by growing and cultivating plants (and by domesticating and breeding animals)o This form of culture requires a sedentary life, near gardens (and near the youg animals), and it imposes on man a grea ter reliance on sunshine and rain, and especially on the fertility of the ground? Apparently it was not sufficient for the early plan ters to conceive the new cultural goods as things "recei ved58 once and for all at the beginning of time, or, as it chanced, now and then? The fact is that they did develop a more vitalistic theory of their own? showing that "if the grain of wheat does die, it yields a rich harvest" (cf Jo 12,24)o In other wordss whereas for hunters killing was necessary but still an infringement of the rights of the game Guardian (who had to be asked permission and to be atoned with sacrifices), the same action now becomes the gate to a new life and the assurance of an abundant crop in due season* The basic concecpts in this worldview are not any more "to give, to bring" and "to receive", but they become the antinomy between "to die" and "to live", or more precisely,- as seen against the background of cutting up tubers to plant the various pieces the antinomy between "to kill" and "to grow and multiply" (15) Since such an understanding among the early horticul turalists contrasts widely with that found among the food</page><page sequence="13">- 369 - gatherers, there is sufficient reason for introducing a new concept. For this we turn to the religious world of the Marind-Anim of West Irian. These people are concerned with mythical beings who, by dying or being killed bring about the present world order, especially the foodcrops; they are called in their language "dema". The dema deities, in contrast to the previously mentioned culture heroes, have definite creative or transforming functions; they ap pear in human form, but sometimes also in the guise of ani mals or plants; but they are no longer present in the world except in the things into which they were transformed. The myth of the girl Hainuwele, the coconut dema, recorded on Ceram in the Moluccas is the most widely quoted example of this type, and deserves a full summary. (16) In mythical Times, a man named Ameta, out hunting, came on a wild boar. Trying to escape, the boar was drowned in a lake. On its tusk; Ameta found a coconut* That night he dreamed of the coconut and was commanded to plant it. which he did the next morning. In three days a coconut palm sprang up, and three days later it flowered. Ameta clim bed it to cut some flowers and make a drink from them. But he cut his finger and the blood dropped on the flower. Nine days later he found a girl child on the flower. Ameta took her and wrapped her in coconut fronds. In three days the girl be came a marriageable girl, and he named her Hainuwele ("coconut branch"). During the great Maro festival Hainuwele stood in the middle of the dancing place and for nine nights distributed gifts to the dancers. But on the ninth day the men dug a ^rave in the middle of the dancing place aiff threw Hainuwele into it during the dance. The grave was filled in and men danced on it. The next morning, seeing that Hainuwele did not come home, Ameta divined that she had been murdered. He found the body, disinterred it, and cut it into pieces, which he buried in various places, except the arms. The buried pieces gave birth to plants previously unknown, especially to tubers,which since then are the chief food of human beings.</page><page sequence="14">- 370 - Ameta took Hainuwele fs arms to another dema divinity, Satene. Satene drew a spiral with nine turns on a dancing ground and placed herself at the centre of it. Prom Hainuwele*s arms she made a door, and sum moned the dancers* "Since you have killed," she said, "I will no longer live here. I shall leave this very day* How you will have to come to me through ?this door0" Those who were able to pass through it remai ned human beings. The others were changed into aniibals (pigs, birds, fish) or spirits. Satene an nounced that after her going men would meet her only after their death, and she vanished from the surface of the Earth. (ELIADE 1963, 104-105)* According to this myth the desire of the dancers for the ever more valuable gifts of Hainuwele made them kill her? Although her violent death caused the -^withdrawal of the dema deities (to another world, associated with the moon)9 it also gave humanity the benefit of edible plants? According to one version of the myth (JENSEN" 1$)669 50) men could 'only die after they had eaten of the coconut, and only later could they marry as well? In this way death and procreation came to belong to the human way of life, just as they are parts of the vegetative world order&lt;* Still other versions of the myth give the origin of caracteristic customs of this cultural level; they are human sacrifice, ritual cannibalism, headhunting, sexual promiscuity and other rites which give expression to the themes of death and rebirth, e.g? at initiation ceremonies. In this way the dema myth is remembered through every human action that was brought into being by the events narrated in the story. Whenever man eats, he consumes the body of the slain dema; when he has sexual relations, kills, or dies, he is parti ciping in the human mode of life that was brought about by the primordial murder. It is not hard to see how this ideology fits the socio economic situation of early planters and brings unity to an otherwise unintelligible conglomeration of unrelated facts. Moreover, the idea of a ritual commemoration is found connatural to those who at Christmas recall the birth of their Saviour and who on Good Friday and Easter comme morate the mystery of his death and resurrection (cf JENSEN 1966, 143)*</page><page sequence="15">- 371 - The dema mythology described above is most illuminating for a great number of Melanesian root crop growers, even though not all of them fall within this category* (17) An interesting story to start with belongs to the Arapesh, a "Papuan" people who live in the Aitape-Sepik area (FORTUNE 1942, 217-219)* A woman, Sherok, is saved from a great flood by climbing a coconut tree, and starts afterwards putting all kinds of yams in her hollow fingers, toes, feet and hair? they appear on her body as boils, so that not one of the rain spirits is willing to welcome the ugly woman? Finally one younger brother keeps her for domestic services?she has to make soup of wood chips, which were at that time the yams of the village* "One day" the story continues? "The men (of the village) make a canoe and go on an expedition giving Sherok notice of their day of re turning* She sweeps the wood chips out of their hou ses and shakes down yams out of her hollow body in their place* As the men's canoe returns she prepares sago and yams soup, and set fire to the wood chips? She then decorates herself* The men see her with her boils gone and now the father wishes to marry her, a?d the elder brother wishes to marry her* She di rects their attention to the food* The father tells the elder son to try the soup and if he dies of ea ting it he will kill Sherok in revenge for him ? They all find it good? Sherok tells them that these are yams* What they had eating- were wood chips? When growing shoots appear on the yams Sherok instructs them to clear garden land? They ask how to do it? She shows them* They clear a small section of land for each man? Sherok charms stone axes and leaves them by the uncleared patches by night* In the morning they find that the stone axes have completed the clearing of the land by night finishing the high overgrowth or jungle*" (FORTUNE 1942, 217-218) The story continues, telling how Sherok, after having taught the people how to clear the land and to charm the tools to be used, shows them further how to cut small trees and to lop the branches of big trees, how to fell sago palms and to pound their pith, how to hunt game with</page><page sequence="16">- 372 - dogs (the first domesticated animal! )f how to dry vegeta tion, make garden fences, plant yams and broadcast seeds, how to weed around the yams, dig them out and carry them home in stringbags . All the time the charmed instruments work by themselves, without demanding any hard work. The end of the story is thus* "Sherok did not warn her husband that, when he took food to the garden for the stone axes who were at work there, he was not to talk to them, but was to put the food down simply and come away. As he .ap proached the axes who were lopping branches off a ficus tree he said "slowly, slowly". They slipped down on him and killed him. They ate the sago and returned to the village. Sherok found his corpse in the garden and buried him". (FORTUNE 1942, 219). There are other versions of this myth, which also show that they belong to the realm of culture heroes (treac ted above) now adapted to an agricultural setting. The death motif is present, but now applied to the husband of Sherok, and not to the Yam woman herself. Again the woman's death could have been just an accident, while another ver** sion from the same area (cf GERSTNER 1939, 260-264) notes that the self-working axes not merely fell out of the ficus tree, but threw themselves upon the man and devoured him completely - which seems to refer to a cannibalistic feast such as would be fitting for a dema myth, if only the people would have feasted on the body of Sherok herself 08). The next step towards a pure dema mythology are the stories in which a mythical woman immolates herself. This is reported by the Bo la people, living in West New Britain, Talasea area,(KROLL 1938, 378). Formerly people lived upon makundukatot a kind of black stuff the children gathered on the beach. Then Runepai came, and after having asked for firewood, made a fire, put stones upon it, stretched herself upon the fire, and the children covered her with stones and leaves; then they went off to play? Runepai tur ned herself alternately right and left, and in time she was transformed into bananas, tares, yams, sugarcane and other vegetables, in great profusion* Nothing was left of the wo man herself. The children ate and rejoiced. Later on peo ple started planting slips of the new vegetables.</page><page sequence="17">- 373 - A similar tale is found on the Western Solomon Islands, Mono, Alu and Pauru (WHEELER 1926, 205)* In this case the old woman used to cup up her body, boil her own flesh, and served it as pig's meat* Her children became suspicious because this never happened when they stayed home, and so they spied upon the old woman? When the secret was disco vered they were disgusted, and the daughter killed her mo ther? Here^we see how a dema murder ends the story while the beginning of the tale resembles the culture hero type? Different again is a version from Buin on Bougainville a bout the two brothers who killed and cremated their mother and then buried the bones? Next day the first coconut tree sprouts forth? After a while they try to eat the leaves or the fronds or the very young nuts, till finally, they discover the value of the maturing and fully ripe nuts, and start to appreciate the gift of tteir mother (THTJRNWALD 1912, 399)* This story is also interesting for the role played in it by a dog and a pig, perhaps because their domestication coincided with the cultivation of the first fruit trees (1912, 402)? The specific origin of these animals is not explained though, and the myth is no doubt mutilated close to its beginning, so that further information about the generous mother is not avaible? Slightly different again - because no foodstuffs are involved - is the Kai myth about the woman of Laugube who discovered by chance the fir6t bull-roarert revealed the secret to her brother, and then asked him to kill her so that only the men should know about this cultic instrument? Related versions are found among the Bukaua, the Tami, and on Hew Ireland, where the woman is killed by the men. Still other versions, e?g? from Bougainville and the Banks Is lands, while omitting the woman1s self-immolation, refer the story to respectively upi-hats and to some other sa cred instruments? In alle these cases a culture hero tale has been adopted into the dema mythology and is used to explain the origin of cult and ritual? (19) Altough the examples given so far refer to female spiritual beings, it has been noted that, in Melanesia, the culture of horticulturalists is dominated rather by male beings (HATT 1951? 398)? We shall refer immediately to instances of this type, starting off once more with</page><page sequence="18">- 374 - myths of the culture hero type. In the Buin area one sto ry speaks about the man Tantanu, who relieves himself and so gives people taros and yams (THURNWALD 1912, 394-395)* (20; The equally Melanesian Ulau and Suein tribes (near Aitape) have a tale about a male sago spirit, Tenal-Pisin (who in some places figures as two brothers). He is the sago himself, and white as washed sago? He is associated with the white moon, and connected with the introduction of other foodplants, such as bananas, tuberous plants, breadfruit trees etc. On time, when he attended a sing sing in the place Arop, a heavy rain stopped him from get ting away in time and his body completely dissolved? That is why Arop is particulary rich in sago groves ( MEYER H. 1932, 439-441)* In this case the culture gifts occur, as it were, accidentally. Self-immolation of the hero is attested on Pentecost Island (Mew Hebrides), where an old man, Lingrus, disco vered that the parings of his toes and fingers grew into delicious crops* He then asked some children to cut him to pieces and bury the different parts of his body. In the end his legs produced long and straight yams, the heart round yams, the bowels crocked yams etc? Up to today the rituals connected with the cultivation of yams remain the property of one particular clan of the Imir tribe (TAT TEVIN 1928, 450-451)* Melanesian fisherman cultures absorb bed the dema ideology in different ways. The Tami (Huon Gulf, New Guinea), for instance, know about a man who had always exceptional luck in. fishing, so that at the end, one of his wives became suspicious and had her little boy sPy upon the fathero So it became known that, while on the sea, the man took off his headband, and held his dirty head in the water. Pish came from all sides and suched upon his hair, and were afterwards collected into the boat. Knowing the secret, the woman became disgusted and angry, and scolded the man* The fisherman then withdrew in si lence to the village place, and instructed his eldest son to watcli the spot where he went. Next morning the man was not to be seen any more? After some time the first coco nut palm sprouted forth at the place the man had disappea red* (BAMLER 1911, 546-547)* Similar self-immolat^n are rather common, e?g? in a story from the North-east</page><page sequence="19">- 375 - coast of Bapua, where an unnamed man took off his headt before attracting the fish, to his boat,and when the dis gusted villagers had flung his head.into the bush, it be came the first coconut palm (KER 1910, 92-96)0 There is also a Manus story-of two brothers who were chased in their canoe by a shark, till one of them offered to feed the fish with his own body, having only his head left at the endj this again produced the first coconut (MEIER 1907, 660-663) According to the Papuan story, just referred to, the lucky fisherman turned himself into a hugh fish (KER 1910, .96), but there are also numerous Melanesian tales were a gigantic eel or sea snake is beheaded, followed by the metamorphosis of its head into a coconut (MEIER 1907, 65O 658)* As is known, snakes as opposed to eels and fish are usually thought of as male creatures*(RITTER,1945* 11-13)? In Melanesia they are among the most commun cul ture bringers in the matter of food, agriculture, fire pots and flutes etc*, and have even ( as on Manus Islands the Gazelle Peninsula, Rossel Island and San Christobal) a creative function regarding sun and moon, islands and sea, mountains and rivers, etc* (21) At several points, the typical dema model might be further abandoned by including non-edible goods, or even social or behavioural patterns (WILLIAMS 1928, 7), and such material things as different types of houses (WHEE LER 1926, 14? LAKDTMAB* 1917* 116 C). One might also find reference to other biological functions, as has alreadybeen mentioned (cf also LAUBSCHER 1976)* It is noteworthy that in some places, the sexual act is essential in the deve lopment of vegetable food? This view is apparently con fined to the Southern Hew Guinea, in the adjacent Islands to the North of Torres Strait and among the Kawai and larind-Amin Peoples, where these myths are the basis of some rather crude rituals? One example of such a mytk is the Kiwai story about the crops produced by the culture hero Sido sowing his own semen (LANDSMAN 1927* 114-115)* At the same time on can find more conventional stories,as e*g* the story in which the culture hero Soido killed his outraged wife, cut up her body and threw the pieces on the newly cleared garden? All the red food such as taros and</page><page sequence="20">- 376 - yams sprang from the woman*s blood, and all the white food such as sweet potatoes (22) and bananas from her flesh and bones (LANDTMAN 1927 , 119) One cannot help seeing some mimilarities between the Melanesian dema model and some features of classical poly theismo For one thing, the names of the deities are so ma nifold that even in one and the same society there may ap pear different individuals for each particular cultural i tern. (23) Again, the very theme of a "dying deity" is fa miliar from Efyptia$L, Semitic, and Greek mythology, even though there are marked differences. (24) For instance, the gods Marduk and Dionysos regulary come back to life and are rather "dying and resurrecting deities", while such a resur rection, although found (cf LAKDTMAN 191-79 121 and 265), is not common in Melanesia? Moreover, the classical deities ap pear widely with the same names or, at least with the same characteristics,while a great variety of names is typical for Melanesia (SCHMITZ 1960, 229 n?43)* There are also de finite signs of a unifying tendency in the dema myths, which we shall review shortly? IV . SKY GODS AMD SUPREME BEINGS Several Melanesian societies do not belong to the early horticulturalists, commonly associated with a religioi built around dema deities? Although they are not classified with the advanced agriculturalists (who grow corn or rice, have mastered the technique of building granaries, and oc cupy themselves with the additional breeding of large cattle) they have definitely produced a. Melanisian brand of advan ced agriculture? In fact, irrigation and drainage were so largely known in the Wahgi Valley, from 7000 B.C. onwards (GOLSON 1977) 9 that one must assume a well organized and centralized society, able to carry out these labour inten sive methods? In addition, there is evidence that by this date pigs too were kept, and no doubt played - as still hap pens nowadays - an important role in the people*s ceremonial life? However, substantial numbers of pigs were not arrived at until ca? 3000/4000 B?C? (BULMER 1975, 1&amp;-19. 36)? There is, in other words, no doubt that besides wildbooters and early horticulturalists more advanced farmers have also long formed part of the tradional Melanesian ?e?ne,and that a</page><page sequence="21">- 377 - query about their own religion is not to be dismissed* As far as the evidence goes, we do not find so called Promotheus myths, according to which man obtained useful plants from heaven via a cunning theft, as the story often goes among corn and rice growers (JENSEN 19 66, 17-25)* Neither do we encounter a typical Sky-god such as ia found among the pastoralists of the Ancient Near East or among Aborigines of Australia, i.e. among groups which wander around easily but are always confronted with a celestial power concerned with the weather and the atmos|&gt;her9,~ and with the creative process in general (JAMES 1963f 1-21 ) However, the latter are not absent altogether* Reviewing again the previously given data, we can recall sky beings as Wunekau who "carried the sun" or Vlis so who lived "on high"* Some clearer examples of such sky gods are found on the Tami islands (Huon Gulf) and among the Kewa people ( Eastern Highlands of New Guinea)* In the first society it is generally believed that Anuto or Anutu is the creator of the world, which includes heaven and earth and man's first parents, although it is sometimes said that he created the different peoples and their res pective territories* Nothing is. known about his origin or about his present whereabouts} maybe he lives on a nice island or he is resting in the netherworld, but anyhow his abode is not with other spirits (buwun) or with those who have died* He has not left any distinctive marks behind, and there is no special place reserved for his worship* At festive gatherings he gets the first portion of the food - "That is Anuto's part" -and this food is taken somewhere into the bush* Anuto is believed to eat the essence of the food, after which the messenger may eat what is considered to be the outward appearance of the food offering* The name of Anutu is also used in magic spells* In general, he is not to be feared but is a benevolent being* His pre sence is felt at earthquakes, when it is believed that he changes position near the underworld rock against which he is leaning (BAMLER 1911,491)* Similar concepts exist on Siassi Island regarding Anutuat, and linguists are of the opinion that both names are related to the Polynesian word ^for "god" (atua), which has other meanings as well, and</page><page sequence="22">- 378 - basically only refers to one or other of the mai?y spirits, which are not necessarilly masculine, nor good or powerful (GAPELL 1969,155)* Variations of Anuto*s name appear also on the South Coast of Hew Britain, with He Hat among the Mengen, E Hut among the Sulka, a id A Hutu among the Arawe, etc? According to the beliefs of the Mengen there are two brothers, the good one, Hutu sina (the Staall Hut) and the stupid one3 Hutu evolau (the Big Hiit)? The good Hat crea ted the earth, the clouds, the bush and the first parents} the latter were broiight forth through his creative thin king (lo mantana) or his wilful thinking (koengapa)? (25) Because men followed the advice of the bad Hut, they have to suffer pain, to work hard, and finally they will die? .Among the "Papuan" Kol there is one creative deity, Ragira, who is believed to be the mother of Hutu (JAHSSEH 1975^ 22-24* 28-29)o Such variations around one similar name should warn us that it is not etymology but mythology that is decisive in determing the nature of a given spirit being? Another example is the invisible sky god of the Kewa people; his name is Yakaii in Talibu, Yeki in Mendi, and Yekili in Eagua, and this term is the normal Kewa word for "(good) luck"? It is belie Ted that once upon a time Yakili did appear on earth to give his "Great Speech"? According to the Yalibu version, the story goes as followss There were four men living in the Yalibu Basin? Each one lived his own life withouth knowing the other? Each one thought he was the only man li ving in his own area with a few tamed pigs and dogSo But Yakili created all these men and put them in separate places? One day Yakili intended to give a speech and invited each one of them? When Yakili appeared in the presence of these men, he was half man and half vegetation? He gave his great speech by sayings "Pipnua^ Yaguranua"a meanings "Lose your skin, live forever"? He concluded his speech with the explanation of his appearance? Unfortunately one o^ the men who lived on the eastern side of the Y alibu Basin did not make it on time? He arrived when the creator was to depart? The latecomer questioned Yakili sayings "Akelaepa", meaning "What'.have you said?"</page><page sequence="23">- 379 - Yakili turned around and said: "Komanua , Raluanua1' t meaning : "Death, Increase". He added two more wordst "Epeanaafl Koeyanu".meaning * "Good,Evil". After that Yakili disappreared into the sky above, never to be seen again. (AFEA 1977* 25-26). As to the explanation, people say that Yakili is the god of all the Kewa speakers and is unique in his kind, with no other gods beside him? anyhow - if there were others - these other gods were of no practical importance to them. Yakili?s hybrid appearance did manifest that he had a special relationship to the humans whom he created (sic), and who, moreover could turn to him in their needs with prayers, sacrifices and worship. It also indicated that Yakili had power (puri) over the whole of creation, being the contro1ler and lifegiver of all that exists. In fact the whole land belongs to him. It is further ex plained that, because the first man took part in (-divided, hence, diminished?) the work of creation, there exists now good and evil, and that the eastern Kewa in particu lar are responsable for man's loss of everlasting life. Since disobedience had such a devastating consequence, men are hence-forth expected to live a (morally) good life. Understood in this traditional way, the six words of Ya kili explain why man is faced with death and evils if all men had obeyed, people would still live on, having only to shed their skins, as snakes do. Then too Yakili would have reappeared to renew regularly his Great Speech. Now instead he has withdrawn to the sky, form where he still provides man with the necessary things? rain, sunshine, abundant food, male offsprings etc. (APEA 1977* 26-30). One might note that regarding Yakilifs unicity one should not be too affirmative, since other fieldworkers have got different impressions and state that "at least ten major spirits... make up the bulk of the Kewa super natural order" (PRANKLIN/PRAUKLIN 1978, 464), while it is agreed that in day to day life the ancestral spirits (remo)receive the greater amount of attention. Again, as far as the record goes, there is in the origin myth no hint of other peoples, different from the four Kewa groups, so that Yakili^ transcendence is probably limited to this</page><page sequence="24">- 380 - one tribe and their ancestral land, and does not extend to mankind and the universe, as a reading out of context might suggest* As to Yakili s creation and providence, one should he wary of reading into these loaded terms the scho lastic doctrine of a creatio ex nihilo sui et subjecti and the understanding of providence as a continued creation* One should therefore better speak about ^-making" and "trans forming"- just as it is more to the point to have culture heroes "bringing" their various cultural goods* Finally, concerning the moral life, it should be remembered that other Kewa myths connect some ethical rules, such as not quarreling or not fighting in the families, with the in structions of the reincarnated first mother, who after her husband9s disobedience likewise left the place to stay mow im the spirit world (APEA 1977^31)o It seems therefore that some mutual influence between the concepts of creator/ lawgiver and of ancestor cannot altogether be excluded* Yet, notwithstanding these critical remarks, one must say that Yakili has typical features of a so called high God, ranging from his creative functions to his impact on raarJs life* Wheras the two previously mentioned societifl?positi vely about the creator and are apparently not interested in any end of the world, one has to consider also the case of peoples who preserve rather negative elements in their belief of a sky god* (26) This is the case among the Kai people, near neighbours of the Tami Islanders* It is admit ted her* that Malengfung created the world with its pri mordial inhabitants (nemu)fl but that - after having made man - he withdrew from him and left everything to itself, without any kind of interference* Malengfung now just sleeps at the end of the earth, at the edge of the red (light) of dawn* People realise that he is still there when in his sleep he turns over and produces earthquakes* Of him people have a saying which recalls some words of the Psalmist (Ps 104,29)? when Malengfung turns his back to us, we die, but when he kindly turns his face to us, we live and are well off"* The appearance of this creator is hybrid, with a human face in front, and at the back resem bling a huge rock, covered with moss and vines* According to some people Malengfung will one day rise and break the</page><page sequence="25">- 381 - sky to pieces; the pieces will fall upon the earth and bring an end to all living beings? According to another version Malengfung created a giant, the old Panggu, who has a simi lar appearance and analogous functions to his? He would be the one who is carrying the sky on his head, and he may not move lest the sky tumbles down (KEYSSER 1911, 155) (2?)? A variation of these myths are found among the Bukaua (Huon Gulf), where eclipses of the sun or moon are interpreted as the sickness or death of these mighty beings? Here people used to say at the sudden darkening of the moon? *"*Fhe moon is dead? now the sky will fall down, and we will all die" (LEHHER 1930/31, 111-112)o It is nbteworthy - unlike in the Bible - that no speculation is found why such world cata strophies would ever occur, whereas lesser evils are often attributed to moral causes? Whatever theological limita tions one might find in the respective myths, they still show the belief in a higher being who is not part of this world? It does not seem likely that the sky god model is very frequent, or that origin questions are asked in any system matic way? But this does not allow us to conclude that therefore Melanesians are mentally dumb, pre-logical, or unable to reach beyond the boundaries of their own tribe? It does not prove either that loftier concepts of a so cal led primitive revelation have degenerated in the course 6f time? Such theories are mere suppositions without proof, while a sufficient explanation is provided in the fact that the Jf^cific Islanders are more concerned with their concrete environment than with a far distant sky or heaven? They dwell therefore usually on the models of culture heroes and dema deities, and have only limited interest in problems of origin? In the cases of Anuto or Yakili or of the Yam Wo man Sherok no further questions are asked while there is some further search for Hainuwele*s father, Ameta, and for Wunekau1s mother, Telab? On the Gazelle Peninsula, where the Gunantuna people derive nearly everything from the two brothers To Kabinana and To Purgo, we find also an "old mother", the :i dentification of whom with the great snake spirit (kaia) is never made clear? (28) One reason for the vagueness of much information is that present day Melane sians generally use the Pidgin term masalait which lacks a</page><page sequence="26">- 382 - great deal of precision. The term is borrowed from the language of Hew Hanover, where it means a water spout or a large snake (29){in Pidgin English it has now beoome a collective name for all superhuman beings, even ogres and bogeys, and it might in some places even include the tamberah or spirits of the dead. (30) One needs therefore to assess the whole mythology of a people, a requirement which it is often impossible to perform because the rele vant material has not been collected, or - as in the case of the Tami - still awaits publication. The relatively few cases in which a higher being pre cedes either culture heroes or dema deities clearly mani fest a tendency towards unification of thought, which has left other traces as well* The central deed, often a kil ling or some other physical action, is another example of this unifying tendency, cutting across the innumerable na mes given to the same beings. Again, the agricultural mo tive of "cutting - planting - growing" as applied beyond the original realm of edible foods to include also useful items of the material world and even elements of the peo pled moral and religious life (e.g. marriage rules, tri bal laws, sacred flutes, other rituals) is another case in point. It is superfluous to add that many different soci eties share this outlook, which again indicates a unity of approach in religious matters. We should probably not rate too highly the requirement for unicity of the primal being(s) and recall for example that Christianity too struggles * with a doctrine of one God in tree Persons, and with a teaching about God's creation in the beginning besides a belief in Christ^h^ough whom all things came to be" (Jo 1, 3)i There are indeed cases on record where newly converted Christians have expressed the affinities between their tra ditional concepts and the new Christian theology.(31) Such statements are most interesting, in the present context, because they reveal the local concepts which are the hi ghest achievements of the people concerned, and which there fore should be taken in the sense given to them. The greatest difference betwv^n Melanesian religions and the biblical message concerns probably the practical importance of a first gre&amp;t spirit. There is no doubt</page><page sequence="27">- 383 - about the intellectually satisfying^role which such beings perform in the traditional world view by explaining the presence of man and of his social and physical environment. Like culture heroes, they often left traces of their acti vities in the immediate surroundings (32) or are even be lieved to dwell somewhere on the tribal land (33)? They have received titles and names which sometimes reveal an admirable moral trust and &lt;$smtaitmefrt(34) ? Beside these ap pelatives, we find also short ^icyers and invocations, es pecially in extreme need (BROWN 1910, 199f LAUFER 1946/49, 512)1 or even sacrifices in the peoplets homes, on mountain tops, in gardens etc. (APEA 1977* 29), but in many instances apparently no prayers are said, and no ritual is observed, as for example among the Ngaing ( LAWRENCE 1965, 204), on central New Ireland (PEEKEL 1910, 6) etc. This type of a distant deity, who is not any more relevant to man's daily concerns, is then called "otiose" and "no intervening" in opposition to the so dynamic and fully concerned God of the Bible. Although the use of impulsive invocations in extreme need, which people do not really expect to be heard (VAN" DER,LEEDW 1931,93)? is not sufficient to credit a higher * being with a cult on a par with the regular rites of other religions, one should not lose sight of other elements in the traditional forms of worship. One of these elements is the impressive dramatic representations of the dema, which must be repeated, maybe after long intervals, to as sure a continued fertility of plants and animals and men&lt;&gt; Again, in the more private sphere, there are for example the recitation of"myths which favourably influence the growth of crops, or the use of magic which is performed following the example or the instructions of some primal being? What is cult, and what is regularity in its perford inance must be assessed on the local scene, and not determi ned out of context or in advance (SCHMITZ 1964, 553-557) If some societies have given very unsatisfactory answers up to now, one can often question the value of the ethnogra phic material collected, which is an almost proverbial com plaint for many Melanesian societies. Before concluding, we should try to appreciate the</page><page sequence="28">- 384 - positive content of the divine otiosity* The great work of the primal being is, from the human point of view, to have established the present universe and, then, to have with drawn and to refrain from any further involvement in human affairs? Some authors think that such an obliteration of a first being can only be the result of an increased attest tion to other spirits which really fall into the second ra$k G But - from a traditionalist point of view - the ma ligned otiosity might well be am essential attribute of the first being in so far as it is creator and has put the world into existence* Once the world is there, the creation is virtually completed, and any further intervention would not only be superfluous* "but is also felt to endanger the present order, which consequently might lapse again in chaos? Hence the creator, by not acting any more assures the most favou rable and connatural condition for things to remain as they ares thus he assures continuity and stability, and can right ly be seen as a provident god (PETTAZONI 1951,75)(35)* With this opinion we have, of course, left the world of at tested facts and ended up with a theological appreciation, which will not be shared by everyone* V* TAMBERAN AND MASALAI One should not make the mistake of so concentrating on the higher or highest being that it is presented in a gr^eatter isolation than the one in which it actually is be lieved to be&lt;&gt; We noted this already when commenting upon the figure of Yakilio In fact, the very concept of supreme being implies that there is no direct and regular contact* Yet there are other means of transcending the world of the senses* They are beliefs and practices which show a res pectful attitude towards some parts of nature9 and also ma nifest a filial reliance on those who in past times have succesfully met the needs of every day* This, then, is the place where the veneration of spirits and ancestors enters into the picture* They are considered here only in as far they bridge a gap between the distant deity and man0 When people used to go after their food, and on occasion left behind those who had died (or bur:"ed them at sea), there was little or no link with the pie ceding generation* This changed however, with the acceptance of a semi - or</page><page sequence="29">?h 385 ** fully sedentary life, which is generally believed to,pro vide the setting for ancestor veneration (36). Basically, we encounter here a respect for tradition and for the status quo&gt; which was already operative in credi ting the higher being with its otiosity, while in the so ciety at large, the same concept manifests itself in a de ferential attitude towards the elders? Their word is law, approval a blessing, their frown a curse? And since the belief in immortality is also present (whatever theory is advanced to explain its origin), it is only natural to as sume that, from beyond the grave, the deceased elders keep watching their blood relations on earth? In turn, the sur viving generation would keep looking at them for continued protection and guidance? Turning now to some concrete societies, we might first mention the Kewa people who - as said earlier - are not aware of any other deity comparable to Yakili, but who venerate the ghosts (37) of both their first parents and of the recently deceased (APEA 1977* 31-36) and these have free access t'o&gt;the domain of the supernatural spirits (PRAN KLIN/PRAKKLIN 1978, 464). One myth of origin (APEA 31) shows how the ancestralveneration came about, and reveals that the spirits of the ancestors live invisibly among the people and also inhabit their own world and have their own language? They contact the humans in visions and dreams, or communicate with them via people who are believed to be possessed (The so called yanego ali or "channels of commu nication"), and by means of animals such as snakes, casso waries, rats and birds? (38) Appreciation for the spirits1 care is expressed in gift offerings and prayers, in times of need and in ordinary times, but such actions are collec tively performed for the distant ancestors and more priva tely for the recently deceased relatives? Simon APEA sum marizes his description by saying that there are no signs of any deification, but that the relationship "is something like good Christians having friends in heaven, known as saints, and celebrating their feast days"; such an attitude is well deserved "because they (i.e? the spirits of the dead) were always near and much closer to the people than the creator Yakili" or - for that matter - even the Chris tian God (APEA 35-36) ? Another type of relationship is</page><page sequence="30">~ 386 ~ found in the Manus society which is well known for its concern with their many "Sir Ghosts", who even share the houses with the mortals? The description available do show that the relationship are very pragmatic? Sir Ghost and his ward are near relatives? the living pay him due respect and devotion, service and sacrifice, and they ex pect him to return good health, luck in fishing? If no re sult is visible, it might happen that the skull of a for mer faithless Sir Ghost is thrown into the sea or ground to pieces and burnt by the children, without fear of any consequences whatsoever (FORTUNE 1935* 12-29)? Whereas among the Melanesian Manus people the recent dead appear more powerful than those whose memory has al ready faded away, there are also instances in which the dead fall into a miserable and almost shadow - existance - as is the case among the Israelites with their concept of sheol ? An example of the same is found among the people living near the Mimika-river (West Irian), where at a dead feast a ghost is adressed in such terms as the following? "Elder brother, during your lifetime you caught a lot of fish for us?, but nevertheless I am not in want now? I know all the tricks myself? Every day I eat sago with fish (which is in fact not always the case)? You are dead, but we have still plenty of sago and fish?" In other words, these people greatly appreciate the profi ciencies of those who died, but they are not indispensable? There is no need for them to remain with the living since the latter can manage without them? With such rituals and their blend of farce, showing off, fear and reverence, the recently deceased individuals of some importance are sent off to the abode of the ghosts, far away in the mountains (POUWER 1956, 375-382)? In the same society we meet two culture heroes to whom the origin of this masquerade is ascribed, but it is not clear whether these spiritual beings fare any better in the appreciation of the Mimika? (39) Not only ancestral spirits might invisibly influence the daily life, but also those spirits who live on the tribal land in pools, rocks, mountains, rivers, precipices etc?? As a case in point we look at the Huli of the New Guinea Highlands? Although they believe in the persistence</page><page sequence="31">- 387 - of human souls after death, and attribute to them an influ ence which is growing with their antiquity (GLASSE 1965,32), their religious life is for the greatest part concerned with the dama ? These are extremely powerful beings rela ted to the course of nature who often intervene in the af fairs of men? They attack humans, sometimes capriciously causing sickness, infertility or death? At times they pu nish certain offenses, or cause suffering at the bidding of the sorcerers? Several dama have small hutlike temples, while offerings and promises are made to appease them? Ma ny of these deities are clearly identified, such as the sun, Hi and his sister the moon, Hana; others are embodied in various material objects, generally a stone artifact, an oddly shaped natural stone, or a fossil? When not in use for rituals, the stone objects are buried, and the presence of the stones instils the surrounding country with the for ce of the deity? People who enter these areas must there fore behave with caution? Some lesser deities inhabit on ly one locality, and are seldom connected with particular objects or hutlike shrines? Also a few of the greater dei ties have normally no local or object associations? Besides the said dama beings, there is a host of unnamed nature de mons (dama dagenda)inhabiting the forest ranges. They at tack travellers, causing bruises, sores and bleeding noses? Unlike other deities, these nature demons have no sacrifi ces or rituals associated with them whose enactment might placate them. The Huli do not believe in a hierarchy a mong the dama, yet they admit that the greater deities can exert some influence on the lesser, particularly in res training them from attacking humans? Finally, not belon ging to the category of these dama, there is the omnipre sent Datagaliwabe, a unique spirit-being whose sole con - cern is to punish breaches of kinship rules? There is no way of placating him: no rituals are performed for him and no*prayers entreat his goodwill (GLASSE 1965* 27-37)- (40) The particlar religious configuration around so many localized spirits has some analogy with the dema religion of the Marind-Anim,discussed earlier, but we are unable to affirm any historical connections between the two? Part of the problem is no doubt the different interests of the anthropologists who studied the two societies,and also the</page><page sequence="32">~ 388 ~ lack of recorded myths among the Huli people. As the two systems of religion present themselves, the differences are quite obvious, e?g? between the rather unified view of the Marind-Amin on the one hand, and the more stratified religious world of the Huli on the other. As said earlier, the belief in spirits (masalai) and ghosts (tamberan) often serves to bridge the gap between man arid a distant deity. Yet quite apart from obvious m*** oeptions, as on Manus,(41) we cannot say that a clear pic ture has emerged. In fact, sometimes fear seems to domi nate, whereas in other cases stress is laid on the benevo lence of the nearby supers-human beings? In general, how ever, ambiguity prevails, and missionary literature has usually stressed this negative effect, quoting at length the testimonies of newly coverted Melanesians (cf e?g? PILHOFER 1968,18-19). One should however, not neglect al together the other side of the picture. A masalai might be able to cause the very worst disasters, but he also pro tects the owner of the place he lives in? (42) Again, he might not harm others, provided they "keep the rules", and avoid certain places or times? One has then merely to take the necessary precautions, in the same manner as one does, for instance, to protect himself against traffic accidents (POUWER 1956 , 385). VI? THE CHRISTIAN GOD Since the 1870?s the Christian church has gained a foothold in the South Pacific Islands, and in many places different churches have been present for nearly one hundred of years? It is estimated, at the present time, that a bout 9? percent of the population has some kind of affili ation with one or the other of these groups? We might therefore rightly ask how the message of the Christian God has been assimilated into the Melanesian mind? The long and slow nature of the process of christianization would explain why there are many local varieties, a fact which cannotK&gt;verlooked even in traditionally Christian countries? It is not our aim to review today9s understan ding of God in Melanesia, but just to dwell on a few ques tions, such as the name early missionaries adopted for their Christian God, and how they treated the local deitieso</page><page sequence="33">- 389 - Here as alsewhere, foreign missionaries have often "been forced to enter the field of ethnology because of the needs of their ministry* They wished Christianity to be better received and more easily assimilated, so that the new converts would really feel at home (BOISMEMJ 1940,3) One of the first problems to face was how to name God, and which principles should be adopted in finding cultural equivalents for angels and demons and saints. One can say that the answer depended very much upon the theological frame within which the solution was sought* Some people wanted to stress the continuity between the traditional heritage and the Christian message, while others would emphasize the element of discontinuity, newness and conver sion. Both parties could, naturally, quote some passages from the Bible to support their stand. In an earlier section we referred to some South Bou gainville dema myths regarding Tantanu. One recently pu blished version ends as follows: When the missionaries came to Siwai, they chose Tantanu as the word to mean the Christian God. Today the Siwai people still call the Almighty God and Creator, by the name of Tantanu (KIHEA 1972,26) Similar examples of borrowing, which all stress the the continuity with the past are found among the Lutheran Church near Pinschhaven where the Christian God is called Anutu, or among the Capuchin Mission near Mendi which a? dopted the name Yakili, or in a recent translation by the Summer Institute of Linguistics, which introduced the Bai ning word Ngemumaka (cf Mk 1,1.14?*? e). The validity of this choice depends on the whole underlying mythology, where the translator must find at least the central core of biblical truth (MBA 1947, 206). Therefore, the first de cision taken is of the greatest importance, and it is of ten not possible any more to check the basis on which an old choice has been made* In the course of time the mea nings of words change, and they are not identical in the various areas of the same language; this poses special pro blems with a church language or lingua franca which spreads outside the place of its origin. With these reservations in mind, some criticisms might be expressed.</page><page sequence="34">- 390 - As to the name Anutu, it should he recalled that va riations of the name are widespread indeed, while the ac companying understanding is not everywhere the same? As a consequence, this Kate term might be an acceptable trans lation in the cradle of the Lutheran Mission near Finsch hafen, but it is unlikely that it is valid for the whole cultural region, where one finds, for example, a Big Kit competing with a Small Nut, and these two culture heroes seem not to qualify for the biblical concept of one supre me creator god* Again, in connection with the Kewa people and the Christian Yakili, we must note that some Christi ans are unhappy about the choice, even if it is only be cause the Christian God - unlike the traditional Yakili - has not left traces in their ancestral land or in the memo ries of the ages pasts he did not speak to the Kewa ances tors as he did to Abraham, but instead appears as a God dwelling afar off (.APEA 1?77, 47*48)* Finally, some Bai nings note that Ngemumaka or Gumumacha (which means "my maker~he" or " my father") is not an original being, but rather a male ancestor who has a female companion, Gumu? maichi,("my~makea&gt;-she" or "my Mother",) and both of them owe their existence to Kamerem or Kamurem, i0e* "He~made both" (HESSE 1972, B-II-1 of JANSSEN 1975* 2?)* Because of this reason the Catholic Mission in the same area finds it unacceptable so to designate the God of the Bible, and it prefers to keep using Deo, its own traditional rendering* Such an attitude is not based upon a general prejudice, be cause the same Church also uses vernacular terms, provided they do pose fewer theological problems than would be the case in regard to the designation of God* Discontinuity with the past is most obvious when Eurc?&gt; pean loam words were adopted, e*g* when the early Catholic priests near Rabaul translated "Let us pray to God" with "Bat a prier Deo" (BLEY 1932*97)? In this context the use of the Latin Deo is typical for the Catholics, while the Anglicans and Presbyterians borrowed "God" from the English, and" the Methodists in Hew Britain and New Ireland introdu ces the Fijian term Kalou* (43) All these groups obviously believed that only a foreign term could convey the new mea ning contained in the missionary teaching* They all defied the pedagogical warning " ignotum per ignotius", an belie</page><page sequence="35">- 391 - ved that patient explanation could achieve what otherwise appeared to be impossible. However, one should not assume too easely that the set aim has also been arrived at. The danger is that, before any explanation, the unknown is understood in terms of the known, that is, that the foreign god has been equated with one of the deities or culture he roes of the native religion, and has so been integrated into the local system. Instead of being able to fill an empty word with the proper meaning, the translator has a name which has already been given a content taken from the pagan religion (NEDA 1947*205). (44) There is no doubt however, that an uncontaminated foreign word can receive the proper meaning, because a language,as a living thing, regularly assimilates new words. As matter of fact, Deo, God, and Kalou are undisputed examples of a "baptism" that has taken place, and these imported terms now express what a local term could not convey? The classical way of handling the problem of naming god consists in either using a generic native word? or al so a local expression to describe the right idea. This was done for ages, when Christians rejected names like Zeus, Jupiter and Woden, but were agreable to the use of theos, deus , and guda ? All the proper names listed were dis carded because they included a great deal of legend as to the individual peculiarities,excesses and immoral behaviour of the particular gods. But the native generic names get through, although they too had their limitations and short comings (NIDA 1947,206). The Germanic guda9 for example, was a neuter form, meaning probably "what is called upon", and could refer to both male and female divinities? yet it was wide enough to be filled with a new meaning. The same happened with the Fijian term kalou, which did" not require the personal article ko in front of it, but was used with the common article a and naj it first of all indicated the soul of a dead person, i.e. ghost, but it included nature spirits as well* A kalou vatu or "stone spirit" was a stone inhabited by such a spirit and carried into war to assure victory. Although this origin suggests a very unsa tisfactory name for the Christian God, it was nevertheless adopted and duly "baptized" (CAPELL 1969,154)* A similar choice was made in Hotuan. Early missionaries found no</page><page sequence="36">- 392 - comnrom name for spirits, but instead three specific terms viz? lauma, "soul" for the spirits of living, dirava, "ghost" for the spirits of the dead, and atane tano, "earth spirit" for spirits localized in trees arid stones who were responsible for sicknesses and other e\il? The choice was made for dirava which at the start was no doubt an ambigu ous term? Over the years, however, the original meaning has completely faded away, so that in the recent Motuan Bi ble it normally stands for God, while there are hardly any people left who still remember the old meaning? (45) A variation of the third approach is to use invented terms in a local language, which do not refer to any local deity? Thus in Mailu, on the south coast of Papua, the de signation Bo^ogoda, "Great Spirit", is used, while in parts of the Western Solomons people refer to God as Banara9 "chief", and this option is comparable to the Hew Guinea Pidgin term Bikpela for "Lord" (CAPELL 1959* 157)? ^ is not difficult to point out the inadequacies of these terms, because God is more than a spirit, even a great one, and he is not just a "big man" (which normally indicates an acqui red status, which also can be lost), but he is lord by his very being, or connaturally0 In these and other cases we should be fully aware of the semantic evolution of wordsf and this is often overlooked when for instance, early mis sionaries are blamed for not having introduced a local term for "God"? Nowadays it is usually too late to correct the direc tion embarked upon, because the old meanings are lost, and have been supplanted by other onesc For that reason it is no use to speculate on the relative merits of e?g? kaia (or for that matter, the impact of the impersonal ingal-power) as a better Kuanua term instead of the Catholic Deo or the Methodist Kalou? Whereas kaia is explained as "venerable, incomprehensible" and has, in an old dictionary, as first meanings "Spirit, or Higher spirits" (i?e? those above the tabaran ~ The spirits of the remote dead, and above the turagan ? the spirits of the recent dead) (0?MEYER 1921,s?v?) it was defined in 1940 as "an evil omnipresent spirit, who afflicts people with deformity and diseases, and is the cause of earthquakes, eruptions, etc?, and lives in craters, dark glens, etc?" and also as "any evil spirit, a large</page><page sequence="37">- 393 - snake, or anything much dreaded" (CAPELL 1959,156). It is clear that with such an evolution the term "becomes less and less suitable to indicate the good and benevolent cre ator spoken of by the missionaries. To conclude, then, the way to name the Christian God has been full of traps and no single principle was adopted to make him acceptable to the Melanesian mind. Similar judgments can be passed with regard to related topics, such as the benevolent angels and saints and the (by definition) malevolent demons and devils.(46) In traditional religion spirits - even ances tral spirits - are normally ambigious in their behaviour, and any quick identification or substitution is hardly ever justified. There is still the problem of the traditional deities? are thgy to be equated with the idols and false gods with which the Bible has familiarized us? Respect for indigenous feelings forbids us to call the object of local veneration a "false god" at alls for the people steeped in traditional religion, these gods are the true and only real gods, and this point has been made earlier in discussing the merits of a Christian Yakili. Again, as shown above, these dei ties often do not belong to the system, i.e. classical po lytheism, which for ages battled against biblical monothe ism. For that reason more appropriate models have been introduced. Nevertheless, it was inevitable that, at a time when the respective cults were still strong and alive, secrecy was observed by the worshippers, and misjudgments were likely to occur among observers and missionaries. But to be objective, one must take into account the spirit of the time and the theology of the past generations. Both have now changed, and invite us to revise the too negative opinions of the pasts native religion was not straight out "devil's work". On the contrary, it shows man's groping for the true god, with the same sincerity as has been ad mitted in Greek or Hindu culture. Greater insight into traditional religions can help us also to have a more di versified view of the extra-biblical world as well? With out going in details, and well aware that Egypt has not exercised the greatest influence on the shape of the Old Testament, we still feel that some illustrations from that land, featuring a hybrid divinity or a dyingreviving god,</page><page sequence="38">- 394 - might be sufficient to make the point*(47) They are dis tant historically unrelated, but still eloquent comments on some ideas we have met in Melanesia? In these cases the Melanesian myths, too, illustrate in words the ancient extra-biblical religion? Maybe such an association of ideas is one little gift that research into Melanesian culture can offer to the study of religion in general? NOTES 1e Sees "Les idees religieuses des Nkundo", ins Congo 17*19363 668-676? "La notion bantoue de Dieu", ins Revue du Clerge Africain (Mayidi) 23J 968, 184-188, and most recently? "Les Dieux des Mongo", ins Anthropos 75, 1980, 203-249* 2? It is noteworthy that early credal formulas, such as Deut 26, 5-6 and Jos 24, 2-13 do not contain creation as an article of faith (diff? Neh 9, 6-37) $ so that in the main we are left with Deutero-Isaiah. the priestly document (Gen 1), and a few psalms (Ps 8) (Compare VOIT RAD 1962, 136). Yet there is increasing evidence that the idea of Jahweh as creator is not incongruous with a much earlier period as a study of Canaanite religion (cf Gen 14? 19&lt;*222 "El Elyon, the creator of heaven and earth") and of Mesopotamia^ parallels (e*g* the myth "Emma elish") seems to indicate (MORIARTY 1969, 301-309). 3* Historically the theory about indwelling personified spirits (i.e* the animism of E?B. Tylor) was succeeded by pre-animism, dynamism or animatism, iee? the theory about a pervasive impersonal power, proposed by Ke T? Preuss and R?R? Marett (e*g* 1909)0 The latter depen ded directly on the "Melanesian" notion of mana? as first described by R*H* Codrington (1891, 1TBIT19)* In actual fact, mana might provide the clue ot the reli gious life on the Banks and Solomon Islands, visited by the missionary-anthropologist, but it is unwarran ted to apply it to the whole of Melanesia., as is often</page><page sequence="39">- 395 - done "by theorists. For a comparative stpdy of socie ties with (thus Guadalcanal and Mamaita) and without ^ a belief in mana (thus Wogeo Island and the Polynesian Ontong Java), see HOGBIN 1935/36. 4o Another term for henotheism (cf. F. SCHELLIIJG, MG MlL LER) is monolatry, ioe? worship (Greeks latreia) of only one (Greek: mono-) Gods in the sense of venerating him "as if91 he were the only existing god. In mono theism, on the contrary, god (theos) is unique vm?no-) on the practical and the speculative levelo It should be said, though, that contemporary anthropologists sel dom use the terms henotheism or monolatry, which now belong to the jargon of theologians? 5o The Polynesians and some African societies in Dahomey and among the Yoruba appear thus as exceptions to the classification given? In Polynesia we meet a definite social stratification, as eog. among the Tahitian no bility (arii), landowners (raatira or iatoai), and slaves (manahune), while the economic possibilities for not being generous are not unpredictible either, but tied to a stable and favourable climate? 6. We refer to HSU 1964 for comments on the usage and/or avoidance.of the term "primitive". 7o It is beyond doubt that there has been cultural and religious development, as shown by LACEY 1978 for the precolonial era, while some recent studies have poin ted out the changes which occurred in traditional myths since the beginning of this century (See SHERET 197$)o For the period between the first discovery in the 16th century and the re-discovery during last century, but mainly with regard to the material culture of the Polynesiansg see FRIEDERICI 1931 * 8? Broadly speaking, one can say that Melanesians, Micro nesians and Polynesians represent three successive wa ves of migrants coming from South East Asia and which reflect in their religious ideas the types of socie ties they left behind at the times of their departure, (see n? 17) 9? The comparison of culture heroes with biblical figures</page><page sequence="40">- 396 - is not limited to Noah who saved the human race, and is to the Greek Deucalion* Other examples, according to WALLIS 1943,2-3, are Abraham, the patriarch; Moses, the saviour from Egyptj Aaron, the founder of rituals and of temple worship; Joshua, the leader into the promised land; Saul, the founder of the monarchy; David, the builder of the capital a,nd the Holy City; and Salomon credited with the temple, its hymns and psalms, and with giving the nation an international xngoftance, ZAPLETAL 1906, 12 notes that Samson is visibly tue counterpart of the Greek Heracles (or Latin Hercules), but that scholars discuss whose picture has influenced the other one*s* We might add, in general, that there is very little evidence of any veneration of any of these Se mitic heroes, except possibly for Abraham and David* 10. LACEY 1979, 11-12, distinguishes for Melanesia three categories? (a) the culture heroes or culture bringers, who endow their people with basic institutions, skills and knowledge which are essential to their indentity and heritage as a people, (b) creator heroes who have the power to create or transform parts of the natural environment, and (c) founders whose names are sometimes preserved in the group names of their descendants0 11* Important studies concerning culture heroes and trick sters, but without direct relation to Melanesia ares BREYSIC 1905?

TEGNAEUS 1950 and RADIN 1956* Applications to Melanesia however, are found in LAWFENCE/MEGGITT 1965, passim (see Index), AUGENANGER 1970, and LACEY 1979o The terminology of LAWRENCE / MEGGITT is both helpful and somewhat particular* "Gods" are all spirit beings except ghosts and totems* They comprehend (p&lt;&gt;9)s (a) autonomous spirit beings which are creative and regulative at the same time, only cre ative (like the culture heroes) or only regulative* Then come (b) spirit beings which lack both functions such as "tricksters1'", demons and pucks? There are al so specific categories for the recent and the remote dead, and for the various types of totems* 12* VAN DEURSEN 1931, 351-360, indicates that among North American Indians culture heroes developed out of his</page><page sequence="41">- 397 - torical figures such as hero figures, chiefs, shamans, and prophets or holy men. He notes incidentally, that the mythical Manserum Mangundi, who has his place in the Koreri cargo movement in West Irian, was original ly a preacher of a Hindu sect(pc 356). 13? On the term masalai, see below page 25 and notes 29 and 33 14o See MALINOWSKI 1922, 369-371 (tfrobriand ls0) and JENNESS/ BALLANTONE 1928 (Goodenough Is.)? some native designs of sea ghosts are given by CODRIMGTON 1891,197 (Saa? Solomon Is.) and 259 (San Cristobal)0 15? The two themes recall the Genesis stoary^ where however Cain's murder of Abel (Gen 4,8) comes after the divine orders ?tBe fruitfulland multiply" (Gen 1, 27)0 This link was suggested by CAMPBELL 1960, 182, who associa tes Abel9s killing with the eating of the forbidden fruit (Gen 3, 6). We do not believe that one can that easely invert similar themes from a quite different context, especially because in the planters9 mythology the killing comes logically before the theme of lifeo At the most one could say that the deed of Cain is the first crime in an ever increasing series of sins, lea ding up to the disaster of the flood, and to the new humanity in Noah. (VON RAD 1962,158). 16b All aspects of the dema deities have been described by WIRZ 1922, esp. part 2, and most extensively by VAN BAAL 1966, whereas the Hainuwele myth was explained as the JTey to thii lWemal? Culture, by - JEISEH",, last ^df all in his book of 1966. 17o Relevant material from New Guinea and Melanesia has been collected by HATT 1951*889?895, who also compares it with the so called Corn Mother myths found in Ame** rica and with the Rice Mother motif of Indonesian fol klore. At the end of his study (pp0 904-908) some conclusions are drawn as to the relative antiquity of these complexes and as to their possible geographical connections. 180 Other myths using the same motifs are the Arapesh sto ry of the Cassowary Woman who taught men to make noose</page><page sequence="42">- 398 - traps for cassowaries and is caught herself, after which yams sprout forth from her hones (FORTUNE 1942, 231.232), or also the story collected among the Kai, near Finschhafen, about an ugly Yam Woman who after having met a compassionate man, relieves herself of the yams which deformed her body, and becomes a pret ty lady again (KEYSSER 1911, 222-22,5)* In the latter story the culture hero traits are very much obscured* 19* See KEYSSER 1911,34 (Kai)j LEHNER 1911, 494 (Bukaua); BAMLER 1911, 495 (Tami)| ERAMER-BANNOW 1916. 269 (New Ireland); BLACKWOOD 19359 195 (Bougainville); CQDRINO TON 1891, 80 (Banks Is*)* The whole complex is stu died by SFEISER 1944, who adds more references* 20* In another version (K1NNA 1972* 24) the man asked to be cooked in a pot, which later was found to be filled with taros, yams and Singapores* 21* In a Kiwai story the hero Sido passed into the skin of a pig, also assuming a pig*s head ("he stand up all same house"); he split open his stomach and spread out the sides like the roof of a house; his head faced the west, and the people entered the house from the east end* The connection with the dema ideology is empha sized by the fact that in olden times, at various sta ges of the building, some enemies were sacrified and certain parts of the house were smeared with their blood ("Put post - I ill bushman; make on-top-house kill bushman; put grass - kill bushman"), or also that at the completion of a men's house (darimo) two old people were supposed to die, just as the hero Maruno gere had died after he had built the first darimo (LMDTI.'IAJ- I9IT9 343? 1927, 22). 22* One might note that - whereas yams and tares are of Asian origin the white sweet potatoes are of American origin and were introduce d only in the 16th century by Spanish and Portuguese navigators* There are how ever, red and white varieties of taros (so called af ter the colours of the layers immediately under the outer rinds), and these might better fit the original myth*</page><page sequence="43">- 399 - 23* Besides Sido and Marungere, the Kiwai people have such other demas or heros as Begereduhu (LANDTMAN 1927, 19; 21; 60). Kuiamo (33; 36; 163). Merave (364), Meuri (36), Morave (46), Ifobearumo (19), Nimo and Puipui (319), Niigu (29), Paspae (116), Soido and Pekai (73), and possible still others. 24o One might think in particular of the Babylonian myth "Enuma Elish", in which the mother deity Tiamat is cut to pieces, out of which heaven and earth are made, or also of the god Marduk, out of whose blood mixed with clay men were made. However, there are comparable myths from Egypt, Phoenicia, Fhrygia and Greece, con veniently gathered by LEIPOIDT 1923* 25? Evidence for the Melanesian "creation through the word", has been collected by LAUPER 1961, and evaluated by JANSSEN 1975* His evidence for the "Papuan" Sulka is most enlightening; they distinguish between the verb lelgem ? "to produce someting" out of already existing material (as men do), and the expression kul reang (or also kuing) ? "to give birth, to put into existence" followed by "to talk", to speak", i.e. to produce by a mere word, which is reserved for the creator E Nut. 26. In some places the belief inja final conflagration after which there will be only dark night, or of a great flood after which there will only be endless sea (as found on central New Ireland, cf NEUHAUS 1934, 88-89) can be explained historically by the rain of ashes of a vulcano or the occurence of springtides. Yet these facts of recent memory may not suffice to explain the belief, since there is also some indica tion of a sky being in whose power it is to cause the end of the world (ibid., 15)* One is struck by the similarity of the old Panggu with the Greek Atlas, who was punished in having to bear heavens on is head or shoulders, and who in later tra dition was changed into a mountain which kept increa sing till it supported the heavens. Cf KLEINTITSCHEN 1924, who on p. 18-22 refers tales about the activities of the snake spirit (in Kuanua: 27. 28.</page><page sequence="44">- 400 - kaia, literallys wonderful, incomprehensible), while on po 22-24 and* 70-73 he gives other stories centered around an unnamed old mowan (See the English transla tion in JAKSSEN/MEHNIS/SKIKSER 1973, resp? p. 3*34 and 39? 92-95) .

It is interesting to note that the North Bougainvilleans speak about one Moroko hehon, also known as "kokorra"9 whose anthropomorphic, but asexual representations are found on paddles and</page><page sequence="45">- 4Q1 - canoes, and who was identified by the locals with what the missionaries called "God" ("all same Father call em God"): BLACKWOOD 1935, 435. 33* LAWEESCE- 1965, 222 n. 11 considers the fact that Pfe rambik, a masalai of the Ngaing (Rai Coast) has no specific habitat is a decisive element in classifying him as a true deity (tut)f and not as a culture hero, who by definition establishes things and then leaves human society 34* On the Gazelle Peninsula the kaia is described as "the one who was always there" (j* MEIER 1909, 13, n0 1)s on the Duke of York Island the primal being is refer red to as "He who made us" (BROWN 1910, 199), while on New Ireland we meet Hintubuhet, i.e. "our mother an cestor" (PEEKEL 1910, 5) or more probably "our ances tor in~the-female-line" (NEUHAUS 1934, 12, 15)* Com parable with these three Melanesian societies, one might quote also the "Papuan" Bainings, who address Rigenmucha, i?ee "nobody made himt1,variously as? Morka, "Mighty one", Sarucha, "Venerable" and Mamok, "Father" (LAUFER 1961, 98, summariziring 1946/49, 509-513). 35? In Christian theology providence is often seen as a continued creative act, which allows for a more dyna mic view of God's care for the world, as actually shown in the sending of his Son (Heb 1, 1-3). In the same view there is no question of God suffering any competition from lesser spirits (Rom 8, 38) or of man kind being unable to approach God (Heb 4, 14-16)* Some authors add, regarding many non^western: societies, that their tightening of social structures shows an apparent attempt to replace the security once seen as proceeding directly from God, with one seen to proceed primarily from the society, maybe as God's intermedi ary (KRAFT 1979,109). Such a replacement theory smacks however, of an evolutionistic outlook which is totally unwarranted. 36. One opinion holds that agriculture was discovered when people saw how tubers grew from the tomb gifts which they had buried with their dead leaders; these sprang as it were "from the body" of the deceased ones, and</page><page sequence="46">- 402 - could be seen as their "gifts" to those left behind* Such a theory involves, however, too much speculation, while at the same time simpler explanations are avail able, e.g. the spontaneous grcowth of tubers on old rubbish heaps, discovered when people visited or re turned to their previous settlements. 37. The term "ghost" as distinct from "spirit", was pro posed already by CODRINGTON 1891, 120-123, and is ba sed on the fact whether a supernatural being ever left a human body, or whether it was never in one. A "ghost" of a deceased person is known in Pidgin as a tamberan9 a word borrowed from a Melanesian term, used e.g. on the Gazelle Peninsula. (Cf BURGMANN 1968), In the literature ancestors* veneration is referred to as "manism" (from the Latin manesg "shades,ancestral spi rits". There is no relation with E.B. Tyler's "ani mism" or with R.R.Marett's ^animatism" referred to supra, note 3? 38. One will recall that the three means of communication are quasi universal. To give just one reference, one can point to the biblical example of Joseph's dreams (Gn 35; 40; 41), of Samuel's or other prophet's tran ces (T Sam 10, 10-12; 2 Sam 23,2), and to such animals as the doves of Noah (Gn 8,8-12) and, the donkey of Balaam (22,22-35? see also Job 12, J~8). 39* LAWRENCE/MEGGITT 1965, 11-14 make some generalizations about the attitudes of Highlands and Seaboard Peoples towards the deceased, but some of their conclusions are not warranted, as pointed out by CROWNING 1967. 40. Supplementary information on the Huli is given in a paper by B.S. GAYALU, read at the Seminar on Religion in Melanesia (Gbroka. 1978). It speeks about the place of worship (gebeanda)? the "priests" (gebeali) and the ceremonies they perform in honour of a higher being "whose name is not to be mentioned in vain". 41*" For other societies in which the deistic principle is largely or entirely i -nored, compare LAWRENCE/MEGGITT 1965, 11. 42. Intimate relationships with a person's own spirit</page><page sequence="47">- 403 - seems to be reflected in such biblical names as "the God of Abraham" (On 31, 53), "the Kinsman of Isaac" (31,42) and "the Mighty one of Jacob" (49,24), and is parallelled in Melanesia where we meet expressions such as "the Spirit(?) of So and So,f, which is protec tive and avenging according to the circumstances. For an example from the Bainings,* regarding the masa lai bilong Pulia see HESSE-AERTS 1979, 32 and photo 20. 43 Whereas older Bibles "in the Blanche Bay dialect" use Kalout the more recent version "in Tinata tuna" .(1976) has adopted the English term God. Tuna or Ruana are the more common designations of this language spoken by the Tolai people, living on the Gazelle peninsula. We .might add that, among several dozens of Bible trans lations from Papua New Guinea; only one had the com bined English and local term, i.e. "Aninu God", found in the Bukiyup version (Mount Arapesh), produced by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. 44* 'Examples of this t^pe of syncretism occur when, e#g. the Big and Small Nut are equated with God the Father and his Son Jesus, or with God and Satan. For other examples of culture blending, see McGREGGOR 1974 and AHRENS (n.d.) (e.g. p. 63 for taking Anut and the ancestors as models for God and Jesus). 45? BROWN 19? s.v., shows that in Toaripi too we find spe cific names for the spirit of a man (ove ? soul), the spirit of a dead person (karisu or harisu ? ghost), and the spirits living in a tree etc. (arahoha or arahoa =spirit). The last term was chosen to desig* nate the Holy Spirit (Safu arahoha lareva.i.e. taboo spirit good), but ove lareva is also used). In addi tion there was the common name ualare or ualari to designate the mythical ancestors of the several clans, such as Meava Kivovia, Toi Vita, Oa-Laea, etc. The early missionaries adopted for "God" the term Karisu (cf. Motu: Dirava)t btit tljSumore recent translations have chosen Ualere. Incidentally, it might be noted that the name of one particular culture bringer, Oa laea, is used to name the biblical monster Leviathan (Ps 74, U)o</page><page sequence="48">- 404 - 46a The term "demon", which in Attic Greek meant a supers natural "being that influenced a person's character, is less definite than the term "devil" - although it is often taken as its synonym, especially - in later Greek. In fact, the Sew Testament does not make any noticea ble difference between "demon" and "unclean spirit". 47* Osiris appears historically firfet as a shepherd from Lower Egypt, who was killed by a wild animal in de fence of his flock, and then mourned by his sister* Later he is transformed into an agricultural god, who represents the fertile land drowned "in his water", and is also associated with the grain which dies and so lives on. In this deified form he is opposed to the desert god Seth (Upper Egypt) and associated with Isis who is believed to be his sister. Still later he is represented as a king killed by his brother Seth| his body is thrown in the File; when the parts are gathered again, he revives and becomes the king and judge of the dead; the deceased kings are belie ved to become assimilated into him. H Osiris9 cult shows therefore the ambiguity of a giver of fertility and a lord of the dead, and this is explained through the accumulation of heterogeneous elements from va rious places and different periods of time. Hence the need to avoid &amp;my synthesis which disrepects the his torical evolution. CAPTIONS TO THE ILLUSTRATIONS AA ( p. 9) The war- and hunting god Ylisso is a wooden statue of 1,71 m high, all covered with red ochre, and dressed with a skirt of sagoleaf fibreSo On the belt is at tached a bone dagger, and two pouches, one decorated with pig tusks, the votive gifts of some "big men" who want the defeat of their enemies* The head is made of a pigys skull, wood, earthenware and wicker work, and is placed upon the wooden sculpture, recal ling some of the ancestor representations elsewhere in New Guinea (Design after Anthropos 47, 1952, opposite Po904)o</page><page sequence="49">U</page><page sequence="50">U</page><page sequence="51">U</page><page sequence="52">U</page><page sequence="53">-405 - BB (p. 369 ) Payt of the dema cult are dramatic plays in which the plants given or also some acts out of the primal time are represented. Such a ritual re-enactment assures the preservation of the present environment and assu res fertility of men and plants alike. The coconut dema from among the Marind?Anim caries a one meter high cocos palm on his head decorated with stylized leaves and fruits. In the stem there is a smal human figure, the ancestor of the clan of the coconut. The tree*s roots are shown as the legs and feet of the dema (after WIRZ 1922) CC (p 391 ) Some conspicuous stones are often related to the cul ture heroes of a place. The one represented here is "believed to be the petrified modfel of the first canoe, which Bakokora gave the Karomira people on South Bou gainville Island. There are in the near surroundings also three stones, forming a triangle, and a fourth one ressembling a cooking pot turned upside down, which indicate the original fire place of Bakokora (Design after Anthropos 6, 1911t 814)* DD (P. 393 After the mythical king Osiris, who had introduced a griculture in Lower Egypt, was killed by his brother Seth, he was buried in the Nile (or parts of his body spread out over the land).
