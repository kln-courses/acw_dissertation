<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading In Memoriam Timothy Peltason/Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1985. Pp. xii+ 181. Tennyson and Personification: The Rhetoric of "Tithonus" Daniel A. Harris/Ann Arbor, Mich.: UMI Research Press, 1986. Pp. xvi+ 142. Both of these books present the extended implications of reading a Tennyson poem as, for the large part, a dramatic monologue. From such a perspective, the speaker of the poem presents for our critical appreciation the establishment of a self on emotional grounds, not on assertions about world and time. Ideas necessarily become problematical through the mirrorings of the form. In Reading "In Memoriam" Timothy Peltason finds, through the "close and critical reading of individual lyrics"-"consecutively and cumulatively" (p. x)-that the poet's (the speaker's) "large movement from grief to affirmation" is not based on the "working-through of a necessary and rational plan" or "argument" but on the "arranging impulse in human consciousness" (pp. 11-12), on the "authority and vitality of his own imagination and feeling" (p. 155). The "poet makes and expresses himself" and "not a doctrine of any kind"; his "emotional recovery is a healing and directing of the power of self-assertion" (p. 163). The poem is full of arguments that look like reasons for recovery-an identification with an ameliorative process in nature and history, say (a brief description of these is on p. 12)-but such doctrines are continually undercut by the fact that opposing emotions attend them. So we must see the "anteriority of mood to argument," moods that "deny the place of argument in feeling." Yet the "poet does progress" but through the "sequence and opposition" of "different arguments for feeling one way or another." The sequence "constitutes an argument," but we must see that it is an emotional and not a rational one. Through this emotional argument the poem "can compel assent or admiration" with respect to the movement to affirmation, although we may not see this from the outside but, rather, through "our experiences of inwardness." But even this sense of inward progress is quite "separable" from whatever may be inferred locally because of the "complexity and resistance of individual lyrics" (pp. 10-11). As Peltason explains (p. 14), his formulations are like those of The Poetry of Experience (New York, 1957) where, in Robert Langbaum's words, the</page><page sequence="2">336 Modern Philology (February 1988) "doctrine of experience" makes our sympathy "primary" and the "analytic reflection that follows.. . secondary and problematical," with a "deliberate disequilibrium between experience and idea" (p. 35). Peltason says he questions this hierarchy. Indeed, where Langbaum finds that "one or more ideas can be extracted as problematical rationalizations" (p. 36) from any given experience, it seems that Peltason finds that different emotions may be extracted from any of In Memoriam's ideas. Thus, while Peltason grants that section 115 shows that the "poet's regret is absorbed into the process of renewal"-the renewal that comes through the identifi- cation with natural process ("my regret / Becomes an April violet")-he finds this "undeniable affirmation" opposed by a "trancelike compression and stillness." The elements here are "strangely intransitive" because of an "enclosure of repetitions" the "verbal formula 'x to x' turns an expanse into an encirclement." This section "greets the coming spring, but does not itself look forward" because the poet "seeks an encounter, now and face to face, with that which is" (pp. 135-36). In section 118, with its apparent paean to universal progress (though "battered with the shocks of doom"), Peltason notes the poet's "spiritual recovery" but notes also a "subversive strain within this happy reconciliation" because, as Peltason feels, the recovery is not "proved from within." We know this because the concluding lyrics of In Memoriam "reveal a decided return to an earlier valuation of the private and the mystical" (pp. 139-40). People have thought that the "shocks of doom" refer to the Phoenix-Death-Birth idea of the time and that it may have something to do with how "men may rise on stepping-stones / Of their dead selves to higher things" (sec. 1) and how "spirit walks" through "shattered stalks, / Or ruined chrysalis of one" (sect. 82)-that is, progress occurs in this way-but Peltason regards the stepping-stones idea only as the poet's "grim exploitation" of Hallam's death (p. 21), the idea "that one dead creature may subserve the gain of another" (p. 83), and he does not mention the celebrated lines from section 82 at all. Peltason says of section 124 that the "heart does recover its strength in this lyric, but only because it is like a child that, 'crying, knows its father near.'" The attempt to find God "fails" here, and certainly the "poet rejects the argument from design." The faith here is "enfeebled," and so it must follow that the recovery is not due to any idea the poet may have. Rather, this section shows merely that "there are strong feelings and weak ones" and that, somehow, the strong feelings here result from the reasonless "I have felt." The section ends, of course, with the reference to the "hands / That reach through nature, moulding men," but of this Peltason can say only that "Hallam's hands get mixed up here with God's" (pp. 152-53). There are several references to hands in the poem; in section 80, "Unused example from the grave / Reach out dead hands to comfort me," and Christopher Ricks's note in The Poems of Tennyson (London, 1969) indicates some other poems in which Tennyson used the idea that these hands are the memory of the heroic dead. But Peltason is not interested in image patterns, nor in arguing for or against various interpreta- tions, and certainly he is free to assert the poet's spiritual recovery as, finally, a "mystical" one. Because Peltason continually stresses how the sections of In Memoriam make him feel (whatever the thought), he has some grounds for asserting the uniqueness of his approach. "There is no book," he says, "that attempts to read" the poem "as I have," because he is "willing to look longer and harder at the language than have</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 337 other critics" (p. x). Though it may be thought that others have pondered as deeply, yet no one has divorced experience and idea so severely. Peltason seems to show that renewal and recovery accompany the progression of ideas, but he finds that, at any time, these emotions are opposed by contradictory ones, either because of something in the language, the rhetoric, or because of the dominance of a con- clusive mysticism that dissolves any apparent consolation the poet may seem to be taking in ideas. This latter strategy may appear to utilize the very teleology that Peltason condemns--reasoning in terms of "narrative outcome" (p. I1l)-but he means to deny the validity of a sequence of thought in the poem, not a sequence of emotions whose logic is, finally, mystical. He finds, indeed, that the poet's strongest emotions arise from an implicit rejection of ideas. Of course, we cannot doubt that Peltason is describing what he feels, but, given the difficulty of talking about emotions without reasons, or objective correlatives, and given, too, the task of persuading his readers, it is odd that he distances himself so from what is surely the prevailing tendency of modern critics to find that the poet's recovery is due to an emotional transvaluation, through the making of himself, psychologically, aesthetically, and spiritually. Anyone arguing that this recovery is due to ideas is certainly going against the critical grain. Graham Hough contends that the poet's recovery was based on a "completely cogent mystical experience" ("The Natural Theology of In Memoriam," Review of English Studies O.S. 23 [1947]: 256). Jerome Hamilton Buckley finds the poet's "spiritual recovery" in his "mystical insight" (Tennyson: The Growth of a Poet [Cambridge, Mass., 1960]). Carlisle Moore speaks to a variety of "trance-like experience[s]" in the poem ("Faith, Doubt, and Mystical Experience in In Memoriam," Victorian Studies 7 [1963]: 158). J. C. C. Mays says that the poet "presents the drama of himself in the very process of discovering" form and therefore meaning ("In Memoriam: An Aspect of Form," University of Toronto Quarterly 35 [1965]: 26). Eugene R. August writes that the poet represents "spiritual growth" or "evolution" becoming "conscious of itself" ("Tennyson and Teilhard: The Faith of In Memoriam," PMLA 84 [1969]: 221). Langbaum himself argues the poet's "transformation of perception," in which "all the old facts and problems are transvaluated" ("The Dynamic Unity of In Memoriam," in The Modern Spirit [New York, 1970], p. 69). Peltason does not seek the support of any of these studies, or of many others that might be brought to bear on his discussion. Of course, he is aware of this background, so there must be something more here than meets the eye. One might think that Peltason's disin- clination to use a critical context is due to his concern that attention paid to critics would disturb the integrity of his meditation. There is something in this. Peltason's reading is idiosyncratic, in the best sense of this word. It is his reading, and the subtleties of others would distract. Too, Peltason does say that in his "fondest and grandest dreams" his audience consists of those who "have read around in the poem": people who are interested in poetry "but for whom In Memoriam is not a very big or well-remembered feature of the landscape" (p. ix). Certainly, he achieves this objective. If Peltason declines a heavy scholarly context, Daniel A. Harris in Tennyson and Personification: The Rhetoric of "Tithonus" embraces it with thirty pages of annotated documentation appended to a 105-page text. This book is one in the series Nineteenth-Century Studies, edited by a sterling board and put out by the remarkable UMI Research Press, an imprint of University Microfilms International,</page><page sequence="4">338 Modern Philology (February 1988) hitherto known mostly for putting dissertations on film. It now publishes a great many books, no doubt because of the resources made available first through its acquisition by the Xerox Corporation and now through its sale to Bell and Howell. This corporate identity, we may think, is why Harris's book cost $40 (against Peltason's at $25). Harris finds in Tennyson's short poem some extraordinary dimensions in the "self-mirroring structure that is intrinsic to dramatic monologue," namely, in the doubling, and redoubling, of self. Through "sympathetic" impersonation or "self- masking," Tennyson creates a fictive Tithonus, who in turn creates a fictive Dawn "as an act of projection" (personification) that is "egocentric" and "imperialist" in nature. This distinction between the two meanings of the traditional rhetorical term prosopopoeia is central to Harris's analysis. It is a bit confusing, however, to be told that Tithonus was "projected by Tennyson" by way of (here Harris cites Lowth's 1753 Lectures) "fictitious speech ... assigned to a real character," but that we know Dawn to be "not a goddess or a 'real' character" because the "poet's evident creation of a fictive character is structurally duplicated in the monologist's relations with his auditor." In any event, the "fruitful tension" between impersona- tion and personification reveals that the "chief preoccupation" of the poem is its own "method" of "duplicated impersonations." (Not "duplicated personifications?" Especially because Dawn is "no more than a personification.") Still, the "self- reflexiveness" here, the "self-mirroring relations," put into question the very "notion of 'person,'" which reflects "nineteenth-century revolutions in psychological theory" (pp. 14-15). But because Tithonus creates divinity, fictive as it may be, the act of personification is not without theological implications. In the 1986 UMI Research Press Catalog, Harris says he examines the poem "by means of rhetorical technique rather than theme" to find that "Tennyson stresses the psychic act of personifying rather than the phenomenon or idea personified. His experiments in personifi- cation... provide access to pre-Freudian conceptions of projection and transfer- ence. The poem becomes an exhibition of metaphoric behavior that displays some illuminating correspondences with contemporaneous developments in Victorian theology and anthropology-notably Tractarian polemics on the Eucharist and Tylor's analyses of animism" (p. 59). Harris ranges over this expanse with erudition and skill. So "Tithonus" should not be understood in terms of autobiography, such as Tennyson's grief over Hallam's death (the poem is thus not a pendant to "Ulysses"), nor through aesthetic terms that reflect concerns about the role of the poet, nor as a Romantic "crisis" poem (nn. I and 26 to chap. 1). Rather, we should see it as an exhibition of Tennyson's rhetorical craft in working the dramatic monologue. Though Harris warns us off theme and idea, phenomenon and presence, we yet may see that Tithonus is a "person" with certain psychological problems. Nor does Harris evade the fact that Tithonus has some characteristics commonly understood as Tennyson's. This is to say, Harris's portrait is not without interest for an understanding of Tennyson's neurotic black melancholy, if with more of a sexual twist than it is normally given. Harris finds the poem to be informed by the "pain" of a mind in "paralysis." The "frustrations," the sense of "entrapment," are due to "his lost virility and sexual victimization by Eos," also to "his linguistic behavior," the inability to distinguish</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 339 between "abstraction, personification, and phenomenon" (pp. 1-2). The "decay of his body parallels the loss of his personhood," a "withered depersonation" that "dramatizes the characteristic Tennysonian longing for a vanished past"-that is, Tennyson's celebrated "passion of the past." Yet this past exists in the "midst of abundance and plenitude," for he "still, perhaps, has coitus with the goddess," though, to be sure, she comes "to prey upon him" (p. 4). On the other hand, she is a "being from Tithonus' own person" (p. 5) and thus represents the "motives behind Tithonus' death wish," motives "typical of Tennyson's suicidal characters who can find no middle ground, no psychic place of resolution, between neurosis (or emotional despair) and death" (p. 7). Tennyson's "great recognition" is "that personification is a literary and psychological procedure that... generates a re- duction of self," that is, Tithonus "personifies the personifying process itself" (p. 9). Thus, logically enough, his "personification of the dawn involves feelings of sexual desire" and "passive masturbation" but not only this: also "shy intimations of his godlike potentiality, and so forth" (p. 11). So the poem is also "about theogony, god-formation," but only insofar as this is the "consequence of a linguistic event," without "reference to any transcendental ontology." Tennyson's "daring" here is "his view that the gods as envisaged are the product of human mentation, earth- bound psychological needs," which is what Tennyson meant by saying that "our highest view of God must be more or less anthropomorphic" (p. 12). We can hardly think that Harris fails here in his own daring. The argument doubles and redoubles and mirrors all its aspects in a most satisfying manner. One may think that, surely, "Tithonus" is not about degenerative sex and therefore deity, but then this is the path that misleads to theme and idea, worse, to the Tennysonian presence. Rather, we are to admire Tennyson the superb rhetorician whose skills, even if drawn from instinct, suggest that he is among the most intelligent of poets.
