At first one may be highlights how indeed a certain poetry might be written after baffled by its project. One who glances at the title might Auschwitz, contra Adorno's famous injunction. Finally, inso think at first of the unsettled position of Romanticism within far as the poem echoes Coleridge, it proposes that a specifi the history of bio-power, the formation of modern bureau- cally Romantic poetics survives Auschwitz as well, that The cratic regimes, the history of racialized representation, the Rime already broached certain figurai strategies crucial to beginnings of modern mass culture, or the emergence of ide- Levi.

One would be right to do so: the is meant to suggest that poetry survives Auschwitz precisely place of Romanticism within these trajectories, which do because something of Romanticism survives as well - in the eventually include Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, should rhetoric of survival, remain a part of the critical and historical agenda. Thus when one first opens the book to discover that it focuses in- In an introduction and first chapter, Guyer lays out the stead on the problems of prosopopoeia, apostrophe, anthropo- broad dimensions of her project, citing a range of key discus morphism, and the witness, the effect is disconcerting: how sions to refine her claims.

Guyer clarifies the stakes of her title from the very start. "[A]lready in romanticism," she writes, "lyric figures generate In her opening pages, she analyzes Primo Levi's poem, "The a life beyond life, a life of passivity and impossible dying, Survivor," which begins with lines from The Rime of the Ancient whose beginnings and ends can be posited but not repre Mariner. To read this poem well, one must attend both to the sented and whose positings perpetually unsettle rather than tropes by which it animates and addresses the dead and to its affirm the ends at issue" (13). In this poetics of survival, art attempt to bear responsibility to those whose deaths Levi does not triumph, nor does it disappear; poetry "is the condi could not fully witness.

If de Man insists that pro- that in attempting to set aside personification and put the sopopoeia "claims and fails to overcome" the "impossibility of reader in the "company of flesh and blood," Wordsworth seeing," so too does Agamben (43-44).
