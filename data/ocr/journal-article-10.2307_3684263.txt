<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kellman, Steven G. The Self-Begetting Novel. New York: Columbia University Press, 1980. Steven G. Kellman's book fulfills with admirable clarity its primary objective: to demonstrate the existence and importance within modern fiction of a subgenre which he proposes to call. the "self-begetting novel." Analyzing an array of French, English, and American novels, Kellman elaborates his initial definitions of the subgenre as "the modernist fantasy of autogeny" or again as "an account, usually first-person, of the development of a character to the point at which he is able to take up his pen and compose the novel we have just finished reading" (p. 3). The book includes chapters on Proust, Sartre, Beckett and "Butor and Beyond," as well as consideration of novels by Lawrence Durrell, James Joyce, Doris Lessing, Henry Miller, Iris Murdoch and others. All the novels studied blend the bildungsroman and kunstlerroman traditions in order to chart the itinerary or - to borrow the book's dominant metaphor - the labor of an artist giving birth simultaneously to a novel and a self. The book's importance lies in the discovery and description of this tradition of self-begotten fiction. At the same time, it is in its central metaphor, announced by its title, that I find two major conceptual limitations that mar the book's overall effectiveness. First, The Self-Begetting Novel fails to explore the implications of its own terminology. Except in a very general sense, none of the novels discussed is literally "self-begetting" or "autogenous" at all. Although each novel attempts to create "the illusion of art creating itself," there is an intermediate step: a fictional author. In other words, the novel is' supposedly begotten from within by a character engaged in an existential struggle to become an artist. Proust or Sartre, for example, creates a novelist (Marcel or Roquentin) who in turn begets a novel (A la Recherche du temps perdu or La Nausie). Novels, even within fiction, are still written by novelists. This might seem a mere nit-picking detail except for the fact that many contempo- rary novels, especially in France, offer a significantly different but related fantasy of autogeny. Novels by Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jean Ricardou, the Butor of the 1960s, and the Claude Simon of the 1970s, for example, claim to generate themselves without benefit of an anthropomorphic begettor. Many of these novels - for example Projet pour une revolution d New York, La Prise (or Prose) de Constantinople, Mobile, Triptyque--have no developed characters at all. In fact, the structuralist and post-structuralist emphasis on textual production relies on an ideology and practice of autogenous language. In Beckett's fiction, minimal characters appear on the scene only to express their inability to beget either novel or self, and what little story there is is born of silence, refusal, absence and lack. These suicidal or self-aborting novels are dimensiops of Kellman's subject which</page><page sequence="2">104 Reviews could have been treated if the book had established more careful distinctions among self-reflexive, self-conscious, and self-begetting fictions, categories which, although often found together, are not synonymous. All literature is to some degree self-conscious; aware of its own literariness, it consciously manipulates conventions and breaks rules, thereby revealing them. Self-reflexive writing is self-conscious, but in addition, it talks about itself, represents itself metaphorically, and reflects explicitly on its own condi- tions of possibility. The fiction Kellman discusses is self-reflexive by means of its internal novelist figure. Very few novels actually pretend to be self-generating, and those that do deliberately create what Kellman correctly labels an "illusion," a "fantasy," and even a "delusion." What characterizes some contemporary fiction is its attempt to push all three categories to unprecedented limits, opening it to charges of narcissism and solip- sism. Although one chapter is entitled "Butor and Beyond," Kellman's framework does not allow him to venture beyond novels with realistic characters. His refusal to recog- nize possible separation of existential and textual autogeny causes him to overlook what could have been useful distinctions between modernist and postmodernist writing. A second problem is likewise that of his book's failure to take its guiding metaphor seriously enough. In his preface, Kellman states that this study was "born of fascina- tion with a kind of novel whose very form demonstrates radical longing to overcome a generation gap by merging parent and child into one enduring unit." That unit is, of course, the book which contains representations of its own creator/progenitor. Kell- man's subject, then, is the relationship between novelists and their novels, a relation- ship often expressed as familial. What Kellman calls "organic metaphors of reproduc- tion" (i.e., "begetting," "conception," "gestation," "pregnancy," "labor," and "birth") have often been used to describe artistic and intellectual endeavor. Use of procreative imagery to describe artistic creation is explored here in light of two archetypal families: the Oedipal configuration and the New Testament Father and Son. While both these models yield interesting insights, they also pave the way for one of the book's most unfortunate limi- tations. By the end of the introduction, the biblical and psychoanalytic models have significantly distorted and reduced the "parent and child" referred to in the preface. Conception, gestation, and birth are collapsed into one all-purpose image, and the rest of the book sees the self-begetting novel as synonymous with "the creation of a new self as both father and son" (p. 83). But while all the novelists discussed are at least hypothetically capable of begetting both novels and children, gestation, pregnancy, labor and giving birth are unique to women. All but two of the novelists Kellman discusses in detail are men, but nowhere is the relevance of this simple fact so much as men- tioned. The inclusion of Lessing and Murdoch could have provided the opportunity to ask whether women writers link procreation and creation in the same ways as men, but instead, novelists are simply presumed implicitly and all too metaphorically to "father" novels. The book teems with unacknowledged motherhood, however, as is most outrageously evident in a discussion of Henry Miller. The hero of Tropic of Cancer, we are told, imagines what intercourse would be like if he were a woman, and later we read of the gestation of a novel in the belly of a male novelist: "Nobody pushes me rudely any more. I am pregnant. I waddle awkwardly, my big stomach pressed against the weight of the world" (Kellman, p. 125, quoting Miller). These enormities are dismissed as Miller's "comic touch" and "epic simile" respectively. More complete consideration of Miller's birth imagery might have led to better understanding of Beckett's simultaneous and contra- dictory quest for mother and immortality. The fantasy of autogeny seems, in many examples, less a rivalry or fusion of son and father than a wish to become the mother of one's novel and self. Yet no attempt is made to ask what might be the significance</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 105 of a wholesale adoption of female imagery by male novelists. I This question could have been addressed in light of the psychoanalytic perspective invoked briefly in the intro- duction and especially after having mentioned "Rank's insight into the ambivalence of male sexuality" (p. 1). Bringing such ambivalence to the surface of the critical text might have highlighted modern fiction's attempt to subvert temporal, narrative and genealogical linearity. The book's dedication-- "To Mother"-- might serve as an apology for blind spots shared by novelists and critic. Although Kellman's subject is far richer than he allows it to become, The Self-Begetting Novel makes a valuable contribution to scholarship on the modern novel by proposing a useful context of subgenre in which further questions can be asked. Its well-written, insightful and thought-provoking readings of individual novels prove the value, if also the limits, of its chosen field of inquiry. Lynn A. Higgins Dartmouth College NOTES 1.
