Pp. 280. N.P. According to Jewish tradition, the received text of the Hebrew Bible has under- gone several changes (tiqqûnîm) at the hands of scribes ( sõphèrím ) who sought to obscure seemingly inappropriate statements about God. In this volume, Sister Carmel McCarthy explores both the development of this tradition as well as avail- able evidence regarding its accuracy. Although it eventually became normative to claim a total of eighteen such changes, early reports differ as to both the number and identity of the passages involved. Actual lists of tiqqûnê sõphèrím are rarely that extensive. Moreover, tex- tual evidence supports the claimed original for only a few of the passages ( 1 Sam 3:13; Zech 2:12; Job 7:2), leading M. to conclude that most reflect homiletical inter- pretations rather than an accurate memory of earlier readings. Of particular value is the fact that, as her subtitle implies, M. has gone beyond the issue of tiqqûnê sõphèrím in order to explore more general questions, including the extensive number of W-tiqrê interpretations found in rabbinic literature. She also examines other rabbinic traditions regarding textual changes such as those supposedly made when the Pentateuch was translated into Greek for King Ptolemy which, according to one report, also numbered eighteen, although no extant list includes that many passages. Given the breadth of her interest, it is surprising that she avoids other such traditions, including references to unique readings in Rabbi Meir's Torah and the kètîb-qèrê , even though both the footnotes and bibliography clearly demonstrate that she is aware of these. Among this study's most useful insights is the distinction between what M. calls "secondary euphemisms/' which are the product of scribal changes, and "original euphemisms," in which the substitution was made by the author himself (e.g., the use of kèbôdô in Jer 2:1 1 or the insertion of õyèbê in 2 Sam 12:14). The distinction is important in that it warns against hasty classification of all such cases under the heading "emendation"; furthermore, original euphemisms offer a valuable example of a case in which a word's literal meaning must be distinguished from the sense it is intended to convey. The distinction, however, raises problems for M.'s own metho- dology which evaluates the traditional claims of scribal changes on the basis of evidence from the versions. It is conceivable that ancient translators rendered what they recognized as a euphemism according to its intent rather than its literal meaning. M. herself produces evidence of such cases (p. 193) which serve to signal the dangers implicit in seeking to reconstruct a Vorlage on the basis of such evidence. This study raises several problems relating to the Jewish attitude towards the biblical text. It is well known, for example, that certain strains of rabbinic tradition came to regard every letter as authoritative; the tiqqûnê sõphèrím tradition demon- strates that rabbis could and indeed did believe that their text was neither identical with the original nor in itself sacrosanct. The question of consistency within that tradition is also problematic. M. is able to demonstrate quite convincingly the pres- ence of theologically motivated euphemisms, both original and secondary, through-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 485 out the biblical text, albeit most often in passages other than those listed in the various tiqqûnè sôphërîm traditions. If, however, Jewish tradition could admit to and tolerate changes in the biblical text (according to M., b. Yebam. 79a even encourages this practice where necessary to avoid blasphemy), then one can only wonder why so few passages have been changed. Only a handful of tiqqûnîm are claimed for the Book of Job which is filled with such statements, while the process which replaced "seeing Yahweh's face" (r&gt;h pny Yhwh ) with "appearing before Yahweh" (nr^h [H] pny Yhwh ) has not been so thorough as to obscure all traces of this kind of anthropomorphism (e.g., Gen 22:14). It is not enough to claim that the "rabbinic mind" did not share our modern preoccupation with thoroughness when relatively minor statements are corrected and more blatant "blasphemies" permitted to remain. M. tends, rather unfortunately, to blur the lines between talmudic and medieval Jewish exegesis by incorporating both under the rubric "rabbinic," a term better left for the Tannaitic and Amoraic periods. Nevertheless, her evaluation of the tech- niques on which the iiqqûnê sôphërîm and, indeed, other ancient traditions rely indicates several striking parallels to later medieval methods, including such princi- ples as consonant interchange and even word substitution which is most commonly associated with the eleventh-century Spanish grammarian Jonah ibn Janah. De- spite the very real and important differences between rabbinic and medieval tech- niques, the question of an underlying continuity, which this study suggests, merits careful examination. In sum, this is a first-rate piece of scholarship, revealing an impressive mastery of both contemporary and traditional literature. Moreover, its value extends beyond M.*s ability to clarify a difficult issue in a thorough and convincing way, for she also points to further issues which will require réévaluation in light of her results.
