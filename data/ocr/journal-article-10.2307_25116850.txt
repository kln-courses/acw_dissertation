<plain_text><page sequence="1">Get ??ith Child A CDandrake 'Root D The pig is praying, as well as he might; he has been seized by a Griffin . . . but that's okay, Mary. Stale air heavy with heat, cigar smoke, and perspiration smells mixing into the memory of three tortuous months of argument were too much for her: Martha vomited. 'And as dutiful Children let us cover the Nakednesse of our Fathers with the cloke of a favor able Interpretation.' And then she passed into a silent world where she was frozen at the bottom of a trans parent block of ice, and Stephan was skating on top of her with another woman who was skating in circles. Leo the Lion, the mightiest of beasts, will stand up to anybody; but while trying to do a fancy figure for the woman, Stephan fell down. "Can I help you read, Daddy?" "Not now, Janie. . . ." "But I can read, Daddy!" "Please, Janie . . . Martha! Martha, come in here and take Janie out to help you ... go with your mother, Janie." "Why not let her sit with you, Steve ... for a little while." "Isn't this Andy's night?" Martha Stephans abruptly turns away from her hus band and pushes Janie out of the room ahead of her. Mr. Stephans returns to his book. From the kitchen come sounds of rattling dishes and Janie's muffled whimpers, but Mary was never like that when she was younger. Mary was a quiet girl who always knew her place, but the virility of horses is extinguished when their manes are cut, and it's snowing outside. She was buried in the snow. Indeed, we read of a horse having lived to be seventy years of age. He can hear the back kitchen door open. Then he saw her at the bottom of the ice. He shout ed but she couldn't hear. He had an ax in his hand, "Hello, Martha ... and little Janie. . . ." "Don't call me little!" "Is ... is he home?" and he was lashing at the ice, but every time he swung down, the vibration cracked her bones, and we also find it noted that a horse called Opus went on copulating to the age of forty, and she tried to scream for him to stop, but she couldn't move her mouth; the blows of the ax were splitting her apart and faces were staring at her and someone was holding something damp on her forehead and she could hear the monotonous click-clack of the swaying train, the voices and the pain because his ewes used to conceive offspring corresponding to the reflect ed images of the rams which they saw mounting them from behind, in the mirror of the rivers in which they stood, "He's reading . . . don't bother him." "At least I should say hello." "No, Andy . . . just leave him alone." The lower part of her body felt stiff and numb and frozen ... it must have felt that way . . . and Martha looked down at herself and saw the blood trickling down her legs, the ugly lump of red flesh still-born, she was screaming, and Stephan wasn't there when they buried Mary in the snow by the railroad tracks, and this is why people tell pregnant women not to look any of the very disgusting animals in the face ? like dog-headed apes or monkeys or twisted monsters like himself ? lest they should give birth to children simi lar in appearance to those they met; but although she never lived, Mary is still alive. "Hey, Steve . . . how you doing, man? Still teach ing all that medieval stuff to those young girls?" "Don't bother him, Andy. . . ." "He won't let me read, Uncle Andy." "Here Janie . . . sorry to bother you, Steve. . . ." Mary would grow up among the shadows of small town apartments. Before Janie was born, Mary lived with her grandmother while Martha worked in Rus sell's Diner; but if the lion should happen to be pur sued by hunting men, the smell of the hunters reaches up to him, and he disguises his spoor behind him with his tail, "Is he going to stay here all night?" "It's his house." "I can't understand a man. . . ." "Don't try . . . and speak softer ... he might hear you." Thus the sportsman cannot track him. Mary's grand mother was a tyrannical old bitch who demanded ab solute obedience from Mary because of Martha's in discretions. Her grandmother would take her to church and make her sit up straight, and if Mary moved, her grandmother would pinch her, "I still don't like it." "But he doesn't care . . . I've told you that." "Who doesn't care, Mommy?" When the minister refused to baptize the memory of the dead infant, Mary's grandmother hobbled through the rooms of her apartment, half-muttering and sob bing to herself. Mary would learn to stay back in the shadows and not get in the way, "Hush, Janie." It D by Charles Aukema CHARLES AUKEMA is working on a novel based on a computer model. Tie has a story in the current Intro $i published this fall by Bantam Books. 26 The North American Review</page><page sequence="2">was in this way that our Savior (i.e. the Spiritual Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the Rod of Jesse, (James?) the Lord of Lords, the son of God) once hid the spoor of his love in the high places, until, being sent by the Father, he came down into the womb of the Virgin Mary and saved the human race which had perished; but that was three years after Mary was dead. When he came back to marry her, she was eight months preg nant. After Janie was born he never slept with her because when a lioness gives birth to her cubs, she brings them forth dead and lays them up lifeless for three days?until their father, coming on the third day, breathes in their faces and makes them alive . . . and he came back to late to save Mary, and Janie wasn't his, so how could he give her life? "Want some coffee, Andy?" "I wanna read, Mommy!" "Sure . . . got a book, Janie?" "Daddy's got it." When Janie was small and Martha had to take care of her, Mary loved her mother. Martha would show Mary and Janie how to play dolls. While Martha dust ed the furniture and sang along with the radio and sometimes danced in the living rom, Mary would take care of Janie and hum "Jesus Loves Me, This I know" while she taught Janie how to stay inside the lines of the figures in the coloring book; but a sick lion searches for a monkey to eat, by which means he can be cured. Martha would teach Mary how to dress, how to cook, how to keep the house clean; but a lion fears a white cock, especially a white one. Mary would play on the light edge of shadows. "Can you read a newspaper, Janie?" "Sometimes . . . When Daddy listens." Although he is king of the beasts, a lion gets har rassed by the tiny sting of a scorpion, and snake poison kills him. He likes to bring his friends to the house. Andy, the junk dealer with a master's degree in Business Administration, comes over for dinner a lot, and Mary hates him; but leopards are born from the adultery of a lioness with a Pard, which produces this third kind of animal. His stomach hangs three inches over his belt and he's always chewing on a short fat cigar butt he likes to call his 'dog turd.' The Panther's only enemy is the Dragon. His fingernails are always embedded with grease and dirt and he smells like that piece of decaying pork her mother found in the pantry behind the can of Crisco, "Time for bed, Janie." "Not yet, Mommy ... I haven't read yet." "Tomorrow, Janie." "I'll tuck you in, Janie." Whenever he came over for dinner, Mary would refuse to eat anything. When he came to the house when her father was away. Mary would hide in the closet among her father's clothes until Andy left. Dying, the Panther reposed in the den-tomb and descended into Hell, there binding the Great Dragon. In this connection it may be mentioned as a singular coinci dence that, according to an ancient tradition, the real father of Jesus was a Roman soldier named Panthera. Yet Bucky, the mechanic at the Ford garage, was dif ferent. She liked Bucky. He had blonde hair and blue eyes like Janie, and whenever he came over, he always brought her a piece of sticky candy and then told her to go outside and play. The Panther has babies once. Harry frightens her. Dr. Ansell Robin states that unicorns may be captured by making them run their horns into trees, behind which the huntsman has dodg ed. "Kiss me good night, Uncle Andy?" Harry was very big, like a gingerman in a box of meringue kisses, and whenever he came, he would swoop her up in his huge hairy arms, throw her up in the air, and then catch her; and although Shakespeare generally gives the impression of having been a universal genius who knew everything, it is evident that he had never read a Bestiary. "Do you want a big fat sloppy one or would you prefer a small skinny one?" "Coffee's ready." "A big fat sloppy one, but no fair making noise." With his massive hands he would rumple her hair, spank her lightly, and then tell her to leave the room; yet it is astonishing that Aldrovandus does not describe any animal under any of these names, in all the 78 lb. 4 oz. avoirdupois, which is the exact weight of erudi tion presented by his eleven tomes ? the creature was probably an elk, eland, or reindeer ? she hated him. "Are you ready?" She wished that her mother would leave her at grandmother's where she had left Janie when Harry came; but the great naturalist had confused himself about these species, under the names of Tragelaphus, Tarandus, Rangiferus, Alee and Al cida inter alia. The souids that came from her moth er's bedroom when Harry was there tomented her be cause her mother would scream and laugh, and one day she screamed, "You leave her alone!" "Another one, Uncle Andy." "Only one a night, Janie." "I won't go to sleep, then. . . ." A unicorn is a very small animal like a kid, exces sively swift, with one horn in the middle of his fore head, and no hunter can catch him; but she heard Har ry's footsteps coming out of her mother's bedroom, and desperate, she tried to hide in the closet among the folds of her father's old, moth-eaten overcoat, "Andy . . .?" but he reached into the closet and pulled her out. "Don't go yet . . . you didn't read me a story." September-October 1968 27</page><page sequence="3">"Next time, Janie ... off to sleep, now." He tried to rock her in his arms to comfort her. He took out his handkerchief and tried to dry her eyes; but a unicorn can only be trapped by the following stratagem. When he tried to kiss her forehead, she sank her teeth into his cheek, and he hit the back of her head sharply, and that loosened her, "Is she asleep?" A virgin girl is led to where he lurks, and there she is sent off into the woods by herself. He soon leaps into her lap when he sees her, pushes his way inside her, and hence he gets caught. "Not yet." "Mommy!?" After Harry left her mother tried to console her, but she wouldn't listen. She wanted to tell her father about how Harry hit her and about how her mother had lock ed her in the closet, "Mommy!" The unicorn often fights with elephants and conquers them by wounding them in the belly. Mary screamed and cried and pound ed on the floor with her tiny fists until she slumped to the floor exhausted. Then she crawled to the back of the closet, reached up, and pulled her mother's old se quined party dress down from its hangers so that it fell on top of her, "That goddam kid." "I want Daddy to kiss me good-night, Mommy." "She needs a spanking." "Just drink your coffee, Andy . . . she'll go to sleep." Mary crouched underneath the dress, terrified that she would die hidden in the closet with the old clothes and the musty smell. The griffin is a winged quadru ped. As she would suffocate on dead air and decay like the pork in the pantry, the dress would sink low er and lower to the floor until it would cover just the skeleton of her praying. This kind of animal is born in Hyperborean parts, or in mountains. A griffin is something of a Hierglyphin, "Mommy! I've got to go to the bathroom." The griffin, however, was a serious animal and a more terrible one than the mysterious Dodo or Beddoes, "Go to sleep, Janie." Now she would rather be a sequin on her mother's party dress, or a button on her father's overcoat; but not this imaginary creation of her father's. It does not pay to be super cilious about the creatures in a Bestiary; her mother opened the door and pulled her out of the closet and slopped her across the face and then threw her back in the closet, "Mommy!!!" "Might as well humor her, Martha." Mary would have loved her father because he would have loved her. He took her to museums and he read her stories and he bought her dolls and clothes; but the griffin will also tear to pieces any human beings which it happens to come across, "Are you okay, Janie? Do you need anything else?" He had thousands and thousands of pictures of his young daughter; and whenever he had a vacation, he took her on long trips so she could see new places and learn new ideas . . . and they had a secret language that only they under stood, "I don't want to go to sleep, Mommy . . . I'm afraid_" "What are you afraid of, Janie?" "I'm afraid of Daddy." Mary trusted him, and when grownups were around, she stayed out of the way and took care of Janie, and there's an animal called an Elephant, which has no desire to copulate, "There's nothing to be afraid of, Janie." Mary would go over to the crib and sooth Janie's blonde curls. Janie had scribbled all over the wallpaper with a black crayon, and Mary would have to clean the color off. "But he doesn't like me, Mommy." "Of course he does ... he loves you, Janie." "Then why doesn't he kiss me good night?" The copulation of elephants was a matter for specu lation in the dark ages. Mary would go into the bath room, fill the pail half-full of cold water, sprinkle in some Old Dutch Cleanser, go back to her sister's room, and scrub the wall all night until everyone went home. "Why doesn't he kiss me good night, Mommy?" Solinus quotes Pliny to the effect that their genitals, like those mentioned by Sir Thomas Browne in his note on hares, were put on backward. "Hey, Martha, it's getting late." Now she would want to one of Janie's dolls or one of her coloring books. Or one of her blonde curls. "Just a minute, Andy . . . Janie, please go to sleep." It was supposed that, being modest, they preferred to look the other way while they were about it; but Janie was giggling or else Janie was gritting her teeth and clenching her tiny fists or else Janie was biting the pillow and kicking her small legs in the air. 28 The North American Review</page><page sequence="4">Janie is crying. And Mary would lean over the crib and hum a lul laby and stroke her blonde hair, "I'll ask your father, Janie." Yet Albertus held that they copulated like other quadrupeds, but that, owing to the great weight of the husband, he either had to dig a pit for his wife to stand in or else he had to float himself over her in a lake, where his gravity would naturally be less; but only in dreams could Mary love and worship her fath er and pray with her mother below the holy pictures and play dolls with Janie on the living room floor, "Can't you shut the kid up?" Elephants live three hundred years. "I'm trying, Andy, please. . . ." They possess vast intelligence and memory, but in dreams she was always on a train running from car to car trying to catch her father who for a moment stood smiling in the doorway at the other end of the car and then slowly receded into the next car and the next car because the train was endless, and she was trying to catch her father, but in every seat, in every car, she saw her mother slumped back in the seat (or was it in the bathroom?) her eyes closed, her mouth gasping for air, her skirt torn off, her blood-spattered legs open wide, and Mary was a red quivering lump of flesh slipping to the floor, and she was trying to catch a glimpse of her father and the faceless blonde haired conductor who was holding a blonde-haired baby girl in his arms while it was snowing, and she was chasing her father down the train until she woke up and froze, "Excuse me, Steve. . . ." School would begin tomorrow. "Can I talk to you for a minute?" If one of them wants a baby, he goes eastward to wards Paradise, and there is a tree there called Mand ragora, "It's about Janie. . . ." Mandrake. Her mother said she would like school; but there is still a genus of planks called the Mandragora, said to be emetic, narcotic, and 'fertilizing'. "She wants you to kiss her good night, Stephan," but the mandrakes which Ruben found were used by his mother Leah for venereal pur poses, "That's all you have to do, Stephan." The Greeks spoke of them as anthropomorphic, "Just this once, Stephan," and according to popular superstition they spring from human sperm spilled on the ground, "Please, Stephan, she loves you . . . please don't make her suffer because of me," and are so full of animal life and consciousness that they shriek when torn out of the earth, "She needs a father, Steve," and Mary is dead, so that 'living mortals, hearing them, run mad, "I'm sorry if I bothered you." And he goes with his wife. "I try, Steve, but you don't give me a chance." Locked in by her father and locked out by her moth er, she would have found herself in objects. "Are you coming or not?" Mary would have been a sequin or a button or a book or a doll or a coloring book or a blonde curl. "Then stay with your old senile books . . . you blood-sucking bastard ... it it wasn't for Janie. ..." She first takes of the tree and then gives some to her spouse. When they munch it up, it seduces them, and she immediately conceives in her womb, "Is he coming, Mommy?" "Later, Janie . . . after you go to sleep, he'll kiss you." "Did he promise? Did you get him to promise?" Mary could have been so many things. The leather chair. A wine bottle filled with colored water. A birthday candle. The sugar bowl. A page marker, "He promised . . . now to go to sleep like a good girl ... did you say your prayers?" The glasses out of which they drank hot chocolate milk in winter. There is an animal called Castor, none more gentle, and his testicles make a capital medicine. For this reason, so Psyiologus says, when he notices that he is being pur sued by a hunter, he removes his own testicles with a bite, and casts them before the sportsman, and thus escapes by flight. "Is she asleep?" "She'll be asleep soon." "What did Stephan say?" "Nothing ... as usual." But Mary would have to go to school. With her mother's looks and her father's mind, she would have been a beautiful and intelligent little girl. "What's he reading?" There is an animal called the Yena, which is accustomed to live in the sepulchres of the dead and to devour their bodies. She would dress carefully, she would study diligently, and all her classmates would hate her. When she was in the first grade she would want to be the ribbon in her glossy black hair; but then the boy in back of her snatched it out of her pigtail and put in her mouth, "Some stupid thing about ani mals." "Do you think it's safe, now?" "Not yet. . . Janie's still awake." Its nature is that at one moment it is masculine and at another moment feminine, and hence it is a dirty brute; but they wouldn't bother her too much until she was older. When she was in the fifth grade, the boy in back of her would cut off the tip of one of her pig tails, and it copies the sound of human vomiting. She did not cry. Such dogs as it calls out like this, it gobbles up with hypocritical sobs. She would put a scarf over her head and hurry home so that no one would see her, not even the two dark figures who walked ahead of her every day after school before she turned off her street, the street just before the railroad tracks and Butler's Alley. Safe inside the house, she would walk quickly to the bathroom, take the scarf off, pick up the scis sors, and carefully trim the other pigtail. "What are you doing?" Martha asked. "Nothing," Mary would say. "It's okay, Martha, she's asleep." "You know . . . sometimes I think I'll go crazy." "Because of him, Martha . . . not us." Mary is bathing in cold water; and if by chance the sporting dogs should cross its shadow while they are hunting it, they lose their voices and can't give tongue, "Can he hear us?" When she was in the sixth grade, another boy would touch her, she would slap him, September-October 1968 29</page><page sequence="5">and when she refused to tell the principal what hap pened, he would send her home with a note to her mother, "I don't care what he can hear . . . just be careful of Janie." "What time is it?" "About ten-thirty." That the sudden sight of a man-eater causes ob mutency need be no fable. While Mary was walking home in the snow, she would be so fascinated by the falling flakes of snow that she would not hear the foot steps behind her until they stopped on either side of her. Artemidorus the grammarian, Burton informs us, lost his wits by the unexpected sight of a crocodile, "Hurry up, Martha, I'm cold." She would be watching their white faces and thin lips and blue eyes and the white steam coming from their nostrils when they talk ed. The viper is called this because it brings forth in violence. Mary would shiver slightly. Back and forth, back and forth Mary would float in dry water of scalding snow. The bedroom. His wife is a good woman. Hurt of Sedici?n. He stands in front of the bedroom door, Janie, but her bones would melt away, Mary, and she would be a red sticky blob of wax floating in blood-red water, Martha pushed and pulled back by cold hands that would not let her sink, Janie, as the tall one grunted in front of her, the high whining laughter behind her, Heptameron, Janie. He is married to Martha, but Janie is not his daughter. His daughter is dead, aren't you Mary? Miscarried, mis placed, misinterpreted, Miscellanies, Pseudoxia Epi d?mica. Vortigern and Rowena. The noises. He crouches down to the keyhole and looks inside the room, but he can see nothing. AU the lights have gone out, Gorboduc. No more falling stars. She would feel him clawing and scratching out her in sides, and then he would vomit inside her, balm in Gilead, Janie, and then they would drop her back on the floor where she would shiver in the cold wind coming underneath the door of the bedroom, a snow ball rolled up in blood and Martha, the second man (was he a gas station attendant at the Ford garage? A high school boy who dropped out of school because he had on obsession for grease and oil?), the repitition He stands up and moves into the kitchen . . . slashed down the middle, cracked like an ice cube, churned around and around, side to side, back and forth, up and down, her head twisted on the concrete floor while a high whining moon mixed with squeals and slobbering sounds like fingernails scratched across frost on a win dowpane in Janie's room, and it's snowing outside, and she died nine yeas ago. Tonight, Martha. His wife is a good woman. He sits down at the kitchen table, but then stands up again and walks into Janie's room, remember? Mary is alone now. Silence and the cold. Nothing moves. Janie is asleep. Her face would scrape against the floor while she breathed. He looks down at her, and Martha. Her legs numb and lifeless. Her arms broken and helpless. The middle of her body would jerk spasmodically, so he reaches down and picks her up, and she would vomit, Martha, so he puts his hand over her mouth, and Mary would know that she was dead, she would want to be home. With the snow. And the railroad tracks. The window. Janie struggles slightly, then relaxes. A train whistle echoes in the distance, but Martha's in the bedrom, she can't hear because she's frozen be neath the ice and he's skating on top of her with an other woman he holds in his arms, and it's snowing outside, Mary was buried in the snow. He walks over to the window, and while Janie snuggles sleepily against him, her face buried in his shoulder, her arms wrap ped around his neck, and Martha, Mary begins to crawl toward the back door of the shed because she wants to be part of the train load of animals. He opens the window in order to hear the train go past her croaching in the snow. He leans out the window in order to hear the train go past her crouching in the snow. He leans out the window and holds Janie in front of him in order to let her hear the train go past her crouching in the snow that falls savagely, profanely, softly through his arms as train after train storms the night like snowflakes falling down like Mary falling and falling through drifts of memory, the cold snow falling down, now, gently, gently. "Have you been taking the pills?" Pointing at the shed on the other side of the rail road tracks, the short one would giggle while he grab bed her arm. The big one would take her other arm, and shivering, she would hear their hurried breathing, their fingers trembling on her arms as they neared the shed, "Don't worry about it." "Whattaya mean, don't worry? Christ, Martha. . . ." "You don't have to worry. . . ." The reason is that when its belly is yearning for de livery, the young snakes, not waiting for the timely discharge of birth, gnaw through the mother's sides and burst out to her destruction, "Don't come to me when it happens again." The wind was whipping around her ankles. A car was coming down the snow filled road. "Stephan's in the next room." "To hell with Steve, it's you I'm worried about." When her father came around the bend of the corn er in front of them, Mary would dart away from them, run to the back of the shed, and leave them standing in the middle of the road, "Let's stop arguing . . . we don't have all night." "Get in bed, then." It is said, moreover, that the male puts his head in the female's mouth and spits the semen into it. In the back of the shed she would see a large snowdrift, and she would crawl into the snow, cover herself, and crouch silently under snow, wanting to be cold, "Not so quickly," and she would hear her father's car dis appearing in the distance, and then a hand reached down and grabbed her by the hair and pulled her roughly from beneath the snow. Then she, angered by his lust, bites off his head when he tries to take it off again. They would drag her inside the shed and 30 The North American Review</page><page sequence="6">then stuff a red snot-filled handkerchief in her mouth, and she would gag and try to spit it out, but the short one would stuff it in harder, "Okay, now?" Thus both parents perish, the male when he copulates, the fe male when she gives birth. He closes the book while they held her off the ground and the sound of bedsprings, coffee. Shivering cold, she would want to be colder, "Don't be so anxious," a cigarette. Her muscles and stomach would tighten, matches, and she would shiver tense and still, "That's better . . . fine," tomorrow's lecture . . . revenge plays. . . . She would want to be something solid. He puts the book on the coffee table in front of him, muffled whispers, she would see the dead frozen bird on the concrete floor, and she wanted to be some thing solid, but the hands were tearing away the un derclothes and windows, the bathtub, a cigarette. "I love you," the tall one unbuttoning himself, the short one holding her.
