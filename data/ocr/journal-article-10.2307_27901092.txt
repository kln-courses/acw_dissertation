<plain_text><page sequence="1">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Ar THE present time there is much need of a good, up l \ to date, bibliography of historical studies in philoso phy. An annual publication of a complete and critical bib liography of such studies as have appeared during the year would render a real service to scholars in this field. But, let it be understood, it is with no pretension to anything even approximating a complete reporting of publications that the following few pages are written. The aim of this brief survey is merely to give some indication, necessarily incomplete, of the nature and extent of the contributions which British and American scholars are making toward our better understanding and appreciation of the philoso phers of the past. Having this end in view, we deliberately and with a certain recognized arbitrariness confine our consideration to some of the books on the history of philos ophy, written in English, that have appeared during the last ten years. In the whole of English philosophical liter ature, one finds very few comprehensive histories of phil osophy-works of the allgemeine Geschichte variety which may be either pointed to with pride or viewed with alarm. "English writers have as a rule been most reluc tant to produce histories of philosophy. They appear to be overwhelmed by a sense of the enormous difficulty of the task and of the awful dignity of the muse who presides over this form of composition."1 But partial histories, deal ing with some aspect or period of the whole, are more numerous ; and it will be well, perhaps, to notice first a few 1 Mr. Alan Dorward, in Mind, N. S. 32 (1923), p. 501.</page><page sequence="2">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 679 of the works of this order that have been published during the last decade. I. "Histories" of Philosophy: Mention may be made first of two rather unpretentious works dealing with the philosophy of France. ( 1 ) Mr. J. A. Gunn has surveyed the movements of French thought since the middle of the nineteenth century in his Modern French Philosophy: A Study of the Development Since Comte.2 Three main cur rents of thought are therein distinguished-the positivist, the neo-critical, and the spiritualistic-and traced through their divergent treatments of the problems of the age, un der the none too definite captions of Science, Freedom, Progress, Ethics, and Religion. The method of historiog raphy here employed, which subordinates the individual thinker to the treatment of general problems, is beset with difficulties-as M. Bergson recognized in his "foreword" to the volume; few have followed with any complete suc cess the illustrious example of Windelband here. But Mr. Gunn's exposition-he disclaims any attempt at critical evaluation-affords in the main a lucid and instructive rep resentation of French philosophy of the period since 1850. (2) Supplementing the preceding in several ways is a more recent volume by Mr. George Boas, discussing the first half of the century under the title^ French Philosophies of the Romantic Period.3 "The importance of a philosopher," writes the author (p. 307), "is not to be measured by the number of pages which he receives in a history of philoso phy" [sic!] . . . but "is to be measured by the intimacy which he has with the civilization in which he works; by the effect he has upon that civilization or by the clearness with which he expresses that civilization's interests." Mr. Boas is concerned simply with "making the proper corre lations" between the political and aesthetic developments in the age following the Revolution and its philosophies. 2 New York, Dodd, Mead and Co., 1922. 3 Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press, 1925.</page><page sequence="3">68o THE MONIST Whatever one may think of the statement that "Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus had relatively little contact with their times" (or of its implications as regards their "impor tance"), one may still admit that, judged by the author's standard, the French thinkers with whom he deals "take on a striking importance." Fields hitherto little familiar to English and American students have been cultivated advantageously in two schol arly works next to be noted. In A History of Mediaeval Jewish Philosophy/ Mr. Isaac Husik has done an admir able pioneer work. By "Jewish philosophy" the author here designates not the entire philosophical activity of the Jews during the middle ages, but rather-excluding mys ticism and Kabbala-their rationalistic philosophy, whose task was primarily the "reconciling of two apparently inde pendent sources of truth": "The Bible and Talmud were the documents of revelation, Aristotle was the document of reason" (Preface). (Is it not, then, rather a conse quence of definition than a statement of historical fact that "Jewish philosophy never passed beyond the scholastic stage. . . . There are Jews now and there are philoso phers, but there are no Jewish philosophers and there is no Jewish philosophy" [p. 431] ?) Through eighteen sub stantial chapters, whose content is systematically ordered and clearly presented, Mr. Husik traces "the rationalistic movement in mediaeval Jewry from its beginnings in the ninth and tenth centuries in Babylon among the Karaites and Rabbanites to its decline in Spain and south France in the fifteenth century" (p. 428). Only those scholars who have intelligent access to the Hebrew literature of the period can pass judgment upon the accuracy of the author's interpretations. But it may be said that the work should have a generous measure of success in its avowed aim of appealing both "to the scholar and the intelligent 4 New York, Macmillan Co., 1916.</page><page sequence="4">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 681 non-technical reader"; appealing to the former certainly by its copious citation of sources in the notes, well rele gated to an appendix, and appealing to the latter by its simple directness of statement and logically ordered expo sitions. Professor Surendranath Dasgupta has published the first volume of his History of Indian Philosophy? which will be completed in two volumes. Because Sanskrit and Pali sources of Hindu thought are inaccessible to most English and American students, this work by a recognized Sanskrit scholar is of considerable interest and importance. In its plan the book differs strikingly from any history of western philosophy; the difference is-as the author ex plains-necessitated by the nature of the subject itself. For in the evolution of Hindu philosophy one finds not a suc cession of one system or type of philosophy upon another which it tends to replace, but rather a parallel development of a limited number of rival systems. "Instead of produc ing a succession of free-lance thinkers having their own systems to propound and establish," writes the author (p. 63), "India had brought forth schools of pupils who car ried the traditionary views of particular systems from gen eration to generation, who explained and expounded them, and defended them against the attacks of rival schools." "The Hindus classify the systems of philosophy into two classes, namely, the nastika and the astika. The nastika . . . views are those which neither regard the Vedas as infallible nor try to establish their own validity on their authority. These are principally three in number, the Bud dhist, Jaina and the Carvaka. The astika-mata or ortho dox schools are six in number, Samkhya, Yoga, Vedanta, Mimamsa, Nyaya and Vaisesika, generally known as the six systems" (p. 68). Dasgupta asserts (p. 8) that "the earliest beginnings of most systems of Hindu thought can a Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1922.</page><page sequence="5">682 THE MONIST be traced to sometime between 600 B. C. to 100 or 200 B. C. As time went on the systems began to develop side by side. Most of them were taught from the time in which they were first conceived to about the seventeenth century A. D. in an unbroken chain of teachers and pupils." Each of the successive chapters in this first volume of the History deals with one of these systems in its evolution throughout the whole of this long period. Of the evolution in general, Dasgupta writes (p. 64) : "A system in the sutras is weak and shapeless as a newborn babe, but if we take it along with its developments down to the beginning of the seven teenth century it appears as a fully developed man strong and harmonious in all its limbs. It is therefore not pos sible to write any history of successive philosophies of India, but it is necessary that each system should be studied and interpreted in all the growth it has acquired through the successive ages of history from its conflicts with the rival systems as one whole." No one but a Sanskrit scholar could possibly judge the accuracy with which these Indian systems are interpreted; but every reader can appreciate the remarkable lucidity of Professor Dasgupta's style, no less than the learning that has entered into the production of this work for which the need is unquestioned. Mr. W. R. Sorley's one volume History of English Phil osophy* was designed "to trace the history of philosophy in Great Britain from the time when it began to be written in the English language"-with Bacon's Advancement of Learning (1605)-"until the end of the Victorian era" (Preface). It is based upon the chapters earlier contrib uted by Mr. Sorley to the Cambridge History of English Literature; thus, in its conception at least, it really ante dates Mr. James Seth's study of English Philosophers and Schools of Philosophy1 with which it naturally invites com Ibid., 1920. 7 London, J. M. Dent and Sons, Ltd., 1912. In the "Channels of English Literature" Series.</page><page sequence="6">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 683 parison. Both authors seek to delineate the British national philosophy as its traits are exhibited in the succession of thinkers who have given it shape.8 Neither of these works, however, seems essentially to modify traditional interpre tations of the leading British philosophers, although Mr. Sorley has, in particular, well insisted upon keeping intact the whole outlook of the individual thinkers, as against the procedure which views them merely as examples of "empiricism," "realism," "materialism," or some other "ism." A special service rendered by this work-not, how ever, in a greater degree than by Mr. Seth's volume-is the attention it gives to the literary, as well as the doc trinal, significance of English philosophers. The estimate of Mr. Sorley's work expressed by a scholarly English re viewer seems, with its cautious restraint, eminently fair: "There is probably no other work from which the general student of good intelligence can learn so readily exactly what our philosophers have done to shape the general course of the stream of 'British thought' and to create its vehicle of expression."9 Mr. Seth commenting, in 1912, upon the "confluence of the two streams of English and American philosophy" prophesied that "in the future, the movement of philosophi cal thought in England and America will be a single move ment."10 And then, ten years later, came Mr. A. K. Rogers' interesting volume on English and American Philosophy Since 1800: A Critical Survey.11 The nineteenth century -even though we are now well beyond it-continues to present grave difficulties to the historian of its philosophy ; the more grave in proportion as he conceives the historian's task to involve a complete and orderly representation of 8 T. M. Forsythe's English Philosophy : A Study of Its Method and Gen eral Development (1910), cn account of its entirely different method, still fur nishes a most valuable supplement to these works.

Mr. Rogers disclaims any primarily historical purpose in writing this book, and disarms some possible criticism through his in sistence (in his Preface) that the "book as a whole is frankly propaganda, and designed to recommend one par ticular attitude as against conflicting attitudes." But if the book be propaganda, it is not obvious what special mes sage it definitely proclaims. Although the author's pri mary interest was not in "the tracing of historical affilia tions and historical causes," it is nevertheless likely that his success in his endeavor "as a historian to be accurate" in the expository portion of his task will remain one of the most permanent recommendations of the work. The vol ume is by far the most complete picture we yet have of the whole English-American philosophical family of the nine teenth century, comprising as it does not only all of the first rate, but most, perhaps, of the second and third rate minds as well. A good bibliography covering publications of the sort here being considered would quite certainly include several significant titles besides those of the six works that have been singled out for mention above. The compiler of such a bibliography would certainly not be so far led astray by titles as to omit the expanded and thoroughly revised sec ond edition of Mr. Ernest Barker's Greek Political Theory: Plato and His Predecessors.12 Professor A. E. Taylor's appraisal of that work seven years ago as "by far the best work yet in existence on the social and political side of Plato's philosophy"13 is likely to remain a fair one for sev eral years to come. Nor, further, would one fail to take cognizance of the real service that Mr. E. A. Burt has done all students of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by 12 London, Methuen and Co., 1918. 18 See his review of this work in Mind, N. S. 28 (1919).</page><page sequence="8">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 685 his work, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Phys ical Science: A Historical and Critical Essay.14 Perhaps nowhere-certainly in no single English work-can one find so illuminating a discussion of the philosophical aspects of the achievements of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Gilbert, Boyle, and Newton. The book is a distinct contribution to the history of philosophy. Finally, one would certainly not forget to include the posthumously published Lectures on Modern Idealism15 by Josiah Royce. For where can one find more of appreciative insight into the systems of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, or a more trustworthy and suggestive interpretation of that post-Kantian movement, than in those pages ? Royce often modestly disavowed the role of historian of philosophy. Nevertheless, he not only drew constantly and largely upon the wisdom of the past, but he often enough repaid his indebtednesses by shedding much of the illumination of the interpreter upon it. One of the most learned historians of Greek philosophy has recently proclaimed that, "No one will ever succeed in writing a history of philosophy."16 Many of us share Mr. Burnetts opinion, even when the grounds of our conviction may be not quite identical with his. Of course, such an opinion purports more than the platitudinous observation that no one can ever reasonably hope to write definitively the history of any, or all, periods ; that one's work may be improved upon by others who come after is not in itself to miss "success." Rather one who voices such an opinion has an eye not so much to the inevitable limitations of his torians of any one age as to a special difficulty in the very nature of the task itself. But what, after all, is the task of a historian of philosophy ? One more often meets with dis claimers of the title than with any thoughtful discussion of 14 New York, Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1925. 15 These ten lectures, originally delivered in 1906 at the Johns Hopkins University, were first published by the Yale University Press, New Haven, in 1919. 18 John Burnet : Greek Philosophy. Part I : Thales to Plato, p. 1.</page><page sequence="9">686 THE MONIST the task disavowed. This would not be the occasion to discuss the problem even if the present writer felt that he had any new light to shed upon it. But it does seem to him clear, and a matter of importance, that some o our prevailing discouragement and failure grows out of a con fused understanding of the task. At least let us ask: Is not the history of philosophy an enter prize that may be nay, ought to be-clearly distinguished, e. g., on the one hand from the history of philosophical writings and writ ers and on the other hand from the history of "thought," of "culture," of "civilization," or of something else-if such there be-even more vaguely inclusive? Of course, philosophy scarcely "exists" apart from writings and writ ers, nor out of relation to civilization ! Yet why must the historian of it compete creditably with the "Absolute"-or be a failure? Why should we in the field of philosophical history in particular rebel against the limitations of an inevitable abstraction? Or again (having limited our selves to philosophy), let us ask: Must we not clearly ob serve the distinction between the task, e. g., of purely de scriptive and interpretative exposition and the quite dif ferent task of tracing causes and influences of philoso phies ? And need a history of philosophy, in order to "suc ceed," perform both of these tasks? Indeed, would not success often lie rather nearer by the doing of one of these tasks adequately and consistently and without whimsically passing from one to the other? But, after all, Professor Burnet's prophecy of an eternal shortcoming rests upon rather different reflections. He wisely observes that "phil osophies, like works of art, are intensely personal things; and thence passes on to the more questionable proposition that it is only "in so far as the historian can reproduce the Platonic contact of souls that his work will have value." Perhaps the fact of the matter is that, to be a good his torian of philosophy one must needs be so much of a philos</page><page sequence="10">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 687 opher that the ubiquitous problem of the one and the many is apt to lay rather too burdensome a hand upon him qua historian. At least it seems to the present writer that it is in the interpretation of the "many" individual philoso phies, rather than in the exhibition of the "one" through the continuous unfolding of successive philosophies, that English and American scholarship has chiefly furthered the history of philosophy. And we may now turn to some works which will serve to illustrate this service. 2. Studies of Individual Ancient Greek Thinkers: The philosophical literature of the twentieth century displays marked evidences of an increased interest in Greek philoso phy, and perhaps in Platonism in particular. Students of the history of Greek thought are vastly indebted to Eng lish scholars in this field, notably to Mr. John Burnet and Mr. A. E. Taylor. Such students appreciate especially the vast learning and substantial scholarship, no less than the freshness of vision, which these men have brought to bear upon the vexed questions centering around the inter pretation of the Platonic Dialogues; even while many are not ready to accept the whole of their positive results. Per haps, among others, the problem of the "historic" Socrates is destined to remain a perennial one ; it is certainly not the less apt to do so long as philosophical students feel satis fied in the assurance that, however historians of any gen eration may "solve" it, the thought of Plato's Dialogues is a secured possession forever. Yet, as Mr. Burnet sim ply observes, 'Tn a way, no doubt, it does not matter whether we owe a truth to Pythagoras or Socrates or Plato but it is natural for us to desire to know our benefactors and keep them in grateful remembrance."17 And what historian, having any scruples of conscience about his "evi dences," after encountering all that prodigious progeny of unscientific methods, the bewildering number of "real" 17 The Socratic Doctrine of the Soul, p. 3. Italics my own.</page><page sequence="11">688 THE MONIST Socrates'es, will not feel the force of Mr. Burnet's remark: "It would be better to say at once that we cannot know any thing about Socrates, and that for us he must remain a mere x. Even so, however, the Platonic Socrates is actual enough."18 Of course, the revolutionizing labors of both Burnet and Taylor mostly antedate the period of the last ten years which is here being considered. But we should note in pass ing the continuation of their work. Particular attention should be called to the important address of Mr. Burnet on The Socratic Doctrine of the Soul19 as well as to his recent edition of Plato's Euthyphro, Apology of Socrates, and Crito,20 whose notes (like those of the earlier edition of the Phaedo) richly abound in suggestive information, access ible even to the reader of English with no Greek. And all teachers and students of philosophy who have marvelled at the excellence of Mr. A. E. Taylor's little volume on Plato21 may now find, furnished by his latest study of Platonism and Its Influence22 a fresh illustration of how much a master of the subject can achieve with great brevity and simplicity. In this latest work the arrangement of the three chapters on the "Principles of Science," the "Rule of Life," and "Plato the Theologian" is reminiscent of the earlier volume; but this later study is occupied with the tradition and influence of Plato under these three heads. Assuredly the fulfillment of this little book is far beyond the author's modest claim (in his Preface) "not so much to supply information as to provoke the desire for it." The information supplied is very considerable; and the excel i Greek Philosophy, p. 128. 10 The second annual "Henriette Hertz Lecture on a Master Mind," deliv ered Jan. 25, 1916, and published for the British Academy by the Oxford Uni versity Press. 20 Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1924. 21 London and New York, 1911.

In "Our Debt to Greece and Rome" series.</page><page sequence="12">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 689 lently selected bibliography indicates where the best of fur ther sources of information lie. Students of Greek thought will find much value in three pleasingly written volumes by Mr. Paul Elmer More. Platonism,23 the earliest of these, now stands as a sort of in troduction to a series which will be complete in four vol umes on The Greek Tradition : From the Death of Socrates to the Council of Chalcedon, of which the first two have so far appeared, viz., The Religion of Plato2* and Hellenistic Essays.25 Mr. More appears to accept in general-although it does not fall within the scope of his work to discuss the problems involved-the accuracy of Plato's picture of Socrates: "the biographical parts of the Apology, Crito, and Phaedo present a faithful picture of the man Socra tes" ; and he adds, "It is easier to believe in the power of Nature to create such a character than in the ability of an author to imagine it."26 In his interpretation of Platonism, this scholar lays much emphasis on its "dualism"; not only -what is recognized by all-the dualism revealed within the soul especially through the moral consciousness, but a supposedly ultimate metaphysical dualism. It was this dual ism, according to Mr. More, which the later Hellenistic philosophies sought to escape, and which early orthodox Christianity alone retained, thereby becoming the true in heritor of Plato's teaching. It is Mr. More's ambition in these volumes to interpret the thought tradition which re ceived its initial impulse from Socrates, was developed by Plato, and-despite its perversion in Stoicism and neo Platonism-entered into Christianity. Of this tradition, "Platonic and Christian at the center," he writes : "With out it, so far as I can see, we should have remained bar 23 Princeton University Press, 1917.

Plotinus29 is a conspicuous instance of a great figure in the history of thought who has not hitherto received, in the English literature, the studious attention that is his due. By two volumes on The Philosophy of PlotinusT the schol arly Dean of St. Paul's-long recognized as a master among the mystics-has made a noteworthy contribution to historical studies. Dr. Inge confesses himself "to be a disciple and not merely a student and critic of the philoso pher" whom for many years he has studied "as a spiritual director, a prophet and not only a thinker." But his most enlightening exposition of Plotinian mysticism is not ren dered the less accurate or impartial, it would appear, by Dr. Inge'? deeply-felt conviction that Plotinus is "full of intellectual light and guidance" and that we may today well "find in him a message of calm and confidence for the troublous time through which we are passing." Four lec tures on "The Third Century" and "The Forerunners of Plotinus" constitute a well done introduction to the detailed exposition of the system, which is the main achievement of the work. The present writer would not venture his own 27 The Religion of Plato, Preface, p. viii. 28 This statement in the "Preface" to Platonism seems to be equally applic able to the subsequent volumes. 29 The Complete Works of Plotinus have recently been translated into Eng lish by K. S. Guthrie (Alpine, N. J., Comparatve Literature Press, 1918). See also the translation of the first four Enneads by Stephen MacKenna (London, P. L. Warner, 1917). 30 London, Longmans, Green and Co., 1918.</page><page sequence="14">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 69I judgment as to the accuracy, in several details, of this in terpretation of the Enneads31 But he must confess that the later lectures, dealing with the practical aspects of the philosophy-rather than those dealing with the metaphys ics-have seemed to bring him much light in a field that has always seemed one of the most inhospitable toward his efiforts at understanding. As an acquaintance with the Greek language becomes less and less a part of the equipment of large numbers of philo sophical students, the greater is the significance attaching to such notable enterprizes of translation as that sponsored by the University of Oxford in the case of Aristotle's com plete works. One of the first volumes of this translation to appear was the translation of the Metaphysics by Mr. W. D. Ross, one of the co-editors of the work. More re cently, we have the substantial volume by Mr. Ross entitled Aristotle32 a work of mature scholarship. Its aim is neither to trace Aristotle's ideas to their earlier origins, nor to fol low out their influence, but (as stated in the Preface) "sim ply to give an account of the main features of his philoso phy as it stands before us in his works." The content of the Aristotelian treatises is, in the main, lucidly summar ized in chapters dealing in order with the Logic, Philoso phy of Nature, Biology, Psychology, Metaphysics, Ethics, Politics, and Rhetoric and Poetics. How far such a method of exposition, which tries to lift its subject out of the stream of ideas in which his thought lived, is the way to the best understanding of a thinker, we shall not discuss. But the present writer misses in this book the exhibition, which he fondly hoped to find there, of a deep conviction-such as he knows Mr. Ross must feel-of the vitality and interest for our own day of some of Aristotle's problems and solu tions. This is not to suggest-what I am far from believ 31 One may see for competent criticism the review by A. E. Taylor in Mind, N. S. 2? (1919), pp. 238-245. 32 London, Methuen and Co., Ltd., 1923.</page><page sequence="15">692 THE MONIST ing-that the study of the great minds of the past need be justified by the light they may shed upon present-day prob lems. But as little does it appear to me that a great philo sophical system of the past need be distorted by being ex amined in the light of present day interests. It must be difficult, I should suppose, to write chapters on, e, g., Aris totle's biology or psychology with no references to the issues in contemporary philosophy of "mechanism and vitalism/' "emergent" and "creative" evolution, "function alism," "behaviorism," etc. But doubtless there are those to whom the seeming detachment of Mr. Ross's writing from present day concerns will seem the surest evidence of that objectivity which is always to be expected in the true historian. Certainly everyone will profit by the enor mous learning that has gone to the preparation of this compact volume.33 3. Studies of Modern European Philosophers : Neither English nor American writers have, during the last ten years, enriched our understanding of the philosophers of the seventeenth century through any works comparable, e. g., with those earlier ones of N. K. Smith on Descartes, of Sir Frederic Pollock and Joachim on Spinoza, or of Russell on Leibniz.34 But they have advanced considerably our knowledge of some British philosophers. This is conspicu ously true in the case of three meritorious volumes, next to be mentioned, dealing severally with the three classic rep resentatives of "English Empiricism." Each of these vol 83 Mr. A. E. Taylor's Aristotle (2nd ed., London and Edinburgh, 1919. In the series of "The People's Books,") is a small volume only in respect of the number CT its pages, and loses not at all by comparison with the much more detailed exposition by Ross. 34 This is not failing in appreciation of the book by Mr. Leon Roth on Descartes, Spinoza and Maimonides (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1924), with its fresh discussion of the old problem of the relation of Spinza's thought to its Cartesian and Jewish antecedents; or of his recent editing of the Corre spondence of Descartes and Constantyn Huygens, 1635-1647 (Oxford, Claren don Press, 1926). Nor do we overlook, e. g., the monograph by Mr. A. G. A. Balz on Idea and Essence in the Philosophies of Hobbes and Spinoza (New York, Columbia University Press, 1918) and other brief studies too numerous even to be listed here.</page><page sequence="16">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 693 umes strives to correct prevailing misconceptions about the motivations of these thinkers; and all protest against the one-sidedness of view which results when these philoso phers are looked upon merely as exponents of "empiri cism." The far reaching influence of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding upon subsequent philosophical his tory is universally recognized. But it may well be doubted whether this important document has ever received so fair or so masterly an interpretation as in Mr. James Gibson's Locke's Theory of Knowledge and Its Historical Rela tions.86 Mr. Gibson correctly observes (in his Preface) that the habit of regarding the movement in British philos ophy which culminated in Hume "as the story of the self refutation of certain of Locke's principles, has been largely responsible for the false perspective in which the Essay itself is too commonly viewed"; and he notes further (p. 182) that the fact that the Essay "constitutes the starting point of the classical development of philosophy in Eng land has led to concentration of attention upon its influence, to the comparative neglect of the sources from which it is derived." These limitations and defects in interpretation Mr. Gibson seeks to remedy. In "Part I" he sets forth "The Doctrine of the Essay" with a rare freedom from pre possessions about it. Insisting that the real motive of the work is epistemological, he observes (p. if.) that "any account of Locke's work which finds its main significance in an account of the genesis of our ideas fails entirely to represent either the aim or the outcome of the Essay, as these were conceived by its author. Great as was the im portance which he attached to his theory upon this subject, it played only a subordinate part in the scheme of the Essay as he designed it ; and any attempt to make it central alters entirely the perspective of the whole." How important it 35 Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1917.</page><page sequence="17">694 THE MONIST is for the interpreter of Locke to keep this point always in view becomes sufficiently clear in the excellent discussion of Locke's polemic against innate principles, the real point of which has often been missed. "Part II" discusses "The Historical Relations of Locke's Doctrine" most in structively. Especially helpful is the chapter treating of Locke's relations to his contemporaries-particularly his scientific contemporaries-in England. Professor Sorley in his History asserted (p. 104) that "John Locke may be regarded as, on the whole, the most important figure in English philosophy." Mr. Gibson, who cautiously refrains from evaluations of that sort and adheres strictly to his task of understanding Locke, has gone far in exhibiting the proofs for Mr. Sorley's statement. Second among the books on British philosophy we may mention Mr. G. A. Johnston's The Development of Berke ley's Philosophy.T The author is not sparing of superla tive estimates of his thinker: "Berkeley is naturally the keenest mind in the history of English philosophy" (p. 325), "perhaps the freshest and most original thinker in the history of British philosophy" (p. 12), and "Berkeley's literary style is the most delightful in the history of English philosophy" (p. 382). But despite such unrestraint, Mr. Johnston's work is on the whole a cautious and critical in vestigation of the evolution of Berkeley's theories. Espe cially good is the full and painstaking discussion in the chapter on the "Origins of Berkeley's Thought." As every interpreter must nowadays do, Mr. Johnston devotes much attention to the Commonplace Book, and gives a detailed and convincing discussion of the original order of its entries -with regard to which he dififers significantly from the view of Campbell Fraser. While the author recognizes that Berkeley's "philosophical activity was not only influ enced by the deist controversy, but was dominated by it," 36 London, Macmillan and Co., 1923.</page><page sequence="18">HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 695 he yet does not fall into the common error of supposing Berkeley's discovery of his central principle-esse est ant percipere ant percipi-to have been motivated by religious considerations, however much Berkeley welcomed what he later thought to be the agreement between his principle and religious orthodoxy. (It is not a little interesting to note that, instead of viewing the frequent avowals of orthodoxy in Berkeley's pages as exhibitions of the misplaced piety of an "Angelic" doctor, Johnston sees rather in them another instance of the practical sense of Berkeley whose eye was usually upon the "main chance" for ecclesiastical prefer ment ! Cf. Chapter VII on Berkeley's "Philosophy of Re ligion.") Among many suggestive points, scattered throughout the book, is a fine discussion (p. 2ogff.) of the way in which Berkeley's interest in the mathematician's employment of signs suggested his own metaphysical con ception ot signs. Two appendices to the volume discuss helpfully ( 1) the old question of Berkeley's relation to Col lier, and (2) the philosophy of John Sergeant, who, strangely neglected by historians, it would appear "merits study by all who are interested in the philosophy of Locke and Berkeley" (p. 396). In the third volume on British thinkers referred to above, Studies in the Philosophy of David Hunte*7 Mr. C. W. Hendel has made an extremely interesting contribution to our knowledge about one of the greatest figures in the his tory of modern philosophy. One could point to few, if indeed to any, studies of Hume in English literature which rival this in thoroughness and objectivity. Mr. Hendel corrects several current shallownesses of interpretation. E. g., Hume's critics have too often supposed that his dec laration that observation of the mind reveals only a "mere bundle or collection of perceptions" amounts to a denial of personal identity. This, however, is to neglect Hume's no 37 Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1923. Cf. the recent review by Mr. S. P. Lamprecht in the Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 22 (1926), pp. 411-418.</page><page sequence="19">696 THE MONIST less significant words to the effect that "the true idea of the human mind is to consider it as a system of different perceptions or existences. ... In this respect, I cannot compare the soul more properly to anything than to a re public ; . . . the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts." In his chapter on "The Self or Personal Iden tity," Mr. Hendel shows a very just understanding of Hume. Other examples there are a plenty in the book. But one of its most striking and novel features is its concern with the theological motivation and implications of Hume's thought. In 1915 Mr. Hendel undertook-for a doctor's dissertation-a study of Hume "in order to arrive at a clearer understanding of Hume's position with regard to religion." To Hume has commonly been attributed a hos tility toward religion and but a mild personal concern, at most, as to the truth of religious beliefs. Mr. Hendel urges quite convincingly that Hume's interest in "human nature" -especially his epistemological enquiries-was the direct outgrowth of an interest, reaching back to his early youth, in the theological problems of the day. He supposes also that the final outcome of Hume's lifelong reflections on religion was, in effect, to substitute a newer for an older standpoint of "naturalism" in religion-finding the basis which validates the belief in God's existence not in the evi dences of external nature but rather in the "natural imagi nation" of man. It does not fall within the scope of Mr. Hendel's book to treat, save quite incidentally, of the ethi cal writings of Hume. Recent years have witnessed the publication of two very notable volumes on the philosophy of Kant: A Commen tary to Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason"** by Mr. Norman Kemp Smith, and A Study of KantT by the late Mr. James 38 London, Macmillan and Co., 1918; second ed., 1923.

Were we bold-or foolish-enough to attempt an arrangement of the works mentioned in this survey accord ing to the order of their merit and distinction, certainly we should have to place these two works very near indeed to the head of our list. Mr. Smith's impressive scholarship and powers of interpretation in this Commentary defy any brief reporting of his achievement. The work is now known to all Kant students as skillfully combining the func tions of commenting with insight, and in order, upon the detailed passages of the Critique and of supplying a mas terly constructive interpretation of the whole work. The interpretations of Kant by English scholars have often suf fered from their Hegelian bias ; one of the traits of Smith's work, which was promptly upon its appearance recognized with approval, was that he did not look upon Kant's role in history as that of a John the Baptist to Hegel. The in compatible tendencies in the Critique are not glossed over, but receive close critical examination. In this matter the author has thoroughly availed himself of the more recently known facts about the origin and history of Kant's text acknowledging his great indebtedness to Adickes and Vai hinger in particular. The merits of such textual analysis appear to the best advantage, naturally, in the illuminating discussion of the various "deductions" of the Kantian cate gories. One excellent feature of the volume is its critical examination of Kant's relations to earlier thinkers. The second edition has added an Appendix on the bearing of Kant's Opus postumum upon the doctrine of the Critique. In Wai d's Study of Kant, the aim is to exhibit the in forming and central insights of the Kantian philosophy viewed as a whole. Kant's doctrine is held to be essentially -and to its credit-"anthropomorphic," by which is meant that it is a deliberate attempt to interpret the World in terms of the Self as this latter is known in reflection. That Dr. Ward should find Kant's essential achievement to lie</page><page sequence="21">698 THE MONIST in the direction of a further development of Leibniz' doc trine, should not be surprising to those acquainted with Dr. Ward's own Weltanschauung. Nearly the first fifth of the Study is devoted to a quite unusual tracing of Kant's intel lectual development. In the later pages attention, well pro portioned to its great merits, is given to the Critique of Judgment. It is high, but I think well deserved, praise that is given this work by a competent reviewer: "The proper comparison is with Caird's treatise, and despite the startling disparity of size. . . . Ward's discussion is, we may fairly affirm, no whit inferior in philosophical impor tance."40 Among recent books dealing with philosophers of the nineteenth century41 possibly the most noteworthy is Mr. W. M. Salter's Nietzsche the Thinker.42 "Criticism of Nietzsche is rife, understanding rare. . . . Few appear to have thought it worth while to study Nietzsche," the author writes in his Preface. That Mr. Salter has studied his subject, the present volume leaves no room to doubt. The Nietzsche of the successive "periods" is clearly and fully presented with abundance of well chosen quotations; and, throughout the interpretation is conspicuous for its sobri ety and restraint-some might say, even to its detriment. Not often has Nietzsche been treated to so large a dose of the apparatus of scholarship ; but the handling has certainly produced the most adequate exposition of its subject in the English language. This review must mention in conclusion two collections of historical studies : ( i ) Under the editorship of the De 40 Mr. R. F. A. Hoernle in the Philosophical Review, Vol. 33 (1924), p. 290. Cf. the review of Ward's Study by N. K. Smith in Mind, N. S. 32 (1923), p. 479. 41 In a complete survey, note would be taken certainly of many other works, such as, e. g., H. A. Reyburn's The Ethical Theory of Hegel (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1921) and W. T. Stace's The Philosophy of Hegel (London, Macmillan r.nd Co., 1924). 42 New York, Henry Holt and Co., 1917.

To the earlier volume, Professor Woodbridge contributed an excellent discussion of "Berkeley's Realism," and Pro fessor Dewey, an interpretation of "The Motivation of Hobbes' Political Philosophy." To the later volume, Mr. S. P. Lamprecht contributes a study on "Empiricism and Epistemology in David Hume," and Mr. A. G. A. Balz on "Dualism in Cartesian Psychology and Epistemology" -both well documented and worth while studies. The sec ond volume has also an interesting "Supplementary Essay" by Mr. Dewey on "The Development of American Prag matism." (2) E. A. Singer: Modern Thinkers and Pres ent Problems44 consists of a series of studies of great per sistent problems as they have been wrestled with by the classic thinkers: Bruno, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Schopen hauer, and Nietzsche. The essays, historical in spirit, may, the author tells us, "stand for moments of any thoughtful life and will have done all they were intended to do if they inform such a life with, and give it a sense of, attachment to the world that has gone before it and is going on 'round." These essays should do more than this; they will charm the reader, through their incomparably exquisite style almost to forgetfulness of the difficulty of the problems and to overlooking the great subtlety of the writer's handling of them.
