<plain_text><page sequence="1">MASEFIELD AND THE NEW UNIVERSE During the latter half of the nineteenth century a problem which profoundly influenced the outlook of the major English poets was that involved in reconciling the new scientific concepts with some sort of a spiritual faith. Although scientists were busy throughout the century with startlingly novel theories in all directions, it was the Darwinian theory of evolution which abruptly attracted the public attention to what was going on, and the poets resembled the majority in limiting their concern with science almost wholly to the evolutionary hypothesis and its implications. Recognizing that Darwin's theory involved a menace to traditional belief in an all-wise beneficent creator and in the immortal soul of the individual human being, the poets were obliged to take the new influence into account when de termining their attitude toward life. In addition to the definite conflict in the field of orthodox religion, they were particularly disturbed by the cruelty and wastefulness revealed in the strug gle for survival, which irrevocably destroyed the Wordsworthian assumption of a sympathetic healing power in nature. More over, standing midway between the iconoclasts of science and the reactionaries of theology, fascinated by the vistas opened by the new concept and yet horrified by the materialism which seemed to accompany it, the poets felt it their solemn duty to serve as the mediators and interpreters of the debate. Their interpretations were as varied as their personalities, but the im pulse to vaticinate was common to all. Tennyson, most popular of the oracles, from The Two Voices through Ln Memoriam to The Ancient Sage, developed a semi mystical confidence in his intuitive acceptance of a spiritual progress parallel with physical evolution; Browning harped on his encouraging idea that imperfection and suffering in earthly life are an essential guarantee of future advancement; Swin burne jubilated over the downfall of the anthropomorphic god and exalted man as the highest product of the creative force sym bolized as Hertha; Arnold mournfully recorded the ebb of faith</page><page sequence="2">Mase fie Id and the New Universe 337 and the misery of the shelterless human soul; Meredith pro claimed a new evangel of service to the development of the race, with immortality not individual but collective; and Hardy per sonified the process of evolution as the blind, groping persis tence of the Immanent Will. By the end of the nineteenth century the poetic excitement over evolution was practically at an end. The possible compro mises between science and religion were being exploited by vari ous new creeds which won their success largely by doing so, and the poetic conscience in that direction was eased. The younger poets, tired of didactic theorizing, turned to other in terests. Some, such as the Celtic revival group, lived so com pletely in a mystic world that the physical universe claimed none of their attention; some frankly declared their inability to solve mysteries and their determination to avoid controversial topics; some tacitly accepted the evolutionary principle as a natural element in their point of view, undisturbed by inconsistencies; a few, such as William Watson and Alfred Noyes, retained and reiterated the vague Tennysonian pantheism without contribut ing anything original to it. The only thing which the evolutionary theory gave them all alike was a new perspective in which the individual human life becomes unutterably brief and trivial in contrast with the illim itable reaches of time and space, and a closer identity of man with the other constituent parts of a cosmos produced by the same forces and from the same origins as himself; it is this which intensifies the poignant sense of physical beauty and the transience of happiness in the poems of Rupert Brooke and A. E. Housman, and it is this which drives the mystics to magnify their sense of identity with some universal force or spirit. JohnMasefield, however, stands somewhat apart from his con temporaries in his attitude toward the subject, although he has points in common with many of them, as well as with his Vic torian predecessors. In fact, he alone among the moderns has attacked the heart of the problem, not echoing the Victorians, but making an independent survey of the same territory. An analysis of his views and the process by which he developed 6</page><page sequence="3">338 The Sewanee Reviezv them sheds light both on Masefield's mind and on the whole contemporary state of the case. Masefield's earlier poems were entirely objective, descriptions of the sea and seamen, with no tendency toward reflection. One would not hesitate to ascribe to the poet the point of view uttered in Vagabond: An' why I live, an' why the old world spins, Are things I never knowed. On coming to the poem called Laugh and Be Merry, however, one finds two ideas characteristic of those who have attempted a mystical interpretation of evolution. One is the view of the progress of the human race as a triumphal procession in which the individual life plays a brief but essential part? Laugh, for the time is brief, a thread the length of a span. Laugh and be proud to belong to the old proud pageant of man. The other is the symbol by which the creative process is de scribed as a rhythmic and pleasurable self-expression, a conjunc ture of harmony and joy: . . . . remember, in olden time God made Heaven and Earth for joy He took in a rhyme, Made them, and filled them full with the strong red wine of His mirth, The splendid joy of the stars : the joy of the earth. The source of these metaphysical ideas is easy to find. When Masefield settled in London he became associated with a group of Theosophists which included Yeats, Synge, AE, and others. In the poem Biography (1911) he depicts how his life was cen tered about the discussions Under strange pictures of the wakened soul To whom this earth was but a burnt-out coal. In those eager debates there was no doubt of the spiritual im portance of man, the supremacy of intuition as opposed to reason : Those glittering moments that a spirit lends That all may be imagined from the flash, The cloud-hid god-game through the lightning gash. They looked forward to the great spiritual developments still in the future :</page><page sequence="4">M ase fie Id and the New Universe 339 The glory of mood where human frailty failed, The forts of human light not yet assailed. Under such influence he believed firmly in the spiritual evo lution which proceeds unrecognized beneath the surface of physical life. The opening of this same poem, Biography, strik ingly echoes the opening of In Memoriam, with its declaration that dead selves are cast off as the soul climbs by means of its moments of intuition: Men do not heed the rungs by which men climb Those glittering steps, those milestones upon Time, Those tombstones of dead selves, those hours of birth, Those moments of the soul in years of earth. He did not stop, however, at this rather general belief in spiritual progress. A leading tenet of Theosophy is reincarnation, wherein the soul goes through an evolution parallel with that of the body, with accumulated experience from past lives correspond ing to the hereditary traits by which the body is molded. To this doctrine Masefield professes complete adherence in A Creed (1911): I hold that when a person dies His soul returns again to earth ; Arrayed in some new flesh-disguise Another mother gives him birth. With sturdier limbs and brighter brain The old soul takes the road again .... All that I rightly think or do, Or make, or spoil, or bless, or blast, Is curse or blessing justly due For sloth or effort in the past. My life's a statement of the sum Of vice indulged, or overcome .... So shall I fight, so shall I tread, In this long war beneath the stars : So shall a glory wreathe my head, So shall I faint and show the scars, Until this case, this clogging mould, Be smithied all to kingly gold. In the same vein, he says in Twilight, "I know that death can not last;" and in The Word, And may we find, when ended is the page, Death but a tavern on our pilgrimage.</page><page sequence="5">340 The Sewanee Review Before long, however, he began to express a more modified mysticism, less derivative and more indicative of personal cogi tation. There is a trace of the reincarnation idea still in the poem called Truth, but it is subordinate to the more general thought that the one reality surviving death is a man's vision of truth: Man with his burning soul Has but an hour of breath To build a ship of Truth In which his soul may sail, Sail on the sea of death. For death takes toll Of beauty, courage, youth, Of all but Truth. . . . The soul goes out alone On seas unknown. . . . Truth will preserve through death ; Perhaps the stars will rise, The stars like globes. The ship my striving made May see night fade. Again, this immortal vision is identified with imaginative cre ation, at the end of Fragments: The dream that fires man's heart to make, To build, to do, to sing or say A beauty Death can never take, An Adam from the crumbling clay. The cautious "perhaps" and "may" with which the poem Truth qualified its references to immortality, as contrasted with the confidence of A Creed, proved to be the first indication of a thorough grappling with the whole question of science and faith. The Sonnets, published in 1915, and others logically sequential in his later volumes, form an extensive and impassioned discus sion of the problem. Certain basic ideas recur with the insis tence almost of obsession?the decay of ancient civilizations, the chemical constituents of the human body, the mystery of the ego. The whole group is reminiscent of Lfi Memoriam in being a loosely connected and often contradictory series of poems re vealing various moods and comments centering on the conflict ing opinions of evolutionary science and metaphysical faith</page><page sequence="6">Masefield and the New Universe 341 concerning the question of human origins and destiny. His impulse toward accepting intuitive belief in a spiritual principle is tempered not only by his rational interest in scientific facts but also by a prevalent melancholy which tends to dwell on the brevity of life, the cruelty of chance, and the physical dissolu tion of the body. This preoccupation makes him appear more akin to Hardy, Housman, and other moderns than to the more confident Victorians. Masefield's basic idea is an identification of the world-soul with the beauty of all phenomena, and the individual soul with the imagination which appreciates it. Th^re are clearly distin guishable stages in the process by which he developed this apotheosis of Beauty. His earliest poems are full of the "wan derlust", that restless impulse which draws men irresistibly away from material comfort and happiness in pursuit of some nameless illusion. After a while we find him treating it less as a psychological fact and more as a symbol : the pursuit comes to be definitely a search for the ideal beauty which transcends phenomena, as expressed in Visiony Invocation', and very ex plicitly in The Seekers. Thus the wanderlust is sublimated into a Platonic abstraction of Beauty, and the wanderers become the artists, fascinated by the tantalizing glimpses of her which occasionally flash before them in the physical world. So, as in the stanza already quoted from Fragments, imaginative creation, being a contribution to immortal Beauty, is the only permanent spiritual existence of man. The sonnets are devoted to debating whether this world-soul of Beauty and individual soul of imagination have any objective existence, and if not what element in the human being, unex plained by the scientists, produces the illusion. The only pos sible clue is within oneself: Here in the self is all that men can know Of Beauty .... Here in the self which withers like a flower .... Here in the flesh, within the flesh, behind, Swift in the blood and throbbing on the bone, Beauty herself, the universal mind, Eternal April wandering alone. The god, the holy ghost, the atoning Lord, Here in the flesh, the never-yet explored.</page><page sequence="7">342 The Sewanee Review Thus he concentrates within the individual soul?inhabiting the perishable body?not only the trinity of orthodox Christianity, but also "the universal mind" (i. e., the world-soul of the mys tics) and "Eternal April" (/. e., the creative force of nature). By diligent introspection he has sought to grasp the illusive in tuition of Beauty, hoping to discover whether it is an external inspiration or the result of subconscious physical processes: Is the unfeeling mud stabbed by a ray Cast by an unseen splendour's great advance ? Or does the glory gather crumb by crumb Unseen, within, as coral islands rise ? Describing the death of the brain and the decay of the corpse, he draws an analogy with the gradual extinction of a great heavenly body. In the latter, however, there is really a cycle of recurrent life, since the dead sun eventually collides with another and a new active star is evolved. Similarly it is pos sible that the soul survives, or at any rate that the living cells are reincarnated in new forms of life: It may be that the loosened soul may find Some new delight of living without limbs . . . It may be that the million cells of sense, Loosed from their seventy years' adhesion, pass Each to some joy of changed experience, Weight in the earth or glory in the grass ; It may be that we cease ; we cannot tell. Even if we cease life is a miracle. After this very non-committal summary of the possibility of sur vival, he turns to the scientific definition of the body, finding even the unconscious functions mysterious: What am I, Life? A thing of watery salt Held in cohesion by unresting cells, Which work they know not why, which never halt, Myself unwitting where their Master dwells. I do not bid them, yet they toil, they spin ; A world which uses me as I use them, Nor do I know which end or which begin Nor which to praise, which pamper, which condemn. This is the entity?"this myriad I"?which responds to the beauty of nature and feels impressions. The poet thinks that if he could penetrate to the identity dwelling within the chang</page><page sequence="8">Masefield and the New Universe 343 ing cells of the body he could perceive the non-physical soul beyond; rarely has physiology been more strikingly poetized: If I could get within this changing I, This ever altering thing which yet persists, Keeping the features_it is reckoned by, While each component atom breaks or twists, If, wandering past strange groups of shifting forms, Cells at their hidden marvels hard at work, Pale from much toil, or red from sudden storms, I might attain to where the Rulers lurk. If, pressing past the guards in those grey gates, The brain's most folded intertwisted shell, I might attain to that which alters fates, The King, the supreme self, the Master Cell, Then, on Man's earthly peak, I might behold The unearthly self beyond, unguessed, untold. The poet is amazed that "this atom which contains the whole, this which imagined God and is the soul" should require such a clumsy and destructible instrument as the body, unless its concerns are mainly earthly. If it is a heavenly thing, why has it "such heavy chains to sense?" If earthly, why such unrest and discontent with clay? The obvious conclusion is that it partakes of both realms : Ah, we are neither heaven nor earth, but men ; Something that uses and despises both. This transitional creature enjoys beauty and also exercises in tellect. He cannot admire the rose without thinking that it is embedded in the vanished beauty of past ages and will soon give place to future growths. All these generations of beauty and of the human intuitions stimulated by it combine to form the spirit of Beauty inhabiting the earth and providing "the faith which nothing can destroy". Man rises superior to the forces of nature and controls them, but within him are similar forces "untamed, unreckoned"?the power of imagination that links him with the spirit of the world. This inward entity is responsible for evolution: O little self, within whose smallness lies All that man was, and is, and will become. This power of imagination, which created man's gods, is cloaked by the darkness and folly of commonplace life. The poet's in</page><page sequence="9">344 The Sewanee Review tuitive sense of an external spirit of beauty corresponding to this soul becomes distinctly pantheistic: .... all the summer flowers Were only glimpses of your starry powers, Beautiful and inspired dust they were. But when he demands the meaning'of this spirit it fades from his vision. Still seeking an explanation, he turns to the specific evolu tionary theory. He considers separately the two forms of life, animal and vegetable. Describing the former, he emphasizes its ruthless pursuit of food, always entailing the death of its prey. Masefield is primarily impressed, as Tennyson and Hardy were, by the essential cruelty of the struggle for survival : Restless and hungry, still it moves and slays, Feeding its beauty on dead beauty's bones, Most merciless in all its million ways, Its breath for singing bought by dying groans. From this voracious type^the mind was eventually evolved: Roving so far with such a zest to kill (Its strongness adding hunger) that at last Its cells attained beyond the cruel skill To where life's earliest impulses are past. Then this creation of the linked lusts, To move and eat, still under their control, Hunts for his prey in thought, his thinking thrusts Through the untrodden jungle of the soul. The quarry of the intellectual hunt is to establish the reality of the external spiritual force?"to prove the Thing Within a Thing Without"?and repeatedly the searcher is baffled to find "the imagined godhead but a form of thought". Yet ever again the intuitive flash inspires fresh efforts. Turning to the other form of life, Masefield describes the great power of Will in the seed which enables it to take root, draw sustenance from the earth, and expand into tree or flower. He wonders whether in the vegetable kingdom also the ruthless struggle prevails. Per haps there is a communal instinct?"a great green common wealth of thought"?determining the precedence of growth "by secret stir which in each plant abides", Or is it, as with us, unresting strife, And each consent a lucky gasp for life ?</page><page sequence="10">Masefield and the New Universe 345 He proceeds to consider the most recent step in human develop ment, the discarding of belief in external, personal gods. In spite of all iconoclasm, however, man's instinct to see a spiritual first cause will not be thwarted: There is no God, as I was taught in youth, Though each, according to his stature, builds Some covered shrine for what he thinks the truth, Which day by day his reddest heart-blood gilds . . . There is no God, but we who breathe the air, Are God ourselves and touch God everywhere. On this pantheism Masefield affirms more positively his faith in immortality: the body withers, "though his life renews in Aprils of the soul". Returning to the motif of beauty, he repeats that it is the determining factor of progress; Having all art, all science, all control Over the still unsmithied, even as Time Cradles the generations of man's soul, You are the light to guide, the way to climb. He contrasts man's puny interests, recurrent through endless generations, with the rare intuitive gleams that are his only lasting contribution to the world soul : Time being an instant in eternity, Beauty above man's million years must see The heaped corrupted mass that had to die, The husk of man that set the glitter free ; Now from those million bodies in the dark, Forgotten, rotten, part of fields or roads, The million gleam united makes a spark Which Beauty sees among her star abodes. And from the bodies comes a sigh, "Alas, We hated, fought, and killed, as separate men ; Now all is merged and we are in the grass, Our efforts merged, would we had known it then. All our lives' battle, all our spirits' dream, Nought in themselves, a clash which made a gleam. He utters an impassioned protest against fatalism, inspired by science, which sees man helpless amid physical forces that use his emotions for furthering natural processes:</page><page sequence="11">346 The Sewanee Review If all be governed by the moving stars .... We are but pawns, ignobler than the grass Cropped by the beast and crunched and tossed aside. Is all this beauty that does inhabit heaven Trail of a planet's fire ? is all this lust A chymic means by warring stars contriven To bring the violets out of Caesar's dust ? Better be grass, or in some hedge unknown The spilling rose whose beauty is its own. Developing this concept into definite astrological influences, he envisages a wandering planet which may control evolution by its occasional visits: . . . made (men) stand erect and bade them build Nobler than hovels plaited in the mire, Gave them an altar and a god to gild, Bridled the brooks for them and fettered fire ; And, in another coming, forged the steel Which, on life's scarlet wax, forever set Longing for beauty bitten as a seal That blood not clogs nor centuries forget, That built Atlantis, and in time will raise That grander thing whose image haunts our days. The concluding sonnets of the series reiterate the pantheistic vision of the spirit of beauty animating all phenomena: For you are all, all fire, all living form, Marvel in man and glory in the worm. He then reviews the various possibilities that may follow death, ?extinction, conscious survival, reincarnation, or union with the general spirit of beauty: When all these million cells that are my slaves Fall from my pourried ribs and leave me lone, A living speck among a world of graves, What shall I be, that spot in the unknown ? A glow-worm in a night that floats the sun ? Or deathless dust feeling the passer's foot ? An eye undying mourning things undone ? Or seed for quickening free from prisoning fruit ? Or an eternal jewel on your robe, Caught to your heart, one with the April fire That made me yours as man upon the globe, One with the Spring, a breath of all desire, One with the primrose, present in all joy? Or pash that rots, which pismires can destroy ?</page><page sequence="12">Masefield and the New Universe 347 The final sonnet offers no answer to the questions; the agnostic conclusion is that whatever may come, ephemeral life is to be enjoyed, the generations continue; whether the sequel is death or change, good or evil, "we cannot tell". Further sonnets and other short poems in his later volumes resume the discussion of certain ideas already treated, but pre sent no significant change of opinion or increase in assurance. He never rises above a temperate and admittedly unverified hope for some kind of spiritual survival and racial progress de pendent on the intuitive sense of beauty. Typical of them all is the one called The Passing Strange (1920). Of seventy-two lines, fifty-one are devoted to a mournful survey of human life: Perpetual in perpetual change The unknown passing through the strange. The physical impermanence of the body, the inevitable passing of all beauty and joy and effort, the aimless cruelty of human be ings, all are included, pointing to the logical conclusion that there is neither progress nor survival. In the closing lines, however, he points out that the spirit, like the cock at mid night, crows from trust That death will change because it must ; the analogy of all nature suggests that there is perpetual change but no extinction: . . . . we have no home, Only a beauty, only a power, Sad in the fruit, bright in the flower, Endlessly erring for its hour But gathering, as we stray, a sense Of Life, so lovely and intense, It lingers when we wander hence. That those who follow feel behind Their backs, when all before is blind, Our joy, a rampart to the mind. Thus, once again, he wistfully reverts to the sense of beauty as our one argument against the materialism of science. Clearly, then, the extensive group of reflective poems which rank among the best productions of Masefield's later years con</page><page sequence="13">348 The Sewanee Review stitute a record of the poet's effort to comprehend the new universe which has been revealed by recent science, and to postulate an acceptable relationship between it and the human soul. Thoroughly accepting the evolutionary theory with its attendant biological and physiological assertions, as well as its revision of historical perspective, he attempts to find a place in such a system for the intuition of beauty, expecting thereby to provide some sort of spiritual belief, particularly with regard to the existence of the human soul, its survival after death, and the existence of some external superphysical power. In this undertaking, Masefield has been completely in accord with the leading Victorian poets, who were compelled by the Darwinian controversy to a similar revaluation of man's place in the universe, amounting to a substitute for traditional religion which should preserve its essentials but find terms and parables consistent with the hypotheses of science. The chief indica tion of the twentieth century in his poems is the resignation and inconclusiveness which replace the didactic confidence of his predecessors. There is much significance in the resemblances and differences, as revealing both Masefield's mind and the mood of his generation; and there is a particular interest in see ing how he proceeded from adherence to a ready-made mystical creed to an unmistakably personal investigation of the eternal problem.
