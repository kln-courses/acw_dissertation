<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL BIOLOGY THE LIVES OF A CELL. Notes of a Biology Watcher. By Lewis Thomas. Viking Press, New York. $6.95. iv + 153 p.: no index. 1974. The New England Journal of Medicine has withstood the onslaughts of time and specialization to preserve its image; it is still, according to my medical acquaint- ances, prestigious and respected, a patrician journal in its own right. One would expect, therefore, any writings which have graced its pages, as have the essays in this volume, to be reflective of its standing in the medical community. In a sense this is true; the writing is polished, and there is an urbanity, a worldliness and a sense of comfortable and assured well-being about it. But if, after a first casual reading, one searches critically for substance as well as well- turned phrases, meaning as 'well as entertainment, an uneasiness is very likely to set in. As the mental eye becomes word-adapted, the smooth flow of un- usual points of view, clever images, and inviting intellectual vistas turn out, all too frequently, to be simply verbal mirages which dissolve or change shape as one tries to grasp their essence. I have the uncom- fortable feeling of being subjected, in literary form, to the bedside manner of the physician. To say the very least, The Lives of a Cell is a curious book, its musings-I can find no better word to describe these essays-covering a number of seem- ingly unrelated topics. It is a book whose eye-catching title bears little immediate resemblance to its content, but whose subtitle is appropriate; a book of compari- sons, some apt, some strained, some so obtuse as to leave the reader in wonder as to the reasons for their inclusion; a book of analogies and homologies, with no clear distinction made between them; a book in which scientific fantasy and not so subtle mysticism are combined with, but not necessarily distinguishable from, hard fact; a book in which chance and design share equally and without apparent conflict the evolutionary stage; a book about a cell which leaves in doubt the definition of a cell and what a cell is all about. It is, I reiterate, a curious book, and reader response, to judge from the 1974 summer population of Woods Hole, will run the gamut from the superla- tive to tolerable amusement to utter nonsense. My own response falls nearer to the nether end of the scale even though I found some of the essays quite enjoyable. The opening essay provides the raison d'etre of the book, namely, that man is not simply a part of nature, he is "embedded in nature." In fact, he is so embed- ded, according to the author, as to question the validity of the use of "I" and "we" as personal pronouns. The problem then becomes one of explaining this embedment. The approach taken is a holistic one, and the cell of the title emerges as a set of intercom- municating Chinese boxes or "cells," one within the</page><page sequence="2">74 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 50 other, the innermost of which is the procaryotic bacterium or even a virus and the outermost the earth, with the atmosphere its living membrane. In between these extremes are a variety of other "cells": eucaryotic cells with their own inner world of invasive entities such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, viruses, centrioles and basal bodies, each with its own genetic code (the inclusion of centrioles in this category is clearly a mistake since they can form de nove and do not possess DNA or RNA for replicative purposes); organs and organisms as complex cells, and societies and populations as even more complex cells. Also interspersed are ruminations on still other kinds of specialized cells: the Iks who "have gone crazy," and "each Ik has become a group, a one-man tribe on its own"; words, some of which are "virtual anthills" in their complexity and ramification; language ("We have DNA for grammar, neurons for syntax"); the MBL which lives a life peculiar unto itself and where Aplysia, a sea slug, "has been found by neurophy- siologists to be filled with truth." The intellectual glue that holds these essays together is not readily evident, but I believe that it is the concept of symbiosis which surfaces here and there throughout the volume. If I am correct in this assessment, what I think the author sees as the living world and its behavior, are symbionts within symbionts within still other sym- bionts, with the earth itself being the largest of the "cells." Who, or what, runs the show will pose a problem for the reader, and the author makes any number of questionable statements which are justifia- ble only on the grounds of poetic license. "A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied." Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, . . . perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts." Viruses "may be a mechanism for keeping new mutant kinds of DNA in the widest circulation among us." Territorality "is evidently de- signed for the homeostasis of the earth." In speaking of the atmosphere, the author states that "for what it is designed to accomplish [i.e., for sustaining life], it is as infallible as anything in nature," . . . and "it is . . . our fantastic luck that oxygen filters out the very bands of ultraviolet light that are most devastating for nucleic acids and proteins." One would like to state that these pieces of writing are "filled with truth," but it is probably more accurate to suggest that an overriding concern for the apt phrase, a high degree of anthropomorphism, and the continual intrusiQn of "design" in a pre-deter- minative, pre-Darwinian sense, have robbed the vol- ume of any solid merit it might have possessed. This is indeed to be regretted, for the subject matter of these essays is important, but good writing, humanistic or scientific, cannot sacrifice substance, meaning and truth to the resonance of words and the neatly turned metaphor. One might draw comparisons with similar writings in "Marginalia" in the American Scientist, or in "Bios" and "This View of Life" in Natural History, but perhaps the only comment that is apropos is that science remains science while medicine continues to remain largely an art, and that these essays reflect this difference more accurately than any critique can establish.
