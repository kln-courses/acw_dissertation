<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 REPORTS AND NEWS MUSIC IN THE LIFE OF MAN: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR A WORLD HISTORY* I The 19th-century philosopher of science Charles Sanders Pierce once offered that &gt;thought is what it is, only by virtue of its addressing a future thought&lt;.l It will serve our purpose to spend a moment with that statement, rooted as it is in one of the more sophisticated conceptions of joint human inquiry to come from a philosopher. For a world history of music, as individually daunting as it may seem, is very much a matter of joint human inquiry and subject to its laws, whatever they may be. Peirce's formulation can be brought a lot closer to home with a simple substitution of terms. Try this one: Labor on a set of volumes is what it is only by virtue of its addressing a future set of volumes. That proposition is both grand and humbling in its implications, and we will return to it before we conclude. An even simpler substitution yields this result: Labor on a set of volumes is what it is, only by virtue of its addressing a future thought. Here we come round to the heart of what a daunting project such as our Music in the Life of Man can and shlould mean: mean within what Peirce would call variously &gt;the community of scientists&lt; or &gt;the community of philosophers&lt; (and for which, in Peirce's language, we may read the &gt;unlimited&lt; community of disciplined and candid minds - our projected audience). So, let's first describe the labor in question and then maybe we can, hypothetically of course, catch it in the act of addressing a future thought. MLM will enlist scholars from all over the world and from many disciplines in a vast coordinated effort. It will serve as a focus for both international and regional cooperation in the coordination of existing knowledge and the fostering of new research. The participating scholars themselves are the MLM project's chief strength and promise thus far: not only for the quality of their reputations but, just as critical in this case, for the variety of their backgrounds. Scholars (and, in some cases, networks * The international office of the project is: Music in the Life of Man: A World History, International Music Council, UNESCO:, 1i, rue Miollis, 75732 Paris, CEDEX 15, France. 1 Charles Sanders PiEIRCE, )&gt;Some Consequences of the Four Incapacities&lt;&lt;, in Philosophical Writings of Peirce, ed.

An inexpensively published forum for &gt;works in progress&lt; will afford the necessary mutual exposure to, and interaction between, hypotheses and working categories: as will the continuing series of international meetings, now being organized along regional lines, and the establishment of cross-regional projects, such as a central system for locating collections of traditional musics in existing archives and central files providing access to organological and lexico- graphical data. Ultimately Music in the Life of Man will appear in twelve volumes. Framing the work of the regional coordinators, in both a temporal and a conceptual sense, will be the first and last bound publications of the series: a ground-laying volume of essays devoted to axiomatic questions; and a final, synoptic volume in which linkages, commonalities, and possible universals are proposed, and related hypotheses for future investigations presented. The ten regional volumes will be something quite different from simple collections of chapters on individual countries. Even in those cases where- current states are the nominal topics, what will have been addressed is a developing model of vast musical cultures, enormously complicated both in their structures and their origins, and themselves the source of influences spilling over politically determined frontiers and even extending into other geocultural regions. The ,&gt;altitude&lt; of perspective required for such a task prompts a return to Peirce's vertiginous conception of a thinker addressing an intangible that has yet to exist. Recapturing our leading quotation in its original context, we may be given some philosophical footing on the little-traveled paths we have chosen: ... .so a thought is what it is, only by virtue of its addressing a future thought which is in its value as thought identical with it, though more developed,&lt;. Put another way, the fortuitous presence of lacunae at a particular moment is in itself no commentary on the worth or timeliness of an enterprise. As a penetrating observer of scientific life as well as a trained scientist and mathematician himself, and as one of the first to resurrect and put to modern uses the mental experiments of the Middle Ages, Peirce was keenly aware that the precariousness of the serious inquirer's position is not some troublesome exception to a rule to be smoothed over or waited out. Rather, that precariousness is something built into the reality of all rigorous inquiry, from the framing and testing of hypotheses in physical experiment to the shaping of explanatory models to account for patterns of social and historical fact. Under the name, -fallibilism&lt;&lt; Peirce made this insight a cornerstone of his entire approach. So, if we are to believe Peirce, no perfectly opportune moment for the inauguration of these volumes awaits us, no research-ripened stage when all the relevant data will have been collected and interested parties need only compile it. The very issue of relevance is conditioned by the pre- carious act of question-asking on scales large and small. And the value of 104</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 our &gt;radical experiment&lt; can never be judged beforehand, except to say that it can only truly fail by not being launched. In what specific ways, then, can we succeed? Well, to quote Peirce twice more, we may be granted provisional success - the only kind available in projects not limited to practical and predetermined ends - should the volumes 1) &gt;push inquiry&lt;&lt; and 2) &gt;&gt;not block the way of in- quiry&lt;. The virtual ensurance of the first is not difficult to demonstrate; that inquiry has been &gt;pushed- may in fact be one of the main charges lodged against our necessarily hubric and necessarily fallible work. Still, as the following sections will show, a world-wide apparatus, which did not previously exist, is moving into place; its sole object being to bring people of learning together to plan, write, mutually inform, edit, and jointly publish on a subject that, by its nature embraces every level and aspect of human life. As to Peirce's second criterion - that we not &gt;,block&lt;&lt; inquiry - that is a far more delicate matter. First, the outcome is practically untestable, resting almost entirely on conjectures of what could have been. Second, and more important, it takes more than energy and good will to prevent such a thing from occurring. While a redoubling of efforts could always multiply the number of studies, push them to a satisfactory conclusion, and see to the dissemination of their results, that same forcefulness, if grossly misguided, if too married to unities not yet justified by available know- ledge, could do subtle and inoalculable harm to subsequent generations. Or, on a more overt level, it could frighten a reactive and influential group away from similar adventures, much to their own, and everyone else's, impoverishment. The solution, as we have seen, is not to shy away from the commission of error to such an extent that nothing is said. Rather, it is to do what musicians ought to be when presented with unfamiliar levels and kinds of complexity: be patient; listen openly and carefully; remain fluid. Our time-table and the nature of the editorial process allows for this, leaving a span of some eight years between the initial plunge into methodological questions with the first volume and our version of &gt;&gt;addressing a future set of volumes&lt; with the twelfth. The editorial guidelines are sufficiently flexible in their boundaries so. that the unanticipated will not be forced into molds foreign to its'nature, but they are also sufficiently the product of examined assumptions to provide guidance where it is needed and wanted. For instance, the question of musical universals has only recently been raised again and the settlement of opinion is nowhere at hand.2 To have 2 The World of Music, vol. XIX, no. 1/2, 1977.

But established, human universals - speech, song, extended education and training, the making of tools and their investiture with meaning and value - these are not merely particulars whose claim to universality is that they represent the lowest common denominator. They are full-fledged mysteries, inexhaustible and interpenetrating, and all musics partake of them in some important and revealing way. They there- fore have a place as categories in the guidelines for those who wish to engage with them. II History and Organization of the Project Early History The genesis of the Music in the Life of Man project was a suggestion made by the late Professor Zofia Lissa to the International Music Council General Assembly in Moscow in 1971 that the IMC sponsor a History of the World's Music. She called for a &gt;reconstruction of our axiomatical system into one which would embrace all the musical phenomena, and not be confined (as was the practice in the past) to research in the musical material and cultural values of one part of one continent: the Occident?. Although accepted as an IMC activity, the idea remained dormant until UNESCO included it in its cultural program in 1979. A series of ex- ploratory meetings followed (Paris, October 1979; Berlin, September 1980; Sao Paolo, November 1980). The intention of these meetings was to examine a variety of approaches for such a projected history. The con- structive results of these meetings may be seen in the series of preliminary studies published in The World of Music XX/3, 1980, under the title, ~To- ward a World History of Music?.3 A comparison of the first printed account of the project (The World of Music, ibid. p. 56-57) with the present article will provide an interesting insight into how the thinking, the dimensions, and the shape of the project have evolved. A subsequent meeting in Bayreuth (September 1981), was devoted to hammering out a means for the practical implementation of MLM (originally entitled Music as a Language of Man: A World History).

The feasibility study was accepted with favor by UNESCO. In early 1982, Music in the Life of Man was formally launched as a UNESCO-sponsored project to be administered through the International Music Council. Operating Structure At two subsequent meetings (Strasbourg, September 1982 and Stock- holm, September 1983), a president and Board of Directors representing six major international organizations as well as a general coordinator were designated. The board then appointed regional coordinators for the seven principal regions and a number of special consultants (NB: several sub- regional coordinators and consultants including archaeologists, anthropo- logists, sociologists, historians, etc. are still to be named). The full operating structure was established as follows: Board of Directors Barry S. Brook (President) Dieter Christensen Ludwig Finscher Ivan Vandor J. H.

I and XII) containing essays of supra-regional concern, as follows: I. Methodological volume: introductory essays on such topics as theories on origins of music biological considerations musical archaeology musical systems sound producers paleography and systems of notation common processes, for example: acculturation, synchronism, sincre- tism, etc. 20-th-century tools for musical analysis historiography, intellectual history, relations to other disciplines II, III, IV: Asia and Oceania V: Africa VI: North Africa and West Asia; the Arab Region VII, VIII, IX: Europe I and II, plus the Soviet Asian Republics.

Country Profiles: Since MLM is designed to deal with broad themes covering entire regions or sub-regions, each moder nation will be re- presented at the end of the appropriate regional volume by a &gt;country profile&lt; containing the basic facts of its national life, its culture, and its music, as well as a chronology of its history (e. g. demographic, religious, racial, and political composition; major cultural and musical institutions; educational resources, instruments, genres, etc.). New Research: The Guidelines state that where our present knowledge is insufficient, new research shall be undertaken (e. g. for Oceania). UNESCO Participation Program funds, as well as private foundation sub- ventions, are being sought for such purposes. Publication: MLM is aimed at the intelligent layman as well as the specialist - Peirce's &gt;&gt;community of disciplined and candid minds&lt;. On the basis of already evinced publisher interest, it is expected to appear initially in three editions - English, French, and German. Eventually, it is hoped, MLM will also appear in several other world languages: as well as in two- wolume, individually organized condensations, to be made available in as many other tongues as possible. 109</page><page sequence="8">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 III Editorial Guidelines (Revised October 1983) The Music in the Life of Man is intended to provide a comprehensive history of the musical cultures of the world based on our present know- ledge and, where such knowledge is insufficient, on new research. It will provide descriptions of the present state of music and musical practice in the main geocultural regions of the world as well as their historical development, taking into account the particular philosophies or concepts of history of each region, the factors that influenced historical develop- ment, interaction between cultures, and the musical linkages between cultures within a region as well as those that link the main regions. The methodology will be analytical, descriptive, and to a large extent comparative since the aim must be to present broad pictures of culture areas as a whole in terms of their current usages and history rather than detailed studies of the music and history of individual societies. The purpose of these guidelines is to draw attention to some of the important topics that need to be considered by individual contributors. Each contributor will have to interpret the guidelines in terms of the specific problems and practices of his area and to include other materials relevant to his area not mentioned here. The Guidelines as a whole will be refined and expanded during the early stages of Phase Two, the better to assist authors of individual segments. The Guidelines are presented in three parts as follows: Part One. The Synchronic Perspective: music in our time Part Two. The Historical Perspective: successions and evolutions Part Three. Conclusions Special instructions and models will be provided for: Bibliographies and footnotes Iconography-color, black and white Discography Chart, maps, drawings Separate treatment for major types of instruments Separate treatment of terms needing definition Country profiles PART ONE The Synchronic Perspective: Music in our Time I. SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND I.1. The geographical, social, cultural, and general historical background of the culture area should be provided as an introduction to the main study. It should include geographical location and extent of area, countries, demo- graphic composition (ethnic groups where appropriate), languages and 110</page><page sequence="9">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 linguistic groups, impact of social, political, religious, and economic institu- tions (where appropriate) on musical life. 1.2. Where a particular philosophy, cosmogony, or world view is important for understanding the organization and use of music in the culture area, or where it is necessary to deal with special attitudes to music, or the role of music in the cultures of the area, this can be discussed here. Music, and the act of music making, may have cosmological connotations or ideological ramifications that will require elaboration under one or more major category-headings in the study. II. MUSICAL LIFE II.1. The study should deal with all genres or &gt;idioms&lt; of music in the area, the institutional influence upon music, as well as the problem of patronage where relevant. 11.2. As far as possible note should be taken of the categories and termin- ology recognized in the culture area for each genre. Further classification of musical types on the basis of function or social categories and the events or institutions to which they are linked may be attempted to facilitate cross-cultural comparison. General categories such as court music, ritual music, ceremonial music, etc., should be set up where appropriate. 11.3. The absorption of musical knowledge outside of the cultural institu- tions developed for that purpose (be they households, attachments to master musicians, conservatories) can be considered here as well. Where a culture area makes distinctions between levels of musical activity or between the activities of &gt;specialists&lt; (that is musicians who may not necessarily be professional but recognized in society on the basis of achievement) and others, or where an area recognizes different categories of musicians, attention should be drawn to this so that its historical development can be discussed at a later stage. 11.4. The systems of training and methods of &gt;recruitment? of musicians in the culture area should be considered. In some cultures these operate through households, attachment to master musicians, or special institutions. 11.5. The extent to which individual authorship of a work, or body of works, is recognized and deemed important may be significant basis for comparison in a later stage of the study: similarly, the recognition of *schools. and lines of influence. III. MUSICAL SYSTEMS Where appropriate detailed description of the musical &gt;language&lt;&lt; or languages: III.1. Sound sources (vocal and instrumental) of the culture area can be viewed as both technological or technical products and symbolic objects/ /processes resonant with meaning. (For instance, a Tibetan lama and an Italian tenor developing their respectives techniques will conceive of the human voice and its boundaries in far different terms.) 111</page><page sequence="10">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 111.2. Accordance of a gender to an instrument (based on shape, timbre, social function), cosmological role (based on material source, elemental or mythical association), or general anthropomorphic characteristics (based on performer's attitude of identification or reverence) may come into play here. 111.3. Multi-Part Relationships (including harmony, polyphony, polyrhythm, heterophony, etc.). 11.4. Review of specific characteristics of the musical system-scales, tuning systems, modes, rhythm, forms, harmony, etc. The same considerations raised in III.2, above, may apply. (Witness the ancient Western identifica- tion of the physically generated harmonic series with the masculine element and the theoretically generated &gt;&gt;sub-harmonic&lt; series with the feminine). IV. PERFORMANCE TRADITIONS IV.1 This section should consider: the various performance traditions or performance organisations generally emphasised in the culture area - solo traditions, group or ensemble traditions. IV.2. Special consideration should be given to concepts of performance and modes of presentation in the culture area. Use of space and distancing/ /binding procedures going on between active musicians and audience or other participants may be of special relevance here. Body motion in per- formance, the physical )languages&lt; complementing the aural in the act of music making may require attention. IV.3. Improvisation should be given full treatment here in cultures where this is emphasized. Some suggested categories are listed below: IV.2a Improvisation as agonistics IV.2b Improvisation as embroidery IV.2c Imrovisation as embodiment of creative principle IV.2d Improvisation as exploration of musical space. IV.4. Song occupies a special position between speech and instrumental music (without being a hybrid of the two; the historical primacy of speech over song cannot be established). V. MUSIC, RELATED ARTS AND COMMUNICATION This section should be devoted to studies of the interrelations of: V.1. Music and Dance V.2. Music and Drama (the Music Theatre where appropriate) V.3. Music and Visual Arts V.4. Music and Language (including where appropriate studies of melody and tone, stress patterns and rhythm) V.5. Music and Ritual - Ceremony (in some culture areas music and religion may be given separate treatment) V.6. Music and Therapy. 112</page><page sequence="11">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 PART TWO The Historical Perspective: successions and evolutions The main body of the study should be devoted to this part where the materials of the culture area allow for the history to be dealt with in depth taking into account culture specific concepts of historical time. The aspects to be discussed and the chronology to be adopted should be determined by the contributor in relation to the historical materials of the culture area. The aspects listed in Part I can generally also be discussed in historical terms. All available sources of historical evidence, including documentary sources, archaeological and linguistic evidence and oral traditions (or &gt;&gt;oral histories- i. e. interviews with musicians, etc.) where appropriate, should be used in order to give as complete a picture of the music history of the area as possible. For convenience of reference the topics can be combined under the follow- ing headings, although they could be integrated in the final presentation if appropriate to the nature of the materials from the culture area. Aspects under each heading should be expanded to fit the characteristics of the area. VI. SOCIAL HISTORY VI.1. The musical results of interaction with other areas through trade, religion, political conflicts. This could be presented in relation to different historical epochs. VI.2. Development of musical life and musical institutions, patronage, etc. VI.3. Change in performance organisation, etc., arising from social factors. VII. STYLISTIC HISTORY VII.1. Theory and practice VII.2. Systems of notation VII.3. Sound sources VII.4. History of &gt;-forms-&lt; (where applicable) VII.5. History of specific genres. VIII. CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENTS IN MUSIC VIII.1. Current creative developments VIII.2. Performance VIII.3. Education and research VIII.4. Institutions and organizations VIII.5. Role of the media. 113</page><page sequence="12">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 PART THREE Conclusions IX. LINKAGES, COMPARISONS, SUMMATION X. GAPS IN EXISTING KNOWLEDGE XI. COUNTRY PROFILES XII. GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHY (highly selected and annotated where appropriate) XII.1. Lexica, encyclopedias, directories XII.2. Bibliographies, discographies, iconographies, etc. XII.3. Histories, monographs, periodicals, etc. IV Implementation Phases of Production The MLM project has three principal phases, devoted to the following: 1) working papers, 2) substantive writing, 3) editing. Working Papers: The first phase has been substantially completed, al- though all planned formats remain subject to emendation by the Board of Directors, often on the advice of special consultants or as a byproduct of dissemination to interested colleagues, including those in other disciplines. The coordinators of the seven main regions have each been asked to prepare three working papers: a. Inventory of existing documentation and identification of gaps b. Geocultural considerations for the region in question c. Table of Contents (or synopsis) for the volume(s) devoted to their region. Substantive Writing: We are currently embarked on the second phase - the writing of specific chapters - which is expected to take two or three years. Wherever possible, the writing will be done by scholars from the regions themselves. Selection of authors is being made by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the regional coordinators. Thus far, some twenty-five scholars have been commissioned. Each author writing on a specific theme is expected to make use of the guidelines where they are appropriate but expected also to feel free to include any other topics or concepts he or she considers germane to the culture involved. The chapters will be submitted to the appropriate regional coordinator and to designated specialists for comment and advice. Ultimate acceptance will rest with the Board od Directors. Such self-correcting mechanisms are essential to all phases of the project. The wjoint-inquiry* approach is pre- dicated on the expectation, justified by the history of science, that those mysterious &gt;cultural guidance systems&lt;, which appear to come into opera- tion when a certain number of minds address the same overarching questions, will function for a humanistic endeavor. 114</page><page sequence="13">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 Editing: The pulling together of the volumes will be an ongoing process that begins during the second (substantive writing) phase and continues for at least two subsequent years. The regional coordinators will be responsible for the initial integration of the accepted chapters and the shaping of their volume or volumes in general accordance with the guide- lines. An international panel of editors will complete this process and supervise the overall synthesis of the twelve volumes so that a cohesive whole can be achieved. Channels of Interaction: Simultaneously with the writing and editing phases a number of complementary activities are being organized: Regional Meetings: Special meetings bringing together scholars work- ing on the project in different regions are planned. They are designed to discuss problems, clarify issues, eliminate lacunae, and avoid duplication of effort. The first one occured in Kinshasa, Zaire, in February 1983. (Twenty-one musicologists from all over Africa attended - an unpre- cedented event.) The second and third, which took place in Stockholm, January and May of 1984, involved coordination of the work for Europe I, Europe II, and for the Soviet Asian Republics. Further regional meetings are planned during 1984-85 in Morocco, Mexico City, and Tokyo. Work in Progress Publications: These regional working papers (and more general supplementary studies) are being published in a series of MLM pamphlets subtitled Work in Progress. Four of these pamphlets have already appeared; others, in the offing, will also include drafts of the methodological essays planned for Volume I.5 World Inventory of Recorded Traditional Music (WIRTRAM): The International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) has given high priority to this inventory, which will cover public archives, private collections, radio/TV archives, commercially published discs, and cassettes. WIRTRAM is designed to answer the question: &gt;*Where do music recordings of a given people/ethnic group/music category, etc. exist?&lt;&lt; The inventory will also provide information on accessibility, technical medium, compiler and date of original collection, and availability of supporting documentation. All information will be computerized and may ultimately be adapted for a supplementary volume to the MLM project. Recordings: With the advice of WIRTRAM, a library of recorded illustrations will be assembled for issuance with the MLM volumes. Recordings will be carefully selected by authors and coordinators on the basis of their suitability to specific texts and their technical excellence. The UNESCO series will be used where possible, as will materials from public archives, private collections, and commercial catalogues. The most effective 5 &gt;Music in the Life of Man; a World History. Work in Progressr&lt;, Paris: IMC/ /UNESCO, 1983-1984. Vol. I, Asia and Oceania: part 1; vol. II, Africa: part 1; vol.

Organology: Special attention will be given to the major musical instruments of the world. Each will be defined, described, and illustrated with pictures and/or drawings. Classification data will include materials, measurements, performance techniques, musician's status, sociocontextual ambience, etc. The Royal Swedish Academy of Music will serve as a center for this activity. Bibliography: Each Author will provide a selective bibliography with his contribution. It will be briefly annotated where appropriate for specific items and represent the latest state of iknowledge on the given subject. Significant reference tools, other more complete bibliographies, disco- graphies, etc. should be included. The international and national centers of the Repertoire International de Litterature Musicale (RILM), see below, will provide assistance especially for recent publications. Lexicography: Contributors to MLM will be asked to define terms, concepts, and categories, giving transliteration from the original language and indication of pronunciation. Appendix A (vol. 20) to the New Grove Dictionary, &gt;&gt;an index of terms used in articles on non-Western music, folk music, and kindred topics&lt;, will be taken as a starting point. These definitions may be compiled in a glossary for inclusion in Volume XII of MLM or in a supplementary volume. Iconography: Photographs, drawings, maps, charts, and other visual materials (both in color and in black and white), will be prepared for inclusion in the volumes. The resources of the Repertoire International d'Iconographie Musicale (RIdIM) will be available (see below). Musical Notation: Modem staff notation will be employed where appropriate for the region. Alternative systems, when chosen for reasons specific to a culture, will be clearly explained. In general, a recorded example will be given preference to a written one (or used in conjunc- tion with it). Related Sources of Information MLM will be able to profit from the extensive experience and resources of a number of international projects organized through one or more International Member Organizations of the International Music Council. For example: 1. Repertoire International de Litterature Musicale (RILM), the world- wide computerized abstract journal covering all scholarly literature on music (books, articles, dissertations, etc.) that has appeared since 1967. 2. Repertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM), a vast and continuing bibliography in many volumes covering notated early music sources, both published and in manuscript. 3. Repertoire International d'Iconographie Musicale (RIdIM), a net- work of holdings, gathering and indexing reproductions of visual materials 116</page><page sequence="15">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 (painting, drawings, graphics, photographs) relating to music, with a view toward serving performers, teachers, musicologists, social historians, etc. 4. World Inventory of Sources of Music Information (WISMI), an IMC project realized thus far in only a few countries, designed to gather factual data internationally and nationally on all aspects of current musical life: agencies and foundations, public and private; education iand research; libraries, archives, and museums; performance groups, concert halls, opera houses; festivals, competitions, and congresses; the commercial music industry, including the media, publishers, copyists, music instrument manufacturers, trade unions, etc.; societies, associations, clubs; and publica- tions including periodicals. Conclusion - Point of Departure Labor on a set of volumes is what it is, only by virtue of its addressing a future set of volumes. If Music in the Life of Man and its eventual offspring can teach us anything, it is that, whether the creation being supplanted over time is a music, or a model of man making music, knowledge will grow and expres- sion deepen where continuity and experiment are not experienced as mutually exclusive. The game of paraphrase we played in our introduction gave birth to a statement, as we said, both grand and humbling in its implications. It is humbling because for our labors to address a future set of volumes means that they must engineer their own fall from grace - their own absolescence, as it were. It is grand enough, because for our labors to address those future MLM's, and be defined on the strength of that, means that la continuity of purpose is envisioned. A POSTSCRIPT The historiography of world music will be changed, perhaps quite radically, by the Music in the Life of Man project. What makes MLM special and unlike any other world history previously attempted is that it is being written &gt;from within-&lt; by outstanding scholars from the cultural regions themselves and edited by an international panel of experts. This project has stimulated interest on a world-wide scale to an extent that has never been seen before, involving people in the study of their own cultures in ways they have never attempted before. We have discovered a number of intriguing intercultural linkages, for example: there is an ancient melody well known in parts of southern India that is virtually identical to one sung today in Senegal, West Africa; it seems that the Sene- galese had migrated, hundreds of years ago, to their present homeland, from the East coast of Africa. And before that the tune had been trans- mitted there via the sea routes across the Indian Ocean. Now being studied by biologists and geneticists is another, quite amaz- ing set of linkages that seem to exist between parts of the Caucasus, Alba- nia, Sardinia, a corner of Basque territory, the Faroe Islands and some 117</page><page sequence="16">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 Berber tribes in North Africa. These cultures appear to have four char- acteristics that differ from those of the surrounding cultures: - they are all semi-nomadic herding cultures - they all employ a rather specific type of part singing (heterophony) - and they all have the same rare blood group distribution: low B, high 0 and high Rh-negative as well as a comparatively - low degree of lactose-intolerance or malabsorption. We expect that other such astonishing and mysterious connections will emerge as work progresses. What is the value of such a project? By its very nature, world music as a subject forces one to have recourse to many disciplines, to cross national and continental boundaries (although scholars who never do that can make valuable contributions). Why bother? Especially on such a grand scale? The answer is that the object of all humanistic inquiry is, or should be, to probe, to learn about, the nature of man and his relationship to the universe in which he lives, to achieve, as Eric Wolf puts it, ?an adequate understanding of the inter- connected world&lt;. In his brilliant book, Europe and the People without History, Wolf argued &gt;&gt;that the historical process is a complex interweaving of linkages and connections, that everybody's histories are intertwined, and that a re- cognition of this fact is commensurate with the world in which we live&lt;. This is precisely the assumption animating the Music in the Life of Man project. Wolf dealt with the same basic challenges as does MLM, i. e., what can be learned if we look at the world over time - as a whole, a totality, a system, instead of as a sum of self-contained societies and cultures. Wolf began from a very different perspective: he is an anthrop- ologist led perforce to divest himself of an ahistorical approach and we, music historians, no longer enjoying the luxury of being a-anthropological. Wolf undertook to delineate the general processes at work in mercan- tile and capitalist development while at the same time following their effects on the micropopulations studied by the ethnohistorians and the anthropologists. In other words when he chose to examine, say, the intercontinental fur trade rather than wars, monarchs, and mistresses, he was dealing with the kind of data that (1) languished beneath the notice of Establishment historians, and (2) crossed geocultural boundaries. By its very nature this data not only yielded insights into the perme- ability of boundaries between populations but also the permeability of boundaries between disciplines. No repertory of descriptive or analytic techniques staked out by any one branch of learning could adequately process this data: data relating to peoples and classes that usually fall between discipines or are rendered invisible by being cut up and parceled out among them. 118</page><page sequence="17">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 The conventional historian may have dealt cursorily with the fur trade and other similarly pedestrian matters. Wolf's signal achievement was to try to establish historical connections between the all-too-tangible, the daily round of trapping, skinning, curing, and seeling of pelts - and such momentous &gt;intangibles&lt; as the radical reordering of a tribe's kinship rules to adapt to the needs of the burgeoning fur trade. In doing so, he breaks down the division between what is considered for convenience to be &gt;intangible&lt; and *tangible&lt;, external and internal - making both tangible as history. With the Music in the Life of Man project we must deal with the obverse side of the problem: How to take a subject matter that suffers not from being &gt;beneath notice&lt; but from being, you might say, &gt;&gt;above notice&lt;. It has struck me that mainstream historians have given music short shrift if they mention it at all. The blinders worn by these scholars may represent a long-harbored identification of music solely with its masterpieces - these experienced as bounded, exalted, and fully integrated entities. It should be added that most music historians are constitutionally no more immune to such thinking than other western scholars. Given the non-representational nature of the art, it is easy to see these masterpieces as without connection to daily life. Given their status as interior creations and works of genius, it is tempting to further consider them somehow as &gt;not of this world&lt;. Ironic that Wolf, on the cutting edge of his discipline, also ignores music and the other arts as well. He argues that &gt;&gt;we will not understand the world we inhabit unless we combine and integrate economics, history, sociology, political science, and anthropology&lt;. He is right of course - but his list is incomplete! Could it be that he unreflectively shares his colleagues' tendencies to distance Music - Music with a capital &gt;M&lt;&lt; - from the world at large. If this is so, it is quite understandable that his program to retrieve the history of &gt;the people without history&lt; would not especially be drawn to music as a field of inquiry, insofar as music would be looked upon as the province of the &gt;victorious elites&lt; - rather than as a vital and ever-present aspect of human existence. One of the objectives of the MLM project will be to alter that picture radically by establishing a continuum and a connectedness between west- ern art music and all other musics - and between all music and the life of man. So, in contrast to Wolf's problem of elevating the pedestrian, ours is to take a phenomenon seen as all-to-intangible (if its neglect by historians is any gauge) and try to make it tangible as history by establishing its intimate interconnectedness with recorded or reconstructed aspects of daily life. Wolf's tentative solution was to seek out and &gt;*take cognizance of processes that transcend separable cases&lt;, which move &gt;through and beyond them... transforming them as they proceeds. With music, that 119</page><page sequence="18">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 kind of process is given to us time and time again in the subject matter at hand. That is, a music historian of any culture would not have to go far to find himself forced to deal with permeable boundaries between peoples, between disciplines, and, perhaps just as problematically, between the tangible and the intangible. To take an example from my own work in Western music: I was faced with the need to explain a musical phenomenon that happened to spring up in several countries at about the same time - around 1770. I am referring to the sudden eruption of an emotional intensity, use of minor keys, turbulent tremolos, and the re- exploration of contrapuntal techniques that occurred simultaneously in the very different musical environments of Paris and Vienna, lasting less than a decade. Its literary correlate in German letters was called the Sturm und Drang. And in Switzerland, Heinrich Fussli was busy painting demons. Confronted with different milieux, I initially sought for the changed attitudes toward what was permissible or desirable in compositional procedures - a set of intangibles perhaps loosely to be likened to the kin- ship rules that govern a tribal member's individual behavior - by establishing the most tangible of links. Did Simon Leduc, the Parisian composer, ever hear the Sturm und Drang symphonies of the young Haydn when he wrote his proto-romantic string trios? Had he read Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther? The explanation that I was able to arrive at, some steps beyond my first descriptive questions of contact and dissemina- tion, was that these apparently variegated phenomena were all precipitated by the widespread malaise felt by artist and bourgeois in a severely re- strictive society. This explanation of a given bunch of relationships that in every sense &gt;transcend separable boundaries&lt; would hardly have been possible had I not looked beyond my musicological nose. Geoculturally speaking, probably the most stubborn and ideologically rooted of our boundaries is that dividing objects and processes of the West from those of the rest of the globe. One might venture that the West viewed as a bounded, exalted, and fully integrated historical entity has itself taken on masterpiece status in its own eyes alongside its works of individual genius. A master-piece, in this caricatured sense, is that which is standard-setting, unassailable and basically unconnected to that which is arround it, except as a generator of value. One of the by- products of a global history of music may be to alter radically that limiting picture by establishing a continuum and a connectedness between western art music and all music on earth, and between all music and the life of man. The great promise of the Music in the Life of Man project may not, then, be the French Encyclopedists' rationalist dream of total coverage (quite clearly impossible in a subject matter whose hallmark is that it evades or spills over .all convenient bounds we wish to place around it) but rather the changed interfaces that result in our knowledge when we learn to read well into the kind of overarching processes of which Wolf speaks so eloquently. As we have seen, the interfaces thus changed involve not only the degree of permeability between peoples and regions, but between realms of experience - internal vs. external - and disciplines of study. 120</page><page sequence="19">REPORTS AND NEWS, IRASM 16 (1985), 1, 103-121 This last deserves a parting word: the nineteenth century saw a splintering of discipline that, as Wolf has taken pains to note, did not necessarily separate along natural fissures. Intellectual territory was staked out and resources mined as territories and resources often are: not always for the abstract reasons avowed; not always with the loftiest of purposes. The past few decades have seen a growing number of practitioners in these dis- ciplines become aware of their problem laden inheritance. The T&gt;border difficulties. that arose within and between disciplines when they under- took to address certain kinds of issues have been practically post-colonial in their confusion given the historically contingent, sometimes arbitrary, nature of the academic map. It is a very important shift indeed when matters are chosen for examination precisely because they question and threaten the integrity of the borders. The official name of the game in the generations directly preceding was to preserve such borders through programs of ever narrower and safer focus. Music - physical, biological, emotional, intellectual, spiritual; straddl- ing so many borders and so many kinds of borders - may well be the study of the next century most suited to challenge and to develop our increasingly integrative tools.
