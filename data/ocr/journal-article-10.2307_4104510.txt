THROUGH PRIOR GIFT OF MRS. GILBERT W. CHAPMAN, 2005 .424 Among Salvador Dalf's many memorable works, per- haps none is more deeply embedded in the popular imagination than Venus de Milo with Drawers, a half-size plaster reproduction of the famous marble (130-120 B.C.; Musde de Louvre, Paris), altered with pompon-decorated drawers in the figure's forehead, breasts, stomach, abdomen, and left knee. The provoking combination of cool painted plaster and silky mink tufts illustrates the Surrealist interest in uniting different elements to spark a new reality. For the Surrealists, the best means of pro- voking this revolution of consciousness was a special kind of sculpture that, as Dalf explained in a 1931 essay, was "absolutely useless ... and created wholly for the purpose of materializing in a fetishistic way, with maximum tangi- ble reality, ideas and fantasies of a delirious character."' Dalf's article, which drew upon the ideas of Marcel Duchamp's Readymades, inaugurated object making as an integral part of Surrealist activity. Dali was deeply influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud, contending "The only difference between immor- tal Greece and contemporary times is Sigmund Freud, who discovered that the human body, purely platonic in the Greek epoch, is nowadays full of secret drawers that only psychoanalysis is capable to open."2 The artist was especially interested in Freud's interpretation of William Jensen's Gradiva, a 1903 novel about an archaeologist's obsession with an ancient relief; this curiosity coincided with his first explorations on the theme of cabinets- works such as the intimately scaled Atmospheric Chair (i933), in which a small cabinet seems to give birth to a maelstrom of vaguely human body parts. In other works, like City of Drawers (1936), Dali transformed the cabinet into a female figure, or, as he put it, an "anthropomorphic cabinet."4 Venus de Milo with Drawers is the three- dimensional culmination of Dalf's explorations into the deep, psychological mysteries of sexual desire symbol- ized in the figure of the ancient goddess of love. While the artist showed Venus privately in 1936 and 1939, it remained in obscurity until the early 1960s, when the art dealer Max Clarac-Serou acquired it and made an edition of ten bronzes under Dali's supervision.5 Over the next twenty-five years, Dalf reconceived the sculpture in countless variations.6 While the unique 1936 plaster was first exhibited publicly in 1979, it had, in a Surrealist twist, already long enjoyed an iconic status thanks to its many proliferations.7 STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO 64</page><page sequence="2">?* ?2_? ,, r: i S~i ?, 1?: rf; t;~ s t ~-L ? ?-; 1 r; ?1. t-~ r- i :ct3~jyl;l:?: O : ? -~c~t;?r.-??; -? ?r ?1, r +;L~~ ?,I ~u; ~51 ~</page><page sequence="3">Shi Wang Ding, pp. 30-31. i.

In 1927 Mackintosh was asked to contribute to a series of articles on contem- porary English architecture. He declined, saying, "I cannot write about present day architecture in England because it does not exist." Quoted in Pamela Robertson, ed., The Chronycle: The Letters of Charles Rennie Mackintosh to Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, 1927 (Hunterian Art Gallery, 2001), p. 20. 2. It is not surprising that Mackintosh was a painter. He strongly believed in the Arts and Crafts "commune of all arts" and felt that the division between architec- ture, craft, and the fine arts was to blame for much that he regarded as bad and unoriginal in contemporary architectural work. 3.
