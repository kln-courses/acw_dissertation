      <p>Based on the BBC television series, <italic>Walking with Dinosaurs</italic> (as well as its prequel and sequel), this guide would more properly be entitled <italic>The Guide to Mostly Mesozoic Animal Life</italic>. It is pleasantly devoid of the anthropomorphism and storytelling that diluted the impact of the television series.</p>
      <p>The book is separated into three parts, namely the Mesozoic, before, and after. Each part is introduced with the important but standard geological overview that has become almost boilerplate in books on fossil organisms. Fortunately, the volume is not devoted to dinosaurs exclusively, and the authors should be credited for their efforts to include invertebrates and nondinosaurian taxa. Each organism is categorized by name, animal type, time period, size, diet, and broad locality range. Descriptions are prone to superlatives.</p>
      <p>In Part One and to some degree in Part Two, there is an unusual tendency to reconstruct environments as extremely dry, verging on Saharan in aridity. This is no doubt due to the propensity of the series to use such backgrounds in computer graphic melding of animation and real backgrounds. Throughout the book, the feet of terrestrial organisms frequently look like noncompliant blocks—lacking the squash of “squash and stretch” in animation or the weight‐bearing of support depending on your perspective. The authors make a valiant attempt to clear locality and phylogenetic perspectives, but it is a mixed bag. They are properly up to date on the theropod origin of feathers and birds, yet they are a quarter century behind on mammalian ancestors, still calling them mammal‐like reptiles as opposed to Synapsida.</p>
      <p>Highlighting all of animal evolution is not an easy task, so no single specialist will be satisfied. Indeed, a survey of colleagues generated a list of errors in virtually every section of the book. A second edition would benefit from reviews by specialists and coordination between text and caption editors. Despite the numerous criticisms, it is a visual tour de force, confirming that computer generated (CG)‐based reconstructions have justifiably joined the more traditional disciplines of sculpture, drawing, and painting in paleobiological art. In the end, it is visually impressive, but its textual potential remains unrealized. My five‐year‐old son loved the book, but he did not read it.</p>
