Printed in United States of America imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta: its promotion, distribution and reception Matthew H. Bernstein and Dana F. White In Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies &amp; Bucks, film historian Donald Bogle suggests that the Hollywood African-American screen jokers of the 1920s became the movie servants of the 1930s. Black performers in that decade, he argues, approached their work with an enthusiasm and talent that empowered them to transform menial roles and stereotypes into original and individualized charac terizations. In the process, Bogle asserts, African American performers challenged the white notion that all blacks look and act alike. By bringing something distinctive to each role that they created, the thirties generation transformed the films in which they acted. More than mere 'actors', they developed into 'nondi rectorial auteurs'.1 John Stahl 's Imitation of Ufe (1934) represents a key, if uneasy, marker in this transformation. Uni versal^ loose adaptation of a 1933 Fannie Hurst novel has been eclipsed by the better-known, more overtly ironic and widely available 1959 remake (fea turing Lana Turner and Juanita Moore) directed by Douglas Sirk. But the 1934 film was a prestige pro duction, a 'Stahl special' from the veteran director featuring white heartthrobs Claudette Colbert and Warren William, black actors Louise Beavers and Fredi Washington and a negative cost ($665,000) well above the studio average (and $100,000 over budget).2 As one writer in Atlanta's black newspaper the Daily World commented, 'It is elaborate'.3 Like this reporter, other reviewers and audi ences recognized Imitation of Life as an extraordinary film. It was innovative in a number of ways. The script made it one of the first Hollywood studio films to portray black characters seriously, not as comic sidekicks or musical specialties or as slaves. It imag ined a sisterly, if unequal, bond between black and white single mothers. More specifically, it portrayed a dignified if passive black mother in Delilah (Lousie Beavers) and seriously portrayed the plight of her light-skinned daughter Peola (Fredi Washington) who desires to pass in white society.4 It also featured extraordinary examples of Bogle's cardinal principle and a mainstay of criticism in studio era films about African-Americans: it boasts two black actors tran scending their flatly scripted roles. Even the film industry trade press and major white northeastern newspapers expressed surprise at the power of Bea vers' and Washington's performances. At the same time, the film's popularity with black audiences is well-known: Imitation of Life was a cultural event, a watershed. Bogle notes that 'Black ministers preached sermons about it while black intellectuals wrote about the film as well'.5 As he and Anna Everett have shown, the film played sold out shows for black audiences while the black press celebrated these actors' achievements. In some in stances, individual critics, black and white, provided keen critiques of the film's racial politics for their 1934 readers.6 Matthew H.

No one has discussed the film's reception in the South, black or white. Industry reviewers repeatedly declined to say whether Imitation of Life would play well there, or even be allowed to be shown. As Susan Courtney has argued, Peola's light skin and ability to pass as white threatened to demolish the entire concept of race as a readily visible physical trait, the very basis for discrimination against blacks.7 Beyond that fun damental challenge to Jim Crow practices, the film's intimate relationship between Delilah and her white employer Bea (Claudette Colbert) - and the two mothers' parallel heartbreak at the hands of their daughters - bordered on a positive representation of social equality between the races, something unac ceptable and absurd, if not subversive, in the South of the 1930s. Moreover, Peola's impassioned and compelling protest against racial inequality - a cru cial element of the film's appeal to some black audi ences - would likely give offense as a critique of Jim Crow customs and blacks' second-class citizenship across the country. This essay begins to fill out the picture of southern reception of this landmark film by examin ing Imitation of Life's initial playoff in Atlanta, where it was shown first in a white movie palace with black segregated seating at the very top of its balcony, and then in black-only theaters. While segregated exhibi tion is not news, we use Imitation of Life's white and black Atlanta premieres as a way of understanding how Jim Crow segregation worked in the film indus try's distribution practices within a southern city. Moreover, in comparing white and black press cov erage of the film, we find that different critics at the black Atlanta Daily World, as elsewhere, would praise and critique different aspects of the film. But we argue that the comments in black Atlanta's daily newspapers arose from a distinctive southern black sensibility that was heavily influenced by the exist ence of a well-educated, solid black middle-class in the city. The segregated plots and their integration In narrative terms, one could - and newspaper ad vertising and critics in Atlanta often did - segregate the two plot lines of Imitation of Life into those con cerning its white and black characters. The white plot follows a Horatio Alger trajectory of an impoverished white widow and single parent Bea Pullman (Col bert), who as we see in the film's opening scene is overwhelmed by her business and maternal respon sibilities - bathing daughter Jessie before nursery school, cooking breakfast, and handling business calls about the maple syrup she sells. As Jessie (Rochelle Hudson) grows, Bea is utterly devoted to her and spoils her. Only when Bea becomes wealthy through the mass production of pancake batter mix does she allow herself to fall in love with ichthyologist (marine scientist) Stephen Archer (Warren William). Ironically, while home from boarding school for a visit, Jessie spends a great deal of time with Stephen and, since Stephen and Bea keep their romance a secret from her, falls in love with him. In a grand gesture typical of maternal melodrama, an an guished Bea ultimately cancels her engagement with Stephen, anticipating that Jessie would always re sent their union. She surrenders her romantic happi ness - a sacrifice magnified by the loveless nature of her previous marriage to Jessie's father - so that nothing comes between her and her daughter. In the film's extended opening sequence, Bea takes in an African-American single mother Delilah (Louise Beavers), whose story constitutes the film's black plot (the fate of Delilah's husband is not speci fied). Delilah arrives at Bea's back door by accident and finds her unable to juggle all her responsibilities. She insists on joining Bea's household as a live-in domestic in return for room and board for herself and daughter Peola (played as an adult by Fredi Wash ington). Parallel to Bea's anguish with Jessie, the wt CLAUDETTE COLBERT ll?llTftTIOn OF LIFE m Fig. L'Once a pancake, always a pancake.'

Delilah rubs Bea's feet. [All further illustrations from collection of the authors.] light-skinned Peola causes her mother heartbreak, since she desperately desires to 'pass' as white, and rages against her dark-skinned mother and against segregated life in general. After Delilah foils Peola's early attempt to pass in a white elementary school classroom and a later effort to pass in a 'white job' as a coffee shop cashier, the distraught adult daugh ter begs her mother not to seek her out any longer. Peola rejects and abandons Delilah to cross the colour line. With this inconsolable loss forced upon her, the helpless and uncomplaining Delilah dies of an unspecified ailment. Peola comes remorsefully back to her mother's funeral and accepts her black identity by agreeing to attend a black college in the South. Yet characterizing Imitation of Life as simply bifurcated along racial lines fails to do it justice, for the film is unique for its time in portraying two mothers - one black, the other white - sharing the challenges of poor single parenthood as they struggle together against the financial exigencies of the Depression. The two women develop an unmistakably strong relationship. In the end, however, the distance be tween employer and employee, white and black re mains fixed. As Susan Courtney has shown, even the visualization of the two women is bifurcated, with Bea photographed constantly in motion with dynamic camera movement and Delilah framed in static shots that visually suggest her social immobility: she is as fixed as the 'Aunt Delilah' logo on their pancake mix box and advertising signs.8 If poverty binds the two women together across racial lines, they stay together after they've | made their fortune - at Delilah's insistence. In an infamous scene, she informs Bea and their business manager Elmer (the nasal but kindly Ned Sparks) that five years into their overwhelming success, Delilah is uninterested in her twenty percent holdings in the Aunt Delilah Pancake Company and wishes to stay on, take care of Bea and Jessie, and live in their new lavish home. Speaking of her secret family pancake recipe, Delilah tells Bea, 'I makes you a present of it, Honey'. She begs Bea, 'Please don't send me away', to which the business-wise Elmer comments, 'Once a pancake, always a pancake' (Fig. 1). Delilah's character is clearly molded in the Mammy, 'faithful retainer' formula of southern fiction, and happy to work without any compensation beyond room, board, and proximity to the white family. She is not only loyal but childlike (she cannot keep a secret such as her pancake recipe and she clings supersti tiously to her rabbit's foot), and she is disinterested and oblivious to money and what it can do for her (first suggested when she persuades Bea to let her work for room and board). She defines herself exclu sively as a caretaker, whose domestic skills, as Jeremy Butler has indicated, facilitate Bea's financial success and romantic happiness.9 Universal's film makers may have surmised that were Delilah to de mand a greater share of the corporation's stock, reaction in the North as well as the South would have resulted in severe cuts, if not a boycott of the film.10 In the film, Delilah is not in a position to demand anything. So Bea and Delilah, united in their poverty and then their wealth, eventually share maternal mis ery as well. The most dramatic contrast in the film is between Delilah's acceptance of a subordinate role in life and Peola's demands for equality. While the film alternates between the problems of white and black single mothers and their daugh ters, after the women become rich, Imitation of Life also alternates between melodrama and screwball comedy. During the lengthy sequence of Bea's night time soiree at her Sutton Place townhouse, complete with a view of the 59th Street Bridge, Stephen Archer arrives for the first time and unknowingly insults his hostess as they dance. These scenes of light roman tic comedy alternate with those downstairs between Delilah and the inconsolable adult Peola, who broods over her desire to be white and to join parties like the one above. As this sequence underlines, arbitrary racial hierarchies remain in place. After the soiree, Bea and Delilah confer about the evening's events, and Delilah gives Bea advice on her love life while | she rubs Bea's feet as she used to do when they were</page><page sequence="4">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 155 poor (Fig. 2). They say goodnight in a shot emblem atic of the film's racial politics: Bea retires to her upstairs bedroom which we never see, and Peola slowly goes downstairs to hers (Fig. 3). Although a landmark film in the portrayal of African-Americans, Imitation of Life could only go so far towards human izing its black characters. Production code concerns Still, through the anguish of Peola, Imitation of Life was without question Hollywood's most nuanced and careful examination of the unhappiness of sub ordinated African-American life. This dynamic had been apparent to Production Code Administration head Joseph Breen who, early in 1934, initially re jected the project out of hand because Peola's light skin indicated miscegenation in her family's past. Such a backstory violated the Code's prohibition against miscegenation, but Code provisions aside, it was also, as Breen informed Universal officials and his own staff in early March 1934, bad business practice.11 Breen eventually relented on prohibiting the film's production, but prior to principal photography his assistants emphasized other potential trouble spots with the story, recognizing the script's sugges tion that the unhappiness experienced by Delilah and Peola could be read as an indictment of Jim Crow custom. For example, one associate, J.B. Lewis, noted that Peola's 'desire to mix with whites con stantly brings into sharp relief the prejudice against the black race', precisely a major concern for the film's distribution in the South. Lewis also noted Bea's hypocrisy and Deliah and Peola's utter misery: At no time does Bea, the white woman, and her daughter give proper credit to the fortune which they have made on the negro mother's recipe for flapjacks. And the two negroes con tinue to appear somewhat downtrodden throughout the plot. It may have been the author's intent to show that the negroes were happiest as servants in the house but this is not clearly brought out.12 This obviously perceptive assistant discussed these retained elements of the story, as well as the frequent use of the term 'nigger' in the dialogue and a plot line that at this point included the near-lynching of a young black male character. Both were elimi nated from the script (the 'n' word omitted reportedly at Louise Beavers' and the NAACP's insistence). But one of Breen's associates, Alice Field, recognized the dilemma the filmmakers faced, whereby their most compelling storyline would also be the least acceptable to certain audiences: The only really gripping and dramatic thread in the story is that of Peola's anguish and her old mother's heartbreak over the whole miserable, unsolvable situation. With this element of the story removed the rest would become colour less - and yet it is difficult to see how such a theme can be acceptably presented on the screen. It is all embedded in such deep-lying emotional feeling, coloured by race hatred and race sympathy that it would seem to me to offer quite a serious problem. True it treats the problem with all possible kindness and understanding but the spot touched is such a sore one that it would seem the kindest thing of all to do as little probing thereabouts as possible.13 This punning assistant ('colourless') went to the extent of imagining alternative storylines, wonder ing whether Peola could die early on so the filmmak ers could focus on the two women's close bond, with Delilah as Bea's droll sidekick, full of folk wisdom. She concluded by noting that 'As written, however, the dark thread of Peola's tragedy seems to dwarf everything else'. Once completed, the film sustained the compelling thread of Delilah and Peola's unhap piness, and critics duly noted it.

Searching for Peola, Delilah and Bea share the back seat. nized these delicate aspects of their story beyond the evidence of the finished film. There we find a carefully restrained treatment of the Delilah-Peola subplot, with 'as little probing thereabouts as possible' on the passing issue beyond presenting it as a source of unhappiness. Moreover, in many of its details, the film displays a heightened sensitivity to racial issues unprecedented in Hollywood films of the time. The music selected and spotted for the film is one exam ple. The famous semi-spiritual 'Nobody Knows the Troubles I've Seen' plays initially over the opening credits, but it comes to be associated with Delilah; we hear the song again as a transitional device after the scene in which Bea and Delilah discuss her twenty percent stake in the Aunt Delilah Pancake Company; and we hear it once more after Bea's final scene with Jessie, during the closing credits, as if to insist that Delilah hovers over their future lives. There are also surprising if ephemeral bits of staging to imply social equality: Delilah sits in the back seat of Bea's limousine with Bea when they search for Peola, even if Delilah is in the front seat when they return to New York (Figures 4-5). Moreover, Peola is in the front seat in the funeral car at the end while Bea and Jessie sit in back; she really does assume her 'place' relative to white society here and in her agreement to attend a black college. Even the use of an Asian customer - a gratuitous bit of extra casting - in the boardwalk restaurant where Bea first meets business manager Elmer appears to present-day eyes as em blematic of a storytelling sensibility that goes beyond using 'the race problem' simply as a way to differen tiate this maternal melodrama from all the others. The filmmakers' awareness of the significance of their subject is most evident, finally, in the powerful per formances which Beavers and Washington provide as Delilah and Peola. At the same time, one Hurst biographer as serts that many changes Stahl and his collaborators made in adapting the novel were concessions to its anticipated, troubled reception on the race issue. These included the placement of Delilah's room in the basement of their Manhattan townhouse. But most of them concerned Peola. Her love interest was removed (in the novel she marries a white engineer and sterilizes herself so he will never discover her true identity). Her remorse at her mother's funeral was invented (in the novel, she moves with her husband to Bolivia and never learns about her mother's death). And her off-screen agreement to attend a (black, implicitly) college in the South, as Bea and Delilah had wished, was yet another alteration.14 Even Hurst herself admitted to readers of Opportunity that 'there are many aspects of [the film adaptation] that fall short or deviate or even malign my original theme'.15 She may well have also had in mind the changes the filmmakers made to the white storyline - in which Jessie runs off with Bea's younger love interest - for these also helped to make the film a more typical maternal melodrama. But where Bea has the power to make things right with her daughter, Delilah is powerless to reconcile with or even please hers. Initial reviews in the trade and New York press Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, Motion Picture Daily and Motion Picture Herald all reviewed Imitation of Life favorably as a genre film, but they singled out the black storyline and Louise Beavers' and Fredi Wash ington's performances as superlative.16 The Re porter's full review praised Stahl's direction because 'All the negro sequences are so remarkably well done with such a brilliant insight into the relationship be tween negroes and white folks'.17 Variety's critic sin gled out Washington's 'excellent' performance in the funeral scene and devoted a remarkable paragraph to Beavers: 'Picture is stolen by the Negress, Louise Beavers, whose performance is masterly. This lady can troupe. She took the whole scale of human emotions from joy to anguish and never sounded a false note. It is one of the most unprecedented per sonal triumphs for an obscure performer in the an | nais of a crazy business.'18 Similarly, the Hollywood</page><page sequence="6">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta ^ 157 Reporter flatly pronounced that 'Louise Beavers, as Delilah, gives one of the great performances of the year. It is definitely her picture from an acting angle and the audience sympathy her role arouses.'19 The consistency in the trade press' positive response to the film was shared more broadly in the industry, as the film was nominated for Best Picture for the Acad emy Awards that year (it lost to Frank Capra's smash hit, It Happened One Night)20 But equally of note in the trade press is the attention and praise given to the film's black plot and to Beavers/Delilah. These elements would be completely ignored in Atlanta's white newspaper reviews; they provided food for thought in the Atlanta Daily World and other black papers. Imitation of Life premiered as a success in New York in late November 1934, where it broke two year-old ticket sales records at the huge Roxy Thea ter.21 White New York City newspaper critics had mixed reactions to what everyone recognized as a 'woman's picture'; the chief criticism was that the film tried to do too much. The New York Times's Andre Sennwald described Imitation of Life as a 'diffuse' film 'which discussed the mother love question, the race question, the business woman question, the mother and daughter question, and the love renunciation question'. Of them all, he felt, the 'race question promised to be the most interesting, but the photo play was content to suggest that the sensitive daugh ter of a Negro woman is bound to be unhappy if she happens to be able to pass for white'. While praising the cast, Sennwald described director John Stahl's 'sincerity' as unable 'to conceal the shallowness of the play's ideas, the commonplace nature of its emotions, nor the rubber-stamp quality of its writ ing'.22 The Evening Post and World-Telegram concur red that the film had too many storylines to do justice to any one. For these critics, perhaps, the romantic comedy subplot between Bea and Stephen seemed just formulaic and distracting. By contrast, Regina Crewe and Edwin Schallert in the New York American agreed that Imitation of Life was a powerful drama; they praised Hurst and the filmmakers for effectively combining the white and black plots and for not attempting to solve the race question - i.e. for tread ing lightly on the subject. Few national newsweeklies reviewed the film. Yet two which did likewise differed in their estimation of the film's achievement and its treatment of race relations. In Liberty magazine, 'Beverly Hills' raved that this was Universal's best film since 1930's Acad emy Award-winning All Quiet on the Western Front. Hills thought Claudette Colbert gave her 'finest per formance', but saved the strongest praise for Fredi Washington, whose role was 'so daring and pathetic that it is unforgettable ... Cultured and wealthy, her personal problem is the problem of thousands of educated Afro-Americans. Universal's treatment of this mass tragedy will cause Imitation of Life to be drastically edited, if not banned, in the Southern States. If so, it will be the South's loss.'23 By contrast, the Literary Digest's critic singled out the clich?s of Bea and Jessie's dilemma. This reviewer also com mented on the politics of the film's subtle condem nation of Peola, and the ways in which the sympathetic portrayal of Delilah's heartbreak could backfire: The real story, the narrative which is merely hinted at, never really contemplated, is that of the beautiful and rebellious daughter of the loyal Negro friend. She is light-skinned, sensi tive, tempestuous; she grows bitterly indignant when she sees that the white girl with whom she has been reared is getting all the fine things of life while she is subjected to humili ation and unhappiness. Obviously she is the most interesting person in the cast. Her drama is the most poignant, but the producers not only confine her to a minor and carefully handled subplot, but ap pear to regard her with a bit of distaste. They appear to be fond of her mother, because she is of the meek type of old-fashioned Negro I i ------ - . .

Thereupon they scold her for break ing her mother's heart by her rebelliousness, even tho [sic] to some it may seem that the mother had a way of forcing herself on her daughter which must have upset the nerves of the tragically neurotic girl....The film takes so much time to sidestep its real theme that Imi tation of Life is excessively long, despite some good comedy interludes. In the small role of the Negro daughter, the part which should have dominated the picture, Fredi Washington is vital, straightforward, and splendidly in earnest.24 As we will see below, several black critics of the film shared these views of the film's half-hearted treatment of Peola and its patronizing portrait of Delilah. Critics like Variety's white reviewer hoped that Imitation of Life might 'make some slight contribution to the cause of greater tolerance and humanity in the racial question'. Many reviewers predicted trouble for the film in the South or declined to even 'judge' or 'guess' at its 'reception in the South'.25 Certainly, the Breen Office had been aware of such potential of fense; one staffer had speculated that 'in some lo calities this picture would incite new racial prejudices and might lead, in some instances, to open hostil ity'.26 Yet the film apparently did reasonably well, in the white South as well as the North, upsetting con ventional industry wisdom that only the most reac tionary depictions of race relations would please those 'south of the Mason-Dixon line'. Universal found, as if in answer to the trade press's speculation concerning its regional appeal, that the film out grossed Only Yesterday - the 1933 Stahl melodrama starring Margaret Sullavan as an unwed mother - in several southern cities: Charleston, South Carolina; Charlotte, North Carolina; Little Rock, Arkansas; Lou isville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Norfolk and Richmond.Virginia; and San Antonio, Texas. Imitation of Life also out-performed Frank Borzage's Little Man, What Now? - again starring Sullavan with Douglass Montgomery as a poor couple in post World War I Germany - in Baltimore, Maryland; Dal las and Houston, Texas; and in New Orleans, Louisi ana.27 Imitation of Life's box office in Atlanta, however, did not exceed that of the other films with which its playoff had been compared.</page><page sequence="8">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 159 Imitation of Life's Atlanta debut In Atlanta, Imitation of Life played a conventional one-week opening run, from 7 to 13 December 1934, at the 'Fabulous Fox' Theater, a 4500 seat house on the city's main thoroughfare Peachtree St., a mile north of Atlanta's downtown where most movie pal aces were congregated. Ticket sales at the Fox may have been diminished by moviegoers' perception that this was just another female weepie. But white audience interest was likely strengthened by movie ads and reviews that made no mention of the Afri can-American plotline and stars. The Fox Theater promoted the film with an ad featuring the image of an earring-ed, smiling Claudette Colbert, a drawing of the novel, and ad copy that stressed Bea's heart breaking story, using Universal's suggested tagline, beginning with 'A tremendous drama of mother and daughter who loved the same man!' (Fig. 6).28 The Constitution's first brief item about the film stressed its diverse appeals, including Ned Sparks' 'comic irony', and describes the film's exposition in this way: 'Claudette Colbert begins the show in the role of a poor young widow with a baby girl, showing the effort she makes to carry on a meager business of ped dling which her husband started before his death. The nurse who enters early in the show also has a young girl who, with her mother, play a splendid supporting role.'29 The column concludes that The show offers entertainment truly different from any thing that has shown in Atlanta for some time and should be a welcome variation for Atlanta theatergo ers'. It never specified what that variation might be - and that it involved 'the nurse', and that 'the nurse' was black. The Constitution's preview, in other words, completely dismissed the very elements of the film which the Breen Office, the trade press and the northern reviewers agreed was the film's most compelling and troublesome aspect of the film - Delilah and Peola's story. The longest piece about the film, appearing in the Sunday edition of the Atlanta Constitution, took its first three paragraphs from the 13 October Universal Weekly, the studio's publicity publication: 'What would you do if you were a widow who had fallen desperately in love for the first time in your life and were planning on an early marriage to the man of your heart, only to find that your 16-year-old daughter, ignorant of the true situation, had fallen no less desperately in love with the same man?'.30 The Con stitution piece then discussed the white stars. In fact, its only allusions to any other sub-plot of the film were its acknowledgment that the foregoing was 'only one of the several poignant problems presented in Imita tion of Life', and its listing of Louise Beavers among other cast members. Otherwise, race remained un mentioned. This 'review', instead, stressed Hurst's authorship of the popular Back Street and the re teaming of Colbert and Warren Williams after their appearance in Cecil B. DeMille's Cleopatra earlier that same year. Coverage of the film in the Atlanta Journal was identical, consisting of the same press book copy which served as a 'review' of the film in the Sunday edition, the same ads, and the same lack of references to the film's black characters and sto ryline. The Fabulous Fox's manager likely aimed to capitalize on Colbert's popularity to sell the film, especially after the unprecedented four week run of It Happened One Night earlier in 1934. But that pos sible motivation would not preclude mentioning Imi tation of Life's black plot and characters; the film's depiction of racial interdependence had to be a factor as well. Interestingly, other, later Hollywood films with prominent black characters were adver tised by mentioning black stars. Less than two months after Imitation of Life's Atlanta debut, the Will Rogers vehicle The County Chairman was promoted with a large ad featuring the star foremost (in the largest type and with his face), but with Stepin Fetchit's name in the same size as the two other supporting white actors who form the romantic sub plot (Fig. 7); in small weekday ads, in fact, Fetchit's was the only other name to appear with Rogers' (Fig. 8).31 Undoubtedly, this had to do with the popularity of the established comedy teaming of Rogers and Fetchit in previous films such as Judge Priest (1934); it also had much to do with the comic genre in which they worked, which would mitigate the threat of 'so cial equality' between the races by situating Fetchit as Rogers' comic sidekick.

Imitation of Life, some white Atlantans who saw the film at the Fox might well have been surprised to see the Delilah-Peola story have such prominence in the film, or to unfold in the film at all. Nothing in the Atlanta newspapers about the film would have prepared them for it. The absence of Louise Beavers from Atlanta's white newspapers for Imitation of Life is even more striking when we consider Universal's advertising tie-in with the promotion of Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour, which appeared during the film's one-week run. An Atlanta Journal ad on the day of the film's opening showed Claudette Colbert smiling in profile and pouring syrup on a stack of pancakes; its head line had the Paris-born Colbert saying 'We'se in town, honey', and stressed that when Universal wanted to make pancakes for the film's action, they used Aunt Jemima's mix, which included besides four types of flour, 'other ingredients, jealously guarded in a life of service in the Old South' (Fig. 9).32 The ad echoes, or anticipates, Delilah's claim that her recipe for pancakes is a family secret. The ad likewise obliquely references Beavers' appearance in the film with an Aunt Jemima logo in its lower right corner. But Louise Beavers, the film's 'Aunt Jemima', is absent. By pro moting Colbert's particular brand of domesticated glamour over the film's direct identification of Bea vers as an Aunt Jemima figure, the ad essentially replicates Bea's appropriation of Delilah's family se cret recipe. As with the white newspaper ads and reviews of Imitation of Life, race was completely left out of the picture. If Imitation of Life's box office performance in the white Atlanta Fox Theater remained just average, by mid-December, it was racking up significantly better-than-average figures in Boston, Detroit, Michi gan and San Francisco, and remained the top-gross ing film for three weeks in Buffalo, New York and Los Angeles.33 This success would be matched, and even exceeded, in the black sides of major cities like Atlanta, where the film's distribution, promotion and reception would be of a totally different order. Run/Zone/Clearance and Imitation of Ufe in Atlanta Historians understand a typical pattern for distribut ing a major studio film within a major city during the studio era.34 The film would typically appear first in a downtown movie palace, often one owned by the major studios, with the biggest seating capacity (over 1500 seats), highest ticket prices (upwards of a dol lar), and the finest amenities (carpets, ushers, elabo rate proscenia and decor). The film would then disappear for a month or two, and then turn up at a neighborhood theater for just a few days. This sec ond run theater would seat just a few hundred cus tomers and be less lavish in appointments; accordingly, it would charge far less for tickets. The film would appear around town subsequently for two or three play dates. In Atlanta, sometimes, the film would turn up on two or three screens simultaneously in short runs of two to three days. In all cities, a film radiated out over several months from the central downtown district to less central neighborhoods and suburbs, where there was less money to be made. These theaters, not surprisingly, were not owned by major Hollywood companies, but by smaller compa nies or even individuals. In all theaters, the popularity of a film could be measured impersonally and exter</page><page sequence="10">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 161 nally by the length of its run, particularly in the first run houses, and the frequency with which it was rebooked into subsequent run theaters. For exam ple, Frank Capra's It Happened One Night caused a great deal of comment in Atlanta, because its Febru ary 1934 run extended well beyond the standard one-week booking to three additional weeks. The run/zone/clearance system just described assumes a uniformly white city with white theaters, whether or not they featured separate seating for African Americans. The segregated nature of Atlanta theater-going, however, raises the question of how the existence of completely separate or 'race thea ters' in the American South affected Hollywood dis tribution patterns. Significantly, in Atlanta, following its standard one-week run at the first-run Fox, Imita tion of Life appeared in two of the city's black theaters nearly two weeks before it appeared in any of its white, second-run houses. Imitation of Life began its black run five weeks after its white first-run had ended, on Sunday, 20 January, at the Bailey's Royal Theater. This was situated in the Auditorium Addition to the Odd Fel lows Building, an office complex celebrated at its official dedication in 1913 by Booker T. Washington as 'a landmark in Negro progress ... worth a trip to Atlanta for any coloured man to see'. The house first opened as the Pioneer Theater in 1914. It was re named The Auditorium in 1917, and became the Paramount Theater in 1924, and the Royal in 1930. From its beginnings, until its sale to the white-owned Bailey Theater chain, the Auditorium was black owned and black-managed. Even after the transfer of ownership, it continued under black management through the late 1950s. The theater finally closed in 1971, almost a decade after the desegregation of public facilities citywide. The pride of Auburn Avenue, the heart of Black Atlanta's commercial district, the Royal Theater, under its various designations ca tered to the city's black elite by featuring Hollywood dramatic films, as well as such 'race film' productions as those of Oscar Micheaux, Richard Norman, and later, Spencer Williams.35 Imitation of Life ran at the Royal for five days, and then moved cross-town to the recently-opened Bailey's New Ashby Theater, which also served so phisticated moviegoers from the Atlanta University Center and middle-income West Side black subur banites. There, due to popular demand, the film was extended twice, by two days each, before leaving the theater. Five days later, the film began its white neighborhood runs at the 10th St. and Alpha Thea ters. In black Atlanta, Imitation of Life's fourteen con secutive days of booking was, on its own scale, analogous to 1934's It Happened One Nights four weeks. Both were unprecedented. The usual length of a first-run film in the black Atlanta theaters was two to three days. Broadway Bill, Frank Capra's next film after It Happened One Night, for example, premiered at Bailey's Theater 81 for three days in mid-February 1935 and next appeared at the Ashby for three days in March. Hence even the initial run of Imitation of Life at the Royal, lasting five days, was unusually long for this period, as was the film's run at the Ashby Theater for another consecu tive five days, which was in turn twice extended by two days. Imitation of Life's box office performance in Black Atlanta matched the film's success in black theaters in other cities, such as New York. In Chi cago, it was held over for a second week to standing room only crowds.36 At no time during this two-week period in which Imitation of Life played in Atlanta's race theaters did the film show up in white second-run or neighbor hood houses. After its white second-run showings in February, the film returned to race theaters, but only months and months later - in May for an unusual four day-run at the Bailey's Theater 81 - simultaneous with a three day run at the white (with a segregated black balcony) Empire Theater. (Two prints showing simultaneously was in 1935 a benefit of Atlanta's being a major film distribution exchange city for the southeast.) No film showed more frequently in Bailey's race theaters in 1935: Imitation of Life re turned for one and two-day runs to the Royal Theater again in June, the New Lincoln Theater in August and the New Harlem Theater in September (Fig. 10). This distribution pattern, and that of other films released during the 1934-1935 year, indicates that the run/zone/clearance system accommodated race theaters as if they were located in an entirely different city - as, in a sense, they were. Few white Atlantans would consider seeing a Hollywood film in a race theater (midnight rambles aside). Like Imitation of Life, other films of the period with prominent black characters and performers - such as Fox's Judge Priest, featuring Stepin Fetchit alongside Will Rogers -would also show in race theaters after appearing in white first-run theaters but before their runs at white subsequent-run theaters. This pattern could even apply to some 1935 films that didn't feature black performers, such as MGM's classic adaptation David</page><page sequence="11">162 Matthew H. Bernstein and Dana F.

Copperfield, Warner Bros.' coal miner union mes sage movie Black Fury, Paramount's Mae West com edy Goin' to Town, and Frank Capra's Broadway Bill racetrack yarn (with Clarence Muse in the cast).37 If anything, the month-long clearance between Imitation of Life's Atlanta premiere at the Fox and its black premiere at the Royal was longer than usual. For example, Frank Capra's Broadway Bill premiered at the Theater 81 on 11 February 1935, just ten days I after its white premiere run ended at the Rialto in downtown Atlanta (1 February); Paramount's Col lege Rhythm likewise appeared within two weeks of its white premiere. While a four week gap in white and black movie premieres was not unheard of at this time (e.g. Black Fury premiered at the Theater 81 on 16 July 1935, while its white premiere run at the Georgia Theater ended 21 June), the four week racial clearance for Imitation of Life may have been required to in fact secure a new print from Hollywood. An article previewing the film's run at the Royal Theater boasted that the version shown there would be un cut, unlike the version shown at the Fox. No details were given as to which scenes or lines of dialogue were cut from the Fox screenings.38 As our list of other film examples demon strates, the distribution pattern of black theater screenings in between the first and second white theater runs also applied to films from nearly all the major producer-distributors (Universal, Fox, RKO, Paramount, M-G-M, Columbia, etc.). This is not sur prising - if we consider that after such films played in the first run theaters, the distributors had collected the bulk of their receipts. It likely made little difference to the distribution executives at the major studios where the films played next, unless independent exhibitors of second and third-run houses com plained that the black side was getting the films in advance of their theaters. Apparently, in Atlanta, sec ond and third-run white theater managers had no problem with this arrangement, as it did not affect their ticket sales to white customers, most of whom had no reason or occasion to notice what took place across the colour line. In the Atlanta Daily World, however, black Atlantans were constantly encour aged to take note of the films playing in white theaters with segregated seating and in the 'race' theaters in black Atlanta neighborhoods. This was just one ex ample of black Atlanta's thriving movie fan culture in the first half of the 1930s. Imitation of Life in Atlanta's Daily World Obviously, Imitation of Life's frequent bookings into Atlanta's race theaters came about because of the film's undeniably powerful black subplot and Bea vers' and Washington's intense performances. Both this compelling theme and the film's stars would inevitably generate extensive coverage for the film in the Atlanta Daily World, another black-owned and operated enterprise, situated only a few blocks west along 'Sweet Auburn' from the Royal Theater. Not surprisingly, in contrast to the white Atlanta newspa pers' routine treatment of Imitation as a female weepie, the Da/7y World paid special attention to its race plot with more original reviews than to any other film of the 1930s - including Gone With the Wind (1939). And the Daily World ads and articles, in a mirror image of the white papers' treatment, fore grounded the black cast and storyline over the white leads. To appreciate the unusual quality of the pa per's response to Imitation of Life, it is worth noting that typically, Daily World 'reviews', like those in At lanta's white newspapers, were taken wholesale out of studio press books with the local theater name plugged in. By-lined reviews by staff writers ap peared only on rare occasions. In this black newspa per, as in others, the movie page functioned as what film historian Anna Everett has called 'an extension of Hollywood's promotional machine', a mix of 'indi vidual critics remarks and information lifted from Hollywood press releases'.39 With Imitation of Life,</page><page sequence="12">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 163 the Daily World of course published several publicity I items from black wire services about the film's pro duction earlier in the year. More significantly, that publicity intensified during the film's runs in Atlanta and culminated in some highly original critical com mentaries from local writers. There was a notable shift in the responses to the film over time. The general tenor of the early news items and articles was to celebrate straightforwardly the film's landmark focus on black American life. Later articles proved to be extremely thoughtful pieces with more profound analysis of the film's racial politics and its consequent strengths and weaknesses as a 'realistic' portrayal of the African-American experience circa 1934. When Imitation of Life began its one-week run at the Fox, the Daily World promoted it via wire stories about its production - to build up interest before its black premiere in town, but also on the assumption some readers would climb the steps to the segre gated section of the Fox's balcony. One black resi dent who did make that climb was Daily World sportswriter Ric Roberts. Roberts began by conced ing that in writing a film review, he had strayed far from his usual beat: 'Now, to those of you who have followed me in this sports writing persuasion, this aesthetic attempt may read below par or shallow'. But Roberts was still ready to tell readers that the film was 'by far the best portrayl [sic] of Negro life and hope and problems ever to reach any screen. So compelling and vivid is the dual theme of the picture that one wanders away into the unbelievable charm it possesses in a dreamy and utterly captivating manner.'40 He affirmed that he had paid his own way to see it; and that 'I was so overwhelmed by the superb story so surprised at the Old South going for it so strongly that I just would like to insist that you see it'. 'Good people', he urged, 'if you miss 'Imita tions [sic] of Life' I think you should be pitied... ' After listing the white cast, he concluded, 'It is elaborate'. Roberts' unabashed enthusiasm was reiter ated in the Daily World over the next several weeks. Three days after his piece appeared - with only three days left in the Fox run - the December 10 issue of the Daily World featured two newswire stories on the film in its 'Theatre* Movies *Radio' page, both of which celebrated the appearance of more prominent roles for African-Americans in Hollywood films, citing Bill Robinson and Hattie McDaniel in Fox's forthcom ing The Little Colonel, and offering high praise for Beavers and Washington in Imitation of Life41 Like wise at the top of the same page, the Daily World carried a wire story by Ray Buford, '"Imitations" [sic] is a Break for Race', covering the film's premiere at Hollywood's Pantages Theater. Buford stressed the maternal melodrama elements in the film, calling it a 'glorious tribute to motherhood' in its stories of 'moth ers and their willingness to sacrifice for the daugh ters' happiness', and as 'a combined study in sociology and psychology' due to its parallel stories of different races. Having characterized it as a film 'to test the sympathies of humans of the other fellow's troubles', Buford further noted that 'while the touchy subject of interracial love is not touched, it will cause many people to think. It plainly shows problems of two groups and the similarity of them. I ask all of you to see it for two reasons: it will give you an insight into problems and will show you two great coloured ac tresses.'42Buford was in complete accord with At lanta's own Ric Roberts, and both agreed with the trade reviewers. As Imitation of Life's black premiere ap proached in January 1935, this trickle of notices became a flood of publicity and advertising. Virtually every day, the Daily World featured another ad, an other short news item, and/or another publicity still from the film in a wave of attention befitting the film's status as one of the first Hollywood movies to show African Americans dramatically, sympathetically and at length on screen, One article in the 13 January 1935 issue of the Daily World praised the black cast performances and printed the same paragraph used in the Constitution's 'review' - on Fannie Hurst's popularity with women and John Stahl's swell han dling of a previous Hurst novel, Back Street. But the Da/7y World piece then identified the crucial dramatic thread of the film which the Constitution had skirted and which the PCA had been alarmed about in its early comments on the film project: An unusual picture, which is a frank discussion of the miscegenation question, Imitation of Life gives Negroes a new type of role in motion pictures .... Delilah Johnson is played by Miss Beavers, while Peola, her daughter, too white to be coloured and too dark to be white, is vividly brought to the screen by Miss Washington.

And Miss Washington's 'vivid' performance was here touted, as it was in many black newspapers of the era, as a phenomenal appeal of the film. As Anna Everett has noted, Peola / Fredi Washington's 'private yearning was the public demand for an ac knowledgment of black humanity'. As Donald Bogle has put it, Peola embodied the 'New Negro demand ing a New Deal'.44 Ads and articles in the Daily World emphasized in diverse ways the black content of Imitation of Ufe. In advance of the Royal run, image-less ads listed Louise Beavers and Fredi Washington, with copy calling Imitation of Ufe 'the most talked about film of the year' and 'a cross section of the Negro's strug gles'.45 Two days before the Royal run began, the paper ran a single-column ad with a publicity still of Peola begging Delilah to let her run away. The ac companying copy proclaimed 'the Greatest Roles Ever Given Negro Stars!' and 'It will tug at your heart strings, make you laugh, then cry!'46 The day before the Royal Theater run began, a large box ad noted, 'At last it's here; the picture so frank that it shocked the country' (Fig. 11), once again a direct reference to Peola's plight and the hint of miscegenation in the story.47 Once Imitation of Ufe began its run at the Royal, for two weeks one could not read the Atlanta Daily World without being aware that the film was playing in the black side of town and that it had unprecedented significance for black Atlantans who were moviegoers and newspaper readers. In this coverage, the white stars and characters of the film were window dressing for the true drama of the black characters. On 20 January, the day of the film's opening at the Royal, the paper featured a large, three-column wide photo of Louise Beavers trying to comfort the recumbent Fredi Washington and listed the four scheduled performances for the day. The accompanying review, Two Colored Actors Superb in Royal Film', was written by a staffer, and reiterated that the version shown at the Royal was 'uncut'. Moreover, with a logic that recognized the centrality of the black plot to the film and the true reason for its existence, this piece baldly dismissed the white plot as bland and the white stars as the necessary com promise to get the film made. It wondered hopefully: Are the doors of Hollywood about to swing wide and admit the artist on the basis of ability? Will colour be forgotten in casting for plays in the center of this great industry? In short, will we ever come into the spot where we will be able to live up to the expectations of our ad mirers yet who heretofore have not given us a chance to prove without doubt those same qualities? ... In this picture, the Negro player comes into his own and Louise Beavers and Fredi Wash ington truly set a fast pace for even the best Hollywood has to offer in acting, to follow... . When one sees the picture, one forgets Claudette Colbert and Warren William, who were appropriately cast by the producers for box-office purposes, and concentrates on the superb acting of Miss Beavers and Miss Wash ington.48 Atlanta's black movie fans were further en couraged to overlook Claudette Colbert and Warren William by the text appearing in the large ad placed in the paper on the same page, below the review. Like all the major studios, Universal had prepared few, if any, ads for black theaters featuring the black cast. This reflected Hollywood's general neglect of the black press and black movie customers.49 In the case of Imitation of Ufe, for example, the Universal</page><page sequence="14">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 165 Weekly of 13 October 1934 devoted one page each to the white leads in the film and gathered all the white supporting actors (Ned Sparks, Alan Hale, etc.) onto one page; the black cast members got virtually no column space at all, and appeared only in the bottom corners of a photo-montage of the cast.50 But Bailey Theaters worked around this obsta cle by revamping ads in Universal's press book for the film. They made the ads 'local' with new 'head lines' each day over the same image of Claudette Colbert alone, looking solemn as she faces left in profile: 'Hundreds of Atlantans Were Thrilled Yester day; It Must Be Good'; 'Powerful! ... A One-Word Description Agree Those who Have Seen'. On the first day of the Ashby Theater run, the ad provided a 'high concept' tagline for the film's black plot: 'She Disowned Her Mother And Denied Her Own Race! Too Light to be Colored Too Dark to be White!' (Fig. 12). In any case, this practice of revamping studio advertising for Hollywood films was common for Bailey Theaters at this time. For example, the run at its Theater 81 of Fox's Gift of Gab, Shirley Temple's breakthrough film, was advertised in the Daily World with ad mats highlighting Ethel Waters, the Beal Street Boys and 'thirty other stars', listing the white leads ("Frankenstein' Karloff, Ruth Etting', etc.) be low the title.51 One of the most interesting of these ads fea tured the same prominent image of Colbert, but now with Warren William and Rochelle Hudson (Jessie) appearing in close profile with clasped hands to gether in the background (Fig. 13). While the images evoke a romantic triangle, the copy here puts Bea vers and Washington's names prominently above the title, and William and Colbert's below. Additional copy reads 'too Light to be Colored ...too Dark to be White!' The black cast and plotlines 'frame' the image of the white stars. In fact, in the unlikely case that a black moviegoer did not know what Fredi Washing ton looked like, she might suspect after glancing at this ad that the romantic triangle also involved her (Peola) passing - miscegenation, occurring in the film's present tense, rather than implied in Peola's father's past - a far greater cause for alarm than that which concerned Joseph Breen.52 Creating such sensational inferences might well have been the Bailey Theaters management's precise intent. Publicity stills provided another way to over come the absence of ad mats featuring the black cast, and Bailey's Theaters and the Daily World made heavy use of them. One could find scenes of Beavers Sha -Diiqmrmd And ?mim? Hm Too htght t? be . ? Too $tefk to b? 1 Whitc?? L06ISS BEAVER Fig. 12. Too Light to be Colored, Too Dark to be White.'

The photo appeared under a headline again paraphrasing Delilah's dialogue response, 'I am your mother' (Fig. 14). Perhaps the most distinctive use of such stills involves the scene in which Delilah unmasks Peola from her 'white job' as a cashier in a coffee shop: it appeared over a caption which identifies this as 'one of the most dramatic scenes from the picture', while the headline above the photo paraphrases Delilah's dialogue line: 'Won't you come back?'53 Significantly, in this shot Bea looks on, virtually cropped out of the right edge of the picture. Like the rearranged copy in the ad mat for the film, this editing of the image reversed the usual spatial deployment of black and white performers in Hollywood films, one that placed African American actors at the margins of the shot or the scene (Fig. 15). In the actual film, Colbert is never seen in a master shot - or a three shot, for that matter -with Delilah and Peola (Figs. 16-17, for example). Yet, here in the publicity still, it is Colbert at the edge of the frame, looking on with interest, thereby mirror ing the audience's perspective, as Beavers confronts Washington. This image ran over the ad mat of Claudette Colbert reading 'Powerful!... ', juxtaposing the two images to ensure that casual readers recog nized what was most compelling in the film. Sometimes, for variety's sake presumably, Bailey Theaters and the Daily World used stills featur ing the white leads. On these occasions, the editors' headlines and captions re-directed readers' atten tion to the black cast and story. For example, on 22 January, a still of William and Colbert dancing was headlined, 'Supply Love Interest', as if they were Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a Warner Bros, musical, rather than the top-credited roles in Stahl's film. The caption concluded by noting that Washington and Beavers 'are seen in two of the greatest roles ever given colored players'.54 On the 24th, a shot of Col bert with Rochelle Hudson was headlined 'Mother and Daughter' while the caption noted that Beavers and Washington 'have equally important roles', a rare concession to the prominence of the white perform ers. On the 26th, when an ad mat showed Colbert and Williams smiling intimately at each other, the names of Beavers, Washington and Dorothy Black (who played Peola as a child) were, again, more prominent and displayed above their faces, with Wil</page><page sequence="16">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 167 liam and Colbert's below (Fig. 18). 5 A publicity shot of Claudette Colbert reading a copy of Hurst's novel had a caption noting that she played 'opposite' Bea vers and Washington; beneath this photo was an other article announcing that the film 'gives Race Players Big Break', an opportunity comparable with Clarence Brooks' appearance as the 'intelligent' Dr. Marchand in John Ford's Arrowsmith (1931) and Etta Moten's performances in the 1933 musicals Gold Diggers of 1933 and Flying Down to Rio. The 'Big Break', in each instance, was precisely in giving 'the Negro a role other than a servant', a phrase which sums up much of the film's appeal at the time.56 On 28 January, under the headline 'Mother Has Prob lem' there appeared a still of Colbert and William looking thoughtful and serious as they sit in the funeral car, with a caption explaining that 'Claudette Colbert... finds an unusual problem on her hands ... when she discovers that her daughter has fallen in love with her own fianc?'. But here too, after giving the white plot and stars their due, the caption reiter ated that Louise Beavers and Fredi Washington 'por tray the greatest roles ever given colored players in the super picture'.57 In short, the black Bailey Atlanta theaters, with the Daily World's cooperation, re worked the advertising and publicity materials Uni versal had devised to address directly their audience's interest in the film.58 Star discourses in print As this pattern indicates, throughout its coverage of Imitation of Life and even before its run at the Royal, the Atlanta Daily World not surprisingly focused on the casting of black actors, and their powerful per formances as the key component to the film's ap peal. As the country's only black daily, the paper's focus on the film was especially emphatic but highly varied.59 Brief news items and profiles of Beavers and Washington appeared on different days to give read ers capsule biographies and correlate their on screen roles with their real life experiences and attitudes. On 16 January, a preview article entitled 'Gripping Drama to Open Long Run at the Royal' profiled Fredi Washington's performance, her mar riage to the Duke Ellington band's trombonist Lawrence Brown, and her previous appearance in the Ellington short 'Black and Tan'.60 The next day, three days before the start of the run at the Royal, the paper ran a wire story on how Washington came to be cast as 'a colored girl who would photograph white', a piece which touted her and Louise Beavers' roles as the best in films since Clarence Brooks' often-referenced breakthrough part in Arrowsmith. Four days into the film's run at the Royal, a third short item appeared on Washington, informing the paper's readers that Washington broke her promise to her husband, 'a minister's son', that she would give up the stage.61 Alongside these news items, the Da/7y World varied its publicity by running short American Negro Press items on Fredi Washington's stage ca reer (including her alleged actual passing in a white hotel in Wilmington, Delaware during a run of Black Boy, in which she had played - opposite Paul Robeson - a mulatto passing as white), as well as speculation on her next movie role.62 S?B^^^^^I^^I??Eff' Fig. 16.

Washington " .Dorothy BU SU( Lengthier articles in the Da/7y World presented intriguing commentary on Imitation of Ufe, on Holly wood's stereotyped roles for black performers and how each performer related to her character in the film. For example, a profile of Beavers, which ap peared the day before the film began its run at the Royal, stressed the usual publicity conflation of actor and role. Beavers, it reported, had worked as a maid to movie stars before she became an actress. With a sense of understatement, Beavers is quoted as saying that at that point she had no ambition to go into movies: 'In all that I have ever seen', she said recently, 'they never used colored people for any thing except savages - and I had no ambition to appear before the public in a G-string and an African smile. The costume seemed a little bit too sketchy for general use.'63 Beavers' comments here about Afri can roles constituted a bemused criticism on her part about Hollywood stereotyping, with a humorous aside about the exploitation of black bodies as a form of spectacle. And where, as Anna Everett has shown, the Pittsburgh Courier gave Beavers negative public ity for allegedly neglecting her black fans, the Da/7y World made no use of such stories.64 A subsequent piece, published more than a week later, introduced still another stereotype for Beavers. It reported that when retakes were required on the set and fresh pancakes were needed, Beavers made better (thicker) quality pancakes than Univer sal^ property man.65 (Such publicity flatly contra dicted the claim, reported by Donald Bogle, that Beavers 'detested kitchen work and abhorred pan cakes'.) Many more such brief profiles of Beavers appeared as the film played out its run in the black Atlanta theaters.66 They gave contradictory signals on how she related to her role - Delilah may have been a departure from what another piece described as her 'rollicking comedy parts' but the role was typecasting (since Beavers had worked as a maid before and made great pancakes). All this was far less exotic than the other brand of type-casting in voked with her career, that of the 'African savage'. By contrast, the keynote of Fredi Washington's publicity in connection with Imitation of Ufe was how much she differed from the unhappy Peola, even if so much of the film's power derived from Washing ton's empathetic performance. While Imitation of Ufe ran at the Ashby, and after the news item about her passing while appearing on stage with Paul Robe son, an interview with Washington, titled 'Fredi Wash ington Really Against "Passing"', revealed that she had refused to attempt to pass as white in Hollywood, in spite of urgings from producers and managers there, who had recognized her resemblance to then Warner Bros, star Ruth Chatterton. In this Da/7y World account, presumably taken from a wire service arti cle, Washington is presented as a sultry, passionate artist with flashing eyes who smokes Russian ciga rettes: Why should I pass for anything ... but an artist? When I act, I live the role I am assigned to do. If that part calls for me to be a West Indian half caste, a Spanish or Creole maiden, a French woman, a lady of great social distinction or a prostitute, how can I or anyone essay such roles with the bugbear of his national heritage constantly dangled before his eyes? I don't want to 'pass' because I can't stand insincerities and shams. I am just as much 'Negro' as any of the others without presuming to average my ability.67 Washington's comments here could be seen to reinforce one interpretation of the film, perhaps her</page><page sequence="18">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 169 own: that Peola's struggles to pass resulted in noth ing but insincerity, dishonesty, and bitterness. At the same time, Washington's itemization of possible roles she might play also reinforces the reader's sense of her confidence as a performer, her versatil ity, thereby emphasizing her thespian abilities as much as the film does - all in contrast to the straight jacket roles that Louise Beavers mentions. More explicitly than Beavers, however, Washington de cries Hollywood producers for constantly weighing her black race against her casting potential. She was even more outspoken on this point in wire stories published in other black newspapers.68 In short, the two contrasting generations of actors represented by Beavers and Washington in Imitation of Life also played out across their profiles in the Daily World. If in the Pittsburgh Courier Fredi Washington was singled out for her moving performance and for the demands of equality that Peola articulated, in Atlanta Beavers received comparable attention. The paper's regular column 'Seeing the Shows' reviewed all the films then showing at Bailey theaters, but singled out Imitation of Life as the finest film ever made and lauded Beavers for her versatility: 'In moods of gaiety or of tragic drama she is equally effective, and at all times her true loveable self. Beavers was matched, in this writer's view, only by Washington. 'How Peola's growing hatred for her race because of her light color turns into love forms one of the most dramatic discussions of the race question yet seen on the screen.'69 Whichever star or storyline was highlighted in the paper, all this coverage reflected the film's over whelming appeal to that city's black moviegoers, enabling the Atlanta Daily World to reinforce its read ers' interest and make a major advertiser happy. As part of the paper's coverage, Daily World writers recounted the film's powerful effect on audiences in the Bailey Theaters. Staff writer Jimmy Perry hailed the film as 'unquestionably the most unique picture ever filmed and to me one of the best pictures I have had the pleasure of seeing. This picture', he contin ued, 'is truly a soul-gripping picture'. Perry reported that he had counted 21 viewers in tears and that the manager had counted even more.70 As we have seen, this response was hardly restricted to Atlanta's black movie fans; Andre Sennwald in the New York Times and Bernice Patton of the Pittsburgh Courier had noted comparable responses at New York and trade previews, though for Sennwald this was a mark of the film's unworthiness as a melodrama.71 Three ?Brh'wSP^??'

Atlanta Daily World (27 January 1935). days later, the Daily World's Lucius Jones began his society column by promoting the film's shift the fol lowing day to the Ashby Theater. Jones noted that 'REALISM studs every moment ofthat most poignant of dramas .... The story thrills with its double plot, its genuine qualities, and the occasional humor pro vided, largely, by the naive Louise Beavers as Delilah Johnson. '72 If the white northern reviewers felt the film tried to do too much, Jones found the film to be a cornucopia of entertainment delights. His comments on Louise Beavers' comedy moments indicate that her character's role was not always read as simply tragic and that her childlike responses at certain points amused black viewers as well as whites. From such intense responses to the film came repeat business. "IMITATION OF LIFE' is continuing to pack in daily throngs at Bailey's ASHBY', columnist Lucius Jones wrote on 29 January.73 Jones contin ued: 'It is interesting to note the many duplications [i.e. repeat customers]. We have seen the fine play several times now and, on every occasion, we've always been able to spot some faces at the perfor mance that we had already seen at an earlier show ing of the film.' This news of repeat business was</page><page sequence="19">170 Matthew H. Bernstein and Dana F. White I reiterated on the front page of the January 31 copy of the Da/7y World, which boasted that the film had broken 'all records for a local colored run', that it had played to capacity for all five days of its run at the Royal and then at the New Ashby, and that Bailey's was holding the film over 'to accommodate the hun dreds of people who have been turned away for lack of space or even standing room .... Many Atlanta residents, it has been found, have seen the absorb ing drama as many as six and seven times'.74 Shortly before the end of the Ashby run, Bailey Theaters again ran the Claudette Colbert ad mat with a tag line that read Three more days and the picture of a lifetime will be gone forever' (Fig. 19). In fact, as we have noted, the film would return to Bailey Thea ters several times over the course of 1935. Its five-day run at Bailey's 81 Theater in May 1935 apparently also drew standing room only crowds.75 The stars, as much as the story, were the key component of its popularity. 'Searching criticism' of Imitation of Life: Sterling Brown and black Atlanta's critics Imitation of Life's astounding repeat business likely inspired the Da/7y World's columnists to write ex tended analyses of the film. For Harlem Renaissance author and critic Sterling A. Brown, one showing of Imitation of Life would likely have sufficed. His 1935 essay 'Imitation of Life: Once a Pancake' established a framework for his contemporaries, as well as a definitive assessment for future critics, of Stahl's popular production. In the process, he fixed the label 'controversial' to the film. His comments, published months after the film's screenings in Atlanta, provide another template for considering those analyses in the Atlanta Da/7y World by critics who like Brown engaged with the film in a more sustained way than straightforward expressions of enthusiasm. The thrust of Brown's critique was that the black leads were merely refurbished southern literary stereotypes: Delilah's passive suffering and resigna tion stems from that source, while her refusal to take an active role in the pancake company and her unwillingness to establish a home for herself and her daughter is nothing less than 'the old slave refusing freedom'. For Brown, Peola in turn is nothing more than 'the tragic octoroon' who is not allowed to understand the dimensions of her unhappiness: | There is a chance for real bitterness when Miss Bea stops her as she is finally leaving her mother. But the tirade does not come, al though Peola must have seen through the condescension and the gentle exploitation. It would be refreshing to have heard what a girl like Peola would really have said; I believe Miss Washington could have risen to heights in its delivery. There is a scene where Miss Bea goes upstairs while Delilah goes down. It is symbolic of many things. One is, that in Imita tion of Life where Claudette Colbert has a role to bring out all that there is in her, both Miss Beavers and Miss Washington, have, so to speak, to go downstairs; Miss Beavers to a much greater childishness, and Miss Wash ington to a much greater bewilderment than they would recognize in real life. But so Holly wood would have it; and so Hollywood gets something less artistic and less true.76 In his concluding paragraph, Brown contrasts the film's synthesis of literary stereotypes of black characters with its unintended 'moments of truth to American life': that Bea would take the credit and the lion's share of the profits for the company when her 'contributions were mild flirtations for business sup port, and energy, and "brains'"; that Bea and Delilah would not ride side by side in their car and that even a daughter would have to sit with the chauffeur at her own mother's funeral (Fig. 20) and that in affluence Jessie faces a life of luxury and superficial cares while Peola faces 'a precarious future, remorse-ridden and threatening. All of this is true to the ways of America', Brown concludes. 'But it hardly seems anything to cheer about'. Brown's comments would provoke a virulent defense of the film from Fannie Hurst, to which Brown would reply with even more pointed criticisms of the film.77 The terms of Brown's initial review, as well as Hurst's and Brown's heated debate, demonstrate tha? Imitation of Life presented a singular and, it would turn out, an ongoing challenge for film critics and movie lovers around the country, then and now - if only because of its unprecedented dramatic treat ment of black characters situated within an almost always unacknowledged racist environment. In contrast to Brown, two lengthy articles on Imitation of Life in the Daily World engaged directly with the film's treatment of 'race' from a reasoned, critical, regional, and authentically Atlantan perspec tive. The most trenchant analysis of the film came in</page><page sequence="20">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 171 A. Randall, Jr.'s 'A Criticism of Imitation of Life', the first Atlanta-based, sustained evaluation of the film in the paper, which was published during the film's run at the Fox.78 This Morehouse College librarian and poet, and Atlanta University faculty member, essen tially endorsed the film. It was, Randall wrote, 'the first effort of white film producers to delineate real Negro character upon the screen and to allow Negro actors to show their talents in a real, true-to-life plot, and as such, it is deserving of searching criticism as well as hearty applause'. He dismissed previous films that made the same claim: Hallelujah! was just 'a serio comic musical extravaganza' and The Emperor Jones was 'an O'Neillian fantasy which might have had as its characters any race of people under the sun'. Those two films related as much to real Negro life as Alice in Wonderland did as 'a true tale of white life'. By comparison Randall found much to praise in Imitation of Life: 'it attempts a truthful characterization and goes far toward making a success of its effort to bring true Negro characters to the screen'. Still, Randall offered 'searching criticisms' of Imitation of Life that testify to a singular engagement with the film's subject matter, thereby providing a sophisticated examination of its racial politics, one that serves as counterpoint to Sterling Brown's over all rejection of the film. Randall noted several disap pointing details in the film that detracted from its realism. The thrust of his critique was that while Imitation of Ufe nearly succeeded in its effort to present 'a truthful characterization' and to 'bring real true Negro characters to the screen', the film was also flawed in 'the little things which are not quite true [that] serve to spoil a rather effective presentation'. He speculated that while John Stahl 'deserves credit for this masterly effort', the director 'allows stereo typed notions to warp his notions about the race and its trials'. Here, Randall was on the same page with Brown. Yet Randall specified elements decidedly dif ferent from Sterling Brown's when he criticized the film; for example, he singled out the scene of black servants in Bea's home singing a hymn as Delilah lies near death as too stereotyped. More significantly, Randall found realism in Delilah's 'old timey attitude' and character where Brown had found tired stereo type, for Randall acknowledged that the 'loving, loyal, foolish servitor of white people has not yet passed from the ranks of the race. One can find Aunt Delilahs every day in the race, who have their dues paid up in all of the lodges and whose only ambition is to have a grand funeral.' He also singled out as a summary moment in the film Delilah's statement to Bea that 'we-ums don't get dumb till we get old', a line of dialogue that reveals a self-consciousness on Deli lah's part, which the rest of the film appears to deny, as the essence of the film. In characterizing Delilah in these ways, Randall affirmed the truthfulness of the film's depiction of her. At the same time, Randall found Peola's char acterization the greatest inaccuracy of the entire film. Her motivations for passing, he argued, appeared to be self-hatred and these were unconvincing. Unlike Sterling Brown, Randall could forgive the white crea tors of the film for this misstep, since, he noted, black author Jessie Faucet had made a similar mistake (presumably Randall here referenced her 1928 novel Plum Bun). Randall suggested instead that a better explanation for Peola's motives came from James Weldon Johnson's observations (presumably in The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man, the most no table treatment up to that point of the phenomenon of passing): Black Americans who could pass did so not because they 'hate to be Negroes, but rather that they wish to escape the economic and social bur dens that being a Negro usually entails'. Given her presumed affluence, he argued, 'It is incredible that any colored girl who is possessed of as much money as Peola had, and who enjoyed as many social advantages as she did, should attempt to run away from her home and sacrifice her inheritance to pass for white; yet it is subtly flattering to white people that she should do so'. Randall's acuity lay in seeing the film's illogical depiction of Peola's desire to pass as . Jr .^1_. Fig. 20. At the funeral, Peola takes her place up front with the driver.</page><page sequence="21">172 Matthew H. Bernstein and Dana F. White superseding consideration of all her other options as itself the product of a racist ideology, an illogical accommodation to the white-proscribed colour line. And perhaps, as we will see, he could make this observation because of his familiarity with mixed race families in Black Atlanta. Towards his conclusion, Randall praised the performances of Fredi Washington and especially Louise Beavers 'as the sweet old time mammy who is rapidly disappearing from the American scene'. By contrast, he felt Jessie's relative coolness to Delilah was implausible, given that Delilah had 'raised' her 'almost from infancy'. 'Mammy' and white child should have had a more affectionate relationship in the film. But overall, Randall urged his readers to see the film: The producers of Imitation of Life deserve the congratulations of every Negro who would like to see the race get a break in legitimate roles on the screen', he concluded, 'and when the picture swings around to a colored show we must be sure to see it'. If Randall's assessment of the film is less biting and more sociologically-informed than Sterling Brown's, it also strikes a different tone from the only other sustained analysis of Imitation of Life that origi nated with the Da/7y World. Gamewell Valentine's Theme and Variations' offered its own distinctive ruminations on issues in African-American life in spired by the film as it neared the end of its run in black Atlanta.79 Valentine, a professional musician who would join the staff of the Da/7y World within the year, praised the 'realistic and dramatic' funeral scene, comment ing that The Negro is unjustly accused of being the only race indulging in pompous funerals. Whites do the same ... Negroes not having an army or navy [like the majority population] through their fraternal or ders, make believe they are their army and navy with their military regalia and strut in proud fashion.' In deed, only a few blocks east of the Da/7y World offices, stood the imposing Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium, headquarters of the Atlanta Chapter of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, and a bit farther along Auburn Avenue, the Prince Hall Masons Building. In a word, the pageantry portrayed in Imita tion of Life would not have been out of place along Sweet Auburn. Like Randall, Valentine devoted the most col umn inches to the subject of mulattoes and passing. Stating his feeling that mulattoes belonged with whites, if they so chose, Valentine described how his recollection of George S. Schuyler's Black No More, 'a supreme satire of color-complex', 'neutralized all of my sentimental emotions that might have been aroused over Delilah's problem in keeping her daughter in a race that was black'. This 1931 novel, by a New Negro Movement leader and Messenger columnist who counted H.L. Mencken among his admirers, envisioned a medical procedure that made black Americans appear 'white' and thereby seems to 'solve' the race question. Instead, it creates a general paranoia in America about who is really 'black'. Those transformed appear 'whiter' than white Americans who, in response, make their skins darker to keep racial distinctions intact, and thus reinvigor ate and replicate the 'race problem'. Beyond the appeal of Schuyler's satiric treatment of a pressing issue, his protagonist - who is the first to undergo the experimental process to whiten his skin - is an At lanta native, who is rudely rejected in the novel's opening chapter by a white Atlanta belle whom he encounters in Manhattan (1 never dance with nig gers', she tells him). His desire for this woman moti vates his willingness to subject himself to the process. The Atlanta references in Black No More likely ensured its value as a cultural reference point for Valentine and his readers. With Schuyler's sce nario in mind, Valentine notes that his sympathies remained with Peola rather than Delilah. Valentine also used the film as an occasion to discuss the dynamics of racial prejudice. 'Black is not despised on account of color', he wrote, 'but because of [the] American white'; in fact, he argues, Fannie Hurst (whom he mistakenly thought was French) could not have set the story in France, for there 'Peola could live with equal latitude as her friends whether white or black'.80 A lack of racial affinity within the black community, Valentine sug gests, has 'made it impossible for colored Americans to stick together'. Again invoking personal experi ence, he observed: There are plenty of Peolas in Atlanta, and they can't help from wanting to go with their race [i.e. whites]. It is ridiculous to force a man or woman whose father is white and mother black to live with colored people. [I] [m]ean when there is more white blood than black (Figuratively). ' Valentine then offers examples of light-skinned blacks who, like Peola, have passed: a white man who identified with blacks like a 'white southern Liberal' but who had 'little or no contact with colored folk'; and the presi dent of a Negro college, who looked like a Mexican and who could have passed for white in Austin, Texas, but who preferred to stand in the back of a</page><page sequence="22">Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta 173 street car and talk with the conductor rather than sit down, since that would 'show his identity'. Where earlier Randall had focused on the regrettable as pects of Delilah's 'old timey' Mammy personality, Valentine disagreed with her old fashioned approach to the problem of passing and focused instead on validating Peola's aspirations - not in terms of their challenge to white supremacy, but as a particular approach to a specific challenge in life. Where Sterling Brown's critique evaluated the film in terms of white racist literary traditions and stereotypes, the Atlanta writers chose to assess the film more in terms of their personally observed social realities and experiences. In addition, for Valentine, as for the film's other major Da/7y World critic, realistic contemporary black fiction offered a more pertinent point of reference than moth-eaten plantation nov els.81 Both he and Randall offered Da/7y World read ers an array of 'searching criticism', more engaged ways to think about the film months in advance of Brown's own searching analysis in Opportunity. Atlanta's unique situation Why did black critical response to Imitation of Life in Atlanta, with its emphasis on everyday realities, differ from the national norm with its focus on literary stereotypes? To begin with, there were the realities of its region. 'At the beginning of the twentieth cen tury', historian David Goldfield has pointed out, 'the South was America's most interracial region. Al though no statistics would corroborate that impres sion, all you had to do was look around at the wide variety of hues, derived mainly from black-white sex ual relations ... a legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and all the inequality that had existed in the South for nearly three centuries.' This observable reality, Gold field suggests, was 'hardly ever discussed publicly but whispered about in private'.82 Silence on the subject of 'race mixing', as it was often called, almost certainly held true for the South's majority population, but certainly not for its minority members, especially those in Atlanta. In contrast with the multi-ethnic and religiously plural North and Midwest, the American South was decidedly biracial. Overwhelmingly, its inhabitants were either black or white and, with some exceptions, members of Protestant denominations - most of those 'low church'. Other cultural traits and religious traditions in the urban South were, then, rather mar ginal. It was race that established the dividing line or 'color line'. For example, when he first entered Atlanta University in 1887, James Weldon Johnson would recall in his 1933 autobiography Along This Way, 'Students talked "race"'. In Atlanta, this later Harlem Renaissance author and lyricist would experience 'my initiation into the arcana of "race"'.83 These 'ar cana' - or 'profound secrets' and 'mysteries' in dic tionary terms - would include 'race mixing', which had already occurred to such a degree that, as historian Joel Williamson has indicated, many ob servers projected the emergence of a 'new people' -neither black nor white, but, instead, 'brown'.84 The dramatization of miscegenation which the PCA guarded against was, in this sense, old news in the South. In 1932, just three years before Imitation of Life's black Atlanta debut, Harvard University Press published Caroline Bond Day's A Study of Some Negro-White Families in the United States. In his 'Foreword' to this volume, the Peabody Museum's Earnest A. Hooton described its author as 'an ap proximate mulatto, having about half Negro and half White blood'. Day's work, initiated during her senior year at Radcliffe College (Class of 1919), involved the collecting of 'genealogical, sociological, photo graphic, and anthropomorphic records' of 346 fami lies of mixed race. Her sample was heavily weighted toward Georgia, which accounted for 144 families (that is, over 45 per cent of the total), 42 of them resident in Atlanta. The next two highest state sam ples were from Alabama and Texas, each approach ing the 13 per cent mark. Her highest-ranking non-southern state was New York, with 12 families (almost 4 per cent of her sample). Her 91 tables ranged from 'Age', to 'Biocranial Diameter', to 'Ce phalic Index', to 'Hair Texture', to 'Lips, Membranous Thickness', to 'Darwin's Point': in sum, the 'anthro pom?trie' data so popular among some social sci entists and many eugenicists of the Progressive Era. What was most original and valuable in Day's work, historically speaking, were her genealogical charts, generously illustrated with photographs of 'Individual Families'. Representing Atlanta were such luminaries as Du Bois, NAACP General Secretary Walter H. White, Morehouse College and Atlanta University President John Hope, and the 'Calhoun Graves' family, the maternal ancestors of Lena Home. Caroline Bond Day knew many of these fami lies through her own Atlanta University ties: she had graduated from A.U. (Class of 1912) before entering Radcliffe, and would later become an A.U. faculty member. The 'arcana of race' drove her investiga</page><page sequence="23">174 Matthew H. Bernstein and Dana F. White tions, by today's lights, to an extreme; still, she might well have gone farther. A limiting factor in her re search, Day noted briefly, 'has been the fear of exposure of those members of the family who are 'passing for white' or who have 'gone on the other side', as it is frequently expressed. In thirty-five out of the 346 families studied there are one or more mem bers who are 'passing' either entirely, or only tempo rarily for purposes of obtaining lucrative employment. There are at least fifty more families with whom I am acquainted in which there are mem bers 'passing' ...85 'Passing' could be discussed (and even documented) within the race, in other words, but not across the color line. Since race mixing shaped its most compelling plot line, Imitation of Life possessed an inevitable appeal for Black Atlantans. This interest, when com bined with the unprecedented promotion and public ity campaign orchestrated by the Bailey Theaters and the Atlanta Daily World, turned the showing of Imita tion of Life into a major cultural event. Here, a movie goer's experience of viewing Imitation of Life at the Royal or the Ashby became special. Here, moviego ing became reconfigured through ads and articles into a distinctively Black Atlanta happening - some thing to be enjoyed over and over, and then again. Current scholarship on the film accurately ar ticulates the difficulties a contemporary black female viewer might have in identifying with the characters of Delilah and Peoia; we note that it was black men who published all the Atlanta Daily World commen taries on the film, but we should also note that their comments allude to such obstacles to audience sympathy.86 Still, in the specific context of 1934-1935, male and female black Atlantans flocked to see the film and pondered its meanings. In fact, throughout the decade ahead, Imitation of Life would be replayed repeatedly at Atlanta race theaters, es pecially the Royal and the Ashby. Upon its re-release in late 1945, however, it would be banned in Atlanta (and in 1950, in Memphis). The film's basically com passionate treatment of two single moms struggling to survive across the color line had carried it through the Depression Decade. Its muted challenge to the legitimacy of a segregated order made it suspect in a postwar South at the starting point of what would develop into the Civil Rights Movement. In the strug gles ahead, Atlanta would play an ever more vital role in that movement, 'race' even more its issue. The post-1945 reception of Imitation of Life belongs then to another era, and awaits still another study. Acknowledgements: We thank Randy Gue and Gordon D.

In the novel, Jessie wins over Bea's younger love interest and announces their intent to marry as the novel ends, whereas in the film, Bea gives Stephen up when she learns Jessie has fallen in love with him. The New York Herald Tribune provided a concise overview of less significant, but still major plot changes screenwriter William Hurlbut made in adapt ing Hurst's novel. Beyond the usual compression of time and reduced number of characters, in the film, the novel's waffles became pancakes, their business shifted from a restaurant chain to a boxed pancake mix, Bea's love interest shifted from a restaurant manager to a marine biologist and the conflict with Jessie was inflated for the film from the book.

Beyond pancakes, Atlanta audience appreciation for the film would likely been enhanced, momentarily, by Elmer's advice to Bea when he tastes the pancakes: 'Box it'. He refers to the example of Coca-Cola and the two words of advice that made a fortune: 'Bottle it'. 33.

These generalizations arise from a study of film listings in Atlanta theaters from fall 1934 to fall 1935. 38. 'Great Drama to Open At Royal', ADW (13 January 1935): 7. Likewise, the 7 May 1935, p. 2, article, 'Picture Playing at 81 is Original Uncut Version', ADW, reaffirmed that the Bailey theater management was 'forced to send to Hollywood to secure an 'uncut' version' of the film when it originally played at the Royal in January. It is unlikely Bailey would have made this claim idly, since some black Atlantans (like Ric Roberts) had seen the film at the Fox as well as at the Bailey Theaters, and would have noticed if the prints were the same. Another bit of incomplete evidence that there may have indeed been a cut version shown comes from the city censorship re cords. While Atlanta's film censor at the time, Mrs. Zella Richardson, made no comment in her Decem ber 1934 report about cutting the film, her November 1934 report mentions that she and her review board contemplated banning an unnamed film 'as a matter of offense against southern tradition and good taste' ; but here again, suggestive as these phrases are, they do not indicate Imitation of Life was the specific film at issue. Mrs. Richardson only comments that there was not 'sufficient grounds' to ban the film and says nothing about cutting offensive scenes. If she did cut out certain scenes involving Delilah and Peola, this would have provided more reason for the Fox's publicity and ad material to down play the black plot. And while Mrs. Richardson's response to the film is uncertain, we do know that Dolph Frantz, managing editor of the Shreveport Journal, wrote E.V. Richards, of the theater circuit, on the occasion of Imitation of Life's release to express (in what Frantz characterized as 'a friendly manner') 'the feeling of resentment that is provoked in this part of the country by "Social equality" phases of these and some other pictures'. Even if she didn't cut or ban Imitation of Life, Mrs. Richardson utterly agreed with Frantz's sentiments. It could well have been that the Fox Theater management, or Fox's distribution office in Atlanta, might have made the cuts, Reports of the Atlanta Censor, November and December, 1934, in authors'possession. Frantz references this commu niqu? in his letter to Richards, 25 August 1937, Imitation of Ufe PCA File, CLAc. 39. Everett, 193. 40.

The VHS release of Imitation of Life includes a short trailer which focuses on the film's black stars. No copyright appears on the trailer. It consists of still photos of Louise Beavers and Fredi Washington in scenes from the film, with titles which quote critical comments from black and white newspapers on their performances. There is a non-synchronous music score accompanying it. We suspect this was created for the 1945 re-release of the film, which generally promoted the black stars more heavily than had been the case in 1934. 50.

These comments come from a survey of the ADW from 21 to 24 January; the ad appeared with print variations during this entire stretch, sometimes fea turing just the film's title, sometimes featuring pub licity stills (Washington pleading with Beavers to let her run away, (18 January 1935): 2); the shot with Colbert on the edge of the frame appeared in ADW (23 January): 3. 54.

There is also less of this so-called race preju dice and more of real art in the drama. Then, I guess I am what you call too independent to fool around with Hollywood producers. In New York, it is different. More businesslike. And if the Negro gets any sort of break in pictures it will be in pictures produced in New York where the question of race is not such a heavy item.' 63.

(This unsigned article also noted that 'Bea vers' role [in Imitation] is second in importance only to that of the star and gives her opportunities said to be exceptional'.) Again, even in a piece that acknowledges Beavers' role's subordinate status to Colbert's, the emphasis is on the serious and hu mane portrayal of Delilah's character in Imitation of Life. 64. Everett, 209-211. 65. 'Miss Beavers Knows Her Pancakes, So Director Says', ADW (30 January 1925): 2. 66. Bogle, Toms, Coons, Mulattoes..., 63. The following day the paper ran a photo of Beavers in her chef's cap at the pancake griddle in a bid to articulate, much as Donald Bogle would decades later, the view that Beavers transcended her role. Noting that the film had been held over yet again beyond its end date that day, the caption read Once a pancake, always a pancake' is Ned Sparks' description of Louis Bea vers ... but Miss Beavers proves that she is more than a "pancake" but a truly great artist of the screen'. Alongside this item was a short piece on how difficult it had been for Universal to find actors to play Delilah and Peola, particularly the latter, the role of 'a colored girl who would photograph white and a dark-skinned woman of known ability to play the difficult role of her mother'. Director Stahl and Universal, it was claimed, had staged a 'nation-wide search' for the parts; in fact, however, Beavers had appeared in Stahl's Only Yesterday a few months earlier. Here the plot summary added an interracial perspective by including both the white and black strands and a direct reference as to 'how their lives are interwoven'. The piece concluded by commenting that Imitation of Life gives Beavers 'her big chance of her career and lends her a role which will win much sympathy from the Race she portrays'. 67.

Significantly, as noted earlier, Hurst had acknow ledged that 'there are many aspects of [the film] that fall short or deviate or even malign my original theme'. Yet Hurst still accused Brown of resenting an 'out sider's' portrayal of black Americans, of articulating 'carping, petty angles of criticism' and of missing 'the wood for the trees': The important social value of this picture is that it practically inaugurates into the important medium of the motion-picture, a con sideration of the Negro as part of the social pattern of American life ... The attitude is ungrateful, but what is much more important, it is also unintelligent.' Sterling A. Brown and Fannie Hurst, Opportunity (April 1935), 121-122. We are grateful to Anna Everett for alerting us to the existence of this exchange. In his reply to Hurst's harsh rebuke, Brown pointed out that Hurst had overlooked his acknowledgement of Imitation of Life's landmark status. Then, too, he had no objections to imaginative portrayals of African Americans by non-black authors ('outsiders'). Fi nally, Brown observed, the novel and film's narrative both pu rported to portray 'typical ' African Americans ; but in fact, they projected stereotypical characters in the 'highly romanticized' characters of Peola and Delilah and their 'incredible' story. Acknowledging that 'there was a warmth of emotion in the mutual</page><page sequence="27">178 Matthew H. Bernstein and Dana F. White affection situations' between Bea and Delilah, he nonetheless reaffirmed that the black characters were derived from a debased tradition, and that 'pity' and 'sentimentality' towards them was 'not enough' to constitute a breakthrough. He was particularly harsh on Peola's characterization: ... The tragic mulatto, who adds to the cross borne by the long suffering saintly mammy, is likewise a fixture. She is so woe-begone that she is a walking argument against miscegenation; her struggling differentiates her unpleasantly from the self-abnegation of the mammy; her cheap yearning to be white is a contemptible surrender of integrity. Like her mammy, she contributes to Anglo-Saxon self-esteem. It is not easy to see any 'social value' in perpetuating these stock characters. As for the black stars' performances, he commented in conclusion, 'I am glad that Miss Washington and Miss Beavers had the chance to show their remark able talents; I think their performances were first-rate, but other roles could have called forth even better acting'. For an extended discussion of how the film was regarded by certain readers of Opportunity, as well as writers for the Pittsburgh Courier, see Everett, 219-232. As Everett has shown, readers of Oppor tunity took opposing views of the film in response to Brown's analysis. An editorial and columns in the Pittsburgh Courier likewise singled out diverse as pects of the film for praise .(the film's depiction of solid, dignified, upper middle-class black Americans and Peola's resonant demand, 'I want the same things other people enjoy'). Courier critic Bernice Patton argued that the overall impact of the film's black plot 'proves to white people that they have been unkind and unjust to their Ameri can brother of African descent. The picture gives them a more human understanding and love for the Negro.' Bernice Patton, 'Critics Weep at Preview of "Imitation of Life'", Pittsburgh Courier, 8 December 1934, quoted in Everett, 224-225. As Everett ob serves, the contrasting emphases that Patton and Jackson place on the two main black characters, Peola and Delilah, and the opportunity these roles presented to Washington and Beavers, testify to the diversity of views possible within the northern black press. 78.

Valentine, although himself a professional musician, praised the film's sparse use of music, because where 'previous films starring Negroes made over abundant use of Negro spirituals, Imitation of Life used only one, sung while Delilah was dying', one of the specific details Randall had dismissed; Valentine duly noted the other white music spotted at certain points in the film. 82.

Abstract: Imitation of Life in a segregated Atlanta: its promotion, distribu tion and reception, by Matthew H. Bernstein and Dana F. White Conducting primary research using local newspaper accounts of the opening of John Stahl's Imitation of I Life (1934), the authors compare and contrast the nature of the coverage of the film in black and white I newspapers. They also compare the film's mostly positive reception in black Atlanta with its generally I negative reception by African Americans in the North and Mid-West. The essay also includes extensive f discussion of the film's black stars, Louise Beavers and Fredi Washington. j[</page></plain_text>
