FURST CO., BALTIMORE, MARYLAND</page><page sequence="4">PREFACE In the following study an attempt is made to establish a series of types of Greek and early Roman terracotta lamps, and to publish representative examples of these types in a catalogue. The purpose of this work is not only to make known the definitive results of the excavations of the Athenian Agora as far as certain clay lamps are concerned, but also to furnish a reliable guide for archaeologists who may be able to use these types of lamps as criteria for dating deposits on other sites, wherever they may be in the Mediterranean area. The corpus of lamps from the Athenian Agora was assigned to the author in 1938, for eventual publication, by the late Professor T. Leslie Shear, Director of the Agora Excavations until his death. The Greek lamps found during the first seven years of excavation formed the basis for a doctoral dissertation accepted by the Johns Hopkins University in 1946, entitled " Greek Lamps from the Athenian Agora." The present study is an outgrowth of this dissertation, utilizing all of the material from subsequent seasons of excavation through the spring of 1954; it has been in process of compilation since 1950. The author would like to express his appreciation and very warm thanks to a number of people who have aided in the preparation of this book either by useful suggestions and valuable information or in other practical ways. These helpful friends include the senior scholars of the Athenian Agora, mentioned by name in the Introduction, and in addition Mr. Lucas Benachi, Professor Oscar Broneer, Mrs. Richard Erstein, Miss Sarah Elizabeth Freeman, Miss Anne Fuller, Miss Clairbve Grandjouan, Mrs. Margaret Larson Lethen, Mrs. Foti Likiardopoulo, Miss Anne McCabe, Mrs. William MacLean, Miss Judith Perlzweig, Mrs. Symington Perin, the late Professor David M. Robinson, Professor Richard Rowe, and Mrs. Evelyn L. Smithson. The profiles and the drawings of signatures, graffiti and dipinti are the work of Mrs. Aliki Bikakis, Mrs. Norman Herz, Mr. John Travlos and Professor John H. Young. The photographs are by Miss Alison Frantz. My special thanks go to Miss Lucy Talcott of the Agora Excavations whose work concerned with the deposit summaries and other lists appearing below should make this study more useful than it could otherwise be, and to Miss Lucy Shoe.

The year 86 B.C. is a convenient date for students of Athenian history to choose as a demar- cation between the Hellenistic and Roman periods in Athens. In that year Sulla's invasion of the city marked the beginning of Roman hegemony. All lamps made before 86 B.C. may be classed as Greek or Hellenistic, but even after that critical year a few Hellenistic forms continued to be made, well on into the middle years of the 1st century after Christ. A number of new types also developed after 86 B.c., depending upon the old tradition of late Hellenistic forms even though they were manufactured much later. All these survivals are included here, together with the small groups of wheelmade lamps that persisted long after 86 B.c., continuing a much earlier tradition. The increasingly popular moulded lamps, of Italian inspiration, which drove all earlier varieties from the Athenian market in the late 1st century after Christ, will be the subject of a separate study by Miss Judith Perlzweig; with this will appear also a study of plastic lamps which are essentially Roman rather than late Hellenistic, by Miss Claireve Grandjouan. It must be emphasized that this publication is selective; about one-third of the lamps inven- toried from the Agora Excavations are catalogued here. Lamps have been chosen for presentation here either because they come from contexts that contribute to the dating of the type, or because they are well preserved and furnish good illustrative material, because they bear signatures, graffiti or dipinti, or because they offer some unique feature, in which case they are usually classed as variants of standard types. This study is also selective in that it is concerned only with lamps that were made or used in Athens; it is not a comprehensive survey of all Greek lamps. When, however, lamps from other centers of production appear here as importations, the typological description or the catalogue will include some discussion of the probable places of origin. In a comparable manner, some attention is given to factors that indicate the export of Athenian lamps all over the Mediterranean area, since thousands of lamps, as well as decorated vases, were made in Attica for the export trade during a period of from five to six hundred years. Every available reference to a previous publication of an Attic lamp, whether found in Athens or elsewhere, will not, however, be cited here. Only those comparisons are utilized that contribute materially to a closer understanding of date or morphology or of the export trade. Lamps in other public or private collections are like- wise noted only when they have a contribution to bring to this study. Most of the lamps in the museums of Europe and the United States are standard types, with little clue as to provenance and seldom any hint of having been found in closed or dated deposits. Although there are several typologies of Greek lamps already in existence, the best known and most useful being that by Oscar Broneer based on the lamps found in the excavations at Corinth prior to 1930,' it has seemed desirable to devise yet another typology. The number and variety of Greek and Roman lamps found in the Agora Excavations have vastly exceeded those that 1 Corinth, Results of Excavations conducted by the American School of Classical Studies, Vol. IV, Part II, Terracotta Lamps, Cambridge, Mass., 1980. 1</page><page sequence="9">2 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS were available in Corinth at the time of Professor Broneer's study. It has been possible to recog- nize new types that had not occurred in Corinth, and also to establish as independent types some that were grouped together in the Corinth publication. The corpus of Greek and early Roman lamps that is there classified under nineteen types has been expanded into fifty-eight types, with some subdivisions, for the lamps from the Athenian Agora. To facilitate cross reference between the two publications, the Corinth classification, where a corresponding one exists, appears here in the heading to the discussion of each Agora type, and a concordance (p. 246) equates the Agora to the Broneer types. METHODS OF DATING AND ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL It would be folly to codify any such large number of types if there were only morphological changes to record. Happily the Agora Excavations have offered a valuable contribution: a means of dating more or less precisely this increased number of types. Over 1200 closed deposits, con- sisting of wells, cisterns, shafts, graves, building fills and other strata have been discovered since the beginning of the excavations in 1931; the majority of these have now been analyzed and dated on the internal evidence of pottery, ostraka, coins, etc., or the external evidence given byr their relation to buildings of known date such as the Stoa of Attalos. A large number of deposits contain lamps or lamp fragments which acquire the over-all dates assigned to the deposits. The dating suggested for the Agora types is thus in almost all cases based on two considerations: first, the circumstances of finding, where the piece comes from a closed or closely dateable deposit; and second, the stylistic relationships between the types and sub-types themselves. Most deposits contain more than one type of lamp. It must be emphasized that during any given decade, except in the early years when lamps first appeared, i. e. in the 7th century, the fabricants were producing several distinct varieties. Older craftsmen and shops would continue to produce styles familiar to them and to the customers in their youth; at the same time younger lamp-makers would offer developments that would lead to new types or would be easily influenced by foreign imports coming into Athens. At certain times, particularly in the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.c., competition was keen and rival shops competed for trade with many varieties of lamps. Thus, for instance, the household debris of a single family, accumulated over a period of ten to twenty years and thrown gradually into an abandoned well used as a dump, may easily contain fragments of eight to ten separate types of lamps. Since there is this overlapping of types within the individual deposits, a fairly precise dating of any single type may be obtained by analyzing the several deposits in which it occurs, and then choosing the period of overlap of the deposits for the years of the type's floruit. By applying this method a fairly restricted chronological range has been assigned to many of the Agora's fifty-eight types and subdivisions. A chart at the end of the volume shows graphically the duration as well as the overlap of the various types. This chart is designed to furnish a quick and accurate chronological table. Athenian lamps, widely exported in antiquity, are recognized as one of the most effective means of dating various deposits; it is hoped that this arrangement will increase their usefulness. The dates assigned to the individual types are the maximum over-all dates. Although some types flourished for short periods and others for very long times, it has not always been possible to define the exact years for all types. In such instances the widest possible extent of the type's floruit is noted, rather than the minimum number of years during which it was certainly current. The reader is cautioned against regarding the type numbers as a strict indication of chron- ology. This they could not in any case be, because of the overlap between types and the variation in length of life, as already noted. Moreover it has seemed advisable to follow a given line of development through to its end rather than to break a sequence by inserting lamps which although</page><page sequence="10">INTRODUCTION 3 contemporary may be otherwise unrelated to the types under discussion,. In particular it should be noted that the wheelmade lamps are carried on to their last appearance in the 1st century after Christ before the discussion of the moulded lamps, which first appear in the early 3rd century B.c., is undertaken. The chronological relationships between types may be best seen on the chart. The inclusive catalogue numbers of the lamps discussed in this publication are listed at the beginning of the discussion of each type; there is also a statement as to the number of others of the type included in the Agora inventory. The total serves to give a general indication as to which types were particularly rare and which most common in the Agora area. In the headings of some types there is given, in Roman numerals, the classification to which the type belongs in the typology developed by Broneer for the lamps of Corinth (Corinth, Vol. IV, Part II, Terracotta Lamps); this is useful since Broneer's types have been widely followed by scholars for a quarter century. Where no reference to one of Broneer's types appears it may be assumed that there is no counterpart among the lamps from Corinth published in his volume. In the catalogue which follows the discussion of each type the reader is referred by means of the deposit number2 to the Index of Deposits, pp. 234-245, where all lamps included in this study and coming from dated deposits are listed under their finding places. In all cases the date given for a deposit is its lowest limit. Where no context or deposit number is cited for a lamp, the reader may infer either that the deposit was not essential to the present purpose or else that it appeared in some way unreliable, as for instance in the case of contexts too late to be relevant or contexts the dating of which might have leaned heavily on the lamps themselves. For the Signed Bases the proportion of unlisted contexts is high, since the excavators have been at pains to preserve any fragment having a trace of an inscription, whether from a reliable deposit or not. The pottery and other material by which these deposits may be dated has in many cases already been published, either in whole or in part. In other cases the dates quoted are based on pre-publication studies by various students who have been or are now at work on material of different categories and periods from the Athenian Agora. For information cited in such cases I am particularly indebted to the co-operation of the following: Eva Brann, Peter E. Corbett, Vir- ginia Grace, G. Roger Edwards, Josephine Platner Harwood, Henry S. Robinson, Lucy Talcott, Dorothy Burr Thompson, Homer A. Thompson, Eugene Vanderpool and Rodney S. Young. No unpublished deposit is quoted here that has not been examined by one or more of these students; the dates will depend on pottery for the most part, but terracotta figurines, stamped handles from wine jars, ostraka and coins have also been taken into account. With the exception of Professor Thompson's introductory article,8 most of the Greek lamps from the Agora hitherto published have been presented in their contexts as parts of dated groups. Some of these lamps are republished here; for these, the prior references are given in the catalogue. Many others, however, have not been republished; for the types of these lamps, under the present classification, the reader is referred to the Concordance where are listed all the lamps which have provided the basis for this study. LAMP-MAKERS In studying the Greek lamps from the Agora one gains the impression that the lamp-maker was often so familiar with contemporary vases that he must have been producing them. Indeed 2 By relating the deposit numbers to their grid-squares on the plan, the reader can orient himself and can note for instance that certain areas of the market square of classical times had been settled in earlier eras as residential neighborhoods, or that the lower north slopes of the Areopagus were favorite sections for dwellings throughout classical antiquity. s Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 195-215.</page><page sequence="11">4 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS one might say that the Athenian potter very frequently was the fabricant of lamps also. Both crafts used the same clays and glazes; variations in the quality of clay or glaze seen on lamps follow closely the standards of the vases of any given period. Methods of manufacture were also the same: wheelmade lamps are contemporary with wheelmade pottery; the introduction of moulded lamps in the 3rd century B.c. coincides with the first great use of moulds for vases and bowls.' The occasional bits of painted or moulded decoration on lamps also find ready parallels on vases. And the profiles of many wheelmade lamps, especially of their bases and lower parts, are remarkably similar to those of contemporary vases. The student will find these simi- larities noted on the following pages, as well as the occasional signatures that are known both on lamps and vases from the Hellenistic period when moulded signatures first appeared on both products. INSCRIPTIONS Inscriptions of several types appear on lamps; they may be divided into two categories, those made before the lamp was fired and those made after firing. In the former group are the mono- grams or full names of fabricants that begin to appear in the second half of the 9nd century B.c. There is no proven instance of a maker's name appearing on a lamp before this period. All of these lamps with recognizable makers' names are mouldmade. The artisan sometimes inscribed his letters in the mould or on its matrix, especially in the case of finer products, so that the letters stand out on the bottom of the lamp in bold relief. Many fabricants, however, waited until the lamp was completely formed and then scratched the letters in the leather-hard clay before glazing and firing. In these cases the letters read correctly, from left to right. The raised letters scratched in the mould before the lamp was cast are sometimes retrograde on the finished product, when the maker had written from left to right in the mould. None of these inscriptions made on lamps before firing is anything but the name or device of the manufacturer. After a lamp was completed it may have received either a dipinto or a graffito. The painted inscriptions are rare: an early undecipherable and fragmentary one exists on 115 and another, late, example that refers to friendship appears on 464. Incised inscriptions, scratched through the glaze or into the clay after firing, are however fairly numerous. Many of them establish ownership, either by the first few letters of the owner's name or, more rarely, by the full name, written in the genitive. It is not easy to cut neatly formed letters into the hard black glaze of Attic wares, but Diokles, for instance, worked very carefully to cut not only his name but his family's badge, a boukranion, on 267. Other graffiti on lamps are plainly numbers, such as those on 280 and 300. These probably do not represent the prices of the individual lamps since the sums shown are very large. The figures may rather refer to inventories or to the number of examples of a kind of lamp to be ordered, maintained in stock, or sent out from a factory. In addition to names and numbers there are also seen on lamps occasional examples of erotic inscriptions and of humor; 175 has incised on it the word for runaway, referring perhaps to the fact that this lamp had been lost and was returned. Occasionally in the 5th century B.c. lamp fragments were used as ostraka; others seem to have served as schoolboys' practice tablets, with remains of abecedaria on them. LAMP TYPES In surveying the development of Greek and early Roman lamps one notes the gradual growth from the open saucer of Type 1 to the elaborately decorated closed bodies of the latest types. The very earliest examples of Greek lamp-making are the handmade and unglazed Types 1 and 2; 4 It should be noted however that both wheelmade and moulded lamps were sometimes made in the same shop; see the waster, 501, below, where both sorts have fused together in a kiln accident.</page><page sequence="12">INTRODUCTION 5 these flourished from the second quarter of the 7th century until well into the third quarter of the 6th century B.c. Their open pulled-out nozzles remained a standard characteristic of some later lamps, until the earliest years of the 5th century. The more usual closed-in bridged nozzle had, however, an early beginning with Type 9, which appeared in the third quarter of the 7th century. The first use of glaze on lamps coincided with the first use of the wheel for lamp-making, in Type 3, in the third quarter of the 7th century. This early use of glaze was confined to the interiors, to make the reservoirs somewhat less porous. The first use of glaze on the exteriors of lamps did not occur until Type 6 B appeared around the middle of the 6th century. Although both handmade and wheelmade lamps were produced concurrently from the third quarter of the 7th century until the third quarter of the 6th century, after that date only the wheel was used. It continued in lamp-making for a very long time, certainly until well within the 1st century after Christ, making its last appearance with Type 37 C. At an early date the introduction of moulded lamps began to give some competition to the wheelmade varieties. The first moulded lamps were plain adaptations of the wheelmade forms; they began with Type 42 A in the first quarter of the 3rd century B.c. These undecorated forms continued for some time, through Type 44 D which is as late as the middle of the 1st century after Christ. A more original kind of moulded lamp however, with decorations in relief that recall those of contemporary Megarian bowls, made its first appearance in the middle years of the 3rd century, with Type 45 A. Descendants of this type became increasingly popular throughout the 2nd and the 1st centuries B.C.; they lasted well into the third quarter of the 1st century after Christ. After that they were seen no more, and the story of the Greek lamp and its survivals is ended. NOTE In the text that follows, the measurements of the individual lamps include the diameters of the wheelmade lamps, but for the moulded lamps the widths are given, since they were not thrown on the wheel and theoretically are not perfect circles. The width does not include projecting knobs. Generally the subdivisions within a type, labelled A, B, C, correspond to morphological changes of the type that developed chronologically. But occasionally the subdivisions refer to differing varieties of the parent type; sometimes A, B, C are co-equal. The use of " Prime " is a device to show that lamps in these sub-groups have unglazed exteriors, but otherwise are nearly identical with the parent type that is fully glazed. In the Concordance and in the deposit summaries the symbol (') is used. Plaster restorations are noted, when they occur, in the descriptions of the individual lamps. The L numbers are inventory numbers. The following abbreviations are used for measurements: H. - Height W.- Width L. - Length D. - Diameter Pres. H. - Preserved height Pres.

Plates 1, 29. First quarter of the 7th century B.C. and probably into the fourth quarter. Dating based partly on the fact that the next type does not begin before the last quarter of the century (perhaps towards its end) and partly on the finding places. The earliest clay lamps found in Attica, after Mycenaean times, form a recognizable type that can be dated early in the 7th century. A vessel obviously designed for use as a lamp has yet to be recognized from the long succession of years stretching from the Submycenaean period down to 700 B.c.' The very rich collections of Geometric pottery from the Kerameikos Cemetery, Eleusis and the Athenian Agora have yielded no lamps. It seems evident that the use of oil for illumina- tion was one more of the developments among the major changes in Athenian economy and culture that occurred between 750 and 650 B.c.2 The style of pottery decoration changed markedly at this time, from Geometric to Protoattic, with an elaborate vocabulary of ornamentation derived from newly discovered eastern contacts. At this period Phoenician letters appeared in Greece,3 another close link with the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. It is entirely conceivable that the use of lamps was taken over with other cultural developments from Syria and Palestine. The hypothesis appears stronger when one compares the type of lamp common through the east during the 11th, 10th, 9th, and 8th centuries 4 with these first examples used in Attica during the 7th century. The shape is the same, with minor variations: an open saucer with the rim pinched in to form a rudimentary open nozzle for the wick. None of the Agora lamps seems to be an imported specimen; there is no exact parallel with an eastern lamp, largely because these local lamps have handles and are made of the local Attic clay that is also commonly used in coarse Protoattic cooking pots and water jugs. These lamps of Type 1 have the cocked hat shape, but the nozzle tends to be wider than is usual in their eastern antecedents. There is no emphasis on the rim. There is a simple flattened base and a vertical band handle reaching from the base to the edge of the rim opposite the nozzle. They are handmade without glaze or any added decoration. The clay is Attic, sometimes coarse with tiny air bubbles and micaceous particles, sometimes more smoothly worked and refined. Fragments of two lamps of this type were found on Mt. Hymettos 5 along with the inscribed sherds which are now dated in the early 7th century." A few others have occasionally come to light in other parts of Attica 7 but have passed unnoticed. Type 1 began sometime in the first quarter of the 7th century, and continued for a long time. 1 Athenaeus 700 e: ob araXatv pcvpqa AXvo,' 4X#oylt 8' o TaXaLoL tri) re SaaS Kal rwv aAMv $Awv EXpwvro. 2 Cf.

TYPE 2 A LAMPS WITH INCURVED RIMS, SHORT NOZZLES; UNGLAZED Nos. 5-7. Plates 1, 29. Late in 7th century B.c. into first quarter of 6th century. Unglazed lamps were probably used sporadically all through the 7th century, but the next recognizable type of unglazed lamp does not appear until the end of the century, when the use of oil for lighting became popular and a distinct type emerged; this has notable variations in profile that correspond to early and later developments over a period of approximately one hundred years. Type 2 A comprises a few examples that are the earliest and the least developed, covering approximately the last quarter of the 7th century down into the first quarter of the 6th. These lamps are handmade, roughly circular with flattened bases and shallow bodies. The simple incurving rim, a continuation of the sides, is narrow in comparison with that of later specimens in Type 2 B. The unbridged nozzle is very small, formed by pulling forward the wall of the lamp and adding a bit of clay to build it up; the edge of the nozzle is several millimeters higher than the edge of the rim. Slight traces of a simple vertical strap handle appear on 6; others of this group do not have the back portions preserved. These lamps are manufactured of coarse brownish red unglazed clay, similar to that of Type 1, but otherwise have no relationship morphologically to these predecessors, which were simple open saucers with a pinched nozzle. Type 2 A, with a definite incurving rim, marks the beginning of a new approach to lamp-making that set the general form for lamps during the next three hundred years, until the incurving rim developed into the completely covered top with only a small aperture left in the center as a filling-hole.</page><page sequence="15">TYPE 2 B 9 5 (L 3494).

TYPE 2 B LAMPS WITH INCURVED RIMS, LONG NOZZLES; UNGLAZED Nos. 8-20 (and 27 others inventoried). Plates 1, 29. Late 7th century B.c. into late 6th century. Type 2 B is a large group that was popular in Athens 8 for three generations. In form it is a development of Type 2 A. The lamps themselves are inclined to be larger, their sides are higher and enclose more of the body; sometimes the profiles have a single curve, but more character- istically the outward curve of the lower part of the lamp and the curving upper part that forms the rim are treated as two separate elements, with a sharp angle at their junction, like that of a clamshell. The articulations between bottom, lower body, and upper body are exceptionally clear on some lamps, such as 19, with the clay pared to sharp and well defined angles while in a leather-hard state. Some of the later lamps, 14 and 20 for instance, have a well defined edge around the rim that gives a more finished appearance to the lamp and is analogous to the definition given to rims in contemporary glazed varieties. The simple bases are the same as those in Type 2 A, but the nozzles are broader and longer. All the lamps of Type 2 B seem to have had handles; the majority are flat vertical loop handles made rather thickly, attached at the junction of the lower and upper curves of the body and at the flat base, with the result that in some cases the bottom of the handle is actually lower than the bottom of the lamp. This gives a certain unsteadiness, although it serves the purpose of tipping the lamp slightly forward so that the oil is thus concentrated in the forepart and nozzle. A few have small horizontal handles, circular in section, and attached at the angle between the upper and lower halves of the body. Lamps of this type are usually undecorated but there are some exceptions; 8 and 9 have punched dots and scratched lines, made in the wet clay, with an attempt at pattern.' These decorated lamps are early within the type. The clay of Type 2 B lamps is usually a light dull red, coarse and thick, with many air bubbles, micaceous fragments, and foreign particles; in some s These lamps are common in Athens, not seen elsewhere. Cf. nos. 5758 and 5769 from the Acropolis, formerly in the Acropolis Museum and now stored in the National Museum. There are scores of additional uninventoried specimens in the latter museum. 9 Six similar lamps, unpublished, were found by Broneer in a 6th century well on the North Slope of the Acropolis in 1938. No. 5774 in the Acropolis Museum is similarly decorated and others exist, uncatalogued, from the Acropolis and now in the National Museum in Athens. Comparable incised decoration is seen on contemporary pottery (Hesperia, Suppl. II, pp. 189-190, C 157 - C 159, C 161 - C 164, fig. 139).</page><page sequence="16">10 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS examples it is smoother and purer.1" The mixture often wears poorly, with a tendency to break and flake. A few specimens have a dull gray color, caused by misfiring. The source of the clay is probably Attica although Aegina has been tentatively suggested.1' These handmade lamps seem to have served adequately without benefit of glaze or paint, although their extreme porosity must have made them annoying at times. They were very popular, because of their cheapness, despite the fact that more suitable lamps with glaze were being made during these years; Types 4, 5, and 6 are their more sophisticated contemporaries. By the last quarter of the 6th century these sturdy unglazed lamps were driven from the market, yielding way entirely to glazed lamps except for a few small and sporadic later types that are uncon- nected with the tradition of Types 2 A and B. 8 (L 1942).

Related to Type 2 B is this pair of handmade unglazed lamps of the same clay, but with a marked development in the profile. The incurving rim encloses much more of the body than normally, and is finished with a very pronounced collar, grooved or flat on top. Each of these lamps had the conventional vertical strap handle, but since the front is preserved in neither case, it is difficult to tell much about the nozzles. One might suppose that the nozzle was bridged, because the lamps seem generally enclosed and it would be awkward to make the transition be- tween the high collar and an open nozzle. In the second half of the century there must have been numerous transitional pieces like these, as lamps developed from the open saucer type to more enclosed forms. 21 (L 670). Pls. 1, 29.

Plates 1, 29. Late third quarter and last quarter of the 7th century B.C. The lamps of this type are similar in shape to those of Type 1, but they are wheelmade and have glazed interiors. Here is the earliest use of the wheel and glaze in Greek lamp production. There is a flattened circular bottom from which the saucer-like flaring sides spread to form the body. The nozzle is pinched in like the nozzle of Type 1, and opposite there may be a flat vertical handle. None of the Agora examples preserves its handle; 23 certainly never had one, nor did 24. The other inventoried lamps may have had handles like those of Type 1.12 The pinkish buff clay is Attic, but of a poor consistency, inclined to flake and wear badly.

The base is flat and from it rise the curving walls of the body, more rounded than in the preceding type; the tops of the side walls are turned back, making a flat rim overhanging the outside of the lamp. In one early example, 26, this flat rim does not overhang, but is merely the flattened top of the thick walls. In a later example, 29, the overhanging rim has a pronounced flare, rather than the normal appearance. The nozzle is pinched in and drawn out, like that of Type 3; the handle, in all cases where enough remains to show the form, is horizontal and ribbon-like, some- 12 An unpublished lamp of Type 3, with a handle comparable to that of Type 1, was found on Mt.

This use of the kothon handle, as well as the more developed body shape, suggests that the lamp-makers were familiar with the wares of the potters; indeed it is very possible that lamps were turned out by potters, at least in these earlier periods, and that there were few or no separate manufacturers of lamps. Continually during the next six hundred years there will be seen many analogies between lamps and pots, in the use of clays and glazes as well as in decorative elements; the Hellenistic period will bring forth many moulded decorations in relief that are the same on both lamps and bowls. All the lamps of Type 4 are wheelmade. They are of buff or pinkish buff clay that usually looks characteristically Attic; the fabric of 25 could possibly be Corinthian. Invariably the outside is unglazed, but a reddish brown glaze is used for the interiors and the upper surfaces of the overhanging rims, as well as for parts of the tops of the handles. The type had a fairly long life, and it held the field alone with few other varieties of glazed competitors. The next groups of glazed lamps followed rather than paralleled, with pronounced changes in their shapes. 25 (L 3375). H. 0.025 m.

Plates 2, 30. Second quarter and into fourth quarter of the 6th century B.C. This very distinctive 6th century type shows the manufacturers progressing from simpler varieties to a developed and even sophisticated form that reflects, more than in the preceding type, the skill of the professional potters. There is a remarkable uniformity among several specimens of Type 5 (30, 31, 32), which suggests that these may all be the product of a single shop, the atelier of a craftsman who was cognizant of the thin fabrics and neat use of glaze that characterize much of the pottery of this period.3 The base may be slightly concave and raised just perceptibly as in 32 or, more usually, there is no base at all; the slightly flattened bottom then makes a continuous curve into the wall of the lamp and ends in a rim overhanging the interior. All of these lamps are wheelmade, but the nozzle in every case is made by cutting away a portion of the wall and adding a spoon-shaped projection. A horizontal loop handle appears frequently. Several of the earlier lamps have the kothon handle seen on Type 4, or a variant, as on 33, which marks the transition from the kothon handle to the standard horizontal U-shaped loop handle. Two lamps, 34 and 37, have a circular collar or a raised rim around the central opening; these slight variations from the normal profile anticipate the rim developments of Type 20. The fabric is a finely worked Attic clay, heavy and thick in some examples which are early within the type, but thinner in most of the specimens. A neat brownish black glaze is used judiciously on the interior, inside and around the edge of the nozzle, on top of the handle, and often as a decorative border around the edge of the rim. Sometimes the painted border around the edge of the rim is replaced by a decorative circle of glazed dots or dashes." 30 (L 2678). Pls. 2, 30. H. 0.031 m.; D. 0.085 m.

TYPE 6 A LAMPS WITH FLAT RIMS; OPEN NOZZLES; PARTIALLY GLAZED Nos. 38-42 (and 6 more inventoried). Plates 2, 30. Ca. middle years of 6th century B.c. Dating based on the fact that Type 6 A is stylistically somewhat less developed than Type 6 B which flourished during the second half of the 6th century, and on the finding places of two lamps. A large number of 6th century wheelmade lamps, with open nozzles and horizontal band handles, and with a certain emphasis on their flat rims, may be grouped together in two categories. The earlier and less developed group forms Type 6 A. This group of lamps has a flat or slightly concave bottom, with the inner floor of the lamp correspondingly flat or rising to a low elevation in the center. Thick side walls rise nearly straight, although the profile is actually curved slightly. The tops of the thick walls are flattened and project a bit as a rim, normally horizontal and somewhat overhanging. The body is thus very open, and from it projects a large handmade nozzle attached at an opening cut in the wall. At the opposite side is a horizontal band handle with broad projections for attaching it to the body of the lamp. The clay is Attic, and the walls are usually massive. The use of glaze especially distinguishes these lamps from those of Type 6 B; it is applied throughout the interior, but is sparingly used on the rim or body, confined to concentric bands that leave parts of these areas undecorated; the inside of the nozzle is of course glazed, as well as its outer edge; occasionally all of its exterior is painted. 38 (L 4700).

Plates 2, 30. Middle of 6th century B.C. to end of century. This second subdivision is somewhat more advanced in shape and date. The form is a develop- ment of that seen in Type 6 A. The bottom is flat, or slightly concave, or slightly raised. The walls are pronouncedly curved and in some examples have a nearly angular profile, enclosing much of the body of the lamp. The flat rim is conspicuous, often sloping markedly inwards. The tendency is toward a closed oil reservoir. The open nozzle remains the same handmade feature as on Type 6 A, added to a cut-out section of the body of the lamp. The horizontal band handle is small and thick; it seems almost too small to be serviceable in carrying the lamp, but would have served adequately to hang the lamp on a peg, when not in use. There are no long projections or ears, as seen occasionally on handles of lamps of Type 6 A (41 is a good example), which were vestiges of the kothon-type handle of Type 5. The fabric is of fairly heavy well worked Attic clay. A few of the earlier lamps, around the middle of the 6th century, have unglazed exteriors but are decorated with glaze around the rims and the nozzles. Most of Type 6 B, however, shows a use of thick lustrous black glaze all over the exterior and interior. This is the earliest appearance of fully glazed lamps and marks a definitive step forward in utility, since a glazed exterior diminishes the porosity of the fabric and the seepage of oil. A few lamp-makers, however, allowed the bottoms of their products to remain unglazed, while covering the outer walls completely as well as the interiors. If a lamp were suspended on the wall from a peg, and hung with its interior toward the wall, the unglazed bottom would be rather decorative as a contrast to the glazed sides. A further interest in deco- ration is the occasional use of an added band of purple paint around the rim, as on 46; this is the same kind of purple that is frequently added to contemporary black-glazed vases and shows</page><page sequence="23">TYPE 6 B 17 another close link between pottery and lamps. The thick black glaze that covers most of the lamps of Types 6 A and 6 B is decidedly different from the thin reddish brown glaze of Type 5; this black glaze is typical of that used on black-figured pottery, as the reddish brown is char- acteristic of that used on Protoattic pottery. 43 (L 4191).

Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 6 B and, to some extent, on the finding places. Lamps of this category are related in general appearance to those of the preceding type; the characteristic feature, however, is a curved side wall rising from a flat base and ending with an incurving rim; this feature is closely allied to the curving side wall of lamps of Type 5. In the thickness of wall, however, and the all-over use of black glaze (except for the bottom) Type 7 is more akin to Type 6 B. Type 7 lamps are wheelmade like their immediate predecessors, have an open nozzle and a thick horizontal band handle. None of the Agora specimens preserves all of these features, but the appearance of a complete lamp may be obtained by combining fragmentary bits of evidence from several lamps. This type flourished during the last quarter of the 6th century, and well into the 5th. Similar features reappeared after the Persian destruction of 480-479 B.c., in Type 20, which is marked by curving sides and a full use of black glaze, but has a short bridged nozzle below a continuous circular rim, rather than an open nozzle. 53 (L 3989).

Dating based on the finding places. Individual lamps may be more closely dated by their own finding places or by stylistic similarities with lamps of preceding types, as noted below. The lamps assembled in Type 8 have unique and distinctive features which prevent them from being classed with any of the foregoing types; they differ from one another so radically that they may be grouped together only in a miscellaneous classification of 7th and 6th century varia. Their only common element is the open nozzle. One, 58, is the result of caprice on the part of a workman who was surely a potter rather than a full-time lamp-maker. 57 is part of a large sanctuary lamp, and might be classed with Type 41 were it not for its distinctive open nozzle that places it very close to Type 2 B.

A triangular point preserved, with complete profile; broken away behind; a slight rise in the floor at one of the other angles indicates that the rear wall rose near this point and shows that most of the lamp is preserved; it was an equilateral tri- angle with perhaps additional nozzles at the other two angles. The one nozzle partially preserved projected little if any from the rounded angle and was presumably unbridged; handmade of buff clay, gray at the core; thin brown glaze inside; on the two outer walls that are preserved a broad band of same glaze at bottom, above which, on one wall preserved to full height, a frieze appar- ently of schematic water birds with a thin band of glaze at top. There are no known parallels for such an early lamp with decorations similar to those on contemporary pottery. The frieze of birds has parallels on pottery earlier than the 6th century.

The clay is Attic, and the lamp appears as one of the earliest examples extant, sharing honors with lamps of Type 1 for being the first after the Mycenaean period and the subsequent dark Geo- metric epoch.

The first clay lamps with bridged nozzles appeared in Attica at a very early date, but some time after the introduction of the lamp itself as an item of household furniture. The bridged nozzle in Athens did not evolve slowly and develop ultimately out of the open-nozzle varieties, and we have seen in the previous sections that the open nozzle by itself is not a sign of an early date. Around the middle of the 7th century a separate development in lamp-making started that 15 Skyphoi: P 7157 and P 7458; Hesperia, Suppl. II, p. 148, nos. C 28 and C 27, figs. 109, 103.

This new development was perhaps the work of a potter who conceived of a lamp as a low pot or shallow rounded bowl, with the nozzle as a separate feature attached to the wall of the bowl and surrounding a hole pierced through the wall for the admission of a wick. This concept is quite distinct from the original form of the lamp as a flaring open saucer with the nozzle simply formed by manipulating part of the side wall into a trough for the wick."8 Only in later forms of the open nozzle types is there a resemblance to the enclosed forms, with profiles more rounded and with definitive flat rims or copings crowning the walls. For over a hundred and fifty years, from ca. 650 B.C. to ca. 490 B.C., both types of lamp were used before the closed or bridged nozzle finally gained complete domination of the markets. These 7th century lamps with bridged nozzles, the earliest to be seen in Attica, are wheelmade. The bottom is flat, without any raised base, the side walls are curved and crowned by a flat rim, overhanging the interior and sometimes grooved. The distinctive feature is the hole pierced in the wall, well below the rim, and surrounded on the outside by a small handmade nozzle. The top of the walls of the nozzle are several milli- meters below the level of the lamp's rim; this feature gives to the nozzle the appearance of an afterthought, added to the side of a low enclosed bowl. One lamp preserves a bit of one end of its horizontal handle. Other lamps may have been made without handles or may have had vertical loop handles.19 Type 9 is an importation from Asia Minor.20 The clay is a pale pink, in texture and color very similar to Attic clay. Some examples of Type 9 were certainly made in the Smyrna area, others perhaps were manufactured locally in Athens, following closely the imported prototype. 62 has a crude circle scratched in the leather-hard clay of the nozzle where it joins the lamp. This circle or omicron is a characteristic graffito on local Smyrna fabrics,21 and may be a potter's initial or some sort of trade mark. This same lamp had its lower walls pared with a blunt instrument while the clay was soft. It is certainly an imported item. The glaze on Type 9 is fugitive; two examples preserve none at all, while 61 has slight traces of glaze, partly red and partly black, on both its interior and exterior walls. This imported type, with a developed form related to pottery shapes and introducing the bridged nozzle, was a marked contrast to the contemporary Athenian product, viz. Type 2 B; the local lamps were primitive by comparison and poorly adapted for containing oil and holding the wick apart from the reservoir. The limited number of Type 9 that is preserved shows that its use was confined to a few individuals, but it started a trend that was to become common in all later forms of both cheap and expensive lamp production. 60 (L 3376).

Late 7th century B.C. into second quarter of 6th century B.C. A somewhat more advanced phase of lamp-making is seen in a group of examples that preserve many of the characteristics of Type 9 but have nozzles of a form that was to become normal; that is, the enclosure around the wick-hole and surrounding the aperture in the wall of the lamp is approximately level with the rim, instead of being considerably lower. All of these lamps are wheelmade (with one handmade exception, 67), unglazed, with flat bottoms and curving side walls topped by narrow flat rims. Two preserve intact their broad thin vertical strap handles, while all the other examples are fragmentary and lack their back portions; they also may have had similar handles. The nozzles are large and ovular with comparatively thin walls; they are made by hand and carefully joined to the body of the lamp and the edge of the rim, upon which they do not encroach; marks of a wooden tool are sometimes observable at the juncture of nozzle and body, and similar traces of paring the clay while in a leather-hard condition appear on the sides of at least one example (67). The clay of Type 10 varies in different lamps. Its complexion is always light, but three varieties may be noted. Some of our lamps are of Attic clay, a very pale pinkish buff with a soft consistency and tendency to flake. One lamp (65) is certainly of Corinthian clay, buff with the familiar pale greenish cast; another (66) is perhaps of Corinthian clay, pale buff but without the greenish tint of the standard Corinthian products. Another, 67, is handmade rather than turned on the wheel and has a slightly orange tone; its surface was pared with a blunt instrument while in a leather-hard state. This pale orange buff clay with pared surfaces is very similar to " Argive Monochrome Ware," a pottery fabric found in quantities at the Argive Heraion, and recognized as local.22 A similar fabric has been found also in smaller quantities, in Corinth,28 and the Phaleron Cemetery; 24 vases of this fabric are also not uncommonly found in Athens,25 but few lamps. Type 10 lamps found in Corinth seem always to be of the local buff Corinthian clay.26 67 is an Argive 22 A temple deposit, excavated in 1949 by J. L. Caskey and P. Amandry at the Heraion, contained scores of small hydriai and jugs of this fabric. For a full discussion of the fabric see J. L.

Pending further knowledge concerning lamp-making activities near Argos it must be presumed that Corinth, very active in this field in the later 7th century, furnished the model for both Argos and Athens. Throughout the 7th century many Attic imitations of Corinthian pottery were made in Athens; 27 no examples of Corinthian vases imitating Attic have come to light in this area. There is no reason to believe, then, that the lamps made in the northern Peloponnesos were sent to Athens to compete with a local style; rather the local version copies the imported examples, just as so many elements in Protoattic pottery were derived from Corinthian prototypes. The origin of Type 10 is Corinthian, with a reproduction of the type in or near Argos as well as in Athens. 63 (L 3767). Pls. 3, 31. H. 0.026 m.; Pres. L. ca. 0.056 m.

The center of the base, however, is pulled up into a hollow tube or socket that has its top at approximately the height of the outer walls of the lamp. These lamps are all preserved in fragmentary condition, but there is evidence 28 to show that the normal example had no handle and but one nozzle, comparable to the oval bridge nozzle used in the preceding type and placed just outside the rim. In lamps of Type 11 there is again evidence for Corinthian originals and Attic adaptations. The clay of 68 is pale buff Corinthian with a pared surface; the other lamps are of the typical pinkish buff Attic clay; all the lamps are wheelmade and completely unglazed. The central tube or socket in the center of these specimens is not for the insertion of a pointed standard as is often surmised; there are no signs of wear within the tube, and a glance at the profile of 68 will show that the aperture is irregularly made and actually smaller at the bottom than its maximum width within. Nor was the tube designed to facilitate hanging the lamp by suspension, with a cord passing through the tube and knotted at its end or tied around an object larger than the diameter of the tube; if this were true, the lamp would tip precariously to one side since its single nozzle has no counterbalance,29 and again there are no signs of wear around the bottom of the tube.3" The fact that these lamps have no handles leads to the belief that the central tube is simply a convenient finger hole to aid in grasping firmly and carrying safely a slippery lighted lamp. The central tube is equally useful for hanging the lamp on a peg by means of a cord passed through the tube. The central opening is a miniature variant of the open center seen in large sanctuary lamps of Type 8, as Thompson has pointed out in considering later lamps with similar features." There are no earlier manifestations or predecessors of the central tube. It occurs in these small lamps synchronously with the first appearances of the large corona sanctuary lamps, and seems to have been spontaneously devised by Corinthian lamp-makers in the later years of the 7th century B.C. 68 (L 1658).

Plates 3, 31. Corinth: classified under Type II. Second and third quarters of 6th century B.c. Dating based on the continuation of the rim design of Types 9, 10, 11 and on the finding places. While the open nozzle lamps of coarse unglazed fabric were those most commonly used during the major part of the 6th century, more carefully made types continued to be introduced with bridged nozzles and a modified use of glaze. Lamps of Types 10 and 11 are succeeded, in the second quarter of the century, by a newer form that has several varieties. Type 12 A is the earliest of these and shows a development in profile and use of glaze. The bottom is flat but rises in the center into a conical concavity that is seen on the interior floor of the lamp as a central conical protuberance.32 The side walls are thick and either angular or curved, topped by a very emphatic flat rim that overhangs the interior of the lamp and projects on the exterior over the side walls; the rim is normally embellished with a raised ridge around its outer edge. None of our examples preserves its back portion entirely, so it is impossible to say definitely whether a handle was used. Very probably none existed, since it would be difficult to design a handle that would be suitable with the ridged rim and it is certain that no handle is used on Type 12 B which is morphologically related to Type 12 A."3 The raised cone in the base is an adaptation of the central tube and used for the same purpose, to serve as a finger hole for a secure grasp on the lamp when carrying it. In this respect there is a strong relationship to vase design: the hollow raised boss of the mesomphalic phiale which also serves as a depression, on the under side, for the fingers.3" The nozzle of Type 12 A is broad and thick, with its base on a level with the bottom of the body of the lamp; the oval aperture extends close to the rim. The clay seems to be Attic; all the lamps are wheelmade. In the use of glaze there is a nice combination of the practical and the aesthetic, since a thin brownish red glaze is used throughout the interior to keep the porous clay from absorbing the oil, and for the same reason the entire exterior of the nozzle is dipped in glaze; paint is used elsewhere on the exterior only for a thin decorative line or lines around the top of the rim." Such a line is usually around the inner edge of the rim and emphasizes the transition between the plain exterior and glazed interior. 32 This central projection, or mesomphalos, is referred to in the Batrachomyomachia (line 129, Homeri Opera, T. W. Allen ed., Oxford, 1912), where the mice arm themselves and use the mesomphaloi of lamps as shields. No lamps with these central projections existed before the second quarter of the 6th century B.C., which gives a terminus post quem for the poem. Central features like these of Type 12 A continued, however, throughout the 6th century. 3, Five inventoried lamps of Type 12 A preserve considerable stretches of their walls that are from parts of circumferences beyond the nozzles, and none has any trace of a handle. A similar lamp from Berezanj (an island in the Black Sea) is intact; it has no handle. See Arch. Anz., 1910, col. 227, fig. 26, where it is dated in the second half of the 6th century. Two lamps of this type from a well in Corinth dated 600-540 B.c. have no handle (Hesperia, XXV, 1956, p. 372, nos. 89, 90, fig. 2, pl. 59). 34 Although metal mesomphalic phialai are found in the 9th century and earlier, clay examples in Attica are not known until the second half of the 6th century. See Heinz Luschey, Die Phiale, Bleicherode am Harz, Carl Nieft, 1939. 5 An exceptional example, 75, has glaze on the entire rim and upper part of the body's exterior.</page><page sequence="32">26 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS 71 (L. 1490).

Corinth: classified under Type II. Late third and fourth quarters of 6th century B.c., perhaps into early years of 5th century. Dating based partly on stylistic similarities to Type 19 A, partly on the dates of recently dis- covered examples of Type 12 B in Corinth,"8 and in part on the finding places of several specimens in the Agora. This more advanced variety of Type 12 shows an early use of a well defined raised base instead of the usual flat bottom; it is actually a kind of broad base ring, since the concavity in the center is present, projecting into a cone in the interior of the lamp as in Type 12 A. The sides rise above the base in two clearly defined steps, the lower more spreading and nearly hori- zontal, the upper curved but approaching the vertical. The rim overhangs the interior only, and is flat without ridges. There is never a handle; the flat-topped nozzle is broad and set fairly high in the upper part of the wall without encroaching on the rim, with which its top is flush. Glaze is applied in the same manner as in Type 12 A, in the interior and around the exterior of the nozzle; there are very carefully drawn concentric glazed circles around the rim. A good deal more taste and skill is evidenced in these neatly made lamps than in their predecessors, showing that the manufacture of lamps was now in the hands of very competent craftsmen used to some of the refinements seen in contemporary glazed pottery; lamps no longer are pedestrian and merely utilitarian wares. The Attic clay of Type 12 B is a smooth hard pinkish buff, remarkably free from impurities and ideally adapted to precise workmanship. The glaze is brown to black. 36 A well excavated in 1947 in Corinth yielded an example, CL 3918 (unpublished); the well has been dated by its pottery in the third quarter of the 6th century s.c. (Hesperia, XVI, 1947, p. 237). Another lamp in Corinth is from a well with contents dated between 550 and 480 B.c.

Plates 3, 32. Ca. second to third quarters of 6th century B.c. Dating based on stylistic relationships with Types 11 and 16 B and on the finding place of 83. Type 13 consists of a small number of lamps that seem to be transitional between Type 11, which was unglazed with narrow overhanging rims, and Type 16, partially glazed and with broader overhanging rims. These transitional lamps have flat bottoms without any central hole or cavity, rather high curving sides, and very narrow, slightly convex, rims that are set off from the walls and overhang the interior. There is evidence that they possessed horizontal bar handles, very much like the similar handles on contemporary unbridged lamps of Type 5. None of our examples possesses a nozzle intact. The clay is uniformly Attic pinkish buff, used in a thin fabric; there are horizontal ridges around the body made by paring the leather-hard clay. A dark brown glaze is used throughout the interiors and on the rims as well as on the handles. Presumably the exteriors of the nozzles were decorated with glaze also, as on Types 5, 12 A, 12 B, 16 A, and 16 B. The exterior side walls are unglazed. 82 (L 2702). Pls. 3, 32. H. 0.023 m.; Est.

Corinth: classified under Type II. Last quarter of 6th century B.C. and into early years of 5th century. Dating based on the finding place of two examples in Corinth,37 as well as on the finding places of 84 and 85. This type of wheelmade late 6th century lamp with a vertical loop handle originated in Corinth and was probably copied in Athens. The extant examples are preserved in very frag- mentary condition at both places, but enough evidence remains to show definite characteristics of a separate type. The base is presumably flat, without a central cone, and the low sides curve up and around to form a narrow rim; in one example, 85, the sides are slightly ribbed, and this lamp has a narrow flat rim overhanging both the exterior and interior, as on lamps of Type 10. A distinguishing feature of Type 14 is the broad vertical loop handle, again reminiscent of Type 7 From a well with pottery dating between 550 and 500 B.c.

An unusual form of unglazed handmade lamp, combining both archaic and advanced elements, is introduced toward the end of the 6th century.38 Its appearance is surprising because of its apparently primitive aspect after a series of more sophisticated developments in both the bridged and unbridged nozzle types, yet when one considers carefully certain features it seems much in advance of its period. Like most earlier lamps, Type 15 has a flat circular bottom brought up into incurving side walls. There is no rim, although the bevelled edge around the top of the thin walls serves as an adequate finish. A very broad and thin vertical handle like that of Type 10 is used on every lamp of which the back is preserved. The nozzle form is most interesting, since on some it is a broad, long, boat-shaped open nozzle, and on others (the majority) it is closed. There is little difference in date between the two forms of nozzle, and this is the only type of Greek lamp in which both appear. The closed nozzle is very long and seems to swell out into an oval protuberance in which is placed the large wick-hole. This nozzle is simply an enclosed version of the open one; the sides are pulled somewhat together at the neck and extended up to join and form a closed tube; the end is left with its original breadth, so that it only seems to swell out of a narrower neck; actually it is the neck that is drawn in. The clay of these lamps shows them to be non-Attic. The fabric is remarkably susceptible to changes of color under different firing conditions; it may be pink at the core and buff outside, or red at the core and gray outside; sometimes it is brown all through. It is frequently very hard, free of mica, but is apt to have occasional air bubbles; the surface is always finished in a distinctive way by paring, that is by trimming the surfaces with a blunt instrument while the clay is leather- hard. This clay has analogies with that used in a series of wine jars and in other household wares from Corinth,39 which show similar wide variations in color, due to firing conditions. The clay of 8 In Corinth this type has been found only after 1930, since the publication of Broneer's Terracotta Lamps. One unpublished example found in Corinth in 1939, CL 3959, comes from a well dated by its excavator in the early 5th century B.C. 39 For this fabric see most recently Hesperia, XXII, 1958, pp. 98-94, nos. 106-109, and pp. 108-109, no. 166;</page><page sequence="36">30 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS Type 15 may be Corinthian and the supposition that the lamps were imported from that city is strengthened by the similarity of their handles to those of Corinthian lamps of Type 10.

Type 16 consists of a very large number of wheelmade lamps that have one predominant characteristic in common, the flat or slightly convex rim that overhangs the exterior and a great and the references there. In Athens, wine jars in this fabric appear at least as early as the first half of the 6th century B.C. 0o Perhaps its apparent scarcity here is due to the fact that comparatively few early 5th century well deposits or masses of household debris have been excavated. 41 Uninventoried examples exist from both places, one in the store rooms of the Kerameikos Excavations and one in the National Museum. 2 Heesperia, VII, 1938, p. 610, no. 235, figs. 30, 31.</page><page sequence="37">TYPE 16 B 31 deal of the interior. There are several subdivisions of this type according to place of manufacture and width of rim. The earliest, Type 16 A, is a group of lamps from Corinth, apparently exported from there in some quantity during the first half of the 6th century B.C. In this period the exportation of Attic pottery had not yet grown to the volume that would be normal later in the century; Corinthian wares still had wide markets, and numbers of lamps were included in ship- ments to Athens and other centers of trade. Some of these Corinthian lamps were to be copied soon by Athenian manufacturers (Type 16 B) and a little later there occurred an interesting phenomenon: the Attic copy of the Corinthian original was copied in Corinth, after trade con- ditions had been reversed and Athens had become the prime exporter; this was later in the 6th century." Type 16 A, the Corinthian prototype, is represented by fragmentary examples in the Agora. Their bottoms are not preserved, but examples found in Corinth show them to be flat or slightly concave; this is normal for the later Athenian lamps of Type 16 B that copy Corinthian originals. The comparatively low curving sides are topped by a broad flat rim." There is no handle; the nozzle is made separately, by hand, with a large hole that encroaches slightly, if at all, on the wide rim. Both the profiles and the nozzle forms show a distinct relationship to Type 10. The clay is typically Corinthian, pale buff with yellow or green tones. Glaze is conspicuously absent from the interior, but is used decoratively in dark brown concentric bands around the rim. The end of the nozzle was dipped in glaze, so that color appears both on its exterior and interior; this was done for a practical reason, to avoid absorption and discoloration from the burning wick that would otherwise create an untidy appearance on the pale porous clay. 92 (L 3106).

Corinth: classified under Type II. Last quarter of 6th century B.C. and down to ca. 480. A very common type of lamp during the late 6th century and the early 5th is an Athenian version of Type 16 A. This new group, Type 16 B, is also closely related in profile and use of glaze to Type 13, of which it seems to be a development. The general characteristics of Type 16 B show a close adaptation of its Corinthian prototype. There is a slightly concave bottom that rises into low curving sides topped by a flat or nearly flat 4 See 118 (Type 16 Variants). * In some examples the rim seems to have been made separately, on the wheel, and joined to the top of the walls while both were leather-hard. This process anticipates that used in later 3rd century B.C. mouldmade lamps, in which the top and bottom were made separately and joined.</page><page sequence="38">32 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS overhanging rim. In the earlier examples the walls are low and the rim narrow; in the later, the walls are somewhat higher and the rim much broader, covering a large proportion of the interior of the lamp so that it appears more like a flat top with a central aperture than a rim. This is an important step in the ever-growing tendency to enclose the body of the lamp more and more, as lamp forms develop in the 6th and throughout the 5th centuries until the oil reservoir is com- pletely enclosed except for a small central filling-hole. Type 16 B has no handle,4" following again the example set by Type 16 A. The nozzle is broad, coming to a narrow rounded termination, with a large oval wick-hole that may or may not intrude slightly onto the rim; there is no chronological significance in the presence or absence of such an intrusion. The Attic clay of these lamps is partially covered with a good black glaze that sometimes, owing to conditions of firing, appears brown or red. The glaze is uniformly used throughout the interior, on the rim, and around the exterior of the nozzle in a neatly defined line. The remainder of the lamp, bottom and side walls, shows a diluted glaze wash, buff to orange or red in color. This was applied thickly or thinly to the entire exterior of the lamp before the black glaze was added on rim and nozzle. The two coatings became fused together; on some lamps the glaze is flaky and worn away due to unusual firing conditions, and the undercoating of glaze wash is missing too, although present on adjacent surfaces that were not also decorated with glaze; 101 shows an example of this. An occasional lamp, such as 102, may show an irregular circle on the rim where the glaze has fired orange or red; this blemish was caused by stacking in the kiln, which kept some of the heat away from the area on which the upper lamp rested. The earlier lamps in Type 16 B have low bodies and narrow rims; these may be safely limited to the first quarter of the 6th century. The later examples within this type tend to have somewhat higher bodies and slightly wider rims; these may have been gradually introduced in the very last years of the 6th century, but were no longer made after the Persian invasion. There is no sharp line of demarcation between the earlier and later examples. Some lamps fall in between, and it is only the extremes in the width of the rim that may assuredly be placed early or late within this very popular type. 94 (L 4190). Pls. 4, 32.

Two lamps are of non-Attic clay; all the rest are Athenian products. 118 is Corinthian, an interesting Corinthian imitation of the Attic Type 16 B, which had been inspired in turn by the earlier Corinthian Type 16 A. 106 is of a coarse red micaceous clay that resembles the Corinthian fabric used so often in later years in Type 16 A. 106 (L 2181).

TYPE 17 A LAMPS WITH GLAZED RIDGES AROUND BORDERS OF RIMS Nos. 120-123 (and 2 others inventoried). Plates 4, 33. Corinth: classified under Type II. Latest years of 6th century and down to ca. 480 B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 16 B and on the finding places. A very sophisticated type of lamp, not unrelated to Type 16 B, shows the craft of the lamp- maker at its highest peak, with exceptional skill evident in the handling of profiles and contrasts of color. A flat or slightly concave bottom supports the walls that rise in two planes, an upper and a lower; the former is always concave, the latter usually so. The flat top is banded by a raised ridge around the central opening and another, around the outer edge, which overhangs or pro- longs the concave profile of the upper part of the walls. This overhang, together with the flat top, shows a close relationship to lamps of Type 16 B. The nozzle is also similar to the conventional nozzle of that type. It is possible that a horizontal band handle was occasionally used, but the</page><page sequence="42">36 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS complete rear portion of no lamp is preserved where traces of a handle might be found. One example, 123, has a central tube and two nozzles recalling 110 of Type 16 Variants. Smooth Attic clay is used consistently in these lamps, and a very good quality of black glaze that is applied to the floor of the interior, on the lower section of the exterior wall, around the exterior of the nozzle, and on the two ridges that encircle the rim. Elsewhere the clay is left exposed, although an occasional use is made of a thin diluted glaze-wash on the bottom and on the upper part of the walls; none ever appears on the rim. The consistency shown in these lamps suggests that they were made in one shop, possibly during a very short period of years. 120 (L 3968). Pls. 4, 33. H. 0.024 m.; Est. D. 0.083 m.

TYPE 17 B LAMPS WITH DOTTED RIDGES AROUND RIM'S BORDERS Nos. 124-125 (and 1 other inventoried). Plates 4, 33. Ca. second quarter of 6th century B.C. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 6 A and 12 A, and on the finding place of 125. This sturdy type is made of a much thicker Attic fabric and has a somewhat different profile than Type 17 A. Few exist, and these fragmentary, but they form a distinctive class that was surely the product of one shop, perhaps of one craftsman. A very heavy raised base with a slightly concave bottom or high slanted base-ring supports the curving side walls; the rim profile with inner and outer concentric ridges is very similar to that of Type 17 A, but it also recalls the flat rims with ridges of Types 6 A and 12 A. No example preserves a trace of a handle. The nozzles on two of our examples are missing; they may have been closed or open, like that of 125. This open nozzle recalls the similar formation seen on Type 6 A. In the use of glaze these lamps are unusual, since black is confined to the interior and a series of dots on the two ridges; elsewhere the clay is unglazed, although there may be a diluted glaze- wash on the edges of the rim. The use of dots of glaze on the rim recalls the dots or dashes of glaze applied to a slightly later lamp of Type 7 (53). Type 17 B belongs earlier in the over-all classification than its position here indicates. The superficial resemblance of its ridged rim to that of Type 17 A is the reason for its position here.</page><page sequence="43">TYPE 18 37 124. (L 1361). Pls. 4, 33. H. 0.038 m.; Max. dim. 0.071 m.

TYPE 18 DOUBLE-DECKER LAMPS Nos. 126-130 (and 5 others inventoried). Plates 5, 33. First two decades of 5th century B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 16 B, 17 A, and on the finding places. Double-decker lamps with very different profiles will continue to be made sporadically, as rare versions of later types, for a long time; see 356 and 357 of Type 25 Variants, which may be as late as the early years of 3rd century B.c. An uninventoried example exists in Delos with late Hellenistic features. The average Greek lamp with a single nozzle furnished a small light " suitable for most purposes in the average household. Sometimes more light was needed or desired, and a well equipped house might have not only a number of simple small lamps but occasionally a large lamp with two wick-holes; examples of these broad luxurious lamps appear in the early 5th century with the emergence of Types 16 and 17; 47 lamps such as 110 and 123 have rather wide central openings that would admit dust and dirt; their breadth and comparative shallowness might have made them precarious to carry when filled or lighted. To produce a more compact type of lamp that would eliminate these drawbacks and yet contain twice the normal amount of oil for the two nozzles, an inventive craftsman devised Type 18, stressing vertical expansion rather than horizontal. This new type shows a pair of lamps, one above the other. The lower lamp is a simple con- tainer; the single example preserved from the Agora shows a broad slightly concave bottom with side walls rising, nearly straight, to the point of junction with the upper lamp. Presumably this lower member had a tube leading into it. An unpublished lamp in the Acropolis Museum, No. 5617, gives evidence for a separate nozzle for the lower lamp, at the level of its top rather than the level of the upper lamp's top. Several of the Agora's specimens, preserving parts of the upper lamps, but little of the lower, show a tube or spout, projecting like a nozzle but not formed like one, at the level of the upper lamp's rim; such a spout is the filling hole for the lower reservoir; it leads directly into it through a small hole in the side wall of the lower lamp. This hole is too small and too inconvenient to have served for the easy insertion of a wick. The upper and lower bodies were made separately, then joined while the clay was in a leather- hard state; the upper lamp was placed firmly in the top of the open lower member, then the two united by added clay at the point of juncture, the whole exterior smoothed down while the double lamp was put on the wheel again. The top of the upper lamp is not unusual; in some instances it is like the top of Type 16 B 4 About the same intensity as a modern candle; the average lamp of Type 16 B holds enough oil to burn approximately four hours. , The presumption that these were for domestic rather than sanctuary use is based on the fact that masses of household pottery were found with them in wells. None has been found in debris definitely assignable to a sanctuary, but of course the market area had few sanctuaries in the early 5th century.</page><page sequence="44">38 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS lamps, with a nearly flat overhanging rim. Other examples have tops like those of Type 17 A, with raised bands around outer and inner edges of the flat rims. The upper lamp always has a con- ventional nozzle, usually like the nozzles of Types 16 and 17. An entire lamp would presumably have three projecting members: a nozzle for each of the reservoirs and a tube for filling the lower one. No lamp is sufficiently preserved to show the relative positions of these projections, although there is evidence in 130 to show that the nozzle of the upper lamp was opposite the filling tube for the lower. The Acropolis lamp shows that its two nozzles were opposite each other. Although the presence of a real nozzle for the lower lamp on the Acropolis example seems to show that the lower body served actually to hold oil and a wick, it must be noted that there are no lower nozzles preserved on the fragmentary Agora examples. Nor do the later double- bodied lamps (356 and 357 of Type 95 Variants) preserve any indication of nozzles for the lower portions. Another factor to consider is the absence of glaze within any of the lower interiors, yet these interiors are remarkably clean, bearing no traces of accumulated grime or burning. It seems quite plausible that, although some double-decker lamps may have been used as two separate oil reservoirs, many of them, perhaps most, were constructed so that the lower chamber would contain something else. Hot water is the most obvious suggestion, introduced to warm the lamp and the oil in the upper reservoir, to make the oil burn better if it were turgid or semi-congealed on a cold night. This would explain the cleanliness of the interiors and the presence of a number of filling-spouts but so few nozzles for the lower chambers. The water would remain in the lamp for the duration of the evening, and then be poured out the next day. If any oil remained in the lamp from the previous night it would not spill out when the water reservoir was emptied, because the tube for the lower chamber is on the back of the lamp, opposite the nozzle of the upper reservoir. The use of glaze on lamps of Type 18, which are made of Attic clay, is similar to the arrange- ments on the several preceding types. Good black glaze is used on the interior of the upper lamp. There is no glaze in the lower chamber; it would have been impossible to introduce a brush after the upper lamp was attached, and the makers evidently preferred not to pour in glaze through a nozzle or tube and then empty it out after the inside was coated, as later lamp manufacturers frequently did. On the outside, glaze is usually used on and around the nozzles and filling tubes and for bands around the outside and inside of the rim; 130 has no glaze whatsoever on its exterior. Diluted glaze-wash appears often on the bottoms and on the exterior walls; it may or may not be used on the reserved red clay areas of the rims between the bands of glaze. As on lamps of Type 16 B, this wash was applied before the black glaze was added. The type is predominantly an Athenian one. Three were found in the excavations at the Kerameikos.'" One found at Selinus seems to be Attic, but later than the floruit of Type 18.'9 An example from Cyprus is Attic, but of a later period; this lamp was a chandelier with three superimposed reservoirs, all with nozzles."50 126 (L 4062).

TYPE 19 A LAMPS WITH SHARP ANGLE BETWEEN BODY AND RIM; CENTRAL TUBES; IMPORTED FABRIC Nos. 131-135 (and 13 others inventoried). Plates 5, 33. Corinth: classified under Type III. Last quarter of 6th century B.C. to ca. 480. Dating based partly on the fact that such lamps found at Lindos 51 are assigned to the period after 525 B.c. and partly on the finding places. Broad shallow lamps with two nozzles flourished concurrently with the more compact double- bodied lamps, and even though they may have been impractical, continued with a greater popu- larity, since they were cheaper and easier to construct. One large group, Type 19 A, consists of shallow saucer-like specimens, each of which has a slightly convex bottom that curves up into low side walls; the rim is flat and slopes downward, overhanging the interior only. There is a wide central tube with a conical profile and a neatly defined angle at the point of junction with the bottom, as in lamps of Type 11; it seems probable that this central fixture is to facilitate holding the lamp while lighted, and is a development of the open corona type of lamp. No signs of wear appear within the tube wherever it is preserved. The two nozzles, diametrically opposite, are unusual in that they tip upward, continuing the slanting line of the rim so that their tips are several millimeters higher than the rim. The wick- holes intrude well into the rim. The nozzles are shallow, obviously handmade, and bear the marks 51 Blinkenberg, Lindos, I, p. 615, pl. 122, no. 2557.</page><page sequence="46">40 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS of finger prints on the outside where they were patted onto the lamp itself. There is no handle in Type 19 A. The clay is thin and brittle, probably not Attic; it is light brown to buff in color, sometimes with small air bubbles and occasionally micaceous. The undersides of most of these lamps are ridged, where they have been trimmed down with a wooden tool. A dull black glaze, sometimes fired red, appears on the interiors and the rims, never on the exteriors or interiors of the nozzles, save for a trace sometimes where the glaze of the rims is brought out onto part of the nozzle's rims. These lamps have appeared in other areas where they have been called variously South Russian,52 Rhodian, and Attic."' The clay resembles that used for household pottery in the Lindos settlements, according to Blinkenberg; "5 it is a thin brittle clay rather unlike the normal Attic product. The omission of glaze around the outside of the nozzle is not typical of Attic lamps of this period or any related period, and the tipped angle of the nozzle is at variance with Athenian traditions of lamp-making.

There is also a close relationship with Type 16 B, which has a similar lower profile and rim, although its rim extends over both the outer and inner faces of the walls, rather than just over the inner area as in Types 19 A and B. The central tube is wide and very low; sometimes missing is the sharp profiling at the junction of tube and bottom which is char- acteristic of Type 19 A. The outside of the body frequently bears horizontal ribbing made by a tool while the lamp was leather-hard. The usual lamp has a pair of nozzles, like the prototype, but an occasional example bears only one. The nozzles intrude slightly onto the rim's surface; the tips of the nozzles frequently, but not always, copy the upward swing of Type 19 A. No lamp has a handle. In the use of glaze as well as clay these lamps reflect the contemporary Athenian mode of Type 16 B; good black glaze is used throughout the interior, on the rim, and all around the exteriors of the nozzles. Elsewhere the exterior shows the conventional Attic diluted glaze-wash. The Athenians did not approve of the impractical custom, seen on Type 19 A, of leaving the outside of the nozzle uncoated, where dripping or burning oil might leave an unsightly stain on the unglazed clay. It is interesting to note that only seven of these Athenian lamps exist in the Agora inventory, compared to eighteen examples of the imported Type 19 A. Both types are contemporary, and show that the local fabricants were not entirely successful in competing with a cheaper foreign product. After the Persian invasion Type 19 A ceased to be imported and the local craftsmen turned to other styles, both for home consumption and export. 136 (L 3554). Pls. 5, 33. H. 0.017 m.; D. 0.097 m.

Plates 5, 33. Corinth: classified under Type III. Last quarter of 6th century B.C. to ca. 480. Dating based on the rim formations, like those of Types 19 A and B, and on the finding places. A number of lamps may be assigned to Type 19 Variants because their rims are like those of lamps in the two preceding classifications, and it is generally according to the development of the rim and top that distinctions between types are made. This characteristic rim is flat or nearly flat and overhangs the interior of the lamp horizontally or sloping inwardly; there is no overhang on the exterior. In other respects these variant lamps differ from Types 19 A and B. Most of them have handles, raised bases, and solid floors without the central tube; usually they carry single nozzles and a complete covering of black glaze. Chronologically, however, the variants are close to the standard varieties of Type 19. All of the variants are made of Attic clay (with one possible exception, 148, which may be an import). The idiosyncrasies in profile and decoration are dis- cussed below in the descriptions of the individual lamps, together with occasional stylistic con- nections that these variants may have with other types in addition to Types 19 A or B. 142 (L 3961).

A lamp having both handle and cen- tral tube is unusual; in this case the tube is re- dundant, obviously not designed for affording an easy grasp and useless for this purpose because of the handle. Perhaps the nozzle and handle were made to counterweight each other, in order to allow the tube to be used as a means of suspend- ing the lamp upon occasion. Ibid., no. 348, pls. LXVIII, LXIX.

Mended from many pieces; most of nozzle and very narrow horizontal bar handle missing; re- stored. Good black glaze throughout including all of bottom and area between points of attachment of handle. The use of good black glaze all over is unusual, but not necessarily an indication of late- ness. The convexity of the walls and the down- ward curve of the rim, however, combined with the lack of very sharp definition between walls and rim suggest a relationship with Type 90, which is a later type. 147 certainly belongs in the 480's rather than earlier. 148 (L 4000). Pls. 5, 33. H. 0.02 m.; D. 0.075 m. Five joining fragments preserve about half of rim and walls with part of floor, none of nozzle; there was no handle. Thin pink clay, perhaps Attic, but not unlike the clay of Type 19 A; brownish black glaze on rim and for a large dot and circle at center of floor only. The profile of the lamp seems later than the early years of the 5th century, but such a re- stricted use of glaze is most unusual for a date as late as the second quarter of that century. It is quite possible that this odd specimen is of non- Attic origin and perhaps allied to Type 12 A, with a comparable date, in the second and third quar- ters of the 6th century. TYPE 20 EARLY LAMPS WITH CURVED SIDES; RIDGE AROUND FILLING-HOLE Nos. 149-155 (and 12 others inventoried). Plates 5, 34. Corinth: classified under Type V. First half of 5th century B.c. (both before and after the Persian wars), into the 460's. A very common sort of lamp throughout the 5th century B.c. and well into the 4th is one with curving sides that extend inward to form the rim and enclose much of the body of the lamp. There are several variations on this theme, all of them beginning in the early years of the 5th century. One of these, that does not last after 450 B.C., is Type 20, a distinctive group of lamps. This type marks a further step in the growing tendency to enclose more and more of the body of the lamp so that the rim becomes more like a top with a small central filling hole. Type 20 has a flat or slightly concave bottom, or sometimes a slightly raised base, that curves up into low sides extending inwardly and meeting a kind of rim. The rim is simply a raised band or a raised ring around the filling hole, but it is a relative of the narrow flat rim seen on lamps of earlier types, particularly Types 6 A, 12 A, and 13. All examples have single nozzles with wick-holes that encroach a little onto the upper parts of the bodies, in a manner reminiscent of the wick-holes of Type 19 A. About half of the lamps are without handles; the others have flat horizontal band handles opposite the nozzles. The clay is always Attic and the use of glaze is uniform; good black glaze is applied in a band around the shoulder of the lamp and on the raised ring or rim; with one exception (150) there is always a reserved area between these two concentric circles of glaze. The shoulder circle</page><page sequence="50">44 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS is broad if the raised rim is broad; it is correspondingly narrow if the rim is merely a raised ring, and in such cases the reserved area of natural clay is wider. Elsewhere glaze is used for the interiors, for the exteriors of the nozzles, the exteriors of the handles, and the areas of the lamps between the points of attachment for the handles. The lower parts of the bodies and bottoms uniformly carry a diluted glaze-wash, sometimes thin and inconspicuous, sometimes thick and reddish. 149 (L 1186). Pls. 5, 34. H. 0.019 m.; D. 0.085 m.

There is little change or development within this period, but the earlier examples have certain minor characteristics in common which group them together as members of Type 21 A. These lamps, although varying in some other respects, uniformly have flat or slightly concave bottoms without raised bases, that curve up into the distinctive rounded sides characteristic of Type 20; the rims continue the curve of the sides and enclose, in some lamps, large parts of the bodies. The curving rims continue from Type 5. All lamps in Type 21 A are possessed of a single nozzle with an oval wick-hole that touches the area of the rim and usually encroaches upon it. Usually there is a handle opposite the nozzle, horizontal and either flat or circular in section; occasionally there is no handle. There is considerable uniformity in clay and the use of glaze; the former is Attic. The black glaze is of varying quality, but applied always to the interior, the exterior of the nozzle, and the handle if one exists; some lamps have glaze on the area between the points of attachment for the handle, some do not. With the exception of the earliest of these lamps, 156, the broad rim is also coated with glaze, and this sometimes extends down to cover the sides; the bottom is always unglazed and usually bears a thick coating of diluted glaze-wash. After the events of 480-479 B.C. the type changed somewhat (into Type 21 B) with the addition of a flat raised base. The majority of the lamps of Type 21 A were made in the first two decades of the 5th century, although the type began somewhat earlier as a development from Type 5. 156 (L 3444). Pls. 6, 34.

Plates 6, 34. Corinth: classified under Type IV. Between 480 B.c. and ca. 415 B.c. This long-lived variety of Type 21 has most of the usual characteristics associated with Type 21 A, with the addition of a well defined flat raised base; this base is the distinguishing feature of Type 21 B; it is very rarely found in the long series of Type 21 lamps before 480 B.C.56 The raised base may be either flat or very slightly concave; the floor inside the lamp is also flat or nearly so, with never any occurrence of the central raised cone or projection that frequently characterizes lamps made before 480 B.c. The sides curving into the rim are like those on lamps in Type 21 A. Every one of the inventoried lamps in the Agora collection, assigned to Type 21 B, has a trace or more of a horizontal band handle, whenever the rear portion of the lamp is preserved. The handles are usually flat in section, but that of 167 is by exception circular and has its points of attachment close together, giving to the handle a pronounced U-shape, comparable to U-shaped bar handles on contemporary skyphoi. This handle is horizontal, and is in the same plane as the top of the lamp; the usual handles of Type 21 B are set at a slight angle to the top and afford an easy grasp. The nozzles of Type 21 B are small and flat, with the wick-hole occupying practically all of the nozzle. There is a tendency for the nozzle to be somewhat broader and longer, and the wick- hole further removed from the rim of the lamp, in later examples of the type. This is not con- sistent, however, and cannot be reliably employed as a means of close dating within the type. It will be seen, however, that when the nozzle becomes pronouncedly elongated in the late 5th and early 4th centuries B.c. it serves as a distinguishing characteristic for identifying lamps of Type 21 C, a much later variety of this curved-rim class. All lamps of Type 21 B are of Attic clay and show great consistency in the use of black glaze. This is generally of good quality and applied all over the lamp, inside and outside, with the exception of the base. Only two lamps, 167 and 170, have glazed bottoms, and these examples also differ, as may be seen in the description below, in the matter of handle or nozzle. The normal unglazed base is usually coated with a pink diluted glaze-wash. The extensive use of glaze on the outside includes the area between the handle attachments, often left unglazed on lamps made 56One early lamp with a raised base, 184, is catalogued under Type 21 Variants.</page><page sequence="53">TYPE 21 B 47 before 480 B.c. but rarely unglazed afterward; 164 is the one exception with a reserved space between the handle attachments. Type 21 B was the commonest type of lamp during the second and third quarters of the 5th century. It was easy to make, convenient to use, and did not deviate from a standard form for two generations. It did not stop abruptly; the nozzles gradually became longer and wider. Examples with pronouncedly long and wide nozzles have been classified as Type 21 C, and belong to the last quarter of the 5th century B.C. and the early years of the 4th. 164 (L 4536). Pls. 6, 34.

Corinth: classified under Type IV. Last quarter of 5th century B.C. and well into early years of 4th century. Dating based partly on stylistic development from Type 21 B and partly on the finding places. Examples have been found on the Pnyx in a context dated before 404-403 B.C. (Hesperia, I, 1932, p. 133, fig. 20). In the last quarter of the 5th century some lamps with curved rims began to be made with much longer and flatter nozzles, broader than their predecessors, and with the wick-holes well removed from the rim area. These lamps, with nozzles characteristic of other late 5th and 4th century B.C. types, brought the main features of Type 21 well down into the 4th century. Occasion- ally Type 21 C lamps are found with multiple nozzles. In all other essential respects Types 21 B and C are similar: the raised base, the curved sides and rim, and the flat ribbon handle set at a slight angle to the top of the lamp are common to both. The clay and glaze are alike, although in Type 21 C the glaze is apt to be of poor quality and carelessly applied; often it has a tendency to flake. Glaze always appears between the points of attachment for handles; the bases usually but not always carry a coating of dilute glaze-wash similar to that seen on Type 21 B. Type 21 C gradually crept into the market some time in the last quarter of the 5th century. It must be reaffirmed that the type is not a new one, but rather a development, in the nozzle area only, from the preceding variety. It is difficult to draw the line between later Type 21 B's, with a tendency toward larger nozzles, and early Type 21 C's with nozzles less advanced than usual. By the middle of the first quarter of the 4th century Type 21 C was seldom seen, although a conservative older craftsman might continue to produce in subsequent years a few examples of this form that had been so exceedingly popular around the turn of the century. 171 (L 3160).

Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 21 C. This group comprises lamps exactly like those of Type 21 C except that the exteriors are unglazed."' They are handsome specimens with an effective contrast between the rich dark glaze of the interior and the pinkish buff Attic clay of the exteriors, left without glaze or wash but polished. Caprice or a desire to make a lamp more aesthetically pleasing led these later craftsmen into the unglazed versions; they were actually returning to the 6th century modes, with partial glazing, after a century or so had elapsed during which glaze was applied more and more, and finally to all parts of the lamp. The glazed interiors keep the lamps reasonably practical, pre- venting much oil from seeping through the porous clay. The two Agora specimens reflect the two varieties of handle seen in Types 21 A and B. One has the standard horizontal band handle, while the other's is narrower and circular in section, like that of 167 (Type 21 B) and 159 (Type 21 A). This latter version of the -handle becomes increas- ingly popular in the late 5th century. 177 (L 2830). Pls. 6, 34. H. 0.025 m.; D. 0.085 m. Complete except for most of loop handle.

Since the profiles, nozzles and other morphological elements are the same in both glazed and unglazed versions of the same type, the unglazed examples are not classed as separate types but are given the designation "Prime" following the type classification. In the text and catalogue this word will be found written out; in the deposit summaries and in the Concordance, pp. 221-245, the symbol ' is used.</page><page sequence="56">50 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS TYPE 21 D CURVED RIMS; RESTRICTED USE OF GLAZE Nos. 179-183 (and 3 others inventoried). Plates 6, 35. Corinth: classified under Type IV. Late in first quarter of 5th century B.C. into early years of fourth quarter. An apparently simple but actually complex group of lamps with curving sides shows an early 5th century tradition lasting into the fourth quarter of the century. All of the lamps in this group have common major characteristics; every one has a slightly concave bottom, with no trace of a raised base, curving up into the sides and overhanging rim that are seen in all subdivisions of Type 21. Every lamp that has its back portion preserved bears a trace or more of the normal horizontal band handle. Every lamp is of Attic clay and has a restricted use of black glaze in an early 5th century manner: in the interior, on the handle, around the outside of the nozzle, and in two concentric bands around the rim that leave a reserved circle between. The unglazed portions are uniformly covered with a thin diluted glaze-wash. Only in the nozzles is there a slight difference; two lamps have rather small nozzles with the wick-hole close to or intruding onto the shoulder. Others have proportionately larger and broader nozzles, like those of Type 21 B, with the wick-hole well removed from the shoulder area. If the development of the nozzle is a trustworthy criterion for the dates of lamps, one would say that the latter lamps are at least a generation later than the others. Yet their concave bottoms and restricted use of glaze might point to an earlier era in the first two or three decades of the 5th century. The circumstances of finding prove that the nozzle development is indeed reliable as a chronological index. The two earlier lamps, 179 and 180, both of which happen to have the bands of glaze around the rims applied in broader circles than on the later lamps, could have been made just after the Persian destruction of 480-479 B.C. Possibly a veteran lamp-maker decided to continue in his new work the modes of the preceding decades, and his shop continued along these lines for another generation or two. The Periclean period is not noted for archaizing tendencies nor old-fashioned survivals, rather the contrary; but here is the work of one person or group that challenged the progressive movements of the day and catered to tastes formed much earlier.58 179 (L 243).

First quarter of 5th century B.C. for most. Dating based on the finding places or the nozzle formations. A few lamps with the characteristic curved wall and rim of Types 21 A-D but with individual variations in profile, nozzle, clay or use of glaze are grouped together as variants, since they are close to no one of the foregoing subdivisions. They are for the most part comparatively early and reflect the diversity in form that occurred in the early years of the emergence of Types 21 A and B, before the standards were formed. 191, however, may be as late as the early 4th century, because of the similarity of its nozzles to those of Type 21 C. 184 (L 3413).

It seems more probable, however, that the saucer was to contain an offering of grain or seed while the lamp was burning in honor of Demeter or Kore; the saucer is like those of kernoi associated with the Eleusinian deities. Lighted lamps were combined with offerings to these personages, according to the Scholiast on Nikander, Alexi- pharmaka, 217 f. (reference quoted by H.

Plates 7, 35. Corinth: classified under Type IV. Ca. 500-460 B.C. Dating based on stylistic analogies with Type 21 A and on the finding places. Related to lamps of Types 21 A-C, both in general shape and in date, is a sizeable group of lamps that may be classed separately because of their distinctive features: central tubes and decorated rims. The earliest and the simplest have been grouped together as Type 22 A. They are remarkably uniform; every one has a simple concave bottom like that of Type 21 A, but rising in the center into an open tube that projects up through the floor of the lamp, its top or collar as high or higher than the rim of the lamp; every one has low rounded sides curving over into an overhanging rim, as in Types 21. Every lamp has a single nozzle, with the wick-hole occupying all of its area and intruding somewhat onto the shoulder of the lamp. These lamps were made without handles, but they could not have been suspended because the single nozzles would have rendered them unbalanced; as in earlier types, the central tube seems to be a development of the central cavity or opening designed for a finger-hold. It is possible that one of the larger lamps, 195, may have had two nozzles; its back portion is entirely missing and a second nozzle has been conjecturally</page><page sequence="59">TYPE 2. B 53 restored." In such a case the central tube could have been used for suspension, but this particular one, like all others, shows absolutely no signs of wear that might have been made either by a sus- pension arrangement or by impalement on a thin vertical support. There is still a survival here of the earlier finger-hole, although it will be seen that in the 4th century, central tubes with high collars, or central rods, definitely were used for suspending lamps. The clay reveals the Attic origin and manufacture of these lamps. Good black glaze is used sparingly; it occurs in the interiors, around the outsides of the nozzles, and in two broad con- centric bands around the rim with a reserved circle in between. Every lamp bears some trace of diluted glaze-wash on its base. 193 (L 4364). Pls. 7, 35. H. 0.024 m.; D. 0.088 m. Complete save for minor chips. Normal use of glaze and wash. 194 (L 4473).

Second quarter of 5th century to ca. 410 B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 21 B and on the finding places. This group of lamps differs little from the preceding, but every example of Type 22 B has a raised base, recalling that of Type 21 B, flat or concave, in place of the simpler bottom of Type 22 A. The central tube, the lack of handle, the curved sides and rim, appear the same in both Types 22 A and B. Normally this more developed type has a single nozzle, but one example at least, 199, had two, opposite each other. The normal nozzle is small, with a large wick-hole some- times intruding onto the shoulder of the lamp; late specimens are wider and longer with pro- portionately small wick-holes. The clay is Attic throughout. Good black glaze is used, but in a distinctive manner, differing from the method of application seen in Type 22 A. Besides appearing on the interior of the lamp, glaze is used on all of the exterior as well, except for the base and one or two neat reserved circles around the rim. The bases often preserve traces of diluted glaze-wash, sometimes with an added red pigment; a few lamps seem never to have been given a wash on their unglazed surfaces. Type U2 B was popular during the Periclean period, and one can see reflected in the careful profiles of these lamps and their neatly applied glaze some of the craftsmanship and artistry that characterized major works of that epoch. 59 Cf. 199 of Type 2a B, which certainly had two nozzles opposite each other, and 203 of Type ft C.</page><page sequence="60">54 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS 196 (L 4771).

Corinth: classified under Type V. Second and third quarters of 5th century B.c. Type 2s C is very much like Type R2 B and has approximately the same floruit. The major difference between the two types is the use in the former of decorative grooves or raised bands around the rim. Type 22 C has the raised base (flat on all preserved examples), the central tube, the curved side walls, the lack of handle, and the same nozzle formation seen on the companion type. Again Attic clay is used exclusively, and the good black glaze and thin diluted glaze-wash are used similarly in both types. The grooves or raised bands around the rim are usually left unglazed, although 204 has an added circle of glaze in this area. It is quite possible that the makers of Type 2s B also may have produced this slightly more elaborate design for some of their lamps. 201 (L 4227). Pls. 7, 35. H. 0.027 im.; D. 0.088 m.

This lamp came to light in the upper southeast area of the Agora, not far below the slopes of the Acropolis; it may well have been part of the furnishings in one of the citadel's sanctuaries refurbished after the Persian invasion.</page><page sequence="62">56 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS 208 (L 4136).

Late in third quarter of 5th century B.c. into first quarter of 4th century. Among the common types of the late 5th and early 4th centuries is a large group of lamps that have curved sides similar to those of Types 21 A-D, but with a clearly defined rim, sloping inward usually, and progressing from a narrow variety to a very wide one that encloses nearly the whole top. Within the type there is seen also a gradual development from low broad bodies to higher and narrower profiles. Type 23 A includes a number of lamps with common characteristics besides the curved body and the narrow rim already mentioned. All these lamps are rather broad and shallow; they have long wide nozzles, flat on top, with good-sized wick-holes at the ends; some large lamps have two nozzles, opposite each other, but without the central tube seen in double-nozzled lamps of Types 22 A-C. Every lamp with a single nozzle has a handle opposite it, normally a flat band handle but occasionally, among the earlier ones, a narrow tubular handle as 209. Every lamp has a raised base or a ring foot; the former is slightly concave, and the latter may be simple or combined with a central raised disk, as 212. All the lamps are of Attic clay and coated with a good black glaze. The glaze normally covers the entire lamp, both inside and out, except for the base; this is usually reserved and coated with a thin slip or wash as on 213. The bottom may, however, be partly glazed as 212, or by exception entirely glazed as 216. The uninterrupted use of black on the upper surfaces of the lamps is, by exception, relieved on one example, 218, with concentric reserved bands encircling the rim. There are minor variations within the type, but the profiles and nozzles show that all these lamps are essentially members of one group. These lamps of Type 23 A cover a generation.

Similar to Type 23 A in profile, but with certain idiosyncrasies of its own, is another group of lamps that was made for a rather short time, perhaps by one shop, in the later years of the 5th century. These lamps are made with a base-ring rather than the flat raised base usually seen on the preceding type; the walls and rim however are exactly like those of Type 23 A. Some examples have the broad horizontal band handle, but more frequently seen is the narrow U-shaped bar handle. The nozzles have the same shape and size as those occurring on other lamps of this period, whether they appear singly or are used opposite each other on large specimens. In the latter cases one finds the familiar central tube of Types 22, and as usual the tubes show no signs of internal wear. The lamps were locally made of Attic clay but in the use of glaze appears one of the noticeable differences between these and other contemporary lamps. In an old-fashioned manner there is a partial use of black glaze on the exteriors. The tops of the nozzles are always reserved and also the space between the handle attachments. The bottoms also show reserved areas; these are on the resting surfaces of the base-rings and occasionally in the centers or in bands around the bottoms of the walls. Elsewhere a fine black glaze appears on the exterior and always throughout the interior.</page><page sequence="65">TYPE 23 C 59 223 (L 2862). Pls. 8, 36. H. 0.036 m.; D. 0.121 m.

TYPE 23 C FLAT RIMS; TALL CLOSED BODIES Nos. 228-233 (and 29 others inventoried). Plates 8, 36. Corinth: classified under Type VI. First and especially second quarters of 4th century B.c. Dating based in part on the fact that none are found in 5th century contexts of the Agora, and on the fact that many were exported to Olynthos and have been found lying in the debris of houses burned in 348 B.C., in part on the stylistic development from Type 23 A, and in part on the finding places in the Agora. Lamps of this group are actually a continuation and development of lamps of Type 23 A. Gradually, during the last years of the 5th century and the early years of the 4th, the bodies became higher in proportion to their diameters and more of the interiors were enclosed by broader rims. Nozzles became longer and narrower, and the wick-holes on this newer type are small and at the extreme ends of the nozzles. All of the lamps of Type 23 C have the simple raised base, flat or slightly concave, that was seen on the parent type. All have the horizontal band handle also. The Agora collection has no examples without handles nor any multiple-nozzled lamps in this group; the type is remarkably consistent, although it is easy to detect a difference between specimens of the early 4th century and those made a generation later; the latter are taller and have wider rims that enclose so much of the interiors that only small filling-holes are left in the centers. The Attic clay is uniformly covered with fairly good black glaze nearly all over; the bottoms alone are unglazed, and here is found sometimes a thin slip. Type 23 C emerged in its distinctive form sometime during the first quarter of the 4th century; for a few years previously it had been growing out of Type 23 A. All standard examples</page><page sequence="66">60 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS of Type 23 C date certainly after the civil disturbances in Athens of 404-403 B.c.; there is no certainty of their existence after the middle years of the 4th century.

Corinth: classified under Type VI. First half of 4th century B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 23 C. Perhaps an occasional example may have been produced later in the century. An occasional lamp comes to light with many of the features of Type 23 C, but without any glaze on the exterior. These sporadic examples differ from one another in minor ways, and do not seem to be the product of a single shop or of a short period. The bottom may be concave or, as 234, bear a raised disc on its concave surface. The curving walls are comparatively tall and the rims enclose much of the body. The nozzles also are like those of Type 23 C. The lamps were made without handles, however, and the Attic clay is rather thinner than in the preceding group; the interior glaze, when it exists, is of a very poor quality. These factors would indicate that the lamps are variants, rather than unglazed counterparts of the lamps in Type 23 C; the very close relationship existing between Types 23 A and 23 A Prime is not paralleled here. 235 might appear by its short nozzle to be very early, but actually it is one of the latest examples of Type 23 C Prime. The clay of the floor of the lamp is left as it came from the wheel, in a little spiral swirl; such swirls of clay are usually seen only on later lamps of the Hellenistic period.</page><page sequence="67">TYPE 23 D 61 234 (L 877).

Corinth: classified under Type VI. Third quarter of 4th century B.c., down into latest years of the century. Dating based partly on the fact that none of these lamps is found at Olynthos (destroyed 348 B.c.) and partly on the finding places in the Athenian Agora. The ultimate development in lamps with tall sides is reached in Type 23 D, which has easily recognized characteristics. This group emerges from Type 23 C in a transitional lamp, 236, with slightly curved high sides and a plain rim sloping slightly inward. But soon the new type is crystallized, and the high sides become practically straight, the rim or top becomes flat, and two shallow concentric grooves are added around the perimeter of the rim. In all of these lamps the nozzle is enormous, long and broad, flat on top, and level with the rim; the wick-hole is a large oval at the end of the nozzle. None of the lamps in this type has a handle. None has a proper base; the bottoms are usually flat or slightly concave. There is some- times a circular groove around the center of the base, occasionally a thin raised central disc on it, and on one example, 237, a slight indentation that is remininscent of the simple raised base of Type 23 C. The bottom of the lamps is thick and rises in every example into a central cone in the interior. These lamps are made of Attic clay and coated throughout the interior and most of the exterior with a thin black glaze that is inclined to flake. A few have glazed bases, but usually the bottom is uncoated save for occasional traces of a thin slip. The sturdy fabric of the lamps and the fact that the aperture on top is reduced to a small filling hole give them somewhat the look of 18th century inkwells. They were never used for this purpose," of course, but the resemblance makes a handy appellation for this convenient and popular type that had a full generation's approbation. 236 (L 2243).

Plates 8, 37. Late 5th into early 4th centuries B.c. Dating based on some stylistic similarities to Type 23 A and on the finding place of 242. Three very incomplete lamps in the Agora, forming a separate subdivision, have the curving sides and nearly flat rim of Type 23 A, but their nozzles are distinctive. In each case the body projects at one place into an angular proturberance, broad and heavy, and this serves as a nozzle. The wick-hole is exceptionally small, at the apex of the triangular excrescence, and is connected with the interior of the lamp by a hole of small bore pierced through the thick solid clay of the nozzle. The insertion of a wick must have been difficult, and this impracticality may be the reason for their rarity. Besides these three inventoried examples, only one other is known, an unpublished nozzle fragment from the Kerameikos excavations. The bottoms are not preserved, but they presumably were similar to those of other examples in Type 23 A. The lamps are made of good Attic clay, and have fine black glaze inside and out. The extant profiles suggest a similarity to Type 23 A rather than to groups later in the 4th century. The reason for the very small wick-hole remains a mystery; perhaps a very thin string-like wick, which could be fairly easily inserted, was occasionally used in some households to give a feeble or slow-burning vigil light for all-night use. These lamps might also have been valued for a certain practicality, since the nozzle is really an integral part of the lamp and would presumably be less liable to fractures. Yet the only examples known are portions with nozzles that have become separated from their bodies! 241 (L 470). Pls. 8, 37. H. 0.023 m.; Max. dim. 0.054 m. Nozzle with portion of rim preserved.

Corinth: classified under Type V. Late in third quarter of 5th century B.c. and well through the last quarter of the century. Dating based partly on stylistic development from Type 22 C and on similarities to Type 23 A, and partly on the finding places. Type 24 A is found on the Pnyx in contexts antedating 404 B.c. (Hesperia, I, 1932, pp. 133 ff., no. 2, fig. 20). It occurs in Corinth in a well with contents dated 460-420 B.c. (Hesperia, VI, 1937, pp. 257-316, CL 2337). An interesting group of wheelmade lamps, with both practical and decorative features, emerges in the second half of the 5th century. These lamps are contemporaries, by and large, of Type 23 A, and have the same low curved walls and wide shallow bodies; they continue the decorative rim treatment seen in Type 92 C. There is sometimes a raised base, flat or slightly concave, but more commonly the bottom has a base-ring. The curving side walls are topped by an inward sloping rim ornamented with one or more decorative grooves or raised bands. The usual handle is the narrow U-shaped bar variety, although the horizontal band handle is frequent. It is the normal but not constant practice to employ the narrow handle on lamps with base-rings (244 is one of the few exceptions, having a narrow handle and plain raised base). The narrow handle is placed at a slight angle to the body, well designed for hanging the lamp on a peg when not in use. When suspended on a peg the reverse of the lamp would have been turned toward the room, and the base-ring with concentric bands of glaze within it shows an interest in decorating this portion of the lamp, unseen when in use. No lamps with the wide band handles have base-rings and decorated bases, although they too may have hung on pegs when unused or on display in shops. The nozzles are long and flat with rather small wick-holes at the ends. Occasionally a nozzle will have a groove around the wick-hole extending back to two holes punched through to the interior, on either side of the base of the nozzle. This practical feature (seen on 246) allows oil to drain back into the interior if it seeps out of the wick-hole or drips from a soggy wick. The clay is Attic; the black glaze is of a fine quality and used throughout the interior and most of the exterior. The raised bases are entirely reserved, but within the base-rings on other specimens decorative bands and circles of glaze are almost invariably used (248 is the sole exception, with glaze on and solidly within the base-ring). 243 (L 3804).

TYPE 24 B RIMS DEPRESSED FOR COVERS; BROAD OPEN BODIES Nos. 254-256. Plates 9, 37. Approximately last quarter of 5th century B.c. Dating based on stylistic analogies with Type 24 A. Related to Type 24 A is a small group of lamps with slightly curving sides and deeply depressed rims. The grooves marking the transition between body and rim on Type 24 A are replaced here by a high ridge, actually the top of the side walls, that serves as an edge for the sunken rim. Such a device is admirably suited for the reception of a cover, for use when the lamp is not hung on the wall.62 Only one of the examples assigned to Type 24 B preserves its base; 256 shows a flat bottom, but it has side walls more slanting than the walls of others of Types 24 A and B. The usual base was presumably more in accord with that of Type 24 A. The handle, as it appears on 255, is of the narrow U-shaped variety seen often on Type 24 A. The nozzle as seen in 254 is long, flat on top, and level with the ridge around the top of the lamp. The lamps are made of fine Attic clay and covered uniformly with excellent black glaze throughout the interior and exterior. The bottoms, if they were equipped with base-rings, may have had concentric reserved bands as on Type 24 A. 256, with a rim rather differently designed from those of the others, has glaze omitted from its bottom and from the groove around the top. It is exceptional in several ways, and might almost be classed as a variant, although there is no reason to assign it to a different epoch. 254 (L 366). Pls. 9, 37. Pres.

Plates 9, 37. Corinth: classified under Type VII. Late years of 5th century B.C. through first quarter of 4th century. Dating based on stylistic similarities to the more numerous examples of the succeeding Type 24 C Prime, and on the finding place of 257. A small group of lamps transitional between Type 24 A and Type 25 A combines some elements of both. In a typical lamp of Type 24 C the curving sides are topped by shallow con- centric grooves and ridges at the junction of the sides and rim, reminiscent of Type 24 A. The bases are very small; the curved bottom of the walls is supported by a narrow base-ring or a narrow thick raised base, as in Type 25 A. All of these examples have broad horizontal band handles and long narrow flat-topped nozzles; such handles occur in both Type 24 A and Type 25 A, while the nozzles are like the usual examples seen in Type 25 A. These lamps are made of fine Attic clay and are glazed all over, except sometimes on the small bases, with good black glaze. These transitional examples classified as Type 24 C commence at the turn of the 5th and 4th centuries, at the end of the parent type's period. It will be seen below that Type 25 A begins in the second quarter of the 4th century; the first quarter of the 4th century would be the floruit of Type 24 C. 257 (L 4440). Pls. 9, 37.

Late years of 5th century B.c. into second quarter of 4th century. These unglazed lamps form a somewhat larger class than the preceding. There is no appreci- able difference in the form. Each has a small raised base or thick base-ring; often the heavy bottom rises convexly within the interior of the lamp. There are always high curving sides with a shallow groove or grooves at the junction with the downward curving rim; there is always a long flat nozzle. Most lamps have a horizontal flat band handle, although this feature is omitted on some of the specimens. * February 1958.

Corinth: classified under Type VII. From middle of second quarter of 4th century B.C. down into first quarter of 3rd century. This type is found frequently in the later deposits at Olynthos "3 so it is evident that it was established and exported well before 348 B.c. Our dating of the type is based partly on the stylistic develop- ment from Type 24 C, partly on the stylistic similarity with Type 25 A Prime which flourished in the second half of the 4th and 3rd centuries, and partly on the Agora finding places. More lamps in the Agora collection belong to Types 25 A-D than to any of the others, yet there are few subdivisions into smaller groups because of the remarkable and continued uni- formity of this class. The examples cover approximately a hundred years, but the essential shape remains about the same, a development of features found in Types 24 A and C. 63 Olynthus, V, pp. 279-282, Group 8.</page><page sequence="74">68 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS Type 25 A is easily recognizable. There is always a raised base, never a base-ring; the base is slightly concave and usually plain, although occasionally, as in 270, there is a slightly raised central disc within the concavity. The bottom is very thick and rises in the interior into a markedly convex hump; there are rare exceptions, as in the early, transitional, 267; but generally the heaviness of the bottom is an important distinguishing feature of Type 25 A.6' The sides are high with a pronounced curve, separated from the rim by a deep groove. The rim encloses a comparatively small filling-hole. In the earlier lamps of Type 25 A the rim is down-sloping, even concave, as in 267. In the later lamps, of the later 4th century, the rim is more horizontal or even convex, as in 273. These later specimens are also generally smaller in all their dimensions as compared to the bulky lamps of the mid 4th century. The nozzles are long, narrow, and flat on top with a small wick-hole at the end. The later lamps in the type, perhaps after ca. 330 B.c., tend to have somewhat narrower nozzles that are slightly more pointed in effect. Lamps of Type 25 A may or may not have a thick horizontal strap handle. There is some chronological difference between those with and without handles. It is significant that more examples with handles are found in the earlier years of the type's floruit and more without handles in the later years. The handles are broken in all the numerous Agora examples; they are not really adequate to support the heavy bulk of the lamps caused by the enormous weight of the bases; it would seem that accidents occurred frequently, so that gradually the handles were omitted. Although handleless examples occur in the early years of the type, no example with a handle need be later than ca. 310 B.c. and may be considerably earlier. It will be seen that in Type 25 B the handle was replaced with a pierced lug at one side. The lamps are of Attic clay and have a fairly good black glaze inside and out, except for the bases. These are unglazed although an occasional late example, such as 272, shows traces of glaze running over onto the base from the sides. 274, a miniature, by exception has its bottom glazed. Many lamps have a decorative treatment on the groove around the filling-hole where the glaze is scraped away after firing, leaving the pink clay exposed, a pleasing contrast to the lustrous black glaze elsewhere. In a few lamps this groove may have been scraped after glazing but before firing, since the edges are so evenly executed; it is not always easy to discern which method was used. It does not seem likely that the groove was ever completely reserved. 267 (L 4212). Pls. 9, 23, 38. H. 0.035 m.; D. 0.064 m. Intact except for central part of handle; re- stored.

Plates 10, 23, 38. Corinth: classified under Type VII. From late in second quarter of 4th century B.C. down into second quarter of 3rd century. Dating based partly on the fact that a very few have been found in Olynthos and so must be before 348 B.C.,65 and largely on the Agora finding places. This unglazed variety is very similar to the preceding type but in general lasts a little longer and shows in the late examples a simplification in shape that is more marked than in the later glazed specimens. The dominant characteristics for most of the lamps include the globular body with heavy base rising to a convexity within, and the raised foot that is more or less concave on its under surface where it is sometimes adorned with a raised disc. Handles occur rarely, usually in earlier specimens within the type,"6 and are not serviceable for such bulky lamps. As in Type 25 A, none of these horizontal strap handles survives in its entirety. The rim designs show a variety of forms, involving concentric grooves and ridges. There is normally a definitive band around the filling-hole, slightly convex and downward-sloping. In early examples this band is narrow and appears with surrounding grooves and ridges. In late examples it is broad and often used alone, being set off from the rest of the lamp simply by one deep groove. The variations in this band furnish a reliable criterion for assigning an early or late date to lamps within the type. Later lamps also tend to have side walls less spherical; they are smaller in all their dimensions throughout, and have proportionally less weight in their bases. Nozzles are like those of Type 95 A, and occasionally show traces of paring while leather-hard, as on 288. The clay is consistently Attic, of a particularly fine quality in the earlier lamps. Glaze is used on the interiors only, with the exception of an occasional specimen such as 285, where con- centric bands of glaze are used to decorate alternate grooves and ridges around the filling-hole. By chance a bit of glaze has sometimes run out of a nozzle, as on 298. Most lamps are covered on the exterior with a thin slip and very carefully finished. 285 (L 618). Pls. 10, 38.

Plates 10, 23, f8. Corinth: classified under Type VII. Second half of 4th century B.C. into first quarter of 3rd century. Dating based partly on the fact that none is found at Olynthos (destroyed 348 B.C.), and largely on the Agora finding places. This group of lamps is like Type 25 A in most ways except for the presence of a pierced lug on the left side. None of these lamps has a handle; the lug takes its place. This small, securely attached, protuberance is far less likely to break off than the average thin horizontal band handle that was so poorly designed for the heavy bulk of Type 25 A. A cord passed through the lug would have served to hang the lamp on a peg, both when on sale in a shop and during periods of inactivity in domestic use. The position of the lug is carefully managed so that the pierced hole comes a little forward of a line drawn across the full width of the lamp and at right angles to the nozzle. This results in an equilibrium when the lamp is suspended; the nozzle is more or less horizontal and does not hang down at an angle, as it would were the hole opposite the center of the lamp's body. Thus any remaining drops of oil in the suspended lamp would not drain out. The lug is also carefully placed on the side of the lamp's body, so that the lamp may hang in nearly the same plane as the wall or post on which it is hung. Were the lug nearer the filling-hole, the heavy base would tip the lamp. The lugs on Type 95 B are uniformly on the left side of the lamps, so that a group hung together (in a shop) would have their nozzles pointing in the same direction. All of these considerations seem to indicate that the lug was originally designed for the purpose of suspension,67 rather than primarily for the insertion of a thin stick of bronze, bone or wood that could conveniently lodge there when not being used to poke up the wick. The holes are large enough for the easy insertion of a cord, but not suitable for a bone probe or a stick of wood unless it were toothpick size. It seems improbable that every modest lamp would be equipped with a comparatively expensive bronze probe. No doubt, however, the holes in the lugs soon proved convenient for the occasional insertion of a stick of some sort, as 312 shows. This example was originally mounted on a columnar standard, as its bottom indicates, and its pierced lug seems unnecessary for suspension. Another example, 313, has a pierced lug on each side, one with a vertical hole and one with a nearly horizontal penetration. Perhaps symmetry was in the manu- facturer's mind, rather than functionalism, although one hole may have been used for suspension, the other one for a probe. In later years and in several succeeding types the lug will remain as a vestigial survivor without usefulness, unpierced, and placed on lamps that are equipped with usable handles. These later lamps have light bodies, thin walls, and no heavy mass of clay in the base, the weight of which caused the initial appearance of this protuberance to replace the thin handle. The profiles of these lamps exhibit considerable uniformity, with only minor exceptions. The bases are always concave, but some have added discs in their centers and 310 has a base that is closer to a ring foot. The curving sides are separated from the narrow rims by a well defined groove; occasionally there is a pair of grooves. A few lamps, not necessarily late within the type, 67 For discussions of the use of the pierced lug see Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 199, 201.

VII, p. 43.</page><page sequence="79">TYPE 25 B 73 show sides nearly vertical and considerable emphasis on the breadth and flatness of the rim, as 308 and 309. The latter has a barely perceptible groove, and in general shows a close stylistic connection with lamps of Type 23 D, with which it is contemporary. The lamps that are com- paratively early within the type have their greatest diameter low on the body. Later lamps tend to be more spherical in profile. As in Types 25 A and 25 A Prime, the rims may be either slightly concave or, more usually, somewhat convex. The former are earlier. The latest lamps tend to be somewhat smaller in general, with broad convex rims such as that on 311. The nozzles are long, narrow, and flat on top; that of 301, an early lamp, is by exception broad and reminiscent of the nozzles on lamps of Types 23 B and D. Type 25 B is uniformly of Athenian clay and covered with black glaze, inside and out, except for the bases. Occasionally, as on 303, the base is also glazed. As in Type 25 A, the quality of the black glaze deteriorates in the later lamps, serving as another criterion for early or late dating within the type, along with the change in the width of the rim and the decrease in the lamp's size. The base often shows traces of a thin slip; the groove around the filling-hole is usually scraped clear of glaze; occasionally it seems to have added red (miltos) applied to it. 301 (L 2242).

Third quarter of 4th century B.c. into second quarter of 3rd century. Dating based partly on the fact that this type is not found at Olynthos (destroyed 348 B.c.) but is found in fillings dated before 325 B.c. on the Pnyx in Athens,"B and also on the Agora finding places. This is by far the largest group of lamps of the Greek period from the Agora excavations. Type 95 B Prime not only had a very long life, of nearly a century, but was extremely popular during most of that period as a handy, easily produced product. The basic shape is the same as that of the three preceding types, with a raised base or base-ring supporting a rounded body and with a heavy interior mass. The base more likely than not has a slightly raised disc in its center, on the exterior. There are certain distinctions between the early and late members of this type, between those produced for the most part in the 4th century and those made in the first half of the 3rd. Those produced around the turn of the two centuries vary, however, so that there is no clear demar- cation, and no sure way of dividing the group. In general it is possible to say that the heavy bases are markedly massive in the early lamps, those certainly produced in the third and early fourth quarters of the 4th century. Here also the concentric grooves and ridges are pronounced and numerous, and the circular rim around the s8 Fillings of the Third Period of the Assembly Place, Hesperia, Suppl.

These lamps tend to be large, tall and made of a thick fabric. They frequently have a decorative use of glaze on the ridges around the filling-hole, contrasting pleasantly with the otherwise plain buff exteriors. This glaze is some- times applied individually to the separate concentric ridges, sometimes applied to the whole area and then scraped away from the intervening concentric grooves. These early lamps also tend to have a finer, creamier slip than the late ones. Lamps of the late first and second quarters of the 3rd century tend to be small, low, and broad rather than tall. The bases are lighter; there are few grooves or ridges around the filling- hole, but instead there is usually a pronounced raised ring, narrow or broad, that takes the place of the early depressed concave rim. This raised ring is normally convex in section. The late lamps have a fairly thin fabric, sometimes rather coarse, and seldom have the fine lustrous smooth slip of the early ones. On all lamps of Type 25 B Prime the nozzles are long, flat on top, with small wick-holes that sometimes seem too tiny for easy and effective use. There is never a handle, but uniformly a pierced lug on the left side, added after the lamp was completed. 320 has an extra pierced lug, at the back, almost like a miniature handle rather than a lug. 340, which is a fragment of a lug only, has two projections side by side, only one of which is pierced. Two lamps have lugs only partially pierced, with holes that do not go all the way through; these are late within the type and herald the advent of the solid lugs that will be common in some Hellenistic lamps, chiefly moulded types. The solid lugs will remain for a long while as vestigial and decorative survivals down into the early years of the 1st century after Christ. The lamps are local productions, of course. Not only is the clay typical of the fine Attic pinkish buff, but two workshop pieces survive. 334 is a waster; two lamps with part of a third are stuck together and warped due to some accident of firing; these are late (3rd century) examples and show traces of glaze on their interiors, demonstrating conclusively that a single firing served both to bake the clay and harden the glaze. 339 emerged from the kiln successfully, with the lug and nozzle properly added to the wheelmade body, but a careless workman had forgotten to punch the hole through the wall to communicate with the nozzle, a step that necessarily should have been done before firing. The lug and nozzle are now broken off, perhaps in the workman's unsuc- cessful attempt to bore a hole through the solid baked clay. This lamp also had failed to receive its inner coating of black or brown glaze, which is present in all other examples. The exteriors are unglazed, except for the concentric ridges on some of the early lamps mentioned above. A few specimens have dots of black glaze on their nozzles or lugs, producing an attempt at decoration. The smooth thin slip added to the outside of some earlier lamps is less frequently seen on the later ones. 318 (L 4021). Pls. 11, 39. H. 0.064 m.; D. 0.089 m. Complete.

TYPE 25 C PRIME (There is no Type 25 C with glazed exteriors) HEAVY BASES AND DOMED TOPS; UNGLAZED Nos. 341-349 (and 7 others inventoried). Plates 12, 39. Third quarter of 4th century B.c. down into first quarter of 3rd century. Dating based on examples from the Pnyx in a filling dated before ca. 325 B.C.,68 and on the finding places in the Agora. This type is a close relation of Type 25 B Prime in both appearance and date, but has enough idiosyncrasies to warrant classification as a distinct type. No examples have come to light that show a use of glaze on the exterior, although it is conceivable that there may have been occasional glazed counterparts, which could be classed as Type 25 C. The base is thick, as on the preceding types; it is raised and slightly concave beneath, some- times with the thin raised disc seen before. The side walls are slightly curved, but not so curving or bulbous as on the predecessors. There is a notable separation between the walls and the thick domed top, usually marked by a thin groove. The domed top covers most of the lamp, less so on 343, and forms the type's distinguishing characteristic. The filling-hole, usually small, is sur- rounded sometimes by grooves and ridges as on the preceding types, sometimes by a narrow concave or depressed rim. In general the silhouette of the lamp tends to be more rectangular and boxy than the spherical profiles seen previously, and forms a transition to the straight-sided, flat- topped lamps of Type 25 D Prime. There is never a handle, always a pierced lug on the left side. These lamps were no longer 69 Hesperia, Suppl.

The nozzles are exactly like those of the preceding type, long and flat with small wick-holes. The lamps are made of Attic clay. They are covered inside with a black or brown glaze; occasionally the glaze is used on the outside also, in a decorative series of concentric bands on the domed top or to coat the narrow rim around the filling-hole.

Plates 12, 39. Corinth: classified under Type VII. Late in third quarter of 4th century B.C. into first quarter of 3rd century. Dating based on the fact that one was found on the Pnyx in a filling before ca. 325 B.c.,"7 and on the findings places in the Agora. This variety is assigned to Type 25 because of the heavy bottom rising to a large cone-like mass in the interior, as in the preceding five groups. The base is always raised and either concave, or concave with a thin raised disc, or practically flat. The sides are nearly vertical with a slight outward bulge, and make a sharp angle at the junction of the broad top. Usually there are one or two thin grooves around the outer edge of the top to emphasize the distinction between the sides and the top, which may be either slightly convex or concave. The high dome of the previous type is replaced here by a more horizontal member. Another marked difference between Type 25 C Prime and this is the complete absence here of ridges, grooves, or little depressed rims around the filling-holes; in Type 25 D, moreover, the wall is much thinner in the top part of the lamp. Some of the filling-holes are so small, as on 350, that the potter would have had difficulty in closing the top of the lamp and leaving such a small hole for his finger. There are no handles, but in every case the familiar pierced lug is added on the left side. The nozzles too are the same as those seen on other members of the 25-family. 351 is unusual in that it has handmade ridges of clay added along the top of the nozzle to keep a cover in place. Its hand- made cover was found with the lamp in a grave. Although covers were sometimes used on lamps it is very rare to find a clay cover and its lamp together." Here the lid does not fit into a depression and would slip off were it not for the useful ridges along the nozzle. Both the filling-hole and the wick-hole are protected by the covering, presumably against dirt falling in but also against predatory mice." A boss on the under side that fits the filling-hole and a pierced knob for a cord on the top of the cover would serve to keep it firmly in place against unwanted marauders. Another lamp lid, 364, classed with Type 25 variants, is of approximately the same shape and date but is made with a mouse in relief on its top, showing the propensity of these animals to sip the oil when they had the opportunity.'" All the lamps of Type 25 D Prime are coated inside with black or reddish-brown glaze. None is glazed outside, not even with decorative bands or dots. It is conceivable that some may have existed with glazed exteriors, which would be classed as Type 25 D, but none is known at present. The finely worked Attic clay is sometimes left plain on the exteriors, sometimes treated with a slip, as on some of the preceding types. 71 Hesperia, Suppl. VII, p. 57, no. 83, fig. 24. 72 A 5th' century black-glazed lamp with its circular cover fitting neatly into a depression exists in the Kera- meikos Museum in Athens (no number). 7 In the Batrachomyomachia (line 180, ed.

Plates 12, 39. Second half of 4th century B.C. down through first half of 3rd century, perhaps a little later for 363. Dating based on stylistic similarities with the preceding types of the 25-group and on the finding places of 362 and 363. All the lamps in this type have one or more of the traits of the 25-group: the thick base, the enclosed body, the typical flat nozzle, or the use of grooves and ridges around the filling-hole. They are all wheelmade of local Attic clay. They can all be dated before 250 B.C., except perhaps 363 which shows by its nozzle that it is a transitional link with later Hellenistic lamps having tubular nozzles; this exceptional lamp is the latest in the long history of the Type 25's, and probably was made in the third quarter of the 3rd century B.c. In the first quarter of the 3rd century the pierced lug appears on lamps with added handles, 358 and 359. After half a century of use the pierced lug was shown to be impractical. It often broke off entirely (as on these two lamps and many more) since it was a small attached piece of clay and not always strong enough to maintain the weight of the lamp when suspended or moved about. If the pierced lug had been devised originally only to support a probe or poker it certainly would not have been broken so frequently. Perhaps it was felt that the pierced lugs were satis- factory for suspending groups of lamps in shops, but that individual customers felt the need for</page><page sequence="87">TYPE 25 VARIANTS 81 ordinary handles and did not like to be bothered with stringing a lamp for suspension when not in use. Lugs continued, generally solid, as vestigial appendages on some lamps with handles well into the 1st century after Christ. The two examples in this group mark a step between actual use and decorative survival. Two lamps, 356 and 357, are double, like lamps of Type 18, with both upper and lower reservoirs. The former lamp presumably used the lower reservoir for hot water, as the prototype. 357 could not have had anything in its hollow base as there are holes in it. This lamp is of mammoth proportions, so the void in the bottom was for the double purpose of lightening the weight of the object and ensuring proper firing; the holes were to allow the heat of the kiln to penetrate into the hollow base. A glazed lamp-cover, 364, need not necessarily belong to the 25-Groups, but its shape shows that it could have been used on a glazed lamp like those of Type 25 D Prime; it is catalogued here for convenience of association with the lamp-cover which belongs to Type 25 D Prime, 351. 356 (L 4008).

TYPE 26 A HIGH CENTRAL TUBES ON RODS; MULTIPLE LONG FLAT-TOPPED NOZZLES Nos. 365-371 (and 4 others inventoried). Plates 13, 40. From late in second quarter of 4th century B.C. down into early years of 3rd century. Dating based in part on the existence of this type at Olynthos "5 and in part on the Agora finding places. This type is related to the preceding members of Type 25 because of the groove around the filling-hole, the long straight-sided flat-topped nozzle, and the approximately same date. The chief individual characteristic, however, which is shared with other members of Types 26 and 27, is the vertical projection in the center that rises as a hollow tube or a solid rod. Lamps with central tubes have been seen earlier, of course, in Types 19 and 22, which are the forebears of these 4th century descendants. The bases are always raised, carefully defined, and fairly thick. The central vertical members might be considered as the continuations of the great masses of clay seen in normal lamps of Types 25 A and B, the masses pulled up vertically and hollowed out. Perhaps lamp-makers in the second quarter of the 4th century occasionally experimented with their large bases, convex on the inside, and pulled them up into central projections, at the same time recalling the central holes of old Type 22. Most of these central features in Type 26 A are open tubes, diminishing in their inner diameters toward the top, and rising approximately to the level of the rims. When the tube rises considerably higher than the rim it becomes a convenient handle for picking up the lamp; thus in 370 the terminal of the tube was given a knob, although the knob itself was open at the top, continuing the hollow cone below. In general the tubes are late descendants of the open centers of corona lamps, via Types 19 and 22 with shrunken holes; the central opening in the base gives an easy and useful grip to the fingers. A careful examination of Type 26 A shows, however, that all these lamps are equally 7 Olynthus, XIV, pp. 378-383.</page><page sequence="89">TYPE 26 A 83 balanced with two nozzles opposite each other or with many nozzles equally spaced; there are also unmistakable signs of wear on the interiors of some of the tubes. These two facts lead to the hypothesis that the central hole of Type 26 A was often used for suspending the lamp, by means of a cord passed through the tube and heavily knotted or knotted around a stick or stone below, so that it would not slip up through the aperture. The even balance and the signs of wear on the interior of the tubes also suggest a possible impaling on a stick, to elevate the lamp or to create a kind of primitive portable floor-lamp, not a table-lamp. This may well have served as the prototype for the elaborate bronze standing lamps of the late Hellenistic and early Roman periods. A few lamps, such as 369, have solid rods rising higher than the rims. These of course served as handles, and may well have ended in loops, again for occasional suspension as so many Olynthos lamps show.7s None of the Olynthos lamps, however, seem to have the low open tubes discussed above. It will be noted that no lamps of Type 26 A have lugs on their sides. They were not needed nor were conventional handles, since the central projections served their purposes. Type 26 A is approximately contemporary with Type 25 A, the last of the major Greek types to be made without lugs. The lamps tend to be very large, to hold a supply of oil sufficient for the two or more thirsty nozzles. They are neatly made of finely worked Attic clay and covered inside and largely outside with glossy black glaze that is inclined to flake on the later 4th century examples. The bases are normally unglazed; 366 is an exception. The groove around the rim is occasionally glazed along with the rest of the exterior, but more usual is a groove scraped of its glaze or carefully reserved and left untouched. 365 (L 635).

Dating based on stylistic analogies with Types 95 A and 26 A, and on the finding places. The outer profiles of this group as well as the flat-topped nozzles, fabric and glaze, and the use of grooves all recall corresponding features of Types 95 A and 26 A. What is unique is the completely covered body with a central tube, shaped like a doughnut and related to the kind of askos that appears in pottery categories in the 5th century and at least down into the early 4th century. The filling-hole is an added vertical member on top of the lamp, at the base of the nozzle. Like the askoi these lamps have basket handles that curve from the filling-hole over the central tube to the back of the lamp, or to the opposite part of the top (on 374) which has two nozzles opposite each other. There are no signs of wear inside the tubes, as on Type 26 A; this is to be expected, as of course the basket handle served for carrying or suspension and obviated the need for a cord or stick through the aperture as on the preceding type. This type is practical, because the body is enclosed to lessen the dangers of spilling or of predatory mice; it is equipped with a very useful kind of handle. The hole in the center, however, seems to be a bit of whimsy on the part of the makers, who combined this feature, which was distinctly useful on Type 26 A and which they were making during the same period, with the covered body that pottery makers knew. It is likely that the same people were producing pottery and lamps during most of the classical period; this type is an illustration of the two categories in conjunction. Since these whimsical productions are very few, they could be the product of a very small group of craftsmen, perhaps one or two, and the finding places permit a supposition that they might all have been made in a single decade, in the middle of the second half of the 4th century. The good Attic clay has black or brown glaze all over, inside and out, except for the scraped grooves around the top and the reserved base of 372. This latter lamp belonged to a man named Menon who was so insistent on establishing his possession that he scratched not only his name, but also its abbreviation and its initial on various surfaces. 372 (L 3042).

Dating based on some stylistic similarities to Type 26 B. Although more may exist elsewhere, only a single curious lamp has been found in the Agora to be placed in this group. 375 has a solid flat base, on a ring foot, but the body is an enclosed ring with a funnel at the base of the nozzle to serve as filling-hole, very similar to lamps of Type 26 A. The flat-topped nozzle is also similar to those of that type. The central space within the ring is merely a depression, a kind of deep cup, which could have been merely a useless void or possibly a receptacle for burning incense or perfume. This lamp also demonstrates an ingenuity or imagination on the part of the lamp-maker that allies him with the potter. A somewhat similar central cup was made on 191 several decades earlier. 375 (L 4506). Pls. 13, 40. H. (of top) 0.03 m.; D. 0.074 m.

Latter years of third quarter of 4th century B.C. through second quarter of 3rd century. Dating based on the fact that this type is found on the Pnyx before ca. 325 B.C."7 and on the Agora 77 Iesperia, Suppl. VII, pp. 44-45, nos. 85-86. finding places. These little lamps, almost miniatures, seem to have had some popularity and a fairly long life although they are extremely impractical, being hard to fill, holding very little oil, and likely to tip over. The general profile recalls to some extent those of Types 25 A and 26 A. There is always a raised base, flat or slightly concave on its resting surface. The sides curve slightly; there is a noticeable separation between the sides and the narrow, nearly flat top which is often decorated with a groove around it. The high sides and distinct flat top are in marked distinction to those features of Types 27 B and C which are low and rounded.</page><page sequence="92">86 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS There is uniformly a central tube that often crowds the interior space, rising to the height of the exterior walls, occasionally higher. There are no signs of wear within the tubes. It would be impractical to suspend these lamps, which are too small and unbalanced (with but a single nozzle) for such a purpose. The central openings may be considered here as relics of the old finger-holes of Types 19 and 22, rather than useful adjuncts for suspension as in Type 26 A. Moreover, none of the lamps of Type 27 A has a handle or a pierced lug. The central tube provides a very convenient grasping place, especially when the tube rises higher than the rim, with a finger in the bottom of the socket or tube and the thumb on its top. It is possible of course that these lamps might have been occasionally set on a short rod or spike, perhaps affixed vertically to a shelf, so that they would remain stationary and not tip over. There is always a single nozzle, not two as in Types 26 A or 27 D. The nozzle always offers a marked distinction to those of the preceding types and generation. No longer is there a long flat-topped protuberance, but here a broad shallow nozzle, usually semicircular in plan, with a little wick-hole taking up most of the top. The wick-hole does not encroach on the rim. These nozzles are most practical; they do not break off easily. All of the catalogued examples, and many others, still preserve intact their nozzles; this is far from being the case with lamps in the 25 and 26 types. The Attic clay is covered all over with good black glaze in the earlier, 4th century, examples; in the 3rd century the glaze tends to be flaky and of poorer quality. The grooves on the rims are sometimes glazed, sometimes scraped clean. Most of the bases are glazed, but an occasional lamp had its base reserved. 376 (L 4642). Pls. 13, 40. H.

There is usually an application of a thin clay slip over the unglazed surfaces that results in a smooth even finish; this is comparable to that seen on Types 25 A Prime and 25 B Prime. One of the lamps, 382, has a variation on the central tube motif. Here a solid central cone was made on the wheel and pierced afterwards when the clay was leather-hard. The hole was punched from the top downwards and is on a slant; this effectively disposes of any notion that the narrow tube was used for suspending the lamp while lighted, because it would have tipped considerably. 381 (L 1785).

About second half of 3rd century B.C., perhaps into early 2nd century. Dating based on the fact that this type is numerous at Priene, where it is dated in the 3rd century,7" and very common in Delos, where it is considered not earlier than the 3rd century B.c., running down into the Snd century.79 Only a single example from the Agora comes from a trustworthy context, 384. These lamps form a very small group locally; none are known from the neighboring excava- tions on the Pnyx or in the Kerameikos, so that it seems likely that only a few were imported from their Aegean center of origin. Athens had its own very flourishing lamp industry which exported widely, but copied foreign models very little until the introduction of exotic moulded designs (Type 45 A), which began to come in, incidentally, about the time of these scattered imports of Type 27 B. As a matter of fact this type, made abroad, was influenced by Athenian models of Types 27 A and 27 C. The small size, the comparatively large central tube, and the modest nozzle all reflect the slightly earlier Athenian lamps of Type 27 A. The curved sides merging with the rounded rim have their counterparts on Type 27 C. There is no proper raised base, as on most of the preceding types, but rather a flat bottom. There is no handle, but instead a small solid lug. In the first and second quarters of the 3rd century B.C. lugs were seen (on Type 25 B Prime) that were only partially pierced. Soon after that, about the middle of the century, solid lugs made their first appearance in a long sequence of such vestigial remainders. These lamps of Type 27 B can hardly be much earlier, then, than the late second quarter or middle of the 3rd century. The solid lug here has almost no function, 78 Priene, pp. 449-ff., nos. 165-170, figs. 555 and 556; cf. also p. 457 with references. 7i B.C.H., XXXII, 1908, p. 141, fig. 3.</page><page sequence="94">88 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS although it could be somewhat useful in gripping the lamp firmly if the outside were slippery with oil. In any case, the central tube could be used for a firm grip also, as in Type 27 A. Although there are no signs of wear within the tubes of either Types 27 A or 27 B they could sometimes have served for insertion over a spike on a shelf, to keep the lamp steady. The one extant nozzle is spoon-shaped rather than like the semicircular projections of the preceding two groups. This is totally unlike most Athenian nozzles of the period. Different, too, is the wick-hole which utilizes all of the nozzle's area rather than a small orifice in a proportionately large nozzle-top. The fabric is a rather thin clay, more buff than pink. The glaze used all over the lamps is flaky and fired red. These elements point to a foreign origin, since they are consistent on both lamps. Athenian clay and glaze, especially in the later Hellenistic and early Roman periods, may occasionally have looked like this in some of the variant manifestations, but at this time and with this consistency a foreign origin is indicated, perhaps Samos or the Asia Minor coast, from which Type 27 B was exported to Delos and occasionally to Athens. 383 (L 1296).

Dating based on the fact that this type is a stylistic development of Type 97 A and related stylistically to Type 97 B. These lamps are not found in 4th century B.C. contexts of the Pnyx with Type 27 A. It is impossible to ascertain the floruit of this small group of lamps very closely without further evidence, but the likelihood is that they were all made in a few shops during a rather short period, since they are so uniform. It may be suggested that they flourished during the later rather than the earlier years of their span, since they have more similarities to Type 27 B than to Type 27 A. Whether they served as models for imported Type 27 B or vice-versa is hard to say, but the nozzles indicate that at least they were not slavishly copied from these imports. Lamps of Type 27 C are found in Alexandria, which further confirms a date in the later years of the 3rd or in the 9nd century B.C. There is always a pronounced raised base with a concave surface beneath, curving walls that merge with the plain overhanging rim, and a very large central tube, the top of which is higher than the lamp's rim. No handles occur, nor lugs, a situation like that in Type 97 A. The nozzles are small handmade projections similar in their curved plan to those of Type 27 A, but not so clearly set off; in fact the wick-holes do not limit themselves to the nozzles but invariably intrude into the curved rims of the lamps. The clay seems to be an Attic fabric, but not the usual pinkish bluff; it is thin, rather coarse,</page><page sequence="95">TYPE 27 D 89 and buff in color.

Dating based on stylistic similarities with Type 27 C and on the finding places. These lamps may be considered as late descendants of Type 26 A, which oftentimes had nozzles opposite each other with a central rod for suspension; but they are more closely related to Type 27 C because of the generally rounded profile, the smaller size, and the absence of straight sides and completely flat tops on the nozzles. Some lamps of Type 27 D have neat raised bases; others have plain flat bottoms. In all cases the sides curve over into the rim, which usually continues the are but sometimes is flattened. A reminiscence of Type 26 A is the occasional vestige of a thin groove around the rim. All lamps have central projections that crowd the interiors; these are pulled up into tall solid rods whether the lower part of the projection is hollow or solid. The tops of the rods have added loops or pierced holes for suspension, similar in every way to the 4th century rods seen on Type 26 A and particularly on some of the Olynthian lamps."8 There is no morphological change whatsoever in the design of these rods, between the 4th century B.C. examples and these that continue in the later years of the 3rd century and down into the 2nd. Lamps with such central rods were never frequent; they were produced over a long period of time but in small numbers because they were never really practical. The rods broke easily; none of our ten examples is preserved with the complete rod attached to a more or less complete lamp. These projections in this type are the ultimate step in the long tradition of lamps with heavy central masses that began with Type 25 A in the second quarter of the 4th century. The rods served as handles, eliminating the need for more conventional appendages. There are solid lugs on some lamps, always used in pairs, one at the left of each nozzle. The lugs are useless of course but survive as reminders of the 4th century Type 26 A; they appear in pairs in order to balance the lamp when it is suspended. It so happens that all lamps with lugs also have raised bases (although not all raised bases support lamps with lugs); there is no chronological significance in this, merely the reminder of an older prototype when a lamp was given a definite base and a useful pierced lug. The nozzles are fairly long, tubular in section, with rounded tops, except for an occasional 80 Olynthus, XIV, pl. 157.</page><page sequence="96">90 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS example such as 389 that has a practically flat top recalling those of Types 26 A and B. The wick- hole area tends to be swollen and may end in blunted flukes, as 388. Such flukes, in a more extreme form, were introduced into Athenian lamp production via the imported Knidos lamps, Type 40 A, in the 2nd century B.C. Type 27 D is made of fairly good pinkish buff Attic clay; it is wheelmade, but a single moulded example exists, 819, classified under Miscellaneous Moulded Lamps. The glaze varies from a thick metallic black to a poor brown or brownish red; it is frequently thin and flaky.

Dating based in part on examples found in Corinth from contexts of this period,8' in part on the same fabric in dated vases,82 and in part on the finding places in the Agora. This very easily recognizable group has a curiously distinctive clay which is reminiscent of the unusual clay of Type 15, an earlier fabric. The clay of Type 28 A is thin, gritty, hard, but some- times brittle. Its surface is irregular with occasional bubbles or tiny blisters. It varies in color under differing firing conditions as does the clay of Type 15. Ordinary glaze was not used, but instead there is usually a thin wash or slip of gray or orange pink that is used inside and outside, but not consistently. The fabric is wheelmade with frequent traces of tooling when the clay was leather-hard, especially on and around the nozzles. The tooling as well as the somewhat irregular 81 Hesperia, XVII, 1948, p. 239, F 11: from a deposit dated just before 300 B.C. 82 Hesperia, III, 1934, p. 327, A 68: an amphoriskos dated at the turn of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.c.; and cf. pp. 470-471.

It is debatable whether these were Athenians or not, working with a local clay. Yet the vagaries of Attic clay are well known in the late Hellenistic and early Roman periods, when it took many kinds of textures and colors at the hands of various workers under assorted firing conditions; it must be remembered too that several banks of clay exist in the neighborhoods of Athens, not all alike by any means. In the 4th century, however, it is most unusual to see any radical departure from the various grades of recognizable pinkish buff in the Attic repertory of vase making; nor do the local coarse unglazed household pots of the 4th century betray many aberrations as different as the clay of Type 28 A. It is very possible that the fabric of Type 28 A may be a variety of Corinthian clay, since numerous lamps of this sort are found in Corinth and the related clay of Type 15 has been seen to be Corinthian. The shapes of the lamps recall some of the aspects of Type 25 D Prime, of approximately the same period, and indicate a strong influence from this type. Either there is a narrow ring foot or else the concave base is set off from the body by a groove. The curved side walls rise to the top where there is always a well defined circular groove at the point of junction. The top or broad rim is nearly flat, actually slightly convex. There is always a small round filling-hole without any groove or surrounding ridge. All the lamps have bold pierced lugs, appropriate for the last quarter of the 4th and first quarter of the 3rd centuries. A few lamps have thin vertical band handles in addition to the lugs, so that they could be carried about easily while lighted as well as strung up conveniently when not in use. The handmade nozzles are long, narrow, nearly flat on top with rounded terminations and small oval wick-holes at their extremities. 397 (L 3525). Pls. 14, 41. H. 0.035 m.; D. 0.064 m. Intact.

Corinth: classified under Type IX. Early to late years of 3rd century B.c., but primarily in first half of century. Dating based on stylistic similarities with Type 28 A and on the finding places. Type 28 B has the same fabric and use of washes or slips that characterize the preceding type. There is the same variety of colors in the clay and exterior coating; the same remarks on origin apply to both types. This group differs in that it is later in date and has a very different profile, usually angular. The base may be raised and noticeably concave, in the earlier specimens of approximately the first quarter of the 3rd century; the base may be flat or only slightly concave in the later specimens, in the second half of the 3rd century. The sides curve and merge with the rounded top, in the earlier lamps, but the sides have a watch-shaped angular profile in the later examples. There is always a little groove and ridge concentrically arranged around the filling-hole. These were con- spicuously absent on the preceding type. On Type 28 B there is never a ridge around the lamp at the junction of sides and top. There is normally no handle, although one uncatalogued example has a vertical band handle like that of 398 of Type 28 A. There is always a lug; this is pierced in the earlier examples, solid in the later examples, but these can only be dated stylistically around the end of the first quarter of the 3rd century or slightly later, by analogy with Type 25 B Prime's semi-pierced lugs; the use of a groove and a ridge around the filling-hole also recalls features of Type 25 B Prime, as well as of contemporary Type 29 A. The lugs on Type 28 B show clearly the progression from usefulness to partial obsolescence to vestigial remainders. The nozzles are like those of the preceding type in every way, with considerable traces of paring on their rounded or flattened tops. 401 (L 3524). Pls. 14, 41. H. 0.030 m.; D. 0.065 m. Intact.

TYPE 29 A LAMPS WITH WATCH-SHAPED LAGYNOS PROFILES; NARROW RIDGES AROUND FILLING-HOLES Nos. 406-414 (and 20 others inventoried). Plates 14, 24, 41. Corinth: classified under Type IX. Last quarter of 4th century B.C. and well into second quarter of 3rd century. Dating based partly on the fact that none are found in deposits on the Pnyx antedating ca. 325 B.C., partly on the similarity in painted decoration between some lamps and pottery dated after 275 B.c., and partly on the Agora finding places. These crisp neatly made lamps are related to those of Type 25 in the continued use of an emphatic circular groove around the filling-hole; they also offer an origin for the angular profile seen in Type 28 B. The profile is very carefully drawn, with a raised base concave on its under surface, and usually with the shallow disc which was seen so often in the Type 25 lamps. The bodies are broad and flat with a distinct angle between the upper and lower halves, as in contemporary lagynoi; the upper part of the walls of the body serves as the top of the lamp. The filling-hole has a groove around it and usually a thick ridge or rim; on a few lamps this rim may be drawn up into a neat vertical collar. Some of the later (3rd century) examples have multiple grooves around the collar rather than a single one, and an added groove at the angle marking the junction of the two parts of the body. The interiors of the early (4th century) lamps often show a large hump of clay in the bottom, recalling the convex masses of the related 25 Types. The later lamps do not have such conspicuously thick bases as a rule. The use of a lug is almost universal; it is missing on only a couple of lamps that have service- able handles. Normally the lug is fully pierced and is used on lamps without handles. A few of the latest lamps, those of the late first quarter or second quarter of the 3rd century, have the lug pierced with a very small hole indeed, or have solid lugs. This type thus exhibits again the change in the function of the lug during the first quarter of the 3rd century. When the handles occur they are broad vertical band handles and accompany lamps with solid lugs, although rarely one is found with a pierced lug. Handles are used only on the later lamps of this series. The nozzles are normally long and flat with rounded ends, like those of Types 25. One exceptional nozzle is on 414; this is rounded on top, blunted on the end, with a slight indication of flukes. It is decorated with an incised herringbone pattern; the shape is late, typical of nozzles that are usually classed in the 2nd century B.C., since flukes seem to arrive in Athens with lamps of the Knidos type (40 A). It would seem that 414 is a late survival of its type and might indeed be classed as a distinct and unique variant. The lamps are made of good pinkish buff Attic clay. The black glaze is smooth and hard on the earlier examples, flaky and thin on the later ones. The interiors are glazed, of course, as are most of the surfaces of the exteriors. The bases are generally left unglazed in the early</page><page sequence="101">TYPE 29 A 95 lamps but covered in the later specimens. The grooves are sometimes reserved but usually scraped of glaze after it was applied, but before firing. The groove and scraping were occasionally done in one operation as 413 shows; here the scraped groove surrounds most of the lamp but no groove extends into the little area under the handle, as it would if the groove were made around the lamp before the handle was added, and then scraped clear of glaze in all but the handle area. One lamp, 412, has a wreath painted in thinned clay on its upper side. This is actually West Slope decoration 83 and shows a close bond again between the potter and lamp fabricant." It is interesting to see decoration on a West Slope lagynos s" very similar to the decoration on this lamp with its lagynos type of profile. The two objects could have been the product of the same shop and might even be by the same hand. Other lagynoi of the same period have similar profiles and decoration.86 In recapitulation one may roughly divide lamps of Type 29 A into earlier and later groups, although there can be no clear demarcation between them either stylistically or chronologically. Generally speaking those that are early within the type have more acute angles in the profiles, well pierced lugs, reserved bases, better glaze, and reserved grooves. Those that are late within the type tend to be less carefully executed, but show added decorative features. 406 (L 3041). Pls. 14, 41. H. 0.032 m.; D. 0.083 m. Intact except for small chip from side.

TYPE 29 B LAMPS WITH WATCH-SHAPED LAGYNOS PROFILES; FLAT RIMS AROUND FILLING-HOLES Nos. 415-416 (and 1 other inventoried). Plates 15, 41. First quarter and into second quarter of 3rd century B.C. Dating based on stylistic similarities to late examples of Type 29 A and on the finding place of 416. These lamps are comparable in most respects to the later examples of Type 29 A. There is seen a similar raised base, concave on its under surface, with or without the little raised disc. The sides are double-convex, with a noticeable if not sharp angle between the upper and lower halves. There is a groove around the filling-hole but a broad band replaces the ridge or collar of Type 29 A and serves as a rim; this rim may be either flat or slightly concave, and is the type's distinguishing feature. None of the lamps has a handle, although the rear portions where handles might have existed are broken off on two examples. All the examples have lugs which in this particular type are characterized by very thin holes, pierced apparently by an instrument as thin as a needle, and wider at the top than at the bottom. These holes are practically useless although a thin string could have been drawn through some of them; they could have served to hold thin wick-pokers. Such narrow holes mark again a transitional step from the fully pierced to the solid lug. The nozzles are long, nearly flat on top, with rounded ends, recalling the usual nozzle form of Type 29 A. The pinkish buff Attic clay is covered with fairly good black glaze, including the bases of the lamps. Sometimes the grooves are scraped, with an occasional use of added miltos here; sometimes they are uniformly covered with the black glaze used elsewhere on the lamp. These lamps form the transitional link between the enclosed bodies of Type 29 A and the later, more developed forms, of Types 31, 32, 33, etc. that have depressed rims around the filling-holes. 415 (L 1727).

Late 5th century B.C. and well into first half of 4th century. Dating based on stylistic simi- larities to Types 23 A and 25 A, and on the finding places. All members of Types 30 are isolated morphologically from Types 29 and the members of the 31 Types. They are introduced at this point, however, because Types 30 B and 30 C belong here in the early Hellenistic development of wheelmade lamps; Type 30 A is their predecessor. Type 30 A is a link with Type 23 A, and dates back toward the end of the 5th century. It includes a very small group of carefully made lamps, rather a contrast to their more carelessly constructed progeny. The base is flat, the sides are in two planes of which the lower is short and straight, the upper taller and curved. A narrow flat rim crowns the wall. There are no handles; of course there are no lugs since these features were not used before the middle of the 4th century. The well made flat-topped nozzles are related to the neat nozzles that were beginning to come in Type 25 A just as Type 30 A was fading. The fine Attic clay is uniformly covered inside and out, except for the reserved bottoms, with a respectable black or brown glaze. 417 (L 611). Pls. 15, 41. H. 0.030 m.; D. 0.069 m.

They do not reflect the popular interest in lugs; they show no signs of the gradual enclosing of the body. They do not form a proper group because of minor variations from each other, but they are placed here as an indication that some</page><page sequence="104">98 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS customers existed for the cheap little traditional types during the periods of continued experimen- tation and change. Type 30 B is reminiscent of Types 23 A and 30 A. There is a flat bottom or simple raised base; 421 has a simulated raised base because of the groove around the lowest part of its side walls. The walls are curved and either merge into a curved rim or meet a narrow flat rim that slopes inwardly. There is no sharp profiling on these lamps. Only one lamp has a handle, which is of the early horizontal band variety seen so often on Type 25 A and earlier lamps. The nozzles are usually crude handmade addenda, flat on top and stubby at the ends. The clay is always Attic, but the glaze varies with the period of production; it is noticeably flaky in the later, 3rd century, lamps. The entire exterior and interior of every lamp is coated except for the base of 422, which thus must be fairly early within the group. This little lamp is a miniature, a child's toy, but signs of burning indicate that it was once used. 419 (L 2890). Pls. 15, 41. H. 0.037 m.; D. 0.066 m. Intact except for small chip from side.

There is a flat base with the swirled wheel-marks clearly visible rather than smoothed off. The curving sides go up to and merge with the overhanging rim. There is no handle nor lug. The rounded broad nozzle projects very little, so that the wick-hole encroaches noticeably onto the rim. The clay of the Agora example is buff, rather coarse, and with occasional air bubbles; it is not micaceous. It is possible that this fabric represents a foreign ware, and the fact that so few of these lamps are found in Athens compared to those elsewhere supports this theory. There is no glaze in the interior, a most unusual feature for an Attic lamp of this period; on the exterior there is a dull red wash on the upper portions only.

Ca. second and third quarters of 3rd century B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarities with Types 28 B and 29 A, and on the finding place of 424. This single lamp is classed as a separate type because it represents the wheelmade counterpart of the nearly contemporary moulded lamps of Type 43 A; others like it presumably exist although unexcavated. It also represents the next logical step in the 3rd century development of Hellenistic lamps from Types 28 B and 29 A. It is in fact an amalgam of these two types which, in a moulded form, became extremely popular around the third quarter of the 3rd century. The profile shows a concave raised base, sides curving into the top, and a small filling-hole surrounded by a groove and a ridge. The Agora specimen has no handle, but possesses a solid lug, appropriate for a mid-3rd century date. The nozzle is long and flat like those of Type 29 A. Attic clay forms the fabric, which is glazed all over with a typically 3rd century reddish black glaze. It might be debatable whether this type influenced the moulded Type 43 A or vice-versa. Since Type 31 comes so evidently out of two wheelmade prototypes that were not frequently nor accurately copied in moulded forms, it seems certain that Type 31 served as model for the moulded counterparts. 424 (L 1929).

This progression serves as a criterion for dating the lamps early or late within the type; 432 might be the oldest and 430 among the latest. The profiles show bases that are occasionally flat, but usually decidedly raised and concave beneath, sometimes with the thin raised disc seen on Type 25; these would be early within the type. The sides have a noticeably double-convex profile, as in the parent Types 29 A and B. The tops range from narrow rims to deep concavities as mentioned above. The sunken tops mark the earliest appearance of this feature which will be so important a characteristic of later Greek and especially Roman lamps, when it will be known as a discus. The tops that are noticeably concave are set off from the sloping sides by grooves. There is normally a pierced lug, especially on those lamps without handles; a few lamps have solid lugs; one, 431, has no lug at all but is furnished with a handle. Although most lamps are handleless and rely on the pierced lug for suspension when not in use, a few tall vertical band handles exist. These are used in conjunction with pierced lugs with the exception of 431. There is no regular rule for the use of handles and lugs, but the frequent custom is for a pierced lug to occur on a handleless lamp and the solid lug, late within the type, on lamps with handles. The nozzles are long, flat on top or nearly so, and rounded or blunted at the end. The blunted ends are typical of the 3rd century, a transition between the rounded nozzles of all earlier lamps and the suggestion of flukes that are used on some lamps during the 2nd century B.c. and later. The lamps are carefully made of conventional Attic pinkish buff clay; they are glazed inside and out, including the bases and grooves, with a rather thin black glaze that is inclined to flake. The use of glaze on the bases marks them off from most 4th century and early 3rd century lamps. This group is important not only as the inheritor of the tradition of Types 29 A and B, but because it is a transitional link in passing on the sequence to Types 33, 34, and 35. 425 (L 4372).

Last quarter of 3rd century B.C. into third quarter of 2nd century. Dating based on the stylistic development from Type 32 and on the finding places. Type 33 A is a rather amorphous group of lamps that reflects the general decline in the craft that characterizes wheelmade examples of this era. In the early years of the 3rd century moulded lamps had been introduced (Type 42 A and succeeding types); the more competent and imagina- tive craftsmen seem to have been occupied with these, leaving the production of the older forms to less progressive fabricants. From now on the wheelmade lamps degenerate, although they persist feebly in Athens into the 1st century after Christ. Type 33 A is a pathetic development from Type 32 and its predecessors. Its forms are irregular, not following a definite set pattern; they last for a fairly long time. The bottoms are sometimes flat, but more usually constructed with a raised base that is concave beneath, with or without a concave disc; an occasional specimen may have a simple concave bottom. The curved sides show the chief characteristic of the type; they maintain only a suggestion of the double convexity of the preceding types. The tops are sometimes covered by a continuation of the sides, but normally the tops are enclosed by a sunken depression that continues the tradition of the central concavity of Type 32. The central depressions are seldom as well formed as those of Type 32. They vary greatly, from a well defined concave top or discus to a sunken circular rim around the filling-hole. There is often a thin circular groove with or without a blurred ridge at the junction of walls and top. These profiles are seldom crisp like those of Types 32 and 35, and prevent the formulation of any accurate criteria for dating these lamps more closely or for dividing them into sub-groups. With very few exceptions the lamps of Type 33 A have lugs, solid or pierced. The two examples, 436 and 442, that assuredly did not have lugs are equipped with high vertical band handles. In the late years of the 3rd century B.C. and early years of the 2nd there seems to be a renaissance of the pierced lug. It has been seen that they went out of use by the second quarter of the 3rd century; but later on, after a generation or two, they became prevalent again on both wheelmade and moulded lamps. This revival of the hole in the lug lasted during much of the 2nd century B.C., although it did not entirely supplant the solid lug during these years. Handles of the vertical band variety appear on about half the lamps of Type 33 A, but they are used indiscriminately on lamps with no lug, a pierced lug, or a solid lug; there is no standard</page><page sequence="108">102 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS pattern. The nozzles are long, flat or only slightly rounded on top, with oval wick-holes well removed toward the ends which may be rounded or blunt. The flat-topped rounded nozzles are earlier, characteristic of 4th and 3rd century B.c. lamps in general. The blunted ends tend to be later. 441 has an added handmade collar around the entire lamp to collect oil that might be spilled in filling. Usually the concave top served admirably as a sort of funnel for directing the oil into the filling-hole, but as the central openings became smaller on these enclosed lamps of the 3rd and 2nd centuries more and more oil perhaps was spilled, more than a concave top would hold. The protective collar was invented to catch the extra oil and to drain it back into the reservoir through several holes conveniently punched in the cavity between the collar and the convex walls of the upper part of the lamp. Earlier lamps with wide, open tops did not need this collar. If any oil spilled, or if any oil seeped through the porous clay of the lamp despite the inner and sometimes outer glazing of the base,89 the careful housewife could place a saucer or small plate under the lamp."9 Protective collars of the same type are used on mouldmade lamps, but the earliest one known, 541, is earlier than the example discussed here and dates probably from the late 3rd century B.C. All the lamps of Type 33 A may be of Attic clay, although it may be questioned whether the gray clay of 441 is a burned local fabric or an imported example of Asia Minor Gray Ware. A feature which appears here for the first time is the interior finish, or actually lack of finish, of the bottoms. Many of the lamps of Type 33 A, but not the earliest, have pronounced whirls or spirals of clay betraying the finger of the lamp maker as the clay swirled around on the wheel while he was drawing up the body of the lamp from its base. All earlier lamps have their floors carefully smoothed. These unlevelled swirls of clay show less careful or less competent workmen and add another item to the list of comparatively inept characteristics of this class of "poor relations." Since the filling-holes are now very small, a craftsman's fingers have little room to enter the cavity for careful interior finishing which could, indeed, be scarcely noticed. It is not always easy to detect the spiral in a well preserved lamp; broken fragments that expose the interiors are more revealing. This whirl of clay in the bottom is not confined to Type 33 A, but will appear in subsequent wheelmade lamps of the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. The black glaze is usually thin and flaky, varying in hue through various gradations of red to brown. It is applied all over the entire lamp. There are no reserved bases; these seldom appear in lamps after the mid 3rd century B.C. There is also no decorative scraping or reserving of the grooves on these cheaply made products. Some examples of Type 33 A are similar to some of the lamps of the Esquiline Cemetery in Rome.9 There is no actual Esquiline Type,92 since the lamps from this cemetery are for the most part Greek exports of a variety of types, including our Types 29 A, 33 A, 34 A, and 35 A.93 The Esquiline lamps all have closed bodies, however, and can be dated (by analogy with the Agora lamps) as a group covering the entire 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. It is more accurate to say that 89 Experiments have shown that lamps thinly glazed on both interiors and exteriors nevertheless exude oil and leave stains on wooden tables. 90 No saucers have been found in undisputed conjunction with or under lamps, in deposits or tombs of the classical era in Greece. In Punic burials at Carthage the saucer almost invariably accompanies the unglazed lamp. There are scores of examples of the lamp and saucer combination (unpublished) in the Musee Alaoui in Tunis. 91 Annali dell' Instituta, LII, 1880, pp. 265-342, pls. O, P. 92 But cf.

These lamps are nearly the same as those of the preceding type, and have close connections in particular with some of Type 33 A that come from fillings dated in the earlier years of that type's floruit. There is a curved profile, plain concave top, no handle, and a solid lug on the one well preserved specimen of Type 33 B. The characteristic element is the tall wheelmade column on which the lamp is affixed. None is preserved in its entirety with a base, but enough remains to show a tall shaft diminishing toward the top where there is a flaring support for the lamp, not unlike a Doric echinus." The lamps and shafts are of good Attic clay that is covered all over with flaky thin black glaze. A noteworthy feature is the use of decorative horizontal bands of added white paint, a narrow one at the junction of lamp and shaft with broader bands at intervals around the shaft.

Type 34 A is another group of lamps that reflects, like Type 33 A, the decline in craftsmanship in wheelmade lamps during the later 3rd and much of the 2nd centuries B.C. Type 34 A also is a continuation, but a debased one, of Type 32. Many features are like those of the preceding type but the distinctive characteristic here is the angular profile of the sides, with the upper half about the same in height and angle as the lower half; not until the more crisply shaped Type 35 A did the upper slope become predominant over the lower.

It is found in vast numbers in Athens and was exported to other Greek cities and to Rome."' It was the most frequently used type of wheelmade lamp during the later Hellenistic period, replacing in popularity the lamps of Type 25 B Prime. As in the related lamps of Type 33 A, the bases vary. They may be raised and concave in profile, or completely flat, or slightly concave with or without a central disc; the central disc effect is often achieved by making a deep groove around the perimeter of the base, which gives the appearance of a cheaply made base ring with a central disc within it. The raised bases would seem to be earlier than the flat bases. The walls have roughly angular profiles, but not crisp neat ones as in the ancestral Types 29 B and 32; sometimes there appears only a slight trace of this double convexity. The tops of the lamps are always depressed below the level of the walls, with a concave top or discus. There is not usually any clear demarcation between the top of the walls and the central concavity, although occasionally there may be a shallow groove here, and a very few lamps that are late within the type have a scraped circle at this junction. The central con- cavities are uniformly more definite and noticeable than many of the treatments of the tops on the contemporary Type 33 A. A few lamps have an added raised band of clay around the filling- hole, as 450. The lug is seen on almost every example; it may be pierced or solid, or with a very narrow needle-thin hole, following the vagaries of related 2nd century B.C. lamps. Broad vertical band handles occur on about half the lamps. Those lamps without handles normally have well-pierced lugs as one would expect; lamps with handles utilize all the varieties of lug. The nozzles are medium to long, although apparently the length of the nozzle does not offer a criterion for dating within the type. The ends of the nozzles may be rounded or blunted, following usual late Hellenistic forms. 454 has pronounced flukes at the angles and reflects the influence of imported 2nd century models. The tops of the nozzles are inclined to be flat in the earlier lamps, with straight sides; the later ones have rounded contours. As on Type 33 A, the interior floors of some examples have the unfinished swirl of clay that betrays a 2nd century B.c. date. All are of easily recognizable Attic clay, used in a fairly thick fabric. A thin worn black glaze is used all over the lamps, inside and out. A few late lamps, which perhaps come from a single workshop, have a very heavy scraping not only of the glaze but of a sliver of clay also, around the line that marks the junction of the walls with the central concavity. It is apparent that this scraping occurred just before the lamp was fired, while leather-hard but with the glaze already applied. This is an easier process than creating a reserved band in the application of a glazed coating, and illustrates another aspect of the cheap and rapid production of Type 34 A. 445 (L 3077).

Yet 463 has among its ten nozzles some that are rounded, others perceptibly blunt. When the nozzles are only three in number their tops are nearly level with the tops of the angular walls. When the lamps are very large the numerous nozzles are set further down on the lamp, at the angle between the two halves where the lamp's circumference is greatest and will accommodate more outlets. It is interesting to note that the nozzles are always about the same size, whether the lamp itself is average in dimensions or huge. There can be only a single wick to a nozzle, so there is no point in having very large nozzles proportionate in size to the lamp. To gain more light the size of the oil reservoir was increased, and more nozzles of normal size were added around the increased circumference. Many of these lamps were for domestic use in affluent households. About half of the inven- toried lamps of this type were found in the area of private houses along the lower northwestern slopes of the Areopagus, where many Athenians had their residences in the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.c. Some of the very large lamps may have been used in sanctuaries, although none was found incontrovertibly allied to a temple deposit. Such very large lamps would seem to be the Hellenistic descendants of the multi-nozzled corona lamps devoted to sanctuary use during the archaic and classical periods. The profiles of the lamps show a variety of bases ranging from a flat raised base to a ring foot. The bodies are double-convex with a perceptible, if somewhat rounded, angle between the halves except in very large lamps where the numerous nozzles fill nearly the entire circumference. The tops are noticeably concave but usually without marked angles between them and the side walls; only a few lamps retain a thin groove or grooves here, which may be emphasized by scraping away the glaze. All lamps have broad vertical band handles, proportionate to the size of the lamps and equal to the heavy loads that some have to support. In the very large lamps the handles spread out onto the rims for additional grips. 463 has vestigial remains of a wide lateral spread that appear as two small lugs on the edge of its rim. One lamp, 458, with only three nozzles, retains a remnant of the once-useful lug, appearing here as a solid lug at the left of the handle; usually there is no room on the lamp's periphery for such a feature. Type 34 B is made of Attic clay in a well worked fairly thick fabric. In the later lamps the swirl of clay usually remains on the floor, as on the preceding type. The thin black glaze, often flaked, is used all over, both on interiors and exteriors except for an occasional scraped groove around the central depression. A few late lamps have the glaze and a bit of clay scraped from the angle between walls and concave top, a mannerism seen on some late lamps of Type 34 A and perhaps emanating from the same shop that produced those specimens. 457 (L 3828).

Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 34 A and B. This miscellany includes one unglazed lamp, 464, which is otherwise like Type 34 A. No separate type exists for an unglazed variety since only this one example has been found, as compared to fifty-three inventoried lamps and hundreds of uninventoried fragments of the glazed type. This one unglazed lamp would seem to be a sport rather than a representative of a very small group. It is not an unfinished lamp because it has signs of use as well as a dipinto. Another member of this variant class is a lamp; 465, distinguished by its abnormally large size, which has many characteristics of Type 34 B but apparently only a single nozzle, like Type 34 A. A third unusual lamp, 466, very fragmentary, has an odd gritty clay which is unlike Attic; it presumably is an importation, but its source is unknown and not enough of it is preserved to classify it more definitely than as a variant. Its interior has the characteristic swirl of clay that is seen often in Types 34 A and B, and the lower part of its profile, as well as its nozzle, allies it further to these types. 464 (L 2122).

Last quarter of 2nd century B.C. and at least into first quarter of 1st century B.C., perhaps a little later. Dating based on the stylistic similarities to and development from 34 A, as well as on the finding places. After the careless banalities of Types 33 A and 34 A it is refreshing to see a large group of wheelmade lamps that were carefully and crisply made during the generation before Sulla's invasion. In this period the moulded lamps were offering very lively competition; Type 35 A was the effective answer to this. The forms developed out of those of Type 34 A, but with sharper articulations and with more emphasis on height than on breadth. The bases of about half the lamps are flat; the others are raised with a flat or slightly concave surface. The sides are in two well marked planes, with a pronounced angle between them placed very low on the body, so that there is much more emphasis on the tall inward sloping sides above the angle than on the broad low outward sloping sides below it. The lower sides may indeed be so minimized that they are practically identical with the raised base, as on 469. There is always a pronounced ridge or rim between the top of the walls and the deeply sunken top or discus; the top is slightly concave, as on the preceding types, but often approaches a completely flat plane, with a simple filling-hole in the center. A few of the earlier lamps have a circular groove marking the junction between sides and top; such lamps tend to have rather broad proportions and thus mark the actual transition between Types 34 A and 35 A. All of these lamps have lugs which are uniformly solid except on the few examples without handles, where they appear with adequate pierced holes. The majority of the lamps are equipped with broad vertical band handles. It seems possible to date the lamps with pierced lugs and no handles early within the type, because the solid lugs used with handles are typical of later lamps, of the 1st century B.C. and early 1st century after Christ (in both wheelmade and moulded cate- gories). The nozzles are uniformly rounded on top, roughly tubular in cross-section; they are emphasized more than they were on preceding types, since they are apt to be wide and long, often longer than the diameter of the body. The usual termination around the wick-hole is blunted or fluked, reflecting late 2nd century B.C. influences from abroad (cf. Type 40 A). A few nozzles that belong to lamps late within the type have swollen oval ends with a flattened band around the</page><page sequence="116">110 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS wick-hole. These may reflect similar terminations seen on contemporary imported lamps of Type 49 A, or they may be crude imitations of the thin flat rims seen sometimes around the wick-holes of contemporary bronze lamps. The sharp articulations of Type 35 A recall in general the pre- cision of metal prototypes, although no particularly appropriate example of a metal original can be cited. Attic clay is used, with an occasional appearance of the whirl of clay on the floor as on the preceding types. Since such an unfinished bottom is rare on these well made lamps and since such a characteristic is seen so often on the carelessly made types of the 2nd century B.c., it may be assumed that its use died out sometime before the beginning of the 1st century B.c. A thin black glaze, often flaky but sometimes hard and metallic, is used all over the exteriors and interiors, except for an occasional decorative scraping of the glaze around the bold ridge at the top of the walls. 467 (L 1886).

Late 2nd century B.C. to late 1st century B.C. Dating based on stylistic relationships to Type 35 A and on the finding places. This group is very much like Type 35 A except that the lamps are equipped with two to five nozzles. It may be noted that the bodies are not noticeably larger than those of the parent type, as are some of the huge multi-nozzled lamps of Type 34 B. These are small lamps for domestic use but constructed to give more light than the normal varieties. The nozzles are usually long and tubular with blunted or angular terminations; the latter are the latest, and will be seen frequently on other lamps of the 1st century B.C., both wheelmade and moulded. The angular pointed nozzle is a significant feature on many Ephesos lamps (Type 49 A) which were imported in great numbers during the floruit of Type 35. A few lamps early in the type have small nozzles with nearly flat tops, as on 478; these are more closely allied to Type 34 B than are the others. Two nozzles may be set opposite each other, or two may be placed close together opposite the handle; such distributions of the nozzles do not occur among the lamps of Type 34 B; there, as well as on the others here, the nozzles are more or less evenly spaced around the circumferences of the bodies. The profiles show a variety of bases, like those of Type 35 A; there is often a base-ring or a simulated base-ring. The sides show greater concentration and height on their upper slopes than on their lower parts. The proportions are high and narrow compared to the low spreading profiles of the earlier multiple-nozzled lamps. There is always a deeply depressed top or discus, concave or nearly flat; sometimes this is surrounded by a narrow groove. All the lamps have handles, usually the normal vertical band. A sporadic use is made of a basket handle, bridging the top of the lamp, used when there are two nozzles opposite each other; these are useful for suspension since the lamps are evenly balanced. Filling such lamps is not seriously impeded by the handles since oil poured anywhere into the concave tops drains into the filling-holes. A few of the lamps with only two or three nozzles have solid lugs, placed at the left of a vertical handle when used singly or used in pairs with a basket handle. The lamps with more than three nozzles do not have space for these vestigial excrescences. Attic clay furnishes the fabric; a few of the earlier lamps, e. g. 475 and 477, have the spiral of clay on the floor that appeared so frequently in the 2nd century B.C. A thin flaky black glaze, sometimes fired red or reddish brown, covers the lamps within and without except for a few instances of scraping around the ridge that borders the sunken top.</page><page sequence="118">112 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS 474 (L 4038).

Dating based on the similarity with Type 35 C Prime; the character of the glaze and its careless use are reminiscent of that seen on some moulded lamps of the 1st century after Christ. Here the profile shows a pronouncedly straight side, a bevel at the lower part of the body, and a flat bottom. These features are at variance with the corresponding characteristics of Type 35 A, but the depressed tops of both are similar. In Type 35 C there are one or two little drain-holes punched in the top, in addition to the small central filling-hole. The nozzles are short and stubby, with the ends wider than the necks; the large wick-holes occupy most of the nozzle area. There is uniformly a thick vertical band handle with a groove down its center. The lug is never seen. The fabric is very thick and presumably Attic, of the normal pinkish buff color. Poor black</page><page sequence="119">TYPE 35 C PRIME 113 to brown glaze is used both within and without, but carelessly applied and not covering the entire surface; it is spotty, showing that the lamps were hastily painted, rather than completely dipped in glaze. These lamps are the successors of Type 35 A, but made only occasionally during the years when moulded lamps were far more popular. These are among the latest wheelmade lamps in the whole development of classical lamp manufacture. The type was never common in Athens; its prototype may have been the contemporary Corinthian unglazed lamps (Corinth Type XVI, third group) as well as Athenian Type 35 A. The clay, however, shows Type 35 C undoubtedly to be local, and the absence of the lug at the side,97 as well as the glaze, suggest that it is a product of the turn of the era and of the 1st century after Christ. 481 (L 3827).

There is no lug, and the handle, missing on 482, may or may not have had a groove down its center like those of Type 35 C. The clay is a thick creamy pink Attic fabric.

Plates 17, 43. Corinth: classified as Type XVI, third group. Late 1st century B.C. and 1st century after Christ. Dating based on close similarities to the popular Corinthian Type XVI (third group) and some stylistic similarity to Type 35 C Prime. These very simple, cheaply made, lamps are rarely seen in Athens. One of them must certainly be an importation from Corinth, perhaps brought up by an individual rather than imported commercially. The others, of a slightly different color,. may also be importations. The profiles show the conventional curved sides of the Corinthian Type XVI (third group), rising from rough round bottoms; 484 is more carefully finished than the normal, irregular, 483. The tops are flat rather than concave (as seen on Type 35 C); they are sunk below the tops of the walls, as if depressed to receive covers. No covers have ever been found, however, that may be associated with lamps such as these. The filling-hole is large in proportion to the diameter of the top, and without subsidiary drain-holes. No lugs appear on these lamps. The nozzles are blunt; that of 484 is perfectly rectangular, while that of 483 has flaring projections at the end, where it is wider than it is at the point of junction with the body of the lamp. The oval wick-holes are large and, as in Type 35 C, occupy most of the nozzle area. There is always a vertical ribbon handle, thinner than that seen on Type 35 C. The fabric is com- paratively thin and brittle; one lamp is unglazed, and of the typical red clay seen in Corinthian- made examples. 483 and another inventoried example have red clay of a slightly heavier texture, although still brittle, covered with a thin buff slip. These two lamps are carelessly made, with the nozzles and handles set awry. It is difficult to date lamps of Type 35 D precisely. Their Corinthian counterparts offer little help, and our examples come from contexts that give no more assistance. If these are to be con- sidered the Corinthian models from which the few Athenian lamps of Type 35 C were adapted, then they must have been made around the turn of the era. If, however, Type 35 C should be considered a development of Type 35 A, an Attic type, these lamps of Type 35 D, of Corinthian origin, could fall anywhere in the late 1st century B.c. and throughout most of the 1st century after Christ. 483 (L 856).

Dating based on the nozzle formations, similar to those of Types 25 A and 30 B, and on the finding places. All lamps of Types 36 and 37 have collars around their filling-holes which facilitate the pouring of oil into the reservoirs. Types 36 A and B are early versions related to, but not closely enough to assign to, various 4th and 3rd century types. Types 37 A-C are later manifestations, which were to be influenced not only by these lamps of the earliest Hellenistic epochs but more directly by their near contemporaries, lamps of Types 35. These lamps of Type 36 A have no connections with Types 35, but are inserted here as a prelude to their offspring, lamps of Types 37. Type 36 A forms a very small group with only two inventoried specimens. They are reminiscent of other 4th century lamps with their rather globular bodies resting on flat or slightly raised bases. Their distinguishing feature, however, is the upper curve of the side walls that flares out to form a high convex-concave profile. The flaring top of the sides becomes the collar and rim; this feature is not added separately. There are no lugs on the bodies. The handles are flat vertical bands and among the earliest vertical handles to re-appear after the 6th century; 5th century and most 4th century lamps have horizontal band handles when there is any appendage at all. The nozzles are either long, flat on top, and rounded on their ends, like the normal nozzles of Type 25 A, or are broad at their base and tapering, blunt and roughly triangular in shape with small wick-holes, like those of Type 30 B. The dull gray clay and dull black glaze, sparingly used, seen on 486 show that this is an imported Eastern lamp. This is an ancestor of the very popular and much later Egyptian "pitchers" lamps of the late Hellenistic period, and a prototype of the Arabic and Byzantine</page><page sequence="122">116 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS globular lamps."9 It is interesting to see such an early example entering Greece in the second half of the 4th century B.C., but leaving so little direct influence. 487 is one of the few local lamps produced as an adaptation. Its clay and all over black glaze show it to be Attic. The later adaptations are sporadic, and listed under Type 36 B; a weakened influence of Type 36 A persists, however, in the late Hellenistic lamps of Types 37 A and B. 486 (L 2900). Pls. 17, 44.

Dating based on some stylistic similarities with late examples of Types 25 A and B, and with Type 29 B. The finding place of 490 is helpful. Type 36 B also has collars which are the flaring upper parts of the side walls, but these rims are broader or lower than those of the preceding type. There are uniformly raised bases, slightly concave beneath, and curving side walls, but the general profiles are more squat and less jug-like than those of Type 36 A. The bases are somewhat thickened in their centers, like those of the 3rd century lamps of Types 95 A and B. There is always a vertical band handle. Two examples preserve pierced lugs on their left sides, like those of Type 25 B. The nozzles are long, flat on top, with small wick-holes at their ends. These are reminiscent of those on late examples of Types 95 A and B. Two lamps have a groove around the upper parts of their bodies, interrupted by the nozzle in front and the handle behind. The groove may be taken as one of the distinguishing characteristics of the type. There is some similarity between these lamps and those of Type 29 B in the nozzle formations, broad proportions, and little collars. It will be noted that the former have curved profiles rather than the sharply angular profiles of the latter. The use of Attic clay and the fairly good Attic black glaze, applied both inside and outside, show that Type 36 B was a local product, made occasionally during the earlier years of the 3rd century after the introduction of Type 36 A in the later years of the 4th century B.c. 488 (L 1359).

Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 21 D and 36 A. This rather individual lamp has a profile similar to, but not exactly like, those of Type 36 B. Its nozzle, however, is like that of 487 of Type 36 A. Its collar is unlike those of either of these types, but resembles a high bevelled rim. The profile and lack of raised base suggest an affinity with Type 21 D, but that type invariably has a horizontal rather than a vertical handle. It is barely possible, however, that 491 is a transitional step between the 5th century Type 21 D and the 4th century Type 36 A. The area of body where a knob might have existed is missing; if one were present it would surely date the lamp later rather than earlier in the 4th century. The Attic clay and flaky black to red glaze, joined with the character of the nozzle, place this lamp fairly close to the time of Type 36 A. 491 (L 4366). Pls. 18, 44. H. 0.026 m.; D. 0.066 m.

Plates 18, 44. Corinth: classified under Types XIV and XV. Late 2nd and early Ist centuries B.C. Dating based on stylistic connections with Type 35 A, and on the finding places. These lamps are distantly related to Types 36 A and B, although a long period of time separates those earlier lamps with collars from these later varieties. The immediate predecessor is Type 35 A, which has an angular body with a deeply depressed top. The depression is now replaced by a simple flat, concave, or even convex top with an added collar around it, vertical or slightly flaring. The collar prevents spilled oil from trickling down the outer walls of the lamp, as did the depressed tops of Type 35 A. Some lamps have small auxiliary drain-holes punched around the filling-holes, within the collars; these are essential when the area around the filling-hole is slightly convex, as on 495. The base is usually raised and slightly concave underneath; an occasional lamp by exception may have a base ring. The angular profile is double-convex, with the upper portion having the major emphasis. The filling-hole is surrounded by a narrow shallow groove. There is always a flat</page><page sequence="124">118 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS vertical band handle. There is normally a solid lug, as on Types 35 A and B, although this is not seen on 495 which has other exceptional features; the lug of 494 has a small hole on its top, but this does not penetrate through the clay. The nozzles may be long and tubular, with oval wick-holes and terminations as on 493, or flattened on top and spreading out in a triangular manner toward a termination that must have been somewhat pointed, with flukes. None of these latter nozzles is preserved in its entirety, but their preserved portions show similarities to the pointed and fluked nozzles of Types 35 A and 37 B. This group of lamps is carefully and neatly made, with several small decorative features in addition to the groove around the filling-hole; another groove frequently occurs around the outside of the collar. Both grooves are sometimes scraped of glaze to show the contrast between the pinkish buff Attic clay and the black glaze which otherwise covers all the lamps completely. Type 37 A seems to have been made during a short period of time; it is allied to Type 35 A stylistically and probably is contemporary. It is unlikely that any lamps of Type 37 A were made after Sulla's invasion, when curved globular profiles became more popular than angular profiles. 492 (L 1300). Pls. 18, 44.

Dating based on stylistic similarities with Type 37 A and on the finding places. These lamps are similar to those of the preceding type, but have globular bodies, some of them</page><page sequence="125">TYPE 37 B 119 of an extraordinary size. They rest either on raised bases, which are slightly concave underneath, or on base-rings; it seems likely that the former may be usual for lamps early within the type, and the latter common on the later examples. The characteristic high flaring collar surrounds a concave or nearly flat top. A groove normally surrounds the filling-hole, as on Type 37 A, and often a circular groove or series of concentric grooves ornaments the upper part of the body, outside the collar. Occasionally there is a groove around the top of the lamp within the periphery of the collar. There is always a broad flat vertical handle. Always present, also, is a lug on the left side of the lamps; this is solid except for the exceptional example on 496 which is pierced. A few of the lugs are long and curved, reflecting the delphiniform lugs of late Hellenistic and early Roman moulded lamps. The nozzles, when preserved, are long and pointed with real or incipient flukes. They often have a sharp ridge on their tops. In some of the very large examples the nozzles are ornamented with parallel grooves and ridges, presenting a reeded effect and reflecting the influence of con- temporary mouldmade lamps, Type 48 A and succeeding types. Indeed the nozzle of 502 was cast in two moulds and added to the wheelmade body. This union of moulded and wheelmade parts is not surprising in view of 501. This is not one lamp but three, a fehlbrand or waster composed of two examples of Type 37 B and one example of Type 48 A, a moulded variety. The three lamps collapsed and stuck together when they were seriously injured in firing. They demonstrate clearly that both wheelmade and moulded lamps were sometimes made in a single shop on the same day. One may presume that this was frequently the case, that the same shop turned out moulded lamps in quantities, while producing a few of the more expensive wheelmade lamps that were desirable because they were less likely to come apart at the seam after a slight shock. An unfamiliar shoulder device is seen on the right sides of the two lamps of Type 37 B contained in 501. This is a raised disc, used ornamentally and as an opposite pendant to the solid lug; the origin for this is to be seen in the contemporary Knidos lamps of Types 40 A and B. Occasionally there is an auxiliary drain hole on the top, near the filling-hole, as on 497. Most lamps, however, have concave tops so that any oil spilled in filling will naturally drain back into the body of the lamp through the filling-hole. The enormous size of several of these lamps would indicate an oil capacity enough for several nozzles, yet most of them had but one. Two of the largest, 502 and 503, are not completely preserved, and may have had one or two additional nozzles. Even with extra nozzles to consume the oil, the reservoirs of these lamps would have contained enough fuel for a long night of illumination with bright lights from thick wicks. There exists the possibility that such behemoths may have been planned for sanctuary use, although no indication of this was suggested by the finding places. They may, on the other hand, have been commissioned shortly after the sack of Athens by arrogant Roman conquerors who felt no compunctions about squandering the captured Athenian oil reserves. The clay of Type 37 B is Attic; in the earlier examples it is the usual pinkish buff but in the later ones a coarser buff fabric, perhaps indicating a different clay bed in the neighborhood of Athens that was utilized after 86 B.C. The lamps frequently show on their floors the heavy swirl of clay, not smoothed down, that was made by the fabricant's finger while turning the lamp on the wheel. Such swirls are frequent on other Athenian lamps of the and and early 1st centuries B.C. The glaze varies from good Attic black to a poor brownish red, sparsely applied. As on preceding types, there exists on some of these lamps the decorative scraping of grooves and tops of collars, to expose the natural color of the clay in contrast to the dark painted areas.</page><page sequence="126">120 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS 496 (L 1853).

There is no lug. The thick fat nozzle has an oval termination and is nearly filled by a large spoon- shaped wick-hole. A thick vertical loop handle, grooved, completes the lamp. The clay is thick, light red or buff, and is probably Attic. The glaze is a poor dark red to brown, carelessly applied inside and out, with a tendency to heavy unglazed patches on the bottom and lower sides. Type 37 C may possibly be as early as the first half of the 2nd century B.C.,?00 but the Knidos lamp, which is Broneer's criterion for this date, lasts well into the 1st century after Christ.1'o Moreover, although neither of the Agora examples was found in closed contexts with quantities of dateable pottery, they were both found in association with sherds certainly of the 1st century after Christ. This type also seems to be closely related stylistically to Types 37 A and B, but to follow rather than precede them. These bulbous lamps with little collars were to become much more popular in Byzantine times, when they were re-introduced from North Africa, as Broneer suggests.'02 504 (L 2357). Pls. 19, 45.

Dating based on the finding place of 512 and 514. This group is represented by only three examples from the Athenian Agora, but they are</page><page sequence="129">TYPE 38 123 found by the hundred at Delos,"o" which may have been their center of manufacture, and in great abundance at other Aegean and African sites.'"' They are not connected morphologically with any of our preceding or succeeding types, except that they have globular bodies which fit in appro- priately between Types 37 and 39; their date also places them conveniently in this vicinity. At Delos they are called 3rd century B.C., by analogy with the Esquiline lamps,'05 but a closer examina- tion of the contexts may show that they were most popular on the island in the 2nd century B.C., as the Agora examples demonstrate. The deeply sunken concave top is a characteristic of many 2nd century Attic types, and would imply that Type 38 is also a product of the same era. All lamps of Type 38 are small and remarkably uniform. There is a high flaring base, deeply concave beneath, somewhat like a flaring ring foot. On this is the globular body, which makes an abrupt change into a deep concavity which is the depressed top; a thin groove encircles the top of the body around the periphery of the top. Normally there is no handle, although two or three out of the several hundred examples at Delos have a thin vertical band handle. There is uniformly a large solid lug on the left side projecting out in a wing-like manner. The nozzle is rounded on top and curves out gracefully to a large oval termination that contains the wick-hole. A character- istic of the type is the overhanging lip at the end of the nozzle. The clay is red, micaceous, and usually hard and thin. It is similar to some varieties of Attic clay used in coarse cooking pots, but since so few of these lamps are found in Attica it is unlikely that they were made here. It is possible that Attic clay was exported to Delos, which lacked good clay beds of its own, for local fabricants to use on the island, or the clay could be from any one of a number of eastern sources. The interiors of the lamps are unglazed. The exteriors are unglazed, also, but a number have a thin dull wash over parts of the exteriors, chiefly the nozzle areas and the upper parts of the sides. It is apparent that the manufacturer held a lamp upside down and quickly dipped the front part of it into a thin wash, in order to prevent, in the finished product, the oil from seeping into the porous nozzle from the wick. This is a cheap and very practical procedure, although the lamps must have exuded considerable oil through their porous bases. 512 (L 3875). Pls. 19, 45. H. 0.040 m.; D. 0.047 m.

This type is in the tradition of handleless lamps with ridges around their filling-holes that began with late examples of Type 95 A and continued on in Type 29 A. This group is the latest manifestation although not a continuation of such characteristics, and at the same time shows affinities with the contemporary Type 37. Type 39 is a small group, but marked by well defined features. The bottom is flat or very slightly raised; the sides are curving and globular. The central filling-hole has a ridge and concentric groove around it. 517 by exception has a collar wrapped around the whole body, extended downward so that the sides appear straight; because of the resulting high ridge around the upper part of its body this lamp is provided with four drain-holes to collect the oil spilled on the convex surfaces around the filling-hole. The floors of all the lamps have the swirl of clay that has been noticed in other lamps of this period. There is normally no handle, although 517 with its added collar has also been given a vertical band handle. The lug also is usually lacking, although 515 has a small solid protuberance that recalls those of Type 29 A. The absence of both handle and lug is characteristic of this class. The nozzles are broad, rather short, rounded on top, and flare out to bluntly pointed ends where there are very large oval wick-holes. The nozzles are often set in crookedly so that their ends are slanting away from a horizontal plane. The clay is a soft Attic pinkish buff; the glaze, which is used all over, both inside and outside, is black to red and inclined to be flaky. These lamps were cheaply and carelessly produced, but never in any quantity. 515 (L 4385). Pls. 19, 45. H. 0.032 m.; D. 0.063 m. Complete except for minor chips. Solid lug.

Plates 20, 45. Corinth: classified under Type XIII. Second half of 2nd century and first quarter of 1st century B.C. These dates limit the very rare use of imported wheelmade Knidos lamps in Athens; this dating is based on the existence of one example in the Musee Alaoui in Tunis, from the Mahdia shipwreck of a vessel that had sailed from Athens shortly after 86 B.c.,"o? and on the finding place of 521. The comparative absence of this type at Corinth (destroyed by Mummius in 146 B.C.) serves also to confirm a date for local Greek use in the second half of the 2nd century B.C. Fully developed Knidos lamps, made on the wheel, may have flourished elsewhere as early as the first half of the 2nd century B.C.,'07 but there is no sure attestation of this type before the second half of the century. The moulded versions do not seem to have become current in Athens until the later years of the 2nd century B.C. (see Type 50 A). Both wheelmade and mouldmade varieties reflect an original metal prototype, as the formation of the handle and the color of the fabric will attest. This type is commonly known as the Knidos type because of the vast quantities found at Knidos by Newton.018 The presence of so many in this location suggests an Asia Minor origin for the type, as does the typical brittle dark gray clay that is decidedly non-Attic. There is always a high raised base and a double-convex profile like that of Types 29 A and B. The upper parts of the sides are ornamented with a two-lobed leaf and a raised circle on each side. These are not moulded but are either cut out of a sheet of leather-hard clay and stuck on, or laid on in a moist, more fluid, clay. There are grooves around the deeply sunken concave top, with a plain central filling-hole. The fundamental body shape is very reminiscent of that of Type 32, which lasted at least until the end of the 3rd century B.C. and is the link between types 29 B and 40 A. It is obvious that the latter type is simply a continuation of a long tradition that emphasizes the double-convex body. Possibly lamps of Type 32 had been exported to Asia Minor localities which in turn developed the refinements which characterize the lamps now under discussion. The future influence of the applied leaves and circles will be great, as they will continue on moulded lamps well into the second quarter of the 1st century after Christ (Type 50 C). The handle is a distinctive feature; it is vertical, made of two adjoining loops of clay springing from a simple attachment on the lower part of the body, and it spreads out in two terminations on the shoulder, near the grooves around the top. The loops are bound together by a double band of clay just below the summit of the handle. Such a handle obviously imitates thin coiled bronze rods which would have been appropriate on a metal lamp. Such double loop handles of clay occur often on kantharoi and jugs that date from the late 4th century into the second half of the 2nd century B.c.'09 106 Catalogue Mus e Alaoui, ler Supplement, Paris, 1907, p. 179, K 708, pl.

TYPE 40 B KNIDOS TYPE; ATTIC IMITATION No. 523. Plates 20, 45. Late 2nd to early 1st centuries B.C. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 37 B and 40 A. At least one Athenian craftsman copied the imported Knidos lamps in local clay with a few touches of his own. The single extant example is generally like the parent type, but has a neat ring foot, curved rather than angular side walls, and a broad flat-topped ridge around the sunken top. The handle arrangement is the same, but with one rather than two horizontal rings binding the double bars of the handle and with a (missing) ornament in front, in place of the second ring. On the right side is an applied flat disc, but without the accompanying leaf of Type 40 A. This disc used alone is comparable to the decoration of 501 of Type 37 B, which also had the effect of a deep concave top, thanks to its high flaring collar. The one preserved example of Type 40 B apparently had more than one nozzle, although the average lamp of this group would presumably have imitated the single nozzle of Type 40 A. The clay is a well worked Attic pinkish buff; there is a swirl of clay left on the floor of the lamp as on so many others of this era, and a fine red to black glaze is used inside and out. 523 (L 2131).

Corinth: classified under Type I. Late years of 5th century to early years of 1st century B.C. Dating based individually on character of clays, glazes, and nozzle formations; only 524 comes from a reliable context. The Agora Excavations have yielded few multiple lamps that were made for sanctuaries, and those that have been found are merely fragments.10o The Acropolis has furnished scores of large corona lamps, like 524; "' the Agora has yielded only this fragment and another that is similar but smaller. The temples dedicated to Hephaistos and Apollo Patroos in the civic center may have been furnished with comparable offerings, but these two are the only sanctuary lamps from the entire Agora area that may be dated as early as the second half of the 5th century B.C.112 A later version, handmade and rectangular, rather than the familiar circle with a row of nozzles along its edges, is 525. Large rectangular tray-shaped lamps appear also on the Acropolis; the Agora example is a late one; the shape of its nozzles suggests the 2nd century B.C. Two of the lamps, 526 and 527, are circular tubes of clay with short nozzles projecting at intervals around the perimeter. They were filled through projecting funnels on the top and gave the effect of enormously enlarged askoi. Such lamps could be moved about with less danger of spilled oil and with less chance of dust or foreign matter getting into the oil reservoirs. The covered bodies as well as the character of the nozzles would serve to date both of these specimens in the late Hellenistic period, during the 2nd century or early years of the 1st century B.C. The final lamp, 528, consists of a circular stand with a series of small individual lamps mounted around its rim. The aggregate resembles an example found in Corinth,"'" but the shape of the component members of the Agora lamps suggests a date much later than that given to the Corinthian prototype. This Agora lamp must certainly fall within the Hellenistic period.'14 The clay of all lamps of Type 41 may be Attic; detailed descriptions of the individual items follow. 524 (L 2646). Pls. 20, 45.

TYPE 42 A MOULDED GLOBULAR BODIES AND THICK BASES Nos. 529-530. Plates 20, 46. Ca. first quarter of 3rd century B.C. Dating based on strong stylistic similarities to 3rd century examples of Type 25 B Prime, and on the finding place of 529. Here begin the earliest known Greek lamps that are moulded rather than handmade or wheelmade.55 Types 42 A through 44 D are undecorated and cover the years from the early 3rd century B.C. into the second quarter of the 1st century after Christ. Type 45 A will begin a very long series of moulded lamps with decorations in relief, starting in the middle years of the 3rd century B.C. Decorated moulded lamps will continue into the latest phases of Roman lamp manufacture. Type 42 A, a very small group, starts a new phase of lychnology, the mass production of cheap lamps that were eventually to drive the wheelmade lamps out of the market after three hundred years of competition side by side. Not only were moulded lamps cheaper to produce, they were usually stronger. The nozzles were not liable to break off, as did the nozzles of so many wheelmade lamps which were added separately. It is true that accidents sometimes caused moulded lamps to split along the horizontal seams, but even if this happened the lower half could be salvaged and used as a saucer-lamp. A few Agora examples show just this use after they were broken laterally. The introduction of moulded lamps in the early years of the 3rd century B.C. agrees happily with the first appearance of moulded Megarian bowls.16 The lamps, however, were made more 115 In the Catalogue henceforth the measurements will include the width rather than the diameter of the lamps, since they were not thrown on the wheel and thus theoretically are not perfect circles. 11e Thompson dates the earliest Athenian Megarian bowls in the first quarter of the 3rd century B.c.; Hesperia,</page><page sequence="136">130 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS simply than the earliest bowls which had a combination of turned surfaces on the inside and moulded imprints on the outside. The lamps were made in two moulds, an upper and a lower, with the horizontal joint between them carefully sealed and smoothed over with wet clay so that, on Type 42 A and other early moulded lamps, it is very difficult to tell that they were made in two pieces. Type 42 A is so carefully made, and so accurate a reproduction of the wheelmade Type 95 B Prime, that one must look inside for the tell-tale finger-prints to make certain that it is not wheelmade. 530 may be called a transitional piece. In this lamp the nozzle was added separately, as in wheelmade lamps, to the body that had been produced in two moulds. 529 had its nozzle made in the upper and lower moulds. Type 42 A has a solid lug at the left side; this was added separately, although later moulded lamps will have this feature cast in one or both moulds. There is no handle, apparently, on this small group, although the rear portions of 530 are not sufficiently preserved to show whether one existed. The profile, shape of body, ridge around filling-hole, and nozzle agree perfectly with the corresponding features of Type 25 B Prime. The clay is Attic; the lamps are covered with good black glaze inside; their exteriors are unglazed but covered with a thin clay slip. 529 (L 3522). Pls. 09, 46. H. 0.036 m.; W. 0.056 m. Intact.

Plates 20, 24, 46. First half of 3rd century B.C. Dating based on close stylistic similarities to Type 99 A and to the shape (but not the clay) of Type 28 B, and to some extent on the finding places. Type 42 B is similar to the preceding type, but its profile is double-convex, with a vestigial angle between the halves rather than a continuous curve. With such a watch-shaped profile, like those of contemporary lagynoi, the type recalls vividly the character of Type 29 A. In other respects also, such as the raised base, ridge and groove around the filling-hole, and nozzle forma- tion, the type agrees with the wheelmade counterpart. It seems reasonable to assume that Type 42 B is a conscious imitation, made in two moulds, of the popular Type 29 A. The profile and body formations are also similar to those of Type 28 B. In the mouldmade lamp, however, the angle between the upper and lower parts of the bodies is not so sharp as on Type 29 A. The nozzle is always produced in the mould, rather than added separately; the small lug on III, 1934, p. 457.

Dating based in part on some stylistic resem- blances to Types 29 A and 42 B and in part on the finding places. It may be noted that a similar nozzle is found on 363 of Type 25 Variants, well dated in the latter part of 3rd century B.c. These easily recognized lamps retain more or less the basic body shape of Type 42 B, with a double-convex profile and a suggestion of an angle between the upper and lower halves. The profile also relates the type to the contemporary wheelmade lamps of Type 29 A. There is always a pronounced raised ridge around the filling-hole, more emphatic here than on the two related types; when the mould was freshly used, there is a suggestion of a groove around this collar-like ridge. The new feature is the casting of the lug in both the upper and lower moulds. The lug now becomes a pointed wing-like projection at one side rather than a little lug on the upper part of the side wall. The lug was pierced after the two parts of the lamp were assembled, but on some lamps the rod or needle used for piercing started through the top of the lug but did not penetrate all the way through to make a hole. A partial penetration is useless for inserting a cord for suspension purposes; it may be considered either a vestigial hole or a little indentation for inserting a needle or stick that could serve at times to poke up the wick. Type 42 C is the earliest of the undecorated moulded types that is equipped with handles. Although some lamps have none, 535 and another inventoried one have simple vertical band handles added after the lamps emerged from the moulds. It is interesting to note that the handleless lamps, however, may have either a pierced lug or (as an uncatalogued example shows) a semi-pierced lug. Apparently there is no correlation between lack of handle and a fully pierced lug. It would seem that in general the pierced lugs were used more for wick-sticks than for suspension purposes; the succeeding group, Type 42 D, tends to corroborate this hypothesis.</page><page sequence="138">132 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS The nozzle is a characteristic feature of this type. It reflects a metal prototype in its tubular rather than angular shank, that swells out and up to a flat oval or circular rim around the wick-hole. It resembles somewhat the up-ended trunk of an elephant, and has been seen once before in a wheelmade clay lamp, 363 of Type 25 Variants. The clay is Attic; the glaze used on both exteriors and interiors is black, flaky, and of a rather inferior quality characteristic of that used generally on Hellenistic lamps, in contrast to the finer black glaze that is common on earlier fabrics.

Plates 20, 46. Second and third quarters of 3rd century B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarities with Types 29 B, 32, and 42 C. This type is similar to the preceding in that the lug is always cast in both moulds and projects as a wing on the lower left side. The lug is usually pierced through, although one uncatalogued example has the partially pierced hole seen on 535 of Type 42 C. The lamps with pierced holes appear with or without broad flat vertical handles added after the lamps were cast. The profiles show a raised base and curving sides, sometimes with a suggestion of double convexity. The filling-hole has a raised ridge around it, which may be narrow as on 536, recalling the similar feature of Type 29 B, or more often broad. and concave, recalling the concave rims of Type 32. There is always a little groove around the ridge, also cast in the mould. The nozzles, unlike those of Type 42 C, follow the normal design seen on most lamps of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.c. They have angular shanks, more or less straight sides, and are flat on top like those of the various Type 25's. Often the start of the nozzle is emphasized by a cast groove at right angles to the nozzle's axis. This line serves to articulate the nozzle and set it off from the body of the lamp, as if it were a separate feature rather than a part of the castings that actually include the body and nozzle together. Attic clay and rather worn poor black glaze are used throughout.</page><page sequence="139">TYPE 43 A 133SS 536 (L 528). Pls. 20, 46. H. 0.030 m.; W. 0.049 m. Intact except for handle; restored.

TYPE 43 A CONCAVE OR RIDGED TOPS; DELPHINIFORM LUGS CAST IN UPPER MOULD Nos. 539-544 (and 21 others inventoried). Plates 20, 46. Second half of 3rd century B.C. Dating based on close stylistic similarities to wheelmade prototypes, Types 31 and 32, and on the finding places. A large group of moulded lamps with enclosed bodies, having various features that emphasize the filling-holes, were made during the second half of the 3rd century B.C. and most of the 2nd century. The first subdivision, Type 43 A, is distinguished by the presence of curving cornucopias or delphiniform lugs, cast in the upper moulds only. These are always solid, rather high on the left sides of the lamps' bodies, and are vestigial remainders of the once useful pierced lugs. A few lamps in this group have a pair of such lugs, one on each side, making a symmetrical decoration of this feature."' This type is made with or without a flattened vertical band handle. The general profile, as well as the arrangement of the top, is like that seen in Types 31 and 32. The curving sides set on a raised base nearly enclose the body. The filling-hole is marked either by conspicuous ridges and grooves or by a narrow concave rim. The nozzles are long, flat on top or nearly so, with small wick-holes at the extreme ends. Several lamps are from the same moulds; 540 is a duplicate of an inventoried but uncatalogued specimen, and 542 also has a counterpart in the Agora inventory. A third set of moulds produced three identical specimens, all in the Agora inventory. An interesting use of wrought iron " is seen in the lamp-holder that encases 542. This is a shallow saucer with a long projection to contain the lamp's nozzle; although it is now badly rusted, sufficient remains to show that it was made in one piece, with a low raised base."' Its use was to prevent the oil from the lamp from seeping onto the table, as well as to increase the lamp's stability. 541 has a protective clay rim or collar added by hand around the upper part of the body. This feature will become common in later Hellenistic and early Roman lamps; its use is to collect oil that might spill onto the sides of the lamp when the reservoir is filled through the rather narrow central opening. At the base of the nozzle there should be a drain-hole, within the collared area, to return the spilled oil to the interior; the lamp is broken away at this point. Type 43 A utilizes Attic clay and rather poor black glaze that is applied to both interiors and exteriors. An occasional example such as 541 may be fired red. 117 Compare 544, with a somewhat earlier wheelmade lamp, 313 of Type 25 B, which has a pair of pierced lugs. 11s Although the metal at first glance appears to be cast, the laminations appearing at the breaks show it to be wrought. Cast iron appears very late; cf. Charles Singer, E. J. Holmyard, A. R. Hall (editors), A History of Technology, Oxford, 1954, vol. I, p. 598. 119 Cf. the similar lead lamp-holder, 346 of Type 25 C Prime.</page><page sequence="140">134 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS 539 (L 3777). Pls. 20, 46. H. 0.030 m.; W. 0.067 m.

TYPE 43 B RAISED EDGES AROUND FLAT TOPS Nos. 545-548 (and 10 others inventoried). Plates 20, 46. Third and fourth quarters of 3rd century B.c., perhaps a little later. Dating based on stylistic similarities to some lamps of Type 33 A, and on the finding places. These neatly made lamps have their nozzles and their lower bodies similar to those of the preceding type, but their tops are distinctive. Here the top is a wide flat circle, anticipating the discus of early Roman lamps, with a raised ridge or band around it which is actually the continu- ation of the tops of the side walls. A thin circular groove, made in the mould, sometimes accom- panies this raised edge. The general effect is that of a flat depressed top sunken below the lamp's walls. This depression is a development of the wide concave rim seen sometimes on the preceding type. A few examples of wheelmade Type 33 A have similar depressed tops, but the production of a flat top is difficult on the wheel, although it is easy to make in the mould and is appropriate for this technique. It is possible that the flat tops of Type 43 B reflect the influence of moulded metal lamps. For the first time in the development of moulded lamps one sees here an articulated design that is essentially suitable for the mould rather than a style that imitates the curving contours produced by the wheel.</page><page sequence="141">TYPE 43 C 135 The craftsmen who produced Type 43 B, perhaps attached to a single shop, followed no set rule as to the lugs. Some lamps have none; some lamps have a lug on their left sides which may be solid, pierced, or semi-pierced like those seen on Type 42 C. The lug is normally added separately, by hand, although that of 549 was apparently cast in the upper mould. The lamps occur both with and without a vertical band handle. There is no fixed relationship between the handle or lack thereof and the lug or lack of lug; there are several combinations, but the most usual one is a handle on a lamp with a pierced lug. This gives further credence to the theory that at least by the later 3rd century B.C. the pierced lug's function was either purely vestigial or else a support for a wick-stick, rather than a means of suspending the lamp when not in use. The nozzles, following traditional patterns, are flat on top, have long nearly straight sides, and have small wick-holes at their extremities. The flat top of the nozzle is sometimes level with the circular flat top of the lamp itself, but occasionally the nozzle's top is level with the ridge and forms a part of it. The latter arrangement is more easily made in a mould than the former design. Several lamps come from the same mould; 546 and 547 are duplicates of three other examples in the Agora inventory. The clay is Attic; the fairly good metallic black glaze used on interiors and exteriors corroborates the feeling that these lamps reflect the influence of moulded bronze prototypes. 545 (L 4369).

Dating based on stylistic affinities with Type 43 B, also on elements that will lead into the development of Type 43 D, and on the finding place of 551. This type is very much like the preceding one, but the contours are less precise. The wide circular top or discus is present, but it is concave rather than flat, and the ridge or rim surrounding the top is less pronounced. In fact 551 and a few other examples have no crisply formed rim at all, merely a curving section between the convexity of the side walls and the concavity of the top. This same feature appears on the numerous examples of the succeeding group, Type 43 D. There</page><page sequence="142">136 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS is the usual raised base. The side walls are slightly curved, but tend to approach the vertical in their general effect, like the nearly straight side walls of Type 43 B. There are, on some examples, thin concentric grooves around the edge of the concave top. These lamps have either a pierced lug or no lug at all; no examples in the Agora inventory have solid or semi-pierced lugs. When they exist the lugs seem to have been added by hand after the two halves of the lamp were joined together. The flat vertical band handle is used on some specimens, absent on others; as on the preceding type, there is no standard arrangement con- cerning the use of the handle with or without the lug, but usually lamps without handles do support pierced lugs. 550 has an unusual strainer, a concave depression pierced with many small holes, in the filling- hole area. This is a feature to be expected in a lamp made from a mould but would be impossible in a wheelmade example. The mould for the upper half of any lamp has a boss which represents the opening for the filling-hole; usually clay is packed around the boss, so that there will be a resultant void in the center of the finished lamp. In this example the wet clay was packed around and over the boss, so that when the lamp was turned out of the mould it had a shallow cup occupying the filling-hole area; while leather-hard it was punched with several tiny holes rather than cut out entirely. Such a strainer might prove useful in sifting out any large bits of foreign matter that might be in the oil. 551 probably had several very small filling-holes punched through its concave top; these result in the entire top of the lamp serving as a kind of strainer. This same specimen has another unusual element, a narrow slot cut through the leather-hard clay of the nozzle's top, for inserting a thin rod to poke up the wick. This lamp is equipped with both a handle and a pierced lug; it is very evident that the wick-stick, with its function facilitated by the cut-out slot, would be kept in the hole of the lug when not in use. The nozzles are of standard form and, like those of the preceding type, may have their flat tops either on a level with the ridge around the top of the lamp or at a lower level corresponding to the mean height of the concave top. The clay is Attic, the glaze sometimes a heavy black metallic coating like that of Type 43 B but more often a worn and mottled black, like that of Type 43 A and especially that of Type 43 D, to follow. 549 (L 4412).

Plates 21, 46. Last quarter of 3rd century B.C. through first half of second century B.c., and perhaps a little later. Dating based on obvious likenesses to wheelmade Types 33 A and 34 A and on the finding places. In profile these lamps resemble and, in general, are the moulded counterparts of Types 33 A and 34 A. Type 43 D cannot be divided into two groups, with curved profiles comparable to Type 33 A, and angular profiles comparable to Type 34 A, because Type 43 D is moulded and the profiles are naturally irregular at the point of junction of the two moulds. There is usually a suggestion of an angular or double-convex profile, because of the physical use of two moulds as well as a desire to emphasize the double convexity of Type 34 A. The proportions of the lamps are broad and spreading, rather than narrow and tall; in this respect they recall Type 43 A, rather than Types 43 B and C, as well as their wheelmade counterparts. The broad concave top or discus is surrounded by a pronounced ridge, sometimes grooved as on Type 43 C, but unlike the crisp ridge of Type 43 B. Such a top is a careless continuation of the concave designs of Type 43 A. There is a simple and sometimes quite small filling-hole, occasionally surrounded by a thin groove, as on 557. Some lamps have vertical band handles, others have none. Sometimes, on lamps equipped with handles, there is lacking the customary lug on the left side. When lugs appear they may be pierced or solid, and both kinds are used on lamps with or without handles. The lugs are made variously, usually handmade but occasionally produced in the upper mould; in one case at least, 559, it was made in both moulds. The nozzles on some of the earlier lamps, made in the 3rd century B.C., are flat on top, but most of the nozzles are curved on top, following the form used on most lamps of the 2nd century B.C. and later. The ends of the nozzles may be curved or slightly blunted, similar to those on the parent types. The moulding process in which the nozzle was shaped in one piece with the body permitted a longer nozzle than is found on the contemporary wheelmade lamp in which the nozzle was made separately and attached. Several fragments of moulds have been discovered. 558 could have served for the upper part of a lamp very much like 557. 561 is a bit of a lower mould, and could have served equally well for lamps of Types 43 B and 43 C as well as for this type. Another fragment of a lower mould is similar, but uncatalogued. The clay is Attic, and a rather poor mottled black glaze is used all over. 554 (L 4550). Pls. 21, 46. H. 0.030 m.; W. 0.066 m.

Dating based on obvious stylistic analogies with late examples of Type 43 D. If only one example of Type 43 D Prime had been found it might have been considered an unfinished example of Type 43 D or a sport. The presence of two unglazed lamps, however, shows that a number were intentionally produced. Type 43 D Prime is exactly like Type 43 D except that the exterior is coated with a thin clay slip rather than black glaze. The nozzles are rounded on top rather than flat, which implies a date in the 2nd rather than in the 3rd century B.c.

Plates 21, 28, 47. 1st century B.C., second quarter to end of century. Dating based on stylistic similarities to decorated moulded lamps of Types 49 A and B and on the finding place of 569 and 571. These lamps of the post-Sullan period continue the tradition of the undecorated mouldmade lamps that will finally disappear in the next century, to yield the market entirely to the more interesting decorated lamps. Type 44 A has a circular flat raised base as a standard feature, the only exception being 570 with a circular base-ring. The bodies tend to be high and globular, with no marked distinction between the lower and upper curves. The tops are broad circles, flat or slightly concave, and set off from the rounded sides by a low circular grooved ridge, recalling the shape of Types 49 A and B. There is always a broad vertical band handle. No lugs are ever seen on this type, nor on any of the other subdivisions of Type 44; this is a significant omission, as a similar absence of lugs will be noted on contemporary decorated moulded lamps, although they had lugs both before and after the 1st century B.C. The nozzle is a distinctive feature of Type 44 A. It is long and pointed, again following the style of the decorated lamps which borrowed the pointed nozzle from 2nd century B.c. imported prototypes (Type 49 A). The top of the nozzle is either angular or else slightly flattened and decorated with several parallel grooves. The lower profile of the nozzle is usually angular also, a feature seen in 1st century B.c. decorated moulded lamps. The clay is Attic, of a fairly good pinkish buff color. The glaze, used both inside and outside, is of a good quality and often fired red, although an occasional peeled black glaze may appear. One lamp bears a signature, the first to be seen on an undecorated moulded lamp, although they were used on ornamented lamps several generations earlier. 572 has Sopatros' name in the genitive, incised in the soft clay of the lamp before it was fired. This is the earliest appearance of this well known Athenian lamp manufacturer who signed many decorated lamps during this period and whose trade-name continued well into the next century. 569 (L 2719).

Plates 21, 47. Ca. 1st century B.C. Dating based on some stylistic similarities to decorated moulded lamps of Type 51 A and on the finding place of 573. This small group of cheaply made lamps presents a minor and perhaps later variation of Type 44 A. The base continues to be raised and flat, but its circular shape is less regular; the circle is pulled out into an oval, nearly into an almond shape, which suggests not only the almond- shaped bases of the imported Type 49 A, but particularly the continuation of this feature in the almond-shaped bases of many moulded decorated lamps of the turn of the era and early years of the 1st century after Christ. The slightly concave top is surrounded by a low ridge, but the ridge is plain rather than grooved as in Type 44 A. There is a rather thin vertical band handle; there is no lug. The nozzle illustrates a temporary return to the simple tubular nozzle with an oval termination seen on most Greek and early Hellenistic lamps. This re'tardataire feature is not so much a conscious revival of an old-fashioned form, nor an influence from contemporary Italian lamps, as it is an economic measure. A rounded nozzle is somewhat easier and cheaper to manufacture, and these lamps are noteworthy for their cheapness in other features. Both the top of the lamp and the nozzle forma- tion suggest comparable features of Type 51 A. The Attic clay is thin and brittle; the glaze is diluted into a thin coarse reddish black wash which is carelessly applied to the upper parts of the lamp with unsightly dribbles here and there on the under side. The interiors are only partially coated with this wash or thin paint. This careless use of a thin wash is seen on scores of decorated lamps of this period, giving a superficial impression of lateness which the finding places belie. Although many very beautiful and costly lamps were made in Athens during the 1st century B.c., and on into the Augustan period, it must not be assumed that there was no demand for cheap little lamps such as these of Types 44 B and C that continued in an old tradition. 573 (L 2194).

The base is circular in these lamps, but in the form of a base-ring, wide or narrow, rather than the customary flat raised base. The wide- plain top is again flat or slightly concave, enclosed within a well defined circular ridge that may be either grooved or plain. The same rather thin vertical handle is used that appeared on Type 44 B.</page><page sequence="148">142 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS Some lamps may be given an added collar to collect spilled oil, and in such cases there are always the requisite drain-holes at the base of the nozzle. The nozzle formation is very wide, circular in section as in the preceding types, but it ends in a neatly made triangular point. This pointed nozzle and the use of the base-ring are the main differences from Type 44 B. The same rather thin and brittle Attic clay of Type 44 B is used and there normally appears the same thin red wash that is carelessly applied to the lower parts of the body. 576 has a more neatly painted coating than the others, covering the entire exterior and interior of the lamp. 574 (L 1369).

Corinth: classified under Type XIX. 1st century after Christ, especially second quarter. These very distinctive examples form the last group in the long Hellenistic tradition of undecorated mouldmade lamps. Plain moulded lamps will continue in Athens during the 1st century after Christ and later, but they will be inspired by Italian prototypes and as such will be considered in a future study devoted only to Roman lamps. Type 44 D depends on earlier Greek prototypes, although made during the Roman period. It is allied closely to and is the development of Type 44 A. The bottoms of the lamps are variable. Normally the base is flat and slightly oval or almond-shaped. Several uncatalogued examples show, however, that occasionally this type employed a flat circular raised base, sometimes embellished with a circular groove within its border. In all other respects the lamps of Type 44 D are remarkably homogeneous. There is a sharp distinction between the convexities of the lower and upper halves of the lamp. There is a wide flat, or nearly flat, circular top with a rather small filling-hole. The top is bordered by a flattened ridge which is on the same plane with the narrow flattened top of the nozzle; this top extends onward and flares out to a bold triangular point around the wick-hole. There is always a narrow vertical ribbon handle, plain or vertically grooved; there are no lugs. The crispness of these lamps</page><page sequence="149">TYPE 45 A 143 is notable; the sharp lines and edges suggest that a metal prototype inspired them. It is possible, indeed, that the softly curving lines of Types 44 A, B and C were galvanized into the sharpness of Type 44 D's profiles by influences from lost metal lamps comparable to those that inspired Type 49 A. The buff or pinkish buff clay is Attic, the glaze in most cases reduced to a thin red to black wash. On a few lamps the wash is carelessly applied, as on Type 44 C, but normally there is an attempt to give a workmanlike even coating to all areas of the exterior and interior. Two of the lamps bear their makers' devices, in each case a broken-barred alpha in relief, made in the mould. It is possible that this letter stands for the name of a fabricant, such as Ariston or Apollonides, who made decorated moulded lamps. An alpha, however, is seen as early as the 2nd century B.c., on lamps of Type 48 B, and is a common mark on many lamps from the early Roman period into the 4th century after Christ. Although its use in some periods may have been to distinguish a fabricant, it is possible that later and continued uses of the alpha simply served as marks denoting prime quality. Another hypothesis might be that later makers simply pirated the mark for their own uses. It is certain, however, that no fabricant whose name begins with alpha can with assurance be identified as the manufacturer of any of these lamps made after the time of Sulla. 577 (L 4883).

TYPE 45 A EARLIEST IMPORTED RELIEF LAMPS Nos. 580-582 (and 2 others inventoried). Plate 47. 3rd century B.C., middle years into third quarter. Dating based on the fact that these are obvious prototypes of Type 45 C, which assuredly flourished before 225 B.c., and on the finding places. At Tarsus these lamps (Tarsus Group IV) occur in the top layer of the Middle Hellenistic Period, i. e., in the later years of the 3rd century B.c. and early years of the 2nd century. These imported specimens introduced into Athens the concept of elaborate moulded decora- tion on lamps,120 although the earliest decoration on a moulded lamp made in Athens appears, in a 120 For this and all succeeding types no profiles are given, as the consistently rounded or double-convex bodies of these moulded lamps remain substantially unchanged throughout the next two hundred years or so. The</page><page sequence="150">144 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS very simple form, on 594 of Type 46 B. Type 45 A, decorated, is a little later than the earliest plain moulded variety, Type 42 A, which developed, however, from local contemporary and earlier wheelmade examples. It seems evident that the great development of decorated moulded Athenian lamps sprang from influences outside this center. Lamps of Type 45 A are the earliest imported prototypes.'21 Other imports will be seen in the lamps loosely associated with Ephesos (Type 49 A) and Knidos (Type 50 A). The origin of Type 45 A presents some doubt. It is possible that Alexandria is the home of the type, or at least had a great deal of influence on the development of decorated moulded bowls.'22 There is a lamp in the Benachi Collection in Alexandria (P1. 55, Benachi 1) which resembles in many ways our 580. Both lamps have the same pitted light gray clay, but it cannot be said definitely that the fabric is Egyptian, although such clay is often found at Hellenistic Egyptian sites. Lamps of Type 45 A are found occasionally at Delos, but here they were brought in as articles of commerce from abroad. Gray wares in general are often associated with the Aeolic regions of northwestern Asia Minor,'23 but our fabrics are more likely to be from the eastern Mediterranean.'24 Whether Alexandria or not, the eastern center that produced Type 45 A started an exceedingly popular fashion that bloomed in Athens, with a subsequent development of approximately three hundred years before the models from Rome established themselves as the prevailing styles. The bodies are low, broad and watch-shaped, with the upper part rising in a low convex curve to the filling-hole that is surrounded by a narrow flat or concave rim, sometimes by a narrow ridge. The bottom is either a flat raised circular base or a shallow broad base-ring. The decorative lugs at the sides are usually, though not always, in pairs; they are invariably solid, whether the form is a conventional scroll or a wing-like projection impressed with a leaf. An occasional lamp such as 580 has a lug of each type, rather than a matched pair which is the norm. There are no handles, and this absence is one of the main morphological differences between Type 45 A and its successors. 580, like the comparable lamp in the Benachi Collection (Pl. 55, Benachi 1), has a third lug or wing-shaped projection at the back, where a handle might be expected. This use of three projections on the perimeter of the body gives a kite-shaped or diamond-shaped effect, especially when the lamp is viewed upside down. Kite-shaped bodies will continue to be popular in eastern Mediterranean centers, evolving into the later " toad lamps " of late Roman periods; they are seldom seen in Athens, however, after Type 45 A.125 The decoration of the tops consists of broad convex petals or gores, with a circle of very small petals overlying them immediately around the rim. The nozzles are usually long and flat, although occasionally tubular, as 581; their tops are always decorated with relief designs. Usually a palmette with scrolled tendrils appears on the tubular nozzles, while the flat nozzles have tapering panels with floral designs. The abundant decoration of these lamps suggests a metal prototype, and one may see a further reminiscence of a bronze ancestor in the double, especially in the triple, lugs. A metal lamp would have been cast in two moulds (as indeed was the case with the present clay examples), but the upper and lower portions would have needed a firmer fastening than the smearing of clay that sufficed for the terracotta specimens. The projecting lugs would designs of the nozzles and tops will be far more important criteria than the profiles of the bodies or the proportions of height to width. 121 Earlier than previously assigned dates: Tarsus, I, p. 89, late 3rd century B.c.; Antioch, IV, p. 17, also late 3rd century B.c.; Walters, p. xxi, mid 2nd century B.C. 122 Priene, pp. 410 ff.; Pagenstecher, Expedition E. von Sieglin, II, 3, pp. 64 ff.; see also Courby, Les vases grecs c~ reliefs, chapter XXIII. 123 J.H.S., LII, 1932, pp. 1 ff. 124 Antioch, IV, p. 60, suggests Seleucia as the home of a somewhat similar clay. 125 Type 47 B, of the later 3rd century B.C., reflects a brief local manifestation of this form.</page><page sequence="151">TYPE 45 B 145 have been appropriate places for rivets in a metal lamp. This is most evident in lamps with three projecting wings, and the tiny leaf designs appearing on these projections on a terracotta lamp in the Benachi Collection in Alexandria (P1. 55, Benachi 2) may indeed be copied from rivet- heads or ornamental devices to conceal the rivets. The clay is coarse, frequently pitted, rather thick, and ranges from light gray to light buff in color. There are traces of very worn, poor black glaze outside and inside on all these lamps. 580 (L 3807). P1.47. H. 0.024 m.; W. 0.061 m.

TYPE 45 B EARLIEST ATHENIAN COPIES OF IMPORTED RELIEF LAMPS No. 583 (and 1 other inventoried). Plate 47. Third quarter of 3rd century B.c. Dating based on the strong resemblance to Type 45 A, which this type frankly copies. These lamps are contemporary Athenian copies of Type 45 A, following the imported variety exemplified in Type 45 A's 581 or the sort of lamp appearing in Plate 55, Benachi 3,126 made of gray clay, presumably from an eastern Mediterranean development of decorated mouldmade lamps, that lasts until the second quarter of the 1st century after Christ, when models from Italy drastically changed the forms. Size, shape and decoration follow closely the imported prototypes. There is a low broad base- ring, enclosing (on these Athenian Type 45 B's) a rosette in relief. The convex top has a narrow ridge around the filling-hole. The lamps of our two examples have a pair of scrolled lugs; neither, however, has a third lug or wing, at the back. The lugs are cast in both upper and lower moulds, infringing little if at all on the convex tops; adaptations of Type 45 B (Type 45 C) have the lugs higher on the bodies of the lamps. 583 has no handle, following the foreign prototypes; other uncatalogued examples show remains of wide vertical loop handles (none is preserved intact). The nozzle is rather wide and tubular, but with a small flattened triangular area spreading down 126 This lamp, found at Hadra, is now in the Benachi Collection in Alexandria. Similar lamps occur at Delos.</page><page sequence="152">146 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS to the small circular wick-hole. The moulded decoration is uniform; on the upper part of the nozzle is a curved-leaf palmette; on the top, broad convex petals with a small ring of miniature flattened petals around the filling-hole and its surrounding ridge; at the junction of the nozzle and the body, a narrow strip, either side of the nozzle, decorated with a herringbone or cable pattern. These little lamps of Attic clay, with rather worn black to brown glaze inside and out, were possibly the product of a single shop, made over a short span of time. The Athenian fabricants were not content merely to copy; very soon in the third quarter of the 3rd century B.c. the local shops started turning out the fanciful and original variations that will be seen in the succeeding types. 583 (L 4578).

TYPE 45 C LOCAL ATHENIAN VARIATIONS OF IMPORTED RELIEF LAMPS Nos. 584-588 (and 20 others inventoried). Plate 47. Later 3rd century B.C., from about the middle of third quarter through the rest of century, perhaps into earliest years of 2nd century B.C. The lamps of this group are local variations of Type 45 A, in contrast to the Athenian copies which form Type 45 B. These locally developed examples are larger than their modest pre- decessors, with certain clearly defined characteristics, particularly the use of lugs in pairs and decorated nozzles. The base is always circular, slightly raised, but with a pronounced concavity within, which gives the effect of a ring foot. No decoration graces the base nor the lower parts of the sides. The lugs appear on each side of the lamp, boldly modelled, and usually made in the upper mould only, for decorative purposes, so that they are fairly high on the lamp's top. 585 and 586, however, retain the earlier custom of having the lugs made in both the upper and lower moulds, with con- siderable lateral projection in a wing-like manner. The normal lugs are ornamental S-shaped scrolls, but on 586 is seen an unmatched pair, a shell on one side and a pierced astragal on the other. A pierced lug is seldom seen on lamps of Type 45 C; the hole recalls the long tradition of pierced lugs on 4th and 3rd century B.c. wheelmade Athenian lamps. It is interesting to see it appear here, used in an Athenian way, on a lug or projection that recalled quite a different function on the foreign prototype. This lamp with the pierced lug is one of the few examples of Type 45 C without a handle, which suggests that the hole may indeed have been for suspension. In the use of lugs, then, one sees in this type reminiscences both of the useful pierced lug and of the pro- jecting pairs of lugs that served as rivet attachments in a metal prototype, as well as a purely decorative use of the lugs. Around the filling-hole is always a broad rim, flat or slightly concave, that forms another distinguishing feature of the type. Some lamps are handleless, as 584; others have a broad vertical band handle, a serviceable Athenian addition. The nozzle is broad, rounded on top, and tapers down to an oval termination and an irregularly oval wick-hole. The tops of the nozzles bear relief decorations, usually a curved-leafed palmette, sometimes a variation which is like a double palmette or thunderbolt, and occasionally a female bust with long wavy hair at the sides of the</page><page sequence="153">TYPE 46 A 147 head. The top of the lamp is decorated sometimes like the preceding types, with a design of broad rays, less skillfully made than formerly, with a circle of small leaves, now degenerated into dots or ovules, around the inner rim. Another decoration, seen on 587, consists of a wavy garland of ivy leaves. Both of these designs will have a long life, especially the former, appearing again and again in various slight variations until well into the 1st century after Christ. Broad rays or petals are seen frequently on Megarian bowls over a similarly long period; the ivy-leaf design is less common on moulded pottery, but often is used as a painted decoration, in thinned clay, around the interiors or exteriors of West Slope ware 127 of this period. It would seem reasonable to see the strong influence of Athenian potters in this first original type of local lamp that combines relief decoration and a mouldmade fabric. The clay of all lamps of Type 45 C is the pleasant thick pinkish buff characteristic of locally produced pottery of this era. Fairly good black glaze, sometimes misfired to a reddish brown, covers the exteriors and interiors with a thick coating. 584 (L 1846). Pl. 47. H. 0.037 m.; W. 0.083 m. Complete.

Dating based on stylistic similarity to undecorated body shapes of Types 42 B and C, and on the finding places. All subdivisions of Type 46 represent a return to body designs seen contemporaneously in undecorated moulded lamps of Types 42 and 43, with moulded decorations derived from Types 45 B and C. 127 A good example is illustrated in Hesperia, III, 1934, p. 321, no. A 38, fig. 6.</page><page sequence="154">148 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS Type 46 A is the decorated counterpart of Types 42 B and C. The body is fairly broad and high, double-convex, and rests on the same sort of concave base seen in the preceding type, 45 C. The filling-hole is large, surrounded by a narrow raised ridge, which is a distinctive characteristic of this type and serves to help differentiate it from the other categories of Type 46. Another characteristic of Type 46 A is the presence of a single pierced lug, made in both upper and lower moulds, and projecting prominently in a wing-shaped manner on the left side. This variety of lug is not at all related to the version seen on imported lamps and their adaptations; it is Athenian, and a descendant of the useful pierced lug of 4th century varieties. Only on 592 is the lug more constrained and in harmony with the purely decorative lugs seen on Type 45 C. The nozzle is long, flat on top, with an oval termination; its top is usually plain, but it may occasionally have a relief rosette at its base, as on 591. About half the lamps of this group have broad vertical band handles; the remainder are handleless. Most of these above-mentioned characteristics are also typical of Types 42 B and C. The moulded decorations on the tops of these lamps of Type 46 A echo those of Type 45 C. One sees long broad rays, with a ring of small petals around the filling-hole, as on 589. Another characteristic decoration, seen on 590, is a design of broad leaves with small diamonds between them, springing from a narrow circle of ovules or smaller leaves, the whole giving an imbricated effect. This pattern, similar to contemporary Megarian bowl designs,'28 is a prototype for the elaborate imbricated designs that will be popular on moulded lamps in the late Hellenistic, early Roman era. 593 has a somewhat similar pattern of overlapping triangles. The clay and glaze are like those of Type 45 C; Attic clay, with black glaze inside and out varying in quality and sometimes in purity of the black. 589 (L 1855). P1.47. H. 0.041 m.; W. 0.072 m.

Middle of second quarter of 3rd century B.C., and through its third quarter. Dating based on the stylistic similarity to undecorated body shapes of Type 42 D and on the finding places. This type is comparable to Type 42 D in body and shape, and like Type 46 A in its varieties of moulded decoration as well as a few other features. The same circular concave base of these prototypes appears here, together with a wide high body. A distinguishing feature is the broad raised band, sometimes slightly concave, that surrounds the filling-hole in the manner of Type 45 C. There is always a prominent wing-shaped lug on the left side, made in both upper and lower moulds; this is customarily pierced, although 598 has a solid lug and indeed a somewhat less prominent projection. The nozzles are long and flat with neat oval ends; they are sometimes plain, sometimes given a decoration in relief of a rosette or palmette. An occasional nozzle (596) has a design which is a flat triangle between tapering grooves. This is both reminiscent of some foreign lamps of Type 45 A and prophetic of the characteristic late 2nd century B.C. nozzle decoration of grooves or ridges. The lamps may or may not have plain vertical band handles. The moulded decoration on the upper half of the body varies. There may be very little, as on 594; here there are several rosettes used sparingly; this lamp is early within the type, and the decoration is not the sort seen on imported moulded lamps or their successors. This lamp is merely a timidly decorated example of Type 42 D; it is perhaps the oldest moulded decorated lamp in the history of lamp-making, and slightly antedates the imported examples of Type 45 A. Decoration on other lamps of Type 46 B recalls the trend that was being established about this time by the foreign imports. There are broad rays with the smaller circlet of leaves, as on 595, and the rays without the leaves, as on 596. One sees also the design made up of large broad leaves, which also appears on Type 45 A; this may be plain as on 597 or with intermediate and triangular leaves, as on 598. Attic clay is the fabric, of course, and the glaze used both inside and outside is usually a thick black, sometimes misfired to red or brown. Despite the use of glaze, lamps sometimes tend to exude oil, and perhaps to avoid stains, as well as to catch oil that might spill when the lamp was being filled, an iron lamp-holder was devised for 596. This recalls the similar iron holder for 542 of Type 43 A, and is of approximately the same date; they mark the beginning of a development that will be characteristic of thousands of later Hellenistic and early Roman lamps: the use of an enveloping clay collar that surrounds the entire body and nozzle of the lamp and serves to catch oil that spills in filling the lamp, as well as oil that oozes from the nozzle. 594 (L 3183).

Corinth: classified under Type XVIII. 3rd century B.c., third into fourth quarters. Dating based on the stylistic similarity to undecorated bodies of Type 43 A and on the finding places. These lamps are the decorated equivalents of the plain moulded Type 43 A. The bases are raised, slightly concave beneath, and sometimes give the effect of a base-ring. The body is either rounded or watch-shaped; the top is always pronouncedly convex with a narrow ridge and groove around the filling-hole. The solid lug, cast in the upper mould only, is inconspicuous because it tends to merge with the decoration in contrast to the very prominent lugs of contemporary lamps of Types 46 A and B. A single example, uncatalogued, has a hole pierced in the top of the lug but it does not penetrate through. Most of these lamps are handleless, allowing the decoration of the tops to appear untrammelled; two uncatalogued specimens, however, preserve traces of simple vertical handles like those of preceding types. The nozzles are long, rather flat on top, with small oval wick-holes. The top of the nozzle is invariably decorated, usually with the familiar rosette or thunderbolt (similar to a double palmette); sometimes there is a female head in relief, reminiscent of the heads on lamps of Type 45 C, undoubtedly the prototype. The decoration on the top of the body shows various motifs, but not the ray nor broad leaf patterns so familiar on preceding types. One sees here various patterns concerned with wreaths or garlands, the two most popular being a bold</page><page sequence="157">TYPE 46 D 151 wreath of large vine leaves and a garland of leaves and berries tied in a knot at the back of the lamps. 603 has a circle of sportive dolphins 129 and on 604 is a circle of long ovules. The lamps were made locally of Attic clay; black glaze of a fairly good quality occurs both inside and outside. A mould, 601, is for a lamp similar to 600, possibly for this very lamp. The finding of this mould and another, 605, attests to local workmanship, although in some cases (not these) the original lamp or matrix from which the mould was made could have been imported. 600 (L 772).

Third and fourth quarters of 3rd century B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarity to Type 43 B and on the finding places. These lamps are the decorated counterparts of the plain moulded Type 43 B. From a low raised base, sometimes slightly concave beneath, the body of the lamp spreads out and then rises in nearly straight walls to the top. The top is flat or nearly so, and slightly sunken below the tops of the walls so that there is the effect of a narrow ridge around it. The nozzles are long and flat on top with nearly straight sides. The wick-holes are small, rounded or oval. The flat top of the nozzle is level with the top of the ridge around the sunken top or discus.

As on lamps of Type 43 B, the lug seems to have been added by hand rather than cast in the top mould. None of our lamps that preserves its rear portion has a handle. The top of the nozzle may or may not be decorated with a double palmette or thunderbolt. The sunken discus or top is decorated with small figures in relief, motifs comparable to those on Megarian bowls of this period. The bearded satyr masks on 607 offer a particularly close parallel to those on the bowls.1O0 Other patterns are less interesting, and include the now familiar rosettes seen on 606.

TYPE 46 E TRADITIONAL BODY DESIGN, DECORATED SIDES SURROUNDING CONCAVE TOP Nos. 609-610 (and 2 others inventoried). Plate 48. Late third quarter and into last quarter of 3rd century B.C. Dating based on stylistic simi- larities to Types 43 C and D, and on the fact that Type 46 E seems to be a transitional group from Type 46 D to Type 48 A. Finding places show only that Type 46 E occurs before ca. 150 B.c. These lamps, like those of Type 46 D and their predecessors, have slightly raised concave bases, although a single example, 609, has a proper neatly made base-ring. The high curved walls rise to join noticeably broad concave tops; these concave tops are reminiscent of Type 46 D; they recall the tops of Types 43 C and D, but are here decorated. The moulded decorations are confined to the upper parts of the side walls. Sometimes a pronounced ridge surrounds the top or discus, as on 609; otherwise there is no transitional member between the concave walls and the convexity of the top. A solid lug appears on some, not all, cast in the upper mould only and high on the body. There may or may not be a vertical band handle; the fact that one of our lamps has a handle but no lug and the other a lug but no handle does not signify that they are mutually exclusive; an uncatalogued fragment preserves bits of both handle and solid lug. The tops of the long flat nozzles are decorated with the familiar motifs of rosette or thunder- 1-0 See Hesperia, III, 1934, pp. 356 if. Masks the same as those on this lamp appear on six Megarian bowls (nos. C 22, C 3, C .6, C 87, C 46 and D 49), five of which may be confidently dated in the later years of the 3rd century B.c.

The upper parts of the bodies have patterns of ribbing or broad rays. These derive from the slightly earlier patterns of Types 45 B and C and will continue with monotonous repetition and degeneration not only through the 2nd and 1st centuries B.c., but well on into the 1st century after Christ.

TYPES 47 A-C DECORATED LAMPS OF UNUSUAL SHAPES, MID-THIRD TO MID-SECOND CENTURIES B.C. TYPE 47 A COLUMNAR LAMPS Nos. 611-612 (and 3 others inventoried). Plate 48. Corinth: compare Type IX. Mid 3rd century B.C., through third quarter. Dating based on the close stylistic similarity of 611 to Type 46 B. These columnar lamps have standards exactly similar in design. Only one preserves its lamp on top, and this happens to be a specimen very close to Type 46 B; the lamps on the other standards could well have been of other types. Type 47 A is based on the column design, rather than the lamp form. The preserved lamp exhibits all the conventional features of Type 46 B including a bit of the lug. This would serve to confirm further the supposition that the pierced lug was frequently used as a resting place for a small stick or probe useful in adjusting the wick of the lamp. A pierced lug would hardly be used for suspending a lamp of this sort, equipped with its own substantial support. The decoration of the preserved lamp is not seen on other examples, either in Type 46 B or in any other Hellenistic type: alternating wreaths and narrow pear-shaped pendants. The lamps themselves, made in two moulds, were attached before firing to the tops of the standards, likewise made in two moulds, but longitudinally: a smaller mould for the decorated front portion of shaft and capital, and a somewhat larger deeper mould for the plain rear of the vertical standard. The hollow column shows a marked diminution from bottom to top; none of our examples preserves the bottom of its flaring base. On the front the shaft is decorated with shallow flutes topped by two horizontal bars. Above these is the Corinthoid capital, with a transverse band of alternating leaves and pear-shaped lobes at its base, from which spring, at either end, simple acanthus volutes. Between the volutes is a simply modelled face with wings at</page><page sequence="160">154 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS the top of the head; no hair is indicated. The figure may possibly be Hermes or more likely a winged gorgoneion; it is difficult to cite an architectural precedent for this."' Although the shaft is circular, the capital is roughly triangular in section with only one decorated face, above the fluting of the shaft. One lamp shaft, 612, is somewhat smaller than the others and has a reduced number of flutes although it is normal in all other particulars, and need not differ in date. These standard lamps may well have been occasionally dedicated in sanctuaries,'82 but there is nothing that precludes their use in a private household. One sees in these simple terracotta columns a reflection of the bronze or possibly silver prototypes which were the lost ancestors (related to the famous golden lamp of Kallimachos in the Erechtheion) of the late Greek marble and bronze lamp standards that stood by themselves on the floor, and which were so highly prized by early Roman conquerors such as Sulla.'3" These small clay columns are too fragile to be practical and long-lived; they would be more appropriate in metal."84 The clay is Attic; the glaze black to red, used all over except for the inside of the shaft and a distinctive reserved band around the middle of its outer surface. This reserved band occurs without exception on all the Agora examples. A few trickles of glaze on the inside of the lower part of the shaft of 611 show that the base of the column was open underneath. 611 (L 140). Pl. 48. H. (of lamp only) 0.033 m.; W.

TYPE 47 B ATHENIAN KITE-SHAPED LAMPS Nos. 613-614. Plate 48. 3rd century B.c., third into fourth quarters. Dating based on stylistic similarity to Types 45 A (imported) and 46 C (Athenian) and on the finding place of 614. These lamps are closely related to Type 46 C. There is the same raised base, concave beneath, a somewhat similar broad tall body, the same small filling-hole with a slight ridge around it, and the same oval wick-hole. The major difference lies in the shape of the body, which is roughly kite-shaped, with a blunted point at the back and one on either side. This shape is fairly common 181 Cf. the capitals from portals of the " Tufa Period " in Pompeii, e. g. A. Maiuri, Pompeii, 7th ed., 1954, p. 100, figs. 68, 69.

Examples from Alexandria exist in the Benachi Collection (P1. 55, Benachi 4); others in the British Museum were found in Cyprus, Egypt and South Russia.'" Our lamp, 580 of Type 45 A, an import, approximates this shape. The kite-shaped body is the natural result of an evolution developing from the lugs at the sides. A pair of small solid projecting lugs may be seen on 580 as well as on the comparable Benachi lamp (P1. 55, Benachi 1) . These lamps have an additional third lug at the back, in place of a handle, suggesting rivet-covers on a metal prototype. The design of the terracotta lamp, with three lugs and the nozzle forming four distinctive points, then becomes regularized into a tetragon, and the resulting kite-shaped form appears clearly on the Benachi lamp. The final stage, with no indication of lugs whatsoever, is our rare Attic version, Type 47 B. These lamps may or may not have a vertical band handle at the back, added separately and obliterating part of the design. The decoration of Type 47 B is uniform on both of our specimens; the nozzle has a large thunderbolt that extends up to the filling-hole, as seen occasionally on Type 46 C. The remainder of the lamp has a pair of striding satyrs, arms stretched out, one on either side of the filling-hole, their heads toward the nozzle; the area around the satyrs is filled with a tendril pattern. Normally when a pair of figures appears on a lamp they have their feet toward the nozzle, as on the Benachi lamp. Our Attic lamp-makers considered the glance of the person holding the lamps, who sees the satyrs right-side up, rather than the view of the lamp by an observer facing the lamp. The satyrs on lamps of Type 47 B have close affinities with similar figures on Megarian bowls 36 made in Athens. The clay and all-over black glaze of 613 is certainly Attic. The other example has a heavier fabric generally fired gray and a thicker black glaze; there is no reason to insist upon this being non-Attic, however. The two lamps are of slightly different dimensions and cannot be from the same moulds, although the designs are identical save for a thin groove around the filling-hole of 613 that does not appear on the other. 613 (L 1577).

TYPE 47 C PLASTIC LAMPS Nos. 615-619 (and 3 others inventoried) . Plate 48. Late 3rd through late 2nd century B.c. Dating based on some stylistic similarities to Types 46 B, 46 C, 47 B, 50 A and 51 A. Some finding places are also helpful. In the Agora excavations a very small number of plastic lamps has been found that may be dated in the Hellenistic and early Roman eras. All in this group are assignable to the period 1-S Walters, pp. 42, 43, 46, nos. 302, 311, 324. 1-6 Hesperia, III, 1934, pp. 357-358, nos. C 23-24, figs. 41, 42. The satyrs appearing on these two Megarian bowls are exactly like those on the lamps. The bowls are from a deposit dated in the late 3rd century B.c. to ca. 200 B.c. This agrees well with our independent dating of the lamps.</page><page sequence="162">156 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS before Sulla; there is none that can assuredly be dated after 86 B.c.; the next group of plastic lamps are Roman imports of the later 1st century after Christ.'37 The dearth of plastic lamps in the 1st century B.C. is paralleled by a similar paucity of terracotta figurines. The coroplast and the plastic lamp fabricant were closely allied, very often perhaps the same person. One sees in the scarcity of decorative moulded objects during this period a reflection of the general depression that characterized many aspects of Athenian economy in the long lean years between Sulla and Augustus. The ordinary mouldmade lamps of these decades showed a comparable poverty. Many were needed, of course, but they were cheaply made and had little to offer in the way of vigorous new designs. There are several different varieties within Type 47 C; some lamps are anthropomorphic, some zoomorphic; all except one, 616, are mouldmade; all can be of local Attic clay. The production of this group stretched over a century but one may assign an early date, ca. late 3rd century B.c. (to early 2nd century?), to 615 and 618, and place 617 and 619 later in the 2nd century B.C. The reasons for these assignments appear below. Two of the earlier plastic lamps are in the shape of finely modelled negroes' heads. 615 is perhaps the oldest extant example of this kind of lamp which enjoyed a huge popularity in Roman times.'s" This lamp is cast in two moulds, an upper and a lower, with a short flat moulded nozzle taking the place of the mouth and lower lip. It is this nozzle, comparable to those seen on Types 46 B and C, that gives a clue to the date. Remains of a pierced lug on the negro's left cheek also recall Type 46 B, the latest type to make an important use of this feature. With such a nozzle and lug one can safely give this lamp a date in the later years of the 3rd century B.c., possibly as early as the late third quarter of that century. This lamp, equipped originally with a handle, would have utilized its pierced lug only as a resting place for the wick-probe. A somewhat similar negro's head is seen in 616, but this was made by hand, not in a mould, by an artisan more accustomed to creating figurines than lamps. The fabric is built up thickly, with obvious marks of hand-smoothing on the face and textured hand-tooling on the hair. There is no proper nozzle; the parted lips served as a hole for the wick. Pierced holes for earrings (or for wick-probes?) give a touch of realism to this skilfully modelled head. One might think this had been constructed as a matrix for a mould, were it not for the fact that the interior is hollow, and signs of burning on the upper lip show that it was indeed used as a lamp. An early bull's head lamp, 617, is a late Hellenistic prototype for the vast number of comparable heads produced in early and late Roman periods."89 This magnificently modelled specimen, certainly copying a metal prototype, has a double coiled and knotted handle which is like those seen on Type 50 A (the Knidos type), also derived from metal prototypes and starting in the 2nd century B.C. This detail, in addition to the finding place, suggests but does not con- clusively demonstrate that the lamp was produced sometime during the second half of the 2nd century B.C. The lamp is made in two moulds, upper and lower, but with the joints on the outside skilfully smoothed. The tasselled garland that the bull wears is similar to the tassels of an anthropomorphic lamp in this type, 618. The other plastic lamps in Type 47 C are not three-dimensional but rather flat lamps with human heads in high relief forming their chief decoration. 618 and another inventoried example (L 1091) are long, narrow, and flat with small flat circular raised bases. The upper part of each lamp is moulded with a bearded face, filletted and garlanded, of Dionysos or Silenos; the two 137 Miss Claireve Grandjouan is preparing an exhaustive study of the Roman plastic lamps from the Agora, to appear in the volume of the Agora series on Roman lamps. 1s8 For the negro in antiquity see Beardsley, The Negro in Greek and Roman Civilization, Baltimore, 1929. For a short bibliography of the negro head on Greek and early Roman lamps, see notes below under 615. 139 For a bibliography of comparable and later bull's head lamps, see 617 below.</page><page sequence="163">TYPE 47 C 157 fringed ends of the fillet hang straight down on either side of the face. The same head appears, called Pan-Silenos, on a Roman coin of ca. 89 B.C.'40 This gives a clue to the date of our lamps, since both coin and lamps echo the same lost original sculpture that must be anterior to this date. The circlet of leaves or ovules around the filling-hole of the lamp recalls similar uses on lamps of Type 46 B, and the narrow raised ridge of the filling-hole resembles those of Type 47 B. It would seem reasonable to place the lamp, then, in the 2nd century B.C., possibly very early in this century or late in the 3rd when such mannerisms were usual. This lamp has no lugs; the nozzle is not preserved of either example, but it starts as a tubular extension. 619 has a curious almond shape, with an elongated almond-shaped base with a rosette in relief.'" Here the top is taken up by a draped bust of Artemis or Hekate with two flaring torches behind her shoulders. This lamp also is without lugs but the nozzle formation is blunt rather than oval, and recalls the nozzles appearing on lamps of Type 51 A, dated late in the 2nd century B.c. This lamp, like the preceding one, has the human face as the main center of interest on the top; the filling-hole is of minor importance and placed at the back of the composition. In this there is considerable difference from lamps of Type 45 C, which may have female heads, but placed as secondary decorative items on the nozzles of conventionally formed lamps. Another comparable lamp exists in the Agora inventory (L 3295), with the top missing, but indications of a similar moulded bust; its base has a grape design in relief rather than a rosette. 615 (L 4614).

Plates 24, 48. Corinth: classified under Type XVIII. Late third quarter of 3rd century into last quarter of 2nd century B.C. This very large group of Athenian lamps flourished for more than a century with no appreci- able changes in shape or decoration. 620 and 623 are at least a hundred years apart, from excellently dated contexts, yet they show practically no differences. This is the standard type of 2nd century B.C. decorated lamp, a development of earlier 3rd century prototypes, that continued monotonously until new importations from the east in the latter part of the 2nd century B.C. enlivened the local designs. There is always a broad low base, concave beneath, with occasionally the effect of a base- ring. The body is double-convex, usually broad and spreading but sometimes rather narrow in a few very small examples. The nozzle is the characteristic feature of the type, long with an oval termination; it invariably has a pair of lines down its rounded top. These lines are usually grooves, but in a few specimens (such as 628) where the lines were incised in the mould they stand out as ridges. The lines may be roughly parallel or slightly flaring, and they enclose a long narrow strip down the top of the nozzle that is flat or nearly flat. One sees here the degeneration of the flat-topped nozzle that was characteristic of earlier 3rd century Types 46 A and B. The pair of narrow parallel lines will develop later, during the 1st century after Christ, into a long channel that connects the top with the wick-hole, as 741 of Type 52 F. The filling-holes are comparatively small, always surrounded by a ridge, or a narrow concave band, or a groove, or a concentric combination of these features. There is almost always a single lug cast in the upper mould only, on the left-hand side; this is cornucopia-shaped or delphiniform; 627 alone has none; with a few exceptions these lugs are solid. The pierced lug occurs on only two of the Agora lamps; one of these, 620, can be dated very early within the type. There is usually, but not inevitably, a broad vertical ring handle. An occasional lamp is given a high vertical collar, made separately by hand and added to the lamp before firing. This corresponds to the collars or rims on contemporary lamps of Types 33 A and 43 A. Lamps with such devices to catch and drain the spilled oil have small drain-holes at the junction of the collar and the decorated top; 624 is such an example. The decorated tops normally have designs of rays or ridges, sometimes with an additional circlet of dots around the filling-hole as on 628; this latter feature recalls the circlets of leaves or</page><page sequence="165">TYPE 48 A 159 ovules seen on Type 46 A. Occasionally other patterns are seen, as on 629, which has a design of large oval ribbed leaves between pairs of ridges, a Megarian bowl pattern.142 This illustrates again the close link between the lamp-maker and the potter. The clay of these lamps is Attic; they are glazed all over with poor black glaze, usually worn or fired red to brown. A few lamps, such as 624 and 625, have the glaze scraped from the ridge or groove around the filling-hole. This gives a pleasant pinkish buff accent in contrast to the black glaze; the same practice is seen on contemporary lamps of Types 34 A and B. The presence of seven fragmentary moulds attests to the manufacture of these lamps on the fringes of the market place. A unique object is 630, a matrix from which a mould was made; this clay prototype was made on the wheel, a solid tubular handmade nozzle added and the decorative rays carefully scratched in the wet clay before firing. That this is a matrix and not an unglazed lamp is proved by the fact that the nozzle has never been pierced. One lamp bears on its bottom three letters in relief that had been scratched into the mould. These letters are the reverse impressions of the mould's XAI, and represent, probably, the earliest Hellenistic lamp-maker's signature. Such signatures will be common only after the last quarter of the 2nd century B.c. There are scores of Greek names beginning with X AI. No lamp-maker is represented in this or other collections with a name beginning with these three letters, so no likely candidate appears who might be credited with this lamp as well as his later examples. An Athenian potter is known by the name of XAIPEITPATO1, 14 and possibly it was this potter, turning out occasional lamps as a side line, who signed the mould that produced this lamp. We have already seen the close union between the makers of pots and lamps; perhaps this example may show that they were often the same people and that the fabricants who made only lamps were rather in the minority. 620 (L 1926).

Plates 25, 48. Second half of 2nd century B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 48 A and on the finding place of 637. This small group of lamps may properly be regarded as a sub-type within Type 48 A, rather than a separate development. There are many similarities between the two types, seen in the broad spreading double-convex bodies, the large filling-holes surrounded by ridges or narrow bands, and the broad vertical strap handles. Type 48 B, however, has its own peculiarities. There is always a ring foot, within which is a broken-barred alpha in high relief. This letter appears as the first definite instance of a maker's monogram; it may possibly stand for the lamp manufacturer who during this period signed lamps with AAE (see 641 of Type 48 C), or, more probably, for Apollonides, Ariston, or Aineos/-as, whose full names will appear on lamps of the 1st century B.c. The shape of the nozzle, roughly oval at the end, recalls the nozzles of Type 48 A, but here it is rounded on top without grooved lines or ridges. There may be one or two lugs, made in the upper mould only. When a single lug is used it is cornucopia-shaped, but 635 has a pair of S-shaped lugs that recall those of Type 45 C. The lugs are invariably solid. The decoration on all the Agora specimens is uniform: a curved-leaf palmette in relief (recalling that of Type 45 C) on the nozzle and broad rays on the top; there is also a small ring of ovules or dots around the filling-hole, recalling the decoration of 628, of Type 48 A, as well as such decorative features on earlier Types 45 A, B and C. The continuation of 3rd century B.c. features on a 2nd century type shows again the conservatism of the lamp-makers during the middle and later years of the 2nd century B.C. before the importation of fresh new designs from abroad at the end of the century. The clay and the black to reddish glaze that covers the lamps inside and out point assuredly to a local Athenian origin for Type 48 B. 635 (L 1910). Pls. 25, 48. H. 0.031 m.; W. 0.069 m. Intact.

Plates 25, 26, 48. Corinth: classified under Type XVIII. Third and fourth quarters of 2nd century B.c. Dating based on stylistic similarities with Types 35 A and 48 A, as well as on the finding place of 640. The lamps in this type are somewhat diverse in details of construction and decoration, but they have similarities that establish them as a distinct variety of Type 48 A. They form a sub- division, as lamps of Type 48 B, rather than a development. A flat raised base is normal, although 640 has a base-ring which is like a raised base unusually depressed or concave in its center. The walls are comparatively high, with usually a rather pronounced division between the two convex areas. The top is the dominant and characteristic feature here, being wide, devoid of decoration, and flat or slightly concave. The absence of little grooves or ridges around the filling-hole separates these lamps definitively from Types 48 A and B. There may or may not be a lug on the left side; when it exists it is made in the upper mould and is normally solid, although 639 has a pierced lug. 642 has a pair of large leaves in place of lugs, recalling the large shell seen on 586 of Type 45 C. There is usually a broad vertical band handle. The nozzles are long and may be curved on top or flattened; they presumably had oval or blunted terminations. No lamp preserves intact the end of its nozzle, but the extant portions always suggest that the ends were not pointed or fluked in the manner of early 1st century B.C. lamps. The basic shape in general is the moulded and decorated counterpart of Type 35 A. The decoration is varied but always appears on the shoulder of the lamp, i. e., the upper part of the body, as an important feature. The nozzle, too, carries moulded decorations on its top and sometimes on its sides, as on 642, where there are raised volutes outlining the sides of the flat- topped nozzle. The patterns on the shoulders include the familiar ray or tongue pattern seen on contemporary lamps of Types 48 A and B; also seen is a pattern of ovules or small leaves that recalls designs of Type 46 A. Sometimes the ornament is a wavy garland of leaves, stemming from sources close to Type 46 C. The nozzles may bear palmettes or leaves, or sometimes a continuation of the principal ornamentation across their tops. All of these motifs, seen earlier in one form or another, show again the lack of imaginative development in this period as well as the continued close connection between the fabricants of lamps and the fabricants of pottery, especially Megarian bowls, with which these motifs have close connections. A further tie with pottery manufacturers is offered by a signature that appears on some of these lamps. Hephaistion signed two: with his first initial on 639 and with the first four letters of his name on 638. The same man or a man with the same name also made Megarian bowls; his signature appears on a mould for a bowl in the Agora inventory.1" Although this fabricant is known only by the first letters of his name, not the whole, Hephaistion is suggested as the restoration since it is a common name in Greek prosopography and one of the few that will fit."'" "14 P 1523, mentioned AJ.A., XLV, 1941, p. 221, note 78. This mould was found in the construction fill for the Middle Stoa (H-I-J 12-18) so cannot be later than ca. 150 B.C. The signature was incised in the mould before firing HAI C. It would have been retrograde on the finished bowls, as on our lamp. The grapevine design of this mould has only a distant relationship to the wavy garland of leaves on lamp 639. 145 There is no proper name Hephaistos. This is reserved for the god, and there is no indication that these lamps</page><page sequence="169">TYPE 48 C 163 The monogram H or the letters H PAI are not known on lamps later than the beginning of the 1st century B.C. This fabricant seems to have gone out of business after Sulla's sack of Athens in 86 B.c. It is interesting to see that his trade-mark, in the 2nd century B.c., was sometimes just the initial letter of his name, like the A of the unknown fabricant who placed that mark on lamps of Type 48 B. Single letters were used first, the complete names coming as a later development, perhaps as a result of several fabricants having the same initial, such as Ariston and Apollonides. Hephaistion could have been confused with Heras, whose name (in the genitive, HPAAO) appears on a lamp of the next generation. Another lamp-maker who signs an example of Type 48 C is AAE- (Alexander?). His signature, incised on the lamp itself before firing, occurs on 641. It is also seen on fragments of bases that cannot be assigned with assurance to any individual type (838-840). Local Attic clay, as well as the presence of two moulds, attests to the Athenian manufacture of these wares. The lamps are glazed inside and out, with rather poor glaze, ranging from black to various shades of brown and red. 638 (L 134). Pls. 26, 48. H. 0.033 m.; W. 0.063 m.

Plate 48. Late 9nd century B.C. Dating based on the stylistic similarity to Type 48 C and on the finding place of 647. This small group of lamps has the tall decorated sides and flat nozzle formations characteristic of Type 48 C, of which it may almost be considered a variant, together with a pronouncedly concave plain top. A single lamp, 645, preserves its raised and slightly concave base. The sides of all these lamps are in two parts, the lower one shallow and flaring, the upper one taller and more vertical. There is always a pronounced ridge around the sunken concave discus, in the center of which is a simple filling-hole. A unique feature of this type is the reinforcing ring of clay applied by hand around the under side of the filling-hole before the two moulded halves of the lamp were joined. This procedure is not known on any other lamps (although it is almost impossible to detect its lack or existence on well preserved specimens). The clay ring strengthens the thin concave discus and prevents the chipping of the edge of the filling-hole. The lamps have vertical band handles. The characteristic nozzle formation is long, flattened on top, with an oval or blunted end, not pointed; in this there is a strong reminiscence of Type 48 C. There is never a lug. The decoration in relief is applied to the upper halves of the body; the egg-and-dart and meander designs are similar to motifs that will be seen on imported lamps of Type 49 A. Here, however, the decoration is normally carried along the vertical sides of the nozzle as well. 646 has an exceptional nozzle with plain sides, but with the addition of a moulded decoration on its top. The clay and black to red glaze used both inside and outside point to an Athenian manu- facture for most of Type 48 D; the clay of 647 is grayish which suggests a foreign origin for this specimen. Since the decorations of this specimen are suggestive of an eastern origin and bear relationships to those of the Ephesos type (49 A), it may be supposed that 647 was imported, and copied locally soon after its arrival. It is likely that the lamps (except the imported example) are the work of a single fabricant; perhaps he himself was a foreigner familiar with the strange technique of the inner reinforcing circle. A local Athenian manufacturer might well copy the imported exterior by taking casts, but would not, presumably, take the lamp apart and familiarize himself with its odd interior. None of the lamps of Type 48 D bears a signature. 645 (L 4096). P1.48. H. 0.035 m.; W. 0.064 m. Complete except for handle and minor chips; restored.

Last quarter of 2nd century B.c. Dating based on similar lamps from Antioch (assigned to second half of 9nd and early years of 1st centuries B.C.) and on the finding place of 648. This type, at present seen in only one example at the Agora, is well known at other sites, such as Delos,"' Alexandria,1'7 and Antioch."' The specimens from these other sites are not of Attic clay, unlike the Agora example which is undoubtedly a local product. It is difficult to say whether the Athenian lamp served as a model for the others or vice-versa. Due to the relative scarcity of the type in Athens and because of certain decorative features, it seems plausible to assume that the originals flourished outside of Athens and were occasionally copied here. Our specimen has a double-convex body rising from a low ring foot; the filling-hole is com- paratively small, in the middle of a small concave top. There is no lug. The lamp was equipped with a broad vertical strap handle. The nozzle has a rounded termination with a flat band sur- rounding the wick-hole, projecting from the tubular shank of the nozzle, which is decorated with a palmette in relief. The decorated upper sides of Type 48 E, with concentric semicircles and nodules between pairs of dotted lines, may be seen more clearly in an Alexandrian example in the Benachi Col- lection (P1. 55, Benachi 5). One sees here, more accurately portrayed than in the Agora example, the rope motif that bridges the top of the nozzle. The use of the flat rim around the wick-hole recalls not only a metal prototype, but specific imported clay lamps that have this feature, such as 659 of Type 49 A. The use of the palmette on the nozzle, although often seen in Hellenistic Athenian lamps, also seems originally to have had a foreign origin (cf. Type 45 A). These features would suggest that Type 48 E originated abroad, although a careful consideration of the concentric semicircles and nodules that serve as the lamps' chief decorations might suggest an Athenian origin. Such motifs appear on local Megarian bowls of this period.149 The clay is Attic; metallic glaze mottled black and brown covers the inside and outside. 648 (L 1401). P1. 48. H. 0.024 m.; W. 0.044 m.

Plate 49. Corinth: classified under Type XIX. From last quarter of 2nd century B.C. into first quarter of 1st century after Christ. Dating based on the finding places of the lamps. At other sites this type flourished at about the same time."'O This type is known as the Ephesos type because of the vast numbers found at that site, now in the Museum in Vienna, the British Museum,"' and elsewhere.'52 It was produced in Asia Minor fairly early in the 2nd century B.c., but there is no certain evidence for its importation into Athens before 125 B.C. In the generation following that date Athens enjoyed an unusual prosperity with a marked taste for luxuries, unlike most other Greek cities. Many foreign goods were imported through Delos which was particularly active commercially in this period, under Athenian domina- tion, down to 88 B.C."'5 It is interesting that the first appearance of Type 49 A occurs in Athens at the same time that the new Roman province of Asia was organized (133-199 B.C.). Trade was opened up even further between the east and Hellas after this date, as may be seen by the great importations of pottery and other objects from Asia Minor that are evident in Athens during these and subsequent years. The lamps vary little in shape, but enormously in decoration. The typical Ephesos lamp has a slightly raised base which is oval rather than circular, with a suggestion of a point toward the nozzle. These lamps are adaptations in clay of metal prototypes; the projection and weight of a heavy metal nozzle might have been the reason for the extension of the base toward the front of the lamp. The sides are double-convex with a sharp angle between the two halves. The top is flat with a central filling-hole usually surrounded by a narrow ridge; the filling-hole and ridge are normally made in the mould, not punched through after the lamp was removed from the moulds. 664, however, shows an unusual instance of a punched filling-hole. Occasionally the little ridge is omitted, and this may be taken as one of the few distinguishing marks between early and late lamps within this remarkably homogeneous group that spans more than a hundred years: 662 and 664, without these ridges, are dateable in the earliest years of the 1st century after Christ.'5" A distinctive feature of the Ephesos lamps is the flaring collar, made separately and added by hand, that surrounds the top; this collar or flange serves a useful purpose in keeping the oil from spilling over the sides when the lamp is filled. Since the spilled oil that might collect within the collar cannot drain back through the filling-hole, because of its little ridge, there are necessarily drain-holes. These are normally three in number, punched through the leather-hard clay at the 150 In Corinth these lamps appear during the second half of the 1st century B.C. (Broneer, p. 70). Lamps of this type have been found in Sardis (T. L. Shear, AJ.A., XXVI, 1992, p. 401) with figurines dated in the late Snd or Ist centuries B.C. (D. Burr, Terracottas from Myrina, Vienna, 1934, p. 17). One undecorated specimen was found among the objects from the shipwreck at Anticythera, ca. middle of Ist century B.C. (?): Svoronos, 'EQ. 'Apx., 1902, pp. 145 if., pl. H, 28. It is significant that none has come to light in the extensive groups of pottery and lamps, dated before 150 B.C., that underlie the Stoa of Attalos and the Middle Stoa in the Athenian Agora. 151 Walters, nos. 326-349. 152 See Broneer, pp. 66-70, for a good discussion of the type. 15s Ferguson, Hellenistic Athens, pp. 373-374, 406-407. " The former because of its finding place; the latter because its signature, TTAPAMONOY, also occurs on 665 of Type 49 B that was found in a filling of this date.</page><page sequence="173">TYPE 49 A 167 same time the collar is added. 664 is an exceptional example without these ancillary holes, but needs none since its filling-hole was punched and lacks the little ridge around it. 663 and 651 also have none, but they are provided with channels on their nozzles that lead superfluous oil into the wick-hole, although on 651 this was prevented by the added collar that cuts across the channel. The handles show their bronze ancestry. They are broad vertical ring handles, but grooved as if the original metal handles had been made of three narrow bands. A pair of Ephesos lamps in Corinth show clay cross pieces, made as if to hold the bands together."' All Type 49 A lamps had these handles, which were made separately and added to the lamps on top of the decorated sides. No lamp has a lug, which seems to have been an Attic device. The nozzles are another characteristic feature of this group. They are normally flat on top but flare sharply downward on the sides; the usual tips are crisply triangular with sharp flukes, but some Ephesos lamps have wide circular or oval terminations often bordered by a narrow flat band. None of these latter forms can be assuredly dated before Sulla. Corinth has many 58 from the second half of the 1st century B.C.; it is quite possible that this oval form is a later development within the type, occurring during the middle and later years of the 1st century B.C. An occasional nozzle is tubular in section, as 660, without decoration and perhaps to be assigned to the later years of the type's development. A few lamps are seen with a channel on top of the nozzle uniting the flat top or discus with the wick-hole. This feature was to be very popular in Roman lamps, but was not used by Athenian fabricants before the appearance of Type 49 A. The flattened top of the nozzle is normally decorated with a device in relief. The upper parts of the sides are also decorated with a rich vocabulary of designs.7" All of the decoration was produced from moulds, although sometimes it may be so crisp and in such high relief that one might mistakenly think that separate stamped or moulded motifs had been added to the lamp before firing. The moulds themselves may have been made occasionally from metal lamps, but more often they were created independently. A lamp-maker would incise his mould or the mould for his matrix with a running design, cutting into its unfired clay with a sharp stylus, or he would stamp his mould with a series of small dies, poinrons, bearing individual motifs. A clear example of the former practice may be seen on 653 where the petals are individually designed by cutting into clay, and where there is a great profusion of dots which are simply the reverse of little punched holes; 654 was made similarly. A good example of the other manner of manufacture, using small dies, may be seen on 650; here three different dies were used, several times each, to cut a series of repeated motifs into the mould. 651 was also made this way; its rosettes are exactly alike with the same uneven elements in the same places. Sometimes both methods of mould-making may be used together, as on the mould that produced 656. The designs on the little dies, consisting of rosettes and leaves for the most part, are similar to dies or stamps used by potters of this period; no moulded and decorated pottery, however, of the same gray clay and glaze as these lamps is known to have come from the Ephesos area to Athens. The designs on the lamps are varied; few are alike, nor does any of our lamps absolutely match another from sites elsewhere. The multi- plicity of designs is due to the fact that moulds could have served only for a short time before their delicate patterns were blurred; new ones were frequently made. An infinite number of designs may be made for moulds with a few stamps and freehand incision. The clay is gray, usually quite thin and almost brittle. The glaze is dark gray, with occasion- ally a metallic sheen, as on 649. 155 Broneer, pp. 68-69, nos. 343, 370, fig. 31. 156 Broneer, p. 68; p. 162, no. 335, fig. 88. 157 The various decorative motifs are mentioned below; every one of the Agora lamps bears a different decoration except for two uncatalogued examples that are similar to 659.</page><page sequence="174">168 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS Only one fabricant is known by a signed lamp in the Agora collections. 664 bears a name on its base in raised letters, retrograde.

These are simplied variants of the Ephesos type, rather carelessly made, without the crispness of the gray clay and black glaze that forms such a striking characteristic of the proto- type. The base of Type 49 B is very large, slightly raised and flat, and either circular as in 666 or almond shaped, recalling the typical form of Type 49 A. The low double-convex body usually has the same sharp angle between the two halves as on the preceding type. The broad flat discus or top has a small filling-hole without any ridge around it (thus obviating the need for extra</page><page sequence="176">170 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS drain-holes), as on 664, a late example of Type 49 A. There is no collar, a normal feature of the preceding type, but instead a narrow rim runs around the top separating it from the decorated sides; this feature also appears occasionally in late examples of Type 49 A. There are no lugs, of course. The handles are simple vertical ribbon handles, without the grooves that were a standard characteristic of the parent group. The nozzles are the same in both types, flat on top, flaring downwards at the sides, and ending in sharply pointed terminations. The decorative motifs are similar, but not in such a great variety; whereas all of the Agora specimens of Type 49 A differ to some extent from one another, there are only three patterns used on our examples of Type 49 B. The clay and glaze are different, of course, and point to a source far away from the home of the dark gray clay of the originals. The light brown clay can be Attic, and the red to brown glaze is characteristic of some Athenian products of this era. Two lamps are signed by Paramonos, who signed 664 of Type 49 A. It is possible that his signature was pirated, as well as his designs, by the fabricant who made 665 and 667 of Type 49 B. On the other hand, it is not improbable that this fabricant came to Athens and began production with his own models but utilized local materials. 665 (L 2933). Pls. 27, 49. H. 0.029 m.; W. 0.06 m.

Late 2nd century B.c. and 1st century B.c. Dating based on the similarities with wheelmade Knidos lamps of Type 40 A and on the associations with Type 50 B, which copies these imported examples and occurs in Athens as early as the late 2nd century B.c. The context of 668 offers a certain amount of information. This is not the proper Knidos type, which is wheelmade with a very different nozzle formation, and is considered under Types 40 A and B. The specimens that form Type 50 A are moulded and have the sharply fluked nozzles that characterize Type 49 A. The normal lamp has a flat raised base with a circular groove around its border, double-convex sides with a sharp angle between them, and a flat or concave top surrounded by a groove. The handle on 668 is missing, but may have been a banded double-coil handle as on the wheelmade Knidos lamps of Type 40 A. How-</page><page sequence="177">TYPE 50 B 171 ever, 669 retains a bit of its plain vertical band handle and it seems safer to consider this kind as the standard for the moulded Knidos lamps. There is no lug. The nozzle has a very narrow flat top, spreading out in a triangular shape to the wick-hole which is enclosed in a sharply pointed termination. The under side of the nozzle has a long central ridge or sharp angle, extending back to the lamp's raised base. The moulded decorations of Type 50 A are simple, consisting of broad heart-shaped ivy leaves in relief, two on either side of the lamps shoulder. The gray clay and dark gray glaze, both inside and outside, show an origin close to the eastern center where Type 49 A was made. Although few of Type 50 A seem to have been imported into Athens, their features became popular; not only were they reproduced locally, as seen in the following types, but various characteristics such as the circular grooved base and the nozzle formation became influential on the designs of other late Athenian types of lamps. 668 (L 2696).

Corinth: classified under Type XVIII. From last quarter of 2nd century B.C. into early years of 1st century after Christ. These Athenian versions of the Knidos lamps enjoyed popularity and a long life. They first appeared during the prosperous decades that preceded the sack of Athens by Sulla, and then were revived later in the 1st century B.c., when local lamp production was again resumed. There is no appreciable difference between the early and late examples of this remarkably uniform type except that the earlier lamps tend to be somewhat larger and made of a finer quality of clay. Occasionally, however, a fine large one turns up at the end of the era, as 671. There is always a definite flat raised base, sometimes plain but sometimes with a light groove around its circumference as on the parent lamps of Type 50 A. A single example, 675, has the almond-shaped raised base which recalls that characteristic of Type 49 A, also an imported group. The sides are double-convex, without the sharp angle between them that is typical of the parent Type 50 A. The nozzle formation, however, is an exact replica of the prototype's. It is flat on top, flaring out to a pronouncedly bold triangular termination, with a little impressed dot on either side of the wick-hole; its bottom has the usual sharp angle down the center. There is never a lug, always a vertical flat band handle, although 674 varies the scheme by having a basket handle that bridges the circular top. The top is always deeply concave with a well-marked groove around it. Sometimes the whole upper part of the lamp is encased in a protective collar, added by hand, that</page><page sequence="178">172 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS serves to collect oil that might spill over when the lamp is filled. In such cases there are, of course, several ancillary drain-holes to allow the return of the oil to the reservoir. The relief decoration does not vary. There is always a neatly moulded heart-shaped leaf and a convex disc on each shoulder. The leaf was seen on Type 50 A, and the disc appeared on wheel- made Knidos lamps of Type 40 A. A single example, 676, adds another motif between the leaf and the disc, a small bud, shaped like the letter psi. The clay is Attic, rather coarse in some of the later examples. All the lamps are glazed inside and outside; the glaze is poor and flaky, black to brown to red, although the earlier examples seem to have more careful applications. Two lamps bear signatures. That of 670 is completely illegible; the letters were incised, under the glaze. In a similar way 673 was signed by Demetrios.

Plate 50. 1st century after Christ, ca. second to third quarters, perhaps a little later. Dating based on the fact that the slim broken-barred alpha that appears on 677 is common on lamps of later types, beginning with Type 52 H, that may be dated in the second quarter of 1st century after Christ or later, and on the finding place of 677. These are examples of the decline in the local production of Type 50 B. The traits that they have in common with Types 50 A and B are numerous. These include the presence of a flat raised circular base, the double-convex body, the flat-topped, flaring nozzle terminating in a pronounced triangle, the sharp angle down the under side of the nozzle, and the ubiquitous moulded decoration in which the heart-shaped leaves and the convex discs play an important role. The concave discus surrounded by a groove is also here, contrasting strongly with the convex body. These lamps are coarsely made of thick clay which can be a local product. They are glazed, or washed, with thin red or brown paint. One lamp, 677, is signed with an alpha in relief. This is made in a manner similar to the alphas of Types 52 H, 53, etc. There is no clue to the meaning of this letter or to the maker's identity. It will be seen later that there are at least five known fabricants of the 1st centuries B.c. and after Christ whose names begin with this initial (Apollonides, Apollonios, Ariston, Aineios/-as, and Asklepiades). 677 (L 3905).

The ridges are moulded rather than added separately as on Type 49 A. Their shapes demonstrate a certain uniformity also, and recall Types 49 A and 50 A in the broad spreading convex shoulders that bear the decoration. No lower portions, nozzles, nor handles are preserved. The clay is non-Attic, always gray; the black or dark gray glaze used inside and out, except on 681 which is unglazed inside, is similar to that of Types 49 A and 50 A. An eastern origin or origins may be claimed for Type 50 D, places that produced the terra nigra which is a common feature with the Ephesos and Knidos types. They were all imported during the later Hellenistic period and bear witness again to the close commercial relations between Athens and the east that culminated in the vast expansion of trade through Delos in the last quarter of the 2nd century B.C.

Dating based on the stylistic similarity to Types 48 C, D, and on the finding places. With Type 51 A the sequence of late Hellenistic lamps is resumed after the interruptions caused by the imported examples of Types 49 and 50. Type 51 A is really a morphological con- tinuation of the various Types 48, but both here and in the succeeding types one sees the impact of the foreign influences, especially in the emphasis on the pointed nozzle. The whole character of</page><page sequence="181">TYPE 51 B 175 late Greek and early Roman lamps was changed by the virtual abandonment of the oval-tipped nozzle that had been a heritage from early wheelmade types. Type 51 A is a small group of locally made lamps that conservatively repeats many aspects of Types 48 C and D. Only the bluntly-pointed triangular nozzle tip and the base show new developments that were unknown to the parent groups. Type 51 A has a flat raised base with a suggestion of an almond shape, as if the base of the nozzle were pulling the circular bottom a little out of line. More emphatic almond-shaped bases were seen in Type 49 A. The sides are high, double-convex, and the flat or slightly concave circular top is depressed below the level of the decorated sides. There is not, however, any pronounced ridge or groove around the top nor around the wide filling-hole. The nozzles are broad and flat, extending out to their bluntly- pointed ends. They have decorations on them; an incised herringbone pattern is seen on two examples; a third has a pair of ridges emphasizing the sides of the nozzle. There is always at least one lug as on 685, where it is a simple solid protuberance. Other lamps have pairs of S-shaped scroll lugs, recalling those features of Type 45 C; the lugs are always high on the lamps' shoulders. One lamp is without a handle, but 683 shows that the normal handle was of the usual flat vertical band variety. The decorations are simple, consisting of the parallel rays or grooves around the upper part of the body that are characteristic of Type 48 A. Good thick Attic clay and a very decent black to brown glaze establish the local origin of the type. None bears a signature. 683 (L 4104). P1. 50. H. 0.037 m.; W. 0.064 m.

This group of crisply made lamps continues the tradition of Type 48 A, but employs the new pointed nozzle, with a very neat pattern of a fan-shaped or flame-shaped palmette, made of a group of rays. The clay is Attic, very finely worked, and the good black or red glaze on inside and outside shows that this group was the product of several very meticulous Athenian craftsmen. All of our examples come from clean moulds; none is carelessly made or defective as the result of a mould being used too many times. Two moulds have been found and are included in the catalogue.</page><page sequence="182">176 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS The lamps have a variety of bases, all circular, but ranging from a raised concave bottom to a simulated ring foot to an actual ring foot. The presence of the latter shows a close connection between the lamp-maker and the potter. There is nearly always a solid lug on the left side of the shoulder, invariably cornucopia-shaped; one of the uncatalogued examples, however, omits this feature. There is always a broad vertical band handle. The nozzle is rounded on top and ends in a blunt triangle. A very low thin ridge outlines the periphery of the end of the nozzle, which is decorated on top with the moulded palmette design, the individual lines of which are arranged in a flame pattern with curving ends. Some of the nozzles have a sharp angle on their under sides, as on Types 50 A and B, while others have the old-fashioned rounded throat. The shoulders are usually decorated with moulded rays, numerous and very close together; a few lamps have an imbricated leaf pattern reminiscent of Type 46 B. The tops are small, with little concentric ridges around them and the filling-holes. Those lamps bearing the imbricated decorations on their shoulders have wide concave tops with moulded rosettes on the centers. Some lamps have hand- made collars surrounding the entire body and nozzle; in such cases of course there are the necessary drain-holes, usually one on either side of the junction of the nozzle and the body. An unusual touch of artistry is seen occasionally in the scraping away of the glaze around the edge of a collar or from the top of a ridge around a top. This makes a pleasant contrast between the revealed buff clay and the glazed surface of the remainder of the lamp. Similar scraped grooves were seen on contemporary wheelmade lamps. A couple of fabricants are known. Ariston signed one of the moulds, 689, and three of the lamps. In every case the signature was incised in the mould, so that the letters are in relief on the lamps. His signature appears always in the genitive form, whether the letters run around the base in a circular manner or appear in two horizontal lines. Ariston is not known as a fabricant on later lamps, after 86 B.C. His signature is known on two other Agora lamps, both of them fragments of bases, 850 and 851, which need not date after the first quarter of the 1st century B.C. He and his shop must have been among the casualties of Sulla's invasion. He is also known as a potter who worked in this period.58 Another lamp, 690, is signed IQ (?) which may stand for Sopatros who signed lamps in the later years of the 1st century B.C. 686 (L 1858).

Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 51 B and the finding place of 693. This small group of lamps abandons the decorated nozzle which had been a feature of most relief lamps since Type 45 A, in the 3rd century B.C. The plain nozzle combined with a decorated top appeared in the later imported Hellenistic lamps, however, such as the influential Types 49 A and 50 A. These latter are doubtless the prototypes for this new group, which flourished (in later versions) into the early Roman period, after 86 B.C. The bottoms are always raised and circular, with the bottom end of the nozzle flush with the raised base. When the mould is worn the round base gives the illusion of being pointed and con- tinuing into the bottom of the nozzle formation; this arrangement was to be common on lamps of the later 1st century B.C. and the early 1st century after Christ. The plain nozzle is rounded or slightly angular on top and ends in a pointed termination. Both of the catalogued examples have restored tips, but one of the uncatalogued specimens shows that its nozzle could not have had the earlier Hellenistic rounded end. The filling-holes are set in small round centers that are flat or nearly so, with a raised ridge encircling the whole top and sometimes also the filling-hole. There is always a vertical ribbon handle; sometimes a solid cornucopia-shaped or delphiniform lug appears high up on the left side of the shoulder. The moulded decoration is of two types. 693 shows an imbricated leaf pattern, like that appearing on 691 of Type 51 B. Lamps with this pattern have the lug on the left side and a rosette on the right side, a combination that will continue on lamps made after 86 B.C. The other decorative arrangement is simpler, a moulded rosette on either side of the body with no other adornment.</page><page sequence="184">178 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS Attic clay and fairly good black or brownish red glaze, both inside and out, indicate an Athenian origin for this little group.

TYPE 51 D VERY LARGE LATE HELLENISTIC RELIEF LAMPS; POINTED NOZZLES Nos. 695-696. Plate 51. Late 2nd and early 1st centuries B.C. If but one of these lamps had been found it might have been considered an exceptionally large variant of Type 48. Fragments of at least three are from fills of around 86 B.c. There were pre- sumably few of these monstrous examples made, but as such they are sufficiently important and distinctive to be classed as a separate type. The huge size is their most striking characteristic. They are the mouldmade counterparts, in size at least, of the large wheelmade Type 37 B. The base is circular and raised, slightly concave, and on 695 ornamented with an incised eight-petalled rosette. The lower sides are sharply rounded, the upper sides gently curved. The filling-hole is in the center of a deeply depressed circular center, which is bordered by two pronounced concentric ridges. There is a broad vertical ribbon handle; neither example is preserved sufficiently to show whether or not decorative lugs were used. The nozzle formation is distinctive, with an oval wick-hole encased within a pointed termina- tion and flanked by snail-shell volutes. On 695 these volutes are ornamented by small punches. The top of the nozzle is flat and offset, narrower than its base. Along the top are three ridges, descending from the body of the lamp and converging at a point on the rim of the wick-hole, which is in turn bordered by a neatly-made raised ridge; other ridges outline each side of the nozzle's top. It is possible that these large lamps had more than one nozzle, although none is sufficiently preserved to make this fact certain. The top of the lamp is decorated with a radiating design of long, neatly made tongues, arranged closely together like the ray pattern so common on Type 48 A. The clay is Attic as well as the good black glaze. The glaze on 695 is scraped from the groove between the two con- centric ridges separating the top from the sides. This decorative scraping is seen on other lamps, both wheelmade and mouldmade, of the very early 1st century B.c., and may be taken in itself as a criterion for dating in these years. Such large and sophisticated lamps may have been used in wealthy households, but their size also suggests a sanctuary use. Both of the catalogued specimens, although found with house- hold pottery, are from cisterns not very far from sanctuaries on the Areopagus and on Kolonos Agoraios. 696 was accompanied in its cistern by several multi-nozzled wheelmade lamps that might suggest provenance from a sanctuary.</page><page sequence="185">TYPE 51 VARIANTS 179 A later version of Type 51 D, made during the 1st century B.c., has some additional early Roman characteristics and is considered under Type 52 G. 695 (L 3313).

Late 2nd and early 1st centuries B.C. to 86 B.C. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 51 B, 51 C and late examples of Type 48 A, as well as on the finding place of 698. These three lamps differ in details, which are considered under their catalogued descriptions, but they all bear some relationship to Type 51 rather than to other types, and are a miscellany that were made shortly before the disastrous events of 86 B.C. All have pointed nozzles, vertical band handles, and decorated tops and nozzles that follow established patterns. 697 looks backward to Type 48 A, but it has the pointed nozzle of other types that come in after the middle of the 2nd century B.C. 698 and 699 look forward; they have some aspects of Types 51 B and C, but certain traits continued into the early Roman period of the later 1st century B.C. These two were both signed by the fabricant Apollonides who survived the Sullan disaster to continue the manufacture of later lamps in Athens. An Apollonides is also known as a potter of this period.'59 All lamps in this group of Type 51 Variants show by their clay and glaze that they were locally produced. 697 (L 3871). Pl. 50.

TYPE 52 A EARLY ROMAN; RAYS WITH ROSETTE AND LUG (EARLY) Nos. 700-704 (and 3 others inventoried). Plates 25-27, 51. 1st century B.C., ca. second to third quarters. Dating based on some stylistic similarities to Type 51 C, and on the finding place of 700 and 702. These lamps form a kind of transitional group from the vast bulk of lamps decorated with rays made before 86 B.c. to those manufactured in Athens after that disastrous year. It is quite possible that a few of these were made just before Sulla's invasion. One is signed by Apollonides whose factory flourished both before and after the sack of Athens. The finding place of 700 and 702 would allow a possible date before 86 B.C., although the inference is that they were made after that year. One assumes that very little production took place in the years immediately following Sulla, but when the industry was revived the lamps of Type 52 A were among the first to be produced.'60 The decoration of the lamps recalls that seen occasionally on Type 51 C, yet it was to appear more frequently on types of the late 1st century B.C. The normal lamp has a simple circular raised base, sometimes concave. The double-convex body has a vertical ribbon handle, a large filling-hole surrounded by several concentric grooves and ridges, and always a solid lug. The lug is usually a slim delphiniform or cornucopia-shaped device, but 703 introduces a lug in the shape of a flaming torch, an appropriate insigne. Except on this lamp, Type 52 A always has a moulded rosette on the right side, as seen occasionally on Type 51 C. The tops are invariably decorated with the ray pattern, seen so often on both earlier and later lamps. Sometimes there is an encircling collar around the entire lamp. The nozzles form one criterion of the type. Very long and bluntly pointed, they are rounded on top and have a pattern of nine to eleven parallel ridges, each one, except for the central one, ending in a small spiral. The nozzles are invariably rounded on their under sides. Attic clay and fairly good although worn black glaze testify to an Athenian origin; occasionally the glaze is scraped away from the edge of the collar, when such exists. Three fabricants' names appear; they include Apollonides who had produced examples of Type 51 Variants and Ion, not known earlier, who signed two of these Agora examples. Ion signed other lamps of the later first century B.C.; this later appearance of his name (on Type 54 C) is further evidence to corroborate a date for Type 52 A in the 1st century somewhere between 86 B.c. and its last quarter. A third maker, not known previously nor afterward, is Aphrodisios who carefully signed 704 in relief and added a dolphin below. This is a well known Athenian name among public figures in this period, but it is not known as that of an artisan. Perhaps this fabricant who apparently produced few 160 Two of these, although not found in trustworthy contexts, were associated with pottery fragments that seem far more characteristic of the middle years of the 1st century B.C. than of its first decade.</page><page sequence="187">TYPE 5U B 181 signed works belonged to a distinguished family and for that reason added his personal device, a family insigne, the dolphin of Aphrodite. 700 (L 1787).

Type 52 B always has an almond-shaped base, usually flat but sometimes slightly concave or raised and with the effect of a base-ring. The almond-shaped base appears on Roman lamps in the last quarter of the 1st century B.c. but never earlier. The double-convex body is similar to that of the preceding type, together with the customary vertical band handle and the little round center that is surrounded by a circular ridge and nearly entirely occupied by the filling-hole. The decoration of the upper body is the same, with a ray pattern on which are superimposed a solid lug and a rosette, on the left and right sides respectively. The lugs are of various shapes; a cornucopia diagonally banded appears often, as does a device that seems to be a torch with a fluted handle and conventionalized flame. A third lug device appears on some lamps, very low in the body but cast only in the upper mould, that portrays a thunderbolt with a narrow grip between two effulgent flames. The form of the rosette does not change.</page><page sequence="188">182 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS The nozzle formation is another criterion that separates Type 52 B from 52 A. Here it is a long projection with three parallel ridges along the top; the two side ridges flare out at their ends and turn back sharply to form little volutes either side of the wick-hole; the central ridge ends in a point at the edge of the wick-hole, which is contained in a large flat pointed termination. There is a small impressed dot on either side of the triangular tip of the nozzle. All of these features are intended on every lamp, but worn moulds and careless workmanship have sometimes obliterated one or more of the small details. The rather thin brittle clay is Attic. The glaze is also thin, often no more than a diluted wash and carelessly applied. It normally is used for the entire outside and inside coating, but one does not see here the decorative scraping away of the glaze from the edge of the encircling collar, when such a device is used to surround a lamp, as often appeared on earlier lamps of the 2nd and 1st centuries B.c. The thin glaze or wash is sometimes very poorly applied, with no attempt to cover completely the lower parts of the body. In such cases the wash dribbles down in an unsightly way from the coated surfaces above. This was to be characteristic of many Athenian lamps of these years, although such poor workmanship might be thought characteristic of later Roman periods. It must not be forgotten that although many very handsome lamps were made in Athens around the turn of the era, inspired by Italian prototypes, a substantial amount of shoddy work was produced like these, utilizing old-fashioned designs and providing the poorer citizens with cheap lamps. Several manufacturers are known. Two lamps are signed by Proteas, the name being incised in the genitive before the lamps were fired. His signature appears also on lamps of other types of this period. Isidotos also signed two, in the same manner; he also will produce other designs during these years. One lamp is signed with sigma, omega, pi; the letters are in relief since they had been scratched hastily in the mould when it was leather-hard. These letters stand for the name Sopatros, who is a well known fabricant signing many lamps in the late 1st century B.c. and early 1st century after Christ. The manufacturer made a small error, however, for the lunate sigma is turned the wrong way. This is understandable if one considers a hasty poorly-educated craftsman confronted with the task of writing a name backwards, as it had to be on the mould in order to come out correctly on the lamp.'"' A fourth fabricant is represented on a lamp signed by Poplios. This is the Hellenized form of Publius, and represents an Italian craftsman working in Athens. His name is not known on other lamps. The example that he signed, 706, does not differ at all from other lamps of Type 52 B, and he incised his signature in the same manner and with the same letter forms as Proteas and Isidotos. 705 (L 2344).

Ca. third quarter of 1st century B.c. and at least into first quarter of 1st century after Christ. The bases are always almond-shaped, and either flat or slightly concave; they are never raised. Those lamps with concave bases combined with a fairly decent black or red glaze are early within the type, certainly in the 1st century B.c., as 718 shows. There is always a narrow little flat top with a large filling-hole, the whole surrounded by a neat circular ridge. All of the Agora examples were given handles, and an occasional lamp has an encircling collar with the requisite drain-holes. The lugs are the distinctive feature here. Often they are placed very low, on the left side of the lamp, and here they always have the shape of a small thunderbolt. This recalls the thunderbolt placed low on the left side of an occasional lamp of Type 52 B. The low thunderbolt is used throughout the entire duration of the type; it cannot be classed as an early or late feature. All the other lug designs occur fairly high up on the body, overlying the ray pattern of the shoulders; their varying designs include the delphiniform shape, the torch shape seen on Type 52 B, and a</page><page sequence="190">184 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS rough boss that could be either delphiniform or a cornucopia, punched with small dots. This last variety of lug occurs only on lamps having a certain distinctive nozzle formation, where there is a single groove on top that bifurcates and extends out to a dot on either side of the triangular termination. 722 illustrates this combination of the dotted lug and bifurcating groove. The nozzles on other lamps are the same as those seen on Type 52 B; the top decoration consists of three parallel ridges, the two side ridges turning back on themselves in a volute-like manner. A single lamp, 725, has a short flat-topped nozzle with a grape cluster in relief as an ornament. A mould for the tops of lamps shows that Type 52 C was produced in Athens; the clay of all is Attic, of a fairly good quality. It is used in a heavy fabric for some of the early Augustan examples and these have a thick glaze fired red, carefully applied all over, both inside and outside. The clay is somewhat thinner and the black glaze is very much poorer on the majority of the other examples of the type. No lamps have the careless applications seen occasionally on Type 52 B, where the lower parts were treated only with stray streaks dribbling down from the upper portions. Several fabricants signed Type 52 C. Isidotos, seen on Type 52 B, signed one example with the first three letters of his name, in relief. Proteas, also appearing on Type 52 B, signed one example with the first three letters of his name incised in the soft clay before firing. Apollonides, known on Types 51 Variants and 52 A, signed another one in relief, retrograde. Other lamp manu- facturers who signed at least one example of Type 52 C include Aineias (or Aineios) who signed his lamp in the mould, retrograde, so that the signature appears in relief and reading in the right direction; he will be seen on other carefully made lamps of this era that show the work of a deliberate craftsman. 716 bears a fragmentary signature in relief that may be that of Lysias (or Lysios or Lykios) who will be known from other lamps of this period. An unknown fabricant signed 724 with EA in relief; there are no manufacturers whose names begin with these two letters; the signature is presumably not retrograde for Asklepiades, who is known, because the carefully made sigma is not reversed. 723 is signed with a ligature that is difficult to transcribe, but possibly may be resolved as AA PI-; Adrianos is not known elsewhere as a lamp-maker. 714 (L 4705).

Ca. third quarter of 1st century B.C. to early years of 1st century after Christ. Dating based on stylistic similarities with Type 52 C and other lamps of the period between Sulla and Augustus. This small group of lamps shows a revival of interest in an early Hellenistic motif, a pair of lugs as ornamentation. These appeared as early as the 3rd century B.C. on Types 45 A, B and C. This manifestation in the post-Sullan period may be considered less as a proper revival than a regularization of the lug and rosette theme that appears on contemporary Type 52 B. In every respect these lamps are characteristic of the second half of the 1st century B.C. The</page><page sequence="192">186 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS large base is flat and almond-shaped, the ray pattern is finely detailed, the little flat top is sur- rounded by a broad low ridge. All of these lamps have handles. The lugs are uniformly in the shape of a cornucopia, placed fairly high up on the body and cast in the upper mould only. The nozzle is exactly like that of Type 52 C, the popular variety with three ridges along its top that is seen so many times on post-Sullan lamps. The clay is Attic, the glaze is a good reddish brown application all over the lamp, evenly coated. None of these lamps is signed, unfortunately; one would like to know the names of the craftsmen who turned out these neat little productions. Two of the Agora examples are from the same mould, 726 and one of the uncatalogued examples (L 1825). It is likely that one shop produced the whole type, probably during a very few years of the rather wide era that can be assigned to it. 726 (L 4305). Pl. 51. H. 0.035 m.; W. 0.07 m.

TYPE 52 E EARLY ROMAN: RAYS WITHOUT LUGS; FLAT TOPS; GROOVES ON NOZZLES Nos. 727-738 (and 13 others inventoried). Plates 25-28, 51. Corinth: classified under Type XVIII. Third quarter of 1st century B.C. into the earliest years of the 1st century after Christ (Augustan). A number of craftsmen in the second half of the 1st century B.c. decided to make lamps without any lugs at all. The lugs had not served any useful purpose for a generation or so; they were decorative and vestigial remnants of a device that was functional only when pierced. After the Augustan period the lug was never again to be seen on Roman lamps. Type 52 E is not so uniform as its predecessor. There are slight variations in the bases and nozzle formations, but it is impossible to date them as occurring early or late within the type. Some lamps have a circular base; this might be thought an early feature, yet it occurs not only on 736, a known early lamp, but also on 735, one of the latest examples. Usually the bases are almond-shaped, typical of lamps around the turn of the era; these are slightly concave or flat, with the possibility existing that the former may be early and the latter more advanced within the years of the type's floruit. The bodies are uniformly double-convex, with a carefully modelled ray pattern on the upper parts. There is always a thick vertical band handle and a small flat circular top surrounded by a broad raised ridge. The filling-hole usually occupies most of the top, although on occasion it may be small in proportion to the diameter of the top, as 736 or surrounded by its own little ridge, as 734. The nozzle is always long and pointed; its usual decoration is that of the two preceding types: three parallel ridges of which the outer two turn back on themselves, and an impressed circle either side of the wick-hole. The variations on the nozzle design are slight; 736 has multiple ridges and grooves on its top; 735 omits the flaring returns and the impressed circles; 737 has a pair of grooves that curl back at both ends with an impressed palmette between. These three lamps show the only exceptions to the standard nozzle design seen not only on this type but often on other types during the years between Sulla and Augustus.</page><page sequence="193">TYPE 52 E 187 The clay of Type 52 E is Attic. The lamps are glazed all over with sometimes a good thick black or red glaze, sometimes with a thin red wash. When the thin wash is applied it is often carelessly used without a complete coverage of the under sides. Such a treatment is typical of other types made around the turn of the era. A large number of signatures turns up on Type 52 E. Apollonios appears once, not to be confused with the Apollonides previously known. His name signed in the genitive is in high relief, having been incised in the mould retrograde. Two catalogued lamps and two uncatalogued examples all bear the cryptic signature TTA, incised on the lamp itself when leather-hard, with a small pi and large alpha. Since it is very clear that the inscriptions were incised rather than being the imprint of raised letters on the mould, the two letters must be read in their proper sequence, left to right. If they had been made in the mould it would seem natural to read them backwards, interpreting them as the first two letters of Apollonides or Apollonios. It is possible that the well known lamp-maker's name, Paramonos, which appeared on Types 49 A and B, was pirated or maintained in this later period, reduced to its first two letters. It is odd that the initial pi is so much less emphasized than the alpha. Perhaps the large alpha that appeared alone on Type 48 B came to be associated with a certain high quality of workmanship, and a later fabricant during the post-Sullan years of the first century B.C., wishing to identify himself with a grade-A product, purposely made his initial pi very small. It will be seen that shortly after this period, beginning around 25 after Christ, the alpha is used alone for a long duration, at least two hundred years, on many divergent types of lamps. This later and profuse use of the alpha can hardly be associated with the product of a single factory and might well signify a standard of quality that was desirable even though some of the products fell far short of the mark. Another lamp is signed by Isidotos, in the same manner that he used on a couple of lamps of Type 52 B. Sopatros signed another, in relief but with the letters reading correctly from left to right showing that it had been incised in the mould retrograde. Aineias (or Aineios) placed his name on 729 in the same manner. Dionysios appears once, with his signature incised directly on the clay before firing; his products are many, although this is the first of his signatures to be met. 730 is signed with two letters in relief, El, made in the mould. No known fabricant has a name beginning with these letters, nor are these two letters seen on any other lamp in the Agora or other collections. A large number of names could be suggested that begin with El; Eirenaios is the most common of them that occurred in Athens in this era. It is not inconceivable, of course, that the El is a variant spelling for A I, and that the lamp is one of the products of Aineios' or Aineias' shop. An unlettered fabricant might spell with either an alpha or epsilon the syllable that would be pronounced about the same in either case. Two lamps of Types 52 G and H are signed with A I, to be taken as the first two letters of this same manufacturer's name. Another lamp, 738, has letters in relief on its base, but they resemble no known signature and are difficult to decipher; they are probably retrograde, having been incised in the unbaked clay of the mould in their correct order. 727 (L 2983).

Plate 51. Late 1st century B.C. into early 1st century after Christ. Dating based on stylistic similarities with Type 52 E and on the finding place of 740. These neatly made lamps are so completely homogeneous that they could well be the work of a single anonymous fabricant working during the later years of the period of Type 52 E. He used the same small flat top with the broad flat ridge encircling it, seen on that type, but he went a step further. The flat top was connected with the wick-hole by a narrow channel, the sides of which are a continuation of the top's encircling ridge; these sides also take the place of the two outer ridges with which the nozzle was usually decorated in Type 52 E. The channel that results is useful, as any oil that oozes out of the wick-hole can be returned to the reservoir via the channel and filling-hole. Such a channel had appeared before, on Type 49 A, but it was not to achieve its greatest popularity until well on in the 1st century after Christ. There is a vestigial remnant of the third center ridge that was seen on Type 52 E, in the little raised tongue that emerges at the mouth of the channel adjoining the wick-hole. The triangular nozzle formation is completed by the addition of two impressed dots, exactly as in Type 52 E. The bottom of the nozzle is sharply angular in section. The base of Type 52 F is slightly almond-shaped and always given a false ring foot, a simulated base-ring. This was made in the mould, of course, but appears as a slightly raised base that is pronouncedly concave within a narrow border. It is an exaggeration of the slightly concave almond-shaped base often seen on Type 52 E and other lamps of the later 1st century B.c. There is always a thick vertical band handle, an absence of lugs, and a pattern of rays on the upper portion of the lamp. The rays are neatly fashioned into long tongues 'or petals, recalling the tongues seen on 737 of Type 52 E. The lamps come in two sizes. Both are of local Attic clay, but the large ones are covered with a thin red wash that is carelessly applied on the lower portions, leaving much uncoated; the small lamps have a black wash or thin dull glaze which was applied evenly all over but has worn badly. 739 (L 540).

Plates 25, 27, 51. 1st century B.C. Dating based on stylistic similarities in the nozzle formation to Types 59 B-E, and on the finding places. These large handsome lamps may be considered in some ways a later development of Type 51 D. The nozzle formation, however, relates them to Types 52 B-E of the 1st century B.c.; here is seen the same use of three parallel ridges with the two outer ones curving back on themselves; there is also the pair of impressed circles at the sides of the wick-hole in its bold triangular enclosure. The base is raised and circular, with a slight suggestion of concavity. The curving sides are decorated on their upper portions with a pattern that is basically rays, but carefully arranged into long deeply grooved petals or tongues, comparable to those on lamps of Type 52 F. The top is deeply concave, bordered by a narrow ridge. One of the lamps preserves its wide flat vertical handle. There are no lugs. The Attic clay is of a fine quality; the good black glaze is thickly applied all over the exterior and on the floor of the interior. The quality of the clay and glaze would suggest a date fairly early in the 1st century B.C., as would the raised circular base. The nozzle formation could occur any time between the early 1st century B.C. and the early years of the 1st century after Christ. The finding place of 742 might suggest that this type flourished over a long period, but there are only two lamps in this type, very much alike, and it is more likely that they were made at about the same time, shortly after Athens was recovering from the Sullan invasion. In that case 742 would be a carefully cherished household possession or sanctuary lamp that had a useful life for a number of decades before it was broken and thrown away shortly after the turn of the era. Both of the lamps are signed by fabricants known to have produced other wares during the 1st century B.C. One bears the letters Al, in relief, the first two letters of Aineias' (or Aineios') name, known from Types 52 C and E. The other lamp is signed in relief by Lysias (or Lysios or Lykios) in the genitive, who also signed Type 52 C. 742 (L 4711). Pls. 27, 51. H. 0.058 m.; W. 0.120 m.

Plates 25, 27, 51. Corinth: classified under Type XVIII. 1st century after Christ, from early years at least through third quarter. Type 52 H is the degenerate offspring of Type 52 G and at the same time is very closely related to Type 50 B, especially in the design of the top and the nozzle. Although it seems to have flourished for nearly a century, with comparatively few changes within the type, its greatest popu- larity was probably in the second and early third quarters of the 1st century after Christ. The usual form of the base is distinctive; it is prominently raised and completely flat, circular or very slightly ovular in shape. There are no almond-shaped bases here as seen so often on lamps of the 1st century B.C. and earliest years of the 1st century after Christ. A very few bases vary from the standard; a circular or oval base may occur that is flat or slightly concave rather than raised, and 746 has an oval base-ring with a moulded rosette within it. The tops are invariably concave and always surrounded by a circular ridge or groove, very often both. There is always a vertical band handle, sometimes flat but occasionally grooved down the middle. The handles tend to be thinner and narrower than those of previous decades; they are approaching the slimness that will be more characteristic of handles of the late 1st and early 2nd centuries after Christ. The pattern of rays on the upper body may be finely modelled as long petals or tongues, reminiscent of Type 52 G, or very crudely indicated, as on 750, or conventionally arranged as on most of Types 52 A-F. The degree of delicacy in the modelling of the rays is not, however, to be taken as a criterion for dating. The short nozzles are like those of Type 50 B. Most of them have pointed ends, narrow flaring flat tops, and an impressed circle either side of the wick-hole. Although the majority of their tops are plain, a few have decorative grooves or ridges; these are perhaps early within the group and related to Types 52 B-E; of these 748, 749 and 751 have the three parallel ridges, the multiple ridges, or the flaring grooves that are known on the earlier types. The normal nozzle has an angular profile on its under side, but this is exchanged for a rounded profile on a few of the lamps with the variant grooves or ridges on top of their nozzles. The presence of two moulds, one very fragmentary and uncatalogued, attests to local manu- facture; the clay also seems in all cases attributable to Attica. The glaze varies; it is never very good, but ranges from a well-applied dull black to a thin red to a brownish wash that trickles unevenly over the lower portions. Four lamps are signed. One bears the letters Al in relief, like an example of Type 52 G, and may be attributed to Aineias (or Aineios). Another has a single alpha in relief, like an example of Type 50 C; this was to be common on subsequent lamps, especially on those of the second quarter and middle of the 1st century after Christ. The alpha may stand for the initial of a fabricant or shop, or possibly, as suggested before, may be a symbol denoting prime quality, used freely by numerous artisans who occasionally lapsed from the high standards of workmanship implied. One lamp has the incised letters A A, presumably for a lamp-maker whose name begins with these letters; no certain one is known from this or other collections; there are numerous names in Attic prosopography to choose as candidates that begin with AA, but no certainty that any</page><page sequence="198">19N THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS was a lamp-maker. A fourth lamp, 748, has an incised signature or signatures, in two lines. One line reads ATT, which may stand for Apollonides or Apollonios; the lower line is incised upside down (not retrograde) and reads, when the lamp is held in the opposite direction, A E. There seem to be no missing letters. Perhaps this represents a collaboration between two fabricants, one already known through his full signature and the other one to be identified with the A E whose first two letters, carefully made in relief, are found on a fragment of a raised circular base, 840, which cannot be assigned to a particular type of lamp. 744 (L 2407).

First half of 1st century after Christ. Type 53 forms a small group, the members of which are distinctive and unrelated to other early Roman lamps except in some small details. The usual base is flat and oval rather than</page><page sequence="200">194 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS pronouncedly almond-shaped. Occasionally the oval flat base may be raised, with a groove around its outer edge, as on 757. The double-convex sides have a very pronounced curve on their upper parts so that the body of the lamp has a resemblance to a fat pin-cushion. The flat circular top has a raised ridge around it, the whole somewhat wider and more pronounced than the tops of Types 52 B-E. The filling-hole is pierced in the middle of this plain top, without any surrounding groove or ridge. There is always a vertical band handle, sometimes grooved; never a lug of any sort. The decoration of the upper parts of the lamp is notable, composed of very broad convex tongues alternating with slim parallel ribs, the latter sometimes ornamented with a cable pattern. At the top of every tongue, forming a decorative circle around the discus, is a small nodule or petal. At the root of the nozzle, included in the circle of nodules, are two miniature spirals in relief, facing each other. The nozzles are always plain with gently rounded tops. The usual termination is a wide oval one with a little flat band around the large wick-hole. This kind of nozzle has been seen rarely in the past. It was first introduced with Type 49 A, where it was a reflection of a metal prototype; most bronze lamps of the late Hellenistic and Roman periods bear this kind of swollen oval nozzle. A variant nozzle termination, used also with the plain rounded shank, is the pointed variety which has been seen so often on contemporary lamps. Here one finds the usual impressed circles, one on either side of the wick-hole and another circle at the tip. The third circle is not usually seen on preceding types, and here it is seen only in a well preserved mould. These impressed circles presumably represent vestigial rivets, which in some forgotten metal ancestor were used to attach the upper part of the moulded nozzle to its lower section. The clay is Attic and the glaze comparable to that of contemporary types; on some lamps it is a fairly good black to brown glaze all over; on a few it is a thin reddish wash, carelessly applied to the lower surfaces. Two lamps are signed. One bears the broken-barred alpha in relief, which has been seen already on Type 52 H, and which will be fairly common on other lamps of the second quarter of the 1st century after Christ. Another is signed with an incised signature, IN or N I, presumably the latter; this very likely represents the first two letters of a name otherwise unknown among lamp-makers in Athens at this time. 757 (L 3949).

TYPE 54 A EARLY ROMAN: GARLAND OF OLIVE LEAVES AND BERRIES; LONG GROOVED NOZZLES Nos. 762-771 (and 15 others inventoried). Plates 25, 26, 52. Corinth: classified under Type XVIII. From early 1st century B.C. to early years of 1st century after Christ. Type 54 A is a very popular early Roman group that was among the first to be made in Athens after the Sullan destruction of 86 B.c. There is no certain trace of this unique form before the sack of Athens. The pattern may have been introduced by a Roman prototype, perhaps a metal one, but it was taken up immediately and enthusiastically by the local fabricants, all of whom have Greek names when they appear as signatures. Perhaps the decorative pattern is significant, an olive wreath that would commemorate a new era of peace, although a bitter one for the Athenians. The olive wreath might also recall to the Athenians in a chauvinistic way the symbol of their goddess and their agricultural wealth that had been one of the foundations of Athenian economy. The olive also suggests the source of the oil burned in the lamp. The base is either oval or almond-shaped. The earlier lamps have the former, appearing as a kind of base-ring or a raised oval that is slightly concave. The later lamps have the latter formation, where the base usually appears as slightly raised with a concavity, but sometimes as a plain flat almond. These distinctions in the base are the only means of separating the earlier lamps in the group from the later ones. In every other respect there is no morphological change during the century that Type 54 A flourished. The sides are double-convex; there is usually a flat vertical band handle; there is no lug. The nozzle formation is the distinguishing characteristic of Type 54 A. It is long and pointed, sloping sharply downward on the sides from a narrow flat top occupied by a single flaring groove which spreads out toward the wick-hole. At its end the groove becomes a triangular flat area bordered by its side ridges. There are two impressed dots either side of the wick-hole. At the start of the nozzle are three raised pellets, the central one heading the main groove, the two side pellets heading groups of three narrow ridges that separate the nozzle from the decorated body of the lamp, in a well articulated way. An occasional lamp, as 770, substitutes the three ridges of Types 52 B-E for the single flaring groove, but maintains the three pellets and their adjacent ridges. The under sides of all the nozzles are angular rather than rounded. The filling-hole occupies most of the small flat center, which is surrounded by a narrow ridge. The flat center may sometimes be perceptibly wider, as on Types 52 B-E, and here the ridge around it becomes a wide flat band. The top of the lamp is embellished with a carefully moulded open wreath of olive leaves and berries, starting from a knot under the handle and symmetrically arranged on either side to the ends, adjacent to the nozzle. This is the first appearance of an olive wreath on Athenian lamps, although somewhat similar garlands of other leaves are familiar decorations in the repertory of</page><page sequence="202">196 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS earlier Hellenistic lamps and will be the main characteritic of the Roman Type 55. A few lamps are enclosed by wide handmade flaring collars to receive any spilled oil, with two or three useful drain-holes for returning the oil to the reservoir. The clay is Attic, but in the later lamps it is brittle and more apt to be buff than pink; the fine pinkish buff varieties of Attic clay common in Greek and Hellenistic lamps and pottery is seldom seen in fabrics made locally after the early years of the 1st century B.C. The lamps are glazed inside and outside with a thin glaze usually fired red or brownish black. A single lamp may be questionable; 771 has a thick very flaky clay that resembles Samian wares, although the clay could be a variant Attic ware. The names of several fabricants appear on the lamps. Heras signed one, in the genitive; the letters are in relief that read in the right direction, showing that they were carefully incised in the mould retrograde. In the same manner Aineias (or Aineios) signed another lamp. These two signatures show that lamp manufacturers were taking deliberate pains, as Ariston had done a generation or two earlier with his Type 51 B's, to present their trade-names legibly and boldly, rather than with incised or retrograde names. The competition was keen in the later years of the 1st century B.c.; some individual craftsmen seem to have taken pride in their work and to have been alert to the values of a recognized name. Heras does not appear as a fabricant of other lamps, but Aineias (or Aineios) has signed a number of examples of various 1st century B.C. types, either with the genitive case of his name or with its first two letters. The signature ATTOA appears once, in relief but retrograde, with the inference that this may be either for Apollonides or for Apollonios, both of them known previously. One catalogued lamp, 768, and two uncatalogued examples all bear the cryptic TTA, incised on the lamp itself when leather-hard, but with a small pi and a large alpha. This is the same signature seen on Type 52 E and it will appear again on some fragmentary bases. The lamp with thick flaky clay, 771, is signed by Sopatros who had carefully incised his mould retrograde to produce neat raised letters reading in the correct manner. This is his normal way of signing, as his other signatures show. Since Sopatros' other productions are all of Attic clay it is possible that this lamp may be of an unusual local fabric rather than an importation. 762 (L 2698). H. 0.035 m.; W. 0.057 m.

TYPE 54 B EARLY ROMAN: GARIAND OF OLIVE OR IVY LEAVES; CONCAVE TOP AND SHORT PLAIN NOZZLE Nos. 772-775 (and 5 others inventoried). Plate 52. Corinth: classified under Type XVIII. Later 1st century B.C. through early years of 1st century after Christ. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 50 B and 52 H, and on the finding places. This easily recognized group is unusual among Roman lamps of this period in that the bases are always circular. They are flat and raised, when the olive wreath decoration is used, flat with a thin, finely moulded base-ring when the ivy wreath appears on the top. There is no suggestion of the almond-shaped base seen on the preceding type, although occasionally the raised flat circle may have a suggestion of an oval contour. This, however, is due more to careless workmanship in the mould than to intent. There is always a fairly thick vertical band handle. The top or discus is pronouncedly concave, with a deep groove around it, as on Types 50 B and 52 H. The nozzle also is like those of these preceding types; it is short, triangular, with a narrow plain flat top. There is always an impressed dot either side of the wick-hole. The decoration of the upper sides is a wreath, either a counterpart of the garland of olive</page><page sequence="204">198 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS leaves and berries that appeared on Type 54 A, or a delicate garland of small heart-shaped ivy leaves arranged in groups of three. There is no chronological distinction between these two kinds of vegetation. All of the lamps bearing the ivy wreath are of exactly the same size and came from the same mould. They are the short-lived product of a single shop, but it is impossible to date them closely within the type. A few lamps have the familiar broad flaring collar added to collect spilled oil, together with the requisite drain-holes. The clay is thin, sometimes brittle, and can be Attic. The lamps are glazed all over with a fairly thin black or red or reddish brown coating.

These lamps, like those of Type 54 A, were also among the first to be made in Athens after the city had recovered from the invasion of Sulla. They are remarkably homogeneous. There is always a circular base; here it is slightly concave beneath so that the effect is that of a base- ring. There is always a small concave top or discus bordered by a narrow ridge, always a rather broad vertical band handle. No lugs ever appear. The nozzle is characteristically long and pointed with an impressed circle on either side of the wick-hole. The shank of the nozzle is curved but rises to a suggestion of a ridge down its center; it has a somewhat similar angular profile on its under side. No moulded or incised decoration appears on the nozzle; its ridge is so slight that on lamps coming from worn moulds it is imperceptible. The moulded decoration of the upper parts of the bodies is always a garland of leaves. This may be of laurel or olive leaves, but without the olives that are seen on Types 54 A and B as</page><page sequence="205">TYPE 54 D 199 accompaniments of their foliage. The other garland design is of small heart-shaped ivy leaves, like those seen on Type 54 B. In all cases the garland starts with a center under the handle area and falls symmetrically around either side, leaving a small vacant space at the start of the nozzle. The clay seems to be a fairly firm Attic fabric; the black or reddish glaze, although sometimes badly flaked, was carefully applied to the lamps, all over the outside but sparsely within. Two fabricants' names are known. Ion, who signed two examples of Type 52 A, is known by one signature here. His name appears in the genitive, in relief but retrograde, since it had been incised in the mould in the correct left-to-right manner. Another lamp bears in relief the first two letters of Dionysios' name. 776 (L 1824). Pl. 52. H. 0.034 m.; W. 0.057 m. Intact except for handle. Garland of veined laurel or olive leaves.

Plates 25, 52. 1st century after Christ; first and into second quarters. These few late lamps show the last version of the wreath design before it passed into obscurity, in favor of new Italian types with large decorated centers. Type 54 D is crisp and brittle; its circular base is like its predecessor's, but completely flat and sometimes outlined by a thin circular ridge. The top is broad and flat, or at least intended to be flat; the top is sur- rounded by a high ridge. This emphasis on the central part or discus is a characteristic of lamps made well within the 1st century after Christ and connects them stylistically with the new Italian models that were beginning to be popular at this time. The handles tend to be thin and narrow, often grooved down the center as on many other lamps of the second quarter of the 1st century after Christ. The relief decoration is on the rather narrow shoulders, the upper part of the lamp that is not occupied by the plain discus. Here is seen a variety of wreath designs, not so well modelled as</page><page sequence="206">900 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS those of Types 54 A-C, but all associated with the laurel leaf or the olive leaf with berries. No example of Type 54 D seems to utilize the ivy wreath seen on Type 54 C. The nozzles are long and broad. The one well-preserved nozzle shows a flat raised platform around the wick-hole, without the customary impressed circles. The shank of the nozzle is gently rounded without decoration and without the ridge seen on the preceding type. The under parts of the nozzle are also rounded rather than angular. One lamp has a curious added decoration on its lower sides, a series of six raised motifs that were impressed into the mould with a stamp or poin9on and represent the Isis symbol, a sistrum. One need not assume an Egyptian provenance for the lamp, since such a symbol simply reflects the increasing importance of the Isis cult in cosmopolitan centers of the Roman world during this period. The thin brittle red clay can be Attic. The thin glaze or wash is black to red and was applied all over the exteriors of the lamps.

TYPE 55 A EARLY ROMAN: IMBRICATED LEAF DECORATION; SMALL CONCAVE ToP AND LONG PLAIN NOZZLE No. 788. Plate 53. Ca. second quarter of 1st century B.C. to end of century. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 54 C. The use of a circle of triangular leaves as moulded decoration has been seen as early as the 3rd century B.C. on Type 46 B. It has also appeared on Type 48 C, and in tiers forming an imbricated pattern on Types 51 B and C of the late Hellenistic period down to 86 B.c. It now continues in the post-Sullan epoch. Although only one example of Type 55 A is preserved in the Agora collections it forms a recognizable type by itself, the counterpart in many ways of the more numerous examples of Type 54 C; it is not a variant, but the transitional step between the late Hellenistic versions of the imbricated pattern and those produced in quantity around the turn of the era. The base is circular, slightly raised and concave, giving the effect of a base-ring. The top is small and concave, bordered by a pronounced circular ridge. The nozzle is wide and without decoration; a slight ridge appears along the top of its shank and another down the under side of its projection. There is a fairly wide vertical band handle. In all of these respects Type 55 A is exactly like Type 54 C and thus must have been made during the same years, perhaps by the same fabricants. The termination of the nozzle on the single existing example is angular, but the tip is gently rounded rather than pointed. The preserved tips of Type 54 C are pointed, but rounded tips could have existed on some of their broken nozzles. The relief decoration of Type 55 A is carefully executed, with two circles of delicately modelled veined leaves, the upper tier overlapping the lower. The circles of leaves are complete, extending around the entire lamp as the garlands do on Type 54 C; there is no break on either side of the nozzle.</page><page sequence="208">209 THE ATHENIAN AGORA: GREEK LAMPS The clay is Attic and the glaze, although worn, a deep black and carefully applied all over the lamp. 788 (L 318).

Last years of 1st century B.C. to well into first quarter of 1st century after Christ. The base is always circular, raised perceptibly, and flat. The usual lamp has a groove around the outer periphery of the base, but very occasionally this is missing. The top is inevitably concave with a pronounced grooved ridge surrounding it; the vertical band handle is fairly broad and thick, unlike the slimmer handles characteristic of lamps of the late first and second quarters of the 1st century after Christ. The upper parts of the sides are decorated with regular rows of tiny overlapping leaves, arranged in an imbricated manner. On lamps that may be late within the type or on lamps from worn moulds the leaf-pattern appears as rows of small diamonds. The nozzles are fairly long with triangular ends, where there is an impressed dot on either side of the wick-hole. The shafts of the nozzles always bear parallel grooves or ridges that flare out at the wick-hole. The usual lamp has three such ridges, the two outer ones turning back on themselves in a volute-like manner, the central ridge broadening into a flat tongue. A variant design on 793 has a pair of grooves that flare out and then are bent around to outline the wick-hole area. The fairly heavy fabric is Attic. The glaze or thin wash varies in color and in application; on some lamps it is applied all over, but on a large number the coating is carelessly applied, appearing only in dribbles on the lower portions. One lamp is incised with the signature of Dionysios, already known as a fabricant of this period. Another bears a very faint incised signature that is undecipherable. 789 (L 3984). Pl. 53.

These are the late degenerate manifestations of Type 55 B, and are analogous to and con- temporary with Type 52 H (the late descendant of Type 52 G) and Type 54 D (a similar continuation of Type 54 B). The bases, insofar as they are preserved, are circular or somewhat oval, either slightly raised and flat or depressed with a small concavity. The top is the chief characteristic of the type. It is noticeably flat and always surrounded by a thick high ridge, as on Type 54 D. The upper part of the sides that bears the moulded decoration is comparatively narrow, thus restricting the imbricated leaf pattern to a decorative border. The leaves of the pattern have lost most of their foliate character and appear sometimes as rows of diamonds or even of angular dots. The nozzle formations are missing on most of the lamps, but enough remains to indicate that they were pointed, as those of Types 52 H and 54 D; some may have been rounded on top. One well preserved nozzle, that of 794, has a long channel on its top enclosed by two parallel ridges that are continuations of the ridge around the discus. This lamp and one other have added collars and drain-holes. The handle formations are thin and narrow, sometimes with a vertical groove which is typical of work in the first half of the 1st century after Christ, after its opening years. The clay is a rather thin coarse fabric, pink to buff, certainly Attic. The glaze is thin and reddish, usually applied evenly all over but sometimes with the familiar careless dribbling seen on Type 52 H and other contemporary lamps.

Last years of 1st century B.C. into first quarter of 1st century after Christ. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Type 55 B; the finding place of 798 is helpful. Type 56 A has the same basic shape as Type 55 B as well as a fairly close relationship in its moulded decoration. The base is circular, flat, and slightly raised with a groove around it. The top is pronouncedly concave, surrounded by a heavy grooved ridge or occasionally by a deep groove used alone. The vertical handle is wide and thick. The nozzle formation normally follows the established pattern with three parallel ridges, of which the outer two flare back into volute formations and the central one ends in a narrow tongue; there are the usual impressed dots either side of the wick-hole on its pronouncedly triangular termination. An occasional lamp has a pair of flaring ridges on the top of the nozzle with a flat area between, unadorned by a tongue or other device. The moulded decoration shows a pattern of large ribbed and pointed tongues, alternating with slim ribbed panels. Sometimes these motifs are close together, sometimes not, but always there is an imbricated leaf design between them, appearing as a background. As on Type 55 B, the leaf pattern usually devolves into small angular dots or even into tiny circles. Sometimes the central strips in both tongues and panels are jewelled with more tiny round dots. Normally the lamp has five tongues around its upper part but in a few cases only three. Jewelled tongues are a familiar late Hellenistic motif on Megarian bowls, but the combination of these with a background pattern of imbricated leaves has not been seen before its use on these lamps around the turn of the era. Type 56 A is made of local clay with the familiar red or black glaze, applied all over, which is characteristic of this early Roman period in Athens. None bears a signature. This is a fairly sizable group with a number of minor varieties within the moulded decorations, so it would seem that they were produced by more than one shop and probably over a period of several decades. 797 (L 2007).

Late 1st century B.C. into early 1st century after Christ. Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 52 H and 54 B, and on the finding place of 801. This group seems to be of about the same period as Type 56 A, although there is a pro- nounced change in the nozzle which here is undecorated on its flat triangular top. There is the usual pointed termination and an impressed circle on either side of the wick-hole. This nozzle formation, as well as the deeply concave top with a groove around it, rather than a ridge, is characteristic of Types 52 H, and 54 B. The base is circular, slightly raised and flat. One base has the groove around it seen on the preceding type, another is plain. The usual thick vertical handle is seen; there may or may not be an enveloping flaring collar with the requisite pair of drain-holes. The decorated top is generally like that of Type 56 A; there are always alternating ridged tongues and panels. The imbricated leaf design, however, is used more capriciously; in both of the catalogued examples it is omitted in two interstices. One lamp leaves these areas blank, another example fills them with crosses and dots that were incised in the soft clay of the lamp after it came out of the mould. The clay and red or black glaze are similar to those of the parent, Type 56 A, although one lamp has a thin black wash very sparingly applied to the under sides. No lamps are signed. 800 (L 3125).

Plates 26, 53. 1st century B.c., between its second quarter and the earliest years of 1st century after Christ. Dating based on some stylistic similarities to Type 55 B and on the finding places. This small group of lamps exhibits a boukranion design that never became so popular as the preceding arrangements of leaves, garlands, rays, etc. The documented examples seem to show that they were all made at one place, Athens, at about one time, possibly the late third quarter of the 1st century B.c. It is conceivable, however, that the motif of garlanded boukrania began earlier, in the period just before Sulla. Similar devices are seen occasionally on late Megarian bowls, and they may have appeared for a short time on lamps, to be revived in the later years of the 1st century B.C. when pottery and lamps were again manufactured in quantity in Athens. The base and top are like those of Type 55 B; the former is a slightly raised flat circle with a groove around it; the latter is markedly concave with a grooved ridge around it. The handle formation is stout and usually of the vertical band variety. 805 has an exceptional basket handle that bridges the top of the lamp from back to front. The moulded decoration on the upper sides consists of a series of five boukrania garlanded with a wool fillet tied so as to resemble bead and reel; at each side of every boukranion depends a bell-shaped tassel and between the boukrania are rosettes. The long pointed nozzle interrupts the moulded design. Although no nozzle is completely preserved there is sufficient evidence to show that it would be like that of Type 55 B. There are three parallel ridges, the central one ending in a tongue at the wick-hole. The two side ridges would end in volute scrolls. The fabric is heavy, again resembling that of Type 55 B, and the glaze is red or reddish brown all over. One lamp was inscribed while the clay was still soft with the name of the maker, Dionysios, who also produced at least one example of Type 55 B.</page><page sequence="213">TYPE 58 A 207 804 (L 2699).

Dating based on stylistic similarities to Types 50 A and B, and on the finding place of 806. This very small group was initiated shortly before the sack of Athens in 86 B.c.; it was revived soon afterwards and had a brief floruit well within the bounds of the Ist century B.c. There is a slightly raised circular base, somewhat concave rather than flat. The sides are high, curving up to a flat circular top encircled by a thick ridge. This feature as well as the nozzle formation recalls Type 52 E which begins toward the end of Type 58 A's period. The tips of the nozzles are not preserved, but the long shafts have the three parallel ridges that are seen not only on Type 52 E but on many other varieties of 1st century B.C. lamps. There is the usual thick vertical band handle. The moulded decoration on the upper sides consists of a series of large rosettes alternating with broad heart-shaped leaves. Such rosettes were familiar motifs on late Hellenistic lamps. The leaves are of the same size and shape seen on Types 50 A and B, and certainly derive from them. If it were not for their pronouncedly flat tops these lamps might indeed be classed as a sub-type of the Knidos group. The clay is a well worked pinkish buff Attic fabric; there is a liberal use of glaze all over, either orange-red or black. Both of the Agora specimens came from the same moulds, but their glazes were fired differently. 806 (L 2934). P1. 53. H. 0.041 m.; W. 0.069 m. Intact except for end of nozzle and chips from body.

Plates 95, 28, 54. 1st century after Christ, second and third quarters principally, but on to 2nd century after Christ. Dating based on some stylistic similarities to Types 44 D and 54 D, and on the finding places. In the early and middle years of the 1st century after Christ a few craftsmen sporadically turned out lamps that were not members of recognizable groups or families, but were rather individual creations. These have all been brought into Type 58 B because they have in common the same general period and the same decorative motif, a rosette or the simplification of a rosette that may be termed a pellet. This circular device may be used alone or in combination with other devices; no two lamps in Type 58 B have exactly the same decoration, so a description of the several treatments is reserved for the discussions of the individual lamps below. In most cases the decoration is carefully moulded, but on two lamps, 811 and 813, which are probably late within the type, the devices are very crudely made, reflecting a real decline in craftsmanship in this particular group of early Roman lamps. Another element common to all lamps of Type 58 B is a broad plain discus, flat or very slightly concave, bordered by a high ridge as on Types 44 D and 54 D. All lamps were equipped with rather thin high vertical handles that are occasionally grooved, typical of many other lamps of this epoch. Another feature shared by all members of Type 58 B is the nozzle treatment. The shank is never grooved nor ribbed as on lamps of a generation or two earlier; it may have a narrow flat top on the same plane as the discus' surrounding ridge, again as on Type 44 D; or the shank may have a slight ridge down its length or be gently rounded. The shank never bears any decoration except in the case of 814, where the main decoration of the lamp is continued on top of the nozzle. The tip of the nozzle is pointed, but usually with a blunt point made by two converging arcs rather than two straight lines meeting at the tip. The wick-hole is centered in a flat platform that is set off from the curved sides of the nozzle's shank. Aside from the variations in the moulded decoration, lamps of Type 58 B differ in their bases which may be flat and circular surrounded by a ridge, like a miniature base-ring, or flat and almond-shaped. In several cases the bases are not sufficiently preserved to show whether or not they followed either of these two schemes. The clay also varies, from the thin rather brittle fabric of 808 to the heavy bulk of 811. There is nothing in between; both of these varieties of clay have already been seen in lamps of the first century after Christ. The glaze varies from black to reddish brown to red, evenly applied all over. The sloppy application of glaze seen on some lamps around the turn of the era is not evident here. One lamp, 814, is a curious creation. This was never actually used as a lamp since there is no wick-hole and the filling-hole is represented by a very narrow insertion. This is a workshop piece, clearly demonstrating the presence of local manufacture. It was made in two moulds but seems nearly solid within; the solid nozzle shows that it is not an unfinished lamp. The white coating or slip covering its exterior suggests that it may be a matrix for moulds. If a matrix, however, it was made itself from two moulds. Its clay is a fine pinkish buff that is normally associated with Attica. An actual matrix has been seen before, 630 of Type 48 A, but this was made on the wheel</page><page sequence="215">TYPE 58 B 209 and finished by hand. It would be safe to call the present lamp, 814, a trial piece made from moulds that were not yet finished or were in the process of further refining; it may be noted that the relief decoration that came out of impressions in the mould is not symmetrical, nor are the usual outlines present that normally were cut in the mould to mark the wick-hole, at least, if not the filling-hole.'" It is very likely that this lamp was never fired. The clay rubs off very easily where it is exposed under the white coating; this coating itself was presumably applied to the soft clay of the object after emergence from the mould to facilitate handling without having to wait for the firing. The lamp is well preserved today, in spite of having been perhaps only sun-baked, thanks to this white integument. Two makers' marks are seen on Type 58 B. The familiar broken-barred alpha appears twice, on lamps that are similar in most respects and probably came from the same factory; they were also found together in the debris of one household. The other mark is a ligature rather than a letter, appearing in relief on two lamps very much alike, and resembling a delta with an iota down its center. This may be a symbol adopted during these years by the fabricant named Dionysios or his successors. It will be seen occasionally on other products of the middle decades of the 1st century after Christ. 808 (L 2970). Pls. 25, 54. H. 0.031 m.; W. 0.069 m.

Second half of 2nd century B.C. into third quarter of 1st century after Christ. These fragmentary bases preserve none of the characteristic upper portions of the lamps that would permit them to be assigned to specific types. In a few cases one might hesitantly deduce the type of the lamp from the signature, as in the case of Hephaistion who at present is known only for his signatures on Type 48 C; the several bases here that are signed by him have the shape, clay, and glaze of Type 48 C and probably belong to that type. In most cases, however, there is some possibility that the fragmentary base may belong to one of several catalogued types or to a variant or to a type not completely preserved or represented in the Agora inventory. The bases are described briefly in the catalogue, with suggestions in some cases as to the probable type or types to which they may belong. When there is additional evidence for dating, that is given along with the catalogue description. Most of the fabricants who have been seen on lamps of known types, between Types 44 A and 58 Variants, are represented among the names on the fragmentary bases. A few names occur that have not appeared previously, and there are several ligatures and initials that cannot easily be associated with any of the familiar names. It is possible to assemble some scraps of information concerning the dates of a number of the fabricants whose names appear more than once. In recapitulation one can see clearly that some flourished during specific periods; any scrap of lamp that may turn up with a signature of one of these men can thus be assigned to his floruit, whether the top design of the lamp is known or not. There is no clay nor glaze represented among these signed bases that need not be Attic. Many varieties of both are present, but the group contains no obvious importations. Paramonos remains then as the only fabricant represented in this collection who worked elsewhere and shipped his product, Type 49 A, into Athens. The few following names are those of Athenians whose careers can be dated more or less closely; no mention is made of those whose work or the work of whose shops extended over an average lifetime, nor of those whose work is represented by only a single type: Ariston and Hephaistion: flourished in the later years of the 2nd century B.c. and down to 86 B.c.; their work is not known after Sulla. Ion and Sopatros: flourished in the period after Sulla, but probably did not extend into the 1st century after Christ. Aineias (Aineios), Isidotos, Lysias (Lysios), and Proteas: flourished during the second half of the 1st century B.C. and into the early years of the 1st century after Christ.

Letters in relief, retrograde, running from nozzle end to handle in three lines: ATrOAjA ON IAIOY. Same shop as preceding, but almond-shaped base suggests date well after middle of 1st cen- tury B.C. Letters from a mould similar to that which produced 719 of Type 52 C. 848 (L 2858). P1. 26. Est. W. of base 0.070 m. Flat raised base, probably circular. Thick pinkish buff clay, worn black glaze. Letters in relief (probably in two lines): -TTOA-. For ATTO- AAO)NIAOY (same as preceding or ATTOAACONIOY (same as following). Large size and massive fabric suggest shop of 843-847 and a fairly early date in its floruit. 849 (L 4652). P1. 26. Est. W. of base 0.045 m. Concave base (circular, oval, or almond- shaped). Thin buff clay, worn brown glaze. Let- ters in relief in two lines: [ATTOAA]ICONIOY, His name is known on Type 52 E (735) and this signature may be assigned to the same date, ca. second half of 1st century B.c., since clay, glaze, and shape agree with those of Type 52 E. 850 (L 864). P1. 26. W. of base 0.047 m. Circular flat base with base-ring; concentric grooves in center. Traces of nozzle and handle. Thick pinkish buff clay, red glaze. Around the base, within the ring, neatly made letters in re- lief: APIETQN ; none missing. An unusual ex- ample of a signature in the nominative rather than the genitive. The same fabricant signed lamps of Type 51 B, during the late 2nd century, perhaps to 86 B.c. This base has the unusual features of the bases of Type 51 and possibly belongs to that type. 851 (L 1870). P1. 26. Est. W. of base 0.050 m. Shape like preceding, as well as clay and glaze. Letters are similarly arranged, in relief:[APIlTO]- N OE. Normal signature in the genitive for this manufacturer. Possibly a fragment of Type 51 B and to be dated accordingly. 852 (L 4718). Pl. 26. W. of base 0.038 m. Oval base, slightly concave. Part of nozzle at top. Thin buff clay, no trace of glaze or wash. Signature incised before firing: AC K AHTIIAAOY. Not duplicated on preceding types. The shape of base and character of incision suggest a date between middle of 1st century B.c. and early years of 1st century after Christ. 853 (L 4768). P1. 26. W. of base 0.038 m. Flat circular raised base. Pinkish buff clay, black to red glaze. Signature: AD; incised before firing, but retrograde, a most unusual occurrence. Cf. the fabricant TTA- (orATT- ?) of Types 52 E and 54 A and below. If this signature came out of the mould the letters would have read correctly there but would have been in relief. This im- plies that the matrix which produced the mould would have had the incised letters retrograde, the same as this lamp; the problem is the same. Let- ters presumably incised intentionally retrograde on the soft clay, for ACKAHTTIAAOY, as pre- ceding. The character of clay, glaze, and shape suggest a date a little earlier than preceding lamp. They could both have been produced ca. 50 B.C., how- ever. 854 (L 3752). P1. 26. Est. W. of base 0.032 m. Base like preceding but smaller. Thin clay, black glaze.

If this lamp and the two preceding are all from the same factory, it may have begun to flourish just before or just after Sulla's invasion and con- tinued for perhaps forty to fifty years, introducing new styles but withdrawing from production well before the end of the 1st century B.c. 855 (L 3768).

Letters in relief retrograde, in two lines: [F] AA [Y] K IO, genitive of Glaukias, the only ex- ample of this fabricant's name on a lamp; the name is well known in Athenian prosopography. Fabric and scraped ridge (cf. Type 48 A and others) suggest date in late 2nd century B.c. 856 (L 2014). P1. 26. W. of base 0.033 m. Concave almond-shaped base with suggestion of base-ring; part of nozzle preserved at top. Buff clay, flaky brown glaze. Signature in relief, retro- grade, in three lines: AHMIHTPI[IOY]. Same maker signed lamps of Type 50 B, which covers broad period including all of 1st century B.c. Almond-shaped base indicates a date certainly after Sulla. 857 (L 2056). Est. W. of base ca. 0.030 m. Small bit of flat almond-shaped base and entire under side of long nozzle, angular in section. Pinkish buff clay, worn black glaze. Signature in relief retrograde, in two or three lines: [A H M] H- TPI [IOY] exactly as preceding. Same date as preceding for same reasons. 858 (L 4915). P1. 26. W. of base 0.039 m. Flat circular raised base, part of nozzle pre- served at top. Buff clay, thin red to brown glaze carelessly applied. Signature incised in soft clay: AH; for AHMHTPIOY, as preceding. Shape and fabric suggests that this probably belongs to Type 50 B. 859 (L 46). W. of base 0.039 m. Flat circular raised base with groove around it. Pinkish buff clay, slight traces of brown glaze. Signature incised in soft clay in two lines: AIONIYCIOY, exactly as on 804 of Type 57. This well known fabricant signed many lamps of Types 52 E, 54 Variants, 55 B, and 57; this signature may thus be dated in the period be- tween middle of 1st century B.c. and first quarter of 1st century after Christ. Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 205-206, 213-214, L 46, fig. 11, 3, where it is called Broneer Type XXVII rather than Type XVIII. 860 (L 1560). P1. 26. W. of base 0.038 m. Circular flat base with base-ring; part of nozzle preserved at top. Pinkish buff clay, good black glaze. Letters in relief in two or three lines, the nu appearing backwards although the rest of name reads correctly left-to-right: AIO0J NYC II [OY]. Same maker as preceding. Shape and fabric indicate a date in the earliest years of his shop's production, probably somewhat before second quarter of 1st century B.c. 861 (L 2763). P1. 26. Est. W. of base ca. 0.040 m. Flat base with narrow ridge around it, circular or oval. Trace of nozzle at top. Pinkish buff clay, remains of poor red glaze. Letters in relief, prob- ably retrograde, to read: Z . . . AA . No lamp- maker known in this or other collections whose name would fit. A name such as Zoriades or Zariadres would fit, but no restoration is sug- gested. D 11; 1, well: dumped filling, late 1st century B.c. and early 1st century after Christ. 862 (L 2159). W. of base 0.040 m. Circular flat raised base; trace of nozzle at top. Pinkish buff clay, peeled black to red glaze. Sig- nature in relief retrograde: H4A I, for Hephais- tion (?) who signed Type 48 C. This lamp agrees in shape and fabric with Type 48 C and signature is exactly like that of 638. D 12: 2, cistern shaft: filling of late 2nd and early 1st centuries B.c. 863 (L 4090). P1. 26. W. of base 0.040 m. Base and bit of nozzle like preceding; same clay and glaze. Letters in relief retrograde: HQ, for Hephaistion (?) as preceding.

Single letter in relief: H, for Hephaistion (?) as pre- ceding, or possibly for Heras who signed Type 54 A. Form and fabric suggest Type 48 C and letter is exactly like H of 639 of Type 48 C; presumably Hephaistion was the maker, the lamp may be dated accordingly. 866 (L 4717). Pl. 27. W. of base 0.035 m. Raised oval base, concave; part of nozzle with angular underside preserved at top. Thin pinkish buff clay, worn black glaze. Signature in relief, retrograde: OYP, incised in the mould almost cursively. Not duplicated on preceding types. The only known definitely Attic name that could be restored is Thyrbaios; one lived ca. 1st cen- tury B.C. There are, however, many names begin- ning with OYP in general Greek prosopography; none known as a lamp-maker. Shape and fabric suggest date in 1st century B.C., after Sulla. 867 (L 2000). W. of base 0.034 m. Almond-shaped base, slightly concave; bit of nozzle preserved at top. Pinkish buff clay, dull red glaze badly peeled. Signature incised in three line ICIIAOTjIOY. This fabricant signed his whole name on Type 52 B, 711, exactly as here; IC1 appears on Types 52 C and 52 E; this lamp can fit stylistically into the floruit of these types, be- tween middle of Ist century B.c. and early years of 1st century after Christ. 868 (L 4381). Pl. 27. W. of base 0.038 m. Slightly raised flat base, perhaps almond- shaped. Clay and glaze like preceding. Signature incised in three lines: [ICI] AOITOY Same fabricant as preceding; lamp to be dated as preceding for stylistic reasons. (Signature might be restored as LOEO]AOTOY, but no lamp- maker known in this period by that name). 869 (L 1796). Pl. 27. Est. W. of base 0.030 m. Flat almond-shaped base with bit of nozzle. Pinkish buff clay, dull black glaze. Signature in relief, from nozzle end to handle end: ICIA [OTOY]. Same fabricant as on preceding two lamps. Al- though IC IA[(OPOY] would be a permissible resto- ration, no Isidoros is known in this period as a lamp fabricant. Shape and fabric suggest date early in maker's period, probably not after middle years of 1st century B.C. 870 (L 2188). P1. 27. W. of base 0.046 m. Circular raised base, very concave. Pinkish buff clay, good black glaze. Well made letters in re- lief, could be retrograde or not: It1; for IEIAOTO Y or IEIAMPOY; presumably the former, as on pre- ceding. Shape and fabric require a date as early as that of preceding; perhaps earlier, in the 1st century B.c. just before Sulla. If this is true, the early years of the shop must be pushed back half a century. 871 (L 4528). P1. 27. Est. W. of base 0.040 m. Fragment of raised circular base, concave. Thin pinkish buff clay, worn black glaze. Signature in relief retrograde: [I] O NO [C]. This fabricant signed lamps of Types 52 A and 54 C during the first century B.C., between its second quarter and the earliest years of 1st cen- tury after Christ. This fragment can be assigned for stylistic reasons to this period, in its earlier rather than later years. 872 (L 2745). P1. 27. W. of base 0.046 m. Circular flat raised base. Buff clay, thick black glaze. Letters in relief retrograde: A Y, for the AY.IOY of Types 52 C and 52 G (?). Shape and fabric suggest a date earlier than Types 52 C and G, perhaps as early as late 2nd century B.c. 873 (L 1974). Pl. 27. W. of base 0.046 m. Almond-shaped base, slightly concave. Pinkish buff clay, metallic black glaze. Letters in relief, probably retrograde: AY, for A Y. OY mentioned on preceding. Almond-shaped base permits this lamp to be dated within the floruit of Lysias/-os or Lykios.</page><page sequence="225">SIGNED BASES 219 874 (L 4851). W. of base 0.030 m. Flat oval base, almost almond-shaped. Pinkish buff clay, worn dull red glaze. Incised letters in soft clay: TTA, the pi much smaller than the alpha. The same signature seen on Types 52 E and 54 A. The lamp can be easily dated during the era of Types 52 E and 54 A, presumably during the second half of the 1st century B.c., on stylistic grounds. 875 (L 3658). W. of base 0.030 m. Slightly raised oval base, concave. Part of noz- zle preserved with rounded lower section. Same clay, glaze, and signature as preceding: TTA. Same date as preceding. 876 (L 373). Est. W. of base ca. 0.030 m. Base, clay, glaze, and signature like preceding: TTA. Same date as preceding. 877 (L 2132). W. of base 0.034 m. Almond-shaped concave base. Part of lower portions of nozzle, angular in section. Pinkish buff clay, worn black glaze. Signature incised in soft clay: 1TPOTEOY. This fabricant signed lamps of Type 52 B with his whole name and of Type 52 C with its first three letters. This lamp is presumably either 52 B or 52 C and to be dated accordingly. The signature is exactly like that of 708 of Type 52 B. 878 (L 1789). P1. 28. W. of base 0.065 m. Circular raised base, slightly concave. Pinkish buff clay, black glaze. Signature incised: TTP, for TTPQTEOY, as on preceding lamp. Shape and size suggest a date early in Proteas' career, as on preceding lamp, earlier than Types 52 B and 52 C, to neither of which could this lamp belong. This lamp produced shortly before or shortly after 86 B.c. 879 (L 4847). P1. 28. W. of base 0.036 m. Almond-shaped base, slightly concave. Trace of nozzle at top. Thin buff clay, dull black glaze. Signature in relief in two lines: CTQTAI [TP]O Y. Sopatros signed Types 44 A, 52 E and 54 A. This fragment can be assigned stylistically to the periods of Types 44 A, 52 E and 54 A although it probably cannot belong to any of them. A 14: 2, cistern chamber: context of 1st cen- tury after Christ. An inventoried example of Type 44 A also found here. 880 (L 1408). P1. 28. Est. W. of base ca. 0.036 m. Flat almond-shaped base with bit of lower, angular, portions of nozzle. Pinkish buff clay, red glaze. Signature in relief: CUTTA; the omega had been incised upside down, while the fabricant was cutting the signature in the mould retrograde. This fragment may belong to Type 52 E and may be dated accordingly. 881 (L 4571). Est. W. of base 0.035 m. Oval base with false ring foot; part of nozzle preserved at top. Pinkish buff clay, dull red glaze. Signature in relief in three lines CQITTAITPOY Stylistically related to preceding and to be dated similarly. Signature exactly like that of 731 of Type 52 E; cf. Plate 28. 882 (L 1860). P1.28. W. of base 0.040 m. Flat circular raised base. Pinkish buff clay, red glaze. Signature incised in soft clay in two lines: 41AOIMOCOY. This name not known on preced- ing types, but a fabricant by this name signs later Roman lamps (Corinth Type XXVII) in the second half of the 1st century after Christ. This fragment appears stylistically to be be- tween late 2nd and late 1st centuries B.c. 883 (L 3709). Pl. 28. W. of base 0.040 m. Base and fabric like preceding; dull black to brown glaze. Signature in relief: ; abbrevia- tion of preceding name. Clay, glaze, and shape suggest date like pre- ceding. 884 (L 1407). W. of base 0.036 m. Almond-shaped base with false ring foot.

Stylistically to be dated in the 1st century B.c., but after Sulla. 885 (L 4091). Pl. 28. W. of base 0.040 m. Almond-shaped base with false base-ring. Traces of nozzle with angular lower portion and bit of top with ray pattern in relief. Thin pinkish buff clay, dull brown glaze. Single letter in relief: 4, Probably initial of Philomousos. Suggested date same as preceding. 886 (L 2265). P1. 28. Est. W. of base 0.045 m. Wide circular raised base with a groove around it; pinkish buff clay, traces of red to brown glaze. Very slight traces of faintly incised signature: iTOC. No suggested restoration. Shape and fabric, as well as letters, imply a date after Sulla and before second quarter of 1st century after Christ. 887 (L 2086). Pl. 28. W. of base ca. 0.040 m. Slightly raised flat base, could be circular or oval or almond-shaped. Good pinkish buff clay, worn red glaze. Remains of signature in relief, retrograde, in more than one line: - OY. This could be the ending of one of several known fabri- cants' names. Suggested date in the 1st century B.c., but any- where between its beginning and end. 888 (L 5056). P1. 28. W. of base 0.035 m. Oval base, raised and slightly concave. Pinkish buff clay, flaked dull red glaze. Traces of nozzle and handle attachment. On base a monogram composed of several letters forming a device, in relief and retrograde. Letters include A, K, P, and T. Perhaps this indicates the name of a fabricant such as AKPATOZ. This name does not appear elsewhere as that of a lamp manufacturer. Possibly the device indicates prime quality, " un- mixed," and is allied to the alpha on lamps of the 1st century after Christ that may signify excel- lence (v. supra s. Type 44 D). Similar mono- grams or devices appear on Athenian coinage of 229-197 B.c., but not this. Shape and fabric imply a date certainly after the third quarter of the 2nd century B.c., perhaps after Sulla. 889 (L 2861). P1. 28. W. of base 0.033 m. Small circular base, concave with false ring foot. Thin pinkish buff clay, chipped black glaze. Re- mains of a monogram comparable to preceding, in relief and retrograde.

In addition to the deposits cited in the Catalogue for the dating of a given type, it includes a few others of special interest, including several excavated too late for inclusion in the text. The deposits are listed in alphabetical order by code numbers consisting of a letter and number combination. These refer to the 20-meter squares within the topographic survey now applied to the Agora area; see the plan, Plate 56. Serial numbers, set off from the code (or grid) number by a colon, serve to differentiate different deposits within a given square. A few extensive fillings, extending over several squares, have grid numbers only. Publication references in this list apply to a group or deposit as a whole, whether its discovery or the full or partial publication of its contents. Publication references for individual lamps are given in the Catalogue.
