<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION PARADIGM APPLIED TO THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF-NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION: CRITIQUE OF TAUBER'S PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS WILFRIED ALLAERTS SUMMARY. Biological self reference idioms in brain-centered or nervous-system-centered self determination of the consious Self reveal an interesting contrast with biological self determination by immunological self/non-self discrimination. This contrast is both biologi cal and epistemological. In contrast to the consciousness conscious of itself, the immunolog ical self-determination imposes a protective mechanism against self-recognition (Coutinho et al. 1984), which adds to a largely unconscious achievement of the biological Self (Popper 1977; Medawar 1959). The latter viewpoint is in contrast with the immunological Self determination as an essentially cognitive process as expressed in the analysis of Tauber (1994). Comparison of the immune system in vertebrates and invertebrates, according to new biological insights, has contributed to a better understanding of the relative role of innate (or inherited) immunity versus immunity acquired during each individual life. Also in this respect, immunological self-achievement shows both a striking analogy and a fundamental discrepancy with the activity of the nervous system. The analysis of immunological Self/non-self discrimination versus brain-centered self determination adds to the understanding of the function paradigm in biological self reference idioms, especially when regarding the importance of the connectivity notion in both systems. Adopting functional explanatory schemes for understanding immunolog ical self-non-self discrimination, as well as for the understanding of functional mapping of the brain at (conscious) activity (Friston et al. 1993; Frith et al. 1995), forwards the notion of effective/functional connectivity. Network connectivity not only is a primary question in solving the dimensionality question for immunological 'idiotypic networks' (Jerne 1974a, b; 1984), it may also have an important value in describing phase transitions in the development of both immune and nervous systems. Key words: biological function, immunological self/non-self discrimination, innate/acquired immunity, connectivity, Tauber 1. INTRODUCTION Following an orthodox Darwinistic logic, Richard Dawkins (1976) in his Journal for General Philosophy of Science 30: 155-171,1999. ? 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">156 WILFRIED ALLAERTS monograph The Selfish gene proclaimed the thesis that genes are the fun damental units of selfishness. This is explained by Dawkins by assuming that genes constitute the molecular ground substances of inheritance and natural selection. Natural selection includes the selection of behaviour and especially selfish behaviour, which according to Dawkins (ibidem) is found widespread in nature. Genes exist by themselves and only for themselves, according to Dawkins (ibidem), and this holds equally for coding and non coding regions of DNA. In Dawkins' terminology, their only function (or cause) may be defined in terms of their survival, or even more strictly, in terms of their selfishness. Rather than discussing Darwinism or Dawkins' extrapolation of the idea of natural selection to the genomic level, it is the conceptual link between the selfhood concept and the biological function notion or the notion of causation in biological systems which is at stake in the present paper. Although Dawkins' theory does not answer the question whether genes (or DNA) represent the formal or material cause of the resulting behaviour or effect - a formulation by Ji (1988) of the question of which Aristotelian categories apply to physical and especially biological process es, - it is clear that the primary role ascribed to the genes in Dawkins' work links the selfhood concept to the biological function notion and introduces a biological self-reference idiom at the genomic level. Also at the organ ismal level1, the selfhood concept indeed was related to the function of immunity by Tauber (1994)2. According to Tauber, the immune activity of the organism results from a developmental process of self-achievement by "defending the contours and/or the identity of the organism" (Tauber, ibidem, p. 139), similar to the process of conscious self-determination (see Section 2). Despite the many similarities drawn between the immune system and the nervous system (Coutinho et al. 1984; Ballieux 1994), it was empha sized by Coutinho (1980; 1984) that the activity of the immune system reflects a fundamentally different array of processes compared to the activ ity of the nervous system. In this paper we will first discuss the controversial positions with respect to self-achievement through immunity as a cogni tive process (Tauber 1994) versus an unconscious (Medawar 1959; Popper 1977) or even a non-cognitive process (Coutinho et al. 1984) (Section 3). Apart from the question whether the immune function of the organism should be regarded as a cognitive process or not, we will further address some new insights obtained from the comparison of immunity in verte brates versus invertebrates (Beck and Habicht 1991, 1996) - a question related to the comparison of the relative adaptive importance of acquired versus innate immunity. Also in Section 3, we will discuss the relevance of</page><page sequence="3">THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF-NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION 157 a so-called non-classical tolerance paradigm, as observed in mammalian skin (Nickoloff and Turka 1994; 1996), for the notion of tolerance induc tion is essential to the development of the selfhood concept in immunology (Tauber 1994; see also Section 2). The contrast between innate and acquired immunity raises the question of the importance of genetic inheritance versus life-time events that mod ulate biological processes, both leading into immunity3. Especially for the latter (acquired) form of immunity, the immune system indeed strikingly resembles the nervous system, representing a process of gradual self/non self discrimination upon contact with non-self. Also in agreement with the proposed analogy between immune and nervous system is the recently for warded connectivity notion as an important characteristic to describe the activity of the nervous system (Friston et al. 1993; Frith et al. 1995), anal ogous to the theory that acquisition of a mature immune defense system is accompanied by profound changes in the connectivity characteristics of the so-called idiotypic (immune) networks (Jerne 1974a; 1974b; 1984). We will analyse the importance of the connectivity notion in attempts to define the biological function of self/non-self discrimination in terms of mathematical networks (Jerne 1974a; 1974b; 1984) or in topological terms (Perelson 1989)4. 2. TAUBER AND THE THEORY/METAPHOR OF THE IMMUNE SELF (1994) Although it is not the aim of the present paper to review the total of ideas expressed in the monography by Alfred I. Tauber (1994) The Immune Self: Theory or Metaphor?, we will briefly summarize in this section the philosophical position of Tauber, being very explicit when referring to a typically biological self-reference idiom: the immune Self or immuno logical Self/non-self discrimination. As pointed out in Tauber's work, the term Self is not used in immunological literature prior to 1940, whereas the terms host, organism and individual are commonplace (Tauber 1994, 139). Moreover, though the latter terms may seem reasonable substitutes in many contexts, the Self as a metaphorical construction has a definite advantage, according to Tauber, because "immunity defines the Self rather than only defending the host/organism/individuality" (ibidem 139). The self/non-self terminology was formally introduced by Burnet and Fen ner (1949), but Tauber endorses a straight scientific lineage to the work of Metchnikoff (1982, 1901), showing explicit evidence that Burnet was sympathetic to, and knowledgeable of Metchnikoff's vision (Tauber ibid., 97). At the origin of the Metchnikoff-Burnet lineage of immunological con</page><page sequence="4">158 WILFRIED ALLAERTS cepts and thoughts, according to Tauber, lies the Metchnikovian (1892, 1901) concept of the phagocyte5. The phagocyte cell type is regarded as the vehicle used by the host organism to strive for 'internal harmony' against invasive and possibly pathogenic organisms. By engulfing particles and micro-organisms and killing the ingested cells, the phagocyte partici pates in a Darwinian competition between cell lineages, and so it becomes the principal effector of the self-achievement of the host (Tauber 1994, 18-19). Metchnikoff 's theory was agressively attacked by German micro biologists, accusing him of teleology and vitalism. In attempt to defy these accusations in his Paris lecture of 1981, Metchnikoff (1892) subsumed the vitalistic principle of the phagocyte under the autonomous behaviour of organisms, and, by doing so he constructed an evolutionary connection between the 'freedom' of the phagocyte, the volition of primitive organisms and the precursors of mind and free will (Tauber, ibid., 59). However, among the pivotal scientific questions and problems that immunology still had so solve by then, were the questions (i) how to gener ate diversity and specificity (Jerne 1974 a,b) of the immune defense against foreign (possibly but not necessarily pathogenic) antigens, and (ii) the prob lem of tolerance towards antigens of the own. In an elaborated review of the development of these questions during the 20th century history of immunology, Tauber demonstrates the pioneering role played by Frank Macfarlane Burnet (1941, 1949, 1959, 1969) in solving these questions. It was particularly in the course of these scientific debates between Burnet and contemporary immunologists that the selfhood concept emerges in immunology, as an underlying principle to solve the problem of tolerance (Tauber, ibid., 83). Burnet (1941) introduced the selfhood concept as he raised fundamental biological concerns against the template theory6 of antibody formation originally proposed by Bail and co-workers (Bail and Tsuda 1909). Later on the selfhood concept was explicitly formulated by Burnet and Fenner (1949). However, many immunologists still opposed the introduction of this notion, being too nebulous or belonging to a so-called ill-defined philosophical jargon (e.g. Flew 1949; fide Tauber, ibid.). Also Jerne (1974b) avoided the term Self, using the more neutral term idiom (Tauber, ibid. 128) (see also Section 4). A central viewpoint in Tauber's book is that "the Self has emerged in the 20th century as an operative metaphor for orienting immunity in terms of both the source of its activity and the object of its function. (...) The term Self is borrowed from the philosophical discourse to denote concerns about the source of immune activity, that is the identity problem" (Tauber, ibid., 141). Tauber is well aware of the fact that the Self remains an elusive concept, although generally shared throughout culture, a characteristic which it</page><page sequence="5">THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF-NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION 159 shares with terms as mind, ego, soul, consciousness and psyche. However, according to Tauber (ibid., 141), "two broad boundaries or criteria of an organismically based notion of selfhood are defined by the intuitions of embodiment and of interaction." We previously referred to Tauber's adherence to the phenomenological attitude, and especially to its manifestation in the philosophy of Edmund Husserl (1913) (see Allaerts 1996, subm.). The latter citation of Tauber (1994, 142) shows a clear affinity with the viewpoint of interactionism between the Self and the brain (Popper and Eccles 1977), although not referred in Tauber's monography. In the present paper we will not discuss the adherence of Tauber to the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche (1904), who's vision of individuality and biologicism, marked by "an enormous preoccupation with the body and disease, both as metaphor and as object" (Tauber, ibid., 249), has a great impact in Tauber's analysis. To conclude from the present section, we may, with some nuance, sit uate Tauber's analysis within the broad 20th century phenomenological tradition. Moreover, as we discuss in the following section, Tauber's view point as an essentially cognitive function contrasts with other viewpoints on the immunological Self/non-self discrimination (e.g. Coutinho et al. 1984). 3. IS THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF/NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION A COGNITIVE FUNCTION? According to Tauber's evolving model of an immunological identity that alters its previous identity upon each challenge with pathogens, a strik ing analogy with the evolving model of developmental, phylogenetic or cognitive-emotional self-achievement may be drawn (Tauber, ibid., 58). However, according to Coutinho et al. (1984), the immune system - and it is the 'acquired' immunity which is meant here - illustrates a strictly dis tinct idiom of self-determination than the nervous system. Indeed, rather than a consciousness being conscious of itself, the immune system pro vides a self-reference system, in which the (biological or immunological) Self is protected from improper recognition (Coutinho et al. 1984), and as a consequence Self and non-self are discriminated. To cite Coutinho et al. (ibidem, 152): "(the immune system) requires the comparison that distinguishes between self and foreign structures, while on the other hand, it imposes ignorance of self's own existence, under penalty of immuno logical self-destruction". Or, in other words, the immune system 'knows' the distinction between 'self and 'foreign', by ignoring the self-antigenic structures and interfering with everything else, regarding it as 'foreign'.</page><page sequence="6">160 WILFRIED ALLAERTS According to Coutinho et al. (1984) this feature discloses the immune func tion as essentially 'non-cognitive'. Although at birth the immune system is capable of defining Self/non-self, due to a certain maturation of T lymphocytes in the thymus during early fetal life (because T-lymphocytes with a high affinity to self antigens are never allowed to exit the thymus), however the memory response to foreign antigens is not yet developed at birth. This also implicates that the immunological Self/non-self discrimi nation does not constitute an a priori in biology, as revealed by the wide spread occurence of so-called auto-immune diseases, which may affect nearly every organ or tissue and which are considered to be multifactorial in etiology (Nakamura and Nakamura 1992)7. The argument of an 'anthropocentric' bias - or rather a bias based on the higher vertebrate immune system - however, should be taken seriously. In higher vertebrates such as mammals and birds (and in amphibians and reptiles to some degree), the immunological functions are characterized by a high degree of so-called clonal variability and clonal expansion of lym phocytes specifically directed against an individual and variable repertoire of recognition epitopes (antigenic sites of macromolecules) (Burnet 1959). The molecular structures responsible for antigen recognition, namely the immunoglobulins (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules, are formed by a process of clonal rearrangement of variable domain segments encoded in the DNA, and a superimposed variability generating mechanism, which is active at the junction sites of the variable regions (giving rise to the 'junctional variability')8. Also other models of Self/non-self recognition are found in all phyla of biological organisms, and fundamental differ ences exist between vertebrate and invertebrate immune responses, and even between 'higher' and 'lower' vertebrates (Beck and Habicht 1991, 1996; Cooper et al. 1992) (see also 8). Taking into account the universal ity of receptor-mediated responses according to Cooper et al. (1992), a major distinction has to be made between (a) clonally distributed, antigen specific receptors, that 'emerge' as the result of complex rearrangement of variable domain molecules (expressed in e.g. Ig and TCR) and (b) pat tern recognition receptors, i.e. specific genetic defense molecules directed against foreign organisms or substances that are inherited9. These pattern recognition receptors require the induction of secondary signals for T- and B-lymphocyte activation (Cooper et al. 1992)10. The latter strategy (b) is thought to be earliest in evolution and is manifested ubiquitously in invertebrates and also vertebrates. The former strategy (a) however, is only represented in vertebrates, although a limited TCR-MHC repertoire has developed at an early stage of invertebrate evolution (Matsunaga 1990).</page><page sequence="7">THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF-NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION 161 Taking into account that in invertebrates but a limited role is played by specialized recognition molecules necessary for recognition (of foreign) and self-tolerization as observed in (higher) vertebrates, the seemingly paradoxical conclusion is announced that Self/non-self discrimination is closer to direct molecular recognition in invertebrates than in our own species. However, one should be cautious not to abuse the notion of 'mole cular recognition' when giving it the semantics of a cognitive function (see below). Also in mammals, a deviating mechanism of immune reactivity and of self-tolerization occurs, namely in skin keratinocytes (Nickoloff and Turka 1994, 1996), which is reminiscent of some of the more 'primitive' recognition processes as mentioned above. Keratinocytes are very often confronted with environmental challenges and toxins. Nickoloff and Tur ka (1996) wonder why these skin cells are not involved in a pathogenic immune response more frequently and proposed an answer to this enigma in a recent letter to Science11. The relevance of these findings according to Nickoloff and Turka (1996), is that this type of 'tolerization', although not a classical tolerance in the sense of the absence of an immune response, may be an important mechanism of self-tolerance at the macroscopic lev el, and may also be implicated in oral tolerance and 'tolerization' in the neonatus (Chen and Field 1995; Chen et al. 1994; Nickoloff and Turka 1994, 1996). The importance of these new insights in order to distinguish between 'direct' molecular recognition of foreign epitopes and the 'classical' MHC restricted recognition, relies on the vital difference of both stategies with respect to the clonal expansion capacity of the effector lymphocyte popu lation, and this in turn determines the outcome of an immune response at the macroscopic level (Boise and Thompson 1996). Effector lymphocytes indeed may either proceed into a clonal expansion in case of expres sion of the co-stimulatory pathway on professional APC's, and continue their immune defense activity as a population and affect the outcome at the macroscopic level. Or, in the absence of the necessary co-stimulatory pathways, they may have a very short lifetime and undergo apoptosis or programmed cell death, but not without affecting the immune response at a microscopic level (Boise and Thompson 1996). To conclude this section, the similarity between improper but efficient recognition by immune effector cells that proceed into an apoptotic cas cade, which we many regard as a microscopic or cellular cul-de-sac, and the self-destructive process resulting from excessive and inappropriate self-observation (Rosseel and Van Engeland 1991), is striking but super ficial. Both processes occur at a fundamentally different level. According to Coutinho et al. (1984), epistemological considerations have to be pur</page><page sequence="8">162 WILFRIED ALLAERTS sued in order to "compare the cognitive aspects in the operations of the nervous and immune systems" (Coutinho et al., ibidem, p. 151). Strictly speaking, according to Coutinho et al., adopting the notion of 'recogni tion' for the essential activity of the immune system, and postulating that lymphocytes or antibodies 'recognize' molecular patterns, is "veiled ani mism" (Coutinho et al., ibidem, p. 152). For, this attitude would attribute anthropomorphic terms to lymphocytes and immunoglobulins, conferring properties on them they cannot have (Coutinho et al., ibid., p. 152). A different attitude, according to Coutinho et al., is "to describe as cognitive, the activity of complex biological systems, by postulating the processes through which the system may compare its previous and present experi ences, and, therefore know about differences (...) Recognition, whether we want it to be of Self or of foreign, can only be the property of the system." (Coutinho et al., ibid., p. 152). As a final conclusion, we may reformulate Coutinho's position in con trast to the attitude of Tauber (1994), and irrespective the new biological evidence gathered from lower vertebrates and invertebrates, as follows: recognition in the immune system is a function of the system at the macro scopic or individual level, following alterations at a cellular or microscopic level. This macroscopic feature however, strictly differs from the conscious recognition in the nervous system, for the immunological recognition does not coincide with the object of its cognitive activity. We may say it is rather a projective than a reflective property of the biological system, in contrast to the self-reflective activity of consciousness. 4. THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF/NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION AND THE CONNECTIVITY NOTION We previously faced the question whether biological function explanations added to the knowledge of biological phenomena (Allaerts and Roelants 1993). In the present paragraph, an inquiry is proposed starting from the opposite question: For instance, take the function notion which charac terizes the very essence of our immune system, namely the function of immunological self/non-self discrimination (Coutinho 1980; Tauber 1994; see above). With Jerne (1974a) we may ask how to find a mathemat ical basis for the phenomena that subserve the basic functions of our immune system, such as the immune defense against 'foreign' bodies, e.g. pathogens, but also the protection from an auto-immune attack, i.e. the immune reaction against self-antigens. The inquiry into a mathematical or topological (Perelson 1989) basis for immunology is inspired by Jerne's concern of an "immunology that would remain a phenomenology, i.e. an</page><page sequence="9">THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF-NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION 163 ever accumulating catalogue of such phenomena as are at present our dai ly bread' (Jerne 1974a, 46). The answer to the latter question, according to Jerne (1974a, 1974b, 1984) may be found within the framework of the 'lymphocyte network', later on called the idiotypic network' theory. Returning to the question whether the basic functions of the immune system, and the "catalogue of phenomena" (cfr. citation of Jerne 1974a) represented by these functions, can be formalized in a topological frame work, the scientific progress hitherto has been limited. According to Perel son (1989), "topology is only one aspect of immune networks, for it places bounds on what is possible" (p. 20). Beside this phrase, one definite merit of topological modeling in immunology is the notion of connectivity, put forward by Perelson (1989). This connectivity notion appears of cardinal value for understanding the functioning of immune and other biological systems (see below). The framework of an idiotypic network as proposed by Jerne (1974 a,b), which was based on both theoretical considerations of immune repertoire size as well as on experiments on idiotype-anti idiotype suppressive interactions (Jerne 1984), was initially regarded with some suspicion (Weisbuch 1990). According to Weisbuch (1990), among the reasons for suspicion against Jerne's hypothesis (Jerne, 1984) were the contradictory requirements of sensitivity of the network with the 'robust property' of remembering previous antigenic interaction with the network and antigenic stimulation of the network (de Boer and Hogeweg 1989b). Moreover, de Boer and Hogeweg (1989a) object the explanation of Jerne (1974b) of the immune response as an "escape from suppression" phe nomenon, for an immune network based on the latter principle would be unable to control excessive lymphocyte proliferation. Therefore, they assume that in low-dimensional networks (dimension 2 or 3), the 'virgin state' of the immune system is devoid of suppressive network interactions, and excessive proliferation of lymphocytes is only impeded by idiotyp ic suppression at the moment when lymphocyte populations are large, i.e. after proliferation (de Boer and Hogeweg 1989a). In high-dimensional net works, e.g. 5D-networks, disturbances occur that may reduce the capacity of the immune system to exhibit memory or immunity, which means that these disturbances would render the network 'non-functional' (de Boer and Hogeweg 1989b). The notion of connectivity, and 'functional connectivity' in particular, not only is important for understanding how the immune system works, but also is of great importance for the so-called 'functional mapping' of brain centers (Friston et al. 1993; Frith et al. 1995). Indeed, contrary to the notion of strictly localized brain areas of activity as in Penfield's motor cortex maps, Frackowiak and co-workers support the viewpoint of</page><page sequence="10">164 WILFRIED ALLAERTS a nested hierarchy of inter-connected functional brain areas determining certain activity patterns, giving rise to the notion of effective/functional connectivity (of brain areas during activity) (Friston et al. 1993). This effective/functional connectivity moreover, may reflect abnormal features in chronic schizophrenic patients (Frith et al. 1995). More research will, however, be needed to unravel this connectivity of the nervous system in normal and pathological conditions, analogous to the analysis of the connectivity in immune networks (see e.g. de Boer and Hogeweg 1989 a,b; Perelson 1989). Apparently, the notion of connectivity in the case of idiotypic immune networks (de Boer and Hogeweg 1989 a,b) reflects a particular case of solv ing the dimensionality question, which imposes general limiting conditions in describing topological invariance of morphogenetic systems (Allaerts 1997, in prep). Jerne in a letter to the author (Jerne pers. comm. Sept. 21, 1992), suggests the notion of 'connectedness' to represent the probability of two randomly chosen antibodies to recognize each other and to form a dimer, which is a temporally variable, dimensionless quantity that may only be characterized as an averaged condition of the network at a certain stage of development12. Other attempts to define the connectivity (Perelson 1989, 10) of the idiotypic network, based on the recognition probability between random antibodies and a critical 'percolation threshold'13, which is a function of the magnitude of the immune repertoire, have revealed high ly connected (Perelson 1989) and thus paradoxical (de Boer and Hogeweg 1989b) results. However, the notion of network connectivity as a phase transition principle, as discovered by Perelson (1989), may indeed have some value for characterizing the ontogeny of the immune system in topo logical terms, which system according to the same author is a special kind of the morphogenetic systems as first described by Turing (1952). To conclude, our present analysis indicates that introducing functional explanatory schemata for understanding basic functions of the immune system - which primarily is the discrimination between self and non-self - forwards the notion of network connectivity/connectedness. Moreover, functional explanatory schemes as well as a kind of stability-controllability trade-off, characteristic of morphogenetic systems (Perelson 1989), con strain the dimensionality of these networks (de Boer and Hogeweg 1989 a,b), which may be helpful in defining criteria of topological invariance of these biological systems. The involvement of the connectivity notion in phase transitions of the idiotypic network, as a special kind of morphogenetic systems (Perelson 1989), may subserve the characterization of topological invariants that are typical for the ontogenesis of the immune system. Further research in this</page><page sequence="11">THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF-NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION 165 domain, will also be useful to comprehend the functioning of idiotype anti-idiotype interactions and a network behavior at a local scale, i.e. at the organismal or tissue level, and confined to a certain stage in normal development or during pathological processes.

NOTES 1 A replacement of the genomic level by the organismal level not only raises the problem of the extrapollation from a less to a more complex organisation and the concomitant conflict between reductionism and an integrative or holistic phenomenology of biological process es, it also imposes the risk of adopting group-selection forces for explaining evolutionary adaptation in stead of individual-level effects (see e.g. McKean et al. 1996). Moreover, the translation to the organismal level raises the question of the usefulness of the phenomeno logical method in describing biological self-determination (see also Allaerts 1996 subm.). Following the examples of integrative biology defended by holistic protagonists like e.g. Henderson (1928), it is obvious that Tauber in his monography (1994) leans toward the integrative phenomenological method. 2 The recognition of non-self moreover following the Darwinistic logic is regarded essential to immune system functioning, based on the argument that "non-self" is likely to have different genetic interests from those of the host (McKean et al. 1996). 3 The example of immunological self-determination (e.g. Coutinho et al. 1984) illustrates the basic problem encountered in the research programme devoted to explaining biological functions in terms of the 'stereospecificity' of the smallest relevant biological units, the macromolecules (Monod 1970); we call this the molecular biology programme. As a reaction to holistic trends in biology, Monod opposed the analytical method in molecular biology, devoted to the characterization of (macro)molecular functioning in a stereospe cific manner (Monod, ibidem, p. 92-94). Apart from the criticism that macromolecules in biological organisms exert their stereospecific function(s) within well-defined cellular</page><page sequence="12">166 WILFRIED ALLAERTS compartments such as the intracellular or extracellular domains, the various membraneous compartments or the nucleus, it is the discovery of some of the basic functions of the immune system that most stringently mitigated the molecular reductionism as proposed by Monod (1970). Immunological studies have demonstrated that the discrimination between self- and non-self-antigenic properties, i.e. macromolecular stereospecific structures, when referring to acquired immunity, is a complex process developed during each individual life. The mechanisms involved in these processes are based on specific recognition mechanisms (see also section 3) performed by specialized immune cells, at certain stages of develop ment and within a certain organismal (micro)environment (Weigle 1971; Rammensee et al. 1989; Schwartz 1990). 4 An essential problem in the 'molecular biology programme' (see Footnote 3) is the prob lem of a topological characterization of biological processes in general, and a topological characterization of the biological function notion in particular (Allaerts and Roelants 1993). Referring to the topological analysis of local and global (integral) aspects of morphogenesis as proposed by Presnov and Isaeva (1990), a dual meaning of the biological function notion is conceived. With respect to morphogenetic systems, the biological function notion has the connotation of (i) an explicit, local dependency of the positional information of the system (Presnov and Isaeva 1990; Allaerts and Roelants 1993) and of (ii) an implicit reference to causal relationships between successive integral patterns during the process of development of the system (Nissen 1971). Within this context, it is not without importance to delineate the conceptual distinc tions between the notions of biological functions, biological wholes (or ensembles) and Gestalts, in order to avoid a number of misconceptions resulting from terminological con fusion. To the above listed concepts we may eventually add the notion of biological effect, i.e. the effect of a biological process, marked by a chronological relation between the effect and its causal determinants (De Loof 1993). Taking advantage of basic notions of topology (Armstrong 1979; Thorn 1969), we previously concluded that no chronological order can be established between biological form and function (Allaerts and Roelants 1993). Therefore, it is more convenient to discard the notion of 'biological function' from the connotation of 'effect'. However, as was already mentioned by Nissen, functional statements indeed are causal statements and have implicit (!) reference to 'goals' (Nissen 1971, 256). The equalization of form (morphology) and function - being two aspects of the "logos of living organisms" (Thorn 1974) - may also be misleading, when this equalization is regarded as an identity. The representation of biological functions as Gestalts encourages the mistaken suggestion that biological functions can be entirely explained within physics, in analogy with the so-called 'cooperative phenomena' (Fannes and Verbeure 1989). It was the merit of Popper (1977, 24) to have refuted the argument that "all wholes, living organisms, Gestalt experiences should be explained within physics". The latter argument was originally proposed by Kohler (1920, 1961). Popper explained that a distinction has to be made between a whole in the sense of a 'Gestalt', and a whole in the sense of a 'totality', for "we can not know any object in the sense of knowing the totality of its properties" (Popper, ibidem, p. 24). 5 The exact nature of these phagocytes in higher vertebrate organisms later on became eluci dated as a population of specialized cells, called macrophages. Moreover, also other phago cyting and antigen presenting cells (APC's), the latter characterized by the so-called major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class II restriction molecules, have been unveiled, such as the neutrophilic granulocytes (mentioned by Tauber, ibid., pp. 126-127) and dendritic cells (Allaerts and Drexhage 1994). However, the importance of Metchnikoff's discovery nowadays lies in the universality of this defense mechanism in the animal kingdom, since</page><page sequence="13">THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SELF-NON-SELF DISCRIMINATION 167 all metazoan phyla - from sponges to vertebrates - have a population of phagocytotic cells and, furthermore, unicellular organisms like protozoans can be phagocytotic (Beck and Habicht 1991, 1996). 6 Some recent examples of the template theory arising from recent discoveries of the immune repertoire in lower vertebrates (e.g. sharks and skates, see Litman 1996) and invertebrates (Beck and Habicht 1996), are mentioned in Section 3 of this paper (see also Footnote 8). 7 The autonomy of the immune system, moreover, with respect to the creation of an own, individualized set of T-lymphocyte clones is a well-established and specific finding: experiments with germfree mice fed on a chemically defined ultrafiltered diet were shown to autonomously generate their T-lymphocyte-repertoire, whereas no such capacity was found with respect to the B-lymphocyte-repertoire (Vos 1990). 8 Junctional diversity (caused by random DNA nucleotide deletions at the combining site) (Fujimoto and Yamagishi 1987; Okazaki et al. 1987) and combinatorial diversity (by combinations of the V, D, and J sequences in the variable regions of the DNA) (Tonegawa 1983; Kronenberg et al. 1986) are two different stategies of evolutionary adaptation in generating recognition diversity, which have been differently followed in cartilaginous fishes and higher vertebrates (Litman 1996). Sharks thus have a greater genetic diversity by the presence of multiple copies of pre-joined V,D(1,2), J gene segments in their genome, which therefore are to be considered as a major stock of potential recognition templates. The question of whether immunological memory relies on a template model or an acquired clonal memory model, not only differs greatly between lower invertebrates like sharks and higher vertebrates like mammals, but also must be seen as a kind of host-dependent trade-off between predictable recognition and new emergent variation (Litman 1996). 9 Another major distinction in immune defense mechanisms regards the classical distinction between cellular (especially via the T-lymphocytes) and humoral immunity, the latter depending on diffusable defense molecules in the blood and other body fluids: these not only contain the antigen-specific immunoglobulins (Ig) but also various cytokines, like interleukins (IL) and growth factors. Humoral immune activity through cytokines according to Beck and Habicht (1991, 1996) is probably present in all metazoan phyla including arthropods, echinoderms (Beck and Habicht 1986) and molluscs (Ottaviani et al. 1993) and even in the protozoans, but some exceptions may exist like the phyla of Nemertinea, Platyhelminthes or Coelenterata (Beck and Habicht 1991). Although cytokines are quite universal in the animal kingdom, immunoglobulins are the 'invention' of the vertebrates (Cooper etal. 1992). 10 Invertebrates have a so-called "broad spectrum recognizing system", which means that relatively simple molecules like sugar units may be detected specifically by lectin-like recognition sites, whereas in vertebrates the recognition site and the recognized epitope are extremely individualized but also highly specific (Cooper et al. 1992). The dependance on induction signals for producing certain cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a) has also been conserved in mammals, as shown by the induction of these cytokines by bacterial lipopolysaccharides. 11 In the 'classical' pathway of a cellular immune response the so-called dual molecular recognition is involved following a stereospecific pattern: this involves the interaction of the B7 with the CD28 molecule and the interaction of the MHC-class II molecule with the TCR, respectively expressed in the APC's (B7 and MHC class II) and T-lymphocytes (CD 28 and TCR) (Guinan et al. 1994). Although not 'classical' APC's, keratinocytes indeed express MHC-class II antigens in a large group of immune-mediated skin diseases, some of which have an autoimmune etiology (see e.g. Allaerts and Drexhage 1994). The relative autonomy of keratinocytes is reminiscent of their tenacity of an 'ancient' defense system</page><page sequence="14">168 WILFRIED ALLAERTS (see Footnotes 9 and 10). Ding et al. (1993) have demonstrated that karatinocytes produce IL-10, that inhibits the expression of the B7 bystander molecule on professional APC's, preventing these APC's to stimulate T-cells. At the same time, keratinocytes may have a direct T-helper 2 (H2)-cell costimulatory activity, making them independent of professional APC's to stimulate T-H2-cells, particularly with respect to IL-4 production (Blotta et al. 1996) and without stimulating T-Hi-cells via interferon-7 (Goodman et al. 1994). 12 Tankersley et al. (1988) indeed have experimentally demonstrated that the connectedness as thus defined is very low between the immunoglobulins of an individual, for a mecha nism suppressing idiotype-anti-idiotype formation may exist in vivo, but on the contrary, in immunoglobulin preparations collected from a large group of individuals an increasing connectedness occurs with the number of donors. Jerne further remarks that for a better understanding of the network behaviour, a more detailed knowledge is necessary of the lifetimes of the individual elements of the idiotypic network (i.e. lymphocytes and antibod ies) as well as of the mean lifetimes and steady states of the network elements (Jerne 1984; Jerne, pers. comm. 1992). 13 According to Perelson (1989), idiotypic networks can be represented by a Bethe lattice, i.e. an infinite lattice in which each node is connected to at most z other nodes; z is called the coordination number of the lattice. In the Perelson model, 'connectivity' of the network depends on the relationship between the magnitudes of the recognition probability between two random paratopes and a critical 'percolation threshold' Pc, a dimensionless number given by the formula. Pc = I/z-I Perelson (1989) suggests that the coordination number z is equal to the expressed immune repertoire (minus one), which however would implicate a highly connected immune network with only sluggish response capability to external antigenic stimulation.
