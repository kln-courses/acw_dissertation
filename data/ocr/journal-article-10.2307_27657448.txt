<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Youth of the Church GERARD S. SLOYAN N American literary critic of considerable stature tells in his autobiographic sketch what life was like for a little Jew in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn thirty years ago. It is a memorable account. He speaks of his religion feelingly as something grand and austere: "Even in their synagogue, under the chandeliers terrible with sun all through the 'Great Day' of Atonement, I had heard them up in the front pews nearest the Ark making a little deal whenever they looked up at intervals from the prayers they were mumbling so fast that even they, I guessed, had no notion what the words meant. They neither believed nor disbelieved; they never thought about it; He had been with us a long time. Only, there was no promise of gladness in Him. Surely He had been real in der HeymT1 This extract puts its finger unerringly on the limitations of a faith that is all loyalty and unmeditated custom. The observations would seem to be as valid for the New Covenant as the Old. No more than the Jew is the Christian absolved from finding gladness in the Lord, who is equally real in every clime, Who since Pentecost has had no single homeland. An ageless God is easily conceived in terms of age and static sameness. He should not be, of course. If there must be an analogue for Him it is vigour and the resiliency of youth. The psalmist sang* "Like clothing you change them [the earth and the heavens] and they are changed,/ but you are the same and your years have no end" (101 [102]: 27f). Then, as if to counter-balance any misconception that might arise of Him who established the earth "of old," in the next song the Lord is described as renewing the psalmist's youth like the eagle's (102 [103]: 5). The Isaian Book of Consolation has Yahve restoring the failing strength even of youth, under the same figure of an eagle's wings (Is. 40: 31). The young grow weary, but El Olam, God Eternal, rejuvenates them. Older than the bilis, He is nonetheless younger than youth. The Church prays to her guiding Spirit, "Riga quod est aridiim . . . Flecte quod est rigidum." The sequence is in the same strain as the ancient plea, "Emitte spiritum tuum . . ." which saw in the Lord's breath creation and renewal (Ps. 103 [104]: 30).

There is resistance. The result is dryness and stiffness, the signs of age. The Spirit is young but hearts grow old. A fruit-bearing tree Mr. Gerald Brenan tells of meeting an amiably anti-clerical schoolmaster in Cordova?one wonders if he would have stood treat to any other kind?who reports to him: "Yes, there has been a genuine revival (in schooling). But you must bear in mind that the Church in Spain is like an old, old tree, some of whose branches have fallen and lie rotting on the ground. Not all the people you see dressed as Catholics are Catholic inside."2 The holier-than-thou smugness characteristic of the lapsus may put us off, but the Cordovan's analogy merits attention. The Church is not in fact meant to be an old, old tree with sapless limbs. Her Founder spoke of the Father's Reign as a tree greater than any garden herb; in its branches the birds of the air would settle (Mt. 13: 32). Surely Christ had in mind Ezechiel's parable of Israel the great cedar, "which shall put forth its branches and bear fruit," despite the ravages of Babylon and Egypt (Ez. 17:23). "From its topmost twigs, I will pluck a tender one,/ And I will plant it on a high and commanding mountain," the prophecy had read (v. 22). When this tender shoot came to maturity, Christ did not claim a cedar's eminence for it, but He did insist that, "Under it shall nestle birds of every feather,/ In the shadow of its branches shall they nestle" (loc. cit.). As for Himself, He chose to be the supple vine which would give life to branches (Jn. 15: 5). Saint Paul saw in Israel the true olive's stock, and in the Gentiles the wild olive branches grafted in (Rom. 11: 17-24). The two share root and richness of the true olive equally. In all these figures employed by the living word of Scripture there is talk of life and vigour and newness, none of fallen, rotting branches. Yet it is the Catholic fact, just as it was under the Law when a pruning-hook was needed (Mt. 3: 10), that in her visible aspect the Church shows evident signs of the "infirmity of our human condition."3 The tragic inclination toward evil in the individual is at the bottom of this, says Pope Pius XII. 2.

The Church in its faith, sacraments and other gifts is inexhaustibly fecund. Yet how are men to know that? As Jesus observed, they judge by what they see. To speak of the youth of the Church is to employ a figure of language. The Church is a created thing, of course. It is the body of Christ existing in time. For that reason one is correct in speaking of the "early Church," designating either the first three decades or the first three centuries, as he may choose. After that, however, terms lose their literal meaning. Is twenty centuries infancy, adolescence or advanced age for the Church? Who can say? Any mention of youthfulness has to mean that the living organism, the Church, possesses figuratively the properties of youth rather than age. The seeds of her destruction are not at work in her nor even sown. This situation is totally unique among living organisms. The Church is assured life in undiminished vigour. The factors that mean "age" for the human organism are diet, climate, psychic influence, and cell structure. The last-named rules the day, for there is no appeal from the sentence of catabolic change. The soul is powerless to stay the destructive process. In the physical organism at least, age must come on. It is a different matter in the realm of the spirit. The eighty-year old can be as youthful as any in the company. He cannot not have experienced, and in that sense much of the discovery proper to youth is closed to him. What he can do is continue to assimilate new experiences and be modified by them. If "quasi-infinity" describes humanity's power to "become all things," then in theory youth is perpetual. All that is needed is a soul conscious of the many accidental form* it has never taken. The life-giving Spirit We are safe in attributing endless youth to the Church because although her constituent cells wither and die by a law of nature, her informing Spirit is vivificans until the end of time. He has a truly infinite capacity, and is limited only by the finite quality of those who make up the Church. How, then, can the Church look hoary and old in any age? That is the problem. She is from the first Christ's youthful bride, without wrinkle or blemish. How do people come to take her for a dowager</page><page sequence="4">498 THE FURROW or a crone; a "great brood-hen of earth" forever clucking if clucks make amove to leave her side or anyone comes near? Men make the false identification because of the failure of Christians adequately to be the Church. The Son, her Bridegroom, adorns her from the day of her "nuptials of blood upon the cross and the wedding embrace of Pentecost."4 The adornments are His peace, His visible and temporal empire over all flesh, and a paiticipation in the hatred of the world. These gifts mean that the Son's glory is hers, and His unity with the Father likewise hers by participation: "claritatem, quam dedisti milii, dedi eis: ut sint unum sicut et nos iinum sumus" (Jn. 17: 22). It should at the same time never be forgotten that the Bride must expect the recriminations visited on the Spouse. One does not walk into Christ nowadays, it is true, but the Church is always there. P?re de Lubac remarks, "There are many who would be willing to admire her for some things at least, in spite of all the faults they find in her, so many who would be ready to 'co-operate' with her, as they say, if only she were not what she is."5 She is inevitably a thing of Christ, and it is a fine line between the Christ in her that men can not tolerate and the elements which they claim repel them. "The possibility of corruption" The Church must expect persecution. Her members are not free, however, to indulge a "persecution complex." There are times when she deserves chastisement because of the conduct of certain men who compose her. Divine institution though it is, the Church was proclaimed to and is ever made up of men marked by "human inadequacy, weakness, and the possibility of corruption."6 Paul Simon, whose phrase this is, observes that the unchanging, imperishable element belongs solely to the divine in the Church. "The servants of the Church, in every age, have been and are for the most part, no more than average men, apt to be narrowed in their outlook by reason of their specialised work, as is the case with others who are compelled to limit their activity to tasks demanding entire devotion."7 The writer of those 4.

We must not make the mistake (nor do we accuse him of making it) of identifying the Church exclusively with her priests. He makes a valid point, however, when he says that all faithful servants come to conceive their duty in terms of the interests they represent. This inevitably brings collision of interests, humans being what they are. The effect is that the Church's history is marked by any number of conflicts in which human ideas and beliefs have prevailed over the dictates of the Spirit. Father Simon gives as an example the secularisation of 1803, when the voluntary transfer of ecclesiastical wealth might have served many souls and redounded to the Church's glory. "This wealth (of certain religious foundations) was no longer fruitful in the sense intended by the founders; but the inheritors did not, in all probability, possess the spiritual power to create for themselves new tasks for the employment of the old resources."8 It is small wonder that in these recurring situations, when custodians claim duty reinforced by solemn religious oath as their justification, the Church is not praised for her youth or exuberance. That she is God's Kingdom palpably established in the hearts of men escapes many onlookers. Men who have a trust to carry out are fearful of folly. Men who have a sacred trust rightly suspect the mentality that knows nothing of tradition. The clamour to rebuild in every age is likeliest to be raised by a fool. When Christ's Church is the cause espoused by a fool, he can do incalculable, even eternally irreparable, harm. Form and custom There is such a thing as form and custom in human behaviour; when there is an association with sacred behaviour, such as worship, stability makes special claims. Religion's changeless creeds should be expected to find expression in cult and observance different in tempo from other human institutions. Yet even though God is unchanging and humanity relatively stable in its nature and needs, human problems have a way of altering from age to age?in the last two centuries, from decade to decade. This means that the case for human tradition as it touches divine things is considerably modified. The common man may not know the term Zeitgeist but he experiences the fact. Dogma as immutable he can comprehend; stylised behaviour in sacramental rites he can take in equally. 8. Ibid., p. 46.</page><page sequence="6">500 THE FURROW It is the inability of an ageless institution like the Church to be free of the influence of an age that is clearly past that confuses him. An amusing aspect of all this (if one had time to be amused) is that the "traditional" to which the Church at times seems wedded is often little more than a century old. An appeal is made to the centuries when in the particular case (say of hymnody, or the social order, or whatever else) some totally fortuitous occurrence of 1873 was the determinant. The Church could much more fruitfully regress five centuries or fifteen: not on any principle of false archaism but because all organisms are cyclic and the Church is no exception. Absolute modernity is not necessarily excellence. Great achievement in areas such as charity, formal worship, social organisation and cultural enrichment have marked the Church in the past. It is a sign of her youthfulness that she need never hesitate to renew herself from the treasury of her own memory. It is characteristic of youth that it wishes to innovate, and that it is often fearless. The reason for the first may be that it does not know how "old" the "new" is. "We tried that," comprises no real argument for youth. As a matter of fact, the "we" who are young did not try it. Others did. Again, youth is often not so much brave or even foolhardy as ignorant of the risks involved in a given course. Age remembers all its attempts; it recalls not only its failures but also reports of previous failures that kept it from attempting. Age is cautious. It has learned all the pitfalls. It can always say that it has survived, in itself no small achievement. But there is the ever present possibility that age will be imprudent where youth is for prudence. Prudence requires action as often as inaction: courageous action full of trust in God and contrary to all human inclinations and fears. It will be highly "imprudent" at times (we speak of the Christian virtue here) not to take the bold and unexpected course. The Church has looked old in circumstances where she should have looked young. Wrong counsels prevailed when her members recalled all that they should have forgot, and forgot an abandonment to the Holy Spirit that they had done well to recall. P?re de Lubac observes that in the Church of Christ the succession of generations is growth and not the "painful creation of an ultimate caste of inheritors," for its perpetual stabilisation is in God.9 Time is not destructive in the Church's case as in other cases. There always emerges that which is destined to life. Eternal 9. de Lubac, op. cit., p. 132.</page><page sequence="7">THE YOUTH OF THE CHURCH 501 communion marks the Church, not historical succession. He quotes Claudel on the Canticle: "The Bride of Christ never ceases to be aware of that total humanity she carries in her womb." The Church is in the world as a storehouse of human hope; a ferment; a witness to Christ, who came to "shake human life to its foundations" ; a warrior, as little Israel had been before it. "Her whole end is to show us Christ, lead us to Him, and communicate His grace to us; to put it in a nutshell, she exists solely to put us in relation with Him. She alone can do that, and it is a task which she never completes."10 Youth is required for that. Age either considers its tasks completed or else, knowing that they are not, has the will but not the strength to finish them. "If youth but could, if age but would," the proverb sighs. Holy Church, youthful perpetually, both can and does, if the Spirit is not impeded. Tensions Catholic life to be fruitful in any age must be marked by certain tensions. Changelessness marks the Kingdom as it will be manifest in glory, but not as it is here established. There is required a certain impatience, that Christ has not come to full stature in the world of men. Yet such impatience is not always efficacious or well-advised in the form it takes. It can wear itself out in vain regrets and recriminations. These are signs of immaturity rather than youth. There can be revolt against structures within the Church, what a French writer calls "son visage historique." Sclerosis in parish life, a lack of adaptation in the liturgy, an anthropomorphic and anthropocentric mentality in religion: to attack these is perhaps to promote the Christian spirit but it is not necessarily to build the Church.11 For that there is required inner growth in every cell of the organism. The danger exists that new conformities will supplant the older ones, all in the name of Christian renewal. Economic and political and social structures, when attacked in the name of Christ, shortly revert to their original patterns if the attackers have not fully lived the life of the Church throughout. The Church can only live if individual cells will let her live, which means that each one must live to the full the life the Spirit brings. Surely the key to why the Church is not everywhere young and vital lies in a failure to permit this vivifying process. Setting aside 10. Ibid., p. 148. 11. J. E., "Avant Propos", Je b?tirai mon ?glise, (8 Jeunesse de VEglise), Paris, 1948, p. 9.</page><page sequence="8">502 THE FURROW completely venality, complacency and other such gross betrayals of Christ, there is the fact of a mutual suspicion between two groups who desire equally to serve the Church of God. (Cleric and lay makes little difference in this matter.) One group is convinced that the clamour for reforms within the Church is mere activism or shibboleth-trading, if not barbarous iconoclasm. The other group decries insensitivity to challenges which threaten the good of souls and the Church's very well-being. Neither group quite hears, let alone heeds, the other. The Catholic needs to maintain that the Church "enters . . . into relation with every age. But she also opposes each."12 This means that she is committed to a temporal existence, though herself eternally abiding above space and time. It further means that each of her members (her laity in a special way, under priestly guidance of an indirect kind) must do as she does. They must engage in temporal affairs fully while at the same time being completely detached inwardly. "Well, God seeks what is His and Caesar what is his," the Christian may be disposed to say. That is laziness; whether in priest or layman it is over-facile and a shirking of the problem. It is a failure to see that the Church is not charged with a part of life only, but all of life. Her mission is to become very much a part of the world, while trusting that Her abiding Spirit will keep Her members unspotted by it. The Church engages with every issue. She is afraid of none. She knows no human cause in which it is indiscreet to speak. Whether docens or discens, she proves her youth by bold initiative. Like all the young she recovers from set-backs easily and returns to the fray. Unlike many of the young she is skilled to the point of sureness in proportioning means to ends. She can not be guilty of folly or imprudence if she lets her Spirit guide her. To conclude then: it is easy but in a sense fruitless to hymn the Church's youthfulness. Young she will be in any case. It may have the effect of lulling us to inaction if the Holy Spirit is praised for what He will accomplish in spite of us. What the Catholic needs to do, whatever his role, is to look within himself to see if the Church has in him a living stone. If the answer is yes, she will be daily renewed; if no, then not all the altering of structures within and about her can keep her from looking like a decrepit caricature of the youthful bride of Christ.
