<plain_text><page sequence="1">Human-animal imagery, shamanic visions, and ancient American aesthetics REBECCA STONE-MILLER Introduction Whereas separation from and dominance over the natural world is basic to Western thought, Native American cultures emphasized an animal-human continuum, from creation times onward.1 The foundational myths of Mesoamerica, for example, are filled with people and divinities that have integral, viable, and legitimate animal aspects, stages, and/or forms. The Popol Vuh, the famous Maya book of creation, begins by naming the creator as: "The Maker, The Modeler, named Bearer, Begetter, Hunahpu Possum, Hunahpu Coyote, Great White Peccary, Coati, Sovereign Plumed Serpent, Heart of the Lake, Heart of the Sea, plate shaper, bowl shaper, ... the midwife, matchmaker..." (Tedlock 1996:63, author's italics). In this account, divine, animal, and human elements are presented as interchangeable aspects of the prime supernatural creative force. This power first created animals as "an experiment with the human work, the human design" (ibid.:66-68), but since the animals did not speak, they were relegated to lives of service and consumption. In the sequence of creation, animals did, however, precede the earliest people. Made of clay, these first humans merely crumbled, to be replaced by wooden ones who had no hearts and ultimately became the monkeys (ibid:73). Here a reversible relationship between humans and animals is posited. The divine creative force actually allowed animals (and animated objects) to destroy the wooden people. Turkeys and dogs, both domesticated, edible animals, turned on the wooden beings and accused them, "You caused us pain, you ate us, but now it is you whom we shall eat" (ibid.:72). People finally attain their full-fledged humanity from a mixture of animal blood and maize (Miller and Taube 1993:70). Thus, this formative Maya narrative placed animals as the earliest stages of humanity, featured them as main characters throughout, and at times even let animals gain the upper hand. Plants, too, were absolutely integral to the final human form, embedding humankind firmly among the fauna and flora of the natural world. Similarly, Aztec (Mexica) creation myths posited eras of victorious jaguars, people who became monkeys, butterflies, dogs, turkeys, and fish, as well as successful humans coming from blood mixed with bones, ground like maize for tortillas (ibid.). Many other Amerindian peoples saw the early races of humans as the result of mating with animals, especially dogs (Schwartz 1997:19-28), so that the resulting viable human beings were fundamentally two animals conflated. In many cultures of ancient Mesoamerica nearly every ritual day, and thus every person born (Miller 2001:39), had as one of their names that of an animal (caiman, monkey, deer, jaguar, etc.), plant (flower, grass, etc.), or a natural phenomenon (rain, wind, etc.). Personal names were also rife with animal referents, such as the famous Mixtee woman warrior 6 Monkey's nickname of "Serpent Quechquemitl" (Snake Cape) or the great king "8 Deer Tiger [Jaguar] Claw" (Marcus 1992:380, 385-387). A Maya king may be a "Great Blue-Green Quetzal Macaw" (Yax Kuk Moh, the lineage founder at Copan [Fash 1991:79]) and an Aztec ruler a "Hummingbird Feather" (Huitzilihuitl, the second Mexica ruler [Townsend 2000:12]). Likewise, in Andean art, even when no record of a person's name remains, consistent attributes in artistic imagery may still allow us to call him "The Owl Priest" (Stone-Miller 2002b:85). Moche ceramic sculptures, Paracas embroideries, and Wari stone reliefs, to name a few, show people who are simultaneously deer, birds, butterflies, beans, potatoes, A version of this paper was presented at the 2000 College Art Association meeting as part of a session organized by Carolyn T?te entitled "Gods? Cults? Deities? The Problematic of the Spiritual in Non-Western Art/' It represents an initial foray into a study to be entitled Flowers in the Dark: Visions and the Artistic Enterprise in the Ancient Americas, referring to the fact that such vision-inducing plants as peyote (Lophophora williamsi) and the "San Pedro" cactus {Trichocereus pachanoi) flower at night, aptly encapsulating the inverted world of shamanic ritual and thought. 1. For instance, the creation account in Genesis emphatically emphasized that God created humans in absolute distinction from, as well as superiority and dominion over, all animals: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. . . . And God blessed them [the man and woman he had just created], and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth over the earth" (Genesis 1:26-28, author's italics). A rare Medieval depiction of Adam naming the animals clearly illustrates human superiority by locating the figure of Adam well above those of the animals (Clark 1956:52). In Greek traditions, to be turned into an animal or plant was usually a punishment or an act of pity, as it was for Narcissus, Aktaion, Daphne, Syrinx, Philomela, and Prokne (Martin 2003:85, 12,46, 111).</page><page sequence="2">48 RES 45 SPRING 2004 maize, or even peanuts (fig. 1). Even though analysis of the art of Central America lags behind that of other areas, there are recurrent crocodile-, insect-, jaguar-, and bird-people throughout the Panamanian and Costa Rican corpus (figs. 2, 8, 9 [left],11, 12).2 There is no denying the visual evidence that the cultural categories of "human," "animal," and "plant" were seen, and depicted, as overlapping, even to some extent interchangeable, all across the ancient Americas. Shamanic visions However clear the importance of animals to Native American cultures and however well-worn the truism that Amerindians sought "harmony with nature," the spiritual basis for this shared human-animal trajectory still requires our attention, as do the artistic implications of such a fundamental spiritual connection. I argue here that the unified animal-human continuum presented throughout the art of the indigenous Americas flows from the high value placed on visionary experiences of animal transformation. A primary aspect of altered consciousness is often the direct kinesthetic experience of becoming an animal, or several animals, and/or watching animals change into other animals and beings. This is both a visceral and a visual experience, but not one that partakes of "normal" seeing and corporeal sensation. Examples abound in the American tradition of animal transformation, from ancient and colonial texts to modern shamans' and scientific subjects' narrations of their visions. Again in the Popol Vuh the human leader of the Quiche (K'iche') peoples spends time in the sky and in the Underworld as a snake, an eagle, and a "tigre" ([jaguar], see Musgrave-Portilla 1982:14). In 1530 Herrera reported on the Indian account of the founding of Cerriquin, Honduras, on the spot where a 200-year old woman named Coamizagual became a bird, flew away, and never more was seen as a woman (op. cit.). During a healing session, a contemporary Peruvian shaman heard an owl screeching and in her visions the owl was an enemy shaman's shadow self (Glass-Coffin 1998:122). Finally, a modern scientific subject from Santiago perhaps summed it up best when he described himself first as becoming an immense bird, then a fish, then: Figure 1.

I wasn't a fish anymore, but a big cat, a tiger. I walked, though, feeling the same freedom I had experienced as a bird and a fish, freedom of movement, flexibility, grace, I moved as a tiger in the jungle, joyously, feeling the ground under my feet, feeling my power; my chest grew larger. I then approached an animal, any animal. / only saw its neck, and then experienced what a tiger feels when looking at its prey. (Naranjo 1973:185, author's italics) Such a complete identification of oneself with an animal, to the extent of experiencing a mighty predator's selective focus on the vulnerable necks of potential prey, certainly informs the images discussed in this essay. 2. See, for example, Stone-Miller 2002a: cat. nos. 143, 147, 157, 187, 219, 222, 261, 263, 297, 311, 325, 355, 356, 396, 397.</page><page sequence="3">Stone-Miller: Human-animal imagery, shamanic visions, and ancient American aesthetics 49 Amerindian artists conveyed conflated human-animal beings as "real" in their definition of reality.3 As examples, a famous Moche stirrup spout vessel features a woman shaman with an owl head (Stone-Miller 2002b:111, ill. 89) and an allied Costa Rican ceramic effigy of a woman shaman (fig. 2) actively transforms into a crocodile. Her round eyes bulge out; her head erupts into scutes (bony ridges); her lower legs sprout crocodilian heads; snakes encircle her waist; one supernaturally ten-fingered hand holds a cup that likely held the mind-altering brew; and she sits on a special bench, itself also a fantastical double-headed animal (Stone-Miller 2002a:126-127). These ?mages, among countless others, are neither couched in terms of normal visual experience nor rest comfortably within the category of the wholly human (it can be argued that in shamanic thought such a category does not exist). It is fruitless?and frankly ethnocentric of us?to try to force such multidimensional works of art into our linear Western system of thought when they so creatively lay bare the ancient American conviction in a visionary palimpsest of realities. A working definition of shamanism is necessary as a theoretical framework in which such animal transformation experiences can be mobilized to help interpret ancient artistic imagery. First, it is important to acknowledge at the outset what shamanism is not: a religion with set deities, liturgies, physical spaces, and institutionalized roles. Shamanism can best be thought of as a spiritual stance and a set of practices based on flux; therefore, appropriately enough, it cannot itself be held to static and neatly characterized parameters. That very flexibility, plus the widely perceived efficacy and the advantages it offers for human adaptation to stressful situations (Dobkin de Rios 1984; McClenon 1994; Winkelman 2000), have helped shamanism persevere for millennia. It has retained a core of experiential practices orally transmitted through strict, long-term apprenticeships. This "core shamanism" can be understood as a spiritual orientation toward a direct, transcendent, non-human, healing experience of supernatural cosmic energy (encompassing human, animal, natural, and abstractly divine aspects) achieved through altered consciousness states that feature multi sensorial visions. Within altered consciousness states the visual effects are perhaps the most dramatic, albeit Figure 2. Female Shaman Seated on a Bicephalic Crocodile Bench. Central America, Costa Rica, Atlantic Watershed, El Rio Appliqu?. Period V, a.D. 500-800. Ceramic. 83/4x 73/4x 51/2 in. (22.2 x 19.7 x 14 cm). 1991.4.319. Ex coll. William C. and Carol W.

Carlos Museum (Photograph by Michael McKelvey). among a welter of sensation full of synesthetic perceptions (i.e., smells that are heard, sights that are felt, etc.; Kl?ver 1928). Precisely because of the overt visuality of supernatural communications, shamanic cultures tend to produce art imagery, embody values, and choose forms and design configurations that are not primarily based on normal human perceptual phenomena, but rather on the brilliantly colorful, rapidly shifting, combinatory possibilities of visions. Theirs is a religious complex of the Image; however, because the person actively becomes many things simultaneously (including patterns and things we consider inanimate [Siegel 1977:4]) this Image is a lived and breathed subjective entity, not merely a passively absorbed external visual object. 3. Cultural definitions of "realism" vary. For example, Mexica lyric poems about art, artists, and artistry are worth noting: "The one who gives life to clay . . . /The good potter / he takes great pains with his work; / he teaches the clay to lie. . . ."(Leon-Portilla 1963:173).</page><page sequence="4">50 RES 45 SPRING 2004 a b Figure 3.

Rear view The purpose of the transformative vision quest experience decidedly eschews the recreational. Narrative after narrative by anthropologist, indigenous shaman, and scientific subject alike include understated observations such as "this is not pleasant" (Reichel Dolmatoff 1972:92) or "illusions of sight, hearing and taste ... are not of an agreeable, but on the contrary, of a terrifying and distressful kind" (Lewin 1931, as quoted in Schultes and Raffauf 1992:57). Some go into more graphic detail: one informant describes the repeated experience of being squeezed throughout his vision by naturalistically enormous, neon-colored boa constrictors.4 In terms of actual and perceived size, in Panam?, these brightly colored rainforest snakes, such as the red-tailed boa (Boa constrictor ortonii), reach nine feet, elsewhere up to eighteen feet, in length (Helms 1995:19, fig. 7), not to mention that visionary perception often tends toward macropsia, the enlarging of all phenomena in the visual field (Kl?ver 1928:38). In fact, most people called to the role of shaman resist its arduous responsibilities, sometimes for the better part of their lives (St. Pierre and Long Soldier 1995:178-207). The dedication to a life lived partly in the visionary state is undertaken as a solemn duty to help solve the problems of the human condition. Shamanism presupposes that extraordinary individuals are called by the spiritual realm to act as conduits between the human community and the Beyond?ideally by having the experience of travelling, usually out of their bodies, throughout the cosmos. Visionary encounters with spirit beings in the celestial and underworld realms give the shaman sacred information (herbal medicines, songs, powers of various animal spirits) that can be used to cure the body, the community, and nature itself, ensuring health, conflict resolution, and fertility on the terrestrial plane. Hence scenes of healing, with supine patients and entranced shamans seeking their cure, are found in many ancient American cultures, assuring us that these long-practiced rituals indeed took place then as they continue to today (e.g., Sharon and Donnan 1977; Berrin 1997:136, cat. no. 75). Given such a visual definition of shamanism, it appears a natural subject for art historical concern (Cordy-Collins 1977, 1980). Yet analysis usually focuses solely on the first level of shamanic iconography: identifying effigies of shamans (F?rst 1998; Reilly 1989) and the abundant images of particular visionary 4. Augustin Grefa to Michael McQuaide, personal communication 2002.</page><page sequence="5">Stone-Miller: Human-animal imagery, shamanic visions, and ancient American aesthetics 51 substances and their use.5 As support for the many ?mages of humans as animals in Maya art, recent linguistic decipherment of hieroglyphs has provided the sign and word for the animal self, the way, translated as the person's co-essence (Houston and Stuart 1989; Coe 1992:256-258; Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:190 192). Interestingly, the term "co-essence" has been cited in some modern anthropological literature as an apt characterization of the relational worldview of female shamans in contemporary northern Peru (Glass-Coffin 1998:187). Yet the visual problem posed by co-essences, the depiction of two-as-one, remains rarely approached (Stone-Miller 2002a:xxiii). Also widely represented in ancient American art are the myriad non-hallucinogenic practices that bring about the same types of visions?blood loss, dancing, drumming, chanting, singing, fasting, sensory or sleep deprivation (Siegel 1977:2). One of the most famous images is that of Lady K'ab'al Xooc (Lady Shark), whose blood loss-induced vision during her husband's accession ritual is one of five images of Vision Serpents at the Maya site of Yaxchil?n (T?te 1992:88-91), and these apparitions are celebrated elsewhere as well (fig. 3; Schele and Miller 1986:174-209). Dancers, drummers, and singers are illustrated throughout ancient American art (e.g., Freidel, Schele and Parker 1993:258-274). In more general texts, such performers are rarely described as in, or inducing, trance states. Trancing individuals may also be referenced via more subtle visual clues, as in the pronounced vertebrae of Costa Rican emaciated shaman-ascetics ?mages (e.g. Ferrero 1977:322, ill. 111-81; Paul andTurpin 1986:23; F?rst 1998:173-175; Stone-Miller 2002a:140-141, cat. no. 307). Finally, talented, experienced shamans can alter their brain waves through meditative practices alone; there are innumerable ancient American effigies of people sitting, usually with their hands on their knees (figs. 4, 5a-c, 8a; Labb? 1998:67-78). Often their eyes are shown as tight slits, pupil-less, or completely closed; visionary percepts appear to both open and closed eyes (e.g., Wasson 2001:144). Being rather "minimalist," Figure 4. Meditating Female Shaman Effigy. Central America, Costa Rica, Greater Nicoya, Rosales Zoned Engraved, Rosales Variety. Period IV, 500 b.c.-a.d. 300. Ceramic. 12%x 9 x 63/4 in.

Carlos Museum (Photograph by Michael McKelvey). these images of voluntary sensory deprivation have received slight attention, likewise the implication that they were understood to be shamans who are out of their bodies, "elsewhere," and most probably in their animal form(s). Many things are not visual "givens" in ancient American art, just as the normally hidden is held to be all the more powerful in shamanic thought.6 However these transformative visions were accomplished, they were taken as evidence of other cosmic realms whose reality and ability to reveal truth 5. These identified hallucinogen images include those of peyote (F?rst 1972:136-184), espingo seeds (Donnan 1978:130; Stone-Miller 2002:cat. nos. 516, 519), San Pedro cactus (Sharon and Donnan 1977), Banisteriopsis caapi (Cordy-Col I ins 1980), and morning-glory (F?rst 1974b), among the more than ninety vision-inducing plants indigenous to the Americas (Schultes and Hofmann 1992:66-79). The hallucinogen-excreting toad is also a recurrent ?mage (fig. 3), receiving some of its due in more recent scholarship (Davis and Weil 1992; Labb? 1998:175; Stone-Miller 2002a: 118-120, 124-125, 232, 235). 6.

(If we are not usually predisposed to agree; however, that should be irrelevant to our scholarly pursuits.)7 A contemporary Peruvian shaman recently reported to me a relevant vision in which the B. caapi plant spirit asked him, "Do you want to learn?" and he replied, "Yes." The plant enjoined him, "Then let yourself be taught," and its spirit pulled very hard on his ear and whispered into it, "Let me drink you, you don't drink me. When you drink me, you drink with your ego. If I drink you, as a plant, a pure plant, I'll show you the wisdom of all the plants." In this worldview the plants are the "bosses," as this informant called them, so the plants can "drink us" (Anonymous, personal communication 2002). Such a "turnabout" is strikingly reminiscent of the vengeful dogs and turkeys in the Popol Vuh creation story and exemplifies the shamanic understanding of an entirely animate universe. To connect modern experience with ancient art, it is important to note that visions' typical, even surprisingly predictable, overarching properties have been well documented in European accounts of the Amazonian region for hundreds of years. The sixteenth-century explorations of the "New" World report, "when the hearbe had doen his woorke he [the Prieste] did revive and awake and gaeve them their answeres according to the visions and illusions which he sawe" (Monardes 1572, quoted in Schultes and Raffauf 1992:88). Botanist Richard Spruce in the nineteenth century sampled hallucinogens (Schultes and Hofmann 1992:65), as did Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff in the 1970s, reporting similar results. Visions have been explored in the scientific literature for over seventy years; as early as 1928 Heinrich Kl?ver first published the typical mescaline experiential sequence, and more recently Siegel and others substantiated it and those of other substances (1977). Whether the subject is a Harvard undergraduate or a Tukano shaman (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975:figs. 39, 40), there is a very strong pattern to visions, a sequence of common experiences: brilliant and shifting colors and shapes, attack by predators, transformation into those and other beings, flying, seeing distant places and times, speaking to spiritual beings, and understanding the universal life force in all things (Harner 1973; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975:168- 174; Naranjo 1973). While the exact colors, animals, messages, etc., remain particular to the visionary and his or her specific vision experience, Siegel has shown that over 70 percent of subjects report an encounter with a celestial spiritual being, whether believed to be a "Sky Spirit in the Milky Way" or an "angel," according to one's cultural expectations.8 Therefore, I contend that the core values and content of visions in ancient times can be reconstructed fairly reliably because in general structure, content, and order visions have nearly universal, quite specific characteristics that often transcend the culture, time, and religious orientation of the visionary. This rather predictable hallucinatory sequence and content makes ancient American art more understandable, and all the richer in providing a context for its nearly overwhelming emphasis on multivalent imagery. What may be tiger transformation for a modern Santiagan was almost certainly jaguar co-essence in antiquity; it has been shown repeatedly that one is very likely to see large predatory animals, whether one is an urban sophisticate or a traditional rainforest dweller. While I will not attempt to account for the reasons behind these commonalities, whether physical, chemical, psychological, or spiritual (Winkelman 2000), shared visual experiences represent a significant primary source for the understanding of deeper content, values, and formal choices recurrent in ancient American art (Stone-Miller 2002a:xv-xxvi). The vast majority of visions are brilliantly colorful and feature recurring geometric patterns at the outset 7. To us the very word "hallucination" means a patently unreal figment of the imagination (Siegel 1977:2). The negative impact of our opposite worldview is typified by the recent presentation of a ceramic sculpture of a mushroom and a human (Calvo Mora et al. 1995:57, 85 [no. 26]). In two of the three photographs of this piece it is intentionally oriented upside down, the mushroom precariously balanced on its cap in order to show the human figure underneath it in an upright position. Yet the Costa Rican sculptor patently meant for the mushroom to overwhelm, invert, and alter the perspective of the tiny person literally "under its influence." As such, the viewer of the work was to experience a disorientation parallel to that felt by the trancing person; in states of altered perception, one loses the usual kinesthetic sense, feels freed from the pull of gravity, and experiences major shifts in relative and absolute scale (Kl?ver 1928:49, 38). 8. Expectations and background obviously effect visionary content. Some people do not achieve visions at all (whether from chemical, psychological, or pharmacological reasons), some do not see any large jungle animals (Dobkin de Rios 1984:126-128), others do not find spiritual meanings are revealed. However, this would have been as true in ancient times as today, given that a shaman was a special person whose visionary ability set him or her apart. This does not invalidate the independently discovered patterns of the majority of visions for the majority of people, including city-dwellers envisioning wild animals, and peoples of all faiths having revelatory, spiritual insights. It is at the level of these "patterns to the patterns" that it can be safely claimed that there are widespread human responses to states of altered consciousness.</page><page sequence="8">54 RES 45 SPRING 2004 (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975:172-173; Siegel 1977:4; Harner 1973:173). Visions almost universally then involve terrifying struggles with great predators, especially felines, snakes, and crocodilians, arguably the three most widespread natural subjects in most ancient American art (figs. 2, 5b, 10). They often progress from interaction with these animals as separate beings to the dizzying transformations of one's human form into them and many others (figs. 1, 2, 6-9 [left], 11, 12). A later hallucinatory stage typically involves flying, usually taking avian form and travelling in air but also as other beings "flying" under the sea or earth (fig 12). Visions very often culminate in a powerful feeling of emotional unity with all beings, a far-reaching recognition that all things are fully alive (Harner 1973:155-175). At almost no point do the feelings and sights correspond to an easily described, coherent, linear narrative, but rather jump and tumble in a poetic waterfall of imagery. Each of these visionary stages, and the overwhelming experience of them as a kaleidoscopic whole, appears in multiple images throughout the corpus of ancient American art.9 A few particularly overt depictions of the conflicting, impossible, odd, and disturbing nature of visions are seen in a group of Moche vessels that differ from the thousands of others in their ambivalence toward coherent beings and form itself (e.g. Berr?n 1997:116-117; Stone-Miller 2002b:114, ill. 91 ). Asymmetrical and unnerving, these "outliers" have been entitled "relief fantasy scenes" and likened to the potato people images (themselves deeply transformational). However, one "confused conglomeration of motifs" that includes sea lion, monkey, human, bird, and other "vague" bodies is described as possibly "induced by ritual consumption of the San Pedro cactus or some other psychoactive drug" (ibid.:116). Eyes emerge without entire heads, heads without bodies, and the orientations of the various partial beings differ, as opposed to the clear and complete images that characterize the rest of the Moche corpus, even if they portray composite beings (figs. 1, 6, 7). Trying to identify or name all the individual elements would be to miss the strong artistic message of liminality, unusual juxtaposition, and unprecedented transition. For example, Panamanian art features boa-like beings that nonetheless may have sting-ray or hammerhead shark heads as well as legs (Stone-Miller 2002a:cat. no. 390). Even typical Moche art, despite its seeming naturalism, often concerns itself with other levels of reality: shields Figure 6. Stirrup Spout Vessel with Jaguar-Human Figure. South America, Central Andes, North Coast, Moche. Early Intermediate Period, a.d. 1-650. Ceramic. 85/8x 6% in. (21.9 x 16.2 cm). 1989.8.164. Gift of William C. and Carol W. Thibadeau, Michael C. Carlos Museum (Photograph by Michael McKelvey). that are alive with vengeance, thousand-legged insect warriors, deer-people, and so on (Quilter 1990; Donnan 1997). Not merely vague, loosely symbolic, or metaphoric, these super-animated combinations result from the visionary revelation that all things are alive. The imagery of becoming I contend that many ?mages that combine various states of being into one simultaneous, multiple entity; embody change in form and stress becoming "Other"; or show beings that are between cultural categories, have often been misrepresented by seemingly neutral terminology. Figures that seem predominantly human are often called "ritual impersonators." This supremely hazy concept is typically used without acknowledging shamanic values. The idea that ancient American art predominantly features images of persons merely costumed as animals and/or deities is highly unsatisfying. First, it fails to see masquerading as part of an overarching preoccupation with representing the 9.

Second, the term "impersonator" implies that there is a distinction being drawn between the representation of a person and the being or force they are pretending to be (pretense figures in our definition of impersonator), as opposed to the representation of a profound unity of a human with other cosmically important forces. If, for example, a person is shown dressed as a jaguar, such a costume ritually transforms the individual from a unitary, normal human body into a multiple, supernatural one. If we further recall that in the shamanic experience everything is understood to be animate, then costumes are full of life force themselves (the Moche animated objects are a case in point; Quilter 1990). Townsend's classic study of the N?huatl term teotl, the Aztec's name for the divine sacred energy manifest in all things, shows that costumes were considered full of teotl and therefore merited special burial after use (1979:28). Certain ancient American images do make it clear that they depict a person wearing a special transformative suit, ornaments, headdress, and so on. The Maya murals in Bonampak Room 1, in fact, show dressing for a ritual as a primary subject and thus one can reconstruct exactly how the elaborate back racks and headdresses were worn (Miller 1986:69-79). In sculptural media, there may be textural shifts to differentiate layers of clothing (Berrin 1997:138, cat. no. 77), edges, or different planar levels to indicate the superimposition of masks (Abel-Vidor 1981:212, cat. nos. 196, 197), painted ties on body coverings (Stone Miller 2002a:cat. no. 163), spots on animal skin suits (Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:359), and lines to represent hems or seams (Stone-Miller 2002b:150, ill. 120). Dressed figures typically maintain some semblance of a vertical pose and their human features are at least partially visible, in other words, normal hands or feet protrude from the suit, human mouths or eyes can be glimpsed under the mask. An "x-ray" (better termed an "internal") view may be used to underscore the person within another identity (e.g., Miller 2001:36, ill. 23). The most obvious examples of clear costuming are the many Mexica images of Xipe Totee (The Flayed One), with their meticulous detailing of the skin suit's various ties, large stitches to hold the heart sacrifice tear together, scaly texture to indicate the skin suit, dangling extra hands and/or feet, and living eyes and mouth visible through the holes in the dead face (Pasztory 1983:pls. 199, 200, 267, 298; Townsend 2000:121, ill. 69). The Xipe ritual, participants, and associated imagery, however, also represent a well-documented example of ancient American ritual practice in which the symbolic and ritual motivation went far beyond mere costuming. The superimposition of dead over living body graphically reenacted the cycle of life and death via, among other things, a symbolic reference to the maize seed's miraculous springtime growth from the sloughed-off husk (ibid.). A number of images, in fact, use costume elements to place themselves so far down the continuum of transformation as to be animals masquerading as humans, such as the masked dogs of Colima (Miller 2001:55, ill. 34). Others may be seen as humans so profoundly embedded in their animal selves that only one lone item of clothing remains (figs. 6, 12). In the seated jaguar (fig. 6) the scarf suggests that it is, in fact, a completely transformed person, as do the almond shaped eyes (Stone-Miller 2002a:cat. no. 524). In the bird, the wings tied like a cape around the neck imply the same thing (fig. 12). The vision experience, as noted above, takes viewers so far from their human point of view that they adopt an animal's perspective entirely. Some modern shamanic belief further includes the idea that animals have their own animal shamans (dogs have dog shamans, jaguars have jaguar shamans), and if the same logic holds as for human shamans, these animal shamans might well have either animals (e.g. Stone Miller 2002a:155-156, cat. no. 364) or humans as their alter-egos as well (Buchillet 1992:216). Thus, who is wearing what, or whom, cannot account for the panoply of shamanic shape shifting. Admittedly there may be a large gray area in which opinions differ as to whether a given image is costumed or transformed; for example, the enigmatic masked Colima dogs might be seen as dogs' dog shamans, a human shaman in dog form, a dog dressed as a person, a dog guiding the dead (Miller 2001:56-57), or the abstract idea that dogs have souls like humans (F?rst 1998:186). Yet there certainly are ways to distinguish dress from transitional bodies, such as the absence of any delineated edges, ties, hems, planes, or textures as a starting point. Paracas embroidered figures are a prime example of the need to see clothing as only one element in a continuum of transformation. In a significant advance over the undifferentiated application of "ritual impersonator," Anne Paul and SolveigTurpin pinpointed a large subset of Paracas "Block Color" figures that represent ecstatic shamans, figures shown with bent backs, snake hair, emaciated bodies, and specific ritual paraphernalia (1986). I would add that the bent body acts to position the shaman between states, preventing gravity from claiming him in any definitive way and allowing him to participate simultaneously in human</page><page sequence="11">Stone-Miller: Human-animal imagery, shamanic visions, and ancient American aesthetics 57 Figure 8.

Rear view bodily vertically and animal corporeal horizontality. His torso, impossibly shown clothed and with the emaciated ribs below, only becomes possible in the visionary realm in which the perceived essence of an entity wins out over its surface appearance (Stone-Miller 2002a:xv ff.). Based on Raul and Turpin's important work, I would further suggest that the majority of the Paracas figures depict one form of shaman or another. Variation in the figures' body and limb positioning, the shape of their feet, and their costumes help establish how relatively animal-transformed they are in a given image. In an informal survey of thirty-one Block Color embroidered figures, several combinations of human and animal features became apparent. In the first grouping, most vertically positioned figures (arguably a characteristically human, bipedal pose) had human feet as well (flat bottomed ones perpendicular to the leg with toes at the front only [e.g., Stone-Miller 1994:83]).10 These are the few candidates for a "costumed-human shaman" category. However, a number of these upright figures had what can be characterized as animal feet, in which a digit curls down from the back of the heel. Although perhaps closest to monkey feet with their thumb-like back toe, some of these non-human feet possess very long, curled, pointed "toes," unlike those of primates. These sharp digits may stand for the arrangement of talons on raptorial birds (a single talon at the back of the 10. Upright can be pertinent to certain animals, however, such as the butterfly or the monkey, though standing with head, hips, shoulders, and feet aligned is a human characteristic. Birds go both ways; their bodies are often horizontal yet their feet hang down.</page><page sequence="12">58 RES 45 SPRING 2004 foot occurs in ospreys, condors, and others [Poole 1989:78, fig. 5.3; 78-81; 87]). They also resemble the feline dewclaw that facilitates tree climbing (Wolfe and Sleeper 1995:17). These multi-animal, but decidedly non-human, feet are shown as crescent shaped and hang straight down from the leg; not being flat or perpendicular to the body or the "ground," they do not convey the possibility of standing upon them. The bird-in-flight foot thus seems to supercede other interpretations. There are never any indications that this foot is actually a shoe or boot (no color distinction or line crosses the ankle and the protruding back talon makes an unlikely shape for footwear; by contrast, Maya jaguar skin sandals come to mind as clearly delineated). Thus, some of the most otherwise "human" Paracas figures have a fundamentally transformed part of their body, an animal foot that tellingly propels them out of normal human gravitational space. A second grouping of Paracas figures all have horizontally positioned bodies (the inherent position of cats, reptiles, snakes, and many, if not most, animals) along with animal feet, suggesting that these represent even more relatively transformed shamans. A sideways body plus non-weight-bearing feet visually reinforce the sense of suspension, flying, and being beyond the human pull of gravity. Flying is, of course, the staple experience of the vision state (Harner 1973:158-160). Images in which the two human legs hang down from the body absolutely mimic the position of many birds' legs in flight. When all four arms and legs are shown to dangle, human position can likewise approach the orientation of the four limbs of felines, crocodiles, lizards, etc. Not only Paracas but also Nasca and Moche images use this device of dangling limbs to present the transitional image in liminal space (Hornor n.d.; Donnan 1992:50, fig. 85; Berrin 1997:146, cat. no. 86; 147). Some figures do not fall easily into any of these three categories (upright humans with human feet, upright humans with animal feet, sideways humans with animal feet). In terms of body position, figures may be upright in their body but have a sideways head, or vice versa. This may be seen as a less extreme version of the bent back pose of Raul and Turpin's ecstatic shaman, another way to defy normal gravity, to show the experiential state of becoming. Disjunction between head and body position may also be another reference to animal capabilities. For instance, birds can cock their heads sideways in extreme ways (Juniper and P?rr 1998:69, right) and normally horizontal animals can raise their heads high up from their backs, as when crocodiles bellow (Ross 1989:115-117), or dramatically down from their necks, as when jaguars stalk (Perry 1970:51, 69). Interestingly, the bent-back shamans, whose bodies are neither horizontal nor vertical, are almost all human footed. Thus, the presentation of one element that is physically "impossible" in this reality is often balanced by one that is "possible"; this artistic strategy seemingly solves the problem of showing a figure as fundamentally two things at once. It also may help signal that the shaman who seems to be on this plane is actually elsewhere (or "elsewhen"). At the core of shamanic art is the paradox?at least for us?that a shaman is a person, yet at that moment is not in a human state. Hence to juxtapose parts of the body that inhabit different states of being captures this experiential concept of multiple simultaneous presences. Combination of opposites likewise encapsulates the shaman's mediating role in the cosmic landscape. Although the term "ritual impersonator" no longer suffices, especially given these impossible views, poses, and non-human body parts, identifying precisely what constitutes costume remains problematical with Paracas figures. Some elements that are commonly interpreted as costumes or accessories may well be other things. The "batons" held by many figures, especially ecstatic shamans, look suspiciously like entheogenic mushrooms (Cantrell n.d.). In one example (Stone-Miller 1994:84-85, color pi. 11), for instance, the curved, high-pitched triangular tops, long thin stems, and dark lines between the two capture the main features of the psilocybin mushroom very succinctly (Schultes and Hofmann 1992:54). Many other figures wear what seem to be giant costumes, in which regular tunics, loincloths, arms, legs, and perhaps some facial features are recognizable below or under their enormous headdresses (e.g., Lavalle and Lang 1983:117). While they are realistically shown, the very grand scale of these outfits raises some doubt as to which reality they inhabit. Despite the thousands of delicate Paracas textiles preserved in the desert sands, none of these cloth sharks or falcon costumes has survived. In general, it is rarely clear whether a given face is non-human or that of a painted or masked person, or whether a given figure is wearing a cape or has wings (Stone-Miller 1994:79-81, color pis. 8a, b; Lavalle and Lang 1983:89). Again, since extreme facial treatments seek to change the human visage to "Other" (usually via colorful pattern and/or feline whiskers, both shamanic elements) and since the capes do give the figure "wings," these distinctions seem more pressing to us than they probably were to the makers of such intentionally and creatively enigmatic images.</page><page sequence="13">Stone-Miller: Human-animal imagery, shamanic visions, and ancient American aesthetics 59 Some of the most telling pieces of the puzzle are the plethora of emanations that erupt from all body and costume parts, wind around in space, and end most often in snakes, but also in other animals, human heads, or complete figures. Given visionary spirituality, this aesthetic choice is not surprising: During trances any sinuous element, such as one's own hair or fingers or the branches of a tree, may become a snake or another such being. The depicted emanations often defy identification as exuberant costuming because they link directly to the body itself. In particular, if they were huge pendants sewn onto tunics, besides never being found archaeologically, how would they curve upwards, writhe, and float around the body in gravity-defying splendor? Fantastical bodily emanations, especially snakes, are one of the core diagnostic features of shamanic imagery (figs. 2, 3; Cordy-Collins 1980; F?rst 1998:173). Almost all ancient American styles include figures emanating snakes in one form or another. To name but a few instances, snakes emerge from the head of figures at Chav?n de Huantar and Tiwanaku (Stone Miller 2002b:32, 34, 38, 39, 132, 133); they are the tongues and arms of Calima effigies (Labb? 1986:55, figs 46, 47; 67, color plate V); at least one Costa Rican toad effigy dons a two-headed snake (fig. 3b), and Maya rulers hold the double-headed snake bar, perhaps the Vision Serpent itself, as their prime insignia of politico spiritual power (Miller 1999:111, ill. 86). As a terrestrial animal, the constant molting of the snake obviously embodies transformation itself. However, the molting snake can be taken further as a prime shamanic emanation based on the corporeal animal as it appears in this world. The double-headed snake, found so frequently in the corpus of ancient American art, does not have to be viewed as purely symbolic (as did F?rst 1998:173). There are two ways in which a double-headed snake can be transferred to art directly from the observation of nature and thus can exist in the trancing shaman's memory. At the beginning of a snake's molting process its old, shadowy skin head and its newly revealed solid head are actually adjacent to one another (Mattison 1986:73). Later in the process, the old head travels down the body to lodge briefly at the tail before being fully sloughed off as part of the entire inside-out skin. Thus, these two versions of a truly "two-headed" snake exist, as magical yet real moments of multiplicity within natural cycles. Both types of double snakes are depicted in art: a Costa Rican entheogenic toad image displays the side-by-side-head type (fig. 3b), while the Maya serpent bar and Vision Serpent in Yaxchil?n Lintel 25 represent the heads-at both-ends type, to name only two instances. A second, even more bizarre natural occurrence of two-headed snakes consists of mutants, snakes whose single bodies erupt into two independent heads (Cunningham 1937).11 Such snakes may have two heads and one tail, the most common type, or one head and two tails, or two heads and two tails. While admittedly not an everyday sighting, word of these memorable mutations would no doubt spread in ancient times as it does today. Be that as it may, snakes come with two heads in nature, whether about six times a year as they molt or for a full year (the normal lifespan of the two-headed snake), just as they purport to in the supernatural realm. "Many headedness," in the sense of a person emanating other heads or a snake with an extra one, may be a particularly succinct way to depict a multiplicity of being states. In sum, I would argue that Paracas imagery depicts many shamans, not simply one. The same can be said for Nasca imagery (Hornor n.d.), and that of Moche (Sharon and Donnan 1977), West Mexican (F?rst 1998), Maya (Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993), and many other cultures of the ancient Americas. Such a contention does not mean that every ancient American image is that of a shaman (fig. 9, right; see below), neither does the ubiquity of images compromise the special nature of individual shamans. In fact, the myriad images of shamans in divergent styles correspond to the cross cultural pattern that shamans have quite specific specialties and are differentiated as to their types and levels of expertise. Shamans universally seem to specialize in soul retrieval, childbirth, or the fertility of particular animals, to name a few (e.g. Buchillet 1992:212). This could help account for the iconographie variety of figures, with whale-shamans being held responsible for fish fertility and butterfly-shamans for successful pollination. In terms of proficiency, there also seems to be a differentiation of levels of shamanic power and ability, garnered in long, arduous apprenticeships and demonstrated in numerous vision experiences associated with high rates of cure. One's level of expertise could be shown in the relative amount of costumed versus transformed body, i.e., the attainment of the full animal self, and in the relative horizontality of the overall position, i.e., flying prowess. For instance, the modern but traditional Siona of Colombia distinguish 11. Hundreds have been documented, from ancient Greek accounts to worldwide web reports to a recent children's publication, the November 2003 Scholastic Reader. They occur about one in 10,000 births.</page><page sequence="14">60 RES 45 SPRING 2004 between "only a man" (the uninitiated or neophyte), "one who has left" (a mid-level shaman), and "a seer" (a master shaman) (Langdon 1992:53). "Left," to them, refers to the ability to leave one's physical body and fly through the cosmos. Perhaps the intricacies of body position, foot type, costuming, and emanations in Paracas embroideries were a precise visual coding of such carefully delineated shamanic arts. The experience of animal transformation posed a fascinating and inspiring problem for all ancient American artists to solve: freed of the limitations of normal representation, the human-animal continuum engages the imagination and pushes the creative mind to new heights (as the visions did the shamans' minds). As a basis for an aesthetic, shamanism is fantastic, in both senses of the word. It is important to see that these many artists solved the common problem of depicting this visionary-based continuum of animals and humans in many divergent ways. Mesoamerican, Costa Rican, and Central Andean cultures all focussed their skills on the interface of human with key visionary animals, particularly the jaguar, crocodile, toad, snake, and bird. Here I will add only a few examples involving the ubiquitous jaguar and taken from the Michael C. Carlos Museum collection (see also Stone-Miller 2002a). As with Paracas figures, artists first must choose between human verticality and animal horizontality, although there are bridging poses, such as humans sitting or kneeling in a feline manner (interestingly, Olmec transformational figures that are more human in character take a feline stance and only take a human standing position as they become more feline; see Reilly 1989:13-15). In fact, this cat position that people emulate, with their hands in front like the front legs and their kneeling legs like the back legs, may be a latent message of human-feline overlap in the scarf-wearing jaguar (fig. 6). Many shamanic objects tend to adopt the opposite: an impossibly human bipedal position for an animal. The Costa Rican Rataky-style jaguar effigy (figs. 8a, b) places its front paws like hands on the non existent "knees" of back legs, as does the jaguar side of the Maya incensario lid dual figure (fig. 5b). Thus, an animal can be made to adopt the shamanic meditation pose so common in human ?mages (figs. 2, 4). Not surprisingly in a visions-oriented spiritual system, an especially revealing focus of bodily transformation seems to involve the eyes. Eyes may read as human by taking shapes other than round, especially almond (figs. 1, 4-7, 9, 10, 12), and by having the whites differentiated from the pupils (figs. 1, 4-7). Human eyes may bulge exaggeratedly, as in the two faces on the base Figure 9. Left. Female Figure with Jaguar Features. Central America, Costa Rica, Diquis. Period VI, a.D. 1000-1520.

In order to be read as "animal," however, eyes must be fundamentally round (figs. 2, 3, 5), as are those of terrestrial birds, cats, reptiles, and amphibians, the ones that figure prominently in visions. The pupil is commonly enlarged in states of altered consciousness (fig. 7), so by choosing a circular eye an artist may be emphasizing the vision state as much as accurately rendering a specific animal's visual apparatus. Also, to be creatively liminal, artists may make eyes transitional (figs. 8, 11), such as oval (between almond-shaped and round) and concentrically outlined, as are jaguar eyes</page><page sequence="15">Stone-Miller: Human-animal imagery, shamanic visions, and ancient American aesthetics 61 Figure 10.

Carlos Museum (Photograph by Michael McKelvey). (by the dark fur around them) and human eyes (by eyelashes). Artists may add characteristics that occur in neither humans nor animals, such as the orange dots in the corners of all the eyes in figure 5. This is one of any number of methods to indicate special sight abilities by creating special eyes. Separate animal and human figures may share similar special eyes, while other human figures do not, so as to show one person as animal-transformed and the other as normal (figs. 9 [left, right], vis-?-vis 10). In shamanic art, images of powerful humans seem to adopt animal eyes in part because jaguars and other predators have eyesight far superior to that of humans, especially at night when humans are most vulnerable and shamanic rituals take place. Many of the animals prominent in the tropical American shamanic cultures and their imagery are physically endowed with the tapetum lucidum (a membrane behind the retina that reflects light back into the eye so as to multiply dramatically the ability to see in low-light situations) including felines, crocodilians, owls, and various other nocturnal animals (Ross 1989:56; Gilbert 1997:105). Such eerie, mirror-reflecting eyes represent the shamanic visionary experience at various levels: from referencing the point of view of animals ("I saw only necks") to the fear felt prey (when the glinting eyes of the predator capture you in their sight), and from seeing well in the dark (shamans have brilliant visions at night) to the Other Side as a mirror reflection of this one (Saunders 1988, 1990; Stone-Miller 2002a:xxvi). Many transformational human-animal images originally may have had shiny inlaid eyes, as suggested for Olmec statuary (Reilly 1989:8). Besides eyes, various other features may be effectively altered or conflated in these artistic meldings, such as human ears on a crocodile (fig. 11), bared teeth on humans (figs. 9, left; 10), and abstract pelt/body markings including jaguar's lower limb stripes (figs. 6-10; Perry 1970:69). The challenges inherent in depicting humans with animal selves can inspire artists to show a multiple being as multi-sided. Shamans' profoundly dual selves may have their human and animal sides rendered literally as two things, as in a rare early Classic Maya incensario (figs. 5a-c). The welded back-to-back lid figures unite a sun divinity in its old man form with its jaguar way or animal spirit double. Both sit upright in the exact same, fully human pose, the kingly "posture of</page><page sequence="16">62 RES 45 SPRING 2004 royal ease" (Schaffer 1991).12 Significantly, each figure has its right leg bent and its left leg dangling, so that they patently do not take mirror-image positions; the clear artistic message is that they are duplicate aspects of one being. However, the jaguar self takes a certain precedence in this composition: when looking at the sun divinity half, one sees him as having both his human ears and the round animal ears of his feline way (like the two sets of ears on some Olmec transformation figures; Reilly 1989:12, fig. 13). On another level, this piece hieroglyphically embodies the broad concept of the animal self: it is perhaps the most literal, three dimensional version of the way glyph known, complete with wavy intersection where spots give way to skin (compare fig. 5c to Houston and Stuart 1989:3, fig. 1). Although the idea of the co-essence is so culturally and spiritually central, images as overt as this are very unusual in Maya art and in ancient American aesthetics as a whole. Indeed, perhaps the idea of the animal spirit was so fundamental that it did not necessitate such obvious explication very often, even by the documentary-minded Maya. However, this piece takes one step beyond duality, representing the fact that Maya notions of transformation involved complex relationships of human, divine, and animal ways (Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:190-192). The two human faces on either side of the base suggest that the dual figure lid represents a vision in the human shaman's likewise impossibly dual head. Humans become animals, animals become divinities, and divinities have human forms. As mentioned above, all the eyes in the composition are bulging and entranced, with orange dots in the corners, a special characteristic found in neither jaguar nor human eyes. Eyes serve here to reinforce the idea that all four of these images, two human, one supernatural, and one animal, are aspects of each other and all fall well outside of earthly parameters. Two Costa Rican solutions to the jaguar-human problem differ from this Maya one in interesting ways. The Rataky-style piece (fig. 8), a high-quality example of a fairly common type from later northwestern Costa Rica and southwestern Nicaragua, is almost completely jaguar in form except for the vertical body position that posits its front paws as "hands" on the "knees" of its back ones. This telltale posture of shamanic trance or meditation echoes that of the lid figures of the Maya piece and many others (figs. 2, 4). Other features are somewhat transitional, for instance, the protruding humanoid nose and the not-quite-round eyes. Certainly the selective placement of decoration only on the limbs, around the neck of the figure, the vessel rim, and down the back, are not "realistic," as jaguars are spotted all over their bodies, with the lighter belly and darker back (as clearly delineated in fig. 5b). However, since visionary blending of human and feline has already rendered this a transformed shaman, then terrestrial sorts of realism by definition are not paramount. In shamanic art realism is always selective (for example, in the Maya incensario the dark line differentiating darker from lighter areas is not found on actual jaguars). There are creative elements that speak to the essence of the jaguar, however, such as the fact that the spots are actually tiny abstract jaguars themselves (especially visible on the proper right upper leg). Perhaps this idiosyncratic treatment of the rosettes conveys that the shaman in animal mode has the power of "jaguar concentrate." In addition, when moved, the piece produces a strong rattle from the movement of clay balls in the hollow legs and the mouth cavity. The sound is strikingly like the actual low grumbling voice of the jaguar (Krause 1996).13 Its head is positioned low on the vessel/body as seen in the predatory cat when it growls and lowers its head to stalk its prey (Perry 1970:51). Even the stripes on the lower parts of the four limbs, which might seem fanciful in a spotted cat, have a basis in actual jaguar markings: small spots often meld into stripes there and on the chest or head (ibid:106), perhaps the origin of the otherwise fanciful spotted area around the head (figs. 9, 10; Perry 1970:69; jaguars do not have manes or ruffs to which this zigzag area might refer). This piece aptly shows how the ancient American artist, although freed by visionary fluidity from strict adherence to normal appearances, selectively undertook to convey important aspects of the natural subject even in a transformational being. Another style and medium of ancient Costa Rica, Diquis stonework of the southwestern zone (figs. 9, 10), shows us that in some cases only a comparison between separate human and jaguar effigies can reveal the precise character of their shamanic interdigitation. The male figure (fig. 9, right) betrays no animal characteristics and has crescent-shaped eyes, a variant on the more typical almond-shaped human eyes. However, the female in figure 9, left (identifiable by her breasts) and the feline effigy in figure 10 share slanted almond-shaped eyes, 12. Incidentally, this piece represents a missing link between the Olmec and the Late Classic Maya images of this important posture (Stone-Miller 2002a:cat. no. 1). 13. The jaguar's vocalizations can be heard around the fourth minute of the recording.</page><page sequence="17">Stone-Miller: Human-animal imagery, shamanic visions, and ancient American aesthetics 63 double stripes on lower limbs, whiskers, and bared teeth. By looking at all three sculptures together, it becomes obvious that the woman is "jaguar-ized," while the man is not.14 The effigies in figures 2 and 4 are also female, as are other shaman images in the Carlos collection (Stone-Miller 2002:cat. nos. 428, 431) and elsewhere (Day and Tillett 1996). Shamanism is based on a belief that the supernatural realm calls individuals to become cosmic mediators, rather than that society elects its spiritual leaders or individuals choose their vocations. Thus, it allows for female spiritual calling and possession of significant power even in male-dominated political organizations (e.g. Glass-Coffin 1998; St. Pierre and Long Soldier 1995). Two final Central Andean Moche jaguar-human images include the aforementioned scarf-wearer that sits at the animal end of the continuum (fig. 6) and another in which jaguar transformation is alluded to in the headdress and the fanged mouth (fig. 7). The seated feline?four-legged, horizontal, spotted, and with accurately observed round ears?seems to be all jaguar at first glance. However, it wears a scarf or necklace around its neck, a contrasting-colored, distinctly edged item raised to a higher level than the vessel surface. It therefore fits the more strict criteria for a costume element presented above. In addition, actual jaguars do not have plain or differentially marked neck fur to which this could refer. The figure also has clearly human shaped almond eyes. This masterful effigy eerily conveys the shamanic experience of a person looking out from within a jaguar body. Another aspect bespeaks typical transformational reversals: the spots are painted as light on a darker body, whereas real jaguars have black rosettes on light coats. The reversed world, in which everyday coloration does not apply to the blinding vision state, is aptly communicated. Finally, the human head of a Chav?n-revival Moche fanged face goblet (fig. 7) dons a jaguar headdress, its growling head at the center of the forehead and oversized paws toward the temples. The artist added bulging eyes and deadly, feline crossed fangs, an Andean visual shorthand for the animal transformation state. It is clearly an entranced shaman, whose wing-like red face paint may abstractly connote flying. The terrifying growl of the jaguar is evoked by the rattling clay balls in this piece's hollow neck/handle. Brew of some kind could be drunk from Figure 11. Crocodile-Human Head Seat.

While confronting a shamanic universal, the artists nevertheless betrayed their own and their particular culture's approaches and assumptions. The Maya ?mage is the most additive, juxtaposing a jaguar-person, a deity-person, and a shaman-person on different sides of the composition. Separate figures, especially anthropocentric ones, arguably hold more sway in Maya art than elsewhere (Miller 1999:150-167). 14. It is important to note that it is not particularly unusual for a female to be shown as a shaman, especially in the Intermediate Area (Labb? 1998:28, 41, 54, 59 [figs. 34, 36], 60, 63 [no. 41], 103 [no. 82], 107, 108, 133 [no. 107]). 15. The goblet's interior residue tested negative for human blood. It has not been tested for B. caapi, as the amount of remaining residue is too small to produce conclusive results.</page><page sequence="18">64 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 12. Flute in the Form of a Bird-Transformed Shaman. Central America, Costa Rica, Greater Nicoya, Mora Polychrome, Guabal Variety. Period V-Period VI, a.D. 800-1200. Ceramic. 31/2 x 21/2 x 81/2 diam. in.

This may be a more favored Maya, perhaps even more characteristically Mesoamerican, formal solution that could be termed "additive duality." By contrast, Costa Rican versions seem to prefer what could be called "embedded duality," two beings within one body, whether proportionately favoring the jaguar (figs. 8a, b) or the human (fig. 9, left) to frame the "Other." The non shamanic human is patently left out of this liminal status, "only a man" rather than a multiple being. In these few examples at least, the Andean images also nest more than one being in a single body, and often leave only one bit of the Other?an eye or a mouth?as a reminder of the transformed state. Of course, no one piece or two works of art can represent an entire culture area. For instance, although still typically combining animal and human in the same body, there are numerous other Moche- and other Andean-style images of transitional states of being that chose other modes, perhaps the dominant one being human bodies with animal heads, such as the famous owl-headed shaman (Sharon and Donnan 1977:380, left). It remains for a full-scale study to compare a significant number of different ancient American versions of animal transformation, and to include plant beings (such as fig. 1; Stone-Miller 2002a:cat. no. 521) and animate objects (Berrin 1997:154; Quilter 1990), two additional shamanic ?mages of multiplicity. I hope to have suggested here that ancient American art confronted the paradoxical nature of visionary imagery when it took on the problems of depicting becoming rather than being. Since visions are by definition out of the ordinary, and specific visions will have their own character despite common features, there can be no singular way to show animal transformation. Ancient American artists of many stylistic traditions, perhaps in reflection of larger cultural predispositions, chose among the many possible modes in which to call into question the unitary human form. It remains for a more ambitious study to fully elaborate the Amerindian predilection for amalgams of animals and persons. These rich ?mages of non-corporeal human bodies, simultaneous beings, sightless eyes seeing myriad wonders, and feet that never touch down seek to represent the paradoxical realities of the Other Side as experienced in shamanic trance. It may behoove us to accommodate "seeing only necks" or "having the plants drink us" in order to reconstruct more appropriately the ancient American artistic sensibility.</page><page sequence="19">Stone-Miller: Human-animal imagery, shamanic visions, and ancient American aesthetics 65 BIBLIOGRAPHY Abel-Vidor, Suzanne, et al. 1981 Between Continents/Between Seas: Precolumbian Art of Costa Rica.
