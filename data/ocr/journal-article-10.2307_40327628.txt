<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aboriginal Australian and Tasmanian Rock Carvings and Paintings. By D. S. Davidson. (Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society. Vol. V. 1936. Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press. Pp. 1-151. Price in Australia 14/9. All students of the art, past and present, of the aborigines of Australia will be grateful to Dr. Davidson for this survey of the types and distribution of native carvings and paintings. The book is well illustrated both by drawings, photographs and coloured plates, and the significance, or suggested significance, of the paintings and carvings is given wherever possible. In this connection the author emphasizes the fact that though the art of rock carving seems now* to be</page><page sequence="2">400 REVIEWS extinct, that of rock painting is practised, and so it is still possible in some regions to obtain the meaning of the paintings. The most interesting part of the book is, therefore, his brief description of the rock paintings at the lightning and rain totemic centres of the Wardaman tribe, whom Dr. Davidson visited. Though there is obviously room for further investigations into the subject even here, the author was satisfied that- the chief paintings at the lightning centre, representing two brothers, cultùrè-heroes, are part and parcel of the religious and social organization of the tribe. These brothers and the wife of the married one have their definite places in the subsection and kinship systems of the tribe. They introduced sub- incisiòn and now visit the centre during the rainy seasons. The paintings are said to have been the work of these heroes themselves. They are obviously retouched, no doubt at the beginning of the rainy season, as in the case of the Wondjina paintings of Northern Kimberley, but the author did not elicit any information on this matter. One interesting fact was gleaned, that the home of the chief lightning brother is beyond Hall's Creek, that is in northern Kimberley (not western as the author writes). Further in the nearby rain totem centre a painting is found which rain is said to have brought from Hall's Creek. The object depicted is said to be something like a yam, but not found locally. As a few pictures somewhat of the Wondjina type (vide Davidson, pp. 124-132, and A. P. Elkin, " Rock-Paintings of North- West Australia," Oceania, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 257-79) have recently been found east and south of Wyndham, showing signs of retouching, we may accept the tentative conclusion that a certain type of totemic art, closely associated with the representation and retouching of human figures, originated in the Northern Kimberley and spread eastwards over the North Australian border. Dr. Davidson would apparently be prepared to agree with this, though he might not also agree that the subsection system and subincision have likewise spread into the same region from Eastern Kimberley, but I believe there is sufficient evidence to prove this. Let us hope that Dr. Davidson will publish any material he has on the social organization of the tribes of Northern Australia visited by him. I am sure that he will be interested to learn that though the art of rock-carving is no longer practised, I have one informant in New South Wales of high rank in the secret life, to whom some of the carvings in the Hawkesbury-Hunter district are an open book ; some are historical records, some represent the totems of the local group, and others deal with the secret life. This will be published later. The author is right in saying that the Wondjina paintings are basically similar in type to paintings and carvings of anthropomorphic type in many parts of the continent, and postponing the question of ultimate origin until more research in the field has taken place. I have referred mainly to the author's discussion of rock paintings in areas where the art is still practised, but the other parts of the book make us realize that Australia has a human pre-history which, as usual, is full of interesting problems. Dr. Davidson has enabled us to see the subject as a whole, and for this service we welcome his painstaking survey. A. P. Elkin</page></plain_text>
