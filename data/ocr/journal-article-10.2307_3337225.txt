LU LU 0 Cz avuna Simon was an evangelist and leading member of the Swedish Protestant Mission in Lower Congo at the turn of the century. He was one of a number of members of the newly emer- gent literate class who undertook ethnographic research in collaboration with the missionary K.E. Laman between 1916 and 1917, when he may have been about 35 years old (MacGaffey 1991:1-7). The project, as Laman put it, was intended to record Kongo culture for future generations of the people (Janzen 1972:12-28; MacGaffey 1986:263-79). It resulted in 10,000 manu- script pages, in Kikongo, of which a digest appeared in English as the four volumes of Laman's The Kongo (Uppsala, 1953-1967). The manuscripts repose in the National Archives of Sweden.1 Little is known about any of the authors, except that they were leading evangelists in the pioneering expansion of Protestantism and that they wrote in a spirit of enthusiasm for an ancestral culture whose transformation they were experiencing. We know that in 1910 Kavuna wrote an article in the mission bulletin on the nationalistic theme of respect for the Kikongo language. His writing is often extra- ordinarily vivid in its evocation of Kongo culture as it was at the beginning of this century. In the text that follows he writes about the form and composition of two well-known and related types of North- ern Kongo art, muzidi (pl. mizidi) and the much larger kimbi (also bimbi), generally known in the ethnographic literature as niombo.2 The text shows that the smaller was prepared by an expert, nganga (pl. banganga), in a dramatic ritual performance, when a family Opposite page: 1.

Each was deemed to contain and be empowered by the spirit or ghost, called nkuyu in this dialect (pl. bankuyu), of the individual in question. As a container of spiritual force, these reliquaries resemble the most numerous and best-documented types of Kongo art, minkisi (sing. nkisi). The difference between them is that the clients of an nkisi are persons who have been afflicted by the misfortune that the particular nkisi is believed to control, or else those who seek benefits from it. Muzidi on the other hand is composed, as Kavuna tells us, by a fam- ily in need of protection, and its animating spirit is that of an ances- tral figure rather than one identified with a particular disease or other problem. Kimbi is composed by a local group to make the remains of their deceased chief into a kind of guardian spirit. The empowerment of an nkisi was effected by the incorporation of "medicines" (bilongo) which specified its particular capacities to con- trol this or that disease, for example, but a kimbi or muzidi included a force particularized by name and by its relationship to the group. Kimbi contained the actual bones of the deceased chief, but the ancestral pres- ence in muzidi had to be induced by the ritual Kavuna describes. Once this spirit had been "captured" in an anthropomorphic wooden or cloth- bound figure, the figure was no longer called muzidi but nkuyu (pl. minkuyu).3 Medicines were not necessary, although some of the wood- en versions now in museums have medicines attached to them, probably because the figure had been converted from its original purpose. Once a figure was deemed to be no longer effective (because the ancestral spirit had "left"), it reverted to the status of an ordinary object.4 Wyatt MacGaffey african arts * spring 1995 49</page><page sequence="2">7,4;: 4-7 a 2: C:A I?V-,~,r ?:::::: __::_;~ :: I I?

They are made to look after their clansmen who have set them up, since it is the bankuyu who safeguard living people from diseases of all kinds. They look after the livestock and the houses of their fellow clansmen. They especially care for the lives of their rela- tives so that they shall not be cursed or hexed by witches. Bankuyu have the power to curse people, the power to hex people and to inflict disease and to remove it. People under- stand about witchcraft and sorcery and therefore are eager to prepare minkuyu and keep them in the houses where they sleep or in special storage places. They think that having an nkuyu guarantees the body against dangers by protecting it and sacral- izing it and the life of the person. For in minkuyu there is great benefit for the body and blessing for both people and animals; in them there are safeguards for the body. Not everybody in the village has minkuyu, only those who have bad luck or physical problems. For example, their crops or their livestock are not doing well, they have no luck killing ani- mals in the bush when hunting, or when buying and selling goods, or they are not able to have children. If someone has been married a year or two and has not been able to have chil- dren, then he wants to know why this is. Or maybe he has had children but he can't count on it, the children keep dying off; then too he will want to know what's the matter. Or suppose he hunts with a gun but is unable to track game and kill it, or though he finds game and shoots it the animal just leaves blood and doesn't die, then too he will desire to know the reason. Sometimes one is just not well: he's sick off and on, he has nightmares and bad dreams. Later, things startle him night and day and he has no strength in his body; impotence in a man, for example. It may happen that a man has been well able to sleep with a woman but later his penis no longer seems to have any strength, it's dead, it can no longer hold itself up or, it does when he's hot but when he turns to his wife it droops and goes limp. On this account quarrels and anger break out daily between husband and wife. Finally the problem becomes public. For this reason a man will want to know why his penis has died. Likewise a woman who fails to stop bleeding at the time when she menstru- ates and should have stopped will want to know what the matter is. However the problem arises, one wants to know the reason. To know the reasons they will also need a diviner to explain them. They cannot buy or order a muzidi from one who puts them together if they do not know the hidden resentments in the village. So thinking, they seek out a diviner. When the diviner has sniffed and smelled through the whole village, the women and the men, the living and the dead, on whichever side he experiences trembling, there he knows there is trouble. If among the dead, then he must discover who it is and why he is angry that he should be coming back to the village to make trouble in this way. When the diviner understands that such and such a dead person wants a muzidi or a wooden figure (kiteki), then they need permission to order the muzidi or figurine made; [that will cost] a "chicken" [in the form]s of one raffia cloth (lubongo), 50 Top: 2.

The cost of the muzidi will be a "chicken" of three raffia cloths, or one and a half francs today. What are they made of? There are two kinds, of wood or of grass and leaves. When they want to make a muzidi they need palm-leaf ribs. They split them, scrape them thoroughly to make them supple and thin, then weave a little piece of fiber which they twist inside and arrange so that it strengthens the muzidi and makes it stiff. Next, cut dry banana-leaf fibers, weave some into the trunk and others into the arms and legs. With others they make the neck. At the head they put bunches of ndubi leaves which have been scraped with a knife.6 Then they crush dry leaves and put them in the head and the neck. Then they stitch a bag out of local mbadi cloth or palm fiber. That's how they make a muzidi. It is made in the image of a per- son. They put a nose, eyes, and for pupils in the eyes they put bits of the mbungu amputu beetle or small white or red shells, or some other color. Then ears and a mouth and teeth are made from mbota roots; they carve them carefully, split them and put them in the mouth in the upper and lower jaws. Legs and arms and five toes on each foot, five fingers on each hand. They do the same with a kiteki, putting hands and feet, a head, eyes, penis, testicles, fingers and toes, nose and mouth, but no teeth.7 They make figurines out of wood, nlala [orange] wood or nlembanzau [Gardenia jovistonantis] or luhete [Hymenocardia acida Tul.=Euphorbiaceael. Muzidi and figurine are made in the same way, and for the same purpose, to look after people and to curse. Muzidi and figurine are the houses minkuyu prefer to settle and stay in. When a muzidi is vacant, when no nkuyu has entered it, it is just a shell, commanding no respect or confidence. It cannot be put near crops to scare off animals that come to eat a woman's harvest. But a muzidi when an nkuyu has entered into it is called nkuyu. The muzidi itself is not the nkuyu. Similarly, in the case of a wooden figurine, if no nkuyu has entered it is just an image, but when a spirit of the dead has entered it then it is called nkuyu. When the minkuyu are in the figurines or mizidi it isn't finished, because they then seek some sort of protective device, such as one of several sorts of little basket, a bag, or a carrying sling for a child. These things are used to protect and to carry the minkuyu. Catching the Nkuyu It may happen that the nkuyu arrives, under the influence of the medicated palm wine and the food that have been put out for him, but refuses to be fixed by the nganga or his assistant, who is in a state of possession. He flat refuses to go in, and hides wherever he feels like, perhaps in the house, under the drum, under plantain roots in the forest, maybe under the feet of those of his living relatives who are sitting around at the ceremony. He torments the nganga and gives him a really rough time of it. When the nganga has failed, by humble inducements and pres- ents of food and drink, to make him go in, at last he goes after him himself with his mpiya [diviner's whisk] in his hand.8 If the nkuyu is exceptionally coy, two banganga help each other to catch him. While one of them goes after him the other watches when he draws near so that when he is close to the basket he can grab him and tie a piece of cloth over the opening and shut it tight. When he is fixing it he shakes his mpiya this way and that, wherever the nkuyu goes. He is in trance during the operation, so that whether the nkuyu goes way up high or way down low the person in trance follows him. Even though he should leap to a housetop or climb a tree, it is no problem for the nganga to fol- low, because he has his mpiya, into which has already entered a tough, strong, wily and smart nkuyu eager for the pursuit. Therefore the nganga cannot fail to catch and grab the nkuyu, on account of the nkuyu-strength in mpiya. When he puts him in, the nganga may hold him tight in his hand or in a packet of green banana leaves, or perhaps in a peanut basket. If the nkuyu is scared of the noise made by the nganga and the nkuyu-powers in the mpiya, the nganga may be obliged to go in with it himself. That is the kind of difficulty the banganga may have if the nkuyu does not want to enter. That is what happens when nkuyu is to be put in a small bas- ket. When they put one in a muzidi or kiteki, this is what they do. They find a diviner, nganga ngombo. When he comes he first divines to find out whether the nkuyu wants to enter a figurine or a muzidi. If he learns that it is a muzidi he tells someone who can do so to bring one. The nganga's fee for a muzidi is a chick- en, male or female; dishes of plantain and peanuts, a packet of squash seeds, pork, and a calabash of palm wine. Then the nganga makes a large funnel of banana leaves and puts in it all the food and the figurine or muzidi. Then he pours the wine into a little African bottle and puts it in the funnel, so that the nkuyu will feel moved to enter quickly when he sees all those things he likes in the funnel. The nganga whistles to call to him, and the singing and drumming begin. When the nkuyu hears songs pleasing to him and the drum- beats resounding, he comes closer, cautiously. When the nganga sees that the nkuyu has come closer, he pours out the potion around the funnel to calm all the approaches and escape routes, and tells the singers and drummer to redouble their efforts. When the nkuyu hears the crescendo of the song and the noise of the drum he comes closer, but dancingly, dodging here and there until he can see the group of people. The bystanders can- not see him, however, only the banganga and those who are in a state of possession. At last he enters the funnel himself, the nganga seizes him and transfers him into the muzidi. They do not remove the funnel until he has eaten all his food. It is necessary to inspect the food the nkuyu has eaten because in fact it may not really have been eaten, because it looks just as it did when it was put in. When it has indeed been eaten it is evi- dent that the food is just an empty shell or husk; its essence has been consumed. Nkuyu just eat its taste and goodness. We can know that they just eat the goodness of something because the banganga eat the remains after the nkuyu has finished, and when they do it is apparent that the food has no taste; it has become tasteless, insipid, not worth eating. The banganga have to eat this food so that the nkuyu does not become annoyed and fail to remain in the figurine or muzidi, thinking that they have put something of poor quality in the food, or that they gave it in anger, otherwise why would they fail to eat the provisions? How Do We Know It Worked? How do we know he has gone into the figurine or muzidi? From the food he eats and from the way he talks in the packet of leaves in which they have caught him, because when they seize the packet and open it they hear something rustling. Also they can tell by the weight of the object; when they pick it up and heft it, and find that the muzidi has become heavy, they know the nkuyu is in it. And that's not all, because they can interrogate it. They take the muzidi and bend over it, holding it in both hands, and ask it questions, like this: "Have you truly entered this muzidi as you were asked to? How are we to know that you went in for sure?" Then if he is inside they will see the muzidi move about in its owner's hands. "Sika-sika," he says, "at your service, all in place; sika-sika, all in place, at your service." african arts * spring 1995 51</page><page sequence="5">0 4 n m 0 c c z Then they ask a second question: "Eh, tell us truly whether you are not just deceiving us, leading us vainly on. Have we built an empty house? Is this a false appearance of weight? If you did not go in, tell us how come it seems to be heavy, as though our nkuyu had entered, whereas in fact nothing. This heaviness, is it yours, our brother, or did witches do it? Maybe the nganga has cheated us for the sake of his profit? Or are you having us on? Well now, are you in there?" Then they see it moving about again: Hoppity, hoppity... "Is that you in there?" "Sika-sika-sika..." When they notice this response they know that the nkuyu has really entered and is in there. Or else they see that the food has not been eaten, because when they taste it they find that it still has its flavor, then they know nkuyu has not entered. Likewise, if they heft the muzi- di and it seems to have no substance but just floats about; if they blow palm wine on it and there is no quivering in response, then they know there is no nkuyu in it, he hasn't entered. There are many reasons why the minkuyu, once entered, may leave again. Perhaps on account of anger, or because people have not observed the taboos, since when they enter mizidi or figurines they have their rules. The prohibitions include: A stranger may not put his hand in the basket or other container where the nkuyu is. When a man and wife have their minkuyu in the house they may not put their hands into such a container; the husband may not touch the wife's nkuyu, nor she his. So the reasons are that their owners have failed in their observances, or that a stranger has put his hand in where the minkuyu are; or in other instances, after the nkuyu has entered and settled down, its owner is stingy 4.

If they withhold it, the nkuyu is annoyed, becomes angry, and quits. Sometimes nkuyu is angry on account of the inheritance he left, when he sees that the heirs are quarreling and arguing over it and cannot deal with it properly. For this, too, he may become angry and quit, or because they are making miserable the little children he left behind, or his sisters or wives. When he sees that they have failed to look after what he left both inside and outside the house, he is upset and leaves. For these reasons and for any sort of dispute that breaks out in the village that he doesn't like, he may be upset and depart. There are signs by which the banganga know that the minkuyu have left, and also they know by their art, without signs. The signs are these: The nkuyu himself makes the matter known through diseases and frights, since after his departure witches come to attack his brethren. If there is witchcraft and disease and scares and livestock dying off, then they know the nkuyu is responsible, has come out. Or perhaps the packet they put in the butt of the muzidi or figurine has fallen off, or when 52 african arts * spring 1995</page><page sequence="6">they try the weight of it and find it has none, they know the nkuyu is no longer there. Sometimes when what they put out isn't eaten and his clansmen have bad luck, getting nothing when they go hunting or trading, the same. Or when they go to look at the muzidi which they left upright and find that it has tipped over or fallen down, then they know he's left. Or if his container, formerly closed, has opened, they say: "He's gone, he has opened the container." Sometimes the owner finds himself irritable and nervous, that's a sign. When they see no signs, they know that the nkuyu is still in place, hasn't come out. It is known that the minkuyu were properly put in when things improve in the village for man and beast, and there are no scares, accidents, bad luck, nasty events or quarrels. Also when they see that the food that they put out is eaten, and the muzidi seems to be in good shape, not rotting or falling apart, and the meat they have given it hasn't bred maggots. An Nkuyu Put in with His Bones When they put other minkuyu in mizidi of exceptional size, they do not go about it as they do to put them into small mizidi. For entry into large mizidi the procedure is somewhat different. This kind of putting-in is called tombula, that is, to "raise" him up as it were whole, with his body. His body is his bones. The reasons for this, the problems and the explanations, are the same as those for minkuyu which they catch to put in, just the soul without the bones of the body. The difference is this: they have a very large muzidi made, the girth and height of a person. The nkuyu they raise up is that of a man who expressed the wish for it in his life- time; when he was not yet dead he exacted a promise that he would be raised up. People who are performing tombula make a great funerary festival. They slaughter many animals and all kinds of people come to the feast. Women and men, girls and boys dance. Then the nkuyu comes to enter in where they have put his bones, from delight at the feast they have prepared for him. Minkuyu of this kind are not put in by the nganga za nkuyu. They dance the muzidi during the festival. The people who do it, two by two, are freeborn members of his clan, not slaves. These are the usages and procedures they follow in other areas in the case of bodies that are "sat with" while they are smoked for burying. An nkuyu of this kind that has been raised up and put in a large muzidi is called a kimbi. When they have completed the festival they then bury him, but this time for good. They cannot return and raise him up again. Those that are buried in this way must not be buried in graves that have been used before, but in new graves dug for the occasion. Such a grave is round and large and deep, the height of the person to be buried. When they dig it, it is not like other graves, but like this: when they have dug it properly to the right depth they hol- low it out above and bury the kimbi in it. But when they finish burying it they lay out many sticks and palm ribs and nkwala mats. Then they fill up the hole with earth to close it, treading it and packing it in. They do this so that the body should not be immediately exposed and rot in the rain. ] Notes, page 91 Top: 5. Reliquary figure (niombo/kimbi).
