<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CURE FOR WHINING Steven B. Smith: Spinoza's Book of Life: Freedom and Redemption in the Ethics. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003. Pp. xxvi, 230. $25.00) One standard by which to judge a work about politics is whether it encourages or discourages whining. There can never be too little whining in the world, but much work about politics is devoted to discovering things to whine about: about the loss of community, about the evanescence of the conditions of moral agency, about the consequences of the commercialization and commodification of everything, about the restrictions on the commercialization and commodification of everything, about the fact that in Dubai the men live longer than the women, about the fact that in Japan the women live longer than the men. One cure for whining--not effective in all cases, but whining is a very difficult disease to treat-is to read Spinoza. Spinoza is perhaps the only writer who has succeeded in writing freedom. Many books merely discuss the ways in which we are unfree and talk about possible modes of liberating us. Reading Spinoza, to the extent that you understand him, makes you free -not only free from superstition or from an obsession with sin, but free to join with others in dealing with the evils that other books only teach you to whine about. That is why reading Spinoza's Ethics, in particular, makes you happy. But Spinoza's Ethics is hard to read. Not so much because of its famous Euclidean style, with axioms, propositions, proofs, and scholia, but because we come to Spinoza having been miseducated by false philosophies. First, we read Spinoza with our notions of what it is to think directed by Descartes, who determines for us what counts as a problem for thought and what counts as a serious mode of addressing it. This is despite the fact that Descartes wrote the Discourse on Method and the Meditations on First Philosophy in order to get his readers to stop thinking and get them started doing experiments. It is not that we believe in Cartesian dualism; rather, we see what counts as physical and what counts as mental in the way that Descartes indicates, and then we attempt to one-up Cartesian dualism by explaining what he called mental in terms of what he called physical. Second, we read Spinoza with our notions of morality determined by Kant, to the point that we can be puzzled by the fact that a book called Ethics does not present a categorical moral teaching or an argument in defense of one. Worse, Kant, while himself no doubt a firm and forthright man, tried to clear a space for whining in that he attempted to show what we may hope for. Spinoza is the sovereign philosophic cure for whining because he wrote to free us from hope in powers we cannot ourselves muster and thus from the fear that our hopes are ungrounded.</page><page sequence="2">682 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS Spinoza's Book of Life is a kind of companion to the Ethics. Smith introduces the new reader of Spinoza to the fundamental themes of the Ethics: reason, freedom, imagination, and desire. He guides the reader through the celebrated controversies in the literature on Spinoza, including the controversy about Spinoza's pantheism that was to have a decisive impact on German thought from Lessing in the eighteenth century to Schmitt in the twentieth. Yet Smith is not afraid to go where other scholars would forbid us: he discusses the intellectual love of God that Spinoza claims is our highest condition, and shows its relation to the noble forms of sexual love that Spinoza can teach us to seek. Smith presents and clarifies Spinoza's argument for the imminence of all causal relations: Spinoza, Smith shows, provides a framework for explanation that rules out appeals to future purposes and spiritual forces. The Ethics thus frees us to live in the world as it is, without confusing ourselves by appeal to divine providence or to final causes. Yet, as Smith shows, the God-talk in the Ethics, or as Smith terms it, Spinoza's "counter-theology," is crucial to Spinoza's argument for imminence. Smith focuses on the rhetorical effect and political consequences of Spinoza's refutation of the biblical image of an anthropomorphic deity who wills the punishment of sinners and the reward of the righteous. It could also be noted that unlike Descartes or Newton, who imagine hypothetical theories of bodily motion that leave room for God the Creator as the cause of what actually is, Spinoza distinguishes what is from what we only imagine to be and thus argues that God the Creator exists only in our imaginations. Human choices, too, are within rather than outside the network of imminent causal relations; the transcendent will asserted by the theologians (and later to be defended by Kant) does not exist. Yet the freedom that we ought to care about, the freedom to think for ourselves and to do what we think best, is not merely preserved by determinism, Smith argues, but the freedom that we ought to cherish requires something like Spinoza's determinism. Only if our actions can be caused by our reasons is our activity more than the expression of spontaneous whims that we can neither justify nor claim as our own. Smith aims to place the Ethics within the history of philosophy and especially the history of political philosophy. This labor is necessary for new readers of the Ethics since Spinoza is excluded from American undergraduate syllabi in the history of political thought, which skip from Hobbes to Locke, and from such syllabi in the history of philosophy, which present only Descartes, Locke, and sometimes Leibniz. Smith shows how Spinoza beats Hobbes at Hobbes's own game by showing that republicanism is more effective than monarchy at channeling desire to peaceful and productive ends. Moreover, by setting Spinoza's Ethics in the context of Cartesian metaphysics and Kantian moralizing, Smith forces his readers to confront their learned prejudices explicitly and thus, perhaps, free themselves from them and allow them to read Spinoza. -Michael S.
