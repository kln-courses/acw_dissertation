<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Formation of the Transjordan-Syria Boundary, 1915-32 V.M. AMADOUNY The creation of an international boundary between Transjordan and Syria was one of the outcomes of the secret treaties that were signed by the Imperial powers during the First World War. Although Transjordan was not created until 1921, its boundary with Syria had been allocated in 1920 through a procedure designed to separate the French from the British Mandated territories. The Transjordan-Syria boundary is 233 miles long. It begins from its western extremity at a point east of El Hamme station which marks the triangulation point of the Palestine-Syria-Transjordan boundary. From this point the boundary runs for 24 miles following the course of the Yarmouk River and its tributary wadis, the Wadi Zayzun and Wadi Meddan. From the Wadi Meddan the boundary runs in a south-easterly direction for 80 miles to a point south of Imtan in the Jebel Druze and north of Tel Rumah in Transjordan. From this point the boundary runs north-easterly in a straight line for 129 miles, terminating at the triangula- tion point marking the junction of the Transjordan-Syria-Iraq boundary at Jebel Khurgi, 33°22'29" north, 38047'33" east' (see Map 1). The boundary zone between El Hamme and the Wadi Meddan is populated and fertile farming land. As the boundary zone extends south- easterly into the Jebel Druze, the density of population gives way, the land becomes semi-arid and is visited on a seasonal basis by nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes. From the Jebel Druze as far as the termination of the boundary in the east, the boundary zone runs through uninhabited desert, while the edge of Transjordan's lava belt protrudes into the eastern extremity of the boundary zone. The Hejaz Railway bisects the Transjordan-Syria boundary south of Deraa, while the branch line of the railway running from Deraa to Haifa (currently out of service) criss-crosses the Yarmouk River in several places. The Iraqi Petroleum Company's oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa (currently out of service), and the Haifa-Baghdad Road run parallel to each other approximately 20 miles south of the boundary line. The Transjordan-Syria boundary was first allocated in the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement between Britain and France, formally enacted by the Franco-British Convention of 23 December 1920.

The Transjordan-Syria boundary evolved over a period of 17 years from 1915 to 1932 and was one of the consequences of Britain's involvement in the Middle East during the First World War. During the war, Britain made agreements with the Imperial powers, notably France, and with the Hashemite Sherif of Mecca, Hussein ibn Ali. These agreements traded territory in the Middle East in return for the military engagement of Ottoman forces.2 The report of the De Bunsen Committee in 1915 into Britain's interests in 'Turkey-in-Asia' established a precedent for the partition of the Ottoman Empire. The May 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement with France to partition the Ottoman Empire's Arab lands into French and British zones of interest was first put into practical effect at the Conference of the Allied Powers at San Remo in April 1920 whereby France awarded itself the League of Nations Mandate for Syria, and Britain awarded itself the Mandate for Palestine and Iraq. In the aftermath of the French occupation of Syria in the summer of 1920, both France and Britain laid claim to portions of the Yarmouk Valley and the Jebel Druze. British military officers were posted to five towns in Transjordan in August 1920 in order to deter any French expan- sion south of the Yarmouk River, but the fact is that the boundary line was not clearly marked in the map which accompanied the Sykes-Picot agreement. The League of Nations decided on 8 December 1920 that one of the responsibilities of the Mandatory powers would be to define the boundaries of the Mandated territories. Accordingly, the Franco-British Convention of 23 December 1920 allocated the boundary separating the French from the British mandated territories.3 The boundary was a more clearly stated version of the line that had been drawn up for the Sykes-Picot agreement in 1916, even though the wording was still very general in nature, and even though the map which accompanied the agreement was not based on first-hand geographical knowledge of the area. The boundary as it affected Syria and what would become Transjordan ran from a point at Abu Kemal in the east in a straight line to Imtan in the Jebel Druze. The line then ran north-west through the Yarmouk Valley terminating on the coast of the Mediterranean. The boundary line as it ran through the Jebel Druze and the Yarmouk Valley was not explicitly traced, rather it was agreed by the parties that the Yarmouk Valley would 535</page><page sequence="4">MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES lie within French territory, yet allow on the southern bank of the River sufficient territory in the British Mandated area for the construction of a proposed railway link between the eastern Mediterranean and Baghdad.4 However, Article 5.3 of the Convention offered scope for an amendment to be made to the boundary in the Yarmouk Valley, by containing provision for the boundary to be readjusted as far as Nasib, in the event of the railway and pipeline being constructed. But if Britain was to take advantage of this option, the amendment had to be made within ten years5. In political terms, Article 5.3 proffered an amendment that would suit British interests. But the process of delimitation after 1921 was slowed up by the French, and on occasion this was deliberate and was an attempt by the French to retain as much territory for Syria as they could. Indeed, much of the history of the formation of the Transjordan-Syria boundary is concerned with diplomatic, rather than geographical issues, even though the final demarcation of the boundary did not radically amend the 1920 Convention, and offered reasonable concessions for both sides. Transjordan was established as a Hashemite Emirate under the League of Nations, in April 1921. This was the main consequence of the agreement that had been made with the Hashemites during the First World War, an agreement which was consummated at the Cairo Con- ference in March 1921 and the talks in Jerusalem with Abdullah which followed. Under these arrangements, Abdullah, the second son of Hussein ibn Ali, became the Emir of Transjordan, and his younger brother, Faisal, became King of Iraq. Britain's overall strategic objective in the Middle East was to control the land, sea and air route to India which passed from the eastern Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Persian Gulf. The creation of the Mandated territories of Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq, and compliant governments in Cairo and Tehran facilitated this objective and shaped much of security policy in succeeding years.6 After the creation of the Emirate of Transjordan in April 1921, the British and the French intended to move the process of boundary forma- tion a stage further. A boundary commission was set up in 1921 and began to survey the boundary zone in the Yarmouk Valley before a conflict of interests suspended the process. The problem, which was to resurface in later years, concerned the vague wording of the 1920 Convention, and rival British and French claims to territory in the Yarmouk Valley and the Jebel Druze.7 Following the suspension of the boundary commission, further delays set in. The Transjordan government experienced some difficulty in exerting its authority over the countryside, and this situation did not significantly improve until 1924, when the Colonial Office took more direct control over Transjordan's internal affairs. Not long after 536</page><page sequence="5">THE TRANSJORDAN-SYRIA BOUNDARY, 1915-32 this reform began to take effect, the outbreak of the Druze rebellion in Syria in 1925 delayed the process of boundary formation for another two years. During the Druze rebellion, the British allowed the French military to move south of the 1920 Convention Line in pursuit of Druze guerrillas. In 1926 the RAF - Britain's military service in Transjordan - asked the Colonial Office for clarification of the limits of the RAF's territorial responsibilities in Transjordan; Accordingly, the British and the French Mandate administrations organized an informal boundary commission which agreed a Frontiere de Fait to last for the duration of hostilities. Through the Frontiere de Fait the boundary line between Transjordan and Syria was moved further south than the 1920 Convention Line, though in practical terms only the Jebel Druze and the eastern marches of the Yarmouk Valley were affected by this arrangement. For their part, the British first monitored the activities of Druze refugees encamped at Azraq and Umari in Transjordan, and then, in the summer of 1927, expelled them from the country." In spite of the co-operation between British and French forces in the period between 1925 and 1927, both parties regarded the other with suspicion as far as their long-term interests in the region were concerned. French fears of the British were aroused at the end of the Druze rebellion, when in December 1927 it was discovered that the Commander-in-Chief of the Arab Legion, Lt-Col F.G. Peake and the Officer Commanding the RAF (Transjordan), Group-Captain L. Rees, had paid a visit to the Christian village of Tissie in the Jebel Druze without French permission. The two officers had visitied Tissie as part of a general reconnaissance of the Jebel Druze. They discovered that the French had used their freedom of movement south of the 1920 Convention Line to create a Druze presence in the villages of Semme and Umm Jemal in Transjordan.9 The French High Commission in Damascus, M. Henri Ponsot, lodged a formal complaint with his British counterpart in Jerusalem, Arthur Plumer. In his reply, Plumer apologized for the breach of protocol and explained that the British officers had been sent to the area to 'prepare certain proposals for an exact definition of a provisional boundary'.'° The attempt by the French to establish a permanent presence in the Transjordan villages of the Jebel Druze was a pre-emptive measure in advance of any formal negotiations on the Transjordan-Syria boundary. It was also enacted to give the French a bargaining advantage in the negotiations over the Syria-Iraq boundary that were taking place at the time. These manoeuvres were transparent to the British. In particular, in early 1928 violence attended a bungled attempt by the French military to collect taxes from the Transjordan-based Bani Sakhr tribe, at their 537</page><page sequence="6">MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES encampment south-east of Umm Jemal. On further investigation in Umm Jemal, and the nearby village of Semme, Druze farmers confirmed that they had been removed from their villages in Lebanon, and told by the French authorities to claim settlement rights in the two villages dating back to Ottoman times." Opinion in the Colonial and Foreign Offices on this course of events was divided. Lord Monteagle, Counsellor in the Foreign Office, advised caution on the boundary question. He took the view that the French were more concerned with the negotiations over the Syria-Iraq boundary and would be unwilling to move on the Transjordan-Syria boundary at this stage.'2 However, both the Colonial Office and the Air Ministry wanted more urgent action to be taken. Apart from the armed clashes that had taken place in the Jebel Druze, there was a fear that if the French consolidated their position along the Frontiere de Fait, this could threaten the security of the proposed routes that were to be taken across Trans- jordan by the oil pipeline and the railway running from Iraq to Haifa. In addition, they wanted to move to a delimitation of the boundary before 1930, in part because this would enable them to amend the boundary in the Yarmouk Valley in Transjordan's favour, and in order to provide Iraq with delimited boundaries in advance of its application for membership of the League of Nations. The Colonial Office were also opposed to the prospect that territory in Transjordan would be bargained for concessions along the Syria-Iraq boundary, particularly in the Jebel Sinjar, a portion of which the French claimed for Syria.13 The fears of the Colonial Office were not subdued. It was also the view at the Quai d'Orsay that their former foreign minister (Bethelot) had been too quick to cede Mosul to the British in 1919, an error they did not intend to repeat in the Jebel Sinjar. To the British this meant that out of their co-operation with the French during the Druze Rebellion they had lost, if only temporarily, territory that the 1920 Convention had placed in Transjordan. With the British mindful of the security tensions in the Jebel Druze and keen to move ahead with the termination of Iraq's Mandate, there was also a keen desire to roll back the French from the Jebel Druze.'4 Notwithstanding this desire to establish the Transjordan-Syria boundary, there was no consensus of opinion in either the Colonial or Foreign Offices as to where, precisely, the boundary line should run, nor of the best means of processing such an agreement with the French. Though the 1920 Convention was taken as the foundation of the discus- sion, its vague wording left some areas open to question. But no such problems existed in Transjordan, where there were clear ideas about where the boundary should run. These views were held, after all, by 538</page><page sequence="7">THE TRANSJORDAN-SYRIA BOUNDARY, 1915-32 people - Transjordanians and Mandate officials - who knew the disputed territory well. The Emir Abdullah was mostly concerned that Transjordan retain the village lands where there had been time-honoured rights to grazing and cultivation. These views were supported by the British Resident, Lt-Col. Cox, who offered a definition of the boundary with Syria with concessipns on both sides. In Cox's view, the two Arab villages in the Jebel Druze were to be returned to Transjordan, while other portions of the Jebel Druze could be taken by Syria. In the Yarmouk Valley, Cox argued that the whole area from El Hamme station to the Hejaz railway should lie within Transjordan, as implied in Article 5.3 of the 1920 Convention, but that territory in the vicinity of Nasib on the railway could be ceded to Syria. In practical terms, Cox argued, these recommendations could be implemented without substantially altering the 1920 Convention.'5 In spite of Cox's recommendations, which were to form the basis of the 1931 agreement, the Colonial Office deferred to the Foreign Office view of the boundary question. This took the Transjordan-Syria and the Syria-Iraq boundary questions as one aspect of the Anglo-French rivalry in the region which had simmered ever since the British had established two Hashemite monarchies in Iraq and Transjordan in 1921. On top of the tendency to subsume the specifics of the boundary question under the 'broader view' of Anglo-French rivalry, the procedural problems involved in reaching an agreement with the French also caused delays. From this procedural point of view, it appears that both parties put pressure on the other. The French, aware that the British wanted to terminate Iraq's Mandate, hoped to prevaricate over the Syria-Iraq boundary sufficiently for Britain to agree a concession in the Jebel Sinjar just to complete Iraq's transition to independence. The British, for their part, were determined to resist this pressure, and used the tactic of suggesting that the whole matter be passed over to the League for their independent adjudicaton, knowing that the French preferred a bilateral deal.6 The procedural problems in the boundary question became clear at a series of informal talks that the British held with the French in Paris in July 1930. The French were quite intransigent with regard to their claims over Umm Jemal and Semme, but indicated a willingness to bargain these villages with British concessions in the Jebel Sinjar. They also indicated their preference for a bilateral deal in advance of any referral to the League. In view of the impasse which appeared to be hardening around their respective positions, the British and the French in Paris agreed on a formula whereby each party woud draw up its detailed interpretation of the 1920 Convention Line, to form the basis of future negotiations."7 539</page><page sequence="8">MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES After the Paris talks, Colonial officials in London and Amman drew up their proposals for the Transjordan-Syria boundary in expectation of a fresh round of negotiations; the French team went off on their annual vacances. To the British, this suggested that the French had agreed to the Paris talks merely to assess the British position. It also meant more delays, and that no proposals would be ready in time for the meeting of the League Council in September that year, while presentation to the Council meeting in January 1931 was also in doubt. This was another delay in the attempt to terminate Iraq's Mandate, and prevent an amendment of the 1920 Convention in the Yarmouk Valley.'8 Procedural obstacles con- tinued to hold up progress in the aftermath of the Paris talks. Though the Foreign Office was keen to refer the matter to the League, Cadogan, in Paris, doubted the merit of this approach. He argued that the League would be reluctant to agree the revision of a treaty, as this would set a precedent that would encourage other member states to attempt to re-open boundary disputes.'9 No advance was made on the boundary question until the spring of 1931. The impasse was breached when Ponsot held informal talks in Beirut with the Iraqi High Commissioner, Sir Francis Humphrys. The two officials established a personal rapport with each other, and agreed a provision formula for negotiations which envisaged the separation of the two boundary questions, and for the Transjordan-Syria boundary to be resolved first. Both sides also agreed that they would negotiate a bilateral amendment to the 1920 Convention, and present it to the League as the penultimate stage in the boundary-making process envisaged in Article 2 of the Convention, rather than a major revision of it.2" Thus it appeared that the way was open for the two parties to enter into final negotiations on the disputed boundary zone. The formal negotiations on the Transjordan-Syria boundary opened in Paris on 7 October 1931. There were two outstanding problems to be resolved: finding the appropriate procedure to resolve the amendment to the 1920 Convention; and agreement on the specific location of the boundary line. In the first round of talks, no significant advance was made. Both parties retreated behind their well-aired positions with regard to terri- torial concessions. The French were adamant that they would not with- draw their claims to the villages of the Jebel Druze south of the 1920 Convention Line, the British insisted that they must do so. The French, exploiting the leading presence of the High Commissioner for Iraq,2' once again tried to persuade the British to negotiate the Transjordan-Syria 540</page><page sequence="9">541 THE TRANSJORDAN-SYRIA BOUNDARY, 1915-32 boundary together with the Syria-Iraq boundary. The British replied that this was not necessary. It then emerged that the two parties had changed their positions with regard to procedure. After the Beirut meeting in the spring, the British took the view that delimitation could go ahead in the form of a bilateral agreement. They were, then, exasperated to discover that the French were now taking the view that the matter should be referred to the League! The argument was that if France was to cede territory to the British, it would have to be seen as a response to a recommendation from the League, for there was no other way that the Foreign Minister could steer the required legislation through the Assemblee Nationale. At this point, Humphrys issued the French with an ultimatum, that they either negotiate on the basis of the Beirut formula, or the British team would pack up and go. The French were reluctant to see the talks collapse, and offered a conciliatory response to Humphrys. Thus, by the end of the first week of negotiations both sides had made concessions and were moving toward a final delimitation of the boundary. The first concession was made over the village of Awad in the Jebel Druze. The British laid out their map of the boundary zone and agreed with the French that Awad should lie in Syria, but that land to the south of the village should lie in Transjordan. There was also agreement on land east of the Yarmouk Valley. Here, the villages of Amrawa, Shejera, Turrah and Remtha were to lie within Transjordan, and the villages of Tel Shehab, Mezerib and Deraa, in Syria. The villagers of Turrah, never- theless, were to have access to a pool lying in the Wadi Meddan on the Syrian side of the boundary.22 At this stage of the negotiations, there were two areas over which agreement had not been reached. In the west of the Yarmouk Valley, the French continued to argue that the 1920 Convention could not be amended, because the 10-year period the British had to construct a railway had lapsed, thereby leaving the Yarmouk Valley in Syria. To circumvent this problem, the British proposed that the middle course, or 'thalweg', of the Yarmouk River be taken as the boundary line, but that where the Deraa-Haifa branch line crossed into Transjordan the railway line would be deemed to be sovereign Syrian territory. At this stage the French offered only their tentative approval of the scheme. Elsewhere, the Jebel Druze continued to present problems. The French held out for a boundary line two miles north of the Frontiere de Fait, with cultivated lands being retained by Syria. This was unacceptable to the British as the routes that were to be taken by the proposed oil pipeline and railway would be too close to the boundary line in this area. The British wanted either a withdrawal by the French to the 1920 Convention Line, or</page><page sequence="10">MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES a treaty of Bon Voisinage to establish a boundary line without interfering too greatly with human movements in the area. More progress was made in the second week of negotiations, when the French relaxed their insistence that the delimitation be referred to the League for consideration and agreed to a bilateral arrangement. Ponsot admitted that the French team were being 'advised' by Berthelot, whose approach to the boundary question was proving to be inflexible.23 From the end of the second week to the end of October the two teams were consulting with their governments on final proposals for the delimitation. The Colonial Office view was that security interests in the Jebel Druze narrowed Britain's range of options, that territory ought not to be con- ceded and that, at best, where there was an impasse a Bon Voisinage agreement should be reached. In the Yarmouk Valley, Humphrys was told to try and negotiate the 'thalweg' as the boundary but authorized to withdraw as far as the southern bank of the River if this was the only agreement the French would accept.24 In the event, the prior proposal that had been made was acceptable to the French. This allowed for the 'thalweg' of the Yarmouk River to mark the boundary between Transjordan and Syria, except for those parts of Transjordan where the Deraa-Haifa railway crossed over the river, areas which would be considered to be part of Syria. This was a generous interpretation of the 1920 Convention by the French as it guaranteed territory for Transjordan which could have been claimed for Syria. The impasse in the Jebel Druze was finally resolved through a Bon Voisinage agreement. In effect, the 1920 Convention Line was restored, with the exception of Awad, which was now in Syria. A two- mile corridor between the villages would mark the boundary, within which dual claims of access to land for grazing or cultivation would be regulated by the Bon Voisinage agreement, though taxes on agricultural produce would be paid to Syria. Lastly, both sides agreed to a 'self- denying ordinance', whereby they agreed not to set up new villages or settlements in the two-mile corridor.25 The two teams considered these arrangements to be satisfactory as they did not constitute a major amendment to the 1920 Convention but met the requirements of Article 2. Moreover, in those areas where the wording of the Convention left room for doubt, there were reasonable concessions on both sides. Transjordan secured the sovereignty over the Yarmouk Valley and ceded land to Syria east of Remtha. But in both cases there had been little real dispute on the ground, or where there was a potential difficulty, as with Turrah, this was resolved with a local arrangement. In the Jebel Druze, minor amendments facilitated an agreement, though in subsequent years it transpired that Syria had 542</page><page sequence="11">THE TRANSJORDAN-SYRIA BOUNDARY, 1915-32 benefited more than Transjordan from the Bon Voisinage agreement. The Protocol between Britain and France which delimited the Transjordan- Syria boundary and the Bon Voisinage agreement for the Jebel Druze was signed in Paris on 31 October 1931. There followed an exchange of letters between the British Ambassador in Paris, Lord Tyrrell, and the French Foreign Minister, M. Aristide Briand, in which the delimitation of the boundary was confirmed.26 The Protocol was approved by the Council of the League of Nations at its meeting in January 1932.27 Following the League confirmation of the Protocol, a joint Anglo- French Boundary Demarcation Commission was formed. It had been intended to begin the demarcation in March, but unavoidable delays meant that the Commission could not begin its work until the torrid summer months of 1932.28 The demarcation survey covered the whole of the boundary zone from El Hamme station to the triangulation point of the Transjordan- Syria-Iraq boundary. The process involved the erection of cement cairns at stragetic points along the boundary line. Areas of disagreement were settled on the spot, but although Kirkbride29 tended to make light of these incidents, the War Office geographer was concerned that discrepancies in the British and the French maps would cause problems at a later date." The international boundary between Transjordan and Syria was created in accordance with the stipulations of the League of Nations, and followed the conventional three-stage process of boundary formation. The first stage, the allocation of the boundary, took place through the Franco- British Convention of December 1920; the second, delimitation stage was reached with the Franco-British Protocol of October 1931, and the final stage of formal demarcation took place in the summer of 1932. The Transjordan-Syria boundary can be described as a 'boundary of separation', common to sparsely populated areas. It is to be distinguished from a 'boundary of contact' common to heavily populated areas.3' The distinction is made on the basis that while peoples on either side of the boundary zone lived in reasonable proximity to each other, for example in the Jebel Druze, this was not a heavily-populated area in terms of population density. A more elaborate typology for the Transjordan-Syria boundary can be found in Drysdale and Blake, after Boggs.32 Here, the Transjordan- Syria boundary can be considered a 'complex boundary', as it incorporates elements of three features of the border landscape. Thus the boundary has physiographic features, such as the use of the 'thalweg' of the Yarmouk 543</page><page sequence="12">MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES River and the Wadi Meddan. A set of anthropomorphic features shapes the boundary in the Jebel Druze with its two-mile corridor and Bon Voisinage agreement. Lastly, the boundary has a geometric feature for that section of it which leaves the Jebel Druze and passes through desert to the boundary junction with Iraq and Syria.33 However, Drysdale and Blake have also pointed out that 'there is no such thing as a natural boundary; all boundaries are arbitrary'.'- This aspect is of some importance for Transjordan, where boundary formation contributed to the political development of the modern state, even as it affected the economic and social life of the nomadic bedouin who had freely migrated in the boundary zone for generations. In general terms, the formation of the Transjordan-Syria boundary was part of the much broader creation of a separate state system which Britain and France imposed upon the Middle East following the First World War. In the particular case of Transjordan, boundary formation provided the British with the circumscribed space within which an infra- structure of power could be developed. Such an infrastructure began to take shape from 1921 onwards, with Amman as the political centre of the Hashemite Emirate. From this location, an effective government, supported by military and judicial powers, created a new system of law and order, and a more effective tax-collecting process than had been known under Ottoman rule. In economic and social terms, the Transjordan-Syria boundary became an additional element to other factors which curtailed the mobility of the nomadic tribes. To some extent, the late Ottoman period had already made some impact upon nomadic life. The greater effectiveness of the Ottoman military in northern Transjordan in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries established a long-term challenge to the authority of the tribes in Transjordan. Economically, the revitalization of agricul- ture coupled with land reform was a further challenge to Bedouin practices, while the construction of the Hejaz Railway, as well as being an efficient arm of the military, eroded the economy of the camel-trade along traditional trading routes. The era of the Mandate saw a further erosion of the pastoral economy of the Bedouin. For the 1920s and most of the 1930s, the steep decline in the price of camels on the Cairo market hit the tribes hard and was coupled with a marked increase in the use of motor vehicles throughout the Mandate period. In addition, raids into Transjordan from the Wadi Sirhan depleted herds, while the protracted drought which afflicted Transjordan between 1924 and 1936 caused severe hardship. The larger tribal confederations, such as the Rwala and the Bani Sakhr, were able, in the long term, to adapt to these changing conditions. For smaller tribes, such as the Sirhan, the Transjordan-Syria 544</page><page sequence="13">THE TRANSJORDAN-SYRIA BOUNDARY, 1915-32 boundary was an additional blow, as tribes crossing the boundary were forced to pay Syrian taxes, though this was not accepted in the 1931 Protocol (see Appendix, below). Thus traditional trading practices were eroded, with the tribes reorienting their movements ever closer to the cultivated zones of Transjordan. This contraction of mobility also facili- tated the sedentarization and encapsulation of the tribes, forging new ties of loyalty to the Hashemite dynasty in Amman in the guise of military service.35 From yet another perspective it is the case that while the formation of the Transjordan-Syria boundary was one element which changed the behaviour of some of the tribes, the boundary as such held no meaning for them. As a contemporaneous view (1925) expressed it, with regard to the Turkey-Persia boundary question of 1913-14, nomadic conceptions of boundaries and sovereignty were shaped by human rather than western European notions of private property.6 Finally, it is to be observed that it was not until the formal demarcation of the boundary in 1932 that it was possible for the War Office to compile an accurate map of the boundary zone. Up until this point, maps had been drawn without first-hand knowledge of the area, raising the prospect of difficulties in the event of any discrepancies between maps and reality, as a War Office geographer pointed out in 1930: There is no fully reliable map of this part of the world available, and although it may be said that you now have in a convenient form the latest material, yet you cannot rely upon it to any very great extent. If, therefore, you use these maps for the purpose of drawing imaginary lines which you hope to find on the ground in relation to the detail shown on the map, then I am afraid you will be asking for trouble. These maps in fact can only be used for the purposes of generalised discussion and will in no way serve to dispense with the services of a properly organised and constituted boundary commission.37 Thus, the Transjordan-Syria boundary not only conformed to the requirements of the League of Nations, to the conventions of boundary- making, and the political aspirations of Britain and France in the Middle East. It also contributed in a small way to the modernization of the carto- graphical knowledge of a part of the Middle East. 545</page><page sequence="14">MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES NOTES I am grateful to Alan Bum of the Cartographic Unit, Southampton University, for producing the map. 1.

Appendix: The Transjordan-Syria Boundary Annex A Protocol relative to the Settlement of the Frontier between Syria and the Jebel Druze on the one side and Transjordan on the other side. I. Definition of the Frontier 1. Yarmuk Sector (a) From the point where the railway crosses the Yarmuk above El Hamme as far as the point where the railway crosses the river above El M'Khebi, the frontier follows the thalweg of the Yarmuk, it being understood that the section of the railway situated between these two bridges, and lying to the east of the Yarmuk, shall be accorded, in favour of Syria, the same exterritorial regime as was provided for, in the case of the railway already delimited as far as the station of Semakh, by the Delimitation Agree- ment of the 3rd February, 1922 (which fixes the last point delimited). (b) From the above-mentioned point above El M'Khebi up to the point where the railway crosses the Wadi Meidan in the direction of Mezerib for the last time, the frontier runs on the TransJordan side of the railway at a distance fixed, where these rivers flow on the south side of the railway, by the thalweg of the Yarmuk and of its tributaries, the Wadi Zeizun and the Wadi Meidan, and where the railway runs on the TransJordan side to the south of these rivers, by the railway itself. In the latter case the frontier shall be established to the south of the railway and parallel to it in such a way as to leave to Syria, besides the railway iself, its structures and grounds, its borrow-pits, its stations, its yards and outbuildings, and the area necessary both for the technical protection of the railway and its works and for its operation. This definition of the railway also applies to the section of the railway mentioned in the paragraph (a) above. (c) Nothing in the preceding definition of the frontier shall have the effect of modifying the water regime relative to the Yarmuk and its tributaries, as provided for in article 8 of the France-British Convention of the 23rd December, 1920. 547</page><page sequence="16">MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES 2. Deraa-Remthe Sector From the point defined above, where the railway crosses the Wadi Meidan, as far as the point where the frontier meets the railway to the south of Nasib, the frontier is defined by the following marks and cairns:- From the bridge on the Wadi Meidan, the frontier rejoins the line which separates the lands of the TransJordan villages of Amrawa, Shejera, Turrah and Remthe, on the one hand, from the lands of the Syrian villages of Tel Shehab, Mezerib, and Deraa on the other. This line passes through el Bueib on the road from Deraa to Remthe, and thence follows the western crest of the Jebel-ez-Zumla as far as the cairn situated on the southern extremity of the line separating the lands of Deraa from those of Remthe. From the latter cairn the frontier runs to the cairn situated approximately 1,500 metres to the south of the farm of Rahaya; thence, it passes to the cairn of Kabr Hamdan, and continues towards the cairn situated at Kerkur Sud, and thence rejoins the railway at a point situated between the Syrian village of Nasib and the TransJordan village of Jabir, in such a way as to leave to each of these villages the lands which belong to them. It is understood that when the frontier, in this second sector, follows a watercourse or Wadi, the thalweg is meant, and when the frontier follows a crest, the water parting is meant. It shall be understood that whatever the actual line of the frontier, inhabitants of Turrah shall continue to have access as heretofore to the water points in the Wadi Meidan situated to the east of Jisr Meidan. 3. Sector to the East of Nasib and Jabir From the point above mentioned, between Nasib and Jabir, to the point where it meets with the frontier between TransJordan and Iraq, in the neighbourhood of Jebel Tenf, the frontier is defined as follows:- (a) From the above-defined point on the railway, the frontier rejoins the point of inter- section of the meridian of Semma with the line defined hereafter. Between the meridian of Semma and the meridian of Tell Rumah it passes to the north of a line running through the following points:- Semma, Umm-es-Surab, Shajara (a place approximately 2 kilometres south-west of the solitary tree on the track from the Umm-el-Jumal to Tissiey), Subhiya, Sabha. Umm-el-Kuttein Deir-el-Kahf (or Deir-el-Kaht) and Tell Rumah, these points being situated in TransJordan. The frontier shall be indicated by boundary marks placed 3,200 metres (say, 2 miles) to the north of and parallel to the lines which join the centres of the places or localities mentioned above. It is understood that if the village of Khirbet Awad or any part of that village is found to lie to the south of the frontier line as marked out above, the frontier shall be deflected around and to a point situated 60 metres to the south of the last group of houses at present existing, rejoining the main line to the east and to the west of the village by lines forming an angle of approximately 90 degrees at the point above mentioned (60 metres to the south of the village), in such a manner as to include in the territory of the Jebel Druze all the inhabited part of this village as well as the land situated within this salient form the main line. (b) From the point 3,200 metres north and on the meridian of the highest point of Tell Rumah to the frontier of Iraq in the neighbourhood of Jebel Tenf, the frontier shall run in a straight line in the direction of Abu Kemal on the Euphrates, the geographical position of this village being calculated, for the special purpose of establishing this line, by reckoning the central point of the locality. 548</page><page sequence="17">THE TRANSJORDAN-SYRIA BOUNDARY, 1915-32 Sub-Annex to Annex A General Lines of the Agreement on the Frontier Relations and 'Bon Voisinage' A separate agreement will be concluded as soon as possible, to regulate relations on the frontier between Syria and the Jebel Druze on the one side, and TransJordan on the other side, in such a way as to allow non-nomadic, semi-nomadic and nomadic inhabitants having properties or rights of pasture, watering or cultivation across the frontier, to continue to enjoy their rights. Such inhabitants shall be able, within the limits of a frontier zone on either side of the frontier of width to be defined hereafter, to convey from one side of the frontier to the other their beasts, the natural increase, and produce of their flocks, agricultural implements intended for their work, their vehicles, their seeds, and the agricultural produce of their properties, without having to pay any dues in respect of customs, pasturing or watering, or any other tax leviable in respect of entry into the neighbouring territory. The agreement contemplated will furthermore contain provisions designed to ensure the maintenance of complete order and security in the regions bordering on the frontier. In particular the measures to be taken against persons coming from one territory and commit- ting acts of aggression in the other will be laid down, and provision will be made for the exclusion from a zone on each side of the frontier, of a width to be fixed by agreement between the two Governments, of any individuals whose conduct might be considered as prejudicial to peace and order in the territories under the administration of the other party.
