<plain_text><page sequence="1">t1U0CiR WIWmEm According to a recent report by the National Office for Envi- ronment Protection and Nature Conservation, some 4200 km24.5 percent of the country's territory-come under the 'sprotected" categories promulgated by the 1971 Act on Na- ture Conservation. These include 3 national parks, managed in compliance with international standards; 102 nature re- serves limited to scientific observations and "gene per- petuating" projects; and 27 protected landscapes, an all- purpose term which means that the character of a given region should be preserved with regard to architecture and/or flora and fauna thereby permitting only limited development projects. The same report projects a marginal 0.8 percent increase of protected areas by 1990, the reason being the shrinkage of unspoilt land left for nature conservation in the future. Although no exact figures are available as to how many species have become extinct over time in Hungary, it is clear that the natural habitat of the majority of species were left undisturbed until the second half of the 19th Century with the exception of species doomed by hunting such as the aurochs (Bos primigenius) which disappeared in the 13th Century, the moose (Alces alces) and the European bison (Bison bonasus) both of which were not seen after the 18th Century, the beaver (Castorfiber) the last wild specimen of which was shot in 1859, and some avian species. The greatest change in the fauna of Hungary was brought about by the extensive river regulation projects of the 19th Century which affected 37 000 square kilometers of swamps, marshes and reedy stretches and caused the disappearance of at least ten avian species. PROTECTED FAUNA Nevertheless Hungary has just under 30 000 species of ani- mals, indicating a rich fauna. At present 415 species are protected by law and are divided into two groups according to the degree of danger they face. Table 1. Protected animals in Hungary as of 1980.

The elegant Great White Egret (Egretta alba) has not fared much better than many other birds of prey, though it used to nest in Hungary in vast numbers in the 18th Century. The bird symbolized the nation so much that its plume even became part of the national gala costume. By 1916, however, its population was reduced to 25 pairs, and in 1950 there were only two pairs left in a nature reserve. Luck- ily, their present number of 215 pairs indicates a steady re- covery, thanks to a higher number of marshy nature reserves in the country. One of the tools of the Office to ensure the survival of endangered species is constant surveillance of nests for poachers. The work is shared by the 3000-strong Hungarian Ornithological Society whose members volunteer to stand guard over nests that lay outside protected areas. TOXIC CHEMICALS Pesticides, contaminants, and the mechanization of agriculture are among the major threats many species face today. The mole-rat (Spalax leucodon) is in grave danger of extinction largely due to deep ploughing by tractors, and the birch mouse (Sicista subtilis trizona) faces immediate extinc- tion unless the poisoning of farmland rodents is stopped. The cumulative effect of pesticides on fish caused two major fish disasters in Lake Balaton (see Ambio No 4, 1978, p 164). Another warning was given by the tragic case of 2000 wild geese that were killed in a nature reserve in Eastern Hungary in the autumn of 1974 due to the misuse of fungicide- treated wheat seeds. Some species that are treasured rarities in other European countries, such as, for example, the wild boar, are regarded expendable in Hungary and are still hunted. Unfortunately the same Act that extends protection to certain species makes a provision lifting the ban on hunting over areas where inten- sive breeding of wild species is practiced, for example pheas- ants (Phasianus colchinus) and partridges (Perdix perdix). Ultimately, it seems that the best way to ensure the survi- val of a rich and varied fauna in Hungary would be the obliteration of the deep-rooted anthropomorphic notion of "useful" and "harmful" animals which has persisted far too long. In order to restore ecological equilibrium to natural systems, man must cease playing one animal off against another. Elika LFszlo Correspondent Budapest Table 1 shows a relatively high proportion of birds among the endangered species. This is largely due to the gradual shift from extensive farming to intesive agricultural practices and deforestation. As a result, their natural habitats have been decimated, and the altered ecological balance works against their chances of long-term survival. Therefore, several pre- datory birds have been placed under protection, including the White-tailed Eagle (Haliaetus albicilla) of which there are no more than 5 to 6 pairs left and the Imperial Eagle (Aquila heliaca) of which there are 8 to 10 nesting pairs in Hungary. The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) has most recently disappeared. The rare saker (Falco cherrug) is one of the much-treasured species of predatory birds because after its disappearance from Western and Northern Europe, Hungary is the northernmost part of the continent where it still nests (Figure 1). 207 AMBIO, 1980 35 t3 esa Protecting Hungary's Wildlife - -- r --w- fp,,,@= -- ^ 1 ,- ^ &gt;' _'2 #) _. r ^} /&gt;o w W( J - * 0 r , Figure 1.
