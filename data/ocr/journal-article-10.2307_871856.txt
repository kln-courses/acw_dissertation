Mr Digby's book is a first courageous attempt (in England) to apply the methods of depth psychology (more specifically, the individual psychology associated with the name of Jung) to the interpretation of contemporary art. The author is not a professional psychologist, and he is not writing for psychologists: they would probably find his choice of psychological method too arbitrary and his terminology not scientific enough. The general reader, on the other hand, will be relieved to find an intelligent discussion of the problems of contemporary art which is free from bar- barous jargon. It is possible, however, that in his attempt to simplify his treatment of a difficult subject Mr Digby has simplified the problem itself. He is convinced, as anyone without prejudice must be, that the modern artists he has chosen as representative are com- pletely sincere, and that the 'difficulty' they present to the public is something that can be resolved by intelligent criti- cism. What they have in common is a certain symbolic discourse, and the key to an understanding of this discourse may be found in the science that is particularly concerned with symbolic activities, namely psychology. Art, Mr Digby affirms, 'is largely and fundamentally concerned with the manifestations of the unconscious mind, and particularly with the non-personal un- conscious'. If only we can have an under- standing of the part played in life by the images that rise from this mental level, we shall have a key to the understanding of art 'in so far as art is an awakener and revea- ler of life both for the individual and for his social and cultural group'. The method is one of amplification: that is to say 'what at first appears as a purely personal fantasy, idea, or image in the imagination, may some- times turn out to bean archetypal expression which is common to humanity at widely separated times and places, and which has a specific meaning lying as a seed or germ within its manifold terms of reference... The image or idea can be amplified by ana- logies taken from similar human experiences which are already somewhat more closely determined; from dreams, fantasies and hallucinations recorded from work in the consulting room; from the imaginative expressions of art and literature; from religious experiences and visions; and from the great storehouse of myths'. The trouble with this method is its lack of precision. In Munch, Moore, and Nash we are concerned with three artists whose images or symbols come from very differ- ent levels of the psyche. 'The subject of Woman played a very important part in Munch's art ... Women fascinate him, yet they hold for him dread and terror ... Woman is a vampire, sex is a mockery which leaves the soul unsatisfied, man is always lured by woman to his undoing .. .' - we are not very surprised to learn that the root of all this is Munch's relationship to his mother, 'that deep and primary relationship of early childhood on which basis has to grow and develop the whole future man'. If you feel like that about Woman, you paint depressing problem pictures, and there is something too obvious in recording the fact and then assuming that we have a deeper under- standing of Munch as an artist. But in the case of Henry Moore the situation is not the same - the symbols are not drawn from phenomenal experience, they cannot be 'read' in the terms of everyday life, and the 'problem' they present to the critic is therefore of quite a different nature. We must dig very deep into the unconscious if we are to get anywhere near their source, and it probably needs a trained analyst to do the job (it has, in fact, been done by such an analyst, Dr Erich Neumann, in an essay on Henry Moore which is to be published shortly). Meanwhile Mr Digby's amplifications are full of interest, but descriptive rather than interpretative. We are told, for example, that 'Henry Moore's sculpture expresses a strongly atavistic attitude', and particular works are related to 'the dismemberment theme' or the 're- birth theme'. Various myths and rites are then mentioned (the Dionysus myth, the Osiris myth, the rite of 'Ch6d') and a correspondence or parallelism is then effected between the sculptures and myths. This does add to the interest of the sculp- tures, but it hardly explains their 'meaning'. What we really need is, not merely an ident- ification of the work of art withits archetype and associated myths, but analysis of the transformations which the archetype under- goes in the development of the artist, and in particular an appreciation of the formative influence (ifany) which the archetype hason the work of art itself- i.e. is the psychic force that moulds the nascent images inherently aesthetic? Is there an archetype of form as well as of image? Any psycho-analyst's file of case-histories is full of perfect archetypal images, but none of them is likely to be a work of art. In the case of Paul Nash we again have a distinct type of imagery. It is not merely that his symbols, unlike those of Munch and Moore, are not anthropomorphic ('they are expressed in terms of inanimate images and relationships, especially the relationship of sky, earth and sea, the sun and moon, vegetation and the seasons'); they again come from a different level of the psyche - not so superficial as Munch's symbols, not so deep as Moore's. Nash was a child, or grand-child, of the pre-Raph- aelite movement, as his letters to Gordon Bottomley make clear. He later became associated with the Surrealist movement, but there was nothing inconsistent in that! To make a conscious use of symbolism is no longer to function in a valid symbolic manner; but that is the danger in a painter who wants to be more than a realist. Writing as late as I925 Nash said: 'I am less &amp; less concerned with picture-making &amp; more &amp; more interested by this elusive something which a painter pursues in painting, an engraver in engraving, a draughtsman in drawing or for that matter any artist in any art ... I have still a certain amount of literary stuff in my aesthetic system! But once one had begun to find the plastic values all other consider- ations seem irrelevant'. To this Bottomley replied that 'though a picture may be built without any "literary" references, I believe that inevitable "literary" refer- ences will one day be evolved from it if it is a vital picture ...' The truth seems to lie within both these statements - namely, that vital images are discovered in a work of art, but are not put there deliberately. It is the psychology of that accident that still awaits elucidation. Apart from the incidental light which it throws on problems like these, the letters exchanged by Gordon Bottomley and Paul Nash over a period of thirty-six years may be read as a record of a great friend- ship and as a revelation of the inner workings of the minds of two sensitive artists. Such oracles of wisdom cannot be replaced by any amount of'amplification'. H. R.</page></plain_text>
