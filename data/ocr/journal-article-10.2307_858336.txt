<plain_text><page sequence="1">INDIAN BRONZES 0 BY ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY -k T is only within recent years that Indian bronzes and copper statuettes have begun to be studied and appreciated. In Calcutta, a fine series of Nepalese and Tibetan examples were obtained by Mr. Havell for the School of Art collection. Good specimens of South Indian bronzes may be seen in the Madras Museum. The Colombo Museum has recently been enriched by a series of magnifi- cent examples excavated by Mr. Bell at Anurad- hapura and Polonnaruva.' Large series of Maha- yana Buddhist bronzes from Java are in the museums at Batavia and Leiden, and in the British Museum, and there are important examples ISee P.

Many of the finest bronzes are practically inaccessible in the temples of Southern India, and there must be many others yet to be excavated in ancient sites. The great majority of modern images are almost worthless from an artistic point of view. The finer bronzes, roughly speaking, fall into three groups : the Mahayana Buddhist bronzes of Java and Ceylon (sixth to twelfth century or fourteenth century A.D.) ; the Mahiy-~na Buddhist bronzes of Nepal and Tibet (Medieval, say ninth to seventeenth century) ; and the Hindu bronzes of Southern India and Ceylon (also Mediaeval . A small bronze (P1. I, 6), representing the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara," in the writer's col- lection, from Ceylon, dating from the seventh century or thereabout, exemplifies the purest ideal of Indian art in its finest period. The tiny figure shows the Bodhisattva-the mystic Christ of the Eastern world, teacher of gods and men, who will not pass into N irvdna ' till the last particle of dust has gone before him'-in the traditional attitude of one who teaches or expounds. Set in the headdress is a seated figure representing One of whom the Bodhisattva is but a part or phase-- the Dhyiini Buddha Amitabha. The traditional conceptions of the external marks of physical and spiritual beauty-broad shoulders, slender waist. limbs with anatomical detail suppressed, the face expressing perfect peace-are nobly realized. The easy attitude, and the assured carriage of the head, alike mark the conception of a teacher who speaks from the fulness of love and knowledge. The type of beauty is not that of youth itself, but of one who is for ever young. The artist's power is shown in the elimination of detail, the further determination of which would reduce the concep- tion from the abstract and synthetic to the concrete and particular. We may contrast with this a realistic figure (P1. I, 2) of about the same date, also from Ceylon, and in the writer's collection, representing Jambhala (Kuvera), a god worshipped for wealth and material prosperity, an Oriental 'Goods,' made in the very image of the well-fed merchant who worshipped him for luck. The technical achievement in this little figure is very remark- able; it seems, as you hold it in the band, as if you felt the very texture of the flesh, firm and healthy, although so fat. Probably a little later in date, is a beautiful stand- ing figure (P1. I, 3), from Anuradhapura, now in the Colombo Museum, representing, I think, the Bod- hisattva Maitreya,5 in the attitude of a teacher. This figure belongs to a type called, at least by modern Sinhalese craftsmen, tri-vanka, 'thrice. bent,' the head, trunk and lower limbs having a different inclination. The pose of such figures reminds us of the 'sway' characteristic of so many Mediaeval European ivory Madonnas. The weight of the body is thrown on the right leg, the left hip being raised-an attitude that becomes a man- nerism in much later work. The treatment of the drapery is full of grace. The expression of the face is serene and exalted, but the figure as a whole is stiffer and less finely modelled than the Avaloki- tesvara. Of about the ninth century is a Dharmap.la6 (PI. II, 9) from Java, from the museum at Batavia. Such figures represent dread avenging emanations of the rapt and peaceful Bodhisattvas-avenging, not in an individual sense, as an angry god, but as Nature punishes those who work against, not with, her. From a Hindu standpoint, such an image would be considered as representing Bhairava,7 an attendant or form of Siva; it is, as it were, a vision of Nature,' red in tooth and claw,' not cruel, but ever-creating and destroying. To Western eyes, such figures are at first repellant; yet none can fail to be impressed by the unity and sense of power and movement and reality given to this seemingly uncouth, yet truly beautiful, four-faced, eight-handed god. ' Perhaps to uninitiated eyes these many-headed, many-handed gods at first may seem,' writes Lafcadio Hearn, speaking of Mah.aydna Buddhist images in Japan, ' as they seem always in the sight of Christian bigotry, only monstrous. But when the knowledge of their meaning comes to one who feels the divine in all religions, then they will be found to make appeal to the higher estheticism, to the sense of moral beauty, with a force never to be divined by minds knowing nothing of the Orient and its thought . . as they multiply before re- search, they vary and change: less multiform, less complex, less elusive the moving of waters, than the visions of this Oriental faith . . . the stranger, peering into its deeps, finds himself, as in the tale of Undine, contemplating a flood in whose every surge rises and vanishes a face-weird or beautiful or terrible-a most ancient shoreless sea of forms incomprehensibly interchanging and intermingling, but symbolizing the protean magic of that infinite Unknown that shapes and reshapes for ever all cosmic being.' Were further explanation or justification needed for artists who knew so well how to say just what they desired to say, in work so informed with 2See Journal Roy.

For those whose preoccupations are intensely human-who would rather, like the Greeks, shape the gods in the image of their own athletes than perceive them as personifications of the Powers of Life and Death-all that makes the gods in-human must be 'disagreeable.' But this is after all the most obvious anthropomorphism; and art is not limited to 'facts' for its means of expression. Hinduism, like the religion of Orpheus, 'is the worship of the real mysteries of life, of potencies rather than personal gods; it is the worship of life itself in its supreme mysteries of ecstasy and love.'s There are those for whom the gods are 'things not of reason, but both above and below it, causes of emotion which we cannot express, which we tend to worship . .. not fabulous im- mortal men, but 'Things which Are,' things utterly non-human and non-moral which bring man bliss or tear his life to shreds without a break in their own serenity.'" These find no great enough up- rush of life embodied in Olympian deities like those of Greece, howsoever lovely; they ask from the greatest art a suggestion at least of a life beyond our reasonable imagination, of Being apart from time and space. This longing leads at last to the abstract symbolism of pure idealism; but in the stage of worship, and where, as in older India or ancient Egypt, the religious and artistic sense are closely linked, it leads to mystic art. The Greek genius did not give expression to the higher side of Orphic mysticism in the terms of plastic art. Who knows, had it been otherwise, what wonder might through our eyes have drawn our hearts to inward things; but Greek art was outward-turned, 'had in it no touch of mysticism,' and for all its supreme attainment must be called in a real sense materialistic. But if, as the Mystic says, ' Man has no body distinct from his soul, for that called body is a portion of soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of the soul in this age,' then we ought to be as careful to avoid condemnation in using the word materialistic as to avoid indifference towards the mystic art. Though we may, according to our own nature, rejoice more in one and less in the other, yet if we are not prejudiced, we shall realize that neither is necessarily greater than the other, and that neither can be wholly judged by the standards of the other. Both natures and both arts are neces- sary in the scheme of things, being complementary and different. Conceding this, we shall refrain from criticizing the Indian imager for not accom- plishing things which he rarely tried or wished to accomplish. We shall rather yield him praise for so far succeeding in expressing things which few Western minds have ever tried to state in terms of vision. Returning now to the actual bronzes, we come to the group of mediaeval Hindu (Saivite) figures from Southern India and Ceylon. These have hitherto been best known by the magnificent and characteristic example of a Nataraja (dancing Siva) in the Madras Museum. Because this figure has been often reproduced, I give here a rather less fine example (P1. II, 7) from Polonnaruva, in Ceylon, now in the Colombo Museum. In respect of the perfect form of the enclosing fiery ellipse, the Ceylon example is superior to the Madras, but the limbs are not so slender and the pose less wonderfully balanced. The details of the concrete symbolism are better shown, however, and it is worth while to briefly explain their significance. The whole figure symbolises the activity of the Lord in the Universe, His Five Acts-Creation, Preservation, Destruction, Embodiment, and Re- lease. 'Our Lord', says a Tamil text,' is the Dancer Who, like the heat latent in firewood, diffuses His power in mind and matter and makes them dance in their turn,'-a poet's intuitive perception of an idea of the nature of matter not far removed from the conceptions of modern science. Of concrete symbols, the drum in one right hand signifies creative sound, the vibratory movement initiating evolution ; the flame in one left hand symbolises the converse activity, destruction, involution. The hand upraised says to the worshipper 'Fear not'; and the other points to His foot, the refuge of the soul. The right foot tramples on a demon representing the cosmic illusion of empirical reality. The Ganges, in the form of a mermaid, and the Crescent Moon are set in His streaming hair. One cobra wreathes itself about His arm, another is twisted in His locks. Upon His brow blazes the third eye of spiritual wisdom. Such are the details of a type of which many examples occur; and when, as sometimes happens, the individual inter- pretation is fully worthy of the original conception (perhaps not quite the case here), we have a wonder indeed. With this figure we may contrast another type, very peaceful and noble in expression, the Siva as Gangldhara (P1. II, 8), from a Tanjore temple. Gangidhara signifies,' He who bears the River,' for it is said that when the Ganges fell from heaven, Siva caught its waters in His matted locks, lest their force should overwhelm the world, and there they wandered lost for ages before they reached the earth at last. In this story we may see perhaps (though there may well be more in it than this) a vision of the mighty river's source amongst the forest-covered slopes of the Him-alayas, where, on the mythic Kailis, is situated Siva's paradise. 8 J.

I, I), from Polonnaruva, represents the boy-saint, Sundara Miirti Swimi (fl. ca. 700 A.D.). This figure is certainly one of the great masterpieces of Indian sculpture. The story goes that the boy on his bridal day was claimed as a family slave by an old man who stopped the marriage procession and produced a written bond, a copy of an original, the validity of which had at last to be acknowledged by the reluctant spectators; it was agreed that the boy must follow the old man to his home. None knew where this was. He led the way into a Sivan temple and there disappeared, only to re- veal himself as Siva in glory with Pdrvati and Nandi. Then only did the boy bridegroom realise Whose were the bonds that bound him. The figure represents this moment of illumination--a passion of love and adoration. The two bronzes last described, with the Nata- raja of the Madras Museum, are probably the finest examples of the tenth and eleventh century school of Southern Saivite sculpture, which owes its inspiration to the development of devotional Saivism in the time immediately preceding. This school is apparently quite independent of the al- most contemporary Buddhist schools, of which examples (of about the ninth century) are well known from Java and Ceylon. Buddhism had died out in Southern India by the beginning of the eighth century. A large gilt bronze figure (P1. I, 5) of Pattini D~vi, from Ceylon, now in the British Museum, I group provisionally with the Medieval Hindu bronzes. The seriousness of expression and beautiful modelling of the upper part of the bust are very noteworthy, and the thin clinging drapery; but the slenderness of waist is carried to a somewhat extreme point. This deliberate exaggeration, like similar phrases in Indian literature, seems to modern eyes to mar the beauty of the figure regarded as a whole. Yet it is rather curious to reflect that we in modern times, who pinch our waists and feet in fact, do not accept exaggerated slenderness as an ideal; while in India constric- tion never was a fact, though very generally an ideal. One result of this at least is that modern artists who rely on models do often depict actual deformity; while the Indian idealist was free to create a type which seemed to him beautiful. It may be that we too should see it so, were it pos- sible to dissociate the ideal from the modern fact of milliners' deformities! Space forbids a long account of Medieval Nepalese bronzes. In Nepal the old traditions of the Indian imager have survived longest, and there have been less loss and destruction of ancient images than elsewhere. The ordinary types are better known than those hitherto described; beside those figured by Grfinwedel and other German writers, a series of fine examples from the Calcutta School of Art collection is given by Mr. Havell in his book on Indian Painting and Sculpture. I am now able to illustrate some fine specimens from the same collection acquired during the last two or. three years. A figure recently obtained, but not illustrated here, is a characteristic and fine Kurukulla (equivalent to the Hindu Kali), remarkable for its muscularity of pose; great tension is shown, not by the representation of the actual muscles (ana- tomical detail is as usual suppressed), but by intensity of gesture. The bronze (or copper) shown in figure io, P1. II, representing the same feminine divinity, is, so far as the face is concerned, a wonderful expression of active ecstasy; and the ugliness of the body serves only to set off this idea, being transcended in a raptyre which transfigures. Another figure (P1. II, ii) with outstretched arms represents a more internal rapture; the face con- veys an irresistible conviction of experience within. The figure is not easy to identify, but (Professor Griinwedel suggests to me) may possibly represent Sparsa (touch), one of the Five Senses (Tib. Dod-yon-inga). Another example (P1. II, 12), a four-handed seated figure, infinitely tender in its suggestion of embracing love, cannot at present be identified. There may be observed in it, as also in figures 7 and 8, P1. II, that difference of earrings on the two sides, which indicates the double nature, male and female, of the Divine Life-a conception equally characteristic of Hinduism and of Mahi- ydna Buddhism. One other example (P1. I, 4), from the collection of the Hon. Justice Woodroffe, represents Tdri (the Sakti or 'Power' of Avalokitesvara), who becomes in China the goddess of mercy, Kwannon. The beauty is of a more sensuous, less spiritual, type than is usual in Indian religious sculpture, but the sense of gracious dignity remains. The reader will now be in a position to appreciate some of the main characteristics of Indian bronzes and of Indian sculpture generally. Two features stand out most prominently, one the fine sense of nervous pose, the other the persistent idealism. The Indian standard of aesthetic criticism might well be expressed in the words of Leonardo da Vinci-that execution is best which best ex- presses the passion that animates the figure. One or more of the nine abstract passions-rasas'-- may form the burden, mood or motif of a work of art. These nine rasas are, briefly, Love, Heroism, Pity, Wonder, Humour, Fear, Disgust, Fury, Peace. The dominant rasa in a given work is usually evident, though there may be many combinations. Thus figure 9, P1. II, expresses essentially the idea of Fury, yet there is shinti (peace) in the haunting smile of a face that is partly stern, partly tender. The figure of the boy-saint (P1. I, I) expresses Ix Rasa, lit. ' flavour.' 93</page><page sequence="7">Indian Bronzes essentially that form of Love which is called bhakti, devotion, Speaking more generally of pose, we might say that it is the sculptor's aim by the representation of nervous gesture (ranging from furious movement to absolute repose) to express the intentions of the soul; and it is by his success or failure in this endeavour, and not by standards of scientific 'accuracy,' that his art, or any art, must be judged. The second characteristic of Indian sculpture is its persistent idealism. This bias towards the permanent and synthetic stands in close relation to the character of Indian religious thought, bent upon discovering the eternal amidst the transitory, the real amidst the illusory. Thus the highest aim of art becomes the presentation of a divine ideal, the visible conception of more than human, personal, indivi- dual Being, in Whom all passions are not killed, but harmonized, and all lesser types of conscious- ness resumed. Hence it is that individual character- istics are not insisted on. 11 Anatomical detail for example, is suppressed, as in fig ure6, P1. I, in favour of a more synthetic, abstract form : for the repre- sentation of being regarded as a synthesis of lesser consciousness, must be a synthesis of form. How far these ideas were conscious or sub-conscious in the artist's mind we cannot always tell ; but it is certain that in a land of passionately spiritual faith like India, we cannot understand the religious art without some sympathy with the deepest in- tuitions of the faith that itself has moulded and inspired the art. We must remember also that in India philosophy and faith are both constituent elements of religion, not separated or opposed as more often happens in Western religious thought. This, however, is not the place to analyze at length the philosophical background of Indian art and religion. It will suffice if the illustration of some of the masterpieces of Indian bronze founding serve to call attention to the great artistic and technical achievement of those who modelled and cast them, and to the spiritual beauty of their imagination. 12Portraiture, indeed, is categorically condemned by Sukra- charya. Compare the story concerning Pheidias, who was flung into prison (rightly, the old Indian artist would have said) because he introduced the image of a ruling statesman into a bas-relief taken from sacred Greek history. The portrait Madonna of the later Renaissance is equally ' irreligious.'</page></plain_text>
