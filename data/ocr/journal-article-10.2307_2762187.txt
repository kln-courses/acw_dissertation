<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY. When a philosopher has once laid hold of a favorite principle, which perhaps accounts for many natural effects, he extends the same principle over the whole crea- tion, and reduces to it every phenomenon, though by the most violent and absurd reasoning.- HUME, "The Sceptic," Works, Vol. III (I826), p. 18o. To GIVE anything approaching an adequate account of con- temporary sociology would be a difficult task. Just at present we are in that initial stage of the science in which a great army of really honest and earnest workers is wholly without organiza- tion-an army, it might be called, all the members of which are officers having the same rank, and none subject to the orders of any other. Each one is pursuing the one particular line that he has chosen. Nearly everyone has some one single thought which he believes to embrace, when seen as he sees it, the whole field of sociology, and he is elaborating that idea to the utmost. Now, it is clear that he will make much more of that idea than anyone else could make. He will get all the truth out of it that it contains. It is true that he will carry it too far and weight it down with implications that it will not bear, but these are, like the errors of all scientific inlvestigators, subject to uni- versal criticism and ultimate rejection by putting the real truth in their place. The notion has always been prevalent that men of one idea are useless, or worse than useless. The fact is that they are the most useful of all men. I do not refer to such as are afflicted with the pathologic id&amp;e fixe, but to those who are, as it were, possessed and consumed by some single thought, some favorite hypothesis, some heuristic conception, which grows larger and more all-comprehensive, until it impels them to pursue it untiringly to its last logical conclusion and to work into it great fields of truth that no name that can be given it would even suggest to anyone else. Work done under such an inspira- tion is thoroughly done. The analysis is exhaustive, and it never fails, notwithstanding the necessary error and exaggeration, to 475</page><page sequence="2">476 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY constitute a substantial contribution to the general stock of human knowledge and to the true progress of science. All sciences pass through a long analytic period before reach- ing the synthetic stage. Sociology is still in its analytic period. There is even a disposition to condemn all attempts at synthesis. No one will recognize anything done by others. There is a spirit of intense individualism. There is no disposition to appropriate the truth that is being produced. The ideas that are put forth seem to have no affinity for one another. On the contrary, they are mutually repellent. There is little real con- troversy, because everyone regards all other ideas as quite unworthy of attention. There is, therefore, no discussion, and the necessary prelude to co-ordination is discussion. When dif- ferent writers shall begin to discuss one another's ideas, there will be some hope of an ultimate basis being found for agree- ment, however narrow that basis may be. In this perfectly independent way a large number of what may be called systems of sociology are being built up, most of which are regarded by their authors as complete and as super- seding all other systems. Any attempt to present all these sys- tems to the reader would require a volume. This has, however, already been done in great part, and ably, by Professor Paul Barth' in the introduction to a work whose title indicates that he has himself a system, but who differs from most of his con- temporaries in not only respecting, but in understanding, other systems. The most that I can do here is rapidly to enumerate the principal systems or general conceptions of sociology. Properly I should confine the enumeration to scientific con- ceptions, but some of the most widespread and popular of these conceptions lie outside the pale of science. They belong to the pre-scientific period. They are to sociology what astrology is to astronomy, alchemy to chemistry, and horuspicy to physi- ology. Such is the greater part, for example, of the so-called Christian sociology, and with this is to be classed all that well-meant treatment of social Droblems which looks onlv to I Die Philosophie der Geschichte als Sociologie.

A distinction is also to be made between an -ism and an -ology. I do not, for example, question the legitimacy of socialism as a subject for study and a field of labor, but it relates to action and implies a purpose, which excludes it at least from any pure science. Its relations to applied sociology need not be discussed here. In the following enumeration of the principal systems of sociology I shall endeavor to find some single word or expres- sion for each of the leading ideas, conceptions, doctrines, sub- jects, or groups of social facts characterizing them, which must sometimes be taken in a somewhat broader sense than the one that is current for the term, but with such explanations as I shall make I do not think that any confusion or misunderstanding is likely to arise. I. SOCIOLOGY AS PHILANTHROPY. It is probably safe to say that this conception of sociology is the prevailing one with the public today. The word now fre- quently occurs in the newspapers, but always in this sense. More than nine-tenths of the papers that are read before the American Social Science Association proceed from that idea of social science. It is the housing of the poor, charity work gen- erally, slumming, reform work in the neglected quarters of cities, settlement worlc, etc. Sometimes it gets beyond the tenement house and sweating system and deals with consumers' leagues and co-operative stores. It includes such municipal reforms as public baths and lavatories, and the placing of public parks, gar- dens, and art galleries within the reach of the less well-to-do classes. This cannot be called a system of sociology, and it has no one leading advocate or exponent, but it is the common notion of what sociology or social science is, and is all the idea that the general public, the newspaper reporter or editor, or the average member of Parliament or of Congress has of it. Of course, it is not science at all, and therefore it cannot be</page><page sequence="4">478 TILE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY sociology at all. No one will, however, be so illogical as to con- strue this into condemning it. It is social work, often of a high order, and for the most part very useful, but it is not sociology. Nor need it be denied that there are aspects of philanthropy that may and should be made scientific. Such are all attempts to grasp those principles of human nature which lead to methods of dealing with the poor and the unfortunate that will perma- nently elevate them and not make parasitic degenerates of them nor bring about the survival of the unfit. Such was most of the work of Professor Amos G. Warner. We may therefore heartily indorse the words of another professional philanthropist when he says: I plead, therefore, here as everywhere wherever chance gives me oppor- tunity, for a more intimate association and fellowship between professional sociologists and professional philanthropists. I deplore the sociological teaching which is fragmentary, disjointed, a mere mosaic of quotations from the reports of actual observers of human life in its various aspects, arranged without regard to proportion or perspective, and which produces the effect upon the mind of a Chinese painting resembling nothing in heaven or earth.' II. SOCIOLOGY AS ANTHROPOLOGY. Among scientific men by far the most common conception of sociology is one that is essentially anthropological. The moment the subject of human society is presented, it brings up the wider conception of man as the being whose association con- stitutes it, and with the natural scientific habit of looking for the origin and development of things, attention is at once turned to primitive, uncivilized, barbaric, and savage man, and this field proves so large and so attractive that it holds the attention. It cannot be denied that anthropology, as the science of man, has as one of its departments the laws and forms of human associa- tion, and from this point of view sociology is a branch of anthro- pology. But there is another point of view which treats sociology as an abstract science and not as a branch of zoblogy, and thus viewed it stands as one of the great co-ordinate independ- ent sciences alongside of biology, chemistry, and physics. Most I FREDERICK HOWARD WINES, in the Annals of the Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. XII, P. 57, JUlY, I898.</page><page sequence="5">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 479 sociologists look at it from this point of view; but even then many consider it necessary to dwell mainly on the forms of asso- ciation of primitive peoples. This has the advantage of making it certain that the foundations of sociology will be laid broad and deep. There is one special school that call their science anthropo- sociology, which seeks primarily a classification of the western European races based on physical and mental characteristics. The facts collected by this school are highly interesting and important, but they draw from them a train of conclusions which are one-sided and largely false. So far as the application of the facts is concerned, it is characterized by what may be called teutonolatry, which is the more remarkable as the school is headed by a Frenchman. The point of view is very narrow, scarcely going beyond what the present state of things seems to teach, and quite ignoring even early human history. It would be unfortunate for them if it should ever be shown that Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were dark-haired and dark-eyed brachy- brunes, as seems very probable. Alexander the Great and Julius Casar may not have been blond beasts at all, although they were the kind of beasts that are worshiped by Ammon and Nietzsche. And has it ever been proved that Napoleon Bonaparte, the Cor- sican, was not of the species Homo mediterraneus rather than H. europces? Certain it is that the theory formulated from the facts of anthroposociology utterly fails to account for all the early civilizations that rose around the Mediterranean and in the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates. III. SOCIOLOGY AS BIOLOGY. If, among scientific sociologists, the anthropological school is the most widespread, the biological school is certainly just now the most earnest, vigorous, and aggressive. It takes the definite form of looking upon human society as an organism in strict analogy with an animal or vegetable organism. We are nowhere told to which of the three great " kingdoms of nature," mineral, vegetable, animal, this organism belongs. It can scarcely be mineral or vegetable, but is it animal ? Or does it</page><page sequence="6">480 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY form a kingdom apart, not yet recognized by the books? Another question that troubles the specialists in biology is whether this organism is to be regarded as a species, a genus, a family, or some higher classificatory group. If a species, to what genus does it belong ? If a genus, to what family, etc.? There are as many questions of this kind as there are classifica- tory groups, until we reach the primary subdivision of nature into kingdoms, and we have seen that even here the same ques- tion still confronts us, and, so far as I am aware, no one has attempted to answer any of these questions. Notwithstanding these dimiculties that confront the biological specialist (and I know of no "organicist" who is such), the analogy possesses such a charm that it fascinates a large number of able and vigorous investigators, and they have pursued it, one would suppose, to its utmost limits. The passion for analogies has been at once one of the most powerful stimuli to research and one of the greatest sources of error in the history of science. It arises from the great strength which the faculty of causality acquired in the human mind at a very early period in its devel- opment. This faculty is the basis of all the early world-views of the race, and underlies all anthropomorphic conceptions. It is its action that is referred to when we hear it said that religion and science start from the same point and have essentially the same object, viz., to explain the universe. But we must care- fully distinguish between causality and ability to perceive causal connections. The idea of natural causation and the faculty by which it is cognized are of comparatively recent date and are developed only in relatively few minds. The old philosophers called this faculty the ratio sufficiens, and the German metaphy- sicians translate this into their Satz vomn zureichenden Grunde, or simply Satz vom Grunde. Causality is rather the sense of a need for some explanation in terms of a cause, and the question of its sufficiency or adequacy is usually left quite out of view. Every- thing combines to show that the world has always been just as well satisfied with an inadequate as with an adequate explana- tion. If it only gives some explanation, the mind is at rest. The wildest magic completely satisfied, not only the Orient, but</page><page sequence="7">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 48I the unscientific part of the Occident, and, as a matter of fact, the great majority of those who inhabit the most enlightened coun- tries have a very imperfect idea of the relations between causes and effects. The serious alarm of the Pai-Ute Indians in I875, at my suggestion to throw a cap-box full of ground cedar berries into Fish Lake, in Utah, lest it might poison the whole lake and kill them all, is closely paralleled by the fright that seizes the average civilized woman at the sight of the outside of a bottle marked Poison! over the cross bones. Now, the love of analogy is based on the innate craving for an explanation of phenomena, unaccompanied for the most part, as in the case of magic and anthropomorphic ideas, by any strong demand that the explanation be adequate and the cause a sufficient one. This it is which vitiates so much of the reasoning of ethnographers relative to similar conditions found in widely separated regions, as in the Old and New Worlds, and leads to false theories of derivation of customs by one people from another. The Pythagoreans, who studied musical tones in stringed and wind instruments, and who also studied the heavenly bodies, saw an analogy between them, and taught the "music of the spheres." This music, they said, would be perceptible to the human ear if it were not perpetual and constantly heard from infancy through life, while we can be conscious only of sounds in which there is an interchange between sound and silence.I Not to be confounded with this, but equally mythical and mystical, is Schopenhauer's fanciful analogy between musical tones and the various " objectivations of the will," according to which the bass notes represent the earth and planets and inor- ganic matter generally, while the higher ascending tones typify the dawn and progress of life, feeling, and thought.2 Sacred numbers are familiar to all, being found connected with nearly all great religious and philosophic systems. The number seven is by far the most common, and many attempts to explain it have been made. The last, and perhaps the best, derives it from the I ARISTOTLE, De Coelo, II, 9, 4. 2Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung (Leipzig, i859), Vol. I, PP. 304 ff.</page><page sequence="8">482 THE AMER/CAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY widespread heptalogy of savages relating to direction and posi- tion, viz., the north, the south, the east, the west, the zenith, the nadir, and the here. There are always " seven wonders of the world," and even Du Bois-Raymond was so far influenced by the myth that he wrote of the "Seven World-Riddles," when he might have made them either more or less. The number five, so universal in all systems of counting and calculation, due, of course, to the number of digits in man, has entered less into philosophy, but the "pentalogies" of Major Powell,, constitute an interesting psychologic study from our present point of view, all the more on account of his specific claim (p. I I2) that all of his pentalogic properties are correlated with the decimal system and the number of digits.2 The general idea of a social organism is very old. Aristotle expressed it quite clearly, not only in his much-quoted t65iov ,ro\XrTrcV, but in passages in which he declares that society is a giant having hands, feet, sense, and intelligence. St. Paul is supposed to have virtually embodied it in Romans, chap. 12, and I Corinthians, chap. 12. Marcus Aurelius said some- thing very similar, and other cases might be cited earlier than Hobbes, who made the state an artificial man of vast power, and emphasized the organic conception in the name Leviathan of his principal work. But no scientific or properly biologic treatment of the subject was made prior to the nineteenth century. Comte in I838 seems to be the first to mention a social organism. He said: One may form a philosophic idea, just in all respects, of the true essen- tial nature of these real variations by comparing them especially with analo- gous variations in the animal organism, which are exactly like them, as subject to similar conditions, whether static or dynamic, with this sole rational difference that social modifications may become more extensive and varied than simple biologic modifications ... . The essential principle, established especially by the labors of the illustrious Broussais, destined henceforth to characterize the philosophic spirit of positive pathology, is, by its nature, as applicable to the social organism as to the individual organism.3 x Truth and Error; or, The Science of Intellection (Chicago, I898), passim. 2 Cf.

We speak of "the body politic," of the functions of its parts, of its growth, and of its diseases, as though it were a creature. But we usually employ these expres- sions as metaphors, little suspecting how close is the analogy, and how far it will bear carrying out. So completely, however, is a society organized on the same system as an individual being, that we may perceive something more than analogy between them. He then proceeds to give certain examples, and adds: Hence we are warranted in considering the body as a commonwealth of monads, each of which has independent powers of life, growth, and reproduc- tion; each of which unites with a number of others to perform some function needful for supporting itself and all the rest; and each of which absorbs its share of nutriment from the blood. And when thus regarded, the analogy between an individual being and a human society, in which each man, while helping to subserve some public want, absorbs a portion of the circulating stock of commodities brought to his door, is palpable enough.' The exhaustive treatment which Mr. Spencer subsequently gave the subject is well known,2 yet, after Professor Huxley had so clearly shown in his " Administrative Nihilism "3 that the doctrine necessarily leads to the most extreme form of social- ism, he qualified it to such an extent that he is scarcely claimed by the organicists as a member of that school. Bluntschli4 is usually cited as one of the pioneers, though it is mainly the state with which he is dealing; but the works of Lilienfeld5 and Schaeffle6 are the fundamental contributions upon which the doctrine rests.

It is remarkable how far it is possible to carry such a theory when a large number of acute minds are fixed upon it for a con- siderable time. In the following enumeration of some of the leading specific analogies that have been pointed out I make no apology for their lack of harmony, but simply give them as I find them. I omit the fanciful analogies of Hobbes and other early writers, and limit the enumeration to such as have been more or less seriously proposed by modern sociologists. The social unit or cell is the individual. (Spencer, Lilienfeld, etc.) The social unit or cell is the reproductive couple, man and woman. (Worms.) The social unit or cell is the trio, man, woman, and child. The social unit is the family. (Comte, Schaeffle.) The social unit is the clan. The family is a social molecule. Individuals are social atoms. (Ludwig Stein, Ratzenhofer.) [The last two analogies go back to physics. It is somewhat surprising that no one seems to have thought of comparing men to sperm cells and women to germ cells. The married or propagating couple would then corre- spond to the fertilized ovum or blastosphere.] The gens represents a segment of segmented animals (Anne/ida?). (Durk- heim.) The lower (mechanical) societies represent the segmented type of ani- mals; higher types take on the structure of the arthropods. (Durkheim.) Social tissues are settlements, roads, buildings, etc. (locative); facilities of exchange, commerce, trade, production (commercial); civil and military appliances and technique (administrative). (De Greef.) Social tissues consist of the simpler voluntary organizations of society. (Lilienfeld.) ,,AUGUSTE COMTE, Politique positive, Vol. I, p. 44I. (Comte does not defend the doctrine, he only characterizes it.) 2" Now Wilhelm von Humboldt's view that language is an 'organism' has been considered a great step in philological speculation; and so far as it has led stu- dents to turn their minds to the search after general laws, no doubt it has been so. But it has also caused an increase of vague thinking and talking, and thereby no small darkening of counsel."- EDWARD B. TYLOR, Primitive Culture, Vol. I (Lon- don), i87I, P. 2I4.</page><page sequence="11">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 485 The social ectoderm or mucous layer is the governing class; the social endoderm or serous layer is the governed mass (proletariat); the social meso- derm or vascular layer is the bourgeoisie. (Spencer.) The relations of contract constitute the tissues and structures of society. (De Greef.) Contract is equivalent to the distribution of the nutritive matter in the body, which is a kind of physiological contract. (Durkheim.) The aristocracy and the clergy constitute the social adipose! (Giard.) The more complex social organizations are organs of society, e. g., an academy of arts is an organ that may be likened to an eye. (Lilienfeld.) The economic operations of society (production, distribution, exchange, consumption) constitute its nutritive processes (mastication, deglutition, diges- tion, assimilation). (Worms.) The circulating mass of commodities in society constitutes its blood. (Spencer.) Merchandise in transit is unassimilated nutriment (chyme, chyle ?). (Lilienfeld.) Money is the homologue of the blood corpuscles. (Spencer. Compari- son also made by Liebig.) Roads, railroads, water ways, etc., constitute the blood-vessels of society. (Spencer.) The telegraph, the postal system, roads, railroads, water ways, banks, money, etc., constitute together the circulatory system of society. (De Greef.) The bourse is the social heart. (Worms.) The substance or matter of society consists of territory and population, of which the first is its bony framework and the second its muscular and fleshy portion. (De Greef.) The whole material environment of man constitutes "intercellular sub- stance." (Lilienfeld.) Profit is the excess of nutrition over waste in the animal body. (Spencer.) Corporations are social glands. (Spencer.) Colonization is social reproduction. (Worms.) Population is the male part and the material environment the female part of the social superorganism. (De Greef.) [Putting this with the analogy given above by the same author for these same elements, it follows that flesh is male and bone is female!] Conquering races are male, conquered races female; the struggle of races corresponds to the struggle of the spermatozoa around the ovum. The latter is passive, submits, and fertilization (the so-called cross-fertilizatioii of cultures) takes place. (Lilienfeld.) Celibates are the polar bodies rejected in the process of karyokinesis. (Dissard.) Persons who go from one society to another are analogous to leucocytes and spermatozoa. (Lilienfeld.)</page><page sequence="12">486 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY The state is the central organ (brain ?) of society. (Lilienfeld.) Government is the homologue of the brain. (This view is held with qualifications by the majority of organicists.) The nervous system corresponds to the political power variously expressed. This qualification of the last-mentioned analogy admits the comparison of all grades of societies with all stages of animal development. Fully worked out by Spencer. Subordinate governments, as of provinces, departments (in France), states (of the United States), counties, municipalities, etc., represent the hierarchy of ganglia of the developed nervous system. (Spencer, who calls special attention to the refresentaztive character of both.) Society itself represents a brain (organ) rather than an organism, and the individual brains of men constitute its cells. (Tarde, Logique sociale, p. I27.) The brain of the social organism consists of the elite of mankind. (Novicow, who totally rejects the doctrine that government is the homologue of the brain.) The sympathetic nervous system of society is that which controls the material and physical phenomena (production, consumption, reproduction), while the cerebro-spinal system regulates the more spiritual phenomena, such as beliefs, customs, arts, etc. (De Greef.) Voluntary contract represents the sympathetic system, while the state corresponds to the cerebro-spinal system of society. (Durkheim.) Trades unions and guilds are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system of society. (Durkheim.) Telegraph wires correspond to nerve fibers. (Spencer.) [Lilienfeld denies that organicists have defended this analogy, and in his system they belong to the intercellular substance, but a passage on p. I02 of his Pathologie sociale has been construed to harmonize with the Spencerian doc- trine.] Government is the homologue of the soul or consciousness, the formal unity or ego. (Bernes.) Government represents the conscious will. (Spencer, Tarde.) History is social memory. (Garofalo.) Military societies represent the Carnivora or predatory animals generally; industrial societies represent the Ungulata and other herbivorous and frugiv- orous animals. (Fouillee.) It is, of course, obvious to anyone who has followed the literature of this subject that the above list by no means exhausts the stock of specific analogies that have been pointed out between society and an organism. It may be regarded as embracing a few samples that are fairly representative of the whole.</page><page sequence="13">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 487 The term analogy is constantly used for these parallels, but no one, not even Spencer, has pretended that it is taken in the biological sense. Analogous organs in biology are those that perform a likefunction, but are constructed on an entirely dif- ferent plan. For example, the eyes of mollusks and of verte- brates, though serving the same purpose, are altogether different structures; the wings of insects, of bats, and of birds, all enable their possessors to fly, but all three are distinct organs anatomi- cally; the proboscis of a hawk-moth greatly resembles the long beak of some humming birds, and both are used to penetrate tubular flowers, but, of course, they have no structural resem- blance; the horseshoe crab chews with its legs, and the various sexual calls of insects (crickets, cicadas, grasshoppers, etc.), corresponding in purpose to the notes of birds, are made by various parts of the body, but not in the mouth or throat; the termites or white ants (Neuroptera) have neutral workers like true ants (Hymenoptera), but they are not functionless females, and seem to have been produced by like social necessities. The structures and functions of society that are compared with those of organisms stand in no such relation as this. There is no principle or plan of construction which admits of comparison. The functions performed or purpose subserved is somewhat similar, and this is all that can be said. It only proves that in all departments of nature there is a cosmic law that works similar results. Still less do these "analogies" possess the character of biological homologies. These are cases in which the same struc- ture produces a different organ, the reverse of analogies. For example, the fin rays of fishes are the same structures as the fingers and toes of men, and the digits generally of the higher vertebrates, and the latter are the homologues of the former. But not only is there a transition form among living and fossil animals, viz., the Dipneusta, in which the number of digits is much greater than in the Amphibians, where it became fixed at five, but there is a corresponding embryonic stage in the onto- geny of all the higher vertebrates, including man, at which the phylogenetic record of a many-toed ancestry is preserved. The</page><page sequence="14">488 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY process of reduction of digits was resumed with the Ungulata, becoming two in cloven-footed animals (cattle, sheep, hogs, etc.), and finally only one in the Solidungula (Equidae), or horse family, the toeless feet of which are still the homologues of fins. This entire series of transitions has now been thoroughly worked out in the paleontological history of this group, from the five-toed Eohippus of the Eocene to the true horses of the existing fauna. Again, all the appendages of the skin of animals, for whatever purpose used, are homologous, as scales of fishes, plates and scutes of reptiles, feathers of birds, hair of mammals, and even the teeth. Transitions are seen in the hair of the cassowary and the quills of the porcupine. The social " analogies" are nothing of this sort, and the biological specialist, however clearly he may perceive the paral- lelisms, is wholly at a loss to classify them according to any known biological system. Lilienfeld insists that they are " real " analogies, by which he seems to mean that they are the identi- cally same structures, organs, and functions that occur in living organisms. There is no scientific basis for even discussing such a proposition. A favorite escape from some of these difficulties is to call society a " superorganism," and Tarde, one of the severest critics of the organic theory, proposes the form "supra-organism" as more clearly expressing the distinction, a view that Novicow is disposed to accept. Lilienfeld declares that the social organism is the highest and furthest developed of all existing organisms; I Fouillee calls it an organism of ideas; and Paulhan and Giddings see in it an organism or association of minds; all of which only shows in how many ways the subject may be viewed. It is obvious to many that the only "analogies" that approach the biological sense of the term, or have such a sig- nificance as to promise any useful results, are those that relate to the organs of control and interadjustment of parts, the "internuncial system," the co-ordinating and subordinating apparatus. This, of course, corresponds to the organs of con- sciousness in the animal organism. in short to the brain and I Gedanken, etc., Vol. I, p. 51.</page><page sequence="15">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 489 nervous system. In other words, the chief and only useful analogies are not properly biological, but psychological. This is because the same psychic qualities that belong to the animal organism are at work in society through the co-operation of its organic units, the minds of men. But although the mind of man is more highly organized than that of lower animals, so that individual men move on a higher psychic plane than individual animals, still the spontaneous activities generated in human society by the interaction of the psychic units in the resultant so-called social consciousness do not, as a matter of fact, pro- duce a co-ordinating system of a high order, nothing approaching the perfect adjustment and subordination of the parts to the whole that we see in any of the developed animal organisms. To find any kind of parallel we are obliged to go down among the lowest organic forms, to the state known as the cormus. Here we find every degree of co-ordination, from the simple colony held together by invisible lines along which the internuncial currents are vaguely propagated, to mere chains of cells with something corresponding to nerves connecting them, and thence on to the earliest segmented organisms. No one can have failed to notice that it is chiefly with such primitive creatures that Mr. Spencer makes his comparisons. He was so much impressed with this necessity that he was finally forced by his critics to say in a foot- note that his comparisons were general, and that "if any specific comparison were made, which it cannot rationally be, it would be to some much lower vertebrate form than the human. " It is a matter of common observation that the deliberations of public bodies of men are not marked by the degree of good sense and judgment that characterizes the best minds that com- pose them. Indeed, they fall below the average intelligence of the members, and probably below that of the least intelligent individuals in such bodies. Spencer remarks that " not only is the corporate conscience lower than the average individual con- science, but the corporate intelligence too." 2 Gabelli has reduced this to the formula that "the faculties of men working I Essays, Scientific, Political, and Speculative (New York, I89I), p. 305. 2 Study of Sociology, p. 289.</page><page sequence="16">490 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY together obliterate each other and are not added together."' Novicow admits that human societies should not be compared with animals as highly differentiated as the higher vertebrates, but with representatives of the Tunicata (barnacles), for example. This, of course, rather supports than opposes his favorite theory that the elite constitute the social consciousness, but that theory has the fatal objection that it leaves society without any central organ of control at all, for whatever may be the moral influence of the elite, it possesses no authority, and purposely keeps aloof from all interference with social events. It is wholly unorganized, and really exerts less power in society than is exercised by unorganized crowds and mobs. These latter, as everybody knows, display the minimum intelligence, and represent the non-rational, animal state, where feeling reigns supreme. We must therefore fall back upon the prevalent view that government or the state is the homologue of the brain and ganglionic hierarchy in the developed animal, and here, it must be confessed, there is a general parallel and quite an array of special parallels. The difficulty with it is that, as already remarked, and as has been perceived by a score of writers, neither the degree of differentiation nor of integration is equal to that of any such animals. We may perhaps be thankful that it is not, for anything approaching it would realize the wildest socialistic dreams. Dr. Pioger, who is not at all fright- ened at this prospect, says: It is not because societies do not constitute living organisms that they resemble those organisms so little, but because at present they are only in a lower stage of their development, and because, if we wished to compare them at all to living organisms, we should do so, not with the higher animals, but with the lower organisms called polyzoans, in which physiological individuali- zation is still imperfect.2 Huxley's celebrated remark on this point in his address before the Midland Institute on October 9, I87I, and published in the I " Le forze degli uomini uniti si elidono e non si sommano" (ARISTIDE GABELLI, L'Istruzione in Italia (Bologna, I89I), Part I, p. 257). 2 DR.

A rude outline of the general conception elaborated in the pre- ceding eleveni chapters was published by me in the Westminster Review for January, i86o. In it I expressly rejected the conception of Plato and Hobbes, that there is a likeness between social organization and the organization of a man's body; saying that "there is no warrant whatever for assuming this." Nevertheless, criticisms upon the article ascribed to me the idea which I had thus distinctly condemned. Whatever may have been Mr. Spencer's motives, it is at least apparent to others that the doctrine, even as set forth by himself in the Westminster Review, is inconsistent with his gen- eral hostility to government and the enlargement of state func- tions. We will next glance, still more briefly, at the other side of the subject, and consider a few of the objections that have been raised to the organic theory of society, and especially endeavor to enumerate the principal respects in which society has been shown to differ from an organism. Merely mentioning the three principal distinctions pointed out by Spencer from the first-viz.: that societies are (i) discrete instead of concrete, (2) asymmetrical instead of symmetrical, and (3) sensitive in all their units, but insensible in their ensemble, in all of which cases the reverse is true of living organisms-we may enumerate, as among the structures, organs, and functions of society which have no proper counterparts in any organic being: language, religion, contract, symbolism, migration, and exportation; and as among those belonging to living organisms which have no proper counterparts in society: birth, death, reproduction. The analogies that have been pointed out in all these cases are admittedly weak and unsatisfactory. The following points that ^Fortnightly Review, New Series, Vol. X, pp. 534, 535.

Societies become more and more settled as they develop, which is the reverse of the process in biology. For example, nomads represent the free swimming state of the lower animals, and the settled societies represent the fixed state, as of polyps, sponges, etc. 2. The higher a society, the less it feels the loss of any organ, the reverse being the case among living organisms. 3. There is nothing in human society to correspond to the great sympathetic plexuses, which have with much truth been called the physical basis of man's moral nature. 4. As regards the elite as the social sensorium, it is well known that intelligence tends to divide men, just as interest (feeling) unites them. The elite is therefore a centrifugal force in society, working for disintegration. All these points-and many more might be adduced-are quite independent of the general biological and classificatory considerations urged at the beginning of this section. About all that is left of the doctrine of the social organism is that society, like an animal or a plant, but also like language, law, the state, art, and science, is something organized-an organization. Organization is a universal or cosmical process, and in its fundamental aspects is very uniform. Society differs fundamentally from an organism in not being a concrete object at all. We cannot properly say that it con- sists of men and women, nor of their material environment, nor of both these together. Man is a species or a genus, according to the scope given to these terms, but society is neither of these, nor any other classific group. It comes nearer to the conception of a herd or flock, of which the individual members are imper- fectly held together by a certain psychic force. It is, however, much more like a corporation, voluntary organization, church, or other association of men. In fact, association is its essence, and sociology is the science of human association. But association is an act, and an association is a product of the act of associating. It is a relation among individuals. Now, a relation is not a</page><page sequence="19">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 493 concrete object. It is an abstract conception. Nothing but the individual is concrete. A species is not a material thing. A genus is only a mental conception. The social-organism theory is a sort of modern revival of the old scholastic realism. The truth is that society is a relation, but when we examine all forms of truth we shall find that most of it is of this class, and also that relations are the most important of all things. IV. SOCIOLOGY AS POLITICAL ECONOMY. So large a part of social phenomena relates to material things that many economists decline to recognize sociology as a science distinct from economics. Of this class we need not speak. There is, however, another class of economists who clearly see that economics as commonly taught fails to include large fields of phenomena that are of the highest importance, especially phenomena relating to population in a broader sense than that usually given to the science of demography. These economists would enlarge the scope of economics to embrace these fields. This department they often designate as social economics or social economy. This latter expression was used by John Stuart Mill when he was trying to find a name for a great science which he clearly saw to exist, distinct from politi- cal economy.' He then said: "This science stands in the same relation to the social as anatomy and physiology to the physical body." The organicists have never, to my knowledge, made any use, as they might have done, of this significant pas- sage, but it is broad enough to serve equally well in character- izing society as an organized body or social organization. But Mill was specially concerned in distinguishing his new-found science from political economy, and he proceeded to do so in a clearly worded paragraph. The germ of this distinction was contained in a passage of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations where he says that "the interest of the dealers in any particular branch of trade or manufacture is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, "London and Westminster Review, Vol. XXVI, October, I836, p. II; Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy, I844, p. I35.</page><page sequence="20">494 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY that of the publick."' This was in the nature of an admission or confession, for Adam Smith defended the utmost liberty in trade and business, and argued with great force that thus only can national prosperity be secured. It was as much his teachings as any other cause that raised up the school of eco- nomists who maintained the opposite doctrine to that above quoted, that the free and spontaneous operation of all economic processes can be depended upon under all circumstances to work for the general good of mankind. This doctrine was finally erected into a sort of economic fetish and bowed down to with implicit faith. It is still strong, but latterly certain influ- ences have been at work which have shaken the faith of many able economists, while the social economists, and especially the sociologists, have long been taking the view above quoted from Adam Smith as their point of departure and striving to discover the broader law under which it falls in a scheme of social science. The tincture given to all economic speculation by Bentham's utilitarianism made the acceptance of the ideas of the Austrian school of economists, with their new definitions of value, more easy and rapid, and attention at length became turned to the question of the true nature of utility. Formerly and normally everything centered on the idea of production-goods, wealth. The new influences tended to direct thought toward consump- tion-men, welfare. Political economy, or economics proper, was seen to be static, while the spirit of the times demanded a dynamic science. It was then seen that considerations of pro- duction are static, while considerations of consumption are dynamic. Mill had said that "political economy has nothing to do with the consumption of wealth,"2 and no one surely was more competent to speak on the subject than he. The modern dynamic economists who start from the standpoint of consump- tion must either admit that they are not dealing with political economy, or they must admit that they have added an entirely "First edition, Dublin, I776, Vol. 1, p. 379, 2Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy, Ist ed., I844, p. 132, footnote.</page><page sequence="21">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 495 new department to the science, reversing in large part its funda- mental tenets. The truth of the matter is that two distinct sciences are here involved, and the fundamental distinction between them is con- fused. It is not merely that one deals with production and wealth, and the other with consumption and welfare, though this is true and clear enough; but the initial standpoint is the opposite in the one from what it is in the other. In political economy the point of departure is the producer, while in soci- ology it is the consumer. But by the producer is not meant the laborer or the artisan, but the undertaker or manager; the man interested in securing the maximum production. And by the consumer is meant all who consume, i. e., the public, society at large. Utility means the same in both, but its application is wholly different. Utility always means satisfaction, but in economics it is satisfaction to the entrepreneur, while in soci- ology it is satisfaction to all who use the product. But there is no necessary harmony between these two satisfactions. Eco- nomics deals with all kinds of business, and any business that remunerates those engaged in it is a success. Just as the term "production" is broadened to include exchange, transportation, and all other operations that in any way affect, or even relate to, a commodity produced," so the term " business " is expanded until it embraces all gainful pursuits that are not so clearly injurious as to be made unlawful. Many kinds of business, indeed those that are the most gainful of all, have scarcely any relation to production in the narrower sense and make no pretension to causing any improvement in the value of commodities. A very large part of the lucrative business conducted in cities is of the nature of speculation, and the idea that speculation is a form of production is simply an economic myth.2 Political economy does not inquire whether a business is I' " Production, in fact, embraces every economic operation except consumption." -J. B. CLARK, The Distribution of Wealth, etc. (New York, 1899), P. 20. 2See the suggestive paper of MR.

For example, in the dairy business, there is no doubt that, if nobody objected, the business could be made more "suc- cessful" by putting water in the milk, and this would be no affair of the economist, even if he knew it. He is only inter- ested in the effect it would have on the business. He might properly discuss, in a truly scientific spirit, the influence of such a proceeding upon the market, and determine with mathematical exactness just how much water "the traffic would bear." This is exactly what economists do in discussing other forms of busi- ness and in deducing the laws controlling prices. They never inquire whether prices are just. They have discovered that, according to the laws of business, which they consider to be laws of nature that no human power can alter, prices will be just as high as is necessary to secure the maximum profits, and no higher. The return to the entrepeneur is determined by two elements: the price of the commodity and the quantity sold. A larger quantity at a lower price may bring greater profits than a smaller quantity at a higher price. If the price is pushed up to the point where the consumer prefers, or is compelled, to do without or to use some cheaper substitute, the sales will fall off and the profits diminish. This is the only check to prices of certain commodities where there is nearly or quite complete monopoly. But in most cases there is, besides this, the check of competition, which, until the laws of aggressive competition were understood, was supposed to keep prices down. It is now known that it tends rather to raise them. But, whatever may be the effects of all these causes, the economist only considers these alleged perfect and unchangeable laws of trade. If the price is three or four times the cost of production, this is looked upon as inevitable. The same is true of rates of transportation, whether of passengers or freight, and, in fact, of all forms of business. The consumer must always pay "all the traffic will bear." The economist is not troubled by any of the moral aspects of the case. That is the affair of the state, or of gov- ernment. The dilution of the milk only enters into his calcula- tion as an element of profit or loss. So also of all forms of</page><page sequence="23">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 497 adulteration or vitiation of goods. The amount of chicory that can be mixed with coffee to adapt the price to a certain class of customers; the sale of oleomargarine for butter; the use of alum in making bread; and, in short, the almost unlimited number of devices resorted to in nearly all departments of business, to cheapen everything, which dealers openly confess that they are compelled to do under pain of failure in business-all this is the legitimate study of the economist from the sole standpoint of the business man. The sociologist takes an entirely different and exactly oppo- site view of all these cases. He says that, if the laws of business do not automatically compel the dairyman to omit the water from his milk entirely and deal in the pure article, there is something wrong about the laws of business. He reasons that when man first set about occupying this planet there were innumerable laws of nature working against him, and he com- menced by little and little to counteract and control these laws; first to render them harmless, and then to make them useful to him, until at last he has succeeded in practically mastering the "laws of nature," and in utilizing everything within his reach. It does not seem to the sociologist probable that, while nearly all physical forces, and many vital and psychic forces, especially in animals and plants, can be thus subjugated to his needs, there is a class of forces and laws called economic that are hopelessly beyond his reach. He cannot see why, if such laws and forces are not working to his advantage, they may not, when thor- oughly understood, be controlled as the others have been, and rendered innocuous at least, or perhaps utilized to man's general advantage. Mention might perhaps be made of another very successful kind of business, though classed as a learned profession, viz., the practice of law; and closely associated with it are a thousand little businesses that require expert legal knowledge. The sys- tem of jurisprudence that has grown up in civilized societies, the purpose of which is to cause security of person and property, is one of the richest heritages of the past, but it has come to employ a much greater number of persons than are necessary.</page><page sequence="24">498 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY Probably all the law business of any country could be done by one-fourth of the present number. The rest are simply para- sites. The way in which they maintain their hold on society is through that other business called politics. Most politicians are lawyers, and this is chiefly due to the facility they acquire in public speaking by their practice before the bar. Business men (merchants, manufacturers, railroad officials, etc.) have no opportunity to speak in public, and therefore, however good their judgment may be on public questions, they cannot attract the attention of the people in such a way as to become promi- nent in political affairs and get themselves sent to legislatures, to parliament, to congress, etc. The result is that legislatures always consist chiefly of lawyers. Nothing more natural than that bodies of lawyers, having the framing of all laws in their hands, should so frame them as to increase the amount of their own business. This, in brief, explains the superfluous law busi- ness of the world, which not only produces nothing in any economic sense of the word, but becomes a great charge and expense, and actually diminishes the degree of security by all manner of fictions and useless technicalities. Now, respecting these non-productive, parasitic, and even injurious employments, economics has nothing to say except simply to consider whether they are successful. All kinds of business are equally legitimate, and even those which the state condemns as dishonest or pernicious are never suppressed at the suggestion of the political economist. So long as they are tol- erated they are proper subjects of economic study, and we know that there is great diversity among states as to what forms of business should be prohibited, as witness legislation relative to lotteries. Sociology, on the other hand, in its applied stage, concerns itself primarily with the question of the public utility of enter- prises. Its standpoint is the good of society. To that end the individual manager of a business may be sacrificed, or, at least, he may be constrained to direct his energies and abilities into some useful channel. The modern interest in sociology is chiefly due to the obvious sterility of political economy. The social</page><page sequence="25">CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGY 499 world is in a somewhat troubled state. The era of machinofac- ture has culminated in such an array of labor-saving inventions that the possibilities of production are well-nigh unlimited, but the capital has become concentrated in relatively few hands, while the artisan class has not acquired the general intelligence necessary to enable them to participate in such a movement. Thus enormous relative inequalities have grown up in modern society. At the same time these very causes have accelerated rather than retarded the rise of the proletariat, and improved the absolute, though not the relative, material condition of the work- ing classes. In a word, they have engendered discontent, which is a state that can only exist above a certain stage of physical and mental advancement. Society, though not in a dangerous condition, is in a sort of ferment, and there has been made pos- sible a social problem, or rather a crowd of social problems. At first appeal was made to the economist, who was supposed to be able to offer a scientific solution of some of these problems. But his answers, though sometimes oracular in form, were about as satisfactory as the opinions of a certain J. Bunsby. More fre- quently he grew impatient and reiterated the traditional eco- nomic injunction against presuming to meddle with the workings of natural law. Many anxious inquirers, wholly discouraged by these cold blasts from high seats of learning, turn to the state and demand a statutory solution of social problems, but the state usually declines to respond, or perhaps adopts measures that fail to accomplish the purpose sought, or even aggravate the difficulties. It is under such a condition of affairs that there has been gradually struggling into existence a new science which seeks a true and fundamental acquaintance with, rather than an immedi- ate solution of, social questions; which is content to wait for such solution until the conditions of these questions are better under- stood. It does not hold them in haughty disdain, nor does it pretend to possess any panacea for social evils, but it is open to inquiry, takes a true scientific interest in social events and phe- nomena for their own sake, and either inhibits its concern for the practical results, or has faith that these will be best subserved</page><page sequence="26">500 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY by first laying in a store of knowledge. This science is sociol- ogy, and there is enough of intellectual stimulus in the study of its pure stage, wholly disconnected from its consequences, to keep quite a corps of earnest investigators in the field working on different lines. But it is obvious at a glance that this science is much broader than that of political economy, even when that is expanded to embrace what is called political science (finance, administration, diplomacy, national enterprises, consular affairs, colonial rela- tions, etc., etc.). These are all related to it, in fact may be included in it, but they do not by any means constitute the whole of it. Relatively to the whole domain of sociology, these are really quite narrow, and it is only their vital character that causes them to appear so all-absorbing. LESTER F. WARD. WASHINGTON, D. C.
