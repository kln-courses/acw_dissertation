Eigeldinger wonders whether the Reveries might be an early version of the nineteenth-century journal intime, but concludes that the form of the work is not truly that of a journal, though it prefigures the genre by its thematique, its exclusive preoccupation with the moi. The study ends with a subtle and perceptive examination of the nature of the ecriture poetique in the Reveries, showing that writing is for Rousseau 'un acte ontologique' (p. 115), not merely the record of an experience, but an experience in itself, which seeks to achieve the poetic fusion of the interior and exterior worlds. All in all, we must be grateful to the University of Neuchatel for making the text of these lectures more widely available.. D. JIMA P. D. JIMACK UNIVERSITY OF STIRLING Michelet's Poetic Vision: A Romantic Philosophy of Nature, Man, and Woman. By EDWARD K. KAPLAN. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press. 1977. ?I2.50. This work sets out to synthesize the views which Michelet expressed in writing on such diverse subjects as natural history, the psychology of love and woman, the 'sociology' of the people, and historiography. The earlier chapters excel in relating Michelet's notion of natural science to currents of ideas in the first part of the nineteenth century, especially the debate over evolution between Cuvier and Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire. Michelet prefers Saint-Hilaire to Cuvier because he upholds freedom against determinism, biblical and other. His science is romantic, but by no means wholly unscientific. It is romantic partly because it is teleological, in the sense that primitive forms of life prepare more 'advanced' forms, like man, of course. The result is, to use Professor Charlton's term, another 'secular religion'. Yet it is important to recognize, as this book does, that Michelet's feeling for nature is deep and genuine, even when it leads him to be fanciful. But he can also intend to be more scientific than one thinks he is being. There is a chapter in La Mer entitled 'La Mer de lait' because of the mucus in the sea - grist to Bachelard's mill, perhaps, if not to Sartre's. For Michelet, it is scientifically exact that sea- water is a mucus. In that case, Bachelard's 'imagination materielle' would not seem to be really applicable here. In general, Professor Kaplan does an expert job in distinguishing between fact and imagination in Michelet's science. What this suffers from, indeed, is not imagination but what the author rightly calls Michelet's 'relentless anthropomorphism'. But, of course, without the anthropomorphism there would be no secular religion. What comes over strongly from this work is that, for Michelet, man's attitude towards animal creation should be compassionate and that his society should learn from nature to be pacific and benevolent. But where is the place of poetic vision in such a scheme of things? Let this question be answered by three examples. The aesthetic creativity of the nightingale's song in L'Oiseau, it is pointed out, reflects the evolutionary process towards freedom, or the song itself is to be seen as a symbol of man's need to transcend his earthly condition. Secondly, a similar process is to be observed in Michelet's conception of history. According to this, France's development towards unity is apprehended as being that of a person growing in freedom as he shakes off the restraints of geography. This goes some way towards explaining why, for Michelet, the French Revolution was a religion. Thirdly, from creativity in history we pass to that of the historian's self. As is</page><page sequence="2">894 Reviews rightly pointed out here, 'Michelet considered his life consubstantial with his creation'. It is precisely this which lies behind his notion of history as an integral resurrection of the past. Thus the 'relentless anthropomorphism' is still there, determining, for all the scrupulous use of archives, that the past shall relive in Michelet's guise. Now, as Professor Kaplan also argues, 'Michelet's synthesis of natural and human history is a projection of the androgynous mind which produced it'. This is to refer to Michelet's notion of 'the two sexes of the mind', to his conception of the complete because androgynous human being. It is then in this androgynous source that the poet and reformer in Michelet have their common source. It is to be hoped that it will not be thought unfair to mention one particular lapse. In a footnote, we read that 'Georges Poulet correctly emphasizes the male sexual rhythm which characterizes Michelet's view of history'. But in that case, what has become of the androgynous Michelet? And it would be no good invoking here the support of R. G. Collingwood. With some reason, he is used to support Michelet's insistence on the historian's need to relive the past. But he would have had no time for the sexual rhythms of historians. This blemish apart, Professor Kaplan has written a penetrating and convin- cingly systematic assessment of Michelet. Strong as he is on background, he has also made an important contribution to the intellectual history of the nineteenth century. HAROLD WARDMAN UNIVERSITY OF LANCASTER Romantisme et reverie. By MARCEL RAYMOND. Paris: Jose Corti. 1978. 298 pp. 88 F. Marcel Raymond's latest book consists of seventeen essays on the dream-like states experienced or described by a wide range of major and minor French writers between roughly I820 and I870. With the exception of the last and longest piece, on the composition ofNerval's Aurilia, these are not scholarly essays but 'invitations a la promenade, ou a la lecture, avec de belles citations'. M. Raymond's notion of the reverie and his typology of its manifestations are well known from his critical editions of the Reveries du promeneur solitaire and his important book, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, la reverie et la quete de soi. The two general essays on reverie included in the present volume add nothing to the earlier work but introduce and justify the following pieces on Chateaubriand, Nodier, Gautier, Maurice de Guerin, Baudelaire, Stendhal, Balzac, Sand, Flaubert, Michelet, Amiel, Hugo, and Nerval. Several of the essays are very short, and many are composed of several one-page or two-page fragments with little explicit linkage. It is the sort of book which will annoy some readers; only a man of the stature of Marcel Raymond could get away with publishing it. Yet with a little good will there is much pleasure to be had from this series of brief meditations, each centred on a well-chosen quotation, which taken together constitute a rambling literary history of the reverie in the nineteenth century. Behind many of them stalks not so much the sentimentality of Rousseau as the inquiring mind of De Quincey. A chapter on the Confessions of an Opium-eater would have added more to the interest of the volume than the insubstantial piece on Balzac, for example.
