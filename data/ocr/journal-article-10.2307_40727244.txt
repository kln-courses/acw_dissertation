Winter, 1997. 384 pp, Appendix, 289 Illustrations. The art of portraiture, one of the most interesting aspects of Far Eastern studies, widely neglected by Western scholars until Richard Vinograd's publication Boundaries of the Self - Chinese Portraits 1600-1900 in 1992, gains further attention with a most noteworthy publication in the tradition of German scholarship. Dietrich Seckel, the renowned author of Buddhistische Kunst Ostasiens (Buddhist Art of East Asia) and other fundamental works in the field of Far Eastern art history, in his recent book exam- ines portraiture throughout its development in China, where it was invented, and then focuses on Japanese portraiture where a greater and more diverse range of works has been preserved. The book helps to get a clearer picture of a wealth of unstructured material, which has now been ordered and correlated in all its complexity by systematic analysis and terminological definitions. The text starts with an extensive intro- duction into the state of research, methodo- logical approaches, and "Fragestellungen," in an overview of the different categories of portrait-like representations. Five subsections deal with the genesis of portraiture. It is traced down from early anthropomorphic de- pictions dating from the stone and bronze ages through the beginnings of representa- tions of human activities in scenic composi- tions to the gradual "humanisation" of figurai representation. During the Han dynasty (206 B.C. -A.D. 221), distinctions between stereo- typical single and group compositions and depictions of individual but anonymous figures in a narrative context are observed. In connection with "idealized portraits" of indi- viduals known by name, the author also refers to the silk banner excavated from the tomb of the Marquise of Dai, who died in the middle of the second century B.C., showing the deceased in profile, leaning on a stick amidst her family or servants. Seckel prefers not to call the miniature facial rendering a portrait (p. 37). It should, however, not be overlooked that the artist accentuated in profile the anatomical anomaly of a deformed</page><page sequence="2">568 Book Reviews and Notes Monumenta Serica 47 ( 1 999) spine from which it was evident (confirmed by her well-preserved mummy) that the woman had suffered. Here, it may be asked whether a "body portrait" of that kind may not have served as a means of individu- alization before representational techniques advanced in facial rendering. The achieve- ment of true portraiture with mimetic depic- tion of physiognomy (xiangshu) is then ex- plained in correlation to the requirement of similarity and representational qualities. The growing diversity in implementation and function (ritualistic, ethical, as memorial eulogy, etc.) towards the end of the first millennium, leads, as Seckel argues, to an in- creasing diversity of portrait types and the skill to transmit individual personality, and reinforce the relation between function and style. During the Tang dynasty (618-960), the portraiture in painting and sculpture is shown as fully mature, though only documented by a limited number of originals almost exclu- sively preserved in Japan. By now, portrai- ture was no longer the preserve of the upper class; commoners as well as emperors would be portrayed. Special focus is laid here on portraits of Buddhist monks, in which facial traits which are depicted with extraordinary realism, stressing the expression of person- ality in contrast to the highly idealized icons of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. According to Seckel, the application of specific kinds of realistic styles which relates to divers levels of spiritual cultivation of the portrayed and deserves attention for the study of later de- pictions of Buddhist or Daoist pantheons where more or less "humanized" deities em- body different stages in the process of enligh- tenment. The specific relation between por- trait and reality in its manifold aspects is dis- cussed in the introduction to Part I. Included is a most instructive exposition of realism in landscape painting which one would expect to find in the main text instead of in a lengthy footnote. Regarding the "true views" in the literati painters' tradition (distinct from the vedute-like views enjoying great popularity in Japan) already created by the 10th-century Chinese painter Ching Hao, however, ter- minological reference would ask for the original Chinese term, chen-ching, in ad- dition to the Japanese term, shinkei. The as- sumption that the Chinese terms tu and hua correspond to mimetic and non-mimetic realism as well as professional and amateur painting requires further discussion, given the fact that in Chinese both terms are often interchangeable (pp. 86-87). The five main portrait types thus introduced are discussed in the following chapters, each preceded by a separate introduction and concluded with a list of technical terms and names in Chinese/ Japanese characters. Chapter I deals with the phenomenon of real presence (Real-Präsenz), a term by which the author summarizes various types of portrayal (or should one, in cases like theyw- ting liu-shenlnyû-jo ru-shin, rather speak of a portrayal-like intention?) in the context of burial rites and the search for eternal life. Here are discussed, (1) the Buddhist concept of entrance into a fixed state of contempla- tion, (2) the mummification of the body for veneration in the sense of a corpse-statue (Leichnam-Statue), and (3) portrait-statues as the closest possible substitute for the deceased in post-mortem rituals of which there are more examples preserved in Japan than in China. The same concerns (4), the concept of "equal body" {teng-shen/tõshin) as an im- portant form of identification between person and image in the portraits of Buddhist monks. (It should be noted that the Chinese term teng refers to outer appearance in general, not only the height of a body.) Category (5) re- fers to portrait statues as receptacles of relics like the ashes of the deceased or other relics, namely, of the Buddha himself. Such iden- tification of a portrayed monk with the Bud- dha-nature of the universe is shown mostly combined with an utmost realistic, only in rare cases with an idealized, depiction of the face. Among those objects inserted in portrait statues to reinforce "real presence," the author notably points out portrait drawings inside portrait statues which are of special</page><page sequence="3">Monumenta Serica 47 ( 1 999) Book Reviews and Notes 569 interest as valuable evidence of traditions pre- served in Japan but originating from China where their traces are lost. The concept of the immortal body is discussed under (6), con- firming Doris Croissant's thesis (1990) that the earliest evidence of portrait sculpture is indeed embodied in effigies used in the archaic forms of ancestor cult. These con- cepts are shown to continue existing side by side with the portrait types dealt with in the following chapters. The real portrait (Real-Portrait) analysed in Chapter II constitutes a most enlightening part of the book. Seckel discusses five basic aspects of the real portrait: function, the relation between appearance and essence, pre-conditions and requirements, demands and limitations, similarity and credibility, si- milarity being dealt with most extensively. Chinese artists and critics hold contrasting views concerning the reflection of spiritual essence in terms of formal reduction versus formal likeness. Seckel concludes that besides literati portrait painting which usually trans- mits a stereotyped ideal of distinguished culti- vation, a remarkable trend for authentic re- flection of character and personality is given evidence by other works which the scholarly reader will rightly associate with academic or court painting and later trends of popular folk art. Further considerations deal with lifetime and posthumous portraits, ancestor portrait, family-likeness, the approach to abnormal facial traits, the Japanese category of nise-e (similarity painting), and problems of mani- pulation. Special attention is paid to the question of verifying the similarity between portraits and the portrayed in East Asian art, in which the author suggests most valuable methods and criteria relating to textual sources as well as pictorial evidence, pointing out the Chan-Buddhist implications concern- ing the problem of true likeness (chen- hsiang). Chapter III discusses a type of por- trait for which Seckel has coined the term traditional portrait (Traditions-Porträt). This category includes the majority of posthumous portraits, based on more or less coherent pic- torial, literary, or at least legendary trans- mission of information on the portrayed. The different channels and modes of this transmis- sion - among which the information passed from teacher to adept through generations in Buddhist monkhood plays an important part - are shown to share the common search for authenticity in depiction. Portraits created ex- clusively or mainly from imagination called imaginary portraits (Ideal-Porträts), with manifold variations are dealt with in Chapter IV. By mingling legendary elements with popular transmission and invention, Seckel takes them for examples of "fiction becoming truth." Taken as substitutes for the real portrait, they are attributed to post-Tang periods. Earlier portrait-like depictions clas- sified as defined portraits (Definitions-Por- träts) are explained by specific iconographical attributes or inscriptions. Repeated re-ar- rangements of physiognomical traits in larger groups of similar figures suggesting but not reflecting individuality are termed typical images (Typenbild). The discussion on imag- inary portraits versus religious icons related to legendary figures and sacred images, would seem to need further elaboration in view of the fact that large sections of later Buddhist art in China have only been con- sidered in general terms. One of the most in- teresting facets of Chinese-Japanese cultural interrelations, however, is the portrait-like depiction based on dream-visions which is studied in detail with due regard to basic con- tributions by Helmut Brinker. In the follow- ing section, numerous examples of Chinese and Japanese "imaginary portraits" are exam- ined: of emperors and other historical fig- ures, Confucius and Laozi as the most promi- nent of wise men, scholars, painters, poets, and famous women. An extensive passage is dedicated to Buddhist monk portraits with special stress on portraits of Hui-neng (638- 713). The material presented offers a broad overview on Japanese secondary sources and points out specific art historical developments which previously received little or no attention. The last chapter on the transform-</page><page sequence="4">570 Book Reviews and Notes Monumenta Serica 47 ( 1 999) ing portrait (Transformations-Porträt) reveals some noteworthy psychological aspects of portraiture. Analysed are different forms of transforming an individual portrait into another profane character or into a sacrosanct image intended to convey the attainment of progressive levels of religious enlightenment. In this context notable political implications in portraits of this type (cf. portraits of Manchu emperors "transformed" into hier- archs of the Tibetan Buddhist church by at- tire) would have seemed worth mentioning. However, occasional complementations seem rather subordinate in view of the enormous task attacked. Three more volumes will com- plete this work: Das Porträt in Ostasien. Dritter Band, Teil III: Porträt-Funktionen {The Portrait in East Asia. Third volume, part III: Functions of the Portrait) has been published in 1999. The second volume on portrayed personages, and the fourth volume on the artistic creation of portraits are to be published in the near future. This book reflects not only extensive research but also contributes immensely to a better understanding of the idea and the image of mankind in Asia. Ursula Toyka-Fuong</page></plain_text>
