By CHARLES MELLEN TYLER, A.M., D.D., Professor of the History and Philosophy of Religion and of Christian Ethics, Cornell University. New York and London, G. P. Putnam's Sons, I897.-PP. Vii, 273- The author of this work makes no claim to special originality. He says " the writer has aimed to give simply a resume' of the conclusions of modern thought " (p. vi). The undertaking, even as thus de- scribed, might, in advance, be pronounced too ambitious. Modern thought, as regards the subjects referred to, is in a ferment. For the</page><page sequence="2">I90 gTHE PHILOSOPHICA4L REVIEW [VOL. VII. most part one can give only the results reached by certain schools of thinkers, or by certain divisions in these schools. What the book really presents is some phases of modern thought with which the author finds himself in agreement. The book is divided into two parts. These are entitled respectively, "The Historic Basis of Religious Belief," and " Ideal Bases of Re- ligious Belief. " A little oddly, neither of these general titles appears in the table of contents. So far as the historical portion is concerned, the writer fulfils his promise and presents certain results that are accepted by nearly all of those who may be called experts in this department of study. With these results he is in general agreement, as well as with the liberal ten- dencies of the time. The idea of a primitive monotheism and that of a Fall find no place in his scheme of history. He admits, in- deed, that there is nothing in Scripture to forbid the assumption of a precosmic Fall; but it is possible that this is said for the satisfaction of those to whom the drama of history would otherwise be incomplete. The author accepts fully the doctrine of evolution, that of religion as well as of everything else; only it is not an aimless evolution, and he grants freely whatever length of time the most enthusiastic evolutionist would claim as necessary for this. In accord with the best authorities, he does not agree with Herbert Spencer that the worship of Nature sprang originally from that of spirits of the dead. He recognizes three stages in the development of religion, of which what may be called nature-worship and the wor- ship of the spirits of the dead form the first two. These two he judges to be independent of one another. Above these he places a third stage which he calls anthropomorphism. It consists in the recognition in the objects of nature of souls similar to those in men. To this last, and not as is done by Tylor and others to the first-named of these stages, he applies the term ' animism.' I confess that this dis- tinction seems to me artificial and confusing. In the second part of the work we meet with a wholly different order of conceptions. We have what may be called indifferently, 'logic winged by faith,' or, ' faith harnessed in the forms of logic.' It may be noticed that there is no hint of the form of proof known as the a posteriori argument, so far, at least, as this is based upon a con- sideration of the physical universe. The author assumes that spiritual things are to be discerned only spiritually. In this respect the book illustrates the general trend of modern theological thought. The author first presents the assumption that human personality im-</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 19I plies a divine personality. He assumes also that force can be con- ceived of by us only as the result of personal will, and that thus the forces active in the physical world are the direct manifestation of God. Passing to the region of ethics, he finds that man's moral constitution requires us " to postulate an ethical being who is immanent in the whole rational and moral history of man " (p. i6o). In this, as well as in his view of force, he is in accord with Dr. Martineau, from whom he quotes freely. The closing chapters, which speak of " Spiritual Love as an Ideal to be Realized," and of " God revealed in Human Progress," appear to me to be the best in the book. The author seems to rejoice to escape even from the form of argument. He recognizes the inadequacy of logic for the discussion of these great themes. He says: " the logical argument may unmask the facts of the God-consciousness, it does not found them" (p. 207). In earnest, sometimes impassioned, language he proceeds to speak of the facts that illustrate the essential relation of man to God. It might have been well to draw with a sharper line the separation between what reason can do and what it cannot; but such logical discrimination did not lie within the plan of the book. The volume is not large and it covers a wide field of discussion. Its strength lies in enthusiastic affirmation rather than in critical distinction, in in- dicating directions rather than in laying out paths. In another edition it would be well to give to the reader a little help in the finding of notes. He is referred, for instance, to ' note I.' He finds 'note I.' at the end of the book; but this is evidently not the ' I. ' He looks at the end of the division with like result. Finally, after a good deal of fumbling of leaves, he finds the object of his search at the end of the chapter. This is, however, but a small blemish in a work which will doubtless bring healthful religious stimulus to many readers. C. C. EVERETT. HARVARD UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
