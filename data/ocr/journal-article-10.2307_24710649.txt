Kok 1996) Wendy Elgersma Helleman Plato has received his share of bad press in this century. A number of signifi cant schools of thought, like existentialism and phenomenology, have openly expressed impatience with Platonic 'essentialism.' He has even been blamed for fascism. Perhaps the problem goes back to Nietzsche's call, at the turn of the century, to be true to the earth, our common mother. His message was aimed at otherworldly, pious Christians who, with a spiritualism worthy of the Platonists, regarded contemplative thought as the way to truth. Like a double edged sword Nietzsche's call was also directed against metaphysics, dogmatism and intellectualism, the fruits of which he confronted in the weighty tomes for which German scholars then were justifiably renowned. It is not surprising that in the Soviet empire, built on Marxist-Leninist atheism, Nietzsche's words feil on receptive ears. Not only were philosophers who dared openly to identify themselves as 'Platonist' or 'idealist' banned, exiled or executed. The teaching of classical antiquity, too, was almost entirely removed from the curriculum; the ancients could be considered only from a highly restricted point of view, via Democritus, Lucretius, or Aristotle.' The Soviet Russians, clearly, were the most radical in implementing the agen da at which Nietzsche only hinted, and today Russians are also more radical in reconsidering the idealist and Platonist tradition so thoroughly trounced only a few decades ago. The acceptance of Marxist-Leninism by the Russians was cer tainly not unconnected to philosophical developments in the rest of Europe, witness the widespread sympathy for communist thought in its various forms, political, economie or philosophical, before and after the second world war.2 If the repression of Platonic and idealist philosophy must be read as an extension of philosophical movements in the rest of Europe, the revived discussion of the role of Plato and the Christian Platonic tradition closely associated with Eastern Orthodoxy, should also have some interest beyond Russia's immédiate borders.3 Living and working in Russia today, my interest in 1 For a brief review of the Marxist approach see F.M. Cornford, "The Marxist View of Ancient Philosophy," originally written in 1942, published in The Unwritlen Philosophy and OtherEssays (Cambridge UP, 1967): 117-137. 2 Neo-Marxism too has had an extensive influence which it continues to have through the theology of libération, which even today forms the basis of much feminist interprétation of Christianity. 3 On the role of Platonism for Eastern Orthodoxy, see my "Orthodoxy and Platonism" Beweging 61 (1997): 63-67.</page><page sequence="2">READING PLATO FOR THE 2 1 ST CENTURY 149 Bos s recent publication on Plato and the tradition based on his vision has certainly been coloured by this experience.4 Beyond these factors, however, my appréciation has been influenced by years of reading early Christian authors and trying to discern the complexities of the rôle of Platonism in their work.3 In the work under considération, Bos positions himself squarely within the tradition of a Calvinist worldview as it affects scholarship. He has directed his concern to générations of scholars, theologians, and even ordinary Christians who were spellbound by Plato. These, he says, in turn transmitted an illegiti mate view of reality, one which prioritizes a transcendent world of intelligible 'being', the world of ideas, while it denigrates the world of everyday reality as an ever-c hanging, corruptible world of 'non-being'. 1. Harnack and the Problematics of 'Hellenization ' One of the first observations I would like to make is the crucial role of Harnack in this discussion of Plato within the Christian tradition. Bos's opening comments refer to the problem posed by Harnack in his Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, first published in the late 19th century, but running to numerous éditions well into this century (7). In his concluding chapter Bos returns to Harnack, acknowledging that his own work serves to show the correctness of Harnack's diagnosis of Christianity; it only needed further nuancing of expression (158). Aside from these remarks and scattered référencés to Harnack, particularly in connection with the discussion of H. Doerrie and C. de Vogel (114-121), Bos does little to enlighten the reader on Adolf von Harnack's (1851-1930) influential analysis of the 'Hellenization' of Christianity. Yet from his basic argument, that through emphasis on rationality and intellectuality Platonism has distorted true Christian faith, and become a stumbling block when taken on by Christians as a defensive 'armament' (11), Bos clearly shows himself comfortable in using Harnack's challenge as point of departure. For the great Lutheran historian of Christianity focused on early acceptance of Greek philosophical concepts as the culprit in the déformation of an (idealized) pristine living faith, namely the concomitant rise of dogma tism and intellectualism in the early church. According to Harnack, the Gnostics with their radical disjunction of spirit and matter demonstrate an acute form of the acceptance of Greek thought; a less acute but no less 4 The author of this review article has been lecturing in the faculty of philosophy at Moscow State University in Russia since 1995, under the auspices of Christian Studies Inter national, the Canadian branch of The International Institute of Christian Studies, based in Kansas City, USA. 3 Aside from a variety of shorter articles, 1 have dealt with the issue in the collection of articles, Hellenization Revisited: Shaping a Christian Response within the Greco-Roman World, (Lanham, MD: UPA, 1994) a work I edited and to which I appended a lengthy essay to inte grate the collection and indicate the impact of the role of Harnack.</page><page sequence="3">150 WENDY ELGERSMA HELLEMAN dangerous form of Hellenizing occurred in the subséquent argumentation of the Catholic church against the Gnostics, for in self-defence it moved toward much stricter formulation of faith commitments in creed and dogma.6 Bos informs the reader that for him the question arose from his wrestling with D.H.Th. Vollenhoven's position on the fathers as sy η thesizing bil) Lie a 1 faith and pagan Greek thought, and H. Dooyeweerd's views on the four religious groundmotifs (8). But in this publication we do not fmd much explicit analysis of Dooyeweerd's or Vollenhoven's position either.7 His acceptance of a Dooyeweerdian philosophical approach is clear from analysis of the Platonic Ideas in terms of an absolutization of the logical aspect at the expense of physical or biotic aspects of reality (84-87). Bos also agrees with Dooyeweerd and Vollenhoven in repudiating a Scholastic approach, particularly in dis sociating himself from those, like C. de Vogel, who regarded Greek philosophy positively as a praeparatio euangelica, a 'providential' préparation for Christianity. I have argued elsewhere that positions of reformational scholars like D.H.Th. Vollenhoven and K.J. Popma on the fathers as synthesizing Christian faith and Greek philosophy can hardly be understood without taking into account the background of the argumentation of Harnack.8 For this process Harnack used the terms Hellenization and seculanzation as alternâtes. Dooye weerd and Vollenhoven used synthesis to characterize the same unfortunate turn of events, when non-Christian (ie. pagan) philosophies are seen to have influenced Christian faith-expression; thus the term désignâtes an illegitimate combination of positions which are ultimately rooted in opposing religious commitments. Among Reformational scholars the word synthesis has been applied widely to patristic and médiéval scholasic Christian philosophy, almost exclusively in a negaüve way. It is entirely understandable that reformational scholars of the earlier part of this century should have used the analysis of Harnack in their discussion of early Christianity. From Bos's extensive interaction with C. de Vogel and H. Doerrie, if not from his own discussion of Harnack, it is clear that the questions raised by the latter have not disappeared. Nonetheless, in the past few decades much has been written about Harnack's approach, questioning his methods and conclusions, particularly his understanding of both Hellenistic Judaism and Gnosticism.9 During this time it has also become clear that current widespread neglect or répudiation of the historie Christian creeds, with their b I have dealt with Harnack's romanticizing of early Christianity, and the effects of historicism in his analysis of 'Hellenization' at greater length in my épilogue for Hellenization Revisited, 430-454. 7 His discussion of Dooyeweerd is adressed elsewhere; see A.P. Bos, "H.Dooyeweerd en de Wijsbegeerte van de Oudheid" in H. Dooyeweerd (1894-1977). Breedte en actualiteit van zijn filosofie. (Kampen: J.H. Kok, 1994): 197-227. 8 See my Hellenization Revisited 462-64; also my discussion of K.J. Popma, "K.J.

Instead, he only returns to the obvious corollary, how the Christian faith could so easily have been influenced by Greek philosophy; why did it not answer the threat with its own authentic power for renewal (9)? And from this he goes on to pose once again the classic question of 'faith and reason', or (as it is now more typically formulated) 'religion and culture'.11 Much of his analysis of Philo and Augustine, the two authors most cited to exemplify later use of Plato, serves ultimately to reinforce Harnack's verdict of intellectualization, or Vollenhoven's on synthesis. In this respect Bos only reinforces the one-sided approach which characterizes far too many contemporary studies of early Christian authors; these analyze use of philosophical terminology or positions with hardly an attempt to understand the Christian arguments into which they were incorporated, or situate these in the historical conditions which gave rise to such use.12 It is easy enough to see shortcomings and condemn from hindsight; more constructive would be an analysis of how Christians like Justin Martyr, or Clement of Alexandria, using the tools at their disposai, challenged their pagan counterparts, and used their Christian understanding to change the nature of the discussion.13 In this connection it is refreshing to note the very different approach in using the term 'synthesis' in Russian religious philosophy. Here we find the term used self-consciously in a positive sense to indicate Christian interaction with contemporary developments in philosophy. A typical example can be 10 Cf. Hellenization Revisited 435-36; 453; 477-79. 11 In this book Bos expends at least as much of his energies on this question as he does on Plato and Platonism as such; he starts with Philo, not really coming to grips with Plato himself until the seventh, of ten chapters. In the fourth chapter (39-40), he only briefly (with help from citations of Pannenberg) examines how Plato prefers a rational, philosophical account when 'uncritically' rejecting mythology. 12 Discussions like that of I.P. Sheldon-Williams on the Cappadocians in The Cambridge History of Later Greék and Early Médiéval Philosophy, A.H. Armstrong ed. (Cambridge UP, 1967): 425-456, may have been intended particularly to portray the positions of the Cappadocian trio as firmly embedded in current philosophical discussion of Platonists and Stoics. As such it fulfils one useful function, situating authors like Gregory of Nyssa in the midst of current discussions; but from such discussions one has little sense of the enormous rôle they played in laying the foundations for Eastern Orthodoxy, where Gregory of Nyssa is considered one of its great, if not the greatest of Christian philosophers of the early period. The more important question of how these men, as Christians, reshaped current discus sions remains; for Christians the issue of their participation in the discussions of their own time is not as interesting as the question of how, from Christian insight, they changed the meaning of the discussion. From this perspective Vladimir Lossky may be given as an exam ple of a more subde analysis of apophatic or négative theological arguments in Clement of Alexandria and Dionysius the Areopagite; see the essay "Apophasis and Trinitarian Theo logy" in his In the Image and Likeness of God (London and Oxford: Mowbrays, 1975): 13-29. '3 There is some current work which is of interest in tackling the question of 'synthesis' in quite a different manner; from the introductory essay of Apologetics in the Roman Empire: Pagans, Jews, and Christians, MarkJ. Edward et al. eds., (Clarendon Press, 1999) this study clearly wants to take another look of Justin Martyr's apologetics as the context of his famous introduction of'logos' theology.</page><page sequence="5">152 WENDY ELGERSMA HELLEMAN given from a recent discussion of Nikolai Berdyaev's (1874-1948) and Sergei Bulgakov's (1871-1944) critique of Neo-Kantianism; M.A. Meerson notes, "Russian criticism was ... carried out within the framework of religious philosophy which strove to achieve a new synthesis of the Eastern Orthodox religious tradition with the most sophisticated achievements of contemporary philosophy."14 Although results of such discussions are seldom received with unanimity, certainly among Russians, the self-conscious expression of the need for interaction with contemporary schools of thought to evaluate and critique, represents a healthy récognition of what happens in the history of philosophy in those situations typically labeled as Hellenizing, or synthesizing. Christians inevitably find themselves 'in' the world; but if they are also seen to be 'of the world, they have not fulfilled their calling. 2. Philo and Allegorical reading of Scripture Bos begins his portrayal of the role of Platonism in Christianity by quoting lengthy excerpts from Philo of AJexandria, from his allegorizing accounts of création, and of Abraham, Hagar and Sarah (Gen.16). Early Christians accepted Philo's allegorical interprétation of the Old Testament, for they, too, no longer took its laws and sacrifices literally, yet, unlike Gnostics, did not disregard them totally. Through his use of Greek philosophical terms and views in these allégories, Philo won for himself a crucial transitional role in the history of Christian Platonism (19). Of course, allegory could be wielded as a powerful hermeneutical tooi, allowing the unscrupulous to read almost anything into a text—especially if that text presented God anthropomorphically. In the fifth chapter Bos cites an early work of H.M. Kuitert on problems connected with anthropomorphic portrayal of God in the Old Testament; these problems came to a head with the Gnostics, yet Kuitert traced them back to Philo and his Platonizing analysis of the divine. Allegory appears to have been significant in justifying Christian adaptation of non-Christian cultural achievements, namely in the 'spoliatio' theme typically associated with Augustine: just as the Israélites 'spoiled' the Egyptians so Christians make use of the goods of their non-Christian neighbours. In this instance allegory, by legitimizing 'spoliatio', paved the way for (selective) appropriation of pagan thought patterns. Bos counters that the two kinds of 'goods' are incommensurable; how can one compare the borrowing of philosophical positions with use of a neighbour's jewelry or clothing? Moreover, the motif is based on an allegorical interprétation of the Exodus passage, and thus relies on a method which, according to Bos, is 'manifestly pagan' in origin (61). Allegory, indeed, was popularized by the Stoics and became a favourite tooi for Hellenistic interprétation of Homer's Iliacl and Odyssey. Was it really just a 14 Michael M. Meerson, "Pul' against Logos: the Critique of Kant and Neo-Kantianism by Russian Religious Philosophers in the beginning of the Twentieth Century" Studies in East European Thoughl 47 (1995): 225-243, quotation from 240.</page><page sequence="6">READING PLATO FOR THE 2 1 ST CENTURY 153 pagan invention? We need only look at some of the accounts of the Old Testament prophets to recognize the limitations of such a view; most noteworthy, perhaps is the extended 'allegory' of unfaithful Jérusalem in Ezekiel 16. And in the New Testament Paul seems ready enough to engage in the kind of polemics characteristic of the use of allegory in his discussion of Hagar and Sarah as the old and new covenant, respectively, in Galatians 4. Of course, it could abused; the ancients too were well aware of this. Basil of Caesarea, however much he may have been under the spell of Origen and Alexandrian views in theology, explicitly restricted use of allegorical inter prétation in his exegetical work on Genesis. The consensus of early Christianity on hermeneutics shows an acceptance of a fourfold sense of scripture, as expressed by Tyconius: literal, allegorical, tropological (moral) and anagogical (spiritual reading).15 Exegetical application was never rigid, and it is clear that in practice anagogical and allegorical readings overlapped in expressing a typological understanding of the Old Testament for early Christians. The potential for abuse does not itself disqualify a tooi for proper use. In our own century allegory was indeed useful under conditions of war when open expression of views could be fatal; a noteworthy example was the performance of J. Anouilh's Antigone in Paris while occupied by the Germans. The author's subtext was not lost on the audience. The approach was well known and much used also by dissidents in the USSR. A good example is the use of national, traditional legends by the well-known Khirghiz novelist Ch. Aitmatov (b.1928). In antiquity allegory was developed as a highly sophisticated method of carrying on philosophical discussion. My examination of the allegorical discussions of Homeric Penelope and her suitors has uncovered such a polemic.16 The fact that, in our time, we have no taste or need for such an approach should not blind us to its use in the period in which the early church took root. The 'spoliatio' motif has been the subject of much discussion, particularly since H. Richard Niebuhr featured this motif in his classic treatment in Christ and Culture.11 A. Wolters, in his discussion of this motif, has shown with regard to 'spoliatio' that the accent is not on 'use', or 'appropriation' of matters found also among pagans; rather, Augustine's verb amvertere is significant, indicating that such objects must be transformed or restored to the use for which they were created, to contribute to the worship of God.18 Among contemporary reformational scholars J. Klapwijk has done much to develop ' transformational philosophy' as an alternative method for understanding the relationship between the work of Christians and the non-Christian 15 See Κ. Froehlich, éd., Biblical Interprétation in the Early Church (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984),28. 16 See my "Penelope as Lady Philosophy" Phoenix 49 (1995): 288-302. 17 Often reprinted, it was first published in New York by Harper and Row (1951). 18 Α.

Helleman ed., Christianity and the Classics: the Acceptance of a Héritage (Lanham MD: UPA, 1990): 189-203, especially 198-99. Bos only mentions in passing the goal of using such pagan objects for the service of God (61), but does not develop this aspect.</page><page sequence="7">154 WENDY ELGERSMA HELLEMAN philosophical positions which form the context for such work.19 Without accepting all of Klapwijk's argumentation, I have found such a method fruitful for an sensitive understanding of the dynamics in early Christian philosophizing. 3. Plato 's Absolutization of the Logical Aspect With the seventh chapter Bos gets to the heart of his argument: Plato's role as source of 'the god of the philosophers', who, since Pascal, has often been juxtaposed with the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.20 To understand Plato's ontology Bos takes the reader back to the Eleatic Parmenides. This giant of early Greek philosophy took ground rules of rational thought (A = A; A * ~A), and through metabasis eis allo genos transposed them onto reality, with his statements: "being is" and "non-being is not". While correctly observing the logical identity of 'being' with itself (and the otherness of 'non-being'), he wrongly used logical differentiation of thought-objects as the criterion for all reality (83). Compared to Parmenides, Plato made more allowance for the 'non-being' of sensible reality, the aistheton. But, with Aristotle, Bos claims that Plato never satisfactorily explained how a subject could make the transition from 'nonbeing' to 'being', thus 'becoming' nonidentical with itself. By use of Dooyeweerdian modal analysis Bos shows how Plato recognized varied functioning (biotic or physical) in reality; but through his use of (logical) identity and otherness, as the key to sensible reality, Plato reduced the varied functions to a logically qualified process ruled by divine intellect.21 By abstracting a part from the world of reality, the object of knowledge, and raising it to a divine status, Plato continued what Parmenides began with his metabasis. Misinterpreting the necessary identity of thought-objects with themselves as the timeless (and divine) identity of objects themselves, Plato, like Parmenides, misrepresented basic rules of logical analysis as rules of being. Bos, accordingly, disagrees with Vollenhoven's appréciation of the norma tive aspect of the Platonic ideas, for Vollenhoven recognized in Plato's work a first acceptance of the law-side of création (88-89). Socrates' search for défini tions, ie. predicates or universals, according to Bos, only led to an identifica tion of the logical aspect of things. Ideas like justice, beauty, or piety, of which Plato spoke as transcendent and divine, belong rather to the human process of 19 See his "Antithesis, Synthesis, and the Idea of Transformational Philosophy" Phibsophia Reformata 51 (1986): 138-152, as well as the épilogue of Bringing into Captivity every Thought, J. Klapwijk et al. eds. (Lanham MD: UPA, 1991). My own discussion can be found in Hellmization Revisited, 470472; cf. 461-62. It is of interest that although Bos does not agree with Klapwijk, witness his 'Transformation and Déformation in Philosophy" Phibsophia Reformata 52 (1987): 135-138, his polemic with Klapwijk does not surface in the present work on Plato, except in a brief note (75, note 38). 20 In a crucial transitional paragraph Bos affirms that the Hellenizing process described in earlier chapters can be accounted for only by Plato's ontology, which differed substantially from a biblical approach because, in continuity with Greek popular religion, it divinized a part of what is created by first abstracting it ffom its context (76). 21 Advocating dihaeresis (distinction) and synagooge (recombination) to establish a hier archy from 'higher', more inclusive ideas to 'lower' ideas of the more particular, Plato developed the logical aspect to characterize internai relationships among the ideas (84).</page><page sequence="8">READING PLATO FOR THE 21ST CENTURY 155 knowing, which involves both subject and object (85). Furthermore, according to Bos, in developing the Ideas Plato misunderstood a basic distinction be tween what is individual, concrete, and what is général or law-abiding in know ledge; thus his corresponding distinction between what is accessible to sense perception and that which transcends visible reality is also illegitimate (86). What is noteworthy in this account is the extent to which Bos refers to Aristotle and accepts the latter's critique of Plato's world of transcendent, self identical ideas, as an unnecessary doubling of reality (86). His desire to lower the profile of Plato as 'Philosopher of the Transcendent' is clearly fueled also by polemical interaction with C. de Vogel (84-89). Furthermore, Bos seems quite willing to turn to a neo-positivist critique of the 'metaphysics of being' as an abuse of language (89-90), to support his approach to Plato. What is at issue here, finally, is not only Bos's incisive analysis of Ideas in terms of abstractions of the analytical, lawful side of reality; discussion of such analysis can be pursued elsewhere, to determine its effectiveness in accounting for the Ideas in the Platonic corpus.22 The important question is whether Plato, or any of us for that matter, can say anything meaningful about that which transcends the immédiate horizon of our experience. This proves to be an important factor in Bos's évaluation of Plato, especially the Ideas. Even while recognizing that Neo-Kantian appréciation of the Ideas, as products of human thought, does not do justice to their role as presupposition of all thought and knowledge, Bos nevertheless asserts that he cannot 'follow' Plato in regarding the presuppositions of human thought to be based in a transcendent, divine order (85).23 Is this not precisely the root of the problem? Bos has confused analysis of Plato with the issue of agreement with Plato on his positions. The result is nothing less than a complete reversai, a turning upside down of the traditional view of Plato and his 'transcendent world of Ideas'. The clue to his insistence that Plato can not be talking about anything transcendent, lies in Bos's own claim that the presuppositions for human knowledge are not to be sought beyond the horizon of human experience. It is possible to understand such a conclusion in terms of a Dooyeweerdian philosophical approach; it is also in harmony with our typically modern anti-metaphysical worldview. But it leaves unanswered the question of the status of apriori first principles used by the scholar to integrate knowledge, principles which Bos claims to be significant in his discussion with E.P. Meijering (106). It also neglects the issue of religious motivation for philosophical thought. Beyond this, I would argue that Bos's conclusions do little to open up scholarly work, further attempts at under standing the written work of Plato, or, for that matter, any influence he may 22 From other discussions with Bos, I am aware of his supporting the 'unwritten doc trines' as a significant clue to the work of Plato, joining thus in the Tubingen project, for which see H.J. Kraemer, Plato and the Foundations of Melaphysics (Albany: State University of NY Press, 1990). However, no explicit discussion of this matter is given in the present work. 23 "Maar terwijl Plato die mogelijkheidsvoorwaarde voor alle denken gelegen achtte in een transcendente, goddelijke orde, zullen wij hem daarin niet kunnen volgen. De mogelijkheidsvoorwaarde voor het menselijk denken is gelegen in de kenbaarheid van de (geschapen) ervaringswerkelijkheid (85)."</page><page sequence="9">156 WENDY ELGERSMA HELLEMAN have had on early Christianity, which valued Platonism as counterweight to materialist positions, like those of Stoics or Epicureans. His conclusions, moreover, are based on a very narrow window on the Platonic corpus; one must ask where they leave Plato's very concrete concern for justice in the state, the question of immortality and pre-existence of the soul, his use of myth, the role of eros, to mention just a few of the larger themes which come to mind.24 Bos's approach fails to do justice particularly to the normative character of Plato's Ideas, his oft-repeated emphasis on the perfection of the intelligible object when compared with its image, perhaps most eloquently in the Symposium 210-212. From this perspective Vollenhoven's analysis was more insightful. The unfortunate conséquences of Bos's project are especially clear from his rather off-hand réduction of Plato's discussion of body, soul and intellect as substantivizations resulting from human abstraction of physical, biological and logical/analytical functions in the concrete human being (87). 4. Christian Platonism Bos concludes his lengthy seventh chapter by calling attention to a number of concrete problems posed by Platonism, beginning with Christian acceptance of Plato's view of knowledge in a theory of illumination. Even more important was the development of Christian metaphysics from the interprétation of God's name, the "I am" of Exodus 3.14. Calling on H.M. Kuitert's analysis of the passage in Hebrew, Bos explains that there is no basis to connect this passage with Greek philosophical spéculation on being (95). The création in its entirety in Genesis 1 was declared good, but Platonists broke up its unity with their gradations of being, accounting for the less perfect in terms of relative indefmiteness or formlessness; thus they attribute to structural variation what Genesis 3 explains as the result of sin (90). This discussion is continued in the ninth chapter, where Bos gives a more lengthy analysis of early Christian understanding of création, particularly when based on Platonism, again, channeled through Philo.25 With the eighth chapter Bos turns to contemporary discussion of Christian Platonism, represented by H. Doerrie, C. de Vogel, and E.P. Meijering. Bos does not justify his choice of these scholars, while many others are listed in the bibliography. These, certainly, would be more familiar to immédiate readers in the Netherlands. However, one wonders why Bos did not devote at least some attention to the French school represented by scholars like J. Daniélou or P. Hadot, or English Platonists, like A.H. Armstrong.26 24 It was of interest to me to note that this list corresponds closely to that of G. Reale's qualifications of the theses of the school of Tubingen, in his introduction to the Italian édition, translated (p.xxv) in the SUNY édition of H.J. Kraemer, Plato and the Foundations of Melaphysics. ^ In fact, Bos shows that even Augustine's view of God, as a God of both unchanging substance and of mercy, can be traced back to Philo's influential contrast between God's absolute self-sufficiency, which transcends knowledge, and, on the other hand, his logos or the powers (dynameis) by which he relates to humanity (96). 2h Publications of the three authors whom Bos introducés here are undoubtedly rele vant for his argument, but it is difficult to accept the supposition that only these authors</page><page sequence="10">READING PLATO FOR THE 2 1ST CENTURY 157 Bos begins with H. Doerrie's claim that early Christians, by accepting Christ as highest authority, did not sell out to Platonism, as Harnack thought (114). They rejected its religious root, ie. its goal of knowing God. Christians likewise rejected key Platonic positions on the eternity of the cosmos, or gradations of being (100). Early Christian use of Platonic language, according to Doerrie, was no more than a strategy to demonstrate the intellectual respectability of Christianity, with the ultimate goal of the dismissal of Platonism (117). In response, Bos remarks that Doerrie has ignored the heart of the Platonic tradition, its crucial distinction between the visible and invisible, between the temporal and eternal world of ideas. This explains Doerrie's acceptance of Platonic metaphysics, turning a blind eye to the pernicious synthesis of intellectualism with a biblical vision of reality (103). In E.P. Meijering's response to Doerrie, Bos faults him, in turn, for ignoring apriori first principles which all scholars use as a framework in integrating new knowledge (106). Meijering's historical method for discovering what was 'truly Platonic' in the work of the fathers according to Bos reveals, rather, his own positivistic, critical view of knowledge.27 Nonetheless Meijering's final assess ment, that Platonism did penetrate to the very heart of Christianity, is not altogether incongenial for Bos. Unlike Doerrie, Meijering finds that Platonist views on unchangeable 'being' have been (illegitimately) applied to God, and that 'gradations of being' caused problème for a Christian understanding in the Arian dispute and in the discussion of the trinity (109-10). The approach of C. de Vogel is rather different, since she agreed with Harnack that Christianity was Platonized, but differed from him, with her positive appréciation of this. De Vogel affïrmed Philo's use of Platonic ideas to explain the genesis of cosmos. For her, an all-encompassing vision of reality, and a higher évaluation of spiritual (as opposed to material) matters provided the bridge between Platonism and Christianity (119). Surveying this discussion Bos concludes that apparently strong disagree ments between Doerrie and de Vogel have only masked agreement on a more basic issue, the acceptability of Platonic ontology and Greek metaphysics for the Christian tradition (120). This is further clarified from the discussion of de Vogel's own Platonizing view of création (in the ninth chapter).28 have clearly stated the problem. The question of Hellenization has been on the agenda of the Oxford Patristics conferences for some générations already. And even a cursory glance at books in patristic scholarship which are now in print demonstrates the frequent occurrence of the theme of Christianity and Hellenism. In the latest Variorum catalogue, for instance, we find listings of A.H. Armstrong's Hellenic and Christian Studies (1990), as well as his Plotinian and Christian Studies (1979); J-M. Rist's Platonism and its Christian Héritage (1996); and John Whittaker's Studies in Platonism and Patristic Thoughl (1984). 27 Meijering's historicizing approach is shown in agreeing (with Grant) that faith expres sions have no absolute authority, but are historically qualifïed; thus, says Bos, Meijering takes distance ffom all who, with the fathers, accept the possibility of finding truth (108). 28 According to de Vogel, Plato recognized essential principles of création like 1) dependence of the relative on the absolute, and 2) création of what is relative proceeds not of necessity, but by the will of the absolute (151). In his response Bos returns to his earlier questioning of Plato's explanation of 'becoming' as a transition from non-being to being, and finds her position riddled with contradictions.</page><page sequence="11">158 WENDY ELGERSMA HELLEMAN In a short final chapter, Bos turns to one further issue raised by E.P. Meijering as well as D.T. Runia: were early Christians historically 'determined' in their use of Platonic ontology? Was use of the language of their time a décisive factor? Bos answers that if only they had analyzed Platonism more carefully, they would have avoided the pitfalls of Hellenization—a process which Bos compares with contemporary 'Christian Marxism' or 'Christian existentialism' (109-10). Bos concédés that ultimate loyalty to Christ need not be questioned for early Christians, and that they could not very well have side-stepped the challenge of Greek philosophy. But he laments the failure of these Christians to provide a real critique of Platonism in antiquity, their inability to recognize the all-inclusive claims of faith and the proper limits of rational thought as a secure basis for knowledge and reaüty (156). Acceptance of Platonic ontology affected their view of création negatively; philosophical concepts posed many obstacles for understanding the incarnation of Christ as the Logos, especially in the subordinationist controversy with Arians (156). For Bos the verdict of Harnack on the Hellenization of Christianity remains (158-9). 5. Refledions from a Different Perspedive Given his analysis of Plato's ontology of being, Bos's conclusion on a more fundamental agreement between Doerrie and de Vogel is not surprising. The issue of the 'chain of being' is of interest in itself, and deserves further considération. But before going any further in this direction, it may be useful to focus briefly on the very different approach in identifying what is 'divine' which characterized the ancient world. For them, talk of the divine was as natural in philosophy as talk of beauty and reason. While contemporary academie discussion in philosophy typically still has little patience with a déclaration of religious positioning, the inner connection of religion and philosophy is a point which needs no belabouring for the ancients. 5.1. Plato in Russia This shameless acknowledgment of 'the divine' in ancient philosophy may well have contributed to the considérable restrictions placed on the teaching of antiquity under communism in the Soviet Union. Classical studies were completely contraband for a number of decades after the 1917 Révolution.29 29 All gymnasia, with their curriculum characteristically focused on ancient languages, were shut down. Only during the 1930's and even more during the second world war was the study of classical literature revived on a limited basis at Moscow State University and a few other institutions of higher learning. Today there are only two universities which have a substantial faculty in ancient philology, in Moscow and St. Petersburg. But many 'secondary' schools are once again revising their curriculum to look more like a traditional gymnasium. Some of these are clearly oriented to an 'elite', for, unlike state schools, they charge tuition. But it appears that many parents are willing to scrape together what is needed to make such an éducation available for their children, recognizing its value after decades when it was impossible.</page><page sequence="12">READING PLATO FOR THE 2 1 ST CENTURY 159 Indeed, the one person most responsible for keeping a sense of the Greco Roman past alive was, by his own admission, a Christian Neo-Platonist, Alexei Feodorovich Losev. He was certainly not blind to the pagan contours of Plato's work, and often acknowledged Plato as the pagan philosopher par excellence. He was also well aware of Lenin's categorization of all philosophers as realist or idealist; only the former had any legitimacy in the Bolshevik regime. Intellectuals who could not agree with this verdict were exiled or executed. Aristotle, Democritus, Epicurus, or Lucretius were acceptable; Plato was not. Lenin knew very well that this blow was aimed not at philosophers connected with the universities, but at the church. Why? Unlike Protestants, the Orthodox have not restricted use of the term 'patristic' theology to the period of the early councils. They emphasize continued close connections, in liturgy or in the expression of faith, with earliest traditions from the Cappadocians, Diony sius the Areopagite, or Maximus the Confessor; and much of their work is recognizably Platonizing in character. Once the communists had managed to exile or otherwise silence most who were identifïed with the Russian tradition of religious philosophy, particularly as inspired by the séminal work of V.S. Solovyov,30 Losev regarded it as his special mission to try to keep this Christian vision alive in Russia. It was not long before he too ran afoul of the powers of the state. In 1930 he was arrested and spent three years (out of a ten-year sentence) working on the Baltic-White Sea canal. After his release, effected in part through international pressure on communist authorities, his work was carefully watched and restricted. After the death of Stalin he regained limited freedom to publish, and the 8-volume "History of Aesthetics of Antiquity" covering the period from the early Greek world to the Renaissance, published between 1963-92, must surely be regarded as the grand task of the last thirty years of his life. In a sense aesthetics provided a necessary cover for his desire to deal with ancient philosophy (which was still off limits). But he also regarded aesthetic appréciation positively as a fundamental component of the cosmic vision of the ancients. Through this major project Losev helped educate an entire génération deprived of the traditional 'gymnasium' éducation in classical literature. 5.2. Christian Platonism: a current issue The story of Losev shows that the issue of Christian Platonism is not dead, nor merely of academie interest in contemporary Russia. Particularly among the Orthodox it is the subject of heated debate. Many Orthodox church officials today take distance from the legacy of Solovyov, inheriting a suspicious attitude from ecclesiastical denunciations in the 1930's of his successor and interpréter, the well-known Paris-based theologian Sergei Bulgakov. Today writers like Nikolai Gavriushin assert that the acceptance of Platonism by Christians will 30 The work of the late 19th century philosopher, Vladimir Sergeevich Solovyov, was instrumental in revitalizing the Christian faith commitment of many who, like N.Berdyaev, had earlier been committed to Marxist thought. Almost all were exiled in the early 1920's.</page><page sequence="13">160 WENDY ELGERSMA HELLEMAN lead only to further paganizing.31 On the other hand there are Christian philosophers like Konstantin Ivanov of 'Open Christianity' in St. Petersburg, who, when he first read Calvin's Institutes in the recently completed Russian translation, told us how much he appreciated it, not only for its help in opening up the scriptures, but because he recognized there the Plato nizing themes with which he was familiar from the Greek fathers and from Augustine. So we may ask how Russians could appreciate Bos's critique of rationalism and the intellectualist tradition associated with Christian Platonism, his analysis of the logical processes by which Plato established his view of divine 'being'? Of course, Bos did not write with a Russian audience in mind, and was probably quite unaware of the controversial nature of the issue here.32 Indeed, Russian scholarship of this century remained necessarily isolated, though this was not the case in previous centuries. The critique of Kant and Enlightenment rationalism certainly made their impact, with a négative reception, at least initially. The denunciation of religion and theology characterizing positivism also made its impact through the reductionistic, materialistic views of Marx and Engels; as was noted above, Nietzsche's anti-Christian invectives were widely known and used. In this respect, at least, Russia has learned well, and corne out on the other side of a bitter lesson which may not yet have been fully learned in the West. To begin, we must note that due to the peculiar nature of the history of philosophical discussion in Russia, the rational, 'analytical' Plato presented by Bos would hardly be recognized. Here Plato has been read almost exclusively through the eyes of the Neoplatonic tradition, Plotinus or Proclus, and alongside the work of Greek and Byzantine fathers. For Russians, Plato is a mystic, and the rôle of Plato is deeply interwoven with the Orthodox Christian mystical expression of faith; for them it means especially proper respect and reverent attitude to God in prayer. Which took priority, the interprétation of Plato, or characterizadon of the faith, we might ask. I doubt that this question would be intelligible to most Orthodox. After ail, most Russians consider rationalism (with individualism) the chief disease of a Western mentality, if not the special problem of Protestantism. Traditional arguments for God's existence, like that of Anselm, have never been greatly appreciated. So they would be highly surprised at what Bos has determined as the basic issue for Christian Platonism. Perhaps they could learn something from his critical analysis, for Bos has certainly arrived at some thought-provoking conclusions regarding Plato's absolutization of the 31 At a recent conference on Solovyov sponsored by the Catholic University of Nijmegen (Sept/98) he supported this contention by quoting passages of Florenski and Losev in which they praise the autocratie ruler of the day. Because such work bears clear marks of being written under duress while imprisoned, perhaps even written over their signature, very few scholars regard this as acceptable witness to their positions. 32 Neither the bibliography or argumentation of the book show any récognition of the work of Vladimir Lossky, Georges Florovsky, or John Meyendorff, many of whose works are available in English, while those of V.S. Solovyov or A.F. Losev, less accessible in English, have appeared in German translation.</page><page sequence="14">READING PLATO FOR THE 21ST CENTURY 161 human intellect and its logical functioning. But perhaps this situation should also lead us to re-examine what is supposedly the fundamental character of Plato's work, taking another look at the question raised by such an examination, namely, how we are to read Plato correctly. In this connection it is instructive to recall that Doerrie's list of problematic features of Platonism seems to have overlooked entirely an aspect which Bos considered most vital. 6. How are we to read Plaio ? So we come back to the question of the fundamental character of Plato's work, and the associated question of how we are to read Plato correctly. Is there one correct way to read an author, particularly an ancient author? This was the position of the historical critical school of interprétation; referred to as the grammatical-historical approach in biblical studies, it is a method which has long been widely accepted. It calls for reading the book according to the author's own intention. Establishing the biographical and historical details of author and period, examining the social and cultural context of the work so it can be understood in its proper context, are high on the agenda for this method.33 It is undoubtedly true that one's understanding of an author and his/her message, the language, and technique of argumentation can be enriched immeasurably from this approach. In the study of classical authors this approach has held the field for many decades. And with such positive results, it should certainly not be abandoned lightly. Nor are the new methods con nected with deconstructionism much more attractive. With these, an audience /reader focused approach is content to suggest multiple interprétations, even when these are contradictory; attempts to find a single important theme or meaning-orientation is abandoned.34 But we are not just talking about a method of reading here. We are concerned about the best method for understanding one of the greats among ancient authors. Is it not precisely the mark of a classic that it is read again and again? Different générations return to this work and find something new in it. We are not exaggerating when we ask: Without Plato, where would philosophy be today? Why would we be debating essentialism, existentialism, or phenomenology? Without Plato, who would be reading Aristotle? Who would have been moved by Socrates' death? Surely no one would be reading Plotinus. 33 In biblical studies rejection of the historical critical method has come hand in hand with critical distantiation from the towering authority of A. Harnack. On post-liberal hermeneutics, connected with theologians like Brevard Childs and George Lindbeck, see my note 6, p.488-9 in Hellenization Revisited. 34 Among more recent discussions of the history of interprétation of the Platonic corpus, however, that of A.C. Bowen, "On Interpreting Plato" in Ch.L. Griswold Jr., ed. Platonic Wrilings, Platonic Readings (New York, London: Routledge, 1988): 49-65, deserves mention for its honest confrontation of the non-systematic, non-dogmatic, dialogic and dramatic character of much of the work of Plato. Bowen, in turn, dépends heavily on the more extensive work of Eugene Tigerstedt, Interpreting Plato (Stockholm,1977), who has also been mentioned favourably by H. J. Kraemer Plato and the Foundations, 223, n.2.</page><page sequence="15">162 WENDY ELGERSMA HELLEMAN In spite of the extensive work on the Pre-Socratics in this century, none of them come anywhere close to Plato in eloquent expression of fundamental philosophical problems. From his remarks to Meijering it is clear that Bos, too, is aware that we read such authors with our own peculiar set of glasses, our apriori, our framework of understanding, our world-view. Of the contemporary authors mentioned by Bos, Doerrie has recognized most clearly that when the early Christians appealed to Plato they were not interested in an objective reading of every facet of his work: they too approached him with their own agenda, most clearly so when arguing with Gnostics, for they explicitly praised Plato for having correct insight—though a pagan—on issues on which their supposedly Christian brothers, the Gnostics, were completely off track. The intent was to put those Gnostics to shame! Philo's case is different. He makes extensive use of Plato, as has been thoroughly demonstrated by D.T. Runia in his discussion of the Timaeus in the Philonic corpus. But is he generally regarded as a Platonist? Far more as an eclectic. Again, he uses Plato when it is convenient for him. Bos himself acknowledges how much 'Plato' changes as he is read by authors through the centuries, how differently Plato looks from the perspective of Plotinus, Greek fathers like Maximus the Confessor, Renaissance Platonists like Ficino, Cambridge Platonists, or German ïdealists. From my own reading of Platonism, particularly in connection with recent work on Vladimir Solovyov's understanding of Sophia and the World-Soul, I would certainly support Bos's comments on the complexities and contra dictions resulting from use of Platonic catégories to interpret the first chapters of Genesis. However, the particular problem on which I have stumbled repeatedly, in dealing with the history of Christian Platonism, is one to which Bos refers only briefly in the analysis of gradations of being.35 It is the problem of relegating that which is imperfect to a structurally lower level of the hierarchy of being (90). Christians who follow Plato closely have great diffïculty positing an originally good création, to be clearly distinguished from that which becomes imperfect and evil as a conséquence of the fall into sin. In fact, as Bos realizes, they often end up accusing the Maker Hunsell as the ultimate origin ot evil; N. Berdyaev is a clear example.36 Nonetheless, I would claim that this problem is not to be traced back to the distinction which Bos took to be most problematic, that between visible and invisible reality as such, between a world of corruptible and one of unchangeable eternal 'being'; after Philo the divine 3·° It is my assumption that the 'scale of being' with its gradations, higher and lower, as such is characteristic not just of Plato, but must be understood in terms of a worlview which characterized many thinkers in antiquity; this assumption is supported by the well known work of Arthur O. Lovejoy The Great Chain of Being (Cambridge Mass.: Harvard UP, 1936/1964. 36 It is of interest that Th.G. Sinnige, in a recent article on C. de Vogel, points precisely to such a need to avoid attributing evil to the Godhead as persuading her, on metaphysical grounds, to affirm the ultimate monism of Plotinus; cf. his "Comelia Johanna de Vogel (1905-1986)" in A History of Women Philosophera, vol. 4, M.E. Waithe ed. (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academie Pub., 1995): 225-242, especially 233.</page><page sequence="16">REA DING PLATO FOR THE 2 1 ST CENTURY 163 ideas were almost invariably 'located' in the divine mind, and after Plotinus most Platonists were monistic in their analysis of the cosmos.37 The question we are dealing with points to a basic duality, that of creational structure and religious direction, distinguishing what was originally good because God created it so, from what is less than perfect because of the effects of sin. In the work of Solovyov the problem arises particularly because of his use of Origen, who accepted a pre-creation fa.ll, and saw embodiment itself as a kind of punishment. Gnosticism shows us an extreme form of this problem; but there are other early Christian writers who had considérable difficulty arriving at a healthy estimation of human sexuality, to give but one example, as did those fathers who considered gender distinctions a resuit of the fall. Among German Idealists the problem arises particularly with those who work out of the perspective of Boehme and Baader. Yet even when they went so far as acceptance of body/soul or spirit/matter dualism, Christians were trying to give expression to a duality which is real, the duality of goodness, to which biblical and creational révélation points us, and of the evil which has resulted from déformation of what was created good, from rejection of the truth. It is my suspicion that Christian consciousness of this duality of paths has been highly significant in the tendency to turn to Plato above all other ancient philosophers. What are the implications for our reading of Plato as an important philosopher? In his focus on Plato's view of intellectuality as the highest of human characteristics, Bos has portrayed Plato by means of one theme that can be found in his work. I would not disagree on the importance of this theme in itself, although I have mentioned my réservations regarding his account of Plato's Ideas (above, section 4). But even granting his analysis of Plato's absolutizing of the logical function, the question still arises, whether this theme exhausts the attention we are to devote to Plato, or even correctly identifies the source of the fascination exercised by the work of Plato through out the centuries. 38 37 As we have seen, Bos realized that Neo-Kantian 'idealism' which regards the Ideas as products of human thought could not do justice to the rôle Plato assigned them as the pre supposition of thought and knowledge (85). But he follows this very path with his argument against 'locating' the Ideas in a transcendent divine realm, for he simply states that such presuppositions for thought must also be situated in human intellectuel capacities for knowing the world of experience (cf. above section 3). 38 There are many ways to approach Plato. The approach focusing on Plato's literary qualities has been given much attention, but should not be neglected, for these too have made him a favourite, not only for the philosophers among lovers of antiquity. Plato's work has a fascinating quality, not just for the well-developed positions associated with his name, the views carefully formulated in later générations. From the perspective of the teacher one can appreciate the dialogic approach, Plato's ability to incorporate the reader in finding solutions. In the dialogues Plato does not provide pre-digested solutions for his readers; the answers to the questions raised are rarely given on the surface of the text. Cf. A.C. Bowen's assessment of the dialogic character of Plato's philosophie text (op.άί., note 34), "Unlike the works of Aristoüe and later philosophers, Plato's text does not require the reader to sit in Plato's school and learn his philosophy; it demands instead that the reader become a philosopher in his own right (62)."</page><page sequence="17">164 WENDY ELGERSMA HELLEMAN Plato was a pagan author. But so were Aristotle and Plotinus; we continue to read them because of the long shadow they have cast on subséquent thinkers, as much as for their well-developed positions on questions which continue to intrigue us. Anti-Christian arguments have not prevented us from reading Kant or Nietzsche. Unlike many of his successors, however, Plato's work gives us not just another philosophy text. In a real sense he stands at the foundation of the whole philosophical enterprise. There are many important themes in his work—not only knowledge and reason, but the soul and eros, or justice in the state, éducation and the libéral arts; if readers do not first understand Plato's élaboration of these, they will face great diffïculty in understanding the later tradition. But if they read critically, appreciating some aspects while dis agreeing with others, are they not, in fact, doing what Christians have done throughout the centuries: combining sélective appréciation with critical rejection? There is much more that could be said on the questions raised by Bos's treatise on Platonism. The question of dualism, for instance, with the cor responding problem of persistent intertwinement of Gnosticism in the history of Christian Platonism, demands far more attention than can be given in this brief review article. With the above I do hope that I have presented sufficiënt material to indicate that there is legitimate reason to take a very different approach to Plato and his considérable role in the history of Christianity, East and West. It remains only to thank Bos for a thought-provoking book. Disagreement does not exclude respect for the position developed. Interacting has given me an opportunity to develop my own thoughts on an important subject. And for that I express my appréciation.</page></plain_text>
