<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Byzantine Solomon Eulogio, Tokens in the British Museum* L.Y. Rahmani Jerusalem In 1973, the British Museum acquired from a London antiquities dealer a group of 80 clay eulogia tokens (henceforth: the BM group), together with the glass dish in which they were reported to have been found.1 The group's provenance remains problematic, as does that of an additional small group of 14 tokens, published by Vikan (henceforth: the V group).2 Most of the types in both groups bear representations of New Testament characters and scenes.3 The most common representation is that of the Adoration of the Magi, with 19 specimens in the BM group and two in the V group. The second largest number of tokens (14 specimens in the BM group and two in the V group) ? and the subject of this discussion ? are the Solomon eulogiai, the only type in the BM and V groups to bear an inscription and to concern an Old Testament character. The Solomon eulogiai are represented by two variants, which differ in their size, the direction of the inscription and their central image. The impression of image and inscription is uneven. All tokens are fashioned of dark brown clay, rather poorly fired. Their slightly convex backs are plain. * Thanks are due to David Buckton (Keeper of the Department of Medieval and Later Antiquities at the British Museum, London), for permission to inspect and study these tokens (BM Reg. Nos. 1973,5-1,57-70), published here by courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum, London. 1 The dish was assigned by Dan Barag to a Syrian workshop of the sixth century C.E., see R.

All faces are badly worn; one is broken, and three show apparently intentional scraping at the edges. The token's face is framed by a slightly raised circle, containing a Greek inscription, which begins at the lower left and is divided at the image's apex. It reads: COAO/MCDN. The image is indistinct in all surviving specimens. In its general outlines it seems to consist of two tubular forms (see Fig. 2b for tentative reconstruction). One stands vertically at the centre, while the other is bent into a U-shape, which lies diagonally across the foot of the vertical tube. There are inverted crescents at the tips of the tubes. Fig. 1.

Ancient written sources point to a similar date, D. Baldi: Enchiridion Locorum Sanctorum, Jerusalem, 1935, pp. 809-810, citing Antoninus Martyr (570 C.E.) and Gregory of Tours (585 C.E.). 7 Metal ampullae might indeed have been manufactured at some workshop in the East, apart from the site indicated by the images represented upon them; a stamp for such manufacture, discovered in Jerusalem, shows the sacrifices of Isaac and of Daniel. The shrines concerned are understood to have been located at Hebron and on the Eleutheropolis-Ascalon road respectively, M. Piccirillo: Uno stampo per eulogia trovato a Gerusalemme, Liber Annuus 44 (1994), pp. 585-590. Jerusalem seems, for the period in question, to be the most likely centre for the manufacture of such metal devotionalia, Engemann (above, n. 6), p. 26 and n. 151; K. Weitzmann: Loca Sancta and the Representational Arts of Palestine, Dumbarton Oaks Papers 28 (1974), p. 55. A. Grabar (Ampoules de la Terre Sainte, Paris, 1958, pp. 47-50) considered Constantinople metal ware to be more likely prototypes, although agreeing (p. 61), as Engemann pointed out (op. cit., p. 24, n. 13), that monumental pictures in the sanctuaries of the Holy Land might have served in this capacity. See, further, Ross (above, n. 6), pp. 71-72; K. Wessel, in Reallexikon zur byzantinischen Kunst, s.v. Ampullen; similarly Rahmani (above, . 6, 1985), p. 180; idem (above, . 3,1993), p. 115. Contemporaneous pilgrim glass vessels also seem to have been manufactured near Jerusalem, Barag (above, n. 6), p. 48. 8 Vikan (above, n. 2), p. 82, n. 113. His claim (p. 72, n. 43) is based on evidence of St. Symeon's Vita, but his quotations refer only to that saint's hair or his clay tokens, mentioned as brought from his sanctuary to Constantinople. Vikan is, of course, correct in his assumption that these devotionalia were manufactured at that saint's shrine, as those of St. Menas are known to have been made at that saint's shrine in Egypt, even when discovered in Antioch, cf. J. Lafontaine-Desogne: Itin?raires arch?ologiques dans la</page><page sequence="5">96 L.Y. RAHMANI Even if one accepts the assumption that a person or persons unknown had collected such a large number of eulogia tokens somewhere in Syria (or even at or near St. Symeon's sanctuary), the purpose of such hoarding must remain unknown.9 It might represent a hoard collected by a pilgrim to take to his homeland for his own use, or for use by his relatives or friends. Like coin hoards, its retention at the place where it was eventually discovered might have been due to its owner's untimely death. No more is known about this than about the reason for the presence of eight Byzantine eulogia tokens at Beth Shean. Some of these, in fact, are similar in all respects to those of the BM and V groups,10 and were surely not manufactured at St. Symeon's sanctuary, where only tokens conveying that saint's 'blessing' would have been required. The argument that some tokens are 'topographically anonymous'11 and thus might not be considered to come from a specific holy place seems unconvincing. While a eulogia showing the Theotokos might indeed come from a number of sanctuaries dedicated to the Virgin Mary, these can be identified.12 This happens also to be the case with the Solomon eulogiai.13 Indeed, 'topographically anonymous' eulogiai (i.e. without a known association to a specific holy place) would have been considered to be of little value by pious pilgrims. Devotional objects14 acquired when visiting the holy places served the pilgrims as authentic mementoes, vividly recapitulating their thrilling moments at the shrines. Tangible blessings of these places and the holy personages there envisaged were conferred by earth or stones collected at the shrines.

Rahmani: A Eulogia Stamp from the Gaza Region, IEJ 20 (1970), p. 108.

The latter, even when prepared out of metal, would contain water from a holy well, or oil that had come from lamps burning at the shrine, or had been brought into physical contact with anything pertaining to the sanctified personage, whether an object or actual remains. For contact with the latter, oil passing through the saint's reliquary, via a funnel at the top and a spout at the base, would be poured into the ampulla. The imprint of the holy image stamped upon ampullae or eulogiai, at times accompanied by an inscription and/or the name of the revered personage, would amplify the efficiency of the blessing. The uses to which such devotionalia might be put were obviously manifold. Mere possession and display would assure pilgrims of safety and of a favourable return journey, and would bestow physical and metaphysical prophylaxis and remedy; these objects were considered a safeguard to the living, and perhaps even to the dead. Fluid thus transported, or clay rubbed or scraped from a token, would obviously be very sparingly used, diluted and applied in need. Pronouncing the formula or the name of the saint would increase the beneficial effect. In all cases, however, the prerequisite for such effectiveness would have to be the user's certainty that he possessed a genuine eulogia, the image and inscription (if present) verifying its authenticity. Clay had to come from the site claimed; using earth from any different place would surely have been considered a fraud. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SOLOMON EULOGIAI The Solomon eulogiai are similar to all contemporaneous eulogiai in material, workmanship and signs of use, and differ only in their image and inscription. The reduction of size and reversal of image and inscription, as found in Variant in comparison to Variant A, is encountered on most types of these eulogiai. It is particularly noticeable on those types which have survived in numerous specimens, representing the Nativity,15 Adoration,16 Baptism17 and Resurrection.18 15 Large variant, diameter c. 16 mm., see Camber (above, n. 1), Nos. 4-6; reduced and abridged, with reversed animals, diameter c. 14 mm., ibid., Nos. 7-8; further reduced and abridged, diameter c. 2.5 mm., ibid., No. 9. 16 Large variant, diameter c. 16 mm., see Camber (above, n. 1), No. 10; large, reversed and blurred image, diameter c. 17 mm., ibid., No. 11; reduced, reversed and abridged, diameter c. 11-12 mm., ibid., Nos. 12-28. 17 Large variant, diameter 16-17 mm., see Camber (above, n. 1), Nos. 30-32, with Baptist on right (Camber, Fig. 5, failed to distinguish this from small variant, Nos. 33-37, diameter 11-12 mm.); Baptist on left (similar to a clumsily executed large variant, diameter 38 mm.!), Rahmani (above, n. 3,1980), p. 109, Fig. 1, PI. 23:4; and Camber, op. cit., No. 29, diameter c. 15 mm. 18 These invariably include images of the tomb, with the angel sitting nearby. An abridged</page><page sequence="7">98 L.Y. RAHMANI Details, even personages of a given scene, are often omitted, or else a less distinct image is shown. Occasionally, however, one may encounter a large and yet indistinct variant, its stamp apparently representing a distorted copy, prepared by a less skilled artisan.19 These, and certainly the smaller tokens, must have been the cheaper ones. One may conclude that Variants A and of the Solomon tokens were intended to carry an identical inscription and image. The image on Variant A should be seen as the original, despite its having been less skilfully executed and less distinct than the image and reversed inscription on the reduced Variant B. Variant A The inscription identifies the personage bestowing the blessing as Solomon.20 The image on this variant has been described as a 'full-faced figure',21 an identification rightly rejected by Camber, who instead tentatively suggested 'a schematic representation of the hill upon which Solomon's temple stood'.22 The author cannot accept this identification, because the image does not look like a hill, nor has he found any other eulogia depicting a topographical feature. Moreover, Camber fails to mention or to illustrate the reversed Variant B. Variant As mentioned above, this smaller version of the Solomon eulogiai is represented in the V group by two specimens; Vikan interprets the image as representing a coiled serpent.23 Although conceding that the serpent might symbolise Evil, he claims that in the present case it is a representation of the Good, referring to the Chnoubis snake, or the snakes of Asklepios and Hygieia, as parallels. type, which appears in the BM group, both in the large variant ? angel on left, diameter c. 16 mm., Camber (above, n. 1), Nos. 49-50 ? and in a reduced and reversed variant ? diameter c. 11 mm., ibid., Nos. 51-53; similarly in the V group, see Vikan (above, n. 2), Fig. 22. Both omit the women; these appear alone, without the angel, on an eulogia token from Beth Shean, see Rahmani (above, n. 3,1993), p. Ill, Token C. 19 E.g., Rahmani (above, n. 3,1979), PL 8 B, C; idem (above, n. 3,1980), p. 109, Fig. 1; idem (above, n. 3,1993), Fig. 8. Careless and unskilled workmanship is also found in eulogia ampullae, showing retrograde and garbled inscriptions, e.g. C. Metzger: Les ampoules ? eulogie du mus?e du Louvre, Paris, 1981, p. 15, Figs. 34, 43, 71. These, as well as the inscription on Variant of the Solomon tokens, are garbled, rather than completely and intentionally inverted, thus excluding any magical intention (for the latter, see J. Naveh: Lamp Inscriptions and Inverted Writing, IEJ 38 [1988], pp. 36-43). 20 Old Testament scenes or personages are only rarely represented on eulogia. See, however, a mould for the manufacture of small ampullae, representing the sacrifice of Isaac and Daniel in the lion's den, Piccirillo (above, n. 7). 21 G.P.

Christianity (like Judaism) viewed the serpent as an incarnation of Evil,24 and it was thus conceived even with most Gnostic groups, except for certain Ophites and Naassenes.25 Solomon, on the other hand, appears as the great and constant champion of Good, in both name and image, actively fighting Evil. In numerous amulets he appears as a rider saint, sometimes explicitly identified in inscriptions, overcoming Evil in the form of a female demon, which often appears together with a snake, a lion, or both; these images are more or less carelessly executed.26 The reverse of such amulets may depict Evil, represented by the Evil Eye, attacked by sharp weapons and ferocious beasts,27 or else represented by a serpent, attacked by a large bird.28 A further variant shows the serpent alone, as Evil, pierced by the rider saint.29 The author agrees with Goodenough30 that both serpent and female demon represent Evil overcome by Solomon. Instead, one looks for an image representing some beneficial object, thought to have been used by Solomon, the wise and powerful king, prophet and one of Jesus' ancestors, occasionally taking the place of Christ.31 Solomon's ring or Solomon's seal might indeed represent such an object.

RAHMANI engraving remains in dispute,32 the power contained in this ring was generally accepted. Josephus, extolling Solomon's wisdom and might, recounts the story of one Elcazar, who cured a man possessed by a demon by pronouncing Solomon's name and putting to the nose of the possessed 'a ring which had under its seal one of the roots prescribed by Solomon', thus forcing the demon to flee.33 Josephus returns to a root of similar potency elsewhere,34 naming it after the place of its growth, baaras.35 Concerning the identity of the plant mentioned in Josephus's first story, polygonatum or elleborum have been suggested, the former because of seal-like scars on the roots or stems of these plants;36 the latter has, in fact, been used in cases of insanity or epilepsy.37 As for the identity of the baaras in Josephus's second story, it is thought to be the mandragoras38 because of its manner of extraction, as described by Josephus. In both cases, he attaches to these roots healing powers for 32 Cf. McCown (above, . 31), pp. 86-87, 111. For details, see K. Preisendanz, in PWRE, Supplement 8 (1956), s.v. Salomon, esp.

For the independent potency of Solomon's name, see Preisendanz (above, n. 32), Cols. 676-677. A root (Hqrin) amulet, put into a ring (or a bracelet) is mentioned for its prophylactic and therapeutic uses in cases of epilepsy in Tosefta, Sabbat 4:9 and BT 61a-b, while PT Sabbat 6 2:8 has 'herbs' fassabim) instead.

As for the shape of these roots, one may probably disregard the imaginary anthropomorphic drawings in ancient manuscripts, from the sixth to the ninth centuries,39 not expecting botanically correct representations.40 One is tempted to view the image on our token (Figs. 2b, 4b) as an attempt to illustrate Dioscurides's description of the mandrake root, as formed of two or three big roots 'wrapped within one another'.41 While some of the ancient writers explicitly mention the therapeutic value of this plant in cases of epilepsy, all mention its sedative and narcotic influence, indeed believed to be active even when only smelled.42 This root, or indeed, the whole plant, may well have been represented as held in the right hand of a man clad in chiton and himation, upon an amulet of green jasper from Tyre, identified by a Greek retrograde inscription as Solomon. The object, twig-like, is forked at its upper end.43 It appears once again, much enlarged, in the right hand of a similarly clad man, who holds a staff or scroll in his left hand, his head encircled by a nimbus, standing at the right and facing a large erect serpent, its fangs wide open. A further amulet, much more primitively executed, shows fewer details; the brandished object looks almond-shaped.44 Goodenough correctly identified the first of these two figures with that on the Tyrian amulet, viewing both as Solomon, on the latter shown fighting Evil in the shape of the serpent.45 One may suggest that he does so with a plant or root, appropriate because of its magical power; in one shape or another it seems intended to represent the mandrake. The manner in which the haloed figure, presumably representing Solomon, is depicted opposing the threatening, open-fanged serpent is reminiscent of the manner in which Nicander of Colophon, the ancient pharmacologist, famous as an expert of animal poisons and antidotes, is shown on a sixth-century Dioscurides manuscript, in a miniature, representing a group of physicians.46 The same picture 39 C.

RAHMANI also depicts a physician, pharmacologist and expert on poisons, Andreas, holding in his right hand a plant or root, forked at its end.47 The parallels to the image on the Solomon tokens, cited by Vikan, seem unconvincing as representing a coiled serpent.48 Of the Schlumberger amulets cited, only No. 3 is similar to our representation. On both this and his No. 2 amulet, the image replaces Christ, victorious over the forces of Evil, who is relegated to the lower register.49 This contains the usual assembly of the forces of Evil: a female demon, a serpent and lion; sometimes an Evil Eye is included.50 Nor can one accept two further examples cited. Of the first, a bronze amulet from Fayum, neither Vikan nor his reference shows an illustration of the relevant reverse, but only a description,51 which accurately corresponds to a representation of a nimbed Solomon, with a central, small nimbed cross above, his outstretched right hand opposing the serpent; the amulet includes the Greek inscription 'Solomon's Seal'.52 The second example53 is a highly stylised version of Theotokos representations, from extremely elaborate to very abridged ones.54 An example from the Hermitage, cited by Vikan,55 was correctly identified by Zalesskaya as Golgotha.56 It may well represent an assimilation of the former image of the Theotokos with 47 Ibid., lower left. 48 Vikan (above, n. 2), p. 82 and n. 112, citing Schlumberger (above, n. 26), p. 76, No. 2 and p. 77, No. 3; the inscription on the first mentions 'Solomon's Seal'. 49 Christ in Glory: Mouterde (above, n. 26), PI. 9, Nos. 55,57; also Bonner (above, n. 26), Fig. 324, here surrounded by symbols of the evangelists. 50 Cf.

Conceivably, the root contained in Solomon's ring might have been taken to represent a symbol of the king.58 The Solomon eulogiai discussed here are dated to between the mid-sixth and the early seventh century, as are all the other tokens of this kind.59 Like all other known clay devotionalia, they originated in a holy place here connected with Solomon: the royal sepulchres, pointed out from early Byzantine times on and at that time identified as situated half a mile from Bethlehem. Itineraries of the period mention the tombs of David and his family there,60 Solomon explicitly being mentioned from the fifth century onwards.61 By the sixth century, one finds two monuments mentioned there, one for David and one for Solomon, the place being identified as the Basilica of St. David.62 As a pilgrim site, it is still mentioned in the seventh and as late as the early eighth century CE.63 As with all other clay eulogiai, the material of which these tokens were prepared had to contain earth or clay from the shrine of the saint whose name appeared upon them. Prepared at or near his shrine, the image stamped upon the tokens would be symbolic of Solomon's power over the demons, exemplified in the 57 This may also have been intended on the reverse of a small rider-saint amulet, in Bonner (above, n. 26), p. 308, No. 326, PL 17.

Its image might well have appeared at or near Solomon's tomb and monument.64 These Solomon eulogiai thus represented to the pilgrims a blessed memento, to serve as a safeguard and remedy. They were helpful against insanity, epilepsy and all other cases of those possessed, as well as in all perils and illness of body and soul.
