<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIOLENCE, NONVIOLENCE, PEACE Monotheistic Violence David Lochhead Vancouver School of Theology While Israel was staying at Shittim, the people began to have sexual relations with the women of Moab. They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. Thus Israel yoked itself to the Baal of Peor, and the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel. The LORD said to Moses, "Take all the chiefs of the people, and impale them in the sun before the LORD, in order that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel." And Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Each of you shall kill any of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor." (Num. 25:1-5) This is the first of two stories told in Numbers 25. In the second, an Israelite brings a Midianite woman into the camp as the sentence is being carried out. In response, one of the Israelites, a man named Phinehas, a grandson of Aaron the priest, takes a spear and follows the couple into a tent, where he slaughters them both. God com- mends this act of butchery with these words: "Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the Israelites by manifesting such zeal among them on my behalf that in my jealousy I did not consume the Israelites. Therefore say, 'I hereby grant him my covenant of peace. It shall be for him and for his descendants after him a covenant of perpetual priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the Israelites."' (Num. 25:11-13) The account of these incidents is an unsophisticated one. God is portrayed, in an anthropomorphic way, as violently egocentric. The punishment exacted for offend- ing God is crude and barbaric. This is a god who demands violence and commends violence when it is performed in his cause. This is a god who is intensely competi- tive toward the other gods and who treats vindictively anyone who has commerce with them. Because of the unsophisticated terms in which this story is told, it is easy enough to dismiss a text like this as a crude expression of ancient Hebrew religion that the Judeo-Christian tradition has long since transcended. I want to take a somewhat dif- ferent perspective and argue that the violence expressed in this text, albeit in a more subtle and spiritualized way, has persisted in the Christian tradition. The violence of Numbers 25 has the following characteristics. First, it is ordered Buddhist-Christian Studies 21 (2001). ? by University of Hawai'i Press. All rights reserved.</page><page sequence="2">DAVID LOCHHEAD and justified in terms of an exclusive loyalty to a single deity. Secondly, it expresses a religious xenophobia. This xenophobia is religious, cultural, and sexual. The trans- gression of the loyalty to God is attributed to the presence of foreign women. In short, the text is chauvinist and misogynist. It is common to distinguish between henotheism and monotheism. Henotheism is the worship of a single god in distinction from other gods. Henotheism does not deny the existence of other gods. It focuses its attention and devotion on only one of those gods. Thus henotheism might also be described as monolatry-the worship of one god among many. Monotheism, by contrast, acknowledges the existence of only one god. Given this contrast, we can say that Numbers 25 is a henotheistic text. That is, Yahweh, the god who leads the Israelites out of Egypt and toward the Promised Land, acknowledges the reality of the other god-here the Baal of Peor--by the intensity of his anger. The worship of the Moabites is taken very seriously. Those who partic- ipate in the Moabite cult actually yoke themselves to this other god. The coincidence of the sexual liaison with Moabite women and the worship of the Moabite god expresses something of the intimacy of the relationship in which the Israelite men are understood to participate. It is the assumed reality of the Moabite deity that makes it necessary for Yahweh to demand that the offenders be impaled in the glaring light of the desert sun. By their deaths, this contamination is removed from the chosen nation. The covenant between Israel and Yahweh is restored by this mass execution. As we follow the story of Israel and Judah up to the exile, we find this story repeated again and again. Yahweh orders the slaughter of the Canaanites as the land is conquered. The prophets call for the destruction of the Canaanite cults. The vio- lence of the story of the Baal of Peor is repeated in the story of Elijah's confronta- tion with the priests of Baal on Mount Carmel. (1 Kings 18:20-40) Elijah's demon- stration of the superiority of Yahweh is followed by the mass slaughter of the priests of Baal. The Deuteronomic histories chronicle again and again how the fortunes of Israel depended on the suppression, characteristically violent, of the cults of other gods. With the defeat of Judah by the Babylonians and the exile of its ruling class to Babylon in the sixth century B.C.E., the transition from henotheism to monotheism can be detected. Instead of seeing other gods as competitors to Yahweh, Yahweh is acknowledged as the only God. The worship of other gods comes to be described as no more than bowing before dumb idols. The "other gods" of henotheism do not just disappear, however, with the transi- tion to monotheism. Although the ontology of the gods has been amended, the logic remains henotheistic. The foreign gods are demoted in canonical texts to the status of demons. Thus in Jewish and Christian texts dating from the end of the exile through the fourth century C.E., and including the New Testament canon, one finds an ambivalent attitude to pagan worship. On the one hand, pagan worship is sati- rized as bowing down to "dumb idols," the mere artifacts of the idol makers' craft. But beside this reductio ad absurdum of pagan worship, there exists a real fear that behind the idolatrous object lurks a spiritual reality, a real demonic presence. The idols become the tools through which demonic powers control the lives of idol wor- 4</page><page sequence="3">MONOTHEISTIC VIOLENCE shipers. In other words, idols persist not as representing real gods but as the media of beings, demons, who would usurp the authority of the only legitimate deity. With the decline of paganism in the late Roman Empire, the violence of Chris- tian monotheism begins to be directed not toward the cults of "other gods" of pagan- ism but to Christian heresy, the new front line of Christian spiritual warfare. The monotheistic intolerance of religious diversity and its attended xenophobia is directed toward other Christians. This monotheistic violence can be traced through the per- secution of witches in the late medieval and early modern periods and in the religious violence of Reformation and post-Reformation Europe. Regina Schwartz has made the case against monotheism in her book The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy ofMonotheism. Schwartz relates monotheism to the prob- lem of the formation of collective identity. To have a special god, in Schwartz's analysis, is inseparable from considering oneself as belonging to a special people. This formation of collective identity, Schwartz claims, is intrinsically an act of vio- lence: "Imagining identity as an act of distinguishing and separating from others, of boundary making and line drawing, is the most frequent and fundamental act of violence we commit. Violence is not only what we do to the Other. It is prior to that. Violence is the very construction of the other." In the Bible, Schwartz argues, monotheism and the collective identity of Israel are closely related. She explores the question of collective identity through the themes of covenant, land, kinship, and nationality. The exclusive and excluding relationship of Yahweh to Israel establishes Israel as a unique people, having an exclusive relation- ship with God that is guaranteed by their possession of a promised land, by laws pre- venting exogamy, and by a unique national identity. Schwartz is not attempting to indict the biblical text itself. In her reading, the violent reading of their history is the product of the imagination of Jews living as a vanquished people in exile. It is not the product of a community that is in a position to transform its imagined violence into physical violence. Schwartz, rather, is indict- ing the reading of the Bible that has allowed those who possessed real power, namely the rulers of Christendom, to legitimate their violence in the name of God. This legit- imation is transferred, somewhat secularized, to modern Western nationalism: "A text that had once posited collective identity as the fiat of God ('I will be your God if you will be my people.') came to posit collective identity as the fiat of the nation authorized by God ('one nation, under God'). Nationalism has stubbornly held fast to this legitimation by transcendence. Nations are the will of God. National borders are the will of God. National expansions and colonization are the will of God. National military confrontations are the will of God."2 Schwartz's argument stresses literary analysis and social psychology but does not attempt any concrete political critique. Thus she does not pursue questions of how monotheism contributes to the Christian violence of Northern Ireland, to the terror- ism of Islamic fundamentalism, to the ethnoreligious rivalries of the former Yugosla- via, nor to the violent policies of the State of Israel against Palestinians. Nevertheless it is clear that the themes explored by Schwartz in her analysis of biblical monothe- ism are active in all of these contemporary contexts. If the legitimation of violence is the weakness of monotheism, a concern for jus- 5</page><page sequence="4">DAVID LOCHHEAD tice is its strength. A recent publication of the Concilium series Religion as a Source of Violence? has addressed the question of the relation of violence to religion. While other contributors to the volume explore the origins of violence in religion, Jon Sobrino, speaking from a Central American context, takes a different approach. Sobrino argues that in his context, violence has its origin not in religion but in the injustice that is intrinsic to capitalism. In this context, Sobrino argues, the religious response of liberation theology has been to oppose capitalism. Sobrino refuses an absolute prohibition of violence when it comes to the fight against injustice. The aim of Christian action, he argues, can only be to root out the social origins of violence, which in Latin America is identified as capitalist exploitation. There are three points in Sobrino's paper that deserve closer analysis as they relate to our exploration of monotheistic violence. These three points concern, first, an emphasis on idolatry in Latin American liberation theology; second, the consequent oppositional stance of liberation theology; and finally, Sobrino's identification of capitalism and neoliberalism as the origin of violence in the Latin American context. First, then, the status of idolatry in liberation theology: following Juan Luis Segundo, Sobrino asserts that the fundamental problem for theology is not whether God, as an ultimate being, exists but "whether ultimate realities exist that are in mutually exclusive and antagonistic relationship."3 Sobrino argues that idolatry cannot be understood as something obsolete, some- thing that faded away with the decline of paganism in the ancient world. The idols, he insists, must be understood politically and economically and not just as cultic objects. The idols, he suggests, are the realities that "configure society" and that have life and death power over the members of society. "These realities are named idols in the strict sense because they present themselves with the characteristics of divinity: ultimateness (one cannot go beyond them), self-justification (they do not need to justify themselves to human beings), untouchability (they cannot be questioned and those who do so are destroyed)."4 Second, because theology is concerned with the "exclusive and antagonistic rela- tionship" between God and the idols, liberation theology "insists on the exclusive and oppositional structure of reality." The God of life and the idols of death co-exist in history. There also co-exist mediations of the will of God corresponding to these divinities: the kingdom of God and the anti-kingdom (societies that lead to death: the pax Romana, and a group based around the Temple, in Jesus' time). Mediators also co-exist: Jesus on the one hand, and the high priests, Pilate and his like, on the other. Now these two series of realities exist in a way that is mutually exclusive and also oppositional; that is, they are by their nature at odds with one another. The and therefore, and by its nature, becomes against. 5 Third, in Sobrino, the origin of violence in Latin America is not to be traced, as it might in Bosnia or Sri Lanka or Northern Ireland, to religion. In Latin America, violence must be traced to the institutional structures that produce injustice, namely capitalism and neoliberalism.</page><page sequence="5">MONOTHEISTIC VIOLENCE Sobrino's distinction between the situation in Latin America and the situations in those places where violence is explicitly related to religious conflict can be granted only up to a point. That point comes when we recognize that the conflict between liberation theology and capitalism is, in Sobrino's own terms, a religious conflict. In other words, Sobrino's argument depends on our ability to recognize the religious or quasi-religious character of capitalism and its ideology. "These idols demand a cult (the cruel practices of both capitalism and the 'real socialism' of the past), and they also demand an orthodoxy (the accompanying ideologies); they promise salvation to those who adore them (assimilating them to the wealthy and powerful of the First World), but de-humanize them, 'de-Latin Americanize' them and de-fraternize them ." 6 The struggle in Central America has always been a religious struggle. In the first place, the violent response to liberation movements has been carried on with the explicit support of conservative Christian groups, both Catholic and Protestant. Any- one watching Pat Robertson's 700 Club during the mid-eighties when rebels and the Sandinista government warred for the control of Nicaragua will be aware of how thoroughly the conflict was interpreted in religious terms. But from Robertson's per- spective, God was clearly on the side of the capitalist "freedom fighters" (known in less conservative circles as "contras"). Second, in addition to Sobrino's tacit admission of the religiosity of capitalism by naming it as an idol, we need to take cognizance of the fact that capitalism has emerged as a historical development of the Christian West. That is, in its privileging of "the invisible hand of the market," capitalism reduplicates, in a hidden and secu- larized way, the henotheistic logic of monotheism. In its insistence that the market is a jealous god, tolerating no interference by government regulation, capitalism retains the characteristics of monotheism and its "exclusive and antagonistic relationship" to other values. Sobrino's affirmation of the oppositional nature of Christian faith and its exclusive attachment to God brings out the dilemma faced by monotheism. On the one hand, Christian faith can and must identify the idols of death. A genial polytheism that acknowledges the equal validity of all values must, in the end, undercut the historic commitment of the monotheistic traditions to justice. Thus even those who take a pluralistic position on questions of interfaith relationships do so in the name of a set of values-peace, justice, ecological well-being-that are held to be common to all religious traditions. This move effectively posits a new monotheism defined indepen- dently of any particular religious tradition. In naming the values that are not of God, even if this naming is accomplished by their omission from the list of "common" val- ues, it is implied that at some level the "exclusive and antagonistic" character of monotheism must be retained. A commitment to justice involves opposition to those who are not just. The dilemma of monotheism lies in the problem of who gets to name "the idols of death." Again, taking Central America as the paradigm, the right-wing ideology that sanctioned death squads did so by demonizing the opposition to capitalist exploitation as opposition to God. For the Christian Right, the violence of the Nica- 7</page><page sequence="6">DAVID LOCHHEAD raguan "freedom fighters" (aka "contras"), was baptized as a struggle against atheism and tyranny. Monotheistic violence, then, is rooted in the "exclusive and oppositional" charac- ter of the First Commandment: "You shall have no other gods before me." That is not to say that monotheism is always violent. It is to say, rather, that the First Com- mandment is always available to monotheists to legitimize their opposition to ene- mies, even when that opposition takes a violent form. Given the oppositional character of monotheism, the themes of nonviolence, rec- onciliation, and peace, which are clearly present in the Christian tradition, seem somewhat paradoxical. How, we ask, can a monotheistic tradition like Christianity be a resource for peace in the contemporary world? Is there a reading of the Judeo- Christian tradition that would leave us a different message? Rene Girard has made a contribution to addressing this question through his stud- ies of mimetic desire, sacrifice, and myth. According to Girard, biblical religion, far from creating violence, is unique among religion in exposing the victimization inher- ent in social violence. Girard's view of the relationship of violence and religion was first elaborated in his 1973 book Violence and the Sacred. This work is, in effect, an indictment of religion for its role in legitimating and giving ritual expression to the violence that is intrinsic to the maintenance of social order. While this work exam- ines closely the concept of sacrifice and its connection to myth and ritual, Girard is silent on the role of sacrifice in the Bible. There is no mention here of the figure of Christ as sacrificial victim. This silence is significant, as becomes clear in Girard's later works. Girard believes that far from repeating the sacrificial motif in myth and ritual, the Bible unmasks the religious sanction given to sacrifice and victimization. The Bible, not exclusively but especially in the death of Christ, exposes and indicts the social violence expressed and enacted in the myth and ritual of sacrifice. For Girard, social cohesion involves the working of what he calls "mimetic desire." Simply put, Girard is suggesting that we learn to desire and we learn what to desire by imitation. Imitating the desires of others generates common social values. But when many people share the same object of desire, the attempt to obtain this desire leads to rivalry and therefore to violence. Mimetic desire leads to rivalry and there- fore to an increase in the pressure within society to have recourse to violence. It is here that religion enters the picture. For Girard, mimetic desire and its atten- dant rivalry operates at a more or less unconscious level. The pressure it generates is nonetheless real. Religion allows the releasing of this pressure through the myth and ritual of sacrifice. Violence is ritually expressed by the killing of a sacrificial victim. In order for this religious purging of the social pressure to violence to work, Girard maintains, it must remain at the unconscious level. That is, in the offering of a vic- tim through sacrifice, the community must believe that the violence is demanded by the sacred and that the victim is really deserving of death; the community is not con- scious of scapegoating. The fact of scapegoating can only be recognized by an exter- nal observer, one not caught up in the mimetic desire and rivalry of the community. Girard, however, is a Christian. For Girard, Christ's death is not sacrificial in that God does not command it. Girard rejects any view of the death of Christ that would 8</page><page sequence="7">MONOTHEISTIC VIOLENCE make Jesus, as some feminist writers have put it, the victim of divine child abuse. Rather, in the crucifixion of Jesus, the reverse happens. In the crucifixion it is revealed that the source of violence is not God, not the sacred, but the community itself. In the crucifixion, God is revealed not as the source of violence but as the scapegoat, the victim. This pattern of the unmasking of violence by taking the perspective of the scape- goat, the victim, is a pattern that Girard finds not only in the death of Jesus but throughout the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. In stories like the murder of Abel or of the selling of Joseph by his brothers, Girard argues that the scapegoating myths that justify religious violence are reversed. The biblical perspective, which is the per- spective of the scapegoat, unmasks violence and vindicates the victim.7 We may object that Girard overlooks the other side of the story. Indeed, the story that opened our exploration, the story of the Baal of Peor, does not reveal the pattern that Girard identifies in the Bible. Here, scapegoating is not unmasked. The passage falls into the pattern that Girard identifies with myth; namely, the victimization of scapegoats, those who are singled out to bear the force of the violence of the com- munity, who are subjected to violence, as it is claimed, at the command of God. If we place the analyses of Regina Schwartz and Rene Girard side by side, we per- ceive this tension that runs through the Christian tradition. On one hand, it is clear that monotheism can generate and legitimate violence. On the other hand, Jesus Christ stands for Christians as the incarnation of God's love, not as victimizer but as the divine victim of human violence. The coexistence of these two threads has made it possible for both holy wars and pacifist movements to find their foundation in the scriptures and in Christian history. Monotheism places the claims of God over against the claims of any possible pre- tenders to God's place. This has permitted a pattern of justifying violence by Chris- tians, through the claim that God's enemies are my enemies, that God's holiness may be vindicated by violent means. The question, however, is whether God has enemies. Monotheism, if it is to be taken seriously, requires an answer to the question of the character of the One who, it is claimed, is God. Without this answer, God functions as a kind of a screen on which we can project any and every social and cultural value. Without this answer, violence is permitted, because in the last analysis, God has ene- mies-namely, my enemies. God becomes the guarantor of social values and per- mits a society to practice violence in God's name. Does God have enemies? If God is love, as the Gospel claims, then we must answer this question negatively. There may be those, indeed, who resist love. There may be those who sin against love. There may be those who pervert love. But to be in enmity against love, against God, is not to be the enemy of God. For love is not optional for God. Love is not something God chooses to do or not to do. Love is what God is. God is love. I may make God my enemy, but I cannot make myself into the enemy of God. And if I cannot make myself the enemy of God, it must follow as well that I cannot portray others as God's enemies. We can put this conclusion another way. For Christians, there are two great com- mandments. One commandment requires that we love God-a love that encom-</page><page sequence="8">DAVID LOCHHEAD passes all our hearts, minds, and spirits. The other commandment requires that we love our neighbors. Our neighbors, we are reminded by Jesus, include our enemies. The unconditional love of God and the unconditional love of the enemy/neigh- bor stand side by side. We are accustomed to prioritizing these commandments, by calling the love we are to have for God "the First Commandment," and the love we are to have for neighbor is "Second." This prioritizing has the effect of suggesting that the Second Commandment, to love our neighbors, is somehow optional, something that "comes after" our duty to love God. If we get stuck on the First Commandment we may, as we have seen, never reach the Second. If God is love, however, this sep- aration of the commandments cannot be allowed to stand. The God who commands our sole loyalty is none other than love itself. In other words, one cannot love God apart from loving one's enemy/neighbor. To love God without loving one's enemy is to love a false God. The First Commandment cannot be fulfilled apart from the ful- fillment of the Second. God's identity is tied inseparably to the love of enemy/neigh- bor. The commandment to love, we must insist, is one. The love for God and love for neighbor/enemy are united in the identity of God as love. For the Christian, reality is relational. The commandment to love God and to love the neighbor/enemy involves the assumption that the beloved is other than self, that we are bound to the other by the commandment to love. That is to say, to the monotheist, God is Other. In the terms of Martin Buber, God is Thou-"the Thou which by its very nature cannot become It." To say that God is love is not, for the Christian believer, the reduction of God to a platonic universal. It is to say that God is "Other" in and through the relationship of love. We are bound to God in and through the love of the neighbor/enemy. Again Buber articulates the connection: "Every particular Thou is a glimpse through to the eternal Thou."8 Regina Schwartz, we recall, sees the construction of the other as an act of violence. Perhaps we should say that the violence belongs to the construction of the other as "outsider." In Christian faith, however, we stand under the command to construct the other, be it the other God or the neighbor/enemy, as beloved. The beloved is never outsider. To construct the other as outsider is forbidden to the Christian inso- far as it transgresses on the commandment to love. That, however, does not remove us from the problem of violence. As Sobrino reminds us, the affirmation of God as love involves us in conflict with all that sub- verts love and justice. The tension for the Christian between love and conflict is addressed in the Epistle to the Ephesians: "For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places." (Eph. 6:12) For us, the "spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" are those forces that per- sistently construct the other as outsider. This construction is violence and the ground of violence. To refuse this violence is to make oneself vulnerable to the subversion of the law of love. To refuse this violence is to make oneself vulnerable to violence. Thus Sobrino, insisting on the conflictual relationship of Christian faith with the idolatry of capitalism in Central America, concludes his essay with a discussion of martyrdom, 10</page><page sequence="9">MONOTHEISTIC VIOLENCE with special reference to those Christians in his context who have fallen victim to cap- italist-inspired violence. God's identification with humanity in Jesus Christ, God's love, is manifest particularly, to use Rene Girard's language, in God becoming victim to the scapegoating violence of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It is not uncommon, then, that those who oppose violence can only do so by becoming its victim. The construction of the other as outsider, and therefore as somehow exempt from the commandment to love, is commonplace. Whether it is in the militant nation- alisms that have torn apart the former Yugoslavia, in religious chauvinism in India, in the Israeli treatment of Palestinians, or even in the western demonization of Saddam Hussein, we can see how this construction of the alien suspends the law of love and legitimizes violence. We may be tempted to deal with this process by trying to abolish difference. For it is difference-religious difference, national difference, linguistic difference, eco- nomic difference, sexual difference-upon which the construction of the other as outsider is based. Yet in the end this movement to abolish difference becomes another act of violence. For when the other insists on difference, when the other refuses our unilateral construction of a universal or essential character that all are expected to share, we have little option but to deal with the other as an outsider to our version of peace, harmony, and goodwill.9 To construct the other as beloved, by contrast, involves the love of difference. It calls not for the abolition of difference but for the deconstruction of the other as out- sider. That is to say, the sin against love is not the recognition of difference. On the contrary, the honoring of difference is an aspect of love. The sin against love happens when difference becomes the pretext for exclusion. The sin against love happens when difference legitimizes violence, of whatever kind. We need to attend to how the other is demonized, with how the other is objectified in ways that seem to release us from the commandment to love. There are those, of course, who offend against love. It may be easier to see this in others than in ourselves. As long as the attack on love persists, then Christian faith will necessarily be conflictual. The attack on love may take the form of propaganda, of economic exclusion, of law, of ideology, of repression. It may also take the form of theology. When love is attacked we are dealing with violence, no matter how benign or "theoretical" that attack may seem. To decline violence, paradoxically, is inevitably conflictual, as conscientious objectors in our various wars have invariably discovered. In declining violence we do not escape it. At best we assume a new relationship to it. In this context of conflict, the law of love may express itself as the demand for jus- tice. However close we come to loving our enemies (which most of the time is not very close), we cannot stop our neighbor/enemies from constructing outsiders and using the tools of ideology, propaganda, law, economics, as well as physical force, to penalize them. In that context, any resistance will have to use some of these same tools. They are all we have. Resistance to dehumanization is what justice demands. In resisting, we must find ways to use these tools in less violent ways. For that is what love demands. 11</page><page sequence="10">DAVID LOCHHEAD NOTES This paper was written for the Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter. I have attempted to present a critical Christian perspective on issues of violence without explicitly raising ques- tions about the relationship of this perspective to Buddhism. That, I expect, is the task of my respondents. The paper is written, nevertheless, in the consciousness that its primary audience is equally divided between Christian and Buddhist readers. In that respect, it is perhaps impor- tant to say that I have deliberately avoided any attempt to mitigate what in Buddhist eyes may seem an unacceptable dualism in Christian thought. 1.
