<plain_text><page sequence="1">A STUDY OF CULT IMAGES OF KONKAN : TRADITIONS, RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND ICONOGRAPHY SHILPA HADAP and P.P. JOGLEKAR Introduction The Konkan region of Mahārāshtra on the west coast of India is a small strip of land between the Western Ghāts and the Arabian Sea. Goa is part of Konkan and Konkani culture. Four districts in Mahārāshtra included in the Konkan region are Thāne, Rāigad, Ratnāgiri and Sindhudurg. The main purpose of this work is to document the myths, legends, traditions and religious beliefs at a local level and understand the process of integration of the local deities with the mainstream Hindu gods and goddesses. The process of assimilation of village/local deities into mainstream religion is a long process and influenced by several complex social-historical and cultural factors. The myths and stories that surround a deity in a particular region (e.g. Konkan) are often evolving and changing through time. Many of the iconic forms of a village/local deity that we see today, may be in accordance with the established view of a particular Hindu god or goddess. However, the legends and stories known to people may give us a clue to the origin and development of that particular deity. Such information would obviously missed by just looking at the deity from iconographie perspective. Hence, in a larger frame of investigation it is intended to view the deity as not a static entity, but a result of dynamic interplay of various culture-historical factors and process underneath the worship. This paper presents preliminary findings of the work done on the cult images found in two talukas of District Ratnāgiri, Maharashtra. The aim of this paper is to describe the locations, nature of worship (at present) and features of a few village/local deities and their iconographie features. At a later stage such information would be used in association with other kind of evidence (both textual and oral) to obtain a comprehensive picture of changing perspectives of cult icons (in Konkan) in relation to the communities that worship them. Defining the Cult Images The word cult expresses the system of religious devotion directed towards a particular figure or object by a group of people who share religious or spiritual beliefs, especially those regarded by others as misguided, unorthodox, extremist, or false. A system of religious or spiritual beliefs is informal and often transient and could be directed by a charismatic, authoritarian leader (Microsoft Encarta Dictionary). The word image, derived from the 12th century Latin word 'Imago' means likeness. In this study the focus is on sculptures, icons, and objects. In short, the word 'cult image' in this study refers to cult icons. Such icons may be in</page><page sequence="2">216 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, or amorphous in visual form. Many folk deities whose antiquity is far more than the Vedic deities are still worshipped in Konkan and are more popular than the common deities such as Siva and Viļņu. Many Linga stones and Yonipithas are scattered in several villages of Konkan. The Yak§a pujā still exists in Konkan. Now people worship these deities in varied styles. They perform the rituals differently, but the core of the worship is still the same. This tradition descends from generation to generation and people still believe in the age-old concepts. The flow of the culture is floating uninterruptedly since an ancient time with various innovations. Cult images of the Konkan are be a part of this culture. This study will present a picture of several important aspects of the folk culture of the Konkani people. In ancient times fertility was the most important aspect of life. Therefore, the Linga pujā and Yoni pujā became important rituals in culture. The tradition of this worship still exists in the minds of people. In some cases, Hindus and Muslims have the same rituals. Both communities perform same rituals and at times worship the same local deity e.g. in Karde, a village in Ratnāgiri district villagers perform a ritual of Kātkhel in Šimgā. At that time, Muslim people participate in Hindu rituals. It is a custom that Hindus should let the Muslims perform the ritual first. The palanquin of Khem is taken first to the tomb/mosque and then to Khem temple. Muslim villagers are given the first place of honour by Hindu devotees in this ritual. Historical Background of the Study Narren (1894) has written the history of Konkan in Gazetteer of then Bombay territory during the British Rāj, (Kamble, 2003). In this gazetteer, he gave all kinds of information about the people of Konkan. According to him they worship deities protecting them from diseases, ghosts, spirits, animals, etc. Enthoven (1915) in his monumental work has documented worship of the local deities and rituals of the Konkan. He has classified the deities as nature's powers, hero gods, disease deities, ancestors and saints worship, malevolent dead, evil eye and scary ghosts, animal worship, totemic and fetishism, etc. In 'Devïko§', Prabhudesai (1968) discusses about female deities and mother goddesses from India. He has mentioned the names of approximately 130 deities from Ratnāgiri district. Kunte (2007) collected information about the unique and famous deities from Konkan. For example, the image of the Yaksha with 18 heads and 36 hands from Kudal, Ravalnath with four hands from Kudal (Sindhudurga district). Ghanekar (2006) has written a book 'Konkanâtïla ParyaÇan', in which the focus is on the information for the tourists. He has specifically given information about famous temples and the deities in Ratnāgiri and Sindhudurga districts.</page><page sequence="3">Cult Images ofKonkan through Traditions , Religious Beliefs and Iconography 217 Preliminary Findings Explorations done so far in Ratnāgiri district (Fig. 1) revealed worship of various deities at five places in Rajapur taluka and twelve places in Dapoli taluka. These have been classified (Fig. 2) and a few important ones have been described below. Male Deities of Taluka Rajapur, District Ratnāgiri (1) Gängeswara Navanāth Kālīkā Devī temple at Tervan has eight deities in its garbhagruha, installed on a plinth. The maņdap of temple is very simple. Some idols from this temple are new, replaced by the copy of original idol, after breakage of the original one. Kālīkā is the main deity of the shrine, and other deities are known as Gängeswara Navanāth, Vīthalā Devi, Navalā Devī, Jūgā Devi, Pavanā Devī, Akālī Brāhman, and Pāšāņa (Pancadevatā). These deities are worshipped by Kuņbi Samāj. What people call Gängeswara Navanāth or Gāngogatabha is basically a stone (Satīšlā) having depiction of hand, the Sun and the Moon on its upper part. The remaining area is divided into three parts. On each part, three human figures are depicted - two women and one man. In the first part, all the three figures are in namskār mudrā. In the second part, a man is shown putting his hands on the shoulders of the two women. In the third part the three figures are sitting on a platform. The man holds a sword in his hand. One woman is in namskāra mudrā. The other woman is a seated figure. It is possible that, because of the Fig. 1 :MapoftheStudy Area-RatnagiriDistrict Fig. 2: Classification scheme of deities group of nine figures, it is called 'Navanāth'. Second stone is also a 'Satīšlā'. A feminine hand is depicted on this stone. Three women Cult Images I ' ""H Cult Images Cult Images i ' Cult Images Cult Images</page><page sequence="4">218 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) figures are shown as sitting in cross-legged fashion are are in namskāra mudrā. (2) Brāhman Dev This is depicted as two Šivalingas. The deity, in another temple situated in the heart of Tervan village is known as Gāgodeva. Also, other deities called, Gāgo Mhârkyâ, Rāk§ak, Mhāpuru§, Gāgo Vithalāī, Šipāī, Gāgobā, are installed on the plinth in this small temple. Gāgo Mhârkyâ is an abstract ( Avyakta ) deity and local people call it Gāgo Mhârkyâ. This stone does not have any particular shape. (3) Chavhātā / Munjā At Adivare, village in Ratnāgiri district people believe that, there are two kinds of Bhūts (ghosts) malignant and friendly. Munjā is a malignant spirit in Konkan. It is believed that when a boy, dies without undergoing the sacred thread ceremony (an initiation rite), turns into a Munjā. (4) Linga This linga is not a symbolic shape, but an actual depiction of a human phallus. This linga is found in a recess of the rampart of Mahākālī temple at Adivare. Now people do not worship the linga in its original form, but worship their symbolic substitutes. In ancient times, Šivalingas were depicted as a perfect copy of the human phallus, after erection (Fig. 3). Then later, this form was converted, first in to a beautiful pillar and still later into a square, polygonal or cylindrical pillar. Thus, Fig. 3: Linga of Adivare it became a totally different form from the original form of the human phallus. All these changes took a long time (from the 2nd century B.C. to the 12th century. A.D.) (Joshi 1979: 134). Probably, the date of Adivare Šivalinga may go back to at least 12th century A.D. or it may be a later version of the ancient tradition, and an example of continuity of tradition. (5) Ravaļnāth This deity is housed in a separate temple in the Mahākālī temple complex in Adivare village. There are five deities in this temple complex and Ravaļnāth is one of them.</page><page sequence="5">Cult Images of Konkan through Traditions, Religious Beliefs and Iconography 219 (6) Nagarešwara Nagarešwara is a village deity of Adivare. In this Siva temple, there is very big ant-hill. Now this ant-hill has grown to a height of more than that of the temple roof. Villagers believe that, during the monsoon season, not a single drop of water goes inside this ant-hill. To them this seems to be is an important aspect of the power of Nagarešwara (7) Mānkarī Five stones are combined into a deity called Mānkarī at Kasheli village. Villagers believe that they are five recipients of honour. They choose five gods from a total of twelve villages. It means that they are five recipient of honour from twelve villages. (8) Bhūt The bodyguard / security guards of Jākādevī of Kasheli village are depicted in the form of stones as symbol of ghosts. (9) Kanakâdîtya This is the deity of the ancient Sun temple of Kasheli (about 800 years old). The story about this temple as told by villagers is that there is an ancient Sun temple in Prabhas- Pattan near Veraval in Gujarat. In that temple there were twelve icons of Surya seated on different thrones. In A.D. 1293 Allauddin Khilji attacked Saurā§tra. At that time, a trader of Veraval took some icons of Surya, put them in his boat, and came to the South. When he reached Kasheli, he had a divine vision, and as directed by the god, he dropped one icon in the sea. The icon landed in a cave near the sea. In Kasheli, there was one female devotee of Surya named Kanakā, who had a divine vision. With the help of villagers she took that icon from that cave and built a temple. Because of that devotee, this deity is known as 'Kanakâdîtya'. (10) Devnāgre This deity at Devlhansol village in Ratnāgiri district is worshiped by the Kuņbī Samaj. There is an oval-shaped stone, fixed in a small recess and above that stone, at the head of the recess, figure of a plough is depicted. Villagers called it Devnāgre (Fig. 4). 'Nāgre' is a corrupt version of the word 'Nãngara', which means plough. It is very interesting that plough, the implement used for obtaining food (crops) has been symbolised as a deity. Fig. 4: Dernagare at Devīhansol</page><page sequence="6">220 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) Male Deities of Taluka Dapoli, District Ratnāgiri (a) Bhairavanāth Bhairavanāth is an important deity of village Murud. Villagers ask for an oracle {Kaul) from this deity. For that, they use only the flowers/ buds of a tree named as 'Devhārī'. This ritual is done on 'Šimagā'. On Nāralī Paurnīmā, before Gokul A§tamī, the villagers dance in front of this deity. At that time, they sing a song - 'Sābole Dādā' . Only the Marāthā Kuņbī and Bahujan Samāj worship this deity. Villagers ask for oracle from 'Devāchā Tandalā' twice in a year. There are two wives of the Bhairavanāth. One is Jogešwan and the other is Kâleswarï. Fig. 5: Bhairvnath The icon of Bhairavanāth has four hands. He rides a horse. He holds sword and shield in his two hands. In the upper right hand, he holds something resembling a Damaru a snake is depicted on the right shoulder. In the upper left hand he holds a spear. He wears some ornaments like necklace and bracelets. Decorative curlicues come out from his crown (Fig. 5), there is a myth related to this deity that, his first wife Kâleswarï was annoyed. She went to live in'Khotāchī Vādī' (meaning a Brahmin's colony). Until recently a time Khot of the village was a very powerful man and virtual master of the village. He could do any thing he wished. This myth probably shows traces of some relationship between the Brāhmīn's and other communities. (b) Vyâghreswara (Vāghobā) The temple of Vyâghreswara at Asud is approximately 800 years old. It is said that, in ancient times, many tigers lived in this area, and so, people called this deity 'Vyâghreswara'. Earlier the deity was called as Vāghobā and then the name was converted into Vyâghreswara clearly indicating an attempt to uplift the status to an ancient local deity. Vyâghreswara means god Siva as the controller of tigers and is depicted as Šivalinga. (c) Kālbhairava Kālbhairava is another very important deity at Asud, district Ratnāgiri. He is depicted as riding on a horse. The image has four hands. He holds Trišula, Damaru, Nāg and sword</page><page sequence="7">Cult Images ofKonkan through Traditions, Religious Beliefs and Iconography 221 Fig. 6: Kalibhairva (Khadga). In the upper right hand he holds the bridle of horse (Fig. 6). This deity is the Kuladaivat of one Kale family living in village Asud. (d) Mārkā This is an Avyakta deity at Saldur. The villagers believe that, when a married woman gets into some trouble, she should appease this deity, so that suddenly the god Mārkā appears and takes away all her troubles. (e) Umbrādev In local language this deity is called Umbrā and perhaps related to Umbrā/Audumbar Fig. 7 : The image of Khem (The Indian fig tree) worship known widely in in Hindu tradition. This deity is worshipped in Saldur area. This is an Avyakta deity at Rajwadi. Enthoven (1915) defines this as 'an order of ghost'. If it is true then Umbrādev seems to be a benevolent spirit. (f) Khem Khem may be the corrupt version of Ksem. K§em means welfare, well-being, and happiness. In Pālī and Prākrut K§a are converted in Kha (Joshi 1979: 313,315). Changes of this kind offend occur in local languages. The story goes that this deity (K§em) used to travel/ move to small villages around Karde. Earlier the idol of Khem was</page><page sequence="8">222 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) taken in procession from one village to another on the circumference of the village Karde at the time of festivals. Once when the god was on this round, a deity called Nāntekarīņ from a nearby village followed him and migrated from her original village to Karde. After this incidence, the ancestors of the villagers decided not to take the procession out of village Karde. The Nāntekarīņ was installed outside the temple. It shows that the villagers had not accepted her (perhaps socially), and did not give her a place in the temple. Symbolically, the episode expresses a social, moral aspect of the society. Nāntekanņ' s migration was not acceptable, and thus teaches a lesson. If any villager has a keep or a concubine, the society will not accept her. It indicates a taboo on this kind of liaison in villages. We can conclude that small villages and societies give their moral lessons, through the myth, attached with village deity. The image of Khem has a face with moustache and has an appearance of a Mukhalinga (Fig. 7). (g) Vãrebuwâ People worship this deity in the month of May. Woman of Karde village worship this deity and perform a ritual or ceremony of Haldi- Kunku. People make a vow to this Värebuwä on Gudipãdwâ and offer him a coconut. There is no particular shape of this deity. Two stones are placed on a small plinth. One is an oval-shaped stone. The other is a little bigger than this stone, and has a small pit in the middle (Fig. 8). The above deity is called as Värebuwä and though people see it as a Fig. 8: Varebuwa different deity with different rituals attributed to it, it can said that this Värebuwä is a combination of a Linga and Yonipith and may have been related to fertility in ancient times. The stones will be the symbols of male and female genitals. Now the original symbolism or meaning of this deity is forgotten. Female Deities of Taluka Rajapur, District Ratnagiri (i) Vithalā Vithalā is a village deity of Tervan. The image has four hands. The deity is depicted holding Damaru, Trišula and Talwar (sword). The image is now worn out. A tiger (vahāna) is depicted behind this goddess. Vithalā wears a dhoti-like cloth. Its attributes indicate the idol to be a form of goddess Durgā.</page><page sequence="9">Cult Images of Konkan through Traditions, Religious Beliefs and Iconography 223 Fig. 9: Jugadevi (ii) Jugadevi This is another village deity from Tervan. The image has four hands. She holds a vessel, shield, sword and khanjir (a dagger). A small head of a man is depicted near the lower left hand. She wears a very long garland - Mālā / necklace (may be the narmundmālā , a garland of human heads). The deity is seated on a square seat. Left foot rests on the right leg. The right leg is slightly lifted (Fig. 9). This deity is worshipped by Lingâyat people. (iii) Kālīkā The idol of Kālīkā seen today in Tervan village is new one. The old idol of this deity has been thrown into the sea. The new image has four hands and holds Damaru, Trišula, Talwar (sword), and Pātra (vessel). Old images, when damaged or highly worn out, are consigned to the sea and not to the nearby river. The attributes of the earlier idol could not be ascertained. The attributes of the new images indicate it to be a form of Kālī, as also is indicated by the name. (iv) Mahākālī The Mahākālī temple of Adivare was built in A.D. 1250. Mahākālī' s image has four hands. She holds a Damaru, Trišula, Talwär (sword), and Panchapātra (vessel). She wears a garland and a Panchamukhī crown. This image was found in Vetye which is few kilometres away from Adivare village and brought to Adivare. There is a myth about this goddess. One Mr. Jadhav had a dream in which the goddess told him, "I am in Baul. Do something to arrange for my residence." After this, incident, he built a temple for her. The deity is said to go sometimes to her original residence at Baul. (v) Jākādevī This deity is a minor goddess (Enthoven 1915: appendix-XIV) of village Kasheli. The idol is in a standing position and has four hands. In two of the hands she holds a Trišula and a Damaru and the other two hands are in broken condition. Bhuts are the protectors of this deity. 'Jākā' is the corrupt form of the word 'Yak§ī'. In Pālī and Prākrut 'ya' is converted into 'ja' and 'k§' are converted into 'kkha'. Samartha Ramdas swami has given the names</page><page sequence="10">224 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) of the local deities of Maharashtra in his work 'Dāsbodha', where in he mentions Jākhmātā (Yak§amātā), Jakhiņ, Zoting, Vetāl, Mânayînî, etc. Today Yak§a pujā has become obsolete, but in several villages it still exists in the form of Lokopāsanā (worship by rural folk) (Joshi 1979: 313,314). The Yak§a cult still exists in people's mind. To date, the villagers worship Yak§a images in Konkan. Now the name is pronounced in its corrupt form and rituals are different, but the main core still exists here. There is one myth related to Jākādevī. Pujārī of this deity, Jayavant Gunaji told in the interview that, "Kālīkā from Vetye came to Kasheli to attend her sister's marriage. Her sister Jākādevī wanted to marry Kanäditya of Kasheli and Kālīkā had come there to give away her sister in marriage. She, however, married Kanäditya herself and Jākādevī remained unmarried." (vi) Âgwâdevî Âgwâdevî, a local deity of Kasheli village is a peculiar one. This idol was found in the sea. The image was broken into three pieces, and was joined later. The name Āgwā may have come from the Portuguese word 'Agua' , meaning 'water'. (vii) Āāryādurgā The deity is said to be originally from Ankola. The local legend tells us that every year one person named Palsule-Desai of Devihansol used to visit the goddess at Ankola. When he became old, he prayed to the goddess that, "Now due to old age, I can't come here to see you." His regret was obvious. At that time the goddess told him. "There is no need to come here to visit me. You start walking and I shall follow you. But remember, don't turn back to look at me." The old man started walking. He could hear the sound of the goddess's anklets. When he came near his village, he lost patience and turned back to look at the goddess. At that moment the goddess disappeared, but her footprint remained on the rock. At night, he had a dream. The goddess told him in the dream, "Now I live where I had disappeared. You will worship my foot impression." Mr. Palsule-Desai built a small dome on the foot print, and started the worship. This clearly indicates that the goddess of Ankola somehow became the village deity of Devihansol (now famous as Aâryâdurgâ). A poisonous snake is vāhan of this deity. Villagers consult a village deity named Jākādevī using 'Kaul'. Jākādevī tells the villagers whether to bring the idol of Navadurgā to meet Aâryâdurgâ. The idol of Navadurgā is picked up. It is believed that if the Kaul (oracle) by Jākādevī is adverse, the idol of Navadurgā becomes very heavy, and it is not possible to move it. The idol of Navadurgā can be moved only if the Kaul is favourable. The villagers do this ritual at Mārgašī§a Vadya Navamī (ninth day of the dark fortnight of Mārgašīr§a). (viii) Kālīkādurgā and Vithalādurgā Both are the village deities of Bhu village. Villagers stage the Dašāvatāra drama (Ten Incarnations) in front of these deities. They</page><page sequence="11">Cult Images ofKonkan through Traditions , Religious Beliefs and Iconography 225 enact the war of Hiranyakašyapu, his son and the Narasimha incarnation of Vi§nu. They also enact the story of Sahasrārjuna who abducted the Kāmadhenu belonging to the sage Jamadagni, father of Parašurāma. Female Deities of Taluka Dapoli, District Ratnagiri (A) Mahādevī and DurgādevT MahādevI is one of the six locally popular goddesses of Murud village. This goddess is also known as Sīmādevī. This deity may be the guardian goddess of the village boundary of the village or the village gate. The idol of Durgādevī is in the form of Mahi§āsurmardinī (the slayer of the demon Mahi§a). Sīmādevī and Durgādevī are believed to be sisters. (B) Kâleswarî Kâleswarî is another very powerful goddess of the Murud village and its surroundings. This deity is said to be the first wife of Bhairavanātha. The myth is that in a fit of anger, she went to live in Khotāchī Vādī (the upper class residential area). This deity is worshipped by Marāthā, Kuņbī Samāj and Bahujan Samāj. This image has four hands. She holds a sword and a shield .The lower right hand may be in Varadahasta mudrā, and in the lower left hand she holds some unidentifiable object. She wears a crown of a special/distinct type of design as depicted in Fig. 10. This design is called Mukut Bandhan (Joshi 1979: 34). It is important that she is not depicted wearing clothes, but is covered Fig. 10: Mukut Bandhan Fig. 11: Kaleswan from her breasts to her ankle by one big leaf (Fig. 11). In Vaišākha, villagers offer the sacrifice of three hens. Mr. Suresh Bal (formerly the Khot of the village) told in the interview during fieldwork that "In the 14th/15th century one Kanauji Brāhman laid down the rules for all these things. This deity is worshipped by the Marathā Kuņbī Samāj". (C) Jogeswarï Jogeswarï, another deity of Murud village is said to be the second wife of Bhairavanātha. From iconographie perspective Jogeswarï and Kâleswarî are one and the same deities, except that the image of Jogeswarï is not depicted as clad in a leaf.</page><page sequence="12">226 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) (D) Jakhamata This is an Avyakta deity of Murud village in the form of amorphous stone. Villagers call it Jākhamātā. Actually she is an example of people's belief in the Yak§a worship. Yak§a worship is still prevalent in various parts of Konkan. (E) Zolāī Actually, ichnographically speaking this image is of Mahi§āsurmardinī. But the villagers of Murud call it Zolāī. She has four hands. In the upper two hands she holds a sword and a shield. In the lower right hand she holds a Trišul and stabs Mahi§a. In the lower left hand, she holds the Mahi§a by his lower jaw. The right leg rests on Mahi§a's back. Devotees play a Kātkhel on Šīmgā. Kātkhel includes men holding wooden sticks in their hand and dance like the 'Garbā' . The Marathā Kuņbī Samāj worships this deity. This goddess desires to ride in a palanquin made of the tree named Nirgudî. But it is impossible to make a palanquin of NirgudL For this reason, Zolāī does not have a palanquin. Each one who participates in this Kātkhel is supposed to become Zolāī. Only one person from every ten villages is chosen for this ceremony and he must be between 1 8 to 25 years of age. After the end of the 'Hoļī' festival they start playing Kātkhel. The participants must undergo ten days of this ritual. All these participants wear nine- yard sārīs and each holds four sticks. They wield these sticks like a sword. The practice of warfare is the important aspect behind this ritual. The image of Zolāī at Karde is actually of Mahsāsurmardīnī. She has four hands. In the two upper hands she holds a sword and a shield. In lower left hand she holds a khanijr. Though the fourth hand is empty, from its position, it appears that, she may have been holding a big spear (which may later have been lost). She is riding a Mahisa (male buffalo) (Fig. 12). (G) Yogešwari This deity is said to be the wife of Kālabhairava of Asud. At Asud her image has four hands. In two hands, she holds a Trišul, and a Wādgā (bowl). In the lower left hand, she holds the reins of a horse. The fourth hand is empty. She Fig. 12: The image of Zolai at Karde</page><page sequence="13">Cult Images ofKonkan through Traditions, Religious Beliefs and Iconography 227 rides a horse. Kālabhairava and Yogeswan are shown facing south. This position is found very rarely in Indian iconology. The deity is a family god of a Kale family, the local residents of Asud. (H) Kālkāī This deity of Asud village is supposed to be the goddess of the married women. The moment the bridegroom or his family members do any injustice to the bride, the goddess is said to come to her rescue and solve all her problems. Because the goddess is so alert and prompt to help the married women, people are a little afraid of her and have turned over the idol (on her front) (Fig. 13). The jurisdiction of the goddess is supposed to be limited only to Asud. The villagers do not light a lamp every day in front of this deity; neither do they worship her every day. They worship her only on Hanumān Jayantî. (I ) Sīmādevī Sīmādevī of the Saldur village is an Avyakta deity. This deity is said to have appeared by Fig. 13: Kalkai herself (by her divine existence). The idol was caught in a fisherman's net, on Chaitra Shuddha DwâdasT (the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of the month Chaitra). The fisherman thought that it was an ordinary stone and he threw it back into the sea. On Trtiyâ the stone was again found at the same place where it was first found. The fisherman threw it back, again. But when that particular stone was caught in his net a third time, the stone bled. He put the stone aside, but he found the same stone in his net. Seeing this, he was frightened and ran towards the village. The villagers went with him and sow the situation. They found blood on the net and on the stone also. All the people took the stone and brought it to the village. A temple was built for this deity. The idol was found at the border of the village so people named her Sīmādevī. A pilgrimage to this deity is performed on Pādvā, Chaitra Šuddha Pratipadā (the first day of the bright fortnight of Chaitra). If a couple is childless, they vow to this deity. In this festival, devotees make new clothes for this goddess. This information was given by the Pujārī (priest) named Arvind Shevade. BankāT, Bankldevī, BānkarTņ, Zolāī, Taļekarīņa, all these deities are around the area of Saldur. (J) MahāmāT At Adkhal village one comes across a standing figure that looks like of a man. The image has an Adharlya (a lower garment). Villagers believe this as a female deity but the image does not show any feminine element in it. The figure holds buds of flower in the upper hands</page><page sequence="14">228 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) Fig. 14: Mahamai at Adkhal (Fig. 14). Ears of this deity are very large and he/she is shown wearing a headdress like a skull cap. (K) Nāntekarīņ The deity is placed outside the temple of Khem at Adkhal village. The villagers did not give her the place in the temple. According to the myth the village deity Khem used to travel in small villages around Karde. Once when on the round a deity named Nāntekarīņ from a nearby village followed and left her original village. The ancestors of present-day villagers thought her to be the concubine of Khem. So they did not include this deity inside Khem temple along with other deities. Observations and Conclusions In Konkan temples and shrines, the main idol is installed with a number of other deities. These subordinate deities are also worshipped by villagers. There are separate festivals and rituals connected with these deities. People of Konkan have great faith in both the main and minor deities. They deeply believe in their worship, faith, superstitions, in their rituals and religion. Their beliefs are mostly carried on intact, from generation to generation. The people of Konkan do their rituals from the heart, because their ancestors have done the same, great fear about nature and respect about it. Iconography and style of the minor deities are unique in Konkan. The sculptural representations of images are not very artistic. The images of the deities are simple and crudely made. Anatomically the depictions of the idols are short (the heads are big and the torso is disproportionate). They are depicted wearing scant garments and ornaments. These minor deities are the reflection of the life of various classes of society, e.g. the myth of 'Kâleswarï Devi 'of Murud village in Dapoli taluka is the reflection of the lifestyle, customs, social structure, social changes and the broad outlook of then contemporary people. It is observed that Shaivism is a popular cult in Konkan. Many Linga stones and Yonipithas are scattered in the villages of Konkan. It shows that the tradition of Linga worship in Konkan is still in practice, though the images are known to us now with some other or local name, e. g. Värebuwä.
