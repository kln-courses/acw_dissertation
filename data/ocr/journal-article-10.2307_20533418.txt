<plain_text><page sequence="1">75 P/raise the Titanic David Burleigh The sinking of the Titanic on 15th April 1912 was an event of major literary consequence. The English poet Thomas Hardy addressed the matter almost immediately, with some of his best-known lines, in 'The Convergence of the Twain, and it has since been the subject of epic poems by Canadian and German poets. There have been numerous other literary responses, in both poetry and prose, and not only in the English language. But it is some of the more localised responses that this paper will examine. There can be hardly anybody now who is unaware of the sinking of this famous ship, which is beyond doubt the most famous maritime disaster of this century, if not of all time. Its renewed fame at present depends mainly on the film and musical about it, though this is only the latest wave of attention to have been produced by the sinking of the vessel. The first songs about it were copyrighted weeks after it had gone down, and books about the ship and people connected with it appeared within the year. A major film followed Walter Lord's highly readable 1955 account, A Night to Remember, and had the same title. It is interesting to note that the musical and the second major film that have appeared more recendy both take their tides from the ship's name, which is apparently all that is necessary today. Yet neither of these very successful productions makes any reference to the north of Ireland, where the ship was built. In the 1910s British shipyards led the world, and Belfast led the British shipyards. It was for this very simple reason that the White Star Line, which at that time ran the largest ocean liners anywhere on its transatlantic crossings, had them built in Belfast. The Titanic was hence only one of a series, all of which had names like Majestic, Olympic, and so on. Shipbuilding was one of the two industries upon which the prosperity of Belfast in the early twentieth century stood, the other being linen. The linen industry was older, though by the time the Titanic was built, the Belfast shipyards still had half a century behind them. "Round these twin giants grew up all the subsidiary industries of a great port, engineering, rope-making, flour milling and the manufacture of tobacco, whiskey, chemicals and glass," says the</page><page sequence="2">76 historian A.T.Q. Stewart. However, the local context requires a little more detail, since the years immediately before World War I were a time of major crisis in the north of Ireland (a crisis from which full recovery has in some sense still not been effected). The story is told in Stewart's book, The Ulster Crisis: Resistance to Home Rule 1912-14, in which the author describes the fierce Protestant opposition to the threat of Home Rule for Ireland, and of the north being incorporated into an all-Ireland state. The arming of the Protestant community began, and the signing of the Ulster Covenant took place, just when the Titanic was under construction in the Belfast shipyards. Indeed the country was on the verge of civil war, which was only averted by the outbreak of hostilities in Europe. Stewart is surely right when he suggests that "[t]he sinking of the Titanic, at the height of the Home Rule crisis, was a staggering blow to Belfast's pride in her craftsmanship, and one, perhaps, from which she has never quite recovered." (45) This may help to explain why, until very recendy, the ship itself has been so little celebrated in the city to which it owed its very existence. The first Belfast poet upon whose consciousness the ship impinged was Louis MacNeice (1907-63), who as a child was taken to see the Titanic sail down Belfast Lough. MacNeice was actually living in Carrickfergus, where his father was the rector, but Carrickfergus looks onto the Lough and to that extent can be considered part of Belfast. MacNeice's biographer, Jon Stallworthy, writes: "One day the [MacNeice] children were taken up the hill to watch the newly launched Titanic heading for the sea." (33) We may take it that this was in 1912, when the ship departed for Southampton, unless it was on some kind of practice run: in fact the ship had been launched the year before, in 1911, before being taken to the fitting yards to receive her upper decks and funnels. In 1912 MacNeice was five years old, and we can imagine him holding his nurses hand as he watched the great ship steam off into the distance of the Irish Sea, never to return. Louis was the youngest of three children, the second of whom was born with Downs Syndrome, something hard for their mother to accept. It was not long after they saw the ship that the children said goodbye to their mother, who was taken away to a hospital in Dublin, never to return. Louis began to suffer from nightmares at that time: When I was five the black dreams came; Nothing after was quite the same. (Autobiography ) The way that MacNeice evokes the Belfast shipyards in his 1931 poem about the city has a nightmare tinge: Down there at the end of the melancholy lough</page><page sequence="3">Against the lurid sky over the stained water Where hammers clang murderously on the girders Like crucifixes the gantries stand. ('Belfast') This highly-coloured description might be from the hand of a Nineties poet, but the viewpoint, looking down the Lough, is clearly that of MacNeice s childhood home in Carrickfergus. Ten years later, in 1941, when MacNeice was making a radio programme about life on an American destroyer, he wrote a poem called 'Convoy, in the last stanza of which Jon Stallworthy, doubtless correcdy, finds an echo of Hardy in the expression "pride-of-life". In 'The Convergence of the Twain these lines occur: In a solitude of the sea Deep from human vanity, And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she. Given this specific clue, we can find further echoes of the disaster that befell the Titanic lurking behind this wartime poem, in the "blackboard sea" of the first stanza, for example, and the celebration of man's technical achievement, which nonetheless may end in failure. But the most direct reference in MacNeice to the Titanics fate comes another fifteen years after this, in a poem he wrote in 1956 on the death of his stepmother. Entided 'Death of an Old Lady, it very deftly compounds the old lady's demise with the poets own memories, using the metaphor of the ship. In its vividness and brevity it is typical of the best of MacNeice s later work. "It is hard to account for the Titanics hold on the poet's imagination," observes Stallworthy, "other than to suggest a subconscious association between its loss ... and the loss of his mother (to a psychiatric institution) in the same year, 1912." (421) These events would have seemed momentous, sudden and incomprehensible, and been linked in the child's imagination by their enormity. But there may be a simpler circumstantial reason for this late reminder: Walter Lord's highly successful book about the Titanic had appeared in 1955, the year before. One of MacNeice's last poems, 'Thalassa, is about setting out to sea, with what seems a further echo of Hardy before it establishes its upbeat theme: Let every adverse force converge ? Here we must needs embark again. It is as if he has finally laid the ghost. John Hewitt (1907-1987) was of an age with MacNeice and did in fact grow up in Belfast: perhaps because he was further inland, his poetry looks much more</page><page sequence="4">78 towards the country than the sea. After retirement, and return to his native city from a fifteen-year exile in Coventry in England, Hewitt wrote a good deal of new poetry. One late volume, Kites in Spring (1980), was madejup entirely of sonnets, written one or two a day over a period of months. This nostalgic book, printed in sepia ink with sepia illustrations, was an autobiography of childhood, and proved one of his more popular collections. In one poem in it, laconically entitled 'Late Spring 1912', the poet remembers deciphering the news about the Titanics sinking from a newsbill on the way to Bangor, presumably on some kind of outing. This was fairly precocious since he was only four and a half years old, though his father was a schoolmaster. One can't help wondering if Hewitt has added some of the details, about the Scott expedition for example, retrospectively, but we note the Belfast pride in "our safe unsinkable Titanic', a pride which was then severely damaged by the loss of the ship on her maiden voyage. But for Hewitt the event was just one of many in a well remembered and happy childhood, and it doesn't seem to have haunted him as it did MacNeice. The astute and able critic, John Wilson Foster, who first aired the question of the Titanic in its relation to Ulster writers in a paper at the John Hewitt Summer School from which I largely take my pointers, has now expanded his researches into a book. In his excellent and thought-provoking study, The Titanic Complex, Foster concisely surveys the still-growing literature about the ship, and one already so vast that it threatens to engulf the reader, which is why this paper has been restricted to a narrow theme. The next poet we must look at is an important successor to MacNeice, and like Hewitt grew up in Belfast. This is Derek Mahon (b.1941), whose whole work, regarded from a certain angle, seems to be a kind of slow shipwreck, taking place against the backdrop of a huge and indifferent silence. Many of Mahon's poems invoke the sea, usually being stared at thoughtfully from the shoreline. His first book, Night-Crossing (1968), takes its resonant title from a journey by sea, though in this case it is the overnight boat trip across the Irish Sea to England, the standard method of travel in Mahon's youth. It is this book which contains his soliloquy for Bruce Ismay, the unhappy chief of the White Star Line. Foster considers this the best poem on the Titanic by an Irish writer. In early versions of the poem Ismay was identified as the speaker in the tide, which has become After the Titanic in Mahon's 1991 Selected Poems. The poet asks us to consider the aftermath and ruin of Ismay's life, while he also wryly and brilliandy evokes the foundering itself: I turned to ice to hear my costly Life go thundering down in a pandemonium of Prams, pianos, sideboards, winches,</page><page sequence="5">79 Boilers bursting and shredded ragtime. In 'The Man who Built his City in Snow', an uncollected elegy for Wallace Stevens, published as a poem poster in 1972, Mahon deploys the best-known idiomatic reference to the ship in a line in the fourth stanza: "The leaves abdicate but the band plays on." The "desolate sea" and the "arctic light" that we find elsewhere in the same poem are also very typical of Mahon, and easily revert to the disaster under question. In an elegy for the poet's mother in The Yellow Book (1997), there is a parenthetical reference to the sunken liner, and to her sister ships: (Where now the great liners that raised their bows at the end of the street? Ophidian shapes among the chandeliers, wood-boring organisms at the swirling stairs.) Shipyards are a constant in Mahon's work The connection is originally a family one, but the fate of the Titanic seems always to loom powerfully in the offing. Robert Johnstone (b. 1951) opens his 1989 collection, Eden to Edenderry, with a suite of poems about the Titanic which rival Mahon in their evocation of the disaster, at the same time as they echo MacNeice in their eeriness and haunting. The first one, 'Robot Camera, brings us up to date in terms of underwater exploration, though it is actually an attempt to imagine death, that other world that the sunken ship has become in our imagination. The same theme is explored in several other poems, through a skillful juxtaposition of dream and imaginable happenings. In 'When it sank', the poet provides a marvellous description of the ship actually going down: As the embolus of icy water advanced up the hull towards the boilers there would have been some crumpling explosive fizzle as fires drowned and steam supercooled The "shuddering infarction" that follows has an anthropomorphic ring to it, suggesting individual demise and mortality in general. Here the ship, as metaphor, has notably become an unreserved and open subject, rather than the oblique, half hidden one it was before. The reason for this change may be that Johnstone was born well after the disaster, so that the tragic destruction of a great symbol of modernity has less consequence for him. Indeed by this time the story has almost become an inconsequential and trivial affair ? a piece of postmodern cultural bric-a-brac,</page><page sequence="6">80 arbitrary in its uses. This transformation is part of Foster's thesis, and Johnstone s poem 'It can't go on nicely bears that out: There are playbills, old photographs, a glass case Of Titanic memorabilia. Titanic chinaware, for example: The great ship at the bottom of your soup. One illustration in a Titanic special issue of the journal Causeway in 1996 showed a china teapot in the shape of the ship, wittily named 'Teatanic' (27). In the last poem of Johnstone's suite, he direcdy rewrites MacNeice s poem 'Charon, which brings us neatly to another Belfast poet who has reworked poems by MacNeice. Ciaran Carson (b. 1948) has now written more extensively about Belfast than almost anybody, not only in his many poems about the city, but also in his prose. There is, however, virtually no mention of the Titanic in any of Carson's poetry, except for a nominal reference in First Language (1993), appropriately in a poem called 'The Brain of Edward Carson. This does seem to support one's general feeling that the ship figures overwhelmingly in the consciousness of the Protestant community: Carson is the only writer mentioned so far who does not belong to it. Nevertheless, he gives it a chapter in his indefinable prose book, The Star Factory (1997), which consists of labyrinthine recollections of the city, past and present. The interesting, perhaps significant, feature of the Titanic chapter, is that it is made up almost entirely of extracts from other books about the liner. It is true of course that a great deal has been written about this ship, and it is also true that Carson quotes sometimes at length in other chapters. But the fact that this chapter alone is composed almost exclusively of other people's writings suggests that the subject doesn't interest Carson very deeply. In the last paragraph only does he make a personal response, when he remembers "my own dreams about the Titanic, where I am a disembodied robotic eye, gliding like a wayward star through the adits of its wrecked Adantean cathedral" (60). In this lovely sentence he touches on one feature of the Titanic story on which its enduring appeal almost certainly depends: its modern replay of the ancient myth of the lost city of Adantis. It is typical of Carson's generosity of spirit to want to include everything about the city that is the subject of his work. His new selected poems, //. M S. Belfast, which is his latest publication, draws on his earlier collections, and yet does not treat the most famous product of the Belfast shipyards. One clue as to why the Titanic seems not to engage a poet who grew up in the Catholic community of Belfast may lie in the tide of an earlier collection by him, Belfast Confetti (1989). This is a dark subject indeed, but A.T.Q. Stewart tells us that this phrase goes back to the</page><page sequence="7">81 time of the signing of the Ulster Covenant, when Catholics working in the shipyards were the object of Protestant hostility Following one bout of trouble, he writes, Roman Catholic workmen found themselves surrounded by knots of hostile Protestants who ordered them to put on their coats and leave the yards, and when they did so, some of them were knocked down and beaten, or pelted with 'Belfast confetti', the steel discs punched out of the plates by the riveters. (60) That was in 1912, the year that the Titanic sank, so it is no wonder that the Catholic community does not find much cause for celebration in the story of the ship, and it is a measure of Carson's tolerance that he mentions it at all. 'Belfast confetti' has of course acquired a slightly different nuance since Stewart s book was published. Foster suggests that, even among Protestants, pride in the shipbuilding industry has been inhibited and darkly haunted by what befell its most famous product. The Ulster Titanic Society, for example, is of very recent vintage, having been formed only in 1992, fully eighty years after the ship went down, whereas societies elsewhere (Germany, South Africa, New Zealand, as well as the United States) have a much longer history. The paperback version of Ciaran Carson's book is decorated both back and front with pictures of the ship, which as I have indicated is not central to its contents, but is now perhaps the most readily identifiable symbol of the city. A recent novel about Belfast, subsequently filmed, is called Titanic Toum, though it has nothing whatever to do with the ship. But Ulster, quiedy reclaiming some of the glory of its past, and at last taking proper pride in its achievements, is today experiencing something of a Titanic boom. Not only is there a permanent exhibition at the Ulster Folk Museum, but every bookshop in the country has a solid shelf, if not a case, full of books upon the subject, some of them now published locally. Fame has its own momentum, which commerce will exploit: other shipwrecks, such as the Lusitania, which was torpedoed by the Germans off the coast of Ireland in World War I, with almost equal loss of life, are being promoted in the wake of the Titanic. You have only to surf the Internet a little to find some of the current titles: 882? Questions about the Titanic, 1912 Facts about Titanic, Total Titanic, Titanic for Idiots; Build Your Own Titanic, and so forth. I would like to finish with a personal anecdote which seems to me to indicate the point we have reached today in all of this. When I was staying not long ago with my sister in Bangor, I noticed on the stairs of her house a print of the Titanic with two signatures on it, which my brother-in-law explained were the signatures of two local survivors. I later found them named in a magazine article. But I was further intrigued when my brother-in-law, who is an ex-seaman and now the manager of a</page><page sequence="8">82 marina doubling as a harbourmaster, told me that one of the very elderly survivors had been got lately for the opening of a new shipping office in Belfast, and that for the owners this was something of a coup. It seemed somehow to clarify the legendary status the tragedy has now acquired, and tfre self-generating power of fame, that a shipping company could attract business in the name of a vessel that so catastrophically sank!
