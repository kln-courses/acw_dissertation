To determine how this system functioned in southern Jordan (Edom) and the Negev, 19th-century ethnographic data from the same area is used to derive a model of how different tribal groups interacted. The model is based on five aspects: territory and movement, trade, interaction with a gateway town, relationship to cen- tral government, and relationship with an imperial power. It is proposed that this model can be appropriately applied to the late Iron Age in southern Jordan and the Negev. Edom was composed of largely independent tribes connected by bonds of alle- giance, who interacted with others from Arabia, the Negev, and the west, and con- trolled the trade among Arabia, Edom, the Beersheba Valley, and Gaza. Certain towns on this route were gathering places for such groups or centers controlling Assyrian interests in the Arabian trade. OBJECTIVES ecent research on the Transjordanian Iron Age kingdoms stresses their tribal nature, involvement in the Arabian trade via the Negev, regional variation, and the mixture of pottery traditions at certain sites (e.g., LaBianca and Younker 1995; Younker 1997; 1999; LaBianca 1999; Knauf- Belleri 1995; Bienkowski in press a). It is also be- coming clearer that southern Jordan and the Negev cannot be treated separately: in antiquity they were complementary and part of the same environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic system (e.g., Finkel- stein 1995; Singer-Avitz 1999). The purpose of this paper is to propose a new framework for under- standing the late Iron Age in southern Jordan and the Negev-essentially the peak of the kingdom of Edom, the (Iron Age) Arabian trade, and contact with Assyria in the late eighth and seventh centuries B.C. This framework is based on a model derived from 19th-century ethnographic evidence, and data from the Roman-Byzantine period, from exactly the same area. In those periods, the interaction of tribal groups with towns, with the government or with an imperial power, and their involvement in trade, has many parallels with the situation in the late Iron Age. The paper is organized in six sections: (1) a review of current research and problems in the Iron Age of southern Jordan and the Negev; (2) a focus on the complex variety within ceramic as- semblages in late Iron Age sites in the region, a pattern that has not been properly recognized and requires explanation that current reconstructions of the Iron Age do not adequately provide; (3) a brief review of recent research on the tribal nature of the Iron Age kingdoms, which provides an over- arching theoretical framework for which this paper 21</page><page sequence="2">22 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 attempts to present empirical evidence; (4) a presen- tation of 19th-century ethnographic and Roman- Byzantine literary evidence from southern Jordan and the Negev; (5) a derivation of a five-part model from that evidence-based on activities that the evidence shows were constant to all periods in this area-and application of each part of the model to the evidence from the Iron Age; and (6) a conclu- sion summarizing the new framework for the late Iron Age which results from application of the model. It should be stressed that the paper's objec- tive is to gain new insights into the late Iron Age: the primary purpose of presenting the 19th-century material-although of considerable interest in its own right-is that it provides a rich pattern of activ- ities against which the relatively mute Iron Age evidence can be compared. This paper does not at- tempt to come to any new conclusions about south- ern Jordan and the Negev in the 19th century. AMMON JUDAH Hebron aza MOAB T. Jceh T Sera' S Haru ' T. .

SOUTHERN JORDAN AND THE NEGEV IN THE IRON AGE: CURRENT STATUS OF RESEARCH AND PROBLEMS Geographical Terms of Reference During the Iron Age, southern Jordan was the area that in the Old Testament and in Assyrian in- scriptions is called the kingdom of Edom, while the Negev, or at least the northern Negev, was in the southern part of the kingdom of Judah. It is difficult to disentangle the use of "Edom" as a geographical term from its political implications, and the two were not always coincidental. In general Edom extended, on the east side of the Wadi Arabah, from the Wadi Hasa in the north, which runs into the Dead Sea, certainly as far as Ras an-Naqb in the southern Ara- bah and possibly to the Red Sea (see fig. 1; Bartlett 1989: 33-54; Edelman 1995). This paper adopts the modern definition of the term "Negev," the entire triangle from Beersheba to Eilat (Rainey 1984: 90). The Negev can be conveniently divided into three ecological niches, each with a distinctive environ- ment or resources that have attracted human settle- ment: the Beersheba Valley, the Negev Highlands, and the Wadi Arabah (cf. Finkelstein 1995: 3-8). In the late Iron Age, the focus of this paper, settlement was essentially concentrated in the Beersheba Val- ley, the most passable valley in the Negev and the setting of the "biblical Negev" (Singer-Avitz 1999: 10; Rainey 1984: 90), together with CEn Haseva in the Wadi Arabah, and Kadesh-Barnea and Kuntillet CAjrud, both in northern Sinai on the western edge of the Negev Highlands (Finkelstein 1995: 139). The Development of the Iron Age in Southern Jordan There is no evidence of any settled occupation south of the Wadi Hasa in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages (ca. 1950-1200/1150 B.C.) (Bienkow- ski 1992; 1995; 2001b). The Negev was sparsely set- tled in the same periods (Finkelstein 1995: 27), with Middle Bronze II attested only at Tel Masos and Malhata and Late Bronze II only at Timna (Fritz and Kempinski 1983; Kochavi 1993; Rothenberg 1993).1 1 To the northwest of Beersheba, sites occupied in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages were Tel Haror, Tell el-FarCah, Tell Jemmeh, and Tel Serac (Oren 1993a; Yisraeli 1993; Van Beek 1993; Oren 1993b).</page><page sequence="3">2001 TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS: THE LATE IRON AGE 23 However, Egyptian inscriptions of the late second millennium B.C. record that Edom and Seir were in- habited by Shasu, nomadic pastoralists who lived in tents and kept flocks of sheep (Kitchen 1992). In the Old Testament, "Seir" eventually came to be syn- onymous with Edom, but may originally have re- ferred to parts of both Edom and the Negev, perhaps around the Wadi Arabah (Bartlett 1989: 41-44; Edelman 1995: 8-10). Until recently, there was no clear evidence of any Iron Age settlement in southern Jordan prior to the late eighth century B.C. at the earliest (Bienkowski 1992). Recent radiocarbon dates from slag piles in the Wadi Faynan area indicate some exploitation of copper there between the twelfth and tenth centuries B.C., although none of this activity can at present be associated with any settlements (Levy, Adams, and Shafiq 1999; Bienkowski 2001b). Burials radiocar- bon dated to the tenth-ninth centuries B.C. have been found in the nearby Wadi Fidan. They contained beads, textiles, leather, metal jewelry, and wooden bowls, but no associated pottery, prompting specula- tion that they might be associated with pastoral no- madic groups such as those mentioned in Egyptian inscriptions (Levy, Adams, and Shafiq 1999). The earliest Iron Age settlements in Edom so far discov- ered are at Khirbat en-Nahas and Barqa el-Hetiye in the Faynan area, both radiocarbon dated to the ninth century B.C., and perhaps to be interpreted as small mining settlements (Fritz 1994; 1996; Hauptmann 2000: 189 interprets Barqa el-Hetiye as a "control station" on the route from Faynan to the Wadi Arabah).2 This most recent evidence may be suggesting that, in the early Iron Age, mining recommenced in the Wadi Faynan area after a gap of nearly 1,000 years, and it may have been associated with non- sedentary pastoralist groups (Levy, Adams, and Shafiq 1999; Bienkowski 20001b).3 Some of these groups-or perhaps others-may have settled in the area, at Barqa el-Hetiye and Khirbat en-Nahas, by the ninth century B.C. It may be that a mixed popu- lation of pastoralists, semisedentary agriculturalists, and miners were involved in copper production at that time. By the late eighth century B.C., settlement had expanded and intensified all over Edom, and all the other Iron Age sites so far excavated appear to date between the late eighth and fourth centuries B.C. (Bienkowski 1995).4 The development of a copper industry may well have been a factor in state forma- tion in Edom. The huge scale of the operations must have required considerable organization. It has been estimated that the most important Iron Age copper- production centers in the Faynan area-Faynan 5, Khirbat en-Nahas, and Khirbat el-Jeriye-produced 2 Fritz (1994) dated the Iron Age structure at Barqa el-Hetiye to Iron I, largely on the basis of the presence of "Midianite" pottery (otherwise known as "Qurayya painted ware;" cf. Parr 1988), once regarded as restricted to Iron I. Not available in time for his publication was a radiocarbon date from the site calibrated to 905-835 B.C. (now published in Levy, Adams, and Shafiq 1999: table 2; and Hauptmann 2000: 66 table 7), indicating a ninth-century B.C. date, similar to Khirbat en-Nahas. There is now considerable evidence for the continuity of Qurayya painted ware well into Iron II, certainly into the ninth century B.C. and possibly later, since one sherd was found in a stratified seventh-sixth-century B.C. context at Tawilan (Bienkowski 2001b). 3 A radiocarbon date from Mine 42 in the Wadi Khalid in the Faynan area, calibrated to 1510-1415 B.C. (Haupt- mann 2000: 66, 83), might imply some Late Bronze Age mining activity, but at present it is an isolated date within a thousand-year gap. Nevertheless, if we accept that be- tween the twelfth and tenth centuries B.C. some mining was carried out by nonsedentary pastoralist groups, it can- not be excluded that similar groups were active earlier. Indeed, perhaps we may eventually have to contemplate the possibility that there was never a complete cessation of mining at Faynan, but that it continued at a low or- ganizational and technological level, presumably reusing earlier mines (e.g., in Wadi Khalid Mine 42, reusing the Early Bronze Age works; cf. Hauptmann 2000: 82-83). 4 The "standard" dating of Edomite sites has been to the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. (e.g., Bienkowski 1995). However, the presence of (locally made) painted "Edomite" pottery in Beersheba Stratum II, now gener- ally accepted to have been destroyed by Sennacherib in 701 B.C. (e.g., Singer-Avitz 1999: 11-12, 30-38), suggests that similar pottery at Edomite sites such as Busayra and Tawilan should be dated to the late eighth century B.C. In the course of preparing the final report on the excavations at Busayra, one of the authors (P.B.) has discovered fourth-century B.C. Attic sherds stratified in the final occupation deposit at the site, proving conclu- sively that the Iron Age settlement continued to the end of the Persian period, similar to the situation farther north in Jordan (Herr 1995; 1999; Bienkowski 2001a). Thus, the dates for Edomite settlement should now be extended from the late eighth to fourth centuries B.C. One stratified sherd at Busayra has third-century B.C. parallels: this might be a stray, alternatively it might im- ply that occupation continued even later, into the Early Hellenistic period.</page><page sequence="4">24 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 between 6,500 and 13,000 tons of copper, consider- ably more than in any other period (Hauptmann 2000: 97 table 9, 99, 155, 189-90).5 It may be sig- nificant that Edom's major center ("capital"?), Bu- sayra, was later located close to the Faynan area (Knauf and Lenzen 1987; Knauf 1992: 50-53; Knauf-Belleri 1995: 111-14). The intensification of late Iron II settlement in Edom also coincided with the period of the Assyrian empire. Edom first paid tribute to Adad-nirari III in 796 B.C., and from the time of Tiglath-pileser III's conquests in 732 B.C. it regularly paid tribute (Millard 1992; Bienkowski 2000). The beneficial political and economic effects of the pax Assyriaca may well have encouraged settlement-certainly elsewhere in the empire, the Assyrians actively settled populations (Kuihne 1994), and it is likely, although not proved, that they were interested in the Faynan copper (Knauf-Belleri 1995: 113). Another key factor may have been the Arabian trade in luxury goods such as frankin- cense, which was certainly operating by the eighth century B.C. (Singer-Avitz 1999).6 The ultimate ter- mini of this trade were in Mesopotamia, Damascus, and Gaza. Although its Iron Age routes are far from certain, and indeed there is no conclusive proof that the route(s) included Edom, Singer-Avitz (1999) and Finkelstein (1995: 152-53) argue persuasively for a route through Edom (specifically Busayra) via the Beersheba Valley to Gaza. The fate of the kingdom of Edom, and of Iron Age settlement in the area, is still not certain. Neo- Babylonian interest in Edom is reflected in a cam- paign against Edom or Busayra in Nabonidus's third year (553 B.C.) recorded in the Nabonidus Chronicle (Beaulieu 1989: 166, 169), in the relief at Sela' near Busayra, now attributed to Nabonidus (Dalley and Goguel 1997), and in the presence in Babylonia of a number of seventh-century B.C. (probably Neo- Babylonian) seals with likely Edomite names (Mitch- ell 1991: 419 with references). It is still possible that Edom was annexed by the Neo-Babylonians, but the final destructions of Busayra and other sites can no longer be attributed to Nabonidus since there is proof that settlement continued to the end of the Per- sian period (see n. 4). Presumably Edom became part of the Persian empire, although there is no evi- dence for its provincial status as there is for Ammon (Herr 1999: 233-34). Another cause must be sought for the massive final destruction of Busayra, now dated ca. 300/200 B.C. (contra Bennett 1983). The Iron Age in the Negev The broad development of the Iron Age in the Negev is fairly well established, although its pre- cise chronology and interpretation are disputed. In- tensification of settlement at the beginning of the Iron Age was characterized by the 12th to 11lth- century B.C. "fort" at Tel Masos and by a few other 11th-century B.C. sites in the Beersheba Valley, and by about 350 sites (including about 50 "fortresses") in the Negev Highlands;7 the long-running dispute regarding the latter concerns their date (11 th or 10th century B.C.), whether they were Israelite or in- digenous, and whether they were "royal" fortresses with associated agricultural hamlets or civilian settle- ments. Most recently, Finkelstein (1995: 103-26) has argued that the Iron I sites in the Negev were the result of sedentarization of desert people, stimulated by copper mining and the development of the Ara- bian incense trade (see n. 6; for an opposing view, see Cohen 1979; 1993). The Negev Highlands sites, and Tel Masos, Tel Esdar, and Nahal Yatir in the Beersheba Valley, were abandoned in the tenth century B.C. But the Beersheba Valley continued to flourish in Iron II, with tenth- to ninth-century B.C. "fortified towns" at Beersheba, Malhata, Arad, and CEn Haseva in the Arabah, and intensification of settlement in the eighth to sixth centuries B.c. (cf. generally Finkel- stein 1995: 139-53, and Bartlett 1999: 103-5, with references). The presence of pottery and ostraca identified as "Edomite" at many of these late Iron II sites (see, e.g., Mazar 1985) is variously interpreted. Beit-Arieh regards it as evidence of Edomite pene- tration into southern Judah and interprets the in- creased settlement in the eastern Negev, especially the construction of fortified sites such as Horvat Tov, Arad, Horvat CUza, and Horvat Radum, as a Judaean 5 Hauptmann's estimate is based on 100,000-130,000 tons of slag at a ratio of metal to slag of between 1:10 and 1:15. 6 There are suggestions that the Arabian trade may have commenced considerably earlier, at the end of the Late Bronze Age (Artzy 1994; Jasmin 1999) or in Iron I (Finkelstein 1995: 122). 7 In addition, Yotvata in the southern Arabah is an ir- regular casemate fortress dated to Iron I and apparently reminiscent of the Negev Highlands "fortress" sites (Meshel 1993: 1518).</page><page sequence="5">2001 TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS: THE LATE IRON AGE 25 2 3 o 5 4 6 ~7A 8 0 5 11 13 12 Fig. 2.

In this recon- struction, the "cult sites" of Horvat Qitmit in the Beersheba Valley and cEn Haseva in the Arabah are characterized as "Edomite shrines." An alternative view concludes that there is no clear evidence of Edomite military incursions and interprets the "Edo- mite" pottery and ostraca as evidence of the trade route from Arabia via Edom and the Beersheba Val- ley to Gaza, initially in the eighth century B.C. through Beersheba, and continuing in the seventh century B.C. after the latter's destruction by Sennach- erib in 701 B.C. (Finkelstein 1995: 139-53; Singer- Avitz 1999; cf. Bienkowski and Sedman in press). From this perspective, Horvat Qitmit and cEn Haseva are interpreted as roadside shrines along the Ara- bian trade route, used by local pastoral nomads and itinerant traders (Finkelstein 1995: 149; Bienkowski and Sedman in press). Some time in the late seventh or sixth century B.C., many of the Beersheba Valley sites were aban- doned or destroyed, perhaps in connection with the Babylonian invasion, and the area was relatively sparsely populated in the Persian period (Beit-Arieh 1999: 3; Bartlett 1999: 103-4). The idea that the Persian-Hellenistic territory of "Idumaea" derived its name and territory from the occupation of the same area by Edomites in late Iron II has now been criticized by Bartlett (1999). He points out that the core of later Idumaea was well to the north of the Beersheba Valley and concludes that the Greek transliteration "Idumaea" had no connection with the political Iron II kingdom of Edom. CERAMIC COMPLEXITY IN LATE IRON II IN SOUTHERN JORDAN AND THE NEGEV A characteristic of the material culture of late Iron II in southern Jordan and the Negev is the variation in pottery between sites and the com- plexity of the individual ceramic assemblages. Pre- vious scholarship has cataloged this pottery neatly under two "political/cultural" labels, "Edomite" and "Judaean," but these fail to reflect this complexity. Southern Jordan In general, pottery assemblages within Transjor- dan show marked regional variation from north to south. Of course there are similarities, but styles of painting, surface finishes, simple bowl shapes, and even bases are different (cf., for example, Hendrix, Drey, and Storfjell 1997: 170-202; Bienkowski in press b). While it is possible to regard at least some of these differences as representing the regional or national assemblages of Edom, Moab, and Ammon (Herr 1997: 118, 151-54), the situation is more complex than that, since within the "national" re- gions themselves there are also variations. In Edom, painted pottery (fig. 2:1-4) is extremely rare on the distinctive "mountaintop" sites in the region of Petra, such as Umm el-Biyara, Bacja III, es-Sadeh, and Jabal al-Qseir (Zeitler 1992: 172-76; Lindner et al. 1996), but is found in quantity at Tawilan (Hart 1995a) and Khirbat al-MuCallaq (Lindner, Knauf, and Zeitler 1996), both in the immediate vicinity of Petra. A unique range of painted pottery and of very fine decorated wares is found at Busayra, the major center in Edom (Oakeshott 1983). Particular wares are found only in the north of Edom; certain krater or pithoi forms are measurably more common in the south than in the north of Edom (Bienkowski and Adams 1999: 158-60). Tell el-Kheleifeh has a unique mixture of Edomite, Negevite, "Midianite," Greek, Arabian, and Egyptian pottery and other objects (Glueck 1993: 869; Pratico 1993; for Negev ware and "Midianite" ware, see fig. 2: 8-10).8 It has been argued that some of these variations, in partic- ular the occurrence of painted pottery, have chrono- logical significance, and that painted decoration is a later development in Edomite pottery (Hart 1995b: 264). An alternative view is that the variations are connected with site location, since the sites with lit- tle or no painted pottery are all situated on plateaus 8 The "Midianite" pottery (or Qurayya painted ware) at Kheleifeh was not reliably stratified, while the fifth- and fourth-century B.C. Greek sherds came from Glueck's Stratum V which was poorly preserved (Pratico 1993: 49-50). These two groups of pottery are therefore nor- mally disassociated from the main Iron II settlement at Kheleifeh. However, their association with the Iron II settlement should not be totally excluded, on three counts: first, Qurayya painted ware is now known to con- tinue into Iron II, and it occurs in a stratified Iron II deposit at Tawilan (cf. n. 2; Hart 1995a: 60; Bienkowski 2001b); second, stratified fourth-century B.C. Greek pot- tery is associated with the Iron II/Persian settlement at Busayra (cf. n. 4); and third, renewed excavations at Kheleifeh are drastically revising Glueck's stratigraphy and plans, and it is conceivable that his original division into strata will not survive this reappraisal (Mussell 1999).</page><page sequence="7">2001 TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS: THE LATE IRON AGE 27 of high mountains in the Petra region (Zeitler 1992: 172; Bienkowski 1995: 52). This latter explana- tion-variation due to site location-now seems to be confirmed: recent study by one of the present writers (P.B.) of the pottery from Umm el-Biyara and Busayra indicates that painted pottery does in- deed occur at Umm el-Biyara (although it is rare), and it is also found in the earliest of three stratified phases at Busayra. The Negev Each of the late Iron II Negev sites had a slightly different assemblage of pottery of different tradi- tions and regions, although most of the clays appear to be local.9 Singer-Avitz (1999: 12, 56-57) has highlighted Beersheba Stratum II's mixture of Ju- daean (84.18%), coastal (12.53%), and other (north- ern, Edomite, assyrianizing, Egyptian-3.27%) pot- tery, as well as the presence of objects with Arabian parallels (1999: 50-52; see fig. 2 for pottery types). She cites similar patterns at other Beersheba Val- ley sites (1999: 56-57)-Tel cIra (cf. also Freud 1999: 226-27), Aroer (cf. also Biran and Cohen 1981), Arad, and Malhata (cf. also Beit-Arieh 1998) -and concludes that these assemblages reflect the path of the Arabian trade route, via cEn Haseva and Busayra. Some of these same patterns can also be seen at Horvat Qitmit (Beit-Arieh 1995a) and cEn Haseva (Cohen and Yisrael 1995a; 1995b), and at Tell el-Kheleifeh (see above, and Pratico 1993). These patterns are not easy to explain, especially when the assemblages are investigated in more depth. For example, the occurrence of Judaean, Edomite, and coastal cooking pots in these assem- blages is highly variable (fig. 2:11-13). Cooking pots are often regarded as perhaps the subtlest indi- cator of the presence or direct influence of distinct cultural groups, since the shape of a cooking pot precisely reflects distinct culinary traditions, which are generally conservative (cf. Hesse 1986; Finkel- stein 1997: 230). Furthermore, Edomite cooking pots are regarded as among the most characteristic Edomite vessels (cf. Beit-Arieh 1995b: 34; Singer- Avitz 1999: 32). Despite the presence in the assem- blage of Edomite and coastal pottery, Beersheba Stratum II (eighth century B.C.) appears to have only Judaean cooking pots, while the seventh-century B.C. deposits at cEn Haseva appear to have only Edo- mite cooking pots, despite the presence there of Judaean pottery; only Malhata has a complete range of Judaean, Edomite, and coastal cooking pots (per- sonal communication, I. Beit-Arieh). Yet even at Malhata it is not easy to split up the assemblages into their "constituent" cultural components: the distinctive green-white local Negev clay is used for both Judaean and Edomite pottery, but quite differ- ent fabrics are used for the Judaean and Edomite cooking pots, the latter from an apparently nonlocal mica clay.10 There has been a tendency to overemphasize the "Edomite" component in the Negev assemblages, and to simplistically interpret most "non-Judaean" characteristics as the result of Edomite influence or presence, without attempting to acknowledge and explain the complex mixes and variations in assem- blages (e.g., Beit-Arieh 1995a; 1995b; but see now Singer-Avitz 1999 for a proper contextual study). For example, the shrine at Horvat Qitmit was judged to be non-Judaean and interpreted as Edomite be- cause of the occurrence in the assemblage of some pottery with parallels in Edom, even though no ce- ramic statues of the type found at Qitmit had ever been found in Edom proper (Beck 1995: 190). The discovery of similar anthropomorphic statues at cEn Haseva Stratum 4 prompted its identification too as an Edomite shrine (Cohen and Yisrael 1995a; 1995b; Beck 1996). However, the pottery from cEn Haseva, studied in context, provides a unique insight into this problem of mix and variety and allows a different interpretation. The late Iron Age Stratum 4 (seventh-sixth centuries B.C.) at CEn Haseva consists of afavissa (a cultic pit) possibly associated with a shrine, and de- posits inside a "fort," which was used throughout the Iron Age and in Nabataean/Roman times (Cohen and Yisrael 1995a: 23-27). The preliminary reports so far published (Cohen and Yisrael 1995a; 1995b) assign the remains of a small fort to Stratum 4, con- temporary with the favissa. However, one of the 9 Some of the vessels with non-Judaean character- istics from Beersheba Stratum II were made of a terra rosa clay from the Judaean hills and the Shephelah, not local to the Beersheba area. Singer-Avitz (1999: 20, 38) speculates whether it was the clay or the vessels that were transported. 10P.B. is grateful to Professor Itzhaq Beit-Arieh for showing him the pottery from Malhata and Horvat Qit- mit, stored at the Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University.</page><page sequence="8">28 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 excavators, Y. Yisrael, now responsible for the final publication, has revised the stratigraphy and be- lieves that all the seventh-sixth-century B.C. materi- als in the fort area were found out of context in later fills (personal communication). Furthermore, imme- diately to the northwest of cEn Haseva is a hill called Givat Haseva with a surveyed but unpub- lished smelting site that yielded a collection of sherds including some seventh-sixth-century B.C. pottery. Thus, there are three distinct seventh-sixth- century B.C. contexts from cEn Haseva: the favissa, unstratified pottery from later fills, and unstratified survey material from Givat Haseva. The favissa, located outside the northern wall of the fort, contained more than 60 pottery vessels and statues, and seven stone altars, crushed and appar- ently deliberately buried. This appears to be a com- plete cultic assemblage, probably from an adjacent small building that has been interpreted as a shrine; S. Ben-Arieh, who is responsible for the final report on the favissa pottery, believes that there are exactly two of every type of vessel (personal communica- tion).11 This favissa assemblage has previously been identified as "Edomite" (Cohen and Yisrael 1995a: 27). However, the only parallel with pottery from Edom is the frequent denticulation at the edges of vessels; this is certainly found at Busayra and Tell el-Kheleifeh, but in fact it seems to occur in greater profusion at cEn Haseva and at other sites in the Negev (cf. Beit-Arieh 1995b: 33-34), and it may well be a characteristic of Negev assemblages rather than specifically of Edom. Indeed, the typical pot- tery from Edom, which would be reasonably ex- pected at an Edomite site, is missing from the favissa, and essentially the pottery and the statues are of a kind completely unparalleled in Edom, while the numerous incense burners are paralleled in Judah (Cohen and Yisrael 1995a: 27). Clearly, this favissa assemblage is not Edomite. However, in the fills in the fort area, and at Givat Haseva, one finds characteristic painted "Edo- mite" pottery, and "Edomite" cooking pots, but also Judaean pottery, Qurayya painted ware, Ne- gev ware, and probably Cypro-Phoenician pottery. Although these are unstratified contexts, it is conceivable that all these types originated from a seventh-sixth-century B.C. assemblage.12 These de- posits can be interpreted as yet another example of the mixture of ceramic traditions characteristic of Negev sites in late Iron II. Yet, rather than treating these deposits and the favissa as a single assem- blage, we should acknowledge that they are separate and that the differences might be significant. The favissa is a sealed assemblage probably characteris- tic of the Negev itself rather than of Edom or Judah, and it does not have this mixture of pottery tradi- tions. This cult assemblage can be interpreted as originating from a local shrine located outside the walls of the cEn Haseva fort. The mixed deposits from the fills in the fort area and from Givat Haseva, on the other hand, can be interpreted as the pottery made and left by a variety of groups who lived in or passed through cEn Haseva and perhaps utilized the shrine. From this perspective, cEn Haseva had a similar function to Horvat Qitmit as characterized by Finkelstein (1995: 149), a roadside shrine estab- lished by local groups on a main route of the Ara- bian trade, utilized by the different peoples active on the route. Finkelstein concluded that the shrine at Qitmit was venerated and perhaps established by local pastoral nomads, and visited by local Arabs and by caravaneers of different origins. IRON AGE TRIBES AND TRIBAL KINGDOMS The tribal nature of the Iron Age kingdoms of the southern Levant-Edom, Moab, Ammon, Israel, Judah-has been the subject of much recent research and can help to put the above data into perspective. A traditional interpretation of the Old Testament and of the Assyrian inscriptions has regarded these as centralized, monolithic kingdoms, ruled by kings, with a capital, a state god, and a palace-based ad- ministrative structure. Recent work on their social organization, however, concludes that they never ceased to be essentially kin-based or tribal (LaBi- anca and Younker 1995; Younker 1997; LaBianca 1999; cf. also Knauf 1992; Knauf-Belleri 1995). They lacked some of the essential features of true nation-states and remained fundamentally tribal so- 11 P.B. thanks Sara Ben-Arieh for many profitable dis- cussions about the cEn Haseva favissa pottery at the Is- rael Museum, Jerusalem. 12 For Qurayya painted ware continuing into Iron II, cf. n. 2.

Specifically regarding Edom, La- Bianca and Younker's (1995: 406-11) hypotheses would seem to be borne out by the evidence: com- pared with Moab and Ammon, Edom had less set- tlement density, less land-tied tribalism, and more range-tied tribalism. Most recently, LaBianca (1999) has expanded his and Younker's previous work and proposed several hypotheses summarizing the essential features of such kingdoms. The key points are: * Land-tied and range-tied agriculture coexisted, and a large pastoral nomadic component was always present, the proportions varying from village to village. * Tribal affiliations were based on the manipula- tion of generative genealogies enabling them to affiliate and coalesce with other groups. * Tribal social structure continued under kings. Tribes accommodated the supratribal monarchy through increasingly wide-ranging bonds of co- operation and allegiance. * Tribal hinterlands were administered from for- tified towns. * Most people lived in the rural hinterland. * Power structures were heterarchical, not hier- archical, i.e., there were several political cen- ters in each kingdom whose power was based on different resources. * Territorial units overlapped. * Militias were maintained to protect the interests of each tribal kingdom. It is proposed that the complex ceramic variations in Edom and the Negev, and the links between the two areas, can be explained within this tribal frame- work. The next section utilizes ethnographic data from the 19th century, covering southern Jordan and the Negev, to investigate how this framework may have functioned in practice in a later period, and how different tribes interacted with one another and externally. This detailed picture has many parallels with precisely the same area in the late Iron Age, with different tribal groups involved in trading ac- tivities and raids, close relationships with towns, and nominal responsibility to governors reporting to a faraway central government, in this case the Otto- man empire. The use of ethnographic analogies to reconstruct ancient societies has its dangers. Ancient societies were different in many ways from modern ones. Therefore, to make a valid comparison that adds to our knowledge of how those societies functioned, it is essential to make a distinction between behavior that is related to modern society and concepts, and behavior that is timeless and based on unchanging, Darwinian motives. These motives are production and procurement of food, protection against enemies and against nature, and acquiring status and power (Wilson 1975: 547-76). The economic strategies a tribal society resorts to can vary within a continuum that involves complete settlement at one end, and complete mobility at the other (Salzman 1980). Within those extremes almost any economic activity is possible, be it pastoralism, agriculture, robbing and raiding, protection, or trade, provided that it is profitable within the specific circumstances that make up the economical or ecological niche of the moment. This conforms to what LaBianca (1990: 13-14) has described as a "resilient system," which functioned within the Hesban region in the Iron Age, as reflected in the archaeological record. ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA FROM THE 19TH CENTURY The purpose of this section is to provide a de- tailed picture of how southern Jordan and the Negev were used by tribal societies in a period for which we have considerable written evidence. From this evidence, a model can be formulated based on core activities which do not appear to change over time. This model can then be applied to other periods, in this instance the late Iron Age, in an attempt to ap- proach those periods from a fresh perspective. Much information about society and the political and economic situation in the 19th century A.D. can be found in the numerous accounts written by trav- elers, mostly European. John Lewis Burckhardt trav- eled widely in Edom and the Sinai (Burckhardt 1822) and also wrote a study on the Bedouin and the Wahabis, showing profound insight into Bedouin life, economy, and political structure (Burckhardt 1830). Seetzen (1854), van de Velde (1854), and Stanley (1856) also made extensive notes about their travels in the region. Oppenheim's (1943) study of the his- tory, traditions, and economy of the tribes provides much useful information.</page><page sequence="10">30 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 BEDOUIN TRIBAL CONFEDERATIONS SINAI AND THE NEGEV (19TH TO EARLY 20TH CENTURY) Hebron Gaza Mediterranean Sea TI YAHA Beersheba \ TARABIN Karak Negev T A R A -IN1.

In practice, however, Ottoman control did not ex- tend south of Karak to the east and Hebron to the west. Edom and the Negev were effectively Bedouin territory. The main importance of this area for the govern- ment was that both the Egyptian and the Syrian hajj routes (pilgrimage routes to Mecca) went through it, one through Sinai, via Gaza and through the Negev, the other through Edom, both coming together at Aqaba. The government negotiated with the Bedouin tribes to protect the route. Pilgrims paid heavy taxes for protection and had to buy food on the way from Bedouin traders, often at exorbitant prices. At the end of the 18th century, the religious sect of the Wahabis had virtually taken over the entire south of the Syrian province and the Hijaz. In 1815 Mohammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt, set out to subdue the Wahabis. He, and later his son Ibrahim Pasha, managed to curb their power but then continued north as far as Aleppo, challenging the Ottoman empire itself. Eventually they were driven back to Egypt by forces from England and Russia. However, these wars, together with the economic involvement of the leading European powers, brought about an internal reform within the Ottoman government. New laws were created, partly based on European legal systems, with the purpose of improv- ing the administration and facilitating the collection of taxes. The Ottomans now attempted to involve the Bedouin tribes in government. The economy was also reformed; although it remained largely rural, a market economy was created, producing tradable goods such as cotton and silk. The Tribal Groupings During the 19th and early 20th centuries there were a number of major tribal confederations in the area, with whom smaller, independent tribes allied themselves. Alliances were far from stable: they could easily be created and just as easily change (Hillelson 1937; 1938; Marx 1967: 61-62). The main tribal confederation in the territory of Edom in the 19th century was the Huwaytat, from Karak in the north to south of Aqaba. Their winter quarters could, however, be as far north as the Ghor and as far east as the Wadi Sirhan. Partly because of their involvement in the camel trade and the Egyp- tian hajj, they could be found in southern Transjor- dan, Egypt, and Sinai (Oppenheim 1943: 291). They had burial grounds in the eastern Negev, traded with Gaza, and in times of drought lived around Gaza and Hebron. Their main enemy was the Beni Sakhr in the north, with whom they were at continual war. Other tribes in Edom paid tribute to the Huwaytat and fell under their protection. The Huwaytat built strongholds in the towns under their protection and appointed a sheikh of their own choice, in this way keeping control of these tribes (Burckhardt 1822: 403, 407). The Tiaha derived their name from the el-Tih pla- teau in Sinai, but most moved north into the Negev during the 19th century (Hirschfeld 1986). In the 19th century their territory was a crescent north of Beersheba. The Tarabin were the main tribal confed- eration in the Palestine-Egyptian border area, with Gaza as their main economic and political center. The CAzazmah were once one of the strongest con- federations in Sinai, but territorial fights lost them their hegemony and by the mid-19th century they were weak and localized south of Beersheba. The Towara were the Bedouin of el-Tor. At the beginning of the 19th century they attempted to take over the Suez-Cairo transports from the Ma'aze, which led to conflicts. Mohammad Ali used them to protect the southern Sinai route. The grave of Sheikh Saleh, their patriarch, located in the Wadi esh-Sheikh, was a gathering place for different tribes where annual feasts were held. Sources of Income Pastoralism. Most of the tribes were at least partly pastoralist, with herds of sheep, goat, and camels, even when some of them had actually set- tled and become fellaheen or found other means of livelihood (e.g., Burckhardt 1822: 406). In winter and early spring, pasturage was not a problem, but the rest of the year tribes had to negotiate and often fight over the best pasture land. The importance of coalitions was partly related to access to pasture grounds. Many different tribes annually visited fa- vorite pasture grounds, like the Wadi Fidan and the area around Beersheba (van de Velde 1854: 151; Marx 1967: 10; Burckhardt 1822: 410-13). Agriculture. Agriculture in Edom was largely trade-oriented. Fruit, vegetables, and tobacco were traded with Gaza and Hebron, and sold to the Syrian</page><page sequence="12">32 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 hajj pilgrims. Most of the tribes living in Edom were to some extent involved in agriculture, under the protection of the Huwaytat (Burckhardt 1822: 416). Towns such as Dana and Tafila were surrounded by gardens and orchards. The settled population culti- vated the area, exchanged fruit with the Bedouin, and sold it as far as Hebron. Dana was well known for its tobacco plantations (Burckhardt 1822: 410). Largely nomadic groups like the Huwaytat, the Uhewat, and the Towara owned large palm groves along the Red Sea coast (Oppenheim 1943). Around Gaza the situation was somewhat differ- ent. There were also large areas cultivated by differ- ent tribes under the protection of the Tarabin, but Gaza was a large town, a main port, and one of the starting points of the hajj. Agriculture here seems largely to have served the local population, as well as providing the pilgrims with their first provisions. Agriculture around Hebron consisted mainly of wheat and olives, which were traded with the Be- douin. In the second half of the 19th century, culti- vation by fellaheen under the protection of the major tribes was gradually replaced by sharecropping (Marx 1967: 75), but in practice the difference was proba- bly minimal. Agriculture around Beersheba always remained scattered and patchy, until the government built an administrative center there in 1903 (Ben-David 1990). Van de Velde, in 1851, found it was impos- sible to obtain any wheat or grain in Beersheba, because it was still part of the "wilderness." Never- theless, upon arriving in Beersheba, he noticed the remains of small-scale agriculture, as well as thresh- ing floors within the ruins (van de Velde 1854: 160- 62). This type of agriculture, in wadis or near springs, was found all over the Negev. However, these were essentially small patches for the subsistence of the Bedouin families who cultivated them, on a com- pletely different scale from the large-scale agricul- ture found around Gaza and in Edom. Trade. Trade in the 19th century was largely dictated by the two hajj routes running through the area: the Egyptian hajj, starting in Cairo, with a separate branch that started in Gaza and joined the main branch in Nakhl; and the Syrian hajj, starting in Damascus, and passing through Edom. The two routes met in Aqaba. They served the pilgrims once a year on their way to Mecca and were used as regu- lar trade routes during the remainder of the year. Another route went straight from Gaza to MaDan, via Shobak (Burckhardt 1822: 437; Smith 1896: 182). The nature of the trade conducted along these routes was defined by the pilgrimage, and a large part of this trade consisted of provisions and means of transport for the pilgrimage. In Edom part of the produce was sold directly to the pilgrims of the Syr- ian hajj when they passed through, or was brought to the waystation in Ma'an. Part of it was exported to the different waystations along both routes, such as Aqaba, Cairo, Gaza, and Nakhl, or to Hebron. When the Wahabis took over the region, the hajj was virtually stopped. This resulted in a serious loss of income for the smaller tribes such as the Djowabere of Tafila, the Lyathene of Wadi Musa, and others, and a deterioration of settlement in the region. Burckhardt feared that the town of Ma'an, which was almost completely dependent on the hajj trade, would be deserted in a few years (Burckhardt 1822: 436). Regular trade, in camels, tobacco, and other goods, was conducted with Gaza, Hebron, Aqaba, and Cairo, as well as with the Hauran. Soap-ash, collected and produced by the Bedouin of the moun- tains of Sherah, south of Wadi Fidan, was sold in Gaza. Gaza and Cairo provided the Bedouin with im- ported and luxury products such as cloth, weapons, and pottery (Smith 1896: 181). Coffee was trans- ported from places such as Mocha to Cairo via the Egyptian hajj road. Sometimes burial places of venerated sheikhs de- veloped into marketplaces. Near Salt, the tomb of Osha, a local saint, became a place for an annual pil- grimage as well as a fair. The Beni Sakhr sold soap- ash here, bought by merchants from Nablus. This trade was taxed by the chief of the Adwan and by the city of Salt itself (Burckhardt 1822: 354). Stan- ley (1856: 54) describes a similar development in the Wadi esh-Sheikh in south Sinai, where once a year all the tribes of the desert assembled around the grave of Sheikh Saleh, the traditional patriarch of the Huwaytat and the Towara, organizing a fair with races and dancing. The organization of trade was almost completely in the hands of the Bedouin. The Huwaytat traded with Cairo, making extra profit from their task as carriers of the Egyptian hajj. Every year through- out the 19th century, they drove a herd numbering 4,000 camels from Sherah to Cairo, only interrupted during the period between Napoleon's conquest of Egypt and the reign of Mohammad Ali, when the Huwaytat moved their trade to Damascus instead of Cairo. Trade with the Hauran was mainly conducted by the Sherarat, who also traded with Gaza. The</page><page sequence="13">2001 TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS: THE LATE IRON AGE 33 trade with Hebron was organized by merchants from Hebron who lived in Shobak. Raiding and Robbing. The world of the Bedouin was based on the principle of survival of the fittest. It consisted of the tribe and those bonded or allied to them: everyone else was considered an enemy. Raiding and robbing one's enemies was perfectly ac- ceptable, as a display of strength as well as a source of income. Therefore ghazus were regularly under- taken on other tribes, with the sole purpose of rob- bing each other's sheep, goats, and camels. In 1811 the Beni Sakhr robbed the Huwaytat of 1,200 camels (Burckhardt 1822: 413). The inhabitants of Dana and Busayra in Edom regularly stole each other's cattle (Burckhardt 1822: 410; also Bell 1907: 65). Raiding of villages, trade caravans, and travelers was also justified, especially as this took place in the tribe's territory. It could be bought off by paying pro- tection, khawa (literally "brotherhood"). By paying protection one became bonded to the tribe. If it was not paid, the Bedouin effectively stripped the vil- lages or trade caravans of everything worth taking. Even the hajj was not exempt: in 1802, when the Egyptian government refused to pay the Huwaytat for their job as carriers, they responded by robbing an Egyptian trade caravan of several thousand camel- loads of coffee. Some tribes from the Beersheba area raided as far as Upper Egypt and Mada'in Saleh in Arabia, and even owned land in Egypt (Hillelson 1937: 246). Protection. Protection was a source of income that the Bedouin developed very successfully. It was directly related to the (flexible) concept of territory. Boundaries were rarely marked, and areas with an abundance of springs and wells were shared by a number of tribes as camping and pasture grounds. The area around Beersheba in the 18th and 19th cen- turies was shared and sometimes disputed among Uhedat, CAzazmah, Hanajera, Tiaha, Zullam, and Tarabin (Oppenheim 1943: s.v. under the headings of each tribe). There were different forms of protection. First, there was protection of the hajj route. The right of the tribes to "protect" a certain stretch of the route was granted, or perhaps acknowledged, by the Pa- shas of Cairo and Damascus. The Huwaytat (Ben Jazi tribe) had the right to protect the hajj between Ma'an and Tebuq, and later the railway between Ma'an and Qatrana. The Tiaha protected the Egyp- tian hajj route between Jebel Husn and Nakhl, in return for a percentage of the goods traded on the market of Nakhl (Oppenheim 1943: 147). The pro- tection fee was paid by the pilgrims. Second, there was protection paid by trade cara- vans and travelers. Travelers through the region had to place themselves under the protection of the tribe or tribes that considered that region their terri- tory. This was done by hiring a "guide," usually a member of the leading family of the main tribe of the area. The fee paid for the guide was the protec- tion fee (among others, Burckhardt 1822: 378; Bell 1907: 27). That this was an important source of in- come for the Bedouin is demonstrated by the numer- ous fights that arose over the protection of certain roads, such as the pilgrim's route to St. Catherine's on Jabal Musa (Oppenheim 1943: 157), or the Suez- Cairo road. Tribes also paid protection to each other for the right to pass through each other's territory or use each other's wells. The Sherarat, who traded with the Hauran and Gaza, paid tribute to the Anaze, the Beni Sakhr, and several other tribes to pass through their territories. Finally, there was the khawa paid by fellaheen and villages to prevent being robbed of their harvest. This kind of protection was most often violated by the Bedouin, or made so high that the fellaheen could not manage to pay it, giving the Bedouin an excuse to rob them. The fellaheen often had to pay khawa to more than one tribe. The inhabitants of Jebal, for example, paid tribute to the Beni Hedjaja, the Szaleyt, and the Huwaytat (Burckhardt 1822: 403). A related example is the Jabahyah tribe, charged by Justinian in the sixth century A.D. to eter- nally protect the Monastery of St. Catherine in Sinai; between the 14th and 19th centuries the mon- astery records show that they also sometimes pil- laged the monastery (Bailey 1985: 34). Other Sources of Income. The Huwaytat were the carriers for the Egyptian hajj, as the Anaze were the carriers for the Syrian hajj. These were poten- tially profitable jobs, provided by the government. Another source of income was horse-breeding, for which the Sewaraka and the Rumeilat were famous. Other occupations of the Bedouin were production of soap from soap-ash, sold in Gaza and Hebron, and production of charcoal. According to Stanley, vegetation in Sinai had virtually disappeared be- cause of the production of charcoal from the acacias. In 1823 Mohammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt, compelled the Bedouin to pay tribute in charcoal for an assault committed on the Mecca caravan (Stanley 1865: 25).</page><page sequence="14">34 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 Relations with Cities Gaza was the frontier city of Syria and the desert for the southwest, as Damascus was for the north- east (Stanley 1856: 257). It was a central market- place for the Bedouin, attracting traders from Egypt, and one of the starting points of the hajj. Already by the 17th century, some tribes were being paid not to obstruct the route to Gaza (Bailey 1985: 28). Throughout the 19th century Gaza was unwalled, a cluster of villages within olive groves and cultivated fields. The population included settled Bedouin in- volved in agriculture and trade (van de Velde 1854: 180; Porter 1891: 204; Smith 1896: 181). In the 19th century Hebron was surrounded by cultivated gardens and fields with wheat, olives, figs, cherry trees, and vineyards (Seetzen 1854: 44; van de Velde 1854: 89; Stanley 1856: 99; Smith 1896: 318). The town had some industry-soap and glass-and a lively market. It was a central point for a number of trade routes, to Gaza to provide the Egyptian market, through the Negev direct to the Egyptian hajj route, and to Edom, where Hebron merchants were stationed. This trade was controlled by the Bedouin, who provided the camels neces- sary for it. There were several tribes living in the area, such as the Sowakera, Jehalin, and Ka'abene. Occasionally the Huwaytat, Tarabin, and Tiaha also camped around Hebron. Beersheba in the 19th century was a ruined town, a camping ground for many tribes because of its nu- merous wells and general fertility. The Tiaha, Tara- bin, CAzazmah, and Jehalin were the major tribes in the area (Hillelson 1937; 1938). The Ottoman gov- ernment, realizing the importance of Beersheba as a central place for the Bedouin tribes, and wanting to assert some sort of control, established an adminis- trative center there in 1903, with a court to solve land conflicts among the Bedouin, and a school for Bedouin children (Marx 1967: 32; Gerber 1986). After that the area became progressively more cul- tivated and inhabited, and eventually Beersheba de- veloped into a desert town, the so-called capital of the Negev. Relations with the Government The Ottoman government always maintained re- lations with the Bedouin tribes, with some excep- tions, such as the Beni Sakhr, who were at continual war with the government. Nevertheless, the area south of Hebron and Karak was virtually outside the government's control. Between 1831 and 1840 Ibra- him Pasha attempted to integrate the Bedouin into his administration, but this led to unrest and a revolt in 1834, starting from Hebron and Nablus, involv- ing all the tribes in the area. The towns were somewhat easier to control, espe- cially those at the beginning and end of the trade routes. In Gaza and Hebron the government had in- stalled a governor, to ensure the safety of travelers and keep a grip on the trade and its profits. The Ottoman government's main interest in keeping re- lations with the Bedouin was always control of the hajj and of the trade. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Otto- man government made a serious effort to involve the Bedouin in the government, in a deliberate at- tempt at integration instead of conflict. Administra- tive units were redefined, taxes centralized, and in 1858 the Land Laws were imposed, giving the tribes ownership of their actual or presumed terri- tory (Findley 1986; Hourani 1991: 287-90). Since sheikhs were now responsible for the collection of taxes, they were irresistibly drawn into the govern- ment (Akarli 1986). One of the Tarabin sheikhs held the post of head of the Beersheba municipality under the Ottoman administration, but was also im- prisoned by them (Hillelson 1937: 244). Roman and Byzantine Parallels A similar situation apparently already existed in Roman and Byzantine times in the same area, where various Arab tribes interacted with the imperial gov- ernment, controlling defense and trade in certain ar- eas. Although the evidence is only referred to briefly here, it is important to demonstrate that the patterns seen in the 19th century were already in existence in Roman-Byzantine times. It was regular Roman, and later Byzantine, policy to establish treaties with the tribes to help ensure peace. From at least the second until the early seventh century A.D., tribes were enlisted and sub- sidized as foederati in exchange for serving as a defense against invaders, controlling disturbances by other tribes, and refraining from raiding the prov- ince themselves (see Graf 1978: 5 for overview). The Nessana papyri, dating to the sixth and sev- enth centuries A.D., reflect a system virtually identi- cal to that of the 19th century (Kraemer 1958). Several papyri cite the presence of nomadic tribes</page><page sequence="15">2001 TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS: THE LATE IRON AGE 35 camping on the fringes of the agricultural lands (cf. Avni 1996: 78-84; Banning 1986). Nomads or peo- ple of nomadic origin were involved in the govern- ment of towns in the Negev, participating in military and civil tasks, and engaged in herding and trading, seasonal agriculture, and escort and courier services. Trading caravans paid for Bedouin escorts through tribal territories when traveling between the Negev and Sinai. Nessana Papyrus 89, for example, is a partial account of income and expenditure of a car- avan of travelers from the Negev to southern Sinai and back. One of the expenditures is a payment to a Bedouin guide (or a Saracen tribal chief through whose territory the caravan passed). On the return journey, the traders lost a camel, which was recov- ered by the Bedouin and held for ransom (Kraemer 1958: no. 89; Avni 1996: 78). INTERACTING TRIBES AND TRADE: DEVELOPING A NEW MODEL The evidence presented above shows that tribal groups in southern Jordan and the Negev undertook similar patterns of activities in the Roman-Byzan- tine period and in the 19th century. Essentially, for whichever period we have detailed written evidence for tribal activities in this area, the same patterns recur. It is therefore possible to analyze this evidence to develop a model for a system of interacting tribal groups involved in trade in southern Jordan and the Negev. This model is based on five basic recurring aspects-territory and movement, trade, interaction with a gateway town, relationship to central govern- ment, and relationship with an imperial power- which are not exclusive to any one period but which can be applied to any period. 1. Territory and movement. There are several main tribal groupings, with different core areas, but they move, overlap, have contact with one another, share resources, and have arrange- ments for crossing one another's territories. 2. Trade. Some of these tribes control the trade between Edom and the main port on the Med- iterranean coast. However, these same tribes sometimes raid and rob this same trade. 3. Interaction with a gateway town. The tribes have links with the main port, but particularly close links with an intermediate town, which acts as a gathering place and a kind of gate- way to the outside world. 4. Relationship to central government. While nominally under the control of a "central" government, in practice these tribes are inde- pendent. Their affiliation or "ethnicity" is to kin groups within the tribe, not to the state. 5. Relationship with an imperial power. An im- perial power will try but fail to conquer the tribes by force. It will then attempt to control the tribes through integration and by provid- ing services, thus creating a mutually depen- dent relationship in which both parties profit. It will control key towns, especially those at the beginning or end of the trade route. This generic model can now be applied to the evidence in exactly the same area-Edom and the Negev-in the late Iron Age, to test if a similar sys- tem was in operation in that period. Territory and Movement Is there written evidence for different "tribal" groupings in the late Iron Age? The so-called Edomite king list in Gen 36:31-39 can be inter- preted as a list of tribal chiefs each connected with a different place, although it is more likely that the list is artificial and combines names from both Edom and Moab edited together in the eighth-seventh century B.C. (Bartlett 1989: 94-102) or in the Per- sian period (Knauf 1985). Other "tribal statistics" in Genesis 36 have been dated to the seventh century B.C., and Knauf (1992: 52) notes that the tribal struc- ture survived throughout the Iron Age, the same clan (Manahath b. Sobal) being listed in both Gen 36:23 and in the postexilic list 1 Chr 2:50-54. Psalm 83:6 depicts an alliance of sedentary and nonsedentary peoples against Israel, headed by "the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites," implying to Lindsay (1976: 38) some sort of contact or coalition over a wide area, into northwest Arabia. The Mesha Inscription of the ninth century B.C. refers to the settling of different named groups in Moab. Lines 12-14 record that after the defeat of the city of CAtarot, the Moabite king "brought in people from Sharon and Maharit to live in the area," who Dearman (1992: 73) concludes were essentially pastoralists (cf. also Dearman 1989: 189-96; Rout- ledge 2000 stresses that the Mesha Inscription refers to territorial divisions rather than kinship groups, but the two are not mutually exclusive). The Qedar- ite tribal confederation is first attested in Arabia</page><page sequence="16">36 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 and Transjordan in the time of Tiglath-pileser III, was active against Ashurbanipal, and became more prominent from southern Syria to Egypt and Arabia in the Persian period (Eph'al 1984: 223-27; Knauf 1989: 96-108). The Assyrian texts refer to many different Arab tribes in the Negev region (cf. Eph'al 1984: 215-30). For Edom, it has been suggested above that the different pottery assemblages are partly regional and partly due to site location (especially the moun- taintop sites in the Petra region which lack painted pottery), perhaps implying relatively separate, iso- lated communities. In the Negev, and at Tell el- Kheleifeh, there is mixture and variety in the pottery assemblages: "Edomite" pottery, Judaean pottery, coastal pottery, handmade Negev ware, Egyptian pottery, Qurayya painted ware, and the occasional sherd of Cypro-Phoenician and East Greek pottery (see fig. 2). This seems to reflect a mix and overlap of groups from north, south, east, and west, with their characteristic pottery-although mostly locally made-distributed (and produced) well beyond what might be regarded as their "core" areas.13 An explanation for this is that these groups are moving around the area, crossing one another's territories, and interacting with one another at certain sites; they probably had grazing grounds and engaged in small-scale agriculture in the vicinity of these sites, where they perhaps had semi-permanent or seasonal camps. It is not suggested that purely nomadic pas- toralists were producing all this pottery, especially the fine painted wares: these tribal groups were en- gaged in both land and pastoral agriculture, a situa- tion certainly known among the Bedouin in the 19th century. Tribal "ideology" accommodated both sed- entary and nomadic lifestyles (LaBianca 1999: 20).14 That there was a significant pastoral nomadic com- ponent in Edom throughout the Iron Age, perhaps also connected with copper working, is suggested by the results of the Wadi Fidan survey (Homan, Adams, and Levy in press). Of 24 Iron Age sites, only one appeared to be a permanent settlement; furthermore, the majority of sites were related to copper metallurgy, often with hundreds of small smelting furnaces.15 The Wadi Fidan was a favorite pasture ground in the 19th century (see above), and this may have been the case already in the Iron Age. It is likely that there were key crossing points of the Wadi Arabah between the Wadis Faynan/Fidan and Busayra (probably via Wadi Dahal) on the east, and CEn Haseva on the west (Harel 1959; see n. 16). At this point the Wadi Arabah is almost at its nar- rowest, at approximately 10 km wide, and forms an ideal, level, easy route, combined with the rich wa- ter resources of cEn Haseva and the Wadi Fidan, whereas immediately to the north and south its to- pography changes, making crossing more difficult. The presence of a smelting site at Givat Haseva, and of "Edomite" pottery there and at cEn Haseva, also suggests links with the Faynan/Fidan area and Busayra. Trade Singer-Avitz (1999) has argued that already in the eighth century B.C. there was a trade route from Arabia via Edom (Busayra), to cEn Haseva, and through the Beersheba Valley, via Malhata, Aroer, 13 It may be significant that such a mixture of "stan- dard" Iron Age pottery, Qurayya painted ware, and Ne- gev ware is already found in the ninth century B.C. at Barqa el-Hetiye, the earliest Iron Age settlement in Edom so far known, together with Khirbat en-Nahas (Fritz 1994; cf. n. 2). 14 How, where, by, and for whom these mixtures of pottery were produced is acknowledged as the critical point in the proposed model. The evidence from Malhata, noted above, perhaps provides some insight: local Negev clay is used for both Judaean and Edomite pottery, but different fabrics are used for the Judaean and Edomite cooking pots, the latter from an apparently nonlocal clay (for the different cooking pot types, see fig. 2:11-12). Cooking pots, particularly indicative of cultural groups, are usually a specialized production, requiring special clay and temper (Franken 1969: 119-30; London 1991: 405; Vilders 1993: 155). While "Judaean" and "Edomite" groups at Malhata might be able to produce their charac- teristic pottery from local clays, cooking pots or the dis- tinctive clays to produce them might need to be brought from elsewhere (see n. 9). Haiman and Goren (1992) have proposed that "Negbite" pottery, or Negev ware, found from Early Bronze II up to Islamic-period sites, was produced by nomadic pastoralists, perhaps season- ally (for Iron II Negev ware, see fig. 2:9-10). 15 Perhaps an analogous situation existed at the end of the Late Bronze Age in the Timna area, farther south along the Wadi Arabah, where mixtures of Negev ware, Qurayya painted ware, and Egyptian New Kingdom ves- sels are found at sites used for smelting, habitation, and storage (Rothenberg 1999).</page><page sequence="17">2001 TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS: THE LATE IRON AGE 37 Tel cIra, and Beersheba, and to Gaza on the coast.16 This premise is based on the mixture of pottery types in the Beersheba Stratum II assemblage, which has vessels characteristic of Judah, the coast, Edom, Assyria, and Egypt, and some objects showing Arabian influence. The Arabian trade was certainly fully active by the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. (Groom 1981) and was probably carried along much the same route (Knauf-Belleri 1995: 114; Finkel- stein 1995: 152-53), with Malhata perhaps taking on the role of the major "gateway" community after the destruction of Beersheba in 701 B.C. (see below). The mixtures of pottery at the Negev sites, in- cluding Negev ware and Qurayya painted ware, and occasional ostraca written in "Hebrew" or "Edo- mite" script (see Beit-Arieh 1995b), suggest that at least some of the Iron Age tribal groups were con- ducting the trade between Arabia, Edom, the Beer- sheba Valley, and Gaza. Certainly for the Persian period, the account of Herodotus makes it quite clear that the conduct of the Arabian trade was in the hands of Arab tribes (cf. Eph'al 1984: 192-210). Some of these tribal groups may also have been raiding the trade: this could well be the context of Arad Ostracon 24, often cited in support of Judaean military deployment against an Edomite attack (e.g., Aharoni 1981: 150; Beit-Arieh 1995b: 35). The text, dated by Aharoni to 598/597 B.C., orders troops from Arad and Qinah to Ramath-negeb "lest anything should happen to the city" and "lest Edom should come there" (Aharoni 1981: 46, no. 24). This could be interpreted as an anticipation of an attack on a trade caravan or town by one of the tribal groups from the east, especially if Ramath-negeb is iden- tified with Tel cIra, one of the key sites in the Beer- sheba Valley on the Arabian trade route (as proposed by Lemaire 1977: 191-92; Na'aman 1980: 146; for other identifications, see Beit-Arieh 1999: 15). Interaction with a Gateway Town For the eighth century B.C., Singer-Avitz (1999) has proposed that Beersheba Stratum II functioned as a gateway town on the trade route between Ara- bia, Edom, and Gaza. The wide variety of finds and foreign influences suggests that it supplied services and served as a waystation along the route to Gaza, rather than being a destination market (Singer-Avitz 1999: 60). In the 19th century, Beersheba was a favorite pasture ground for Bedouin, and this may already have been the case in the Iron Age. After Beersheba's destruction in 701 B.C., many of the sites along the Beersheba Valley continued to func- tion in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. and yield a similar variety of pottery. The large fortified site of Malhata, with its mixture of Judaean, "Edomite/ Assyrian," and East Greek pottery (Kochavi 1993; Beit-Arieh 1998), is regarded as a central city in the eastern Negev in the seventh century B.C. (Beit- Arieh 1995b: 37) and might be considered as a simi- lar gathering point for a number of groups and a gateway town for the Arabian trade. The "fortress" at Tell el-Kheleifeh too might have been an equivalent gateway town on the Gulf of Aqaba (but see n. 8 and Mussell 1999). The mixture there of Edomite pottery, Negev ware, Qurayya painted ware, Greek, Arabian, and Egyptian pottery and other objects is also suggestive of a gathering place (Glueck 1993: 869; Pratico 1993), perhaps precisely at the point where a land route from Ara- bia comes up the Red Sea coast. For a later period, Strabo (Geography 16.4.23-24) and the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (para. 19; Schoff 1912; Hunting- ford 1980) mention a land (camel) route for Arabian spices from Leuke Kome, a Nabataean port some- where on the Red Sea coast, all the way to Petra, and Tell el-Kheleifeh lies on that route (see Eph'al 1984: 14-17; for other routes, see Van Beek 1960: 75-82). 16 The most direct route from CEn Haseva to the Beer- sheba Valley is northwest through Macaleh CAqrabbim, the so-called Scorpions' Ascent, toward Aroer and Mal- hata. Although there is no evidence of earlier use, the Roman-Byzantine road appears to have been the most convenient route between the Gulf of Aqaba and Gaza, in preference to two alternative routes (Harel 1959). The Macaleh CAqrabbim route requires an ascent of 350 m, but after that it passes through an easy plateau via Beer- sheba. Eastward, the Roman road from CEn Haseva went up the Wadi Dahal to the vicinity of Busayra and merged with the Via Nova Traiana (Finkelstein 1979: 31); there is some evidence for the use of the Wadi Dahal as a route in the Iron II period (MacDonald 1992: 76-79). Despite the lack of hard evidence from Macaleh CAqrabbim, it is possible that this same route was in operation in the Iron Age, linking Tell el-Kheleifeh on the Gulf of Aqaba, Busayra, CEn Haseva, Macaleh CAqrabbim, the Beersheba Valley, and Gaza. There was probably a separate crossing of the Wadi Arabah between the Wadi Fidan (which leads directly to the Wadi Faynan copper area) and CEn Haseva (cf. Hauptmann 2000: 90).</page><page sequence="18">38 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 The shrines at CEn Haseva and Horvat Qitmit are most likely characteristic of Negev tribal groups, but show evidence of use by other groups, perhaps as gathering places for shared worship (see above; Finkelstein 1995: 149-52). In this sense, perhaps they can be regarded as "tribal league sanctuaries" known from other contexts, also located along major trade routes where crossing of territory must be ne- gotiated or intertribal arrangements are formalized. A later example is the Rawwafa sanctuary in Saudi Arabia, dating to the second century A.D., located on a major Nabataean trade route. This was a central shrine and intertribal meeting place for the Tha- mudic confederation; the intersection of the tribal area by the trade route necessitated negotiations of treaties or agreements with the local tribes by cara- vans passing through their territory (Graf 1978: 11). Finkelstein (1995: 149-51) suggests a similar func- tion for Kuntillet CAjrud (ca. 800 B.C.), as a com- bined cult place and waystation connected with the southern trade controlled by the desert tribes. Relationship to Central Government The evidence from Edom suggests little central- ized control from the major administrative and reli- gious center, Busayra, bearing out LaBianca and Younker's (1995: 406) hypothesis that supratribal organization in Edom was at a lower level than in Moab and especially Ammon. The quality and na- ture of the architecture and pottery at Busayra con- stitute an exception, and pottery assemblages and architecture at other sites, essentially open villages and farmsteads, show huge variety (see above; Bien- kowski 1995: 56-58). This dichotomy has been in- terpreted in terms of an opposition between the state and the tribes, even to the extent of suggesting that the villagers were avoiding the state and its agents (Knauf 1992: 52). Knauf (in Lindner et al. 1996: 162) speculates that each of the mountain strong- holds in the Petra region formed a "citadel" of an individual clan or tribe. In the Negev, technically under the rule of Judah, there is a mixture of Ju- daean and other pottery, and the material culture at the cEn Haseva and Horvat Qitmit shrines is not purely Judaean. The Assyrian texts refer to appar- ently stateless Arabs in the area (see above; Eph~al 1984: 215-30). The nature of tribal organization in the Near East, and particularly in Transjordan, has for millennia led individuals and households to regard themselves as members of a particular named kin group within a larger tribe, and not as citizens of a state (LaBi- anca and Younker 1995: 403-5). It is likely that Iron II Edom was composed of kin groups within tribes within tribal confederations, which had bonds of allegiance with a supratribal monarchy based in Busayra. There is no evidence that people identified themselves as members of this supratribal state: in Iron Age inscriptions, individuals do not refer to themselves as "Edomites" or "Moabites," and kings are kings of territories or states, Edom and Moab, not of peoples. "Edom" and "Moab" were already geographical terms in the Late Bronze Age (cf. Kitchen 1992: 26-29), adopted as names of political entities in the Iron Age. In the ninth century B.C., Mesha records his title as "king of Moab," but identifies himself as Dayboni, a Dibonite, after his place of residence (cf. LaBianca and Younker 1995: 408-9). Dearman (1992: 73) points out that re- gional and clan names are as frequent in the Mesha Inscription as references to a people and territory called Moab. By contrast, "Ammon" as the name of an area or state is not attested before the first millennium B.C. Its first definite appearance, as Bit Amman (Beth- Ammon), is in the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III, ca. 732 B.C. (Weippert 1987: 99).17 In their own inscriptions, Ammonite kings refer to themselves as "king of the bn Camn" (Bene Ammon, lit. "sons of Ammon") (Aufrecht 1989: no. 78, the Tell Siran bot- tle inscription, dated to the seventh century B.C.). Although "Bene Ammon" is typically translated broadly as "Ammonites," and so "king of the Am- monites," this loses the true meaning of the term. "Bene Ammon" is very suggestive of a tribal desig- nation, just like the Bedouin Ben Jazi of the Hu- waytat or the Beni Sakhr. It is more likely that "Bene Ammon" was originally the name of a tribe, rather than a place, "Ammon." This would also explain why the Assyrian inscriptions refer to Am- mon as "Bit Amman" ("the house of Ammon"), naming a real or legendary founder of the tribe, in parallel with the Assyrian designation of Israel as "Bit Humri" ("the house of Omri"), naming the 17 The Ammonites, under Ba'asha son of Ruhubi, may have taken part in the alliance against Shalmaneser III at the battle of Qarqar in 853 B.c., although Weippert (1987: 98) thinks this may refer to a ruler in the Anti- Lebanon north of Damascus. See Millard 1992: 35 for discussion.</page><page sequence="19">2001 TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS: THE LATE IRON AGE 39 ninth-century B.C. king of Israel as the founder of the dynasty (see also Routledge 2000: 235 n. 45). In this sense, the modern concept of "ethnicity" is largely inapplicable to ancient tribal groups (cf. generally Jones 1997; Dever 1997). Using later par- allels, in the bilingual Greek and Nabataean inscrip- tion from Rawwafa, Saudi Arabia, the Greek text refers to the "Thamudic ethnos," that is, "the Tha- mudic people" or "nation," but the corresponding Nabataean text has the "Thamudic Sirkat," that is, the "Thamudic confederation" (Bowersock 1975; Graf 1978: 15). The lesson is that the tribal equiva- lent of "ethnicity" is tribal affiliation. Neverthe- less, there is also evidence that tribes could coa- lesce, or be part of a supratribal polity (LaBianca and Younker 1995: 405; essentially this is the pro- cess described in the Old Testament concerning the twelve tribes and the rise of the Israelite monarchy). Some Safaitic tribes seem to have been part of a heterogeneous population politically united under Nabataean hegemony (Graf 1989: 369). The author of one Safaitic text even appears to identify himself as "the Nabataean." Nevertheless, not all Safaitic tribes were Nabataean subjects-the CAwidh tribal confederation appears to have been punished by the Nabataean king on one occasion. From this perspective, it is pertinent to return to the question of the attribution of "Edomite pottery" (cf. Bienkowski 1992: 7; Finkelstein 1995: 140-41). Although it is still often regarded as an ethnic and political criterion denoting the presence of "Edo- mites," our understanding of the structure of the state and of society in the Iron Age strongly sug- gests that this pottery and its distribution are a geographical and cultural product, probably of tribal groups, which has no connection at all to our mod- em concept of ethnicity or to "the Edomite state." Put starkly, such pottery was probably produced by people who regarded themselves as members of par- ticular tribes, and not as "Edomites"; and it was pro- duced over a wide area, which was not necessarily contiguous with the (changing) borders of the state of Edom. Although modem maps tend to draw a political border between Iron Age Edom and Judah along the Wadi Arabah, the evidence suggests that the Arabah was not really a sharply defined border or an effec- tive barrier (Bartlett 1982; 1989: 37-44; Edelman 1995). It functioned much more as a route and a link, especially for tribal groups (see above). Indeed, some members of the tribal groups may even have been employed in the fortified towns in the Negev. Perhaps that is the interpretation of the ostracon from Horvat CUza, a Judaean fortress, sent by an in- dividual who uses the blessing "by Qos," the deity worshipped by the Edomites (Beit-Arieh and Cres- son 1985; for Qos, see Dearman 1995). Beit-Arieh and Cresson (1985: 99) interpret this ostracon as "an instruction issued by a high Edomite official to Blbl, apparently a high-ranking officer in an Edomite fort at CUza or elsewhere in the Negev, to supply a quan- tity of food." However, as Bartlett (1989: 222) has pointed out, the (restored) reference in the ostracon to lifting the delivered food onto an altar suggests a cultic rather than military context. Indeed, there is no reason to conclude that the sender was an Edomite official, rather than a member of a group who worshipped Qos, and who was responsible for food distribution at a Judaean fortress.18 Relationship with an Imperial Power Edom only ever paid tribute to Assyria, it was never turned into an Assyrian province, and there is no evidence for the actual presence of Assyrians in Edom, even at Busayra (Bienkowski 2000). The citadel buildings at Busayra have some similarities with Assyrian architecture, but such public buildings were common throughout the Levant and Mesopo- tamia in the late Iron Age and need not be ascribed directly to the Assyrians. The so-called assyrianizing pottery in Edom and the Negev is not true Assyrian palace ware, but a local imitation. Individual objects occasionally show traces of Assyrian influence, but in many cases the influence could be indirect, from elsewhere in the Levant. None of these examples implies an Assyrian presence in Edom or the Negev, and they are more likely selective borrowings. This contrasts with a series of sites between Beer- sheba and Gaza-Tell Jemmeh, Tel Serac, Tel Haror, Tell Abu Salima-which show clear evidence of Assyrian presence and building activity in the sev- enth century B.C. (summary in Finkelstein 1995: 147; Herr 1997: 167-68). Tell Jemmeh had a mud- brick barrel-vaulted building constructed using char- acteristic Assyrian techniques (Van Beek 1993). Tel Serac had two citadels with a mixture of Assyrian 18 Finkelstein (1995: 144) suggests that the sender of the Horvat CUza ostracon might have been a person of Edomite origin serving as a mercenary in a Judaean garrison.</page><page sequence="20">40 BIENKOWSKI AND VAN DER STEEN BASOR 323 palace ware and local imitations, Egyptian objects, "Edomite" and East Greek pottery, and Aramaic and Hebrew ostraca, suggesting that it was connected with the trade route. Tel Haror and Tell Abu Salima have also been identified as Assyrian forts or admin- istrative centers (see Finkelstein 1995: 147; Reich 1984). It is possible to interpret these sites as As- syrian administrative centers located precisely at the end of the Arabian trade route in order to guarantee Assyrian involvement. Assyrian interest in the trade through Gaza is attested from the time of Tiglath- pileser III's conquest, when he referred to it as "a custom-house of Assyria" (Na'aman 1979). The con- struction of Assyrian administrative centers in the seventh century B.C. should also be considered in the context of Sargon II's settlement of deported Arab tribes in the region south of Gaza and in Sinai, and Esarhaddon's reliance on these tribes during his in- vasion of Egypt (Eph'al 1984: 93-108, 137-42). Both Tiglath-pileser III and Sargon II appointed nomadic tribal leaders to supervise the Egyptian border (Eph'al 1984: 93-94). All of this suggests a deliberate Assyrian policy to integrate the tribes into the Assyrian administrative system (cf. Eph'al 1984: 93-111), especially the tribes in the key strategic areas at the end of the Arabian trade route and on the Egyptian border. In the Persian period, too, Arab tribes were involved in the imperial administration, running the spice trade, controlling the maritime emporia, and policing the Egyptian border (Eph'al 1984: 206-10). Another Persian parallel to the As- syrian approach comes in a fifth-century B.C. Lihya- nite text from the Hijaz mentioning "CAbd the governor of Dedan." The use of the term "governor" implies that the Qedarite tribal confederation acted as the agents of the Achaemenid administration in the Hijaz and elsewhere in north Arabia (Graf 1990: 47-48). CONCLUSION: TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS The starting point of this paper was the problem of the complexity of the late Iron II ceramic assem- blages in southern Jordan and the Negev. The mix- ture, at many sites, of different types of pottery of several "cultural" traditions is not explained ade- quately by current reconstructions, which identify them simplistically as "Edomite" and "Judaean" and interpret their presence as the result of hostile "Edomite" incursions into "Judaean" territory. Such reconstructions simply do not account for the com- plexity of the archaeological record, and a new explanation is required. This accepts as its overall theoretical framework that the social organization in these areas in late Iron II was essentially tribal and kin-based, partially range-tied and nomadic and partially land-tied and settled. This paper has attempted a new perspective on the late Iron II in southern Jordan and the Negev by developing a five-part model derived from written sources dating to the second-seventh and nineteenth centuries A.D. These sources provide a wealth of de- tail on tribal activities in the same area and reveal a recurring pattern of activities that cuts across chro- nological and political boundaries. Certain patterns of activities of tribal groups in southern Jordan and the Negev remained constant over the centuries: their concept of territory and the mechanics of movement across neighboring territories, their involvement in trade, and their interaction with towns, government, and imperial powers. Since such recurring patterns have been recognized, it is legitimate to apply this model to the late Iron II, where the contemporary written evidence is comparatively poor, to test if such a new perspective is more successful in explaining the complexities of the archaeological evidence. It is proposed that this model of interacting tribal groups involved in trade can be appropriately ap- plied to the late Iron Age in southern Jordan and the Negev, and the resulting new framework is summa- rized here. In the second millennium B.C. nonsettled pastoral nomadic groups occupied southern Jordan and much of the Negev. Between the twelfth and tenth centuries B.C. such groups resumed copper mining in the Faynan area, and their burials have been found, dated to the tenth-ninth centuries B.C., in the Wadi Fidan. By the ninth century B.C. some of these groups had settled in small mining camps in the Faynan area. By the late eighth century B.C., a combination of industrial-scale copper mining, the pax Assyriaca, and the Arabian trade had intensified settlement in Edom. Edom was by now an indepen- dent kingdom, with a major administrative and reli- gious center at Busayra, paying tribute to Assyria. But this was not a monolithic nation-state; it was a kingdom composed of largely independent tribal groupings held together by bonds of cooperation and allegiance to a supratribal monarchy, a combination of settled agricultural and pastoralist life, always a characteristic of this environment. These groups did not suddenly stop their pastoral migrations; they</page><page sequence="21">2001 TRIBES, TRADE, AND TOWNS: THE LATE IRON AGE 41 continued to move and interacted with other groups from Arabia, the Negev, and the west, especially in the fertile Beersheba Valley. Those groups were similarly largely independent of any centralized con- trol, for example by Judah, which claimed rule over some of their areas. These tribal groups controlled and sometimes raided the trade among Arabia, Edom, the Beersheba Valley, and Gaza. There were points of contact between them and the "civilized" world-for example, Beersheba in the eighth cen- tury B.C., which functioned as a gateway town on the Arabian trade route. In the seventh century B.C., Malhata and perhaps Tell el-Kheleifeh can be in- terpreted as similar gateway towns and gathering places for such groups, while Horvat Qitmit and CEn Haseva were local shrines along the trade route, used by a variety of groups. The characteristic pot- tery of these groups is found mixed together at the sites where they mingled, and much of it was prob- ably manufactured at these sites; here they probably had grazing grounds and engaged in small-scale agriculture. Tell Jemmeh, Tel Serac, Tel Haror, and Tell Abu Salima, between Beersheba and Gaza at the end of the Arabian trade route, may have been Assyrian administrative centers whose purpose was to control Assyrian interests in the Arabian trade and to integrate the tribes in the region of Gaza and in Sinai.
