STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS ARTICLES Submit five copies of the manuscript; be sure that they are good, clear copies and that all pages are included in each copy. The manuscript should be typed on standard size (81/2" x 11") paper, double-spaced throughout (including footnotes, references, quotations, and appendixes), on only one side of the paper, and with wide margins (one inch or more) at top, bottom, and both sides of each page. Manuscripts prepared on computers should be printed on letter quality printers or, if other printers are used, in double-strike or enhanced print. Footnotes, references, appendixes, tables, and figures should be on separate sheets of paper and should be arranged at the end of the manuscript in the order listed in this sentence. There is no absolute limit, but the length of articles should not ordinarily exceed 30 manuscript pages, including references, appendixes, tables, and figures. Title Page and Abstract The first page of the manuscript should include the title of the article (typed in all capital letters), the authors' names (typed in all capitals), and their affiliations, addresses, and phone numbers (typed with initial caps only). Example: THEORY CONSTRUCTION AS DISCIPLINED IMAGINATION KARL E. WEICK The University of Michigan Graduate School of Business Administration Ann Arbor, MI 43403 (419) 372-2687 No mention of authors' names should be made in the body of the paper, except where appropriate in citations and references. The second page, numbered page 2, should repeat the title and include an abstract of 75 or fewer words. The text of the article should begin on page 3. Page numbering should continue through all pages of the manu- script, including those with footnotes, references, appendixes, tables, and figures. Acknowledgments An unnumbered footnote can be used to acknowledge financial sup- port and/or assistance of others in preparing the manuscript. In the manu- script, the text for this footnote should appear at the bottom of the same page 173</page><page sequence="2">174 Academy of Management Review January as the abstract (page 2). It should be separated from the abstract by a 10-dash line beginning at the left-hand margin. Footnotes Other footnotes should be used sparingly. Minimize their use for par- enthetical discussion; material that is pertinent can often be integrated into the text. They should not be used for citing references (see References be- low). The text for all footnotes should appear on a separate page or pages at the end of the body of the article. Headings Main headings should be used to designate the major sections of the article; three or four main headings should be sufficient for most articles. Initial headings, such as "Introduction," are unnecessary. Main headings should be centered on the page and typed in all capitals. They should not be underlined. Example: DESCRIPTIONS OF THEORY CONSTRUCTION Secondary headings should be typed flush with the left margin and in small letters, with major words beginning with capitals. Secondary head- ings should not be underlined. Example: Previous Descriptions Third-order or paragraph headings should begin with a standard para- graph indention and be typed in capital and small letters, with only the initial word capitalized. Paragraph headings should be followed by a pe- riod; they should not be underlined. Example: That's connected. Crovitz (1970) developed the relational algorithm as a device to generate novel solutions.... The text should follow on the same line. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text; they supplement and clarify it. Because tables and figures are considerably more expensive to prepare for publication than text, the degree to which they add to the impact of the manuscript should be considered carefully. Tables should be typed, double-spaced, on separate pages (one page for each table) from the text. They should be grouped together following the appendixes. If there is no appendix, tables should follow the references. For most papers, the first table should report descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and a complete intercorrelation matrix. Each table should have the word TABLE (typed in all caps) and its number (arabic numerals) centered at the top. The table title should be in capital and small letters and centered on the page directly under the table number; it should not be underlined. Example:</page><page sequence="3">1993 Volume 18, Number 1 175 TABLE 1 Financial Imnpact of Profit Sharing Tables should be numbered consecutively from the beginning to the end of the article. The position of the table in the manuscript should be indicated in the text as follows: Insert Table 1 about here Footnotes to tables are of two types: (1) General footnotes that explain the table as a whole, the designa- tions of table columns or rows, or an individual item. All of these should be designated by superscript small letters (abc), with the footnotes for each separate table beginning with a. (2) Footnotes used to indicate the level of significance should follow any other footnotes and be designated by one or more asterisks: * for p &lt; .05, ** for p &lt; . 01, and for p &lt; .001. Use a dagger symbol (t) for p &lt; .10. Figures are any illustrations other than tables. Authors should be pre- pared to supply finished camera-ready artwork for all figures at the time the manuscript is accepted for publication. Unless the authors are highly skilled in graphics, a professional drafting service should be employed to prepare figures. The spacing and lettering used in figures should allow for subsequent reduction in size by as much as 50 percent so that the figure will fit the size of the Review's page. The original artwork for figures should not be sub- mitted until after the manuscript has been accepted for publication. Figures should be numbered consecutively with arabic numerals and their position in the text indicated as for tables (see above). Each figure should be presented on a separate page with FIGURE (typed in all caps) and its number centered above it and a short identifying title in capital and small letters centered underneath the figure number. Example: FIGURE 1 Relationship Between Expected Return and Risk Factor Insert Figure 1 about here References An alphabetically ordered list of references cited in the text should be included at the end of the article. References should begin on a separate page headed REFERENCES. Continue the pagination. Entries in the list of references should be alphabetized by the last name of the author (first author if more than one) or editor, or by the corporate author (U. S. Census Bureau) or periodical name (Wall Street Journal) if there is no indication of individual authors or editors. Several references</page><page sequence="4">176 Academy of Management Review January by an identical author (or group of authors) are ordered by year of publi- cation, with the earliest listed first. Multiple references to works by one author or group of authors with the same year of publication should be differentiated with the addition of small letters (a, b, etc.) after the year. Authors' names are repeated for each entry. Citations to references should be designated throughout the text by enclosing the authors' names and the year of the reference in parentheses. Example: Several studies (Adams, 1974; Brown &amp; Hales, 1975, 1980; Collins, 1976a,b) support this conclusion. Note the use of alphabetical order and an ampersand in citations. Page numbers must be included in a citation to provide the exact source of a direct quotation. Page numbers follow the date of publication given in parentheses and are separated from it by a colon. Example: Adams has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1974: 3). They should also be used when specific arguments or findings of authors are paraphrased or summarized. As indicated in the example, if the name of the author occurs in the body of the sentence, only the year of publication is cited in parentheses. Otherwise, both name and date appear in paren- theses, separated by a comma. If a work has two authors, always cite both names every time the work is cited in the text. If the work has more than two authors, cite all authors the first time the reference occurs; in subsequent citations of the same work, include only the surname of the first author followed by "et al." (not under- lined) and the year. Examples: Few field studies use random assignment (Franz, Johnson, &amp; Schmidt, 1976). (first citation) ... even when random assignment is not possible (Franz et al., 1976: 23). (subsequent citation) However, for works with six or more authors, use only the surname of the first author followed by et al. whenever the work is cited. Book entries in the list of references follow this form: Authors' or Editors' Last Names, Initials. Year. Title of book. (Book titles are underlined and typed in lower case letters except for the first word and the first word after a colon.) City Where Published, State or Country (only if necessary to iden- tify the city; U.S. Postal Service abbreviations should be used for state iden- tification): Name of Publisher.

The issue number should only be included if the periodical's pages are not numbered consecutively throughout the volume, that is, if each issue begins with page 1. If a periodical article has no author, the name of the periodical should be treated like a corporate author, both in the citation and in the references.

If necessary, such explanations can be presented in one or more appendixes at the end of the article. This material should be presented in as condensed a form as possible; full sentences are not necessary. No tables should be included in the appendixes. A single appendix should be titled APPENDIX in all caps. If more than one appendix is needed, they should be titled and ordered alphabetically: APPENDIX A, APPENDIX B, etc. Biographical Sketches At the time an article is accepted for publication, a brief biographical sketch of 50 or fewer words should be submitted for each author. It should include where highest degree was earned, present position, affiliation, and current research interests. For example: Andrea Barber received her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. She is an associate pro- fessor of management and Director of the Management Improvement Center at Famous University, Oxbridge, Ohio. Her current research interests include dual-career families and sociotechnical systems in organizations.</page><page sequence="7">1993 Volume 18, Number 1 179 Avoidance of Sexist and Other Biased Language Authors must avoid terms or usages that are or may be interpreted as denigrating to ethnic or other groups. Authors should be particularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-established customs (e.g., the use of "men and girls" in the office or "usually if the employee is given an oppor- tunity, he will make the right choice") can imply inferiority where none exists or the acceptance of inequality where none should be tolerated. Using plural pronouns (e.g., changing the "client . .. he" to "clients . .. they") is preferred by Academy publications. If this is not possible, the phrase "he or she" can and should be used. Use of First Person Vigorous, direct, clear, and concise communication should be the ob- jective of all articles in Academy journals. Although third-person style tra- ditionally has been used, authors can use the first person and active voice if they do not dominate the communication or sacrifice the objectivity of the research. Anthropomorphism In the field of management, authors often use phrases like "organiza- tional theory (OT) says," "OT suggests," or "OT proposes." Technically, it is wrong to attribute human functions to nonhuman sources. However, authors accept the fact that OT doesn't literally act, suggest, think, and so forth. The convention is used as a cryptic form for stating conclusions from a body of knowledge. Reference to the authors of this material is implied. Thus, an occasional usage is fine, but if this convention is sloppily or excessively used, AMR will definitely change it.</page><page sequence="8">KING FAHD UNIVERSITY OF PETROLEUM &amp; MINERALS DHAHRAN 31261, SAUDI ARABIA DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT &amp; MARKETING COLLEGE OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT ANNOUNCES FACULTY POSITION OPENINGS SEPTEMBER 1, 1993 FOR THE RANKS OF PROFESSORS, AND ASSOCIATE PROFESSORS IN MANAGEMENT.

There is now a tacit recognition of the fact that: (a) economic actions of business entities have noneconomic consequences (i.e., second order effects) and (b) given their size and economic power, business organizations have an impact on all other institutions of society above and beyond their economic spheres. Therefore, the role that corporations play, and ought to play, has emerged as one of the major issues of our times in all industrialized societies. Furthermore, given the current drive toward privatization and an increasing reli- ance on market mechanisms, the role of large corporations, and especially mul- tinational corporations, has become extremely important in the context of eco- nomic growth in a large number of developing countries. It is also the case, how- ever, that society has an affect on the behavior of corporations. This call for papers recognizes the dynamic and often reciprocal nature of the business/society rela- tionship while stressing such societal influences. AMR plans to publish a special issue that will focus on various theoretical and analytical frameworks that provide insights toward a better understanding of business/society relations, societal expectations of corporate performance, impact of various external sociopolitical forces on corporate behavior, and the internal corporate conditions that mold corporate behavior and management response to these external forces. Manuscripts are invited that address some facet of linkages between societal expectations and corporate behavior. The issues addressed may be macro (i.e., the entire corporate entity) or they may address some micro (inter- nal) aspect of corporate behavior involving a particular level of management, functional aspect, or activity domain. Notwithstanding, the analytical context must be externally oriented, that is, (a) how do various external forces environ- mental conditions influence the framing of corporate issues that have ethical or social responsibility implications, be they employee rights, organizational struc- tures, accountability, internal and external stakeholder rights, whistle blowing, ethical conduct of business, and business-society conflicts under different cultural situations, to name a few or (b) how do organizations effect internal changes and develop external response patterns to react to those policies and practices and environmental conditions. Contributing authors should follow the standard guidelines for AMR papers described in the Notice to Contributors. Cover letters should specify a request to have the paper considered for this specific Theory Development Forum. All sub- mitted papers will be evaluated using the standard AMR review process, with the additional criterion being responsiveness to this announcement. The number of papers published in this Theory Development Forum will be determined by the outcome of these reviews. We envision this Forum to be limited to a section of a single issue. To be considered for this special Forum, papers must be received by April, 1, 1993. Papers should be submitted to the AMR office. Guest editor is S. Prakash Sethi, Department of Management, City University of New York (CUNY), Baruch College, 17 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10010.</page><page sequence="10">THEORY DEVELOPMENT FORUM: CALL FOR PAPERS ON THEORY BUILDING Total Quality: The Customer-Focused Organization in Management Theory The diffusion of total quality (TQ) throughout the world economic community has created a Copernican revolution in management practice. No longer expecting their customers to adjust to them, TQ-focused managers are trying with increased frequency to orient their organizations to their customers. Continuously improving processes to meet customer expectations has become a central practice in many diverse organizations. The academic literature on organizations and management has not kept pace with these developments. Although there are thousands of articles in the business press on quality and customer relationships, there are but a handful in our jour- nals, and very little theory has been accumulated. This disparity is especially glaring insofar as management theory issues (e.g., competitive strategy, leader- ship, cultural change) are at the heart of the quality movement. This special Forum is meant to begin to redress this imbalance and to extend the "boundaryless organizations" theme of the 1993 Academy meeting by moving customers to center stage in management theory. Our aim is to publish papers that make substantial progress in building theory about customer-focused organizations. This could mean developing new theories or extending existing theories to address research questions generated by TQ practices, or it could mean exploring conflicts between existing theory and TQ as it is promoted or practiced. Manufacturing, service, and/or public-sector organi- zations are all viable potential domains for theory development. We welcome contributions from all divisions and interest groups in the Acad- emy. Potential research questions include: What is the role of customer satisfac- tion in conceptualizing organizational effectiveness? How can TQ become a per- manent part of an organization? What is the relationship of TQ to models of strat- egy and technology? How has the idea of customer-focused organizations evolved in management theory? What changes in organization design and human resource theory are implied by TQ practices? What ethical issues are associated with cus- tomer-focused organizations? Does TQ require a new theory of leadership? What changes in research methods are necessary to study organizations from the cus- tomer's standpoint? Contributing authors should follow the standard guidelines for AMR papers described in the Notice to Contributors. Cover letters should specify a request to have the paper considered for this specific Theory Development Forum. All sub- mitted papers will be evaluated using the standard AMR review process with the additional criterion being responsiveness to this announcement.
