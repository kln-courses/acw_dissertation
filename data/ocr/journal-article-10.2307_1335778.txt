<plain_text><page sequence="1">APPLICABILITY OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO PRIVATE OR- GANIZATIONS.- The body of law construing the Fourteenth Amend- ment contains one proposition which has been accepted as axiomatic that the prohibitory 1 clauses apply solely to state action. Several com- paratively recent cases, however, seem to indicate that a private organ- ization may, under some circumstances, be subjected to the same limitations as the states. These cases squarely present two questions: first, whether the Fourteenth Amendment may properly be applied to private organizations; and, second, if so, what circumstances are required to invoke it. A frequently cited definition of the ambit of the Fourteenth Amend- ment is that of Mr. Justice Bradley in the Civil Rights Cases: "It is state action of a particular character that is prohibited. Individual in- vasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the amend- ment." 2 But even before this rule was enunciated, the Supreme Court had recognized that the Amendment encompassed more than statutes and acts of state officials in compliance with statutes. Its prohibitions extend to individuals exercising state powers, whether or not in a man- ner authorized by state law.3 Later cases went further and included within the scope of the Amendment acts of state officials, not merely unauthorized by state law, but actually prohibited by it.4 Such applica- tion of the Fourteenth Amendment to individuals is a departure from its express terms but is justified insofar as necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it was adopted. The procedural remedies available for enforcement of the Amend- ment were similarly broadened. Not only could judicial invalidation of 1 "No State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal pro- tection of the laws." 2 I09 U.

One method of preventing a state from discriminating against Negroes in selecting juries, for example, is to in- validate verdicts of juries so selected.5 Much more effective is to fine or imprison the state officials responsible.6 Judicial Extension of the Scope of the Amendment. -Logically, a corollary of the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to indi- viduals is its application to organizations and corporations. Yet this step has been taken, if at all, only recently. One explanation for this may be that, when the courts have held the act of an individual to fall within the Amendment, they have done so on the theory that the particular act could be subsumed under the heading of state action.7 Where state officials exercise governmental powers to effect a denial of due process or equal protection, it requires no great effort to find state action. In the case of a private organization, however, there is seldom such an obvious connection with the state. Illustrative of the confused results reached by the state action theory is the series of Texas "white primary" decisions. The Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional a statute which prohibited Negro par- ticipation in the Democratic primary.8 The Texas legislature then em- powered the executive committee of every party to prescribe qualifi- cations for membership. This expedient, too, was invalidated.9 The Court pointed out that, in exercising this state-given power, the com- mittee was an agency of the state and subject to the Fourteenth Amend- ment.10 Twenty-two days after the decision was rendered, the state conven- tion of the Texas Democratic party resolved that only whites should be eligible for membership. In Grovey v. Townsend,"1 the Supreme Court held that this resolution was in no way incompatible with the Federal Constitution. The party is a private organization and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments apply solely to state action. The effect of this literal adherence to the state action theory was to enable the state to evade constitutional restrictions by permitting a private organization to assume state functions. A more realistic justification for applying the Fourteenth Amendment would rely less on the anthropomorphic concept of state action and more on the conjunction of the individual act and governmental authority. Nevertheless, even within the framework of the state action theory, the Supreme Court has applied constitutional restrictions to private 'Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587 (I935); Strauder v.

Town- send, is the clearest illustration. The Court did not consider the fact that the Texas Democratic party was a private organization as con- clusive, but characterized the action of the party as state action for two reasons: the comprehensive regulation and supervision of the pri- mary by the state; and the governmental function served by the primary in Texas, where nomination by the Democratic party is equivalent to election.13 Although both of these elements were absent, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals applied the Fourteenth Amendment to a private organization in Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library.14 The defendant was a privately endowed library, governed by a self-perpetuating board of trustees, appointed by the original donor. The city and state con- tributed most of its operating funds. The trustees had barred Negroes from its training school for librarians. The court held that this dis- crimination was state action and violative of the Fourteenth Amend- ment. The contribution of state funds was a factor not present in the "white primary" cases. But the Kerr decision goes beyond Allwright, in that maintaining a school for librarians, unlike conducting an election, is not necessarily a governmental function.15 The cases thus far discussed were purportedly consistent with the state action theory. Marsh v. Alabama 16 seems to have carried the logic of these cases beyond the confines of such a narrow rationale. In that case the Supreme Court reversed a conviction under an Alabama statute which makes it a crime to remain on the premises of another after having been warned not to do so. The defendant, a Jehovah's Witness, distributed religious literature on the streets of Chickasaw, a town wholly owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Company. She refused to leave at the request of company officials and was arrested. The actual effect of the Supreme Court decision is to nullify an action of the state - the conviction under the trespass statute. But, to reach such a result, the 12 32I U. S. 649 (I944). 13 The Court did not base its decision on the Fourteenth Amendment, but on the Fifteenth. Both Amendments, however, involve the identical problem of de- fining "state action." 14 I49 F.2d 2I2 (C. C. A. 4th I945). 15 The result reached in the Kerr case was foreshadowed in Steele v. Louisville &amp; N. R. R., 323 U. S. I92 (I944), a case involving the Fifth Amendment. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers had been certified under the Railway Labor Act as exclusive bargaining agent for the firemen of the defendant railroad. Plain- tiff, a Negro fireman, sued unsuccessfully in the Alabama courts to enjoin perform- ance of a union-negotiated contract which would have excluded Negroes from the craft. The Supreme Court, in reversing the state court, said that if the Railway Labor Act authorized such a contract, serious constitutional questions would arise. But mere lack of authority from the Act would not have been grounds for enjoin- ing performance of the contract. The Court finds implicit in the grant of power to the union the requirement that it exercise it without discrimination. Thus, the case differs from the Kerr and Allwright cases in that the court did not directly apply the constitutional restrictions to the union, but accomplished the same result by inferring a prohibition from the Railway Labor Act. 16 326 U.

REV. 848.</page><page sequence="4">I948] NOTES 347 Court must of necessity have held that the Fourteenth Amendment limits the powers of the private organization which owns the town of Chickasaw.17 The statute was not declared unconstitutional. Similar statutes have been upheld where the trespass has been on the property of a small landowner.18 Since the corporation, however, is performing the functions of a municipality, it may no more impair the rights of freedom of the press and religion than a muncipality regularly organ- ized.19 Only because the corporation has no right to prevent the dis- tribution of literature is the conviction erroneous. The cases discussed seem to establish the principle that the Four- teenth Amendment sets limits to the activities of a private organiza- tion which exercises a governmental function or which has a sufficient nexus with the state. Such doubts as exist stem from two circumstances: (i) the Supreme Court, while implicitly subscribing to this view, has never expressly stated the proposition; (2) much uncertainty exists as to the exact relationship necessary to invoke the Amendment. It is with the second of these that the remainder of this Note will be con- cerned. Analysis of Decisional Developments. -The Fourteenth Amend- ment, read literally, is a limitation solely on the powers of the states. As a first step in defining its applicability to private organizations, it is necessary to re-examine some of the considerations which have ac- tuated the courts to go beyond the bare words of the Amendment. Most compelling of these is the purpose for which the Amendment was adopted. At the very least, it was intended to secure individuals, par- ticularly recently freed Negroes, against the use of governmental au- thority in a manner prejudicial to them.20 It was to effectuate this limitation on the state that the Amendment has been extended to in- dividuals and private organizations. The cases indicate a development in two distinct directions: (i) in- tensively, where direct enforcement against a state was impractical or inadequate; (2) extensively, where a private organization exercised powers equivalent to those of a state. (a) Intensive Aspects. -The intensive aspect first manifested it- self in punishment of individual state officials for participation in a violation of the Amendment.21 Not only is this a more effective way of inducing compliance than direct action against the state, but, in some cases, it is the only method of enforcement. If a state sheriff mur- ders a prisoner in his charge, the violation is beyond nullification by the 17 But cf. Comment, 45 Micn. L. REV- 733, 744 (0947). 18 E.g., State v.

S. 339 (i879).</page><page sequence="5">348 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 6i federal courts.22 An analogous irreversible violation may arise where a state delegates a function or gives aid to a private organization. It would be anomalous if a state, prohibited from exercising its power in a particular manner, could delegate that power to a private organization which could not be restrained. A state, for example, can- not constitutionally exclude Negroes from primaries;23 therefore, a private group cannot exercise state-given powers to effect the same re- sult.24 Otherwise, the effect of the Amendment would be merely to re- quire the states to observe proper formalities in evading it. A second situation calling for intensive application of the Four- teenth Amendment may arise when a state assists a private organization. The Supreme Court has held that it is a denial of equal protection of the laws for a state to provide legal education for white students with- out providing equal facilities for Negroes.25 Suppose the state, instead of maintaining its own school, contributed funds to a privately endowed university, which then adopted a policy of accepting only white students. As in the previous case, white students would be given greater oppor- tunities than Negroes. According to the reasoning of the Kerr case, the university could be required to admit students without regard to color.26 It might be possible to prevent a misuse of benefits received from the state by enjoining further state aid. Such direct pressure might be effective where assistance is in the form of a periodic subsidy or tax exemption. But this is not always the situation. If the assistance is a grant of the power of eminent domain, for example, direct action against the state is a futile gesture, once the recipient has taken title to the land. Unless, in a situation of this kind, action can be taken against the private organization which has received state aid, the con- stitutional prohibitions on the state are unenforceable. (b) Extensive Aspects. -Intensive enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment solves the problem of effectuating prohibitions on the state when direct action against a state is impractical. The extensive aspect of the development of the scope of the Amendement is a solution to a very different problem - the exercise by private organizations of powers similar to those of the state. Marsh v. Alabama is the clearest 22 Cf. Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 9I (I945). 23Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536 (I927). 24 Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73 (I932). 25 Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U. S. 337 (I938). 28 For a state to assist an organization which discriminates is not, however, necessarily a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Tax exemption, for instance, is given to many organizations -churches, denominational schools, sectarian chari- ties - which in their nature must limit their benefits to a restricted group. It may not be a denial of equal protection for 'a state to aid schools maintained by a particular religious group, if the same aid is available on equal terms to schools maintained by any religious group. Cf. Note, 6o HARV. L. REV. 793 (I947). But the situation is different when the assistance is given, not by virtue of a general law, but by special grant. If aid is given only to a limited number of organizations and they discriminate on the basis of race or color, in effect the state itself may be discriminating.</page><page sequence="6">1948] NOTES 349 instance. There was no question of the state's using the Gulf Ship- building Company as an agency to suppress freedom of religion in Chickasaw. It was because the corporation, though purporting merely to exercise its rights as a property owner, was able to act as a munici- pality that the Supreme Court applied constitutional restrictions.27 In some cases it may be difficult to distinguish between arrogation of governmental authority and exercise of personal rights. Grovey v. Townsend upheld a resolution of the Texas Democratic party exclud- ing Negroes on the ground that one of the rights of a private organiza- tion is to choose its members. Smith v. Allwright held the same resolu- tion invalid largely on the ground that, in its primary, the party was conducting a governmental function - election of public officials. The Stuyvesant Case. Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town Corp.28 presents in microcosm many of the problems in the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to private organizations. Stuyvesant Town is a privately owned housing development covering eighteen city blocks in New York City. It is being constructed pursuant to a contract with the city under which the city condemned the land and granted Stuyvesant a twenty- five year partial tax exemption. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin Stuyvesant from refusing to rent to them, or other Negroes, contending that the nature of the undertaking, the privileges conferred on the corporation by the city, and the comprehensive state supervision of the project were such as to bring the corporation within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment. The New York Supreme Court, in denying an injunction, rejected the major premise of the plaintiff's case - that a private corporation may under some circumstances be subject to the Four- teenth Amendment. In the light of the cases which have applied the Amendment to private organizations, the assumption of the New York court seems unwarranted. The result, nevertheless, may be correct, unless the particular facts of the Stuyvesant case call for application of constitutional restrictions. The case has elements which might invoke the Fourteenth Amend- ment both in its extensive and intensive aspects. When Stuyvesant Town excludes Negroes, the effect is the same as if the eighteen blocks were zoned on racial lines. Such zoning would be prohibited if done by a state or one of its subdivisions.29 The New York court saw Stuy- vesant's discrimination merely as the exercise by a landlord of his privilege to rent to whomever he chooses. It may be, however, that if a large enough landowner exercises his private rights, the effect will be so similar to an exercise of governmental authority that the Four- 27 Smith v. Allwright is more equivocal because previously Texas had used the Democratic party as a means of disenfranchising Negroes. But by the time of the A1lwright decision, the efforts of the state had been frustrated. In excluding Negroes from membership (and thus from the primary), the Democratic party acted solely on its own initiative. 28 74 N. Y. S.2d 220 (Sup. Ct. I947). 29 Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60 (i9i7).</page><page sequence="7">350 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 6i teenth Amendment will intervene. Marsh v. Alabama and Smith v. Allwright point in this direction. But those cases define only imper- fectly the scope of the extensive application of the Fourteenth Amend- ment, and the operation of Stuyvesant Town is not such a clear exercise of a governmental function as was presented in the two earlier cases. A sounder basis for applying the Fourteenth Amendment to Stuy- vesant might be as a means of enforcing the limitations on the state - intensive enforcement. Where, as in the Stuyvesant case, a state assists a private corporation through tax exemption or eminent domain, two related but distinct questions may arise. First, is the effect of the assist- ance to deny equal protection to some group? Second, can such a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment be prevented by direct pro- ceedings against the state? (a) Tax Exemption. -If a state should grant direct subsidies to encourage housing for whites and not provide similarly for Negroes, there would be a clear denial of equal protection.30 In economic effect, tax exemptions may be the same as a direct subsidy, but the courts have treated the two differently.31 The Supreme Court has declared that a state is free to select the subjects of taxation and exemption and that neither due process nor equal protection imposes a rigid rule of equality.32 A taxpayer is not denied equal protection because some- one else has received an exemption, provided the basis of differentia- tion is reasonable. But it may be a violation of equal protection in a wholly different sense for the state to subsidize, through tax exemp- tions, an organization which discriminates. If, for example, a state exempts a school from taxation, it is not a denial of equal protection for it to tax a home-owner. But if the school discriminates against Negroes, the effect of the tax-exemption may be to give greater educa- tional opportunities to whites and therefore be, as to Negroes, a denial of equal protection. Even when it is clear that a state has employed tax exemption to effect a discrimination, there are two difficulties in using tax exemption as a basis for invoking the Fourteenth Amendment. The first is pro- cedural. Can a suit be brought to enjoin the state from continuing tax exemption? 33 Can the court compel imposition of a tax? 34 Or does a declaration that an exemption is invalid automatically impose the tax? These difficulties are not insuperable obstacles, but they do indicate that, if tax exemption is used as a means of discrimination, the Four- teenth Amendment may be enforced only intensively -that is, by indirect action against the organization receiving the exemption.

S. i874).</page><page sequence="8">I948] NOTES 35I second difficulty is conceptual. Unlike the procedural difficulty, it is not confined to suits directed against the state. If a state effects a denial of equal protection through failure to tax, how can the inaction of the state be a basis of proceedings against the organization thus exempted? This dilemma is grounded in a failure to recognize that tax exemption is a favor given by the state. It differs from the freedom from taxation enjoyed by those outside a class taxed. If a tax is levied on realty, the owners of personalty do not escape by virtue of special privilege. But the situation is different where a particular organization is exempted from the real property tax. In the latter case there is a basis for imposing the tax, but through special dispensation of the state the particular organization is excused. This is clearly the situation in the Stuyvesant case where the exemption was given to the corporation by a contract with the City of New York. (b) Eminent Domain. - Is it a violation of the Fourteenth Amend- ment for a state to give the benefit of eminent domain to a private organization which discriminates on grounds of race or color? The Federal Constitution contains no express limitation on the state's power of eminent domain. The courts, nevertheless, have read into the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment restrictions similar to those on the Federal Government, which is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment from taking private property for public use without just compensation. There are two theories as to what constitutes such a public use as will justify conferring the benefit of eminent domain on a private organization.35 The first gives the words "public use" their literal connotation - the general public must have the right to use the facilities or service for which the land is taken.36 This narrow view excluded such purposes as low-cost housing projects, since their facili- ties are open only to a limited number of persons. In upholding low- cost housing laws, the courts necessarily abandoned the older view in favor of the second theory that, if there is a sufficiently broad public benefit, there is a public use.37 But the two theories are not mutually exclusive. A housing program may be permitted to benefit a limited class of citizens, but it might be required that this limited class be selected from the general public without regard to race or color.38 (c) State Regulation. - A third basis relied on by the plaintiffs in the Stuyvesant case was the close supervision of the project by the state. 35 See Nichols, The Meaning of Public Use in the Law of Eminent Domain, 20 B. U. L. REV. 615 (1940). 36E.g., United States v. Certain Lands in Louisville, 9 F. Supp. I37 (W. D. Ky. 1935), aff'd on other grounds, 78 F.2d 684 (C. C. A. 6th I935); see i LEWIS, EM- INENT DOMAIN 505-12 (3d ed. i909). 37 Murray v. LaGuardia, 29i N. Y. 320, 52 N. E.2d 884 (I943); N. Y. City Housing Authority v. Miller, 270 N. Y. 333, I N. E.2d 153 (1936). 38In Connecticut College v. Calvert, 87 Conn. 42i, 88 Atl. 633 (1913), grant of eminent domain power to a college was denied, because its charter contained no express provision against discrimination. Cf. University of Southern California v. Robbins, I Cal. App.2d 523, 37 P.2d i63 (1934) (grant of power upheld where such provision included).</page><page sequence="9">352 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 6i It was suggested that one of the bases of Smith v. Allwright is the com- prehensive regulation of primaries by Texas. In the absence of other evidence linking an organization to the state, however, it is difficult to trace any connection between regulation by the state and the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to the organization. A landlord may be subject to extensive control by zoning laws, building requirements, sanitary provisions, safety regula- tions, and rent ceilings. But that does not make discrimination by him such an abuse of state power as falls within the purview of the Amendment. The fact that an individual is subject to some restric- tions should not be a ground for imposing others. Conclusion. -As long as the Fourteenth Amendment is applied to private organizations as a means of carrying out the purposes of the Amendment, the departure from the literal wording is more apparent than real. Nevertheless, it is not accurate to say that the prohibitory clauses are applicable solely in direct suits against the state. The courts have found it necessary to apply the Amendment to private organiza- tions in two situations: (i) where a state has violated the Amendment, but direct enforcement against the state is not feasible; (2) where a private organization has exercised powers similar to those of a state. Whether or not it ever was the law, it is not true today that "Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the Amend- ment."</page></plain_text>
