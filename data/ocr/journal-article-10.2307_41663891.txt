THE X ON THE RÍO URURl' MARKS THE APPROXIMATE AREA IN WHICH THE COLLECTION OF GOLD OBJECTSJ»RESENTED HERE WAS DISCOVERED. By Russell H. Mitchell Recent Discoveries in 198</page><page sequence="2">Northern Panama As one studies the map of lower Central America, one sees that a spur extends from the higher mountains which form the backbone of the narrow Isthmian area. This spur, known as the Talamancan Mountains, angles upward toward the north in the region of the boundary between Panama and Costa Rica. As the main ridge of mountains continues down to the southwest, one en- counters the highest peak in Panama, El Volcán de Barú. The triangular area between these two mountain ridges and the sea contains the headwaters of several rather large rivers. The one with which we are concerned is the Rio Changuinola, which originates immediately north of El Baru. This river drains into the Caribbean Sea a short distance north of the Bahía del Almirante, named after Christopher Columbus. This area, the north- ernmost province of the Republic of Panama, is named Bocas del Toro. The rainfall in this province is legend- ary; it is claimed that there is no dry season here, only a wet season. However, there is often a short dry period about October, but when and if this will occur is not always certain. Because of the heavy rainfall there is much cultivated land along the coast and the lower ele- vations. The United Fruit Company has its banana plan- tations up and down the coast and along the river val- leys. Farther up these rivers and streams are located the "fincas," the ranches and farms of the small landholders. Behind these pioneers are the "tame" Indians, direct de- scendants of the former fierce, head-taking Indians who lived in this area before the time of Columbus. Beyond the Indian habitations the topography be- comes increasingly rugged. The rivers dash through deep canyons from whose edges the land rises abruptly to steep and narrow ridges. These, in turn, continue to rise until the hills become mountains. Covering this in- hospitable highland territory is virgin jungle in which today, in spite of the great quantity of game in the forests and fish in the streams, there are no inhabitants. That at one time people lived in this area is suggested by tales of hunters, who have encountered mounds pro- tected by gigantic and ferocious-appearing statues, of stone. There are also indications that cultivation was carried on here, for stands of sisal (used for fiber) and clusters of pejibaye palms (used for food) have been found. Although there are no trails nor any traces of the homes of the former inhabitants, some of their burials have been discovered. Just who these people were is conjectural. The Bribri, who live at the head- waters of the Sixaola River, may have extended to this region as well. It is more probable, though, that mem- bers of the Talamancan branch of the Guaymi Indians lived here, and that the Changuenas and Dorasques oc- cupied the area from time to time. The home of the Dorasques was Chiriqui, so it may well have been they who introduced the elements of the Classic Chiriqui culture which are found here. These groups warred with each other for the usual purposes: obtaining trophy heads and victims for sacrifice, and winning prestige. It is known that even in late historical times the chiefs and major warriors of the Bribri wore golden pendants. As similar tomb and cist burials, together with similar artifacts, exist in other Guaymi areas, it must be presumed that the Guaymi of this area had a similar material culture and mythology. It is most likely that the basic tradition represented by all of these peoples is Chibchan, that is, they were part of an early return migration from South America, particularly from the central Colombian highlands surrounding Bogotá. At the present time information regarding the arti- facts retrieved from burials in this area is limited. In fact, the province of Bocas del Toro is virtually unknown from an archaeological viewpoint. While Columbus men- tioned " espejos de oro " from the north coast of Vera- guas (which at that time included Bocas del Toro) dur- ing his fourth voyage in 1502, there has been only an occasional mention of Bocas in archaeological literature. For over one hundred years the world has been hear- ing of the tremendous gold finds in the huacales , or graveyards, of Bugaba and Bugavita in the province of 199</page><page sequence="3">1. Left: Gold eagle from Bocas del Toro. Note the collar and the small feet projecting forward. Height 6.5 cm., weight 30 grams. Right: Tumbaga eagle with bells as eyes. The design along the lower edges of the wings probably represents the primary wing feathers. Height 8 cm., weight 57.5 grams. Panama continued Chiriqui. Countless other rich sites have been plundered throughout other parts of Chiriqui. However, no one appeared to find much material across the cordillera, in the province of Bocas del Toro. Recently I had the opportunity to view a collection of gold artifacts and a few associated objects which came from the central highlands of Bocas del Toro, on the Rio Changuinola and above its tributary, the Río Ururi (three to four thousand feet above sea-level). None of the available charts is sufficiently accurate to place the site with cer- tainty. The majority of the associated artifacts were left behind, as they were too bulky to carry and in most cases had been "killed" (i.e. broken, so that the spirit of the object might accompany the spirit of the de- ceased on his journey into the unknown), making it impractical to carry them out on the huaquero's back for the four or five-day return journey to civilization. Some of the artifacts which were brought out tend to indicate a blend of highland Costa Rica and Classic Chiriqui cultures. They also contain a few elements formerly known only from the valley of the Rio Grande de Térraba. Some of the pottery which accompanied the jewelry has well executed painted and modeled motifs reminiscent of the Classic Chiriqui. Some of the gold is also similar to the gold relics found in Chiriqui, as well as those from southern Veraguas. There is also stone sculpture similar to that shown in the material from the Mercedes site, in Costa Rica. That the gold artifacts of this region were carried by trade to distant areas is proved by the discovery of many such items in the cenote of sacrifice at Chichen Itza in Yucatan. The Mexican tribes had contact with this area before the Conquest, as is indicated by the known fact that tribute- seeking groups of warrior-merchants were in the area around the present Costa Rican-Panamanian border at the time of the fall of Moctezuma. The gold-working techniques are the same as those seen so commonly in the provinces of Chiriqui and Veraguas and the Isthmian area in general, and are well described elsewhere. Some of the gold is of very good grade; other articles contain a considerable amount of copper. Tumbaga , or carbon gold, is also present All the artifacts are hollow cast, that is, the backs are open. To date, no copper artifacts have been found, although they are known to occur in Chiriqui. The custom of " 'killing* the object buried with the dead is evident and has been carried out thoroughly in some cases. This applies to the pottery and stone as well as to the gold. The majority of the suspension rings do not show wear, indicating the probability that these rich artifacts were manufactured as burial offerings only. A large number of the golden offerings are bells, containing pellets in a hollow created in the eyes or body cavity. The first two gold objects we show (Figure 1) represent a bird, whether eagle or parrot or some other 200</page><page sequence="4">2. Gold effigy of a tigre. Length 3.5 cm., weight 17.5 grams. 3. Paired gold conejos, with suspension rings in the front paws of each animal. Length 3.7 cm., weight 22.5 grams. 4. Front and back views of a tubular gold ornament with three heads surmounted by three birds. The back view shows the hollows in the heads and the large suspension ring. Length 6.2 cm., weight 63.5 grams. 5. Unusual frog effigy of fine gold from Bocas del Toro. Weight 30 grams. 201</page><page sequence="5">6. Gold frog similar to those found in Chiriqui and Vera- guas. Length 3.6 cm., weight 15.5 grams. 7. Double effigy of a mythological creature. This is the largest and heaviest piece in the collection. Width 8.3 cm., weight 93 grams. Panama continued mythological creature is unknown. The figure at the left is of bright yellow gold, while that at the right has a higher copper content, giving it a reddish color. It has a carbon core and is therefore known as tumbaga. This subject is the most common one known from the Isth- mian area. It may represent the Huacamaya, or sacred bird, which was sacrificed to appease the deities. Accord- ing to Chibchan tradition, if a parrot or parakeet were taught to speak a few words, then it could become as satisfying a sacrifice to the gods as would a human sacrifice, thus sparing a human life. The object in Figure 2 is a naturalistic effigy of a jaguar, or tigre , as it is called locally. It is yellow in color, which shows that it is made of a very good grade of gold. Figure 3 most likely represents two animals known locally as conejos. It is of good quality gold, a fine yellow in color. At one time there may have been a structural element between the animals' mouths. One of the most interesting items in the group is shown in Figure 4. Three birds are sitting on a tube from which hang three heads. The heads, which are hollow and contain pellets so that they ring like bells, probably represent trophies, for the tribes of the region customarily took the heads of their enemies. This piece is of very fine gold and is very well executed. It resem- bles some of the long tubular beads found in the Codé and Veraguas provinces of Panama, but obviously the tube was not meant to be used as such because there is a suspension ring on it. Figure 5 shows an unusual frog effigy of a very fine yellow gold. Whereas frogs are rather common among the pre-Columbian artifacts of the Isthmian area, this one has an unusual crouching position. Its eyes are bells. The face is vertical and the mouth is outlined by a braided band. Two parallel bands run along the back. Their leaf -like design is probably meant to indicate the natural pattern of the skin. Figure 6 shows a type of frog effigy more common in the Isthmian area. This is also of a yellow color, indicating the use of relatively pure gold. What animal is represented in Figure 7 cannot be determined, but each head is surmounted by a sort of crest, creating an appearance not unlike that of the large lizard called iguana, a well known epicurean delight on the Isthmus. The double-headed snake motif appears in the tails of these monsters. Each body cavity is a separate bell. Figure 8 shows the most magnificent item in the col- lection. It seems to represent a two-headed, two-tailed turtle. The body is a single bell. The gold is exceedingly fine and the workmanship is exquisite. There are suspen- sion rings at the ends of the front legs. A twisted bar runs from each side of each head to the front paws, serving to strengthen the object. The snake element appears again in the double tail. Anthropomorphic effigies are shown in Figure 9. The one on the left, the simplest, is of high-grade gold and shows several interesting features. A headdress is ac- companied by whorls which possibly represent large ear spools. There are no other indications of dress. The male genitals are realistically portrayed. The limbs are greatly out of proportion to the body; the arms are very small, whereas the legs and feet are exaggerated. 202</page><page sequence="6">8. Double-headed turtle effigy, with snake tails. This is the finest object in the collection. Length 6.2 cm., weight 87.5 grams. 9. Left: Gold anthropomorphic figure. Height 4.3 cm., weight 19.5 grams. Center: Tumbaga figurine with two figures on its shoulders. The figure has been broken. Height 11.2 cm. Right: Gold figurine in the form of a deity holding a double-headed snake. Note the elaborate headdress. Height 4.6 cm., weight 30 grams. 10. Naturalistic clay effigy of an armadillo in the Classic Chiriqui Alligator Ware. The colors are red, cream and black. 203</page><page sequence="7">11. Clay stool with four nude figures holding up the edge. The surface has an orange-red slip. 12. Stone object consisting of a container supported by two feline figures. Its exact use is unknown. Panama continued The feet have been drawn out by hammering, a process commonly used by Isthmian pre-Columbian metal work- ers. The figure in the center is a monstrosity which ap- pears rather frequently among the tumbaga pieces from Chiriqui. The object, reddish-yellow in color, illustrates the use of the process (mise en couleur) of purifying the surface gold by dissolving out the impurities (mainly copper) with acids. This two-headed anthropomorphic creature has its genitals represented by a frog, probably a fertility symbol. A tail encircled the body, much like that shown in the two smaller figures perched on the shoulders of the larger one. There is a large suspension ring in back. The object on the right in Figure 9 is a zoomorphic or anthropomorphic deity in which the dou- ble-headed snake motif is again seen. The headdress is elaborate and has ear whorls. This image has a bell in its body cavity. It had been "killed": when found, the head and feet were jammed into the body cavity, while the upper limbs and the snakes were bent forward across the front. The fact that it could be restored so well, without soldering or other artificial means, speaks for the purity of the gold. Gold pectoral disks were also found, three thus far with the material from this area. They are very heavy, often weighing more than a figurine of equal size. As mentioned before, other artifacts are limited in number. A tripod with zoomorphic effigies has been found, similar to others seen from Veraguas to the Línea Vieja region of Costa Rica. Another type, an open polychrome tripod bowl, with legs in the shape of "fish otter" heads, is seen frequently in the valley of the Rio Grande de Térraba but has not been previously encountered north of the cordillera. Figure 10 shows a well executed effigy of an arma- dillo, of the Alligator Ware of the Classic Chiriqui cul- ture. A clay stool, a type not unusual in Chiriqui, is shown in Figure 11. Four monsters are represented holding up a flat, circular platform. At each point on the circumference where the hands touch, a face is de- picted. These may be animal or human, or may represent trophy heads. The stone object in Figure 12 would be much more common over the Talamancan Mountains in the Mercedes area of the Línea Vieja region. Two feline figures, facing in opposite directions, support a shallow receptacle, either a stool or a container. There is a well carved guilloche pattern along the rim. As one can see from the breaks, this piece was "killed." This collection has been presented in an effort to aid in filling some of the gaps which still exist in our knowl- edge of the pre-Columbian peoples of the Isthmian area. More detailed information regarding type of burials, associated artifacts and other pertinent material will be forthcoming in the future.

He studied at St. Am- brose College, Davenport, Iowa (A.B. 1947), University of Notre Dame (B.S. 1948) and the University of Minnesota (M.D. 1951). He also holds the title of Lieutenant Commander, Medical Corps, U.S. Naval Reserve. In addition to Dr. Mitch- ell's medical duties on the staff of Gorgas Hospital, Panama Canal Zone (where he has been since 1950), he is President of the Archaeological Society of Panama. His interest is in relating the archaeology of the Isthmian area to the anthropology of the Americas. Dr. Mitchell informs us that a sad note is to be added to his account of this interesting collection of artifacts: the man who brought them out from this wild and unknown area of Panama subsequently returned there with a companion, and neither has been heard of since. Four or five search parties have failed to find any trace of the two men. 204</page></plain_text>
