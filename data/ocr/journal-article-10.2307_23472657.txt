<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ma'ale Eilat, 'En Netafim Assaf Holzer and UziAvner (Hebrew section: p. 130) In September 1998 an excavation was conducted above 'En Netafim in the Mountains of Eilat (map ref. 1378/8895), after M. Shemtov had observed ceramic objects of a cultic character from the Chalcolithic period or the Early Bronze Age. The excavation, undertaken jointly by the Antiquities Authority and the Society for the Protection of Nature in the framework of the annual enterprise in memory of Benny Meseiner, was directed by A. Holzer and U. Avner, with the participation of family members, friends, and personnel from the Eilat Field School. The ceramic objects (Fig. 198) were found south of the Muslim pilgrims' encampment from the Mam luk and Ottoman periods adjoining Dharb el-Haj. These comprise a figurine of a woman (height 16.4 cm; a goddess?) raising her arms; eighteen fragments of similar anthropomorphic figurines; a fragment of an ostrich(?) figurine; two square ceramic objects (3-5 x 5.0 x 5.5 cm) shaped like altars or pedestals; five fragments of similar objects; three miniature bowls (diam. 3-5 cm); and forty two fragments of similar bowls. Prior to the excava tion, animal bones were found on the surface; these included small cattle, rabbits and a camelâ€” apparently belonging to the Muslim site. The exca vation was undertaken in the tract where the ceramic objects were observed, and in three tent bases belonging to the encampment. It emerged that the cultic objects were discarded by the Mus lim pilgrims who erected the camp; the cultic installation to which these objects originally be longed has not survived. First, the stones scattered about the surface (8 x 18 m) were removed. Next, two areas (2 x 5, 3x5 m), divided into small squares (lxl m), were dug. In both, virgin soil, mixed with stones was reached at a depth of 0.1 m. There were also animal teeth and bones, charcoal, several shells and a number of ceramic objects of cultic character, similar to those found on the surface. The excavation of the tent bases showed that one of them was built from standing slabs of sandstone (inner diam. 3-9 m, height 0.4 m); its opening faced southeast. Their beaten earth floor (0.3-0-5 m) was excavated to virgin soil, without producing finds. The second tent base was built from three courses of limestone blocks (inner diam. 3-8 m, height 0.4 m). In the northwestern side were two stone ledges parallel to each other; one was slightly lower than the other. In the southeastern side was a low partition wall of fieldstones. The finds included small strips of cloth, bone splinters, a shell and charcoal, as well as bits of paper left by Egyptian soldiers, dating to the period prior to Israel's statehood. The third tent base was also constmcted from three courses of limestone blocks (inner diam. 4 m, max. height 0.5 m); its opening faced southwest. Inside the tent, by its opening, was a pavement (0.6 x 1.5 m) bordered by small upright slabs of stone. In the east, adjoining the wall, was a small stone-paved installation. On the basis of the pottery from the encampment's vicinity, the tent bases were dated to the Mamluk and Ottoman periods. The tradition of building circular tents in the southern Negev and the Sinai dates from the 5th millennium BCE to the Ottoman period. Square tents are almost entirely absent. Figure caption: 198.
