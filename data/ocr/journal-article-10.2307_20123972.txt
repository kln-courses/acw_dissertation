<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION * JULIAN HARTT I JL HE SUBTITLE OF HaRTSHORNe's MOST REGENT BOOK Suggests strongly enough that he sees his system of metaphysics as making more than a merely dialectical contact with classical traditions ; and very early, traditional theism is recognized as a position Avhose conceptualization of religious experience (or perhaps one ought simply to say "religion") leaves a great deal to be desired. Tra ditional theism was on the trail of perfection, rightly inspired by the religious quest for the same; but the classical tradition made the wrong categoreal choices, e.g., Being rather than Becoming. Traditional theism is therefore inadequate as an interpretation of religion, as well as being dialectically weak at the key points, if not simply refuted. Since theism is the tradition most clearly and considerably involved in Hartshorne's program it may be useful at the outset to sketch that view: (I) God is a being whose perfection is the explanation of all existence and all possibility. (II) God is a being who acts from intention and this inten tion is the realization of the Good for all that exists. (III) Because of a perfection of power (as well as of know ledge and motive) evil is in no sense a "problem" for God. He either has or will overcome evil altogether. In any case "evil" is not a name for any being whose intention (conscious or unconscious) is destruction of Good. (IV) Both as a necessity of His own being and as an adequate explanation of the world, God cannot be in Time and Space. * Charles Hartshorne, The Logic of Perfection (LaSalle, 111.: The Open Court Publishing House, 1962).</page><page sequence="2">750 JULIAN HARTT (V) Man is immortal in respect to some power or constituent of his being. Therefore his final destiny is a timeless (or, at least, everlasting) and indestructible enjoyment of the Good in communion with God. (VI) Relative to all other beings in time and space, and to all finite orders of being, man is a free agent, i.e., is able to deter mine his own action relative to the Good. A considerable choir of metaphysical notables can be identified as friendly to the metaphysics I have just schematized: Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Scotus, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Berkeley, Royce; and perhaps Plato and Whitehead. What we must seek to determine is Hartshorne's relation to this view. In Beyond Humanism, Man's Vision of God, The Divine Rela tivity?to mention only his books?Hartshorne has developed his own theistic account of God and the world. The Logic of Perfec tion restates this position. It also adds logical refinement to the Ontological Argument (he has long been sympathetic to it), and some detailed attention to the Self, its freedom and its immortality. His version of theism can therefore be sketched in relation to the propositions I have stated above, as follows: (I) God is not a causal explanation of the world, if by "causal" one means the Aristotelian efficient cause. God is not the "creator" of everything else that exists, if one means by creator what Aquinas meant by it. On the other hand, God is a partic ipant in the being of everything that exists; and this participation is creative, that is, it is on the side of novel realization of the Good. (The power of being enjoyed by any existent qua existent, cannot be traced causally to any being, no matter how perfect.) (II) Hartshorne's revisionist proposals do not modify this proposition materially. On the side of absoluteness it is difficult to conceive of God as "personal," since there He is abstract. Indeed, as I shall contend below, here "God" would seem properly to denote Ideality as such. On the other hand God as concrete is wholly and purely intentional: He has perfect knowledge of the Good and unqualifiedly good motivation in seeking it for all that exists. God is therefore pure love.</page><page sequence="3">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 751 (III) Here the opposition to the tradition is clearly marked. Hartshorne does not go so far as Brightman in viewing evil as a problem for God Himself. To the contrary, God is inexhaustibly resourceful and infinitely wise in relating Himself to the dis harmony of the world and the frustration of the finite existent. Therefore the world becomes richer, without end. This does not mean that the world, or any other existent, is the product of divine power. (IV) The perfection of God is a necessary reason for saying that He is in time, that is, so far as He is concrete. Therefore God is also subject to change. Moreover, He is affected by events both in the sense of being modified by them and of having feelings by which He is directly related to finite subjects. Here we are led back to (I) : God participates in finite subjects (entities) by feeling their feelings and thus by being concerned for their well-being. At this point the tension with traditional theism is very severe. It is not diminished by Hartshorne's reiteration of his conviction that his view is much more sympathetic with religion. (V) For man to be immortal is for him to be remembered and cherished in God's everlasting memory. There is no human power or constituent of his actual existence which survives death in any other sense. This of course is more than a revision of tra ditional theism. It breaks as decisively with orthodox Christianity, by which term I mean simply to call attention to the fact that many Christians accept immortality in the sense suggested in V, but do not do so on metaphysical grounds primarily. Hartshorne's negative position follows from a view of the self which cannot accommodate immortality in any stronger sense, whatever the demands of religious belief. (VI) Hartshorne makes freedom a feature of every concrete entity, no matter how minute and ephemeral. Freedom is not essentially or peculiarly anthropological in value. I doubt that Hartshorne could make Freedom a concept uniquely pertinent to the human condition. The Existentialists seem to have no clear and steady passage open from the human condition to the cosmos. It appears that Hartshorne has the reverse problem, so far as he understands Freedom to mean the essential spontaneity of activity</page><page sequence="4">752 JULIAN HARTT possessed by every concrete entity. Taking this line he sees no irresolvable tension between Cause and Freedom: spontaneity is generalized and Cause is loosened from its moorings in Necessity. In sum, then, Hartshorne eliminates one constituent of theism (V) traditionally understood, personal immortality, so that God remains as the sole being endowed with everlastingness. The propositions concerning God's perfection are revised (I, III, IV) in order to make divine perfection genuinely responsive to the freedom and aim of everything else that exists. Accordingly, the nub of the matter is Perfection. It now behooves us to see whether Hartshorne's logical refinements of the Ontological Argument redeem this instrument of traditional theism (though it was used also by Spinoza and Hegel) from its refutations. Then we shall want to assay Hartshorne's arguments against the traditional account of God's relation to the world. Finally we shall ask whether neoclassical metaphysics is more responsive to the sound instincts of religion than the classical version of theism. These are of course but so many devices for stating and supporting a dis agreement with Hartshorne: revisions of theism are called for, but not along Hartshorne's lines. II The refinement in the formulation of the Ontological Argu ment is imported from modal logic; and it is designed to show that it is possible to think necessity as a property of existence, or, more properly, of an existent, rather than of propositions alone; so that to say "X necessarily exists" is not to scramble existential and characterizing judgments. Thus "modality" does have to do with a form of logical judgment; but it also makes ontological claims. A necessary proposition is analytically true (Hartshorne says) ; but the "necessary existence" of a perfect being says some thing about actuality rather than validity. Anselm, of course, had already seen this but perhaps not clearly enough, since he seeks to show in Chapter II of Proslogion that God has existence in the mode of necessity, after having argued in Chapter I that the prop osition "God exists" is necessarily true. But Anselm, Hartshorne believes, was working with defective notions of Perfection, and as</page><page sequence="5">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 753 a result was unable to make a proper logical move from necessity in the first mode to necessity in the second. Hartshorne contends that the way to do this is to conceive God as absolutely perfect in certain respects and as relatively perfect in others. As abstract God is timelessly perfect essence, pure ideality. The proposition asserting the existence of such a being cannot be said to contradict any proposition concerning the existence of any other being; so that the existence of such a being is entirely compatible with all other existences; and it cannot be said that the existence of any other being makes the existence of God inconceivable. But this of course does not make the proposition asserting the existence of God a necessary truth. The line Hartshorne takes here relates him, as he acknowledges, to old and new discussions of the Argument. He says: The points of agreement among Findlay, Malcolm, Hartshorne, Anselm, and Descartes are these: for an individual to exist contingently is a defect, hence either "perfect individual" exists non-contingently, or it fails to exist; but since where contingent existence is impossible, failure to exist cannot be contingent failure, either perfection exists necessarily or its nonexistence is necessary ("perfect individual" is impossible). Findlay then argues on logical grounds against necessary existence and infers impossibility; Malcolm argues against impos sibility and infers necessary existence. I take both positions, the one with regard to the classical and the other with regard to the neo classical concepts of perfection and its manner of existing. My con tention is further that the classical view not only makes trouble in connection with the ontological argument, but has many other disad vantages, philosophical and religious. It is one of our legacies from Greece (not from Palestine), and like most such legacies, as it stands it is inadequate to our intellectual and spiritual requirements, (p. 26) The classical conception of perception is a victim of dialectical refutation because it is a conception of a being entirely devoid of potentiality and is therefore incapable of real relationship to any contingent being. Such a being could exist in one mode only, "abstraction"; and could not, therefore, be presupposed by any thing which exists in fact; and it cannot, therefore, be a real necessity for thought. Anselm was right, Hartshorne says, on two cardinal points: (a) divine perfection is on an altogether different footing from anything else whatever; (b) the proposition that such a being necessarily exists is necessarily true. Anselm failed to see that this</page><page sequence="6">754 JULIAN HARTT proposition (b) is analytically true only. The Argument therefore eannot be about any question or matter of fact: it is about the modality of the proposition asserting the existence of God under stood as an absolutely perfect being. Anselm must also be corrected on the first point (a) : God is absolutely perfect only in respect to His "abstract essence." Only by so expressing God's absolute perfection is it possible (logically) to show how (b) is necessarily true; which is to say that on his Absolute or abstract side God rules out nothing positive whatever; the proposition that God (perfection) exists is compatible with any assertion of fact. No state of affairs can be shown to be in compatible with the existence of God. It must be left to other theistic arguments to show that any state of affairs presupposes the existence of such a being. The divine perfection, Hartshorne argues, combines absolute actuality and absolute potentiality. God is coextensive "with all actuality . . . and with all possibility" (p. 65). This is what Hartshorne means when he defines perfection as "modal coin cidence" (p. 38, cf. also p. 77). But we must not forget that "God as necessary is not God in His concrete actuality" (p. 100). So the Ontological Argument deals only with the formally perfect, indeed, with the formality of perfection itself. It is therefore all one to say, divine perfection exists, and to say, God exists, (p. 67) This is the conclusion of an argument showing that God, in his absoluteness, is, rather than has, perfection. I should take this to mean: Perfection ( = God) is a mode of being purely conceivable in itself; and this mode might be called "Ideality" with equal appropriateness. If this substitute identification is reasonably correct we ask whether any proof for the "reality" of this mode is required, since we should no longer be arguing about a being but, rather, about reality itself. Hartshorne seems to me very nearly to agree to this (see pp. 100-101). However, he wants also to unite Ideality and Actuality in one unique being called God. I do not believe he has shown how the ontological argument even hints at such a realization.</page><page sequence="7">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 755 Thus one is left wondering whether the distinction between the Absolute and the relative, the necessary and the contingent (in God) avails to lift the Ontological Argument from any one of its philosophic graves. This miracle may come to pass if a good reason could be found for saying that a modal logic offers a clear clue to the modes of being itself. Here we recall Hartshorne's dialectical move against Findlay: if the proposition asserting the necessary non-existence of divine perfection is true, its truth can not rest upon anything but purely analytical considerations; for otherwise we would have to say that that proposition may be true, i.e., is contingently true; but no consideration of matters of fact can determine whether or not the proposition is true. Therefore the decision must be analytic. The decision can go against the Ontological Argument only if the proposition "God necessarily exists" can be shown to be a self-contradiction. To put the con tention a bit differently: the proposition "God necessarily exists" is either necessarily true or empirically false. But since "God" does not rule out any empirical entity, it cannot be the case that "God necessarily exists" is empirically falsifiable; so it is necessarily true. (This is not to say that the existence of anything implies the existence of God; the necessity of a perfect being in the mode of causality is different from the mode of analytic necessity). But this does not seem to be the good reason for saying that modal logic yields instruction in the modes of being. Is it suffi cient for this purpose to say that a necessarily true proposition is true, when the proposition involved is really a judgment about existence even if it is not about any actually existing thing ? Admittedly if a proposition is true (whether necessarily or not) it is true about something, unless to say it is true is really a way of calling attention to the kind of proposition it is. But in the latter case how shall we expect to learn anything about existence (to say nothing of existent things) from clear knowledge about the various kinds of propositions? Propositions have their own "being," whether they are necessary or contingent notwithstanding; but this is not the being of actual entities. Now "God" is the name of an actual entity, or so religious people commonly suppose. What then can be learned about His being, as an actual entity, from even the most meticulously correct description of the propositional</page><page sequence="8">756 JULIAN HARTT status of, "divine perfection exists"? How is it possible to track God from the propositional mode to the existential mode? The religious life ought to have some clues unless one has already decided that Religion, being all passion, aspiration and hope, requires to be guided into the port of Truth by philosophical helmsmen, who, apparently, need only their native wit to make out the sense in any thing the religious man reports. I think that at this point we ought to see whether Hartshorne's distinction between God as abstract and God as concrete has any further help for us. Let us assume that as abstract God is pure ideality. So far (as we have already seen) "God" is a name for this mode of being; and so far there is no good reason for saying this mode "exists" rather than "is what it is." For example, why should we say that moral principles "exist" rather than that they "are valid"? One might want to say: "The Universe is on the side of Justice" ; but not mean: "there is a divine being whose business it is to enforce justice in the Universe." One might, rather, mean only this: "wherever rational beings exist they must acknowledge the claims of justice." But one might also mean: "by nature man seeks Justice. " So even if the universal and unconditioned validity of "Justice" is asserted, nothing is so far implied concerning any existent being; that is, anything which enables one to ascertain whether or not any particular being exists. "Justice" does not make anything to exist, that is, does not entail an existential judgment. If the same is to be said about any other moral principle, what is left in the notion of the absolute abstract divine essence? A possibility comes to mind: power (or powers), "potentiality" con verted to "potency," such as "love." I suppose the distinction be tween a property and a power is, roughly, this: Power is that which acts. Property inheres in the subject or the object of action. Thus "love" is not only a disposition to act in a certain way, it is the action; and the "disposition" is simply the (pre sumptively) internal initiating phase or moment of the action. Applied to God the perfection of love might be supposed to be His efficacy in realizing the good, and not merely His un impeachable motive in acting. The "motive," as I understand</page><page sequence="9">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 757 Hartshorne, is the abstract aspect: God is favorably disposed towards any and all possibilities. But Ideality has no "disposi tions," tendencies, etc. It is timelessly self-identical. So far as God has motives He has already become Concrete, He exists. He lives. Here His perfection must be something neither contained in, nor even hinted in the logical modality of necessity. His "mate rial" rather than His formal features are called for. Some aspect of the religious life, or of experience otherwise, must supply this. But will this decisive supplemental evidence also indicate how Abstract and Concrete are a unity, as God, in some sense beyond saying that Reality includes both? I do not find a satisfactory answer to this question in Hartshorne's refinements of the Onto logical Argument. What further he proposes on the matter we can consider as pertinent to the second major topic, God's being in relation to the world. Ill Hartshorne contends that the Ontological Argument recovers validity when God is conceived as containing possibilities unrealized at any given moment. In order to be perfect actually as well as abstractly God must change; He must be in process because other wise He would be merely ideal. As a concretely real agent God cannot make things to happen all by Himself; He cannot and would not compel individuals to do one thing rather than another (cf. p. 57). Surely this cannot mean that God is constituted by His powers of sympathetic response to everything that happens in the world? His response is antecedently conditioned by His own purposes. In respect to His purposes God does not change. His "principles" are from everlasting to everlasting?they are timeless, really?His policies "change" as the world changes. As Hartshorne sees it, the world changes because it is every where alive, and Life itself is process, not substance. Life pro duces structure but it also undoes what it has produced. What does God do in this changing world? What does He do about it? Does He have any power sui generis and His own by which to guide Life to a perfection appropriate to it? Or do Life and Freedom carry Him, as they carry everything else, towards maximal realization of possibilities ?</page><page sequence="10">758 JULIAN HARTT Hartshorne believes that the movement towards maximal realization is God's project and in some ways is God's own life. Does he mean therefore that God endows all things with a nisus towards perfection, thus giving things their soul, so to speak? Hartshorne does not hesitate to use some of the language of creatorship in relation to God (see p. 137). If we take this kind of language at its full face-value God is not only the capital case of agency, He is a very special case of agency relative to all other agents. The speciality is at least twofold: (A) God has immediate access to the totality of the past; but not because He is abstractly perfect; His abstract absoluteness cannot be "memory." (B) Every other agent changes because Change is the law of life. God changes in order to be adequate to every state of the world and to every agent in it. But this is to say: God changes because of the perfection of His intentions. His agency, His power, are direct expressions of his perfection. (If this is not the case, the Ontological Argument is no help to Hartshorne's theology. ) I waive consideration of (A) and proceed to raise some ques tions concerning (B). If I understand Hartshorne, he is saying something like this: If God changes He changes only and absolutely as a necessary existent changes. What this mode of change is surely cannot be learned from the changes of contingent existents. Even if one granted that the existent entity is actually a momentary phase of process, one could not say, "Aha! thus every existent changes!" and include God in the class of every existent; because God is the sole and absolute existent whose being is really cumulative. Now how could one hope to learn how a necessary existent changes? Formally, from the a priori specifications of necessary being. According to Hartshorne, such specifications include: openness to all possibilities; and, responsiveness to all existents. As to the latter, Hartshorne says that if the world grows then God must grow; but I do not suppose he means to say "growth" is the same in both cases, even though he may have in mind as paradigm the increment of aesthetic value experience brings to a sensitive</page><page sequence="11">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 759 person. For the theist God somehow guides the growth, rather than merely showing up to enjoy the harvest. In the changing world, God's guidance is somehow efficacious, perhaps even decisive, because God is wholly present in every moment of the world's story. Hartshorne believes that God is therefore properly characterized as containing potentiality. Reduced to the barest outline Hartshorne's argument seems to me to be this: Whatever is related to a contingent being must itself be potential. The demonstration: (1) To say X is contingent is to say it might or might not exist; so if X exists now it may cease to exist and if it does not now exist it may exist at some future time. (2) Any being (Y) really related to X niust have some potentiality, that is, some capacity for change, because if X ceases to exist, Y is no longer related to it, and if X comes to exist, Y is accordingly modified. (3) If the "world" (the sum of all X's) is necessary, it and God are identical. If the world is contingent, God ("perfec tion") must himself contain potentiality. This argument inspires a refutation, as follows: (1) If God is necessary being, He cannot contain potentiality, because whatever is subject to change in Him must be changed either by Himself or by another. (2) God cannot be the cause of any such changes in Himself, for two reasons: (A) Whatever God proposes to do to Himself cannot be either perfect or necessary; for if it were either, it would already exist?unless the Ontological Argument is invalid. (B) The criterion governing His decision to improve upon Himself, and governing His actual performance, must be either external to and independent of Himself, such as a moral order in which He lives; or the criterion is His own being. It cannot be the former since it is God who necessarily exists by reason of perfec tion. But it cannot be the latter, that is, His own being, since the criterion cannot be at once perfect and non-existent (that is, either abstract or potential). Hence we conclude that God cannot stand</page><page sequence="12">760 JULIAN HARTT to His own activity as criterion to aspiration or performance, if so to stand or be assumes any degree or mode of non-existence. Hartshorne's argument is a clean break not only with tra ditional theism but also with the metaphysical bias of traditional theism in favor of Being over Becoming. His rejection of this bias controls his drastic revision of the theistic view of God's relation to the world. To take the place of the traditional bias he proposes his own ontological principle: Becoming can include Being with out penalty to either, but Being cannot include Becoming without penalty to both. In this abstract form Hartshorne's principle does not seem quite clear. This is the fault, largely, of "include." "To be included" surely cannot mean "to be a case or instance of"? "entity" is hardly an instance of "change." Granted that the inverse is hardly more attractive: "change" is an instance of "entity." But why should we begin by supposing that either is to be included in the other, if this is what "included" means? Perhaps each has a zone and rule of application to whatever is, rather than to the other qua category. (Indeed categoreal sub sumptions would seem to be analytical errors.) If this is so, then neither Becoming nor Being has exclusive title to the ground floor; and the question would still be open whether there is one being to which change could be attributed only on pain of contradiction. Traditional theism says God is just such a being. Hartshorne says that God must change in order to be concretely real. Hartshorne agrees with the Tradition that, if the Ontological Argument is valid the supreme perfection must be supposed to exist in its own right, that is by virtue of its being exactly and solely what it is and not as the farthest conceivable concretion of a tendency spread across the whole range of entities. Such a being requires nothing other than itself to be itself. Therefore the relation of such a being to anything other than itself cannot be specified by any other being whatever. In one or more senses God is, in any moment, what every other being strives to become; that is, in one or more senses beyond His being perfectly agreeable to the realization of value. It is in realization to possibility that Hartshorne seeks to make further inroads on traditional theism. He begins here by agreeing</page><page sequence="13">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 761 that God is not a product of chance; and He is, (and not merely enjoys), every perfection of being; and so far as "possibles" can be supposed to be something rather than nothing, God masters them, that is, (at the least) knows them perfectly. But this mastery goes farther than this. God as creator "is constituent in every possibility" (p. 137). Hartshorne does not mean that God is creator absolutely of possibilities, any more than He is creator of actualities. So far as we might reasonably suppose Leibniz speaks for traditional theism when he says God creates both essence and existence, so far Hartshorne breaks with the tradition. But suppose that there is no realm of "possibles," in God or elsewhere or otherwise; and that a "possible" is a loose way of speaking of contingent statements, thus : X may happen or it may not, so that even if it turns out that X had to happen, it was not nonsense before it happened to say that it might or might not happen. Even if all things happen because they must happen that way and they happen that way because God will not permit them to happen any other way, it does not follow and it cannot be the case that every statement of fact is a necessary truth for God. So let us say that the "realm of possibles" dissolves into the world of contingently existing beings. That these beings have real futures and real freedom to make decisions relative to those futures, are facts which are to be related to necessary being as necessary being is not related to them; which is to say that if anything other than God exists, it exists contingently. It follows that the future cannot be real for necessary and contingent beings in the same way. The future is "real" for everything that exists in time; and some beings may be free to become what they will to become.1 But we cannot suppose that God's relation to Time and Freedom is on an analogical footing with ourselves. The human mind has access to the future only in imagination. This is a real access only if the future comes out in any particular as imagined. We judge the reality of the imagination's grasp upon 1 For freedom is best conceived as an aspect of decision rather than as the spontaneity with which an entity moves from one place or condition to the next. Hartshorne has not convinced me that sub-atomic particles can be said to be free in anything like the way in which we say a person is free.</page><page sequence="14">762 JULIAN HARTT the future always after the fact; and such judgment is not a notable addition to the storehouse of significant truth. (There is another "future," for that matter, the psychological condition of expectation, but as such it is as much a detail of the present as the act of memory is when and as it occurs.) Now it seems to me that we should not have said much if we were to say that God imagines what will happen, what at any moment is future. If it is to happen without His agency He will be as surprised as anybody by the way it turns out, unless He knows in every moment all the relevant possibilities. We have found reason to dismiss that sense of possibility. So God's knowledge of events is exactly contemporaneous with the knowledge of events enjoyed by all other minds. If this is the case, must we not con clude that to speak of God as wise is either an odd way of speaking of divine perfection in the abstract, or it is to speak of the way He marshals the powers of creative good in anticipation of the actual course of events? In the latter case we should say that God has policies as well as ideals and He is quite unbelievably shrewd in the enactment of these policies. To speak of God's enactment of policies and aims is again to raise the issue of God's agency. Must not Hartshorne's God "enact" His policies only by negotiating, lobbying, persuading? The metaphors are whimsical, and Hartshorne is not to be blamed for all of them. That God is on the scene forever and does not need to be dejected because He fails to win with one generation, does not in the least alter the logic of His situation. It does not, that is, give Him powers tomorrow He cannot command today. On Hartshorne's terms God's experience thickens as time rolls on; but this does not mean that God's powers are concomitantly augmented. God's "memory" is perfect; His "intentions" are unimpeachable; but does He really have "intentions," does He really have a will, does he really decide anything? "Memory" is no less anthropomorphic than "will." If "will" must go, as Spinoza so forcefully argued, then we must commit "memory" to the same metaphysical ash-can. I think Hartshorne works steadily from the model of the self whenever he is dealing with causation understood as agency. This accounts for the prominence "memory," "aspiration," etc., enjoy in</page><page sequence="15">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 763 his system. So his view of God's relation to the world works with the paradigm of a good man applying his wisdom and moral con cern to the unpredictable eventualities of an open universe. This view suffers from two qualifications, one of which is a consequence of his view of the finite self. The other is Hartshorne's own ver sion of analogical attribution. I shall discuss them in this order. Hartshorne believes that the "person" is actually a succession of selves (or self-phases) rather than an entity perduring in identity across time. Thus the fifty-year-old man and his boyhood are not identical; the man is literally no longer the child. This does not mean that Hartshorne rejects such continuities as experience actually discloses, but he does not believe that the substantial self of classical metaphysics is either necessary or possible as an explanation of these continuities of experience. In the place of the "ghost in the machine" neo-classical metaphysics offers the persistence of generic traits and qualitative achievements as "influence" emanating from one state of an organism into a successive state. A state of the organism is the consensus of the constituents, its "cells." This appears to make the "cell" the real agent: the entity upon which influences fall, the one for which the "ideal" is significant, the one by which "decisions" are made, and through which the past is communicated to the future. In certain vital respects the organismic model does not seem viable. Biological organisms are built up from cells; and certainly the cells acquire "group functions," but they do the acquiring; and when cells break down and cannot be either rehabilitated or replaced, the organism and all its corporate functions and qualities go to pot. It must also be said that a "person" is not an "organism" no matter how intimately his most humanly essential actions and features are related to organic (physical) constituents. The sole character of Camus' The Fall, Cl?mence, one dark stormy night on a bridge in Paris refused to go to the rescue of a woman who had jumped into the river. Cl?mence decided; it was not put to a vote of the cells, they were not consulted. And it is Cl?mence who is haunted by the sound of a woman's laughter forever there after. True, we have not yet identified what "Cl?mence" names,</page><page sequence="16">764 JULIAN HARTT but it does not seem likely to me that one of the prime candidates will be an organism whose cells somehow achieve a consensus and legislate a moral decision. I do not believe that Hartshorne's account of the person, its persistence and its power, is adequate in detail or correct in prin ciple. Specifically it does not explain either memory or self-deter mination. As to the latter, the inclusive, "all-increasing purpose" by which a person lives has a formal identity immersed in the welter of facts. If that formal identity is lacking, or is seriously defective, the person himself lacks something of power and free dom. As to memory, a formal identity is also involved, but it is an identity of essence forever freed of any other factuality except the act of memory itself. The once-for-allness of memory is only secondarily and superficially reducible to a proposition, e.g., it is forever true that Brutus stabbed Caesar. The proposition has very little, if anything, to do with memory. Memory does not grasp the proposition, it creates (or extracts) an essence from the fact.2 This essence is available only to the person who experienced the fact. Essences of this order are prime constituents of the person; and his access to them, and their power in his life, are aspects?presuppositions, perhaps we should say?of his per durability across time and change. It does not follow that God's formal features are to be under stood as somehow analogical to the prime formalities of human existence. At this point Hartshorne introduces his own qualifica tion into the paradigm of the self. Now he says that theism quite properly instructs us to proceed from God to man, from the perfec tion of personal existence in (as, better) God to its enormously diminished human expression (cf. pp. 140-143). Thus the perfec tions of knowledge, memory, and love must be literally attributed to God and analogically attributed to man ! He proceeds forthwith to qualify the qualification: these are purely analytical specifications, they are attributions entailed by the "idea" of divine perfection; and we have no notion of how God actually exists and operates in any such particular. 2 Not that a proposition is excluded on principle from becoming an essence. Perhaps "P is Q" is remembered in joy, sorrow, fondness, etc.</page><page sequence="17">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 765 The concrete knowledge of God, God in relation to the world, must, it now appears, be gathered in some other way. I should like to put the matter thus : The attributes of God so far as He acts, rather than subsists in splendidly absolute abstractness, can be derived only from His action and not from truistic principles. Such attributes must be discerned as the properties of an agent. They are not descriptions of states of affairs. Hence if we say "God is love" in the modality of agent-acting, it must be because some event, or some shape of things, can be explained only as the effect of such an agent. If in this same modality we say "God is righteous" it must be because He is discerned as one putting things to rights. So far as the logic of attribution is concerned, it makes no difference whether we say "believed" rather than "discerned." So far as the larger and looser logic of metaphysical system is concerned, it makes a great deal of difference whether we say "discerned" or "believed." The System cannot rest its weight upon "beliefs"; it must have truths attested as such by the norms included in the appropriate modality of discourse. And here is the final, as well as initial, difficulty that Hartshorne's system creates for me: he proposes to rest the meta physics of theism upon truistic principles; and I do not see how he can derive the rest of the system from them or how the "action coefficients" of the system are to be instructed by them. Certainly the religious inspiration of theism is much more nearly and patently hinted in "God so loved the world" than in a conception of divine perfection so universal that no particular fact is excluded. Logical exclusions and inclusions are at best remote relatives of moral ones. IV Thus we come at last to Hartshorne's view of the relation of theistic metaphysics to religion and religious experience. On this topic his most passionate avowal concerns the absolute responsive ness of God to the situation of the creature. Hartshorne reads the theological signals flying today as largely favorable to his doctrine of divine potentiality?the "passability" of God, to use the ancient term. He contends that God must be affected by his creatures if he really loves them. "Life" and "Love" thus conspire to force</page><page sequence="18">766 JULIAN HARTT a revision of one of the most venerable of traditional divine attributes, immutability. The high moral seriousness of this argument, and some of its poetic promise, are indeed impressive. I am not convinced that he has come forward with the adequate reasons for assimilating these convictions with the notion of God as necessary being. Granted that the perfection of an existent with moral features can not be static. This does not yet indicate what perfection of power God, as such a being, enjoys. What can God do about the suffer ing of his beloved, in addition to feeling their tragic plight? Or does He know their situation as being tragic? If it is tragic and He does not know this, He is not God. If it is not really tragic, the reason why it is not must lie with Him; and it must be His own being. According to Hartshorne, God saves what is salvageable in his creatures; with Him they are everlastingly secure; which is to say, in the measureless amplitude and precision of His memory they are forever lodged. But how is the goodness of being thus guaranteed? Moreover, to know that one will be forever remembered is hardly a motivation to seek good rather than evil, though one ought to be grateful for that much consideration in the courts of heaven. This but reminds us that God's participation in the moral struggle is very unlike our own: God cannot die, He has nothing to lose, and nothing can arise to dim or weaken his love of the good. So even Epicurus. The theistic version of this must implicate God in the realization of the good, wherever it is realized; but not as a being who must learn from the struggle how it is, or will be, resolved. God has no doubt about the outcome, not because He counts on Himself to do the best He can but because the whole cosmic process is within His power and is an expression of the perfection of His own being. Hartshorne will not have it this way. In his view God must do the best he can with realities he enjoys but does not command. It occurs to me that such a God might well share the sufferings of lesser beings, since he can offer them but the perfection of an ideality which will always be what it is no matter how wretched the world and grim the passage of spirit through it. What Hartshorne is aiming at is not, I suppose, the imme</page><page sequence="19">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 767 diacies of religious experience, but the intellectual mish-mash which he takes Christian theology to be. (cf. p. 123) On the level of immediacy a religious person prays on the clear assumption and good hope that God so petitioned will do something, or permit or empower him who prays to do something, which otherwise would not (or, perhaps, even could not) have occurred. Thence to a practical dilemma: (a) the prayer "makes a difference" even to God, in which case God changes; (b) or the prayer does not make a difference to God, in which case no good reason can be found for so praying in the first place. Several observations might be made about this dilemma. (1) Some types of prayer do not ask God for any changes in the state of the world, e.g., a prayer of thanksgiving. (2) One might believe with some theologians, that "from eternity" God determines to produce some effects by the prayers of the faithful who are accordingly inspired by Him to pray for the right thing at the right time. This may be an odd thing to believe. I suppose that some of the people who believe it do so because of a religious encounter rather than a metaphysical-theological argument. Hartshorne's concern for the religious life leads him to worship rather than to prayer as the prime religious reality. He understands worship to mean absolute and total love for a being; and from this concludes that "perfection" is the character such a being "must have to make sense out of this" (p. 40). It is noteworthy, I think, that Hartshorne's appeal to the religious is so largely to the "attitudinal," even in so vital a matter as worship. Why is he so sure that in worship the religious person doesn't already know what God is in all His perfection; and already therefore knows how to "make sense," not so much of worship but of the world? I suspect that the answer to this ques tion follows from a negative answer to the question whether "religious experience" can be said to have any cognitive value of its own. If we agree that "religious experience" has no cognitive value, neither the credibility nor the cogency of a metaphysical claim is enhanced by appealing to religion. To be sure, religious</page><page sequence="20">768 JULIAN HAR7T people might derive assurance of some sort from metaphysical (theistic) achievements: if the metaphysical doctors say that one is permitted to believe something one already embraces as true, certainly some anxiety or dubiety must thereby be relieved. But the relationship is asymmetrical, so far: the metaphysician may acquire a problem from the pious (even though the pious are not troubled by it), but not a solution. If, on the other hand, one says that religion does have cognitive value, then metaphysical claims may require modification by a religious cognition. To make matters even worse, "religious experience" may be in a position to file its own "metaphysical" claims. Hartshorne does not seem to take this possibility very seriously. He believes, I think, that religious people must look to metaphysics for knowledge of God rather (merely) than for logical clarification of their beliefs. If we accept this, are we not encour aging the philosopher to divide the spoils: "cognition" to the logically ordered Reason, and "poetry" to the Heart? This would be an odd, or even shocking, result for a view of things which so heavily capitalizes "feeling" as a metaphysical prime, as Hart shorne's does. Hartshorne is more concerned to discover religious resonances in metaphysical truths, than he is to see metaphysics corrected by a religious cognition. Chapter XII is entitled "Some Empty Though Important Truths." The necessary truths about divine perfection have a beauty of their own. He says: The beauty may be thin, like that of mathematical ideas, wholly lacking in sensuous richness or concreteness, but in its way it is real. All acts of attention must achieve some sort of value, and the only value a necessary entity can provide is that of sheer contemplation of an object which is satisfying simply as object, as something con templated, (p. 288) A little later he says: To be vividly conscious of the full truistic meaning or value of existence as such is to have a better chance of noting well and steadily the non-truistic or contingent meanings or values, (p. 289) This strikes me as a psychological generalization. It is not suspect for that; but as such it does not yield even a hint of the process by which we may pass logically from the truistically true about God</page><page sequence="21">THE LOGIC OF PERFECTION 769 to the contingently true about the world and thence to the con tingently true about God. Nor are we thus instructed on what God himself acquires from His knowledge of the truistically true for His own guidance (rather than enjoyment) in dealing with the actual world. To put the issue somewhat more abruptly : the contemplation of truistically true statements about divine perfection strikes me as having very thin meaning for the religious life, unless one can show that the truistically true generates empirical knowledge of God or somehow makes clear and positive contact with an empirical knowledge of God. Perfection as Hartshorne conceives it might serve as an intellectual logical criterion for a whole order of religious assertions about God. He has not indicated how this might work; but I confess that I cannot see the truistically true as either the logical ground for or religious generator of religiously rich assertions about God. It is of course possible to make up one's mind that there is no reliable access to anything in particular an actually existing God does; and thereafter one may settle religiously for contemplation of the generic features of being so far as these are made available by analytic propositions. I do not think this is very far: the logical modality of necessity does not supply knowledge of the properties and powers of the existent at any level of "perfection." Y The neo-classical systematic program works with an extract (rather than a distillate) of Religion. Unless one had already shown that any particular religion was an expression of such an "essence," one would not have brought fundamental illumination to any religious claim or hope by developing the logical properties of that extract. This is not quite Hartshorne's situation. His account of the transitoriness of the human self in the cosmos does indeed tilt neo-classical theism towards neo-Buddhism, except for the odd detail of the divine memory. This detail may add a measure of dignity to human existence. It does not appear to me to add power either to God or man for the realization of the good. I confess it does not seem to add any remarkable richness to the religious quest. Yde Uni?ersityt</page></plain_text>
