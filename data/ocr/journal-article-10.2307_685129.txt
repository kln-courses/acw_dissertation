WITHERS I: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE ON THE RHEOLOGY OF COMPLEX ALLOYS AND ITS PHILOSOPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE A. GRAHAM i Introduction COMPONENTs of machines, such as aircraft or gas turbines, may be made from complex alloys that contain perhaps ten elements, all of which affect their mechanical properties. In service use, the loading and temperature of the alloys vary in a rather arbitrary manner, and the many problems of designing to avoid failure in service are tackled by the industry mainly by the methods of direct development. These obviously lead to successful results, buttheyare expensive and laborious. In a government research laboratory, individuals are less closely in contact with development experience than in industry and, if concerned with the problem, are at once impelled and more free to take up back- ground research into problems of mechanical properties that are com- mon to the class of commercial alloys with which the industry as a whole is concerned. Such a research poses the problem of providing systematic descriptions of the rheological behaviour of materials that are regarded by both industry and the academic world as being too complex for systematic and exact description. Although the view that rheological behaviour is complex derives legitimately from the fact that it is concerned with the interplay of at least four independent variables, namely, stress, strain, time, and temp- erature, mechanical properties are governed by overall averages of avery large number of microscopic effects, and averages are invariably simpler * Symposium at the Conference of Rheology, Manchester, 6-8 April, 196o 265</page><page sequence="2">A. GRAHAM than the myriad details. Moreover, certain regularities that appeared in the published results of the rather small group of engineers that have studied the mechanical properties as a subject in itself suggested that if behaviour were systematically studied in terms of these four variables it would be found to be essentially simple.' The chance that appear- ances were genuine has led the author and his colleagues to spend about ten years in unravelling a tangled skein of regulanty and to reach and support the conclusion that mechanical behaviour is no less ordered than other and better-understood aspects of nature. Acknowledge- ment is especially due to the contribution of Mr K. F. A. Walles. The method followed has been the converse of that which is custo- mary. Instead of progressively narrowing down and idealisurg the field of interest in direct pursuit of exact ideas, a search has been made for trends over the widest practicable extension of the field. A general mathematical principle has been progressively circumscribed to express the trends. The regularities found are of a rather unexpected nature, and it is not perhaps surprising that the work has been labelled as merely empirical ' and without significance on one assessment and as 'academic and artificial ' on another. In the present paper the nature of the regularities and of the experimental support for them are illu- strated, and a discussion is offered of the fallacies of such general assessments. 2 Results Certain ideas in the macro-rheology of metals run very close to ideas that have been put forward and developed in the field of non- metals by Dr G. W. Scott Blair and his colleagues. The present work stems from this double root, and it supports and extends a number of his conclusions. The regularities centre about an equation E = CortK put forward by Nutting in 1921 to represent the creep strain E of pitch at time t when loaded with a constant stress a. The quantities P and K are numerical constants and C depends upon the temperature. In order to take account of the experimental fact that behaviour cannot in general be represented by an algebraic equation of this kind, for the strain depends not only upon the instantaneous stress but also upon the way the stress has previously varied with time, the Nutting 1 A.

The equation is thereby made invanant with respect to time. The equation is allied to the fractional form 1 that Scott Blair has advocated. It represents an addition of elementary 'creep processes' which originate individually, with each increment of (af), at the instant each such increment occurs. Each contributes thereafter a progressively changing increment of strain. For particular ' paths of loading ', with a as a function of t, as for example in ideal creep testing with stress constant, the equation reduces to the Nutting equation with an appropriate constant factor. The experimental support for this result shows that the use of an algebraic equation is legitimate when the loading path is fixed. If attention is now confined to a particular loading path, the strain is not in generalrepresented bya single Nutting term,but by the sum of a series of Nutting terms, thus E = CluAl tjK + Ca 0 tK2 + . .. The regularities of especial interest, which the detailed studies have rather fully confirmed,2 is that the exponents K and P take only particu- lar values. When the stress is constant for example, the exponents K take values only from a sequence based upon the powers of 3, namely (1),1 I, 3,(9), and the ratios of K to t take values only from a sequence based upon the powers of 2, namely, , 2' 4' 8' 16 This algebraic formula is a straightforward inference from experimental results. The general formula contains a sum of integrals like the right- hand member of the second equation with the appropriate fractional values of K and K/f. These regularities are seldom manifest immediately in experi- mental data on account of its scatter, limited range, and generally poor sampling, and because the effects of more than one term are generally superimposed. In favourable circumstances one or two terms pre- dominate over the remainder: the fractional exponents are then closely 1 A. Graham, G. W Scott Blair, Discussion of paper by H. McCallion and D. M.

In other circumstances, their validity must be established by detailed analyses joined to an assessment of significance in terms of the confidence limits of the data.' The crucial test 1 has been to show that the laws lead to successful extrapolations of creep data over considerable ranges in time, for different sets of data grouped together to provide sigmficant samples. It appears from this work that the complexities of mechanical prop- erties have less to do with the complexities of composition than with the presence of four variables and with the considerable range of these variables over which the pattern of regularity is extended. The for- mula can best be regarded as offering a rather high ratio of experi- mental facts co-ordinated to hypotheses made; the two series of standard exponents however appear to be, in some sense, fundamental. 3 ' Fundamental ' versus ' Empirical ' These conclusions are opposed to the view that it is almost incon- ceivable that all the complex phenomena concerned can have any simple explanation; that the phenomenological method that has been followed is mere curve-fitting without significance; that merely to represent results by a formula does not meet the essential need of explanation; that work on commercial alloys is necessarily empirical; that progress can only be made by fundamental studies; that only work on pure metals and simple alloys can be fundamental; that a fundamental result must be based upon atomic factors ; that fractional power laws are merely empirical ; that only integral powers and expo- nentials can be fundamental; and so on. The list is probably long enough for illustration. Most of these problems centre on the significance of the term 'fundamental'; and they appear to involve old controversics that have been well fought over in the past. The term 'fundamental ' has clearly both a scientific and a metaphysical connotation. Scientifically, a fundamental result or principle is one that is common to a wide range of experimental conditions and on the basis of which a wide range of results may be predicted. A metaphysical connotation is involved when the common principle is regarded as a fact of nature and as an absolute truth. If one adopts the scientific viewpoint, then an important considera- tnon is that whether a result is empirical or fundamental depend. 1 Work to be published 268</page><page sequence="5">EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE entirely upon the point of view. An experimental uniformity of behaviour such as the present can be regarded either as an empirical target for prediction on the basis of hypotheses made on the atomic scale of magnitudes, or as offering itself the fundamental hypotheses for some field theory of the macroscopic scale of magnitudes. Those who are primarily interested in atomic phenomena are thus liable to make the opposite assessment to those who, like the author, are con- cerned with behaviour on the scale of engineering. A great deal of confusion can arise from the fact that the two groups of research workers stand back to back, on a common result, and face m opposite directions. Another source of confusion can arise from the fact that any science has two distinct phases with an essentially inverse relationship between them, namely, a formative phase and a development phase. The form- ative phase consists of mductive, analytical, and often disjointed detec- tive work, in which one possibility is tried after another in a search for unifying principles and basic elements. It is not strictly logical m a classical sense and involves working inwards, from an imagined genera- lity spread over a range of personal experience, along the lines of greatest probability, towards a centre. When success is achieved, however, there is a complete change of procedure. The stage of formal development then follows in which the principles and elements are taken by definition as flundamental, and the science then develops outward and backward along the general course by which it came. A great deal of misunderstanding can arise between those who are working outwards from familiar basic principles they accept without question and those who work inwards also, and are prepared to enter- tain some adaptation of basic prmnnciples. The necessity for such an adaptation in rheology is clear from the fact that, as Scott Blair has pointed out, some rheological properties are not physical properties m the ordinary sense of the term, for they are altered by the process of measurement. Another source of difficulty is the canonimsation of hypotheses: a promotion of respected hypotheses that have successfully co-ordinated a limited range of experience to the status of fundamental truths that must be preserved inviolate throughout all reasoning. In the present context, the hypotheses that appear to have been canorused are those that give rise to exponential laws and integral power laws. Canonisa- tion evidently arises in the transference of ideas from master to pupil. 269</page><page sequence="6">A. GRAHAM It inhibits thought because, in comparison, every other consideration is made trivial. Experience shows of course that the most revered hypo- thesis of one age and field of study turns out later to be only a limited part, or special case, of a wider concept. A tendency to canomse is particularly associated with the concept of purity. The view exists, although fortunately it is dying, that work on pure materials is more scientific-more valid-than work on everyday matenals. It is evidently a vestigial survival from the time when those who would now be called scientists studied the heavens, which were believed to be perfect and unchangeable, and tried to relate the best on this earth to the infinite. The mud, cheese, and metal, of present day rheology were earth-bound and profane. The present results cast doubt upon whether purity as such has any rheological significance. 4 A philosophy of the Phenomenological Method The philosophy of the early days of quantum mechanics, of the Jeans-Schrodinger-Eddington-Stebbmg period, appears to be a valu- able guide to the labour of developing rheology from a craft into a science. One of the lessons that was learned with great difficulty, but all the more firmly m that period was the futility of attempting to visualise, in any final detail, the ultimate structure of matter in terms of the familiar pushes and pulls, billiard balls, and so called realities of everyday experience. Atoms, electrons, and the like were derived concepts, and had the status of artefacts which were not to be accorded any real existence in their own right. The busminess of exact science was to deal in observables alone-with the numerical results of experiment- and to specify numencally the experimental relationships between ob- servables. A scientific theory consisted of mathematical symbols, opera- tional rules for transforming one symbol into another, and a set of rules for interpreting results in terms of observables. Physical pictures and models were either scaffolding or metaphysics. Whether this is the only valid workaday philosophy of science is a matter for debate, but at least it enabled atominuc theory to escape from the trammels of its anthropomorphic ongins. It is also the philosophy of the phenomenological method that has led to the present results. The philosophy is especially rejected by those who are fascinated by the various physical events that maybe seen to happen before their very eyes; but the visual-model approach appears to belong to the early formative period of enquiry. The quantum-mechanical philosophy appears to be 270</page><page sequence="7">EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE adopted without difficulty in the later development period. Those who describe the rheology of metals in terms of patterns of dislocations, for example, readily transfer to the highly-formal theory of elasticity and Newton's laws of motion. The work here in review shows that pro- gress can be made by a direct search for the mathematical expressions that adequately represent a class of experimental graph, and for the mathematical operations that enable passage to be made from one experimental graph to another. To attempt to rank this procedure on a fundamental versus empirical evaluation is to obliterate all discussion with the metaphysical positive and negative infinities ofa ' fundamental truth ' and ' merely empirical device'; and it is quite unscientific. 5 An application of the Phenomenological Method The view that research is a study of relationships rather than a pur- suit of absolute truth permits a greater mobility of speculation. For example, the second equation E = (t_- t)"K dt 0 dt is a particular case of the general principle of linear superposition accord- ing to which any behaviour or function may be regarded as being composed of a distributed sum of repetitions of a unit behaviour or function treated as indivisible entities on a smaller scale of magnitudes. The 'unit function ', tK 11 the above expression, may be any physical function whatever, and the ' unit cause ' (dofi/dt) dt may be any physical cause. The situation in nature to wluch the equation corresponds ap- pears at first sight to be more akin to biological growth than to mani- mate physical change-more akin to the growth of an organism by a progressive aggregation of parts with each part itself growing and changing in a uniform and characteristic manner. The distinction between biological growth and iuanimate physical change is unlikely to be a genuine one, however, for rheology and biology are both con- cerncd with rcgroupings and rearrangements of the same kinds of atoms. The biological parallel illustrates in passing thdie common misconception that worthwhile and reliable theories can only be built up from con- sideration of the behaviour of atoms. The biological parallel is by no means fancifuil or Irrelevant. While discussing with Dr Scott Blair the mathematical bases of the power law, he drew my attention to an argument mn a paper by von Bertalanffy 271</page><page sequence="8">G. W. SCOTT BLAIR which appears to have originated with Julian Huxley. Huxley was interested in the ratio of sizes of two parts of the same growing animal; and he showed that if two independent quantities each growing exponen- tially are compared, then the ratio of their magnitudes at any instant follows a power relation. He supported the biological power law of relative growth by many examples from different animals. A simple ad- aptation of his argument leads to a similar sequence of exponents to those encountered, as previously mentioned, in the study of complex alloys. In the comparisons of body size that led him to the power law, Huxley was concerned with the relative size of one finite part of an animal, say a claw, with the size of another finite part, say the shell, each being regarded as a uniformly-growmg whole. He then discusses the case in which there is a progressive change of growth distributed over the animal, and quotes D'Arcy Thompson's observation that the forms of different species of fish or of different species of crab are geo- metrically related to one another by a regular Cartesian transformation. It appears, as Huxely remarks, that the different species have diverged in their evolution by the differing development of growth tendencies centred in different parts of the animal. The use that Huxley and his successors have made of this reasoning may have a special rheological significance. The results offer a mathe- matical analogue, and perhaps even an actual equivalence in a chemical sense, between the deformation of an inanimate body in a mechamcal environment and the changing form of a developing organism in a biological environment.

Anyone who rejects philosophy is unconsciously practismg a philosophy.' 1 INDEED it seems that those physicists who most hotly deny having any philosophy are inclined to to be the first to condemn new ideas which contravene their own metaphysical presuppositions and such prejudices serve as hindrances to the development of the younger branches of physics. Although the mechanistic beliefs of the nineteenth century are no longer accepted consciously, many physicists have not yet fully grasped the implications of the change in outlook. As Bridgman2 has put it: Many will discover'in themselves a longing for mechanical explanation which has all the tenacity of original sin . .. Just as the old monks struggled to subdue the flesh, the physicist struggles to subdue thius sometimes nearly irresistible, but perfectly unjustifiable desire. The new outlook has been well expressed by Johnson S: If symbols however indeterminate can be fitted together in functional form and in equations predicting what actually happens, we regard with tolerant but superior agnosticism our ancestors' desire to label those symbols and attach them to pictures of 'things' behaving as little miniatures of large-scale characters or bodies. But many physicists have hardly yet reached this stage. We have no precise definition for science as a whole, but for a description of the scope of intelligent scientific activity, one might well combine two well-known definitions, the one of intelligence and the other of science. Science is concerned with perceiving relations between those elements of our experience which are common or potentially common to all normal people. Rheology is a branch of physics which deals with the deformation and flow of matter. As in other branches of physical science, there are four principal kinds of relation which we try to establish. (a) Relations between the behaviour ofgross matter and that of its molecular or atomic constituents. Rubber is believed to contract elastically because of its long chain molecules, pivoted to rotate at a certain angle, and buffeted about by neighbouring molecules into chance configurations. This model enables us to calculate the elastic behaviour of rubber at various temperatures. In a sense, this model is like the system of wheels 1 K. Jaspers, The Way to Wisdom, London, 195I 2 P.

SCOTT BLAIR in Mr Withers's black box (see p. 282), but in this case (a), we really believe that there are wheels, just as we believe that there are invisible genes which form parts of the visible chromosomes. We hope to get more and more evidence for their real existence as science progresses. The rheological behaviour of gross matter usually depends on its molecular and atomic structure, so this type of relation is most valuable. In theology, however, it is not always possible to find such relations, nor is it right to assume that all aspects of macrorheological behaviour are always entirely dependent on molecular or atomic structure. As an extreme case, two samples of sand, chemically identical, will behave quite differently when subjected to the same stresses if their particle size distributions differ appreciably. The finenessofgrinding of clays much affects their plasticity. Here the causes may be partly at a molecular level, though certainly not entirely so. (b) Relationships between the behaviour of gross matter and that of other simple systems (models) which follow approximately the same equations, where no causal link exists. We can observe light only when it is associated with matter and, in certain expenments, light then behaves like a wave. In certain experiments milk curd behaves like a particular system of viscous and elastic elements called, by rheologists, ' a Burgers Body' and shown in Figure i (see Scott Blair and Burnett 1). f71 G1 ???: ?'.i; ..:. .:~~: ??? ?? ???? ??? .????? ?????? ????? ???? ???? ????? =.?== ~ t~t =?....... 5~ .f.. ... 5"? .... ???? ????? 772 FIG.

Phys , 1959, 1o, I5 274</page><page sequence="11">NEW OUTLOOKS IN RHEOLOGY (c) Relationships between phenomena which at first sight appear quite unconnected, but which are, in fact, linked, although no 'cause' is lknown: e.g. the forces which keep planets in their orbits and those that cause apples to fall to the earth. Such relationships are not common in rheology. (d) Relationships between the behaviour of matter under varying inten- sities ofthe same or comparable physical stimuli. Under certain conditions, if we increase the stress on a milk gel, the strain which recovers when the stress is removed will increase proportionally.' Hence, as Mr Withers points out, we can calculate a useful rigidity modulus from many different observations. Under other conditions, the rate of strain is proportional to stress and a viscosity is a useful and meaningful entity. Some rheologists dogmatically believe that one or other of these, generally (a) and (b), are the only 'sound' types of relation in our Science.2 Enormously valuable as their contributions have been, this is just not true. Few rheologists stick entirely to type (a)-there are far too many phenomena for which an explanation cannot be offered m molecular terms. Type (b) explanations are accepted so long as the 'wheels ' consist of ideally elastic (Hookean) springs, perfectly viscous (Newtonian) dashpots 3 and (St Venant) sliders, representing static fric- tion. Nor is one supposed to believe that these ' parts ' really do exist. This is similar to the situation with respect to some of the complicated machinery of pre-Copernican cosmology. As with epicycles, so with dashpots and springs: if we postulate enough of them, we can always account for any experimental situation. Spring and dashpot models lead to exponential equations, which, in the simplest cases, means that stresses will relax at constant strain and strains will build up under constant stress at rates proportional to them- selves at any moment of time. The rates do not depend on the earlier stages of the experiment, since the moduli and viscosities remain con- stant. If, m fact, in more complex matenals, the process of stressing or straining is altering the values of these properties, the simplest assump- tion would surely be to suppose that, in straining under constant stress, 1 Ibid. 2 Two American authors have recently shown much concern that they are not able completely to describe the behaviour of sand-water nuxtures in terms of atomic arrangements.

SCOTT BLAIR for example, the rate of strain, dE/dt,' would be proportional not to the strain at time t but to the average rate of strain since the time when the straining started, or dE E oc - dt t and this is a power equation. Writing a for the constant stress and k for a fractional exponent (normally I &gt; k &gt; o) we have: E = Atk and this equation does not give invariant magnitudes for simple pro- perties like viscosities and elastic moduli. Such a ' model' cannot be precisely expressed in terms of springs with Hookean elastic moduli and dashpots with Newtonian viscosities. For a Hookean spring, a oc E, and for a dashpot, , oc . For the many complex materials which follow ddtE power equations, we can write a oc-where I &gt;  &gt; o. Let us compare this type of treatment with the classical exponential treatment. The simplest general model to consider is that of Bur- gers, as shown m Figure i. We may consider either the relaxation of stress at constant strain, or retardation of straining under constant stress.2 Let us consider the former and plot the viscosities of the dashpots in the series ' part of the model (,q,) against the moduli (G,) of the springs. Consider any one sample, X, of a set X, Y, Z. (Fig. 2a). This is placed so that the cartesian co-ordinates represent its shear modulus (G) and its viscosity (q) respectively. If we join X to the origin, then tan 0 will represent its relaxation time. (We can now leave out the suffixes, since the argument applies equally well to retardation times.) Now consider a set A, B, C, of much more complex materials, whose behaviour cannot be easily represented by dashpot-sprmg models. Figure 2b, though superficially similar to 2a, is really very different. Again, one axis represents (stress, ))/(rate of shear, dc/dt) and the other (stress, o-)/(amount ofshear, E), but here the co-ordinates are polar. Vis- cous liquids may be shown as points along the vertical axis and elastic 1 For the sake of simplicity, the same symbols are used for tensile and shear stresses and likewise for stramns. These also conform to the usage m Mr. Graham's paper. This should be easier for the non-rheologist reader, though it is not to be recommended for strictly rheological papers.

This would constitute the error in dimensions of which we are sometimes accused, 277</page><page sequence="14">G. W. SCOTT BLAIR but there would seem to be no record of any rheologist making such a mistake. We can, of course, compare directly any set of samples hav- ing the same value of k (say 0.2, which happens to be a common value for high polymers). In other cases, we must always compare samples in terms of both k and x taken together, i.e. of the position of the points on the diagram. This is a novel idea, but in no way an unsound one. Such samples are too complex in their behaviour to be compared along a single scale. Either they must be defined by a very large and perhaps infiute number of' physical properties ', or they may be compared in terms of their relative positions in a diagram such as that shown in Fig. 2b. If strain and stress are not linearly related so that a stress expo- nent is also needed, they are defined by means of their position within solid figures.1 This method of treating certain data has two principal advantages. First, in many cases, as Scott Blair and others have shown 2,3, in order to obtain comparable goodness of fit, considerably fewer parameters are needed than if a series of exponential terms is used. Secondly, a much closer link is established in this way, with psycho-physical studies of the assessment of rheological properties of industrial materials by handling them. Such subjective assessments will long continue to be of impor- tance in many industries. An earlier account of these ideas was given in a paper in this journal some years ago.' Criticisms on dimensional grounds were ably refuted, at about the same time, by Dmgle.6 A criticism of such methods more serious than that of dimensional inhomogeneity, concerns the definition of differential coefficients of fractional order. A concept of this kind must be precisely definable. One might start, for example, by trying to define the operation diy/dtk su h that, when carried out three times, the result is the same as a single differentiation. But we must then show that the result of applying such an operation is unique, or at least leads to only a limited number of alternatives; and this is not the case. It is better to follow Riemann's integral form of definition (inherent m Mr Graham's treatment) which gives a perfectly consistent and intelligible result for any real fractional order, rational or irrational. 1 G.

(This is a point which was raised by Dedekind.) If we suppose a line, corresponding to a set of samples having the same distances from the origin starting at sin c = o (elastic solid) and gradually rotating towards sin w = I (liquid), this line will pass continuously through all intermediate angles, not only those corresponding to rational fractions. It is unthinkable that there will be some kind of' exclusion principle ' forbidding specified angles. The idea of comparing the behaviour of complex bodies in terms not of distances along a line (a scale), but by their positions in a space of two or more dimensions, is worth further consideration. But it is clear that such treatments will not lead us to simple models of rheo- logical behaviour! It has been objected that the quantities here proposed for the speci- fication of the rheological behaviour of certain materials are not tenso- rial and, therefore, do not have the invanance required of fundamental physical properties. This, of course, depends on what is meant by ' fundamental physical properties '. As a concession, I have felt it best to describe such entities as ' quasi-properties'; though I am not sure whether this concession was really a wise one. There are many situ- ations in physics for which the tensorial type of invanance is highly advantageous, but I cannot see that establishing relations between the rheological behaviour of complex materials is one of them. As an illustration, some elastic materials do not obey Hooke's law over any appreciable range of straining, but a power relation is found to hold between stress and strain (Bach's equation). It is clear that this power equation will not be valid for very small strains, when Hooke's law is probably obeyed. But thus in no way precludes the use of Bach's equation for all but the smallest strains. Another case is the fairly wide use now being made of Casson's equation1 which gives a linear relation between square-root of stress and square root of shear-rate m material flowing through a capillary, or between concentric cylinders. This does not allow of a reversal in the direction of the flow. I would conclude with a word about Mr Withers's type (I) and type (2) explanations (see p. 283). I take it that what I have called (a) and (b) relations offer type (2) explanations, whereas (c) and (d) are of type (i). Sometimes the question whether a model is supposed to represent real 1 N.

Mr Withers asks if there are any hopes of finding some explanation of type (2) class, i.e. perceiving relations of my types (a) or (b) with power laws and fractional differential coefficients. He agrees with me that this is not essential and I agree with him that type (2) explanations have proved so valuable in the past that it would be well worth trying. I feel that Mr Graham's contribution comes nearest to making such a link. I feel pretty sure that if we ever succeed in finding an explana- tion of the type (2) class for the power equations, it will come through the simple mathematical fact that a power equation results from the combination of two exponentials; but I cannot yet see just how this is to be done. Natonal Insttute for Research m Dairying University of Reading III: EXPLANATIONS AND MODELS IN SCIENTIFIC THEORY CONSTRUCTION R. F. J. WITHERS I Introduction THE work of Graham and Scott Blair has been cnriticised in the past on various grounds. Graham has enumerated some of these objections. I want to concentrate on a few of them: (i) That it is inconceivable that all complex phenomena can have a simple explanation. (2) That the phenomenological method that has been followed is mere curve-fitting without significance. (3) That merely to represent results by a formula does not meet the essential need of explanation. (4) That progress can only be made by fundamental studies. (5) That a fundamental result must be based upon atomic factors. These criticisms suggest to me that a discussion of the r6le of generali- sation and explanation m science might be useful with respect to their work and this will also involve a discussion on the r61e of models m scientific theory construction. 280</page><page sequence="17">SCIENTIFIC THEORY CONSTRUCTION My impression is that whenever a controversy over scientific state- ments arises a close examination of the type of statement being discussed and a study of the statement's exact position m the ordered hierarchy of scientific statements focuses the discussion on to the way that that statement is functioning within the scientific theory. To do this is always a profitable pursuit and is one of the main functions of the philosopher of science. 2 Sketch of Statements in a Rheological Theory In order to arrive at some idea of the r61e played by the extension of the Nutting equation m rheology I shall consider a statement of its function as expressed by Scott Blair and Burnett m a paper they pub- lished in 1959. I shall classify the statements made in that paper under the scheme described by Woodger.2 Scott Blair and Burnett reported observation records about what hap- pens when small pressures are applied to one end of a column of ren- neted milk (' curd') m a U-tube and the displacements are magnified a hundred fold by means of an alcohol mdex in a horizontal capillary. At the first stage of the discussion no theoretical terms seem to enter. However, soon the authors calculated the overall shear modulus G. This we are told is calculated from the movement of the alcohol index of recovery h, the density of the manometer liquid p, the radius of the U-tube R; the length of the column of gel L and the radius of the recorder capillary a, from the equation G? R4pg P 8La2 h The overall G can be calculated from an experiment in which the sample is loaded for, say, one minute then allowed to recover for, say, two minutes. The whole of the recovery, almost complete in two minutes, gives us h. In the second type of expenment readings are taken at frequent intervals during the two minutes of recovery and so they calculate a series of unrecovered displacements. This enables G to be divided into two parts, immediate and slow. Now it is obvious that more is involved in tlus procedure than mere observation. The equation from which G has been calculated must I G. W. Scott Blair and J. Burnett, 'On the Creep, Recovery, Relaxation and Elastic " Memory " of some Renneted Milk Gels ', Brit.J.

WITHERS represent some other type of statement in which G is a definition for a complex relationship. Certain of the terms in the equation are also definitions of other relationships. My remarks about G will be appli- cable to these terms. The definition of G is based on a number of observations which suggest a general relationship, a generalisation of observation records, expressed by the nght-hand side of the equation which is believed to exist in a repeatable fashion. The relationship is sufficiently important for it to be abbreviated to the single letter G and to be known as the shear modulus. The authors go on to describe the result of calculatmg four para- meters: the immediate modulus, the delayed modulus, the internal damping viscosity and the external viscosity. They notice that these parameters 'behave approximately as a Burgers body'. It seems to me that the impetus to discovering this behaviour must have come from the use of a model, that of springs and dashpots, suggesting the making of observations about the four parameters that were calculated. The results obtained were the test of the spring and dashpot model, where this was functioning as an explanatory hypothesis suggesting the making of fresh observations. Let us, therefore, consider what is involved m inventing an explanatory hypothesis. If we consider the sort of statements that form explanatory hypo- theses we can see that there are two main types. Let us consider a simple example of a situation requiring explanation. We have a black box with a dial on the front having numerals at various points and two hands which rotate at different speeds. Can we devise an explanation for the behaviour of the hands and in particular can we predict when the hands will coincide and can we perhaps give an estimate of the times on our watches when the coinciding will occur? A scientist could look for an explanation of the behaviour of the hands in two ways. (i) He could calculate the angular velocity of both hands and work out an expression relating the two in such a way that the required prediction can be made. This expression would constitute in one sense an explanation of the behaviour of the hands (I am going to call it a Type 1 explanation). This explanation could tell one a lot about the movements of the two hands and could predict various relation- ships between them. The question I think that might be considered is whether the extension of the Nutting Equation is an example of a Type I explanation. 282</page><page sequence="19">SCIENTIFIC THEORY CONSTRUCTION (ii) Or, a scientist could first remember that he has seen other systems, such as the one he has in the watch on his wrist which he knows contains cogs, balance wheels, springs, and so forth. Using this as a conceptual model he could then invent statements about the presence of such entities inside the black box, and their relationships to one another and their relationships, causally, to the movement of the hands. From these statements he could predict the behaviour of the hands as before. He could also predict, for example, the existence of cogs, etc., as the parts of the black box system. He could make predictions about the number of teeth on the cogs which he suggests exist m the black box and he could test these predictions by opening the black box. Notice what he has done. He has used his own watch as a model system and the statements about the parts of his watch he has trans- ferred to the black box system. This may be successful in predicting the behaviour of the hands but it may be falsified if he finds no cogs inside the box. It may, for example, turn out that the black box is run by electricity using an alternating current. But I suggest that until he has tested his theoryhlus statements about the hypothetical cogs will give him reasonable explanation of the behaviour of the hands on the front of the black box. In other words-it is the same as a Type I explanation. He can only test the complete adequacy of the model in terms of the predictions of the cogs and other parts. Another thing to notice is that this type of explanation involves inventing the existence of parts of the black box and their hypothetical relationshiups and it is because of the invention of these parts that totally new observations can be made. Let us call this type of explanatory hypothesis a Type 2 explanation. This is a convement point to indicate that there is a fourth type of statement found in science, consequences of explanatory hypothesis, i.e. statements about the hypothetical cogs. I do not want to discuss the merits of either type1 of explanation, but is it only fair to say that most scientific theories progress along the lines of Type 2 explanations. The behaviour of chemicals in a test tube is explained by the statements about molecules. These can be ex- plamed in terms of statements about atoms and valency and these can be explained m terms of statements about electrons and protons, so that one arnves, m a well developed science, at a theory with several layers of Type 2 explanatory hypotheses from which an original observation 1 A somewhat similar analysts of explanatory statements has been made by B. Ellis, 'A Comparison of Process and Non-process Theories m the Physical Sciences', this Journal, 1957, 8, 45-56. 283</page><page sequence="20">R. F. J. WITHERS record is derivable and from wluch new types of observation records can be made. 3 The Use of Models in Science 1 In the example I have just given we used the model of our own wrist watch for one reason. This was because we have a description of its behaviour ready to hand as a calculus. The calculus consists of statements which have been tested in the past and found satisfactory for our watches. The calculus itself will consist of statements expressing relationships between vanables and in order to derive consequences from it which can be tested those vanables must be replaced by subject matter signs. In other words the calculus must be given a semantical interpretation at least and only at least at the lower levels of the calculus. It must have a semantical interpretation at those levels where we wish to test it. However, when we use this calculus as a model the first problem that crops up is whether the semantical interpretation, appro- priate to the sciences of wrist watches, is suitable for the new situation. In the case of the black box being an electric clock it will soon turn out that the interpretation is falsified. Note that it is the interpretation which is incorrect--not the calculus--for that enables us to predict. We are then faced with the choice of looking for a new interpretation of the variables in the calculus or trying to think up a new calculus with its own interpretation. In any case, the important point is that the model was used in the first place because it had its own calculus, and it was a system of ready to hand statements that we were looking for. Provided we can invent a calculus we do not need to look for a model. In practice it is difficult to invent calculi, and the heuristic desirability of models for supplying calculi has unfortunately changed the emphasis from realising the im- portance of the calculus to believing the importance of the model. The calculus is the most important thing for the development of a theory, the model--or rather the semantical interpretation of a model- may actually be misleading as in the billiard ball model for fundamental particles. Now a danger in the development of a science is that a good science may have a well established senes of layers of explanatory hypotheses 1A more detailed account of the use of models m scence is to be found in E. H. Hutten, ' The Role of Models i Physics ', ThisJournal, I954, 4, 284-301, and M. B. Hesse, ' Models m Physics', this Journal, 1954, 4, 198-214. 284</page><page sequence="21">SCIENTIFIC THEORY CONSTRUCTION of Type 2. Because they are established they fit most fields and have been successful m the past. If a new field of observation records arises the generalisations of them may be arranged as the consequences of using as a model calculus an established theory which has been successful and is interpreted in another field. Provided that there are no counter- examples, progress proceeds by taking over the old theory as a model into a new field and looking for entities in the new field which behave like the parts at the various levels in the old field. In other words, we attempt a new interpretation of the calculus by looking for new subject matter signs to replace the variables in the model calculus. If counter-instances are produced or if predictions using the old theory do not quite fit the generalisations of observation records in the new theory an attempt can be made to modify the model. Generali- sations of accurate observation records in the new field may give rise to discrepancies when tested if the old theory is used to interpret or derive them. Further, when one has a satisfactory system thius can be sufficiently powerful for it to dictate the sort of generalisation that is made. If this is the case and counter-instances are still produced specific ad hoc hypotheses can be invented to cover the discrepancies from ex- perience. In the end the calculus becomes extremely cluttered up with these ad hoc hypotheses. Further, a situation may arise in which a scientist has attempted a Type 1 explanation which works with greater elegance and greater precision in prediction. In this case the problem becomes acute if the Type I explanation is not derivable from the older theory used as a model. The scientist is then faced with the problem of whether to use the Type 1 explanation, because of its efficiency, empirically, to abandon it, or whether to look round for another model which might help him to invent Type 2 explanation from which thlus particular Type 1 explanation is derivable. So far as I can see there is no reason in prminciple why this should not be attempted, other than the usefulness of the old model and the natural conservatism of scientists. If it were achieved it may involve the over-throw of a pre-existing theory. However, it is worthwhile remembering that it is only a model calculus that is being over-thrown and the process may possibly end up by being responsible for a more adequate theory. The new theory mcidentally should have as one of its consequences some of the successful statements of the old model. Tlus is the way in which real progress in science is achieved. 285</page><page sequence="22">R. F. J. WITHERS 4 Discussion of the Nutting Equation in Rheology Let us now examine the situation as seen in the Scott Blair and Burnett paper whiuch reflects the present position. The authors say in the discussion that they have found it convenient to describe their experi- ments m terms of models of dashpots and springs. It is worth noting that by description here they mean that they have explained their results in terms of a Type 2 explanation. However, they note that there are limitations m this particular explanatory hypothesis. For example, they ask how the principle of superposition is to be reconciled with the power equation relating dissipating stress to time? The principle of superposition was derivable from the spring and dashpot model, but the power equation was obtained from experiment. It is true that thus could have been derived from extending the spring-dashpot model to an infinite number of springs and dashpots related exponentially, but otherwise was not obtainable. The calculus would therefore become exceedingly cumbersome, and unless it was made cumbersome it would not lead to accurate predictions for relating dissipating stress with time. In an attempt to offer an explanation whiuch will cover the difficulties between linear superposition and the power equation for relating dis- sipating stress and time, the authors turn to their own solution. This is to derive the relationships from an extension of the Nutting Equation. Now this seems to me to be an attempt at a Type 1 explanation. It can be tested in terms of deriving consequences and seeing whether the fit of the data does not significantly differ from the results expected on the basis of the extended Nutting Formula. I take it that this has been done and there is no doubt that as a Type 1 explanation the Nutting formula is satisfactory. Moreover, it is more satisfactory because of its having fewer parameters than the equations derivable from even a spring-dashpot model. The problem then is not whether to accept tlus Type 1 explanation, but to relate it to current and future rheological theory. Graham points out in his paper that this is the point m discussing what he calls the difference between fundamental (already existing) and empirical (con- struction of Type I explanations) views. In relating it to present rheological theory one can proceed in two directions. (a) To look for a Type 2 explanation of their formula. (b) To look for consequences of their formula which predict an occurrence which would not occur under the spring-dashpot 286</page><page sequence="23">SCIENTIFIC THEORY CONSTRUCTION theory. A test of this consequence would be the deciding factor between the two theories. Can this be done? I take it that the major question in the minds of most critics of the use of the Nutting formula by Graham and Scott Blair is that at the moment there is no Type 2 explanation of it. It is a possibility that no satisfactory Type 2 explanation is forth- coming. In this case a search for examples of the application of the equation might be useful. Already it appears to me that a wide range of application has been shown. A similar situation can be seen in a new field of study-General System Theory--discussed by von Berta- lanffy,1 in which a study is made of those systems in which predictions can be made on the basis of isomorphic laws. A study of the character- istics of the complex systems which are covered by such isomorphic laws may give us a clue as to Type 2 explanations which might be useful in the various fields. In this way the relationship between power law in rheology and the power equations involved in the phenomena of relative growth in biology 2 might be related. One such model, ap- plicable to Scott Blair's material and biological phenomena of growth would be a model based on the kinetics of enzyme activity, for the biologist believes that the differences m relative growth m different organisms is related to genetic factors affecting rates of enzyme activity in different processes which affect growth. 5 Conclusion We must therefore return to the objections which have been mentioned in the beginning. (I) That it is inconceivable that all complex phenomena can have a simple explanation. My answer would be that there is no reason why even complex phenomena could not be described m terms of a simple generalisation, provided one can describe what one wants to describe without introducing all the com- plexities inherent in the material. This minimum type of de- scription is the basis of all generalisation. If we went to describe the weight of a lump of sugar, or its behaviour as a falling body, then we leave out its colour, its taste, its use etc., and yet can still make meaningful generalisations about it so far as it is to be 1 L. von Bertalanffy, ' An Outline of General System Theory ', ths Journal, 1951, I, 134-72 2J. H. Huxley, ' Problems of Relanve Growth', London, I932. 287</page><page sequence="24">R. J. F. WITHERS described as a falling body. The same sort of difficulty is found m description of human behaviour which is undoubtedly very complex, but advances are made when some of tlus complexity is shed. Then there is no reason why a Type 1 explanation which appeared simple should not be used to derive this simple generalisation. A Type 2 explanation will undoubtedly increase the complexity of the explanation, in so far as new concepts are involved in this. (2) That the phenomenological method that has been followed is mere curve-fitting I do not think in itself is a bad thing. If the curves enable more accurate predictions to be made and are more economical of parameters it represents an advance because the curve represents a Type 1 explanation. Unless it can be shown that a Type 2 explanation cannot, in principle, be sug- gested from which the Type 1 explanation follows, the formula for the curve should be accepted. (3) That merely to represent results by a formula does not meet the essential need of explanation. This objection rests on an under- standing of what is meant by the essential need of explanation. If by this we mean the need for a Type 2 explanation then we can attempt to think of the direction of the next step in theory construction which is to find such as the Type 2 explanation. (4) That progress can only be made by fundamental studies is quite definitely a false concept. There are two sorts of progress, (a) the search for generalisations and Type I explanations, and (b) the search for Type 2 explanations. Finding of better Type 1 explanations may require the revision of previously existing Type 2 explanations as in my clock example. (5) That a fundamental result must be based upon atomic factors. This is only true so far as one sort of progress is made by searching for Type 2 explanations. Finally, m case we feel that Type 1 explanations are unsatisfactory at low levels (low in the sense that they are close to observation records) at high levels we have to use Type 1 explanations until we can see a way of talking about still higher levels. A scientific theory is a calculus and we need not ask first whether the term in it refers to anything. The prime question is whether the formulae expressed at the higher levels are useful in prediction. Middlesex Hospital London, W.I 288</page></plain_text>
