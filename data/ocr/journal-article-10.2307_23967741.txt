Introduction WRITING in 1898 ('Alcune note di letteratura patristica', RendicontiRendiconti del Reale Istituto Lombardo di Scienze e Lettere ser. 2, 31 (1898) pp. 1033-6 = Opere Minori II (Studi e Testi 77 (1937))» PP· 558־), Giovanni Mercati discussed a fragment attrib uted to Anthimus, bishop of Nicomedia who was martyred in the Diocletianic persecution. Entitled On the holy Church, it was addressed to a certain Theodore. He had found it in Codex Ambrosianus Η 257 inf. of the thirteenth century, fol. 32r—33r (=A; see A. Martini &amp; D. Bassi (eds.), Catalogus Codicorum GraecorumGraecorum Bibliothecae Ambrosianae 2 (Milan: U. Hoepli, 1906) no. 1041 p. 1110: Mercati wrongly refers to 32v~33v), and noted the existence of another copy in the Escorial (in MS Y.I 1.7 also of the thirteenth century, fol. 102r-103v =S; see G. de Andres OSA. (ed.), Catdlogo de los Codices Griegos de la Real Biblioteca de de el Escorial 2 (Madrid, 1965) no. 262 p. 113) from a catalogue of Greek MSS there. In a follow-up article, 'Note di letteratura biblica e cristiana antica. VIII. Anthimi Nicomediensis episcopi et martyris de sancta Ecclesia', Studi e Testi 5 (1901) pp. 87-98 (=M), Mercati, with the help of a copy of S made by Eribert Plekkers of Beuron, reproduced the Greek text collated from the two MSS, the longer and mostly superior A and the abbreviated S. A, a collection of pieces of varying length and genre on ortho doxy and heresy from a range of fathers including Epiphanius {Mens.{Mens, et pond., Anakeph., and Haer.), Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril of Alexandria, Anastasius of Sinai, and John of Damascus, sandwiches the fragment between Timothy of Constantinople's De receptione haereticorum (MPG 86 12ff.) and an extract from a letter of Maximus the Confessor on her esiarchs. S is similar, a collection of decrees, letters and excerpts from an overlapping list of fathers. Thus it includes such as John Chrysostom, Basil, Epiphanius {Haer., from the Herodians and Simonians on but in a different order), Cyril, Theodoret, Leontius of Byzantium, and Maximus (the same passage on two © Oxford University Press 2000 [Journal of Theological Studies, NS, Vol. 51, Pt. 1, April 2000]</page><page sequence="2">82 ALASTAIR Η. Β. LOGAN natures (PG 91, 145-9) as A), sandwiching the fragment between a list of the fathers at Nicaea and the Maximus passage just mentioned (not spotted by de Andres). As Mercati notes (art. cit. p. 92), the version in S is considerably reduced, marred by mistakes and lacks the last paragraph. It is evidently not more original than A, even though it preserves some better read ings, including a list of heretics from Cerdo to the Manichees evidently omitted by A. As regards form and content, Mercati describes it as a letter or tract (p. 87). That it has an addressee in the title ('To Theodore') and is addressed to an individual in the text (8: tv' elbevai εχοις), might suggest the former rather than the latter. It is a defence of the one, Catholic and apostolic Church against heresies with their limited regional extension and derivation, not from the apos ties and their successors, the Catholic bishops, but from Hermes Trismegistus, Plato and Aristotle. After this general theme (1—3), there follows a catalogue of heretics arranged roughly chronolo gically, but, as we shall see, topically as well, from the Sadducees to the Manichees, to illustrate it (4-7). Then comes the crux of the piece: the demonstration that the Arians (including Eusebius of Caesarea as well as Asterius) derived some of their distinctive dogmas from Hermes and Plato via Valentinus, and others from Apelles, Marcion's disciple, and Dositheus, heresiarch of the Sadducees, with whom the catalogue began (8-18). The fragment concludes with a final claim that these heretics got their names from their particular heresiarchs and not from the holy, Catholic and apostolic Church, their original mother (19). If the work is a unity, the content at once appears to rule out any ascription to Anthimus. Mercati suspected section 8-18 of being an interpolation partly because of the abrupt jump from second to fourth century heretics (p. 90), and in this he was followed by Walter Scott, Hermetica 4: Testimonia (Oxford: Clarendon, 1936), p. 155 n. 2, who suggested a date of around 350. Several possible hypotheses present themselves. Either (a) as A. Harnack argued (Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur bis bis Eusebius 2. Die Chronologie 2 (Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1904), pp. 158-60), it is a complete fiction by a later writer attributed to Anthimus, or (b) as O. Bardenhewer suggested (Geschichte der der altchristlichen Literatur 2 2nd edn. (Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 1914), pp. 333-4), its kernel is a genuine letter on'the church to Theodore by Anthimus, who is said in the martyr acts of Domna and Inde (in Simeon Metaphrastes PG 116, 1073, cf. 1076A) to have written a letter full of consolation to his church community from his hiding place in a village. Bardenhewer</page><page sequence="3">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 83 suggests that a reader around the middle of the fourth century made additions to that kernel, which might have included the sec tion on the second century heretics. A third possibility was sug gested by Marcel Richard in 1949 in a seminal article ('Un opuscule meconnu de Marcel eveque d'Ancyre', Melanges de science science religieuse 5 (1949), pp. 5-28 = Opera Minora II 33 (Turnhout/Leuven: Brepols/University Press, 1977)), developed out of his examination of the fragments of Marcellus, that (c) it was a single genuine work by Marcellus (who would surely have written in his own name), later pseudepigraphically attributed to Anthimus. This is his preferred solution to the other possible alternative, involving two different texts, one by Anthimus, the other by Marcellus, combined more or less successfully by a disciple of Marcellus or by some accident of MS transcription. Harnack, who rejected Mercati's arguments for interpolations while allowing the fragment might be part of an authentic letter to Theodore, produced the following arguments against the genu ineness of the piece: (1) the citation of Eusebius of Caesarea and Asterius; (2) the naming of the Manichees and their derivation from Cerdo, Marcion, and Lucian; (3) the list climaxing with the Arians; (4) the dependence of the list on Epiphanius and even more on Filastrius, since the heretics Hermes and Seleucus are only attested in him; and (5) the statements about the Church, unheard of in the early fourth century on the part of an Easterner. Harnack concluded that the piece derived from the end of the fourth century at the earliest. Richard argued for the unity of the piece and its Marcellan provenance first by comparing the surviving genuine Marcellan material (for him the letter to Julius and the extracts from Eusebius of Caesarea collected and ordered by Klostermann in an appendix to his edition of Eusebius' Contra Marcellum and De De ecclesiastica theologia (Eusebius Werke 4, GCS 14 (Leipzig, 1906), pp. 184—215; rev. ed. G. C. Hansen (Akademie: Berlin, 1972)) with 8-18 of the fragment. He identifies the distinctive per spective of Marcellus over against other anti-Arians (ignoring subordination; rejecting any anthropomorphic understanding of the Word's generation before the ages as implying ditheism; attacking three hypostases), and argues that this is precisely that of Ps.-Anthimus. He also notes similar terminology, while admitting that section 18 on Arian blasphemies against the Holy Spirit suggests a much later date, the third quarter of the fourth century. Marcellus, of course, judging from Epiphanius' com ment (Haer. 72.1: Holl 3 255.8f. and footnote), seems to have died in 374.</page><page sequence="4">84 ALASTAIR Η. Β. LOGAN He then examines and 1—7 and 19, taking up Harnack's criti cisms (2), (4) and (5), upholding their authentic character over against Harnack's rejection and Bardenhewer's cautious defence, with the aid of his Marcellan thesis, arguing that Marcellus wrote the whole work which was later assigned to Anthimus as a pseud epigraph. Marcellus was surely most probably responsible for the passages on Valentinus and Apelles, and Harnack's arguments are neatly reversed: rather than Easterners borrowing from Filastrius, a reverse of the normal trend in theology at the time, the latter most likely got his information on Hermes and Seleucus—two Galatian heretics!—from Marcellus. He also demonstrates that the Arian section (16) does relate to the heresy list (4-7), while the Sadducean denial of the Holy Spirit (5) links very well with the Arians deriving their doctrine on the Spirit from Dositheus, heresiarch of the Sadducees (18). Richard's analysis and conclusions have been generally accepted, for example by Martin Tetz, 'Zur Theologie des Markell von Ankyra I: Eine Markellische Schrift "De incarna tione et contra Arianos'", ZKG 75 (1964), p. 221, and Manlio Simonetti, 'Su alcune opere attribuite di recente a Marcello d'Ancira', Rivista di storia e letteratura religiosa 9 (1973), pp. 313-6. Tetz refers in a footnote (n. 21) to the comment by G. Kretschmar, Studien zur fruhchristlichen Trinitatslehre (Tubingen: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1956), p. 19 n. 3, that prayer to the Holy Spirit was the chief difficulty in ascribing the fragment to Marcellus; Tetz could find no grounds for such a difficulty in Richard's thesis. However, in 1983 Richard Hanson argued ('The Date and Authorship of Pseudo-Anthimus De Sancta Ecclesia', Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 83, C, 9 (1983), pp. 251-4) that the particular type of Arianism targeted in the fragment by reference to Aristotle was Neo-Arianism (as further indicated by the appeal to the Word's origination by the will of God and the designation of the Spirit as 'servant'). This would suggest a date after 365 and thus the hypothesis of Marcellus himself as author seems 'unnecessary and fragile' (p. 253): the work derives from an author from the Eustathian and Marcellan tradition of theology in Antioch as late as the 370s and 380s (p. 254). In an article in 1989, 'Marcellus of Ancyra and anti-Arian Polemic', E. A. Livingstone (ed.), Studia Patristica 19 (Leuven: Peeters, 1989), pp. 189-97, I attempted to counter Hanson's case. He unfortunately had not been able to consult Richard's art icle, and deal with its detailed arguments for Marcellus himself as the most likely author, but both would agree on a late dating.</page><page sequence="5">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 85 I defended Marcellus as author on the grounds of (1) terminology (the use of distinctive terms and expressions found in Marcellus' fragments); (2) theology (the naming of Marcellus' key opponents, Asterius and Eusebius of Caesarea, characteristic of the 340s but not much later; denial of three hypostases, a posi tion not defended by Marcellus' followers in the 370s; reference to Aristotle and to the Word's origination from the will of God by early Arians; concern with the Holy Spirit as found in Marcellus and his opponents in the 340s); and (3) the heresiolo gical catalogue (characteristic of Marcellus as the most likely source of Filastrius' list and treatment). Marcellus' sources I pos ited as Hippolytus, Refutatio omnium haeresium and Syntagma, and Tertullian, Praescriptio, discovered by him during his sojourn in Rome. Most recently Klaus Seibt in his large scale work, Die Theologie desdes Markell von Ankyra (Arbeiten ziir Kirchengeschichte 59: Berlin/New York: De Gruyter, 1994), pp. 64-6, has amended Richard's depiction of Marcellus' theology in the light of his own researches (Richard fails to note Marcellus' distinction between an origin and a begetting of the Word and wrongly assumes Marcellus excludes any idea of begetting, as he also wrongly claims Marcellus never polemized against the Word's creatureliness and subordination, and wrongly concludes that Eusebius of Caesarea did not calumniate Marcellus and that the letter to Julius was a false expression of the latter's belief). He also adds two more arguments for genuineness (the negative, anti-heretical use of δόγμα and the reference to Hermes and Seleucus as Galatian heretics—but Richard had already made that point (p. 24)!), and counters Hanson's arguments. First he echoes my argument that the early Arians already taught a deriva tion of the Son from the Father's will, then counters Hanson's appeal to the Aristotle reference as only relevant to the Neo Arians, by pointing out that only the name is mentioned without any accompanying polemic. Finally he admits that only Hanson's third argument, about the Holy Spirit, has force. But in favour of a dating between 340 and 350 (which would be my own choice: see below) he argues (1) Eusebius of Caesarea is spoken of as recently deceased; (2) the topic of the Holy Spirit was already in Marcellus' horizon in Eusebius' second book (a point already made by me); and (3) the topic must have been pursued by the Eusebians in the documents to which Marcellus responded with the so-called Western confession of Sardica. Seibt's final point is that dating the fragment late with Richard and Hanson does not exclude Marcellus as author. Although Seibt's renumbering</page><page sequence="6">86 ALASTAIR Η. Β. LOGAN of the fragments in his edition is likely to replace Klostermann's version, for convenience I refer to the latter in the commentary while adding Seibt's numeration (= St) and the pagination (= V.) of Markus Vinzent, Markell von Ankyra: Die Fragmente, Der Brief Brief an Julius von Rom (Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae 39 (Leiden: Brill, 1997)), who accepts Seibt's numeration almost entirely. However, there remain one or two aspects of this rather clumsy and superficial work which might make one hesitate before definit ively ascribing it to Marcellus and not to an epigone, influenced by his style and ideas. There is first, and perhaps most signific antly, the tendency to speak of the Son pure and simple where one might have expected some qualifying reference to the Logos (cf. ι (M 95.4: 'One God, one Son of God and one Holy Spirit...'); 2 (95.16: from the prosopon of God the Father to the Son: Isa. 49:6); 9 (96.49: Valentinus as first to invent three hypo stases of Father, Son and Holy Spirit). Now in the fragments Marcellus insists on speaking only of the Logos when referring to the situation prior to the incarnation, the titles 'Son' and 'Jesus Christ' only becoming valid after that event (cf. e.g. frs 42 (St 7: V. 10) and 91 (St 5: V. 46)); when such titles occur in the Old Testament they are to be understood as prophetic. However when we consider the occurrences of 'Son' in our text, we find that they either fall within this rubric (cf. 2 (95.15-18)), or echo Scripture and the general credal formulae of the Church, as in the letter to Julius (cf. 1 (95.4), 9 (96.49), 10 (96.58, quoting John 1:18), and letter to Julius (V. 126.13, 128.4, 11))- What is more, both that letter and De sancta ecclesia combine the titles 'Son' and 'Logos' in an odd anarthrous way which seems characteristic of Marcellus at this period (cf. letter (V. 126.9) and De s. eccl. 17 (98.86)). The other problem is the howler of attributing passages of the TimaeusTimaeus to Plato's words to Gorgias. Marcellus, it should be noted, does cite the Gorgias in the fragments (cf. fr. 88 (St 22: V. 22.16-19) citing Gorg. 454DE). However the problem, if awk ward, is not entirely unanswerable. Marcellus' situation in the mid-340s, if my hypothesis is justified, was very different from that when writing his book against Asterius. Then he would have had access to the best libraries. In the mid-340s, dashing off a polemical letter perhaps from somewhere in exile, far from his books or a good library, he may have had access to a much more basic collection of philosophical sources, and/or just have been careless. His ability to quote from Hermetic tractates and works of Apelles need not be an objection—he must have made</page><page sequence="7">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 87 and kept personal copies of such texts, building up his own anthology. If then the case for Marcellan authorship holds up, there only remain the questions of the false ascription and the likely date. As regards the first, Richard is surely justified in rejecting the idea that Marcellus himself would have stooped to such a deception: he would have written in his own name. Further the pseudepigraph is too transparent and memories of the Great Persecution, par ticularly in Nicomedia, too fresh for contemporaries even in the 340s to have accepted Anthimus as author. However the obloquy that fell on Marcellus from 336 on must have made it increasingly difficult for anything written by him, particularly something crit ical of the Eusebians (cf. Sozomen, HE 2.33.1), to survive. Thus the most plausible hypothesis is that Marcellus wrote the letter in the 340s, probably from its tone and certain hints at the end, after his vindication by Julius and the Western Council of Sardica and in response to the breakaway Eastern Council. Then in the 370s a follower of his such as Eugenius (cf. the Eugenii LegatioLegatio et Confessio Fidei (PG 18, 1301— 5, edited by Martin Tetz, 'Markellianer und Athanasios von Alexandrien: Die markel lianische Expositio fidei ad Athanasium des Diakons Eugenios von Ankyra', ZNW 64 (1973), pp. 75-121), seeking to preserve it in the face of increasing criticism of Marcellus from Basil of Caesarea (cf. Ep. 69.2) and others, cast about for a suitable author and lit on Anthimus. Being the first episcopal victim of imperial persecution as occupant of the church of the then capital and later see of the 'Arian' leader, Eusebius of Nicomedia, he was a most appropriate candidate. Exact memories of events of 60-70 years before would have faded—certainly the pseudepigraph, however clumsy, did evade detection till modern times. The sub script: 'To Theodore on the holy Church' might be genuine, part of a dogmatic-type letter of Marcellus written after his sojourn in Rome in the heat of the debates between East and West of the mid-340s, and while his memories of his chief opponents, Eusebius of Caesarea and Asterius, were still fresh. Another pointer to a date in the mid-340s would be the concern with 'Arian' tenets such as three hypostases and the Son as a second God and Word, a product of the Father's will, which are reflected more in the documents of the Western and Eastern Councils of Sardica and the Eastern Ekthesis Macrostichos than in Marcellus' letter to Julius or Ps.-Athanasius, Oratio 4 contra Arianos (if to be dated to 340 with Vinzent, Pseudo-Athanasius, Contra Arianos Arianos IV: eine Schrift gegen Asterius von Kappadokien, Eusebius von Casarea, Markell von Ankyra &amp; Photin von Sirmium</page><page sequence="8">ALASTAIR Η. Β. LOGAN (Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae 36: Leiden: Brill, 1996)). In the letter to Julius the views attributed to Marcellus' opponents (the Son as not true Word etc., and as a distinct hypostasis; the Father pre-existing the Son, who is not true Son but like all things from God; 'there was when the Son was not', and thus he is a creature and work), are, as Vinzent has so persuasively argued ('Die Gegner im Schreiben Markells von Ankyra an Julius von Rom', ZKG 105 (1994), pp. 285-328), predominantly those of Asterius, as reconstructed from the fragments of Marcellus' book and from Athanasius, but as such they reflect earlier, slightly differ ent concerns. Possible echoes in Cyril of Jerusalem (see comment ary) may be a further pointer to a date in the mid-340s. As regards Marcellus' heresiological sources, I would like to make a slight modification to my 1989 article. I am now of the opinion that Marcellus' primary source was the Syntagma of Hippolytus (which can be reconstructed from Ps.-Tertullian, AdversusAdversus omnes haereses, Filastrius' Diversarum haereseon liber and Epiphanius' Panarion, as well as from the fragment itself), rather than the Refutatio omnium haeresium, which I then also attributed to Hippolytus. I am entirely convinced by the argu ments of Allen Brent, Hippolytus &amp; the Roman Church in the Third Third Century: Communities in Tension before the Emergence of a Monarch-Bishop Monarch-Bishop (Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae 31: Leiden: Brill, 1994), that only the Syntagma is the work of Hippolytus and that the Refutatio is to be attributed to an earlier author of the school of Hippolytus (henceforth referred to as Ps.-Hipp.). However elements of the latter's work, particularly the argument tracing heresy back to Greek philosophy, which although deriving from Irenaeus (who may have got it from Justin), was developed in relentless detail by the author of the Refutatio,Refutatio, may have influenced Marcellus. The work does not perhaps add much to our knowledge of Marcellus' theology and suffers from the typical weaknesses of polemical heresiology (superficiality, inaccuracy, use of tenden tious heresiological judgements and catalogues). As a polemical squib it is evidently of a much lower order of sophistication than Marcellus' treatise against Asterius, but that does not necessarily rule out his being the author. It contains terms and ideas charac teristic of Marcellus and does fit the context and period suggested rather well. If indeed genuine, it fills a gap in our knowledge of Marcellus' career and of the development of his thinking, and in any case forms a vital link in the heresiological chain from Irenaeus through to Epiphanius and Filastrius, particularly in the way it connects with and further influences Western treatments.</page><page sequence="9">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 89 It also represents one of the earliest signs of knowledge of Hermetic literature by Eastern Christians, and perhaps hints at the existence of further and alternative anthologies of texts from pagan literature to those of Eusebius and Lactantius, produced independently of them but possibly in part to counter their appeal to pagan support for their understanding of central Christian doctrines. Thus because of this and striking similarities in terminology, it may serve to strengthen the recent claim by Christoph Riedweg, Ps.-Justin (Markell von Ankyra?) Ad GraecosGraecos de vera religione (bisher 'Cohortatio ad Graecos'): Eine EinleitungEinleitung und Kommentar 2 vols (Schweizerische Beitrage zur Altertumswissenschaft 25: Basel: Reinhardt, 1994), that Marcellus was the author of Ps.-Justin, Cohortatio ad Graecos, with its extensive citation from florilegia and original sources to illustrate pagan error about the one God, derived from unassisted reason, and pagan truth about that God, derived from Moses and other prophetic sources of divine revelation. Finally it confirms the way key Eastern theologians like Athanasius and Marcellus built up and maintained a stereotyped and ultimately misleading and false picture of 'Arianism' as a heresy, through an obsessive dwelling on older figures like Eusebius of Caesarea and Asterius and their increasingly obsolete theological positions. This tendency is graphically illustrated by the last work which links both, the confession of orthodox faith to Athanasius by the Ancyran deacon, Eugenius, and his fellow clergy, defending their and Marcellus' orthodoxy. Tetz has convincingly demonstrated ('Markellianer') the way the confes sion's approach and theology is governed by the Tomus ad AntiochenosAntiochenos of Athanasius; thus it begins by anathematizing the Arian heresy and insisting on the creed of Nicaea, and proceeds to echo the rejection of the Spirit's creaturely status. But it thereby reinforces Athanasius' and Marcellus' stereotyped treat ment of 'Arianism'. II.II.

Just as there is one God and one Son of God and one Holy Spirit, so one human being was created by God and one cosmos, and so too there exists one Catholic and apostolic Church and one baptism throughout the whole cosmos, as Paul says: 'one God, one faith, one baptism' (Eph. 4:5). 2. There is then one Catholic and apostolic Church throughout the whole world, which received the faith from the apostles and preserves it up till now. Now it is called 'catholic' because it is spread throughout the entire cosmos, as the saying goes: 'their voice went out into all the earth and their (S his) words to the ends of the world' (Ps. 18:5), and 'That in every place incense | S 102v is offered and a pure sacrifice to God, and from the rising of the sun to its setting the name of the Lord is glorified among the nations' (Mai. 1:11). And again the prophecy as from the charac ter of God the Father to the Son: 'Behold' he says, '1 have set you as a light for the nations for you to be salvation to the end of the earth' (Isa. 49:6). 3. Now the heresies did not receive [their starting points, cf. 4] from the apostles or from their disciples or from the bishops their successors (since they would not have been called 'heresies', seeing that heresies have been so called from selecting something characteristic and following it). Nor again do they exist every where, but they are limited to very restricted areas where the devil prevailed in leading some astray through a vain lust for power, I Μ 96 [and] to establish them in command of his own evil scheming. This is the reason why their churches are not even called 'catholic'. 4. Therefore it is necessary to state from where and from whom the heretics received their starting points, [and] how they were brought down by heretics to the pit of ruin. For it is the custom among heretics to steal from one another and to discover new ideas as well—they boast that they are teachers of one another. 5. Now first of all by God's assent Sadducees deriving from the Jews proclaimed there was no resurrection, nor did they believe in a holy spirit nor in angels nor prophets. Cerinthus, after making slight alterations to their system, transmits it to the Ebionites. 6. Again those of Simon's school, called 'gnostics', Menander and Saturninus, Basilides, Marcus and Colorbasus and the rest, invented newer ideas than each other and passed them on to those taken in by them. This is why they also called themselves 'gnos tics'. The Ophites and Cainites, Sethites and the followers of Hermes and Seleucus were recipients from them, and so was the rest of the mob of heretics, who babble out such stuff—for exam pie I A 32v Carpocrates and Prodicus and Epiphanes (who also</page><page sequence="15">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 95 devised new ideas of their own) from Nicolaus, or Marcion and Lucian from Cerdo. From these Manichees took their starting points and transmitted new ideas. 7. Now all these derived the starting points of their impiety from the philosophers Hermes, Plato and Aristotle. 8. Now with the heresy of the Ariomaniacs, which has corrupted the Church of God, it is necessary to clarify the matter in their case as well, that you may be able to know that by deceit ful sophistry they have filched the dogmas of the ancients. 9. These then teach three hypostases, just as Valentinus the heresiarch first invented in the book entitled by him 'On the Three Natures'. For he was the first to invent three hypostases and three persons of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and he is discovered to have filched this from Hermes and Plato. 10. That is also why they again | Μ 97 devise a second god created by the Father before the ages, as their esteemed Asterius said, instructed by Hermes surnamed | S 103r Trismegistus (for this is how he speaks to Asclepius the physician: 'Hear then, Asclepius. The lord and maker of everything, whom we are accus tomed to name God, created the second god visible and percept ible as well'). This is also where he acquired his 'only begotten god' instead of from the divine John saying 'only begotten Son' (John 1:18; 3:16, 18). 11. 11. Then again Trismegistus says: 'When therefore he fash ioned this first and sole and one being, it appeared beautiful to him and filled with all goods, he was delighted and loved it with all his heart as his own offspring.' 12. This then was the source from which their notion of a first and second god originated. It was on account of this too that Eusebius of Caesarea wrote 'unbegotten'. 13. For Plato speaks as follows to Gorgias: 'Such then being the necessary nature of all these things, the demiurge of the most beautiful and the best took them over from among things gener ated at the time when he also begets his self-sufficient and most perfect son (Tim. 68E).' And again he says in the same work: 'This being so, we must agree that the one really exists with a form after them (?), unbegotten and imperishable, neither receiv ing anything from elsewhere into itself nor transforming itself into other entities, not even perceptible to sight or to any other sense, of which only the person who thinks has received contemplation. But there is a second with the same name, like it, but begotten, perceptible, in motion (Tim. 52A).' 14. I Μ 98 These have been the causes of error for those who fell away from the orthodox faith by not pursuing it intently.</page><page sequence="16">96 ALASTAIR Η. Β. LOGAN And what too was the source of their declaring that it was by the will of God that the Word of God subsisted? Did they not learn this too from Trismegistus? 15. For after the first god, when discussing the second, he speaks as follows: 'We shall see the preconceived god, who is like the one who was willed in every respect, but for two things: being in the body and being visible.' 16. In paying attention to these they were deprived of the true knowledge, boasting of being disciples of Hermes and Plato and Aristotle rather than of Christ and his apostles. 17. Now the second cause, Son, Word, which they are also accustomed to call second principle, they took | A 33r from Apelles, Marcion's pupil, who in a dispute with his own teacher spoke as follows: 'Marcion is wrong to speak of two principles: now I speak of one, which made a second principle.' 18. Furthermore, they blaspheme the Holy Spirit asserting that one should not venerate or revere it, for they disparage it as a slave and servant. | S 103v Deriving this impious dogma from Dositheus, heresiarch of the Sadducees, they have been suffocated in the pit of atheism. 19. One should also be aware of this, that at the same time as certain people withdrew, who were in revolt against the Church and the apostolic preaching, at that very moment those of their party who had been led astray also harvested the name of the schismatic heresiarch and lost the name of her who had nurtured them, the holy Catholic and apostolic Church. IV. Commentary Superscription·.Superscription·, this is in the name of Anthimus, bishop of Nicomedia and martyr, from a work to Theodore, on the holy Church. Anthimus died by beheading, perhaps as one of the first martyrs of the Great Persecution under Diocletian (cf. Eusebius, HE 8.6.6 and 13.1-2). The dating of this is problem atic. The Chronicon Paschale dates it to 303 in a passage Bidez has argued (Bidez-Winkelmann, GCS Philostorgius (Berlin: Akademie, 1972), CLIff.) comes from an Arian historian. However the passage includes a letter from the presbyter Lucian of Antioch from prison in Nicomedia, recounting Anthimus' recent martyrdom, which, since we can date Lucian's martyrdom to 7 January 312, would appear to suggest a date in 311.311. This seems confirmed by a fragment from the life and mar tyrdom of Lucian (in Bidez-Winkelmann, 188.19-189.3), which refers to Maximin casting Anthimus into the fire as well as</page><page sequence="17">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 97 Peter of Alexandria, who was martyred on 25 November 311. Certainly the Eastern Church celebrates Anthimus' martyrdom on 3 September. On the other hand, the evidence of Eusebius clearly points to decapitation, as does the passage from the Arian historian in the Chronicon Paschale (cf. Bidez-Winkelmann 203.203.17f.), which, however, is probably based on Eusebius, and an early Syrian Martyrology using a Greek source of the 360s gives the date as 24 April 303 (see F. Nau, 'Un martyrologe et douze menologes syriaques', Patrologia Orientalis 10, p. 15). To To Theodore: as Harnack points out, Geschichte, 160, the name is so common as to be of no help in identification. On On the holy Church: this could be a genuine description of the fragment, part of a letter, rather than a book (as Scott assumes, HermeticaHermetica 4, p. 155 n. 2), by Marcellus himself. On the term 'holy Church' cf. his letter to Julius (Kl./H. fr. 129 215.24: V. 128.9). Section Section 1 (1-3): Introduction to the theme: the one holy Catholic Church over against localized heresies. 1. Just as there is one God: in characteristic fashion Marcellus stresses the oneness of God as of Adam, the cosmos, the Catholic and apostolic Church and baptism, citing Eph. 4:5, but reading θΐός rather than κύριος. This may be to make clear that the Father is meant rather than the Son. Cf. fr. 75 (Kl./H. 200.15-22: St 90: V. 78.5-13) which does read and interpret κύριος κύριος in terms of the Son, and continues with the mention of θΐόςθΐός to indicate that the Father is included. The refrain, One God, one Son of God, one Holy Spirit', recalls the creed of Nicaea, as does the reference to the Catholic and apostolic Church. Cf. Irenaeus, Adv. haer. ι.ιο.ι/Epiphanius, Haer. 31.30.3-5, and also Marcellus' creed in the letter to Julius (Kl./ H. 215.3, 24: V. 126.7). The references to 'Son' here (and in 2 and 9) rather than to 'Logos', the preferred term of the fragments, or even the compromise 'Son/Logos' of the letter to Julius (Kl./H. 215.5, cf. 26: V. 126.9, cf- 128.12) might suggest Marcellus' more cautious and nuanced answer to earlier criticism. We find an echo of Eph. 4:5 and this theme of faith in one God and a preference for the term 'Son' in what may have been Marcellus' last work, the confession of faith sent in 371 to Athanasius by Eugenius, a deacon of Ancyra and other clergy and laity still loyal to him. 3.3 speaks of 'one faith in the one God through the Son and in the Holy Spirit' (Tetz, 'Markellianer' p. 81. Cf. the similar lan guage about the Catholic faith in one God, in the Son and the Holy Spirit coupled with insistence on one hypostasis in the likely Marcellan Epistula ad Liberium (Tetz, 'Zur Theologie des Markell von Ankyra III. Die pseudoathanasianische Epistula ad</page><page sequence="18">98 ALASTAIR Η. Β. LOGAN Liberium, ein Markellische Bekenntnis', ZKG 83 (1972), p. 152). Interestingly, Marcellus appears to be the first to introduce or attest the later credal formula 'one baptism', presumably under the influence of the Ephesians text. His creed in the letter to Julius (Kl./H. 215.24: V. 128.10) has 'forgiveness of sins', while the credal statement of the Eastern Council of Sardica (Hilary, frag.frag. hist. Coll. Antiar. Par. Series A IV.2 (29.3): Feder CSEL 65 (Vienna/Leipzig: Tempsky/Freytag, 1916), 72.2b) has 'holy Church, remission of sins'. Cf. Cyril of Jerusalem, Cat. 18.22 (one baptism for the forgiveness of sins followed by reference to the one holy Catholic Church); Procat. 7 (appealing to Eph. 4:5 to support the unrepeatability of baptism); Epiphanius, Anc. 118.12f. (one holy Catholic and apostolic Church... one baptism for the remission of sins). 2. One catholic and apostolic Church: his journey to and sojourn in Rome would have given Marcellus concrete evidence of the worldwide extent and universal character of the Church. throughout throughout the entire world: instead of κόσμος as in 1, Marcellus uses οίκουμενη to refer to the inhabited world, in an unmistak able allusion to Iren.

Now Now it is called 'catholic': as Mercati noted (p. 90 n. 2, p. 95 1. 10 app.), this definition occurs in the Pseudo-Athanasian QuaestionesQuaestiones in Novum Testamentum 37 (PG 28, 724A: Αιά τί η εκκλησία εκκλησία καλείται εκκλησία, και δια τί καθολική', Άπόκ. 'Εκκλησία μεν μεν δια τό πάντας επικαλεΐσθαι, καθολική δε διότι καθολοΰ του κόσμου κεχυμέκεχυμέκεχυμένη υπάρχει) attributed there to Cyril. That the Cyril in ques tion is he of Jerusalem, not of Alexandria, is evident from the similarity of expression in Cat. 18.23b: καθολική μεν ουν καλείται δια δια τό κατά πάσης της οικουμένης. The similarity might be a further pointer to a date in the early to mid-340s for the work. 'their'their voice...': A abbreviates this citation of Ps. 18:5 LXX, while S has the masculine singular ('his voice'; 'his words'), despite the feminine subject, rather than the plurals of LXX.</page><page sequence="19">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 99 'That'That in every placeboth versions reverse the order of this citation from Mai. 1:11 LXX, probably because the references to every place and incense etc. were more apropos, read προσφέρεται προσφέρεται (with e.g. Justin, Dial. 28.5; 41.2; 116.4; Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 5.136.2) rather than the προσάγεται of LXX, and understandably omit 'to my name' and change 'my name' to 'the name of the Lord'. For a citation of the latter part cf. Cyr. Jer. Cat. 18.25. as from as from the character: cf. Marc. Cohort. 34.1 (Marcovich p. 71); εκ εκ προσώπου του θεού seems to be echoed in fr. 58 (Kl./H. 195.10: St 98: V. 88.12). The same quotation formula with a vari ety of subjects, none of them exactly as here, is a striking feature of the pseudo-Athanasian De incarnatione et contra Arianos (PG 28, 984-1027), which Tetz details as part of his case for Marcellan authorship of the work (see 'Theologie I' p. 251). But Tetz is cautious about fragment 58 as representing an actual quo tation formula (p. 254), and Simonetti rejects Tetz's case ('Alcune opere' pp. 323-9), including this argument, noting how universal such a usage was, as does Hanson, 'Date', p. 252, where he refers to the ancient and widespread use of the formula from Justin (wrongly dated to the mid-third century!) on. Cf. Justin, 1 Apol.Apol. 36.1-2; 37.1; 38.1; 47.1; 49.1 and 53.7; Eus. Praep. ev. 7.11.5, 12.6; 11.9.1; Athanasius, C. gent. 34; De inc. 3; Cyr. Jer. Procat.Procat. 6; Cat. 16.29; Epiph. Haer. 23.6.4; 69.51.1 etc. (However it should be pointed out that Justin always uses από, not the εκ of Eusebius, Marcellus, Athanasius etc.) Prosopon does not necessarily imply a separate hypostasis, cf. Tetz, 'Theologie I' p. 254. That three prosopa are added to the three hypostases of Valentinus, the alleged source of the separate hypo stases of the Arians, in 9, might imply a careful distinction on Marcellus' part: while rejecting three hypostases he can accept three distinct (but not separate) prosopa in God. Cf. fr. 67 (Kl./ H. 198.7f.: St 48: V. 44.3) where Marcellus rejects Asterius' 'two separate (διαιρούμενα) prosopa'. 'Behold'Behold I have set you': Isa. 49:6 LXX. Cf. Iren.

Sadducees deriving from the Jews ...no resurrec tion:tion: cf. Ps.-Clem. Rec. 1.54.2f. Marcellus appears to be using Hippolytus' Syntagma as his main source for the catalogue. From Photius, Bibliotheca 121 (PG 103, 401D-403B), and from a comparison of Ps.-Tert. Adv. omn. haer. 1.1 (CCSL 2 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1954), p. 1401) and Filastrius, Div. haer. lib. 4f. (Marx CSEL 38 (Prague/Vienna/Leipzig: Tempsky/Freytag, 1898) p. 3), we gather that Hippolytus began with Jewish heretics, Dositheus as heresiarch of the Samaritans, who denied the resur rection, the Holy Spirit, angels and prophets, followed by the Sadducees. This is corroborated by 18 where Arian denial of the Holy Spirit is derived from the views of Dositheus, heresiarch of the Sadducees. Filastrius appears to have been more influenced by Marcellus here than by Epiphanius, his usual main source (cf. Epiph. Haer. 13.1.1 where Dositheans accept the resurrec tion, and 14.2.2 where the Sadducees are described as here but Filastrius does not follow suit). nor nor ...in a holy spirit, nor in angels nor prophets: cf. Epiph. Haer. 14.2.2. Gregory of Nazianzus' allusion to Sadducean denial of the Holy Spirit, angels and the resurrection (Or. 31.5), appears more dependent on Marcellus' version than on that in Epiphanius (ibid.). The passage does not seem to betray real knowledge of the Sadducees, but evidently derives from their description as ori ginating from the Samaritans, who, as only accepting the Pentateuch, were considered not to believe in the prophets (and by extension the angels and Holy Spirit announcing and instigat ing the incarnation). Cerinthus,Cerinthus, after making slight alterations: here Marcellus plainly departs from the Hippolytan catalogue, which, following</page><page sequence="21">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 101 Irenaeus, seems to have placed Cerinthus after Carpocrates (cf. Iren. 1.26.1; Ps.-Tert. 3.2; Fil. 36). As will become clear, Marcellus has reorganized Hippolytus' list topically; he starts with Jewish heresies, Dositheans to Ebionites (1-4), then come the dualist 'gnostics', Simon to Hermes and Seleucus (5-14), then libertine 'gnostics' from them, Nicolaus to Epiphanes (15-18), and finally the strict dualists, Cerdo to the Manichees (19—22). The Jewish colour of Cerinthus in Hippolytus' work is suggested by the way he is treated by Epiphanius (Haer. 27) and Filastrius (36). Athanasius' unparalleled derivation of Arian views of Christ from the Sadducees (De deer. 10.4), has probably been influenced by Marcellus and his catalogue, which derives the Ebionites and their views from Cerinthus and the Sadducees. This would be further evidence to support a date for De sancta ecclesiaecclesia in the 340s rather than in the 360s or later, and to indicate the influence of Marcellus on Athanasius' attitude to Arianism. Cf. Cyril of Jerusalem's genealogy of heresy starting with Simon and ending with the Manichees in Cat. 6.14-20. 6. those of Simon's school, called 'gnostics'■, the lumping together of heretics from Menander to the Valentinians as 'gnostics' deriv ing from Simon is the gist of Irenaeus' charge (cf. 1.23.3/Epiph. 21.4.4; 2 praef.), probably picked up by Hippolytus, and from him by Marcellus and Epiphanius (cf. Epiph. 31.1.5). Following Hippolytus' catalogue, Marcellus mentions the first few names after Simon then jumps to the last of the Valentinian group. Marcus and Colorbasus are linked exactly as here by Ps.-Hipp. Ref.Ref. 6.55.1—3, who speaks of those of the Valentinian school inventing novelties (καινότερα 17τιγνώντες). What would seem to unite this group as 'gnostics' is a particular dualism involving belief in an unknown transcendent God who is not responsible for this world, which is the work of angels (or a lower demiurge) deriving from but hostile to him, and a consequent anti-cosmic view of salvation involving the soul alone through knowledge brought by a docetic Saviour. those those taken in by them: cf. Epiph. 21.6.3. The The The Ophites, Cainites and Sethites: ...recipients from them: for the claim cf. Epiph. 23.2.1. The first two are derived from the 'gnostics' of Iren. 1.30-31, probably given their present identities by Hippolytus (cf. Ps.-Tert. 2; Epiph. 37.1.if.; 38.1.1). The third is Hippolytus' addition from his own knowledge of gnostics who had reinterpreted their myth in terms of Seth (cf. Ps.-Tert. 2; Origen, CommTit frag, in Pamphilus, Apology 1 (PG 17, 554A: 'Tethianos'); Epiph. 39.1.1-5.3 and my book, Gnostic Truth and Christian Heresy (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1996),</page><page sequence="22">102 ALASTAIR Η. Β. LOGAN ch. 2). Their myth is not the same as that of the Sethians of the Refutatio,Refutatio, although there may be some relation. Since Filastrius transferred the three to the beginning as most ancient, presumably because of their concern with Adam, Cain, and Seth, he has felt obliged to add a heresy of Jude (34) derived from Irenaeus' account of the Cainites (1.31.1), after Nicolaus. and and the followers of Hermes and Seleucus: these obscure Galatian heretics, as noted above, are only otherwise attested by Filastrius (55 and 56), and are a key factor in Richard's argument for Marcellan authorship. Their confused views do have some resemb lance to the 'gnostics' of Fiippolytus and Marcellus in that they teach the angelic creation of the soul, and are claimed to have undergone Platonic influence (see commentary on 7 and below). CarpocratesCarpocrates and Prodicus and Epiphanes ...from Nicolaus: again Marcellus departs from the likely order in Hippolytus, which according to Ps.-Tert. 1, Epiph. 25 and Fil. 33, had Nicolaus and the gnostics after Basilides. Fiippolytus' account is clearly independent of Iren. 1.26.3 and attested by Theodoret, Haer. 3.x, who records that Hippolytus, bishop and martyr, wrote against the Nicolaitans. Marcellus distinguishes this sub-group of 'gnostics' as libertines. While S reads Carpocrates, as in Iren. 1.25.1f./Ps.-Hipp. 7.32 and Ps.-Tert. 3.1, A has the form Carpocras, which is echoed in Epiph. 27.1.1 and Fil. 35. Prodicus is otherwise only attested in Tert. Prax. 3.6; Scorp. 15.6; Clem. Alex. Strom. 1.15.69.6; 3.4.30.1; 7.7.41.1, and Theod. 1.6. Tertullian links Prodicus with Valentinus, but Clement is the likely source of Marcellus' information, noting {Strom.{Strom. 3.4.30.1) that Prodicus' adherents falsely style themselves 'gnostics'. Epiphanes (S has the mistaken form Epiphanius) is attested by Clem. Alex. Strom. 3.2.5.2 as son of Carpocrates, influenced by Plato and founder of the monadic and antinomian gnosis of the Carpocratians. Theod. 1.5, links father and son and follows their heresy with that of Prodicus (1.6), referring to Clem. Strom. 3. That Epiphanius, 25.2.1, includes Epiphanes' sect among the libertine followers of Nicolaus, betraying no knowledge of his relation to Carpocrates, might suggest he is dependent on the same source as Marcellus. In 25.7.2 he derives the 'gnostics' from Nicolaus and Simon Magus. new new ideas: Cf. Epiph. 25.2.1. S has misread Kaivorepa to produce the unknown heretic Notarius, while the homoeoteleuton has caused A to omit the following group of heretics, Cerdo to the Manichees. MarcionMarcion and Lucian from Cerdo: again Marcellus has departed from Hippolytus' order. Having moved Cerinthus and Ebion to</page><page sequence="23">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 103 the Jewish heretics at the start, he now omits the Valentinians, who will feature later, and mentions Hippolytus' next group, united by the fact that they begin with the concept of two original principles or gods, one good, the other evil or imperfect. On Cerdo cf. Iren. 1.27.1; Ps.-Tert. 3; Ps.-Hipp. 7.37.1; Eus. HE 4.11;4.11; Epiph. 41; Fil. 44. On Marcion cf. Iren. 1.27.2f.; Ps.-Tert. 3; Ps.-Hipp. 7.37; Epiph. 42; Fil. 45. On Lucian (Lucan in Ps. Tert. 4 and Fil. 46) cf. Epiph. 43. From From these Manichees: this is Marcellus' own contribution, deduced no doubt from the two-principle teaching attributed to Cerdo and Marcion. Cf. Eus. HE 7.31.1—2; Epiph. 66; Fil. 61; Theod. 1.26 (note his echo of Marcellus' order: Cerdo and Marcion, Apelles, Mani). On Marcion and Mani cf. Cyr. Jer. Cat.Cat. 18.26; Ath. Ep. ad ep. Eg. Lib. 4. On the Manichees as in effect teaching two gods cf. Ath. Or. c. Ar. 2.40-41. On their being associated with Marcionites, Valentinians, Basilidians, and Simon cf. Ath. Or. c. Ar. 1.3. 7. All these took the starting points of their impiety from the philosophers philosophers Hermes, Plato and Aristotle: cf. fr. 85 (Kl./H. 203. 22-24: St 118: V. 110.8-11) where he describes Eusebius of Caesarea as speaking like Valentinus and Hermes, and Narcissus of Neronias like Marcion and Plato. This theme apparently first occurs in Iren. 2.14.if., is echoed in Tert. Praesc. 7.3-8, and developed into a massive thesis by the author of the Refutatio (cf. 1.26.4; 5.2). Cf. also Theod. 1.7. The mention of Aristotle need not suggest a date in the 360s since (a) he is not exploited as a heretical source, (b) one of Marcellus' sources, Ps. Hippolytus, derives Basilides' ideas from Aristotle (Ref. 7.14, 19.9, 24.iff. etc.), and (c) the author of the Cohortatio, in all like lihood Marcellus, writing, according to Riedweg in the 320s or 330s (Ps.-jfustin, 52), refers to Aristotle's ideas (cf. 5-6, 12). However, Hermes is Marcellus' own contribution, caused no doubt by his having become aware of Hermetic treatises (or excerpts in an anthology) which seemed to be sources of Arian ideas (see below). The allusion to Hermes in his book against Asterius might suggest he already had some awareness by 335. Now there seems to be no evidence of knowledge of the Hermetic corpus, or at least no certain citation of it by Eastern Christian writers, prior to Lactantius' bringing his Divinae insti tutionestutiones (with their Greek excerpts, cf. 1.6.2-5; 2.11.4f., 15.6-8; 4.6.3-9, 7.3, 25.10f.; 7.13.3, 18.4 etc.), probably composed in Africa around 308-9, to Nicomedia on his return (see Scott, HermeticaHermetica 1 77f., 94f.; T. D. Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius (Cambridge, MA/London: Harvard University Press, 1981),</page><page sequence="24">104 ALASTAIR Η. Β. LOGAN pp. 13f.). Lactantius must have brought a collection of Hermetic texts in Greek with him to Nicomedia. Marcellus may have come across them there, or more likely may have discovered a similar collection independently, perhaps in Egypt, in his search for the roots of Arianism. The author of the Cohortatio claims to have visited Egypt and quotes from a Hermetic treatise on the difficulty of grasping God (38.2: Marcovich, p. 78). He gives the fuller form, as does Lactantius (Epit. 4.5—but in Latin!), rather than the shorter form found in Stobaeus' first frag ment (2.1.26). On the dissemination of Hermetism, particularly in the East, see G. Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach Approach to the Late Pagan Mind (Cambridge: University Press, 1986), chs 7 and 8. Section Section j (8-18) The culmination. The Arians as also inspired by Hermes and Plato etc. 8. Ariomaniacs: it is not clear who first coined this nickname. Eustathius of Antioch uses it in a letter (cf. Theod. HE 1.8.3) which Hanson ('The Fate of Eustathius of Antioch' ZKG 95 (1984), pp. 171-9 esp. pp. 173f.) plausibly dates before 328-9. Constantine talks in a letter to Arius and the Arians of around 333 (Ath. De deer. 40.18) of την 'Αρείου μανίαν, and the term itself then occurs in the letter of presbyters and deacons of Alexandria to the Council of Tyre of August 335 (Ath. Apol. sec.sec. 75.if.). Cf. the letter of Egyptian bishops and others to the same Council (77.5). It then appears in Syriac in Athanasius' Festal Letters 10 and 11 of 338 and 339 (see A. Mai, Novae PatrumPatrum Bibliothecae 6 (Rome, 1853) pp. 93 and 107), which A. Camplani (Le lettere Festali di Atanasio di Alessandria (Rome: CIM, 1989), pp. 246f.) notes as the first explicit mention by name of the Arians in the works of Athanasius, correcting the false Syriac word division and dependent Latin translation ('Arius('Arius et Manes') of the term by Cureton and Mai. Then it appears in the letter of the Alexandrian synod of 340 (Ath. Apol.Apol. sec. 6-8), in Julius of Rome's letter to the Eusebians of 341 (Ath. Apol. sec. 23.3) and in the letter of the Western Council of Sardica of 343 (Ath. Apol. sec. 42.2/Theod. HE 2.8.2). Athanasius may have added it in some cases and certainly, apart from Eustathius' usage, this is one of the first occurrences independent of Athanasius' evidence (its presence in the non Athanasian Or. c. Ar. 4.8, where the Eusebians are so designated, may be dated to around 340, if the case developed by Vinzent, Pseudo-Athanasius,Pseudo-Athanasius,Pseudo-Athanasius, is accepted). If Eustathius did coin it, certainly Athanasius publicized it widely. Marcellus probably adopted it from him, in their time together in the West, rather</page><page sequence="25">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 105 than from Eustathius, since there is no trace of it, direct or indir ect, in the fragments of his treatise against Asterius of 335. But unlike Athanasius, who can carefully distinguish the Eusebians from the Ariomaniacs (cf. Ep. encyc. 2; 7), Marcellus seems to lump Eusebius of Caesarea and Asterius together under that title (cf. 10 &amp; 12), as does the author of Or. c. Ar. 4 (cf. Vinzent, op. cit. p. 212). The term remained a favourite of Athanasius and was taken over by Western anti-Arians (cf. Eusebius of Vercellae, Ep. 2.3 (PL 12, 949D); Hilary of Poitiers, De Trin. 7.7 etc.). That the Arians are the real target as the climax of the heresiological catalogue demonstrates the unity of the work against the suspicions of Mercati and others. deceitful deceitful sophistry: the term 'έντεχνος occurs in frs. 55 (Kl./H. 195.2: St 95: V. 84.8), 65 (19717: St 1: V. 4.4), and 86 (203.25: St 17: V. 16.10), and, more interestingly, the author of Ref. 10.5 in describing heresies couples it with σόφισμα, which is echoed by Marcellus' σοφιστεία here. the the the dogmas of the ancients: for Marcellus the term 8όγμα has a pejorative, secular sense, cf. frs. 39 (Kl./H. 191.16: St 21: V. 20.9), 86 (203.30, 31, 34: St 17: V. 16.15-17, 18. 2), 121 (211.28: St 109: V. 102.5), anB especially 88 (204.15: St 22: V. 22.13), where he speaks of Origen remembering the dogmas of Plato in the opening words of his De princ.

Valentinus Valentinus ...in the book entitled by him On the Three Natures': no such title seems to be attested elsewhere. However, in his researches Marcellus may have come across references to such a book, presumably according to its title on the three elements/ natures identified by the Valentinians (pneumatic, psychic and hylic: cf. Iren. 1.5.1, 6.1, 7.5; Clem. Alex. Exc. ex Theod. 54-57; Ptol. Ep. ad Flor. in Epiph. Haer. 33.7.8 etc.).

Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1992), pp. 269f., also doubts the existence of such a work. It is probably not to be identified with the Tripartite Tripartite Tractate from Nag Hammadi Codex I, as I attempted to argue in 'Origen and the Development of Trinitarian Theology', in L. Lies (ed.), Origeniana Tertia (Innsbruck: Tyrolia, 1987), pp. 424-9. he he was the first to invent three hypostases and three persons: on inventing cf. fr. 65 (Kl./H. 197.19: St 1: V. 4.6). On this claim about three hypostases and persons see 'Development', where I allude to the occurrence of the term and concept of three hypostases in Origen and Plotinus and speculate about its possible first occurrence among the Valentinians. Certainly the Tripartite Tripartite Tractate seems to be developing the basis of a trinitar ian theology distinguishing Father, Son, and Church as coeternal and really existent from the beginning, in a clear attempt to con verge with the theology of the 'Great Church' (cf. NHC I 56.30 59.1 and the more 'orthodox' formula of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in association with baptism in 127.25-128.19). However, the work has been associated with Heracleon and seems later than Valentinus, whose own particular views, as recoverable from Irenaeus and the fragments, do not seem to suggest an obvious triadic structure or the use of terms like hypostasis and prosopon.prosopon. On the other hand, the Gospel of Truth, which some scholars would attribute to Valentinus, does appear to imply a triadic structure of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit active in salva tion and revelation (cf. e.g. NHC I 29.32-30.26). As regards the terms hypostasis and prosopon, Marcellus' phraseology might imply that he makes a distinction between them (see commentary on 2). he he is discovered to have filched this from Hermes and Plato: a passage in the Artemii Passio (28: Bidez-Winkelmann, GCS Philostorgius 160.18f.), which Bidez (LI) thinks derives from a Christian apologetic collection, follows the famous Hermetic quote about the difficulty of grasping God in its shorter form by explaining 'for he is trihypostatic (τρισυπόστατος)'. This might be the source of Marcellus' claim, which Johannes Malalas seems to enlarge upon when he refers to Hermes Trismegistus as speaking of 'three great hypostases... but one godhead' (Chronographia(Chronographia II: PG 97, 92D-93A). As regards Plato, certainly Plotinus claimed support for his three hypostases concept from him and the mysterious passage in the second letter about the</page><page sequence="27">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 107 second and third in particular (Ep. 2 312E, referred to in Enn. 5.1 [10] 8.1-3; cf. 6.7 [38] 42.1-15; 3.5 [30] 8.8; 1.8 [51] 2.28-31). Eusebius refers approvingly both to Plotinus {Enn. 5.1 'On the three primary hypostases') and Plato {Ep. 2 312DE) in Praep. ev.ev. 11.16ff., 20.1—2. And the author of Ref. 6.37.1-6 suggests a Pythagorean origin for Valentinus, adding a reference to Plato {Ep.{Ep. 2 312DE, 313A, 314AC) as the source of Valentinus' three entities, God, the Pleroma, and everything outside it. Marcellus seems to have combined these two pieces of information, the first perhaps from Eusebius or from a Christian anthology of pas sages from Greek writers enlisted in support of Christian ideas rather than direct from Plotinus. We find an extensive anthology of passages from Greek philosophers supposedly borrowed from Moses and supporting monotheism etc. in Cohort. 14-34, not to mention the quotation from Hermes in 38. Tertullian, De anima 2, has Plato as a student of Hermes, and Lactantius derives Plato's views on a first and second god from Hermes (cf. Epit. 37.4-6). See further below. 10. they again devise a second god created by the Father before the ages:ages: cf. frs. 77 (Kl./H. 201.33E: St 91: V. 80.10-12), 40 (Paulinus: 191.29-31: St 121: V. 114.1-3), 18 (Asterius: 188.5f.: St 36: V. 34.tif.), 82 (Eusebius: 203.3f.: St 117: V. no.if.); Eus.

Then again Trismegistus says: the continuation of the passage above, cf. Lact. Inst. 4.6.4 (reading καλό? with S against the κάλλιο?κάλλιο? of A). As Seibt notes, p. 459 n. 882, Lactantius cites both pieces as one and in a longer version, so again he is not the likely source of Marcellus. 12. This then was the source from which their notion of a first and second second god: cf. fr. 80 (Narcissus: Kl./H. 202.25f.: St 124: V. 116.if.). The term 'notion' (οίησι?) occurs in fr. 74 (199.32: St 75: V. 66.6). On Valentinus and Hermes as the sources of the Arian teaching of two gods, principles etc., cf. fr. 85 (St 118). On Hermes and Plato teaching a first and second god cf. Lact. Inst.Inst. 4.6.3f.; Epit. 37.4f. Seibt may be right to suggest, Theologie pp. 458E, that Marcellus probably did not have access to the ori ginal sources here. But on the other hand the author of the Cohortatio,Cohortatio, most likely Marcellus, does seem to have had direct acquaintance with some of the texts he cites, particularly the Platonic, as well as using anthologies (cf. Marcovich's ed. 5; Riedweg, Ps.-Justin 1.72ff.). Since, as noted, Marcellus' source for the Hermetic material does not seem to have been Lactantius or identical with his source, it might have been either another version of the texts themselves, or a Christian flori legium of relevant extracts from pagan (including Hermetic) literature on the themes of three hypostases, two principles or</page><page sequence="29">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 109 gods etc., assembled, of course, not to support such doctrines, like Eusebius' Praep. ev and Dem. ev., but to condemn them.

For Plato speaks ...to Gorgias: this is from Tim. 68E (not C as in Mercati, p. 97 app.), not from the Gorgias. Marcellus' error may be ascribed to his use of a secondary source, or, since he evidently knows and cites the Gorgias (454DE) in fr. 88 (Kl./H. 204.15-21: St 22: V. 22.12-19), perhaps to the kind of carelessness, such as we also find in Ad Graecos (cf. 3.2 on Heraclitus: see on this Riedweg, Ps.-Justin 1.163). Marcellus' quotation, which I have attempted to make intelligible, is a garbled and at times nonsensical version of the received text (see apparatus). again again ...in the same work: from Tim. 52A (not Ε as in Mercati, ibid.), similarly garbled (see app.). Since the author of the Cohortatio,Cohortatio, most likely Marcellus, knows and quotes accurately several well-known passages of the Timaeus, we might incline to the former explanation offered above: these quotations were taken from an anthology based on themes or catch words rather than from the original text. 14. those who fell away from the orthodox faith by not pursuing it intently:intently: Richard, art. cit., p. 8, attaches the orthodox faith to pur suing intently, but since πρόσεχειν is not attested with a genitive, and takes a dative in 16, which has a similar phrase ('deprived of the true knowledge'), my version seems grammatically prefer able.

Now the second cause, Son/ Word... also second principle: Marcellus appears to have Eusebius particularly in his sights (cf. Eus. Praep. ev. 7.1 if.; 11.7, 14—18 (entitled 'On the second cause'); Dem. ev. 5 proem 1, 20, 23, although he denies two prin ciples in Eccl. Theol. 2.7), but perhaps also Asterius. Thus in his letter to Julius he attacks his (unnamed) opponents for teaching 'another Word' (cf. Ep. ad Iul.: Kl./H. 214.28-30: V. 124.19 21). Cf. also Ath. Or. c. Ar. 2.37; Ep. ad ep. Eg. Lib. 12; De syn. 52; Ps.-Ath. Or. c. Ar. 4.1 (attacking dyarchy). On the phrase 'Son/Word' cf. Ep. ad Iul. (Kl./H. 215.5: V. 126.9). they they took from Apelles, Marcion's pupil: Marcellus makes further use of Hippolytus' list in the Syntagma, cf.

Marcellus may be quoting an actual work of Apelles here, or per haps summarizing the quote which Filastrius gives at greater length as a response made by Apelles when questioned by some people about his faith (47.1-3). This may well derive from Hippolytus, either from his Syntagma section on Apelles, or</page><page sequence="31">MARCELLUS OF ANCYRA 111 from a work against Apelles, as possibly attested by Theodoret, Haer.Haer. 1.25. Cf. Epiph. 44.1.4—5. 18. they blaspheme the Holy Spirit... not venerate or revere it... a slave slave and a servant: Eusebius, in his attack on Marcellus, Eccl. theol.theol. 1.10.5 (Kl./H. 69.17E); 2.7.13 (105.33-35), insists that the Church has learned to honour, revere (σεβειν) and venerate (προσκυνεΐσθαι) only the Son. Fragment 14 of an Arian sermon (PL 13, 619A) insists that the Holy Spirit is not God or Lord, not creator or maker, and non colendus neque adorandus. This might suggest that the status of the Holy Spirit was already being debated from the 330s on. Certainly the role and status of the Holy Spirit feature in Eastern and Western credal formulae and doctrinal statements from the Council of Antioch (341) on. Markus Vinzent refers to the essential role played by the Spirit in the letter of the Western Council of Sardica (cf. Theodoret, HE HE 2.8.38E, 48: Pseudo-Athanasius, p. 65). Again Cyril of Jerusalem in 348 insists that the rank of the Holy Spirit is far superior to that of the angels; while they are sent to minister (cf. Heb. 1:14) he searches out the deep things of God (Cat. 16.23; cf■ 16.4). However it is true that the titles of 'slave' and 'servant' for the Holy Spirit only make their appearance from the 370s onwards. Cf. e.g. Eunomius, Lib. apol. 25 (PG 30, 864D: the Paraclete as υπηρέτης)׳, Jerome, Adv. Lucif. 9 (Arian belief in the Holy Spirit as the servus of Father and Son); Arian sermon fr. 3 (PL 13, 601A: the Spirit not God but a δοΰλος); DeDe spir. 19.48, 50 (the Spirit called δούλος). However support for such a usage by Marcellus in the 340s might come from (1) the evidence that Gregory Thaumaturgus had used the term in NeoCaesarea in a confession of faith, denying its applica bility to the Trinity (cf. Greg. Nyss. PG 45, 912E; Tetz, 'Markellianer' p. 80 comm. on 11. 41-42, 47-49), and (2) the fact that what Eugenius (i.e. Marcellus) is conscious of and is rejecting in the 371 confession is the Pneumatomachian claim that the Spirit is created (κτιστός) and 'one of the creatures (ποιήματα)' (Leg.(Leg. 3.1; Tetz p. 80 11. 36E), and not the Anomoean claim about the Spirit as a slave. In any case Marcellus may have been prompted to focus on the Spirit by his heresiological cata logue which began with Dositheus and the Sadducean denial of the Spirit.

The insinuation that 'those of their party' thereby 'harvested the name of the schismatic heresiarch' (i.e. Arius) and forfeited the name of Catholic could then be very plaus ibly interpreted as an allusion to the Council's condemnation of Ursacius and Valens as Arians teaching three diverse hypostases (cf. doctrinal statement of Western Council of Sardica in Ath.
