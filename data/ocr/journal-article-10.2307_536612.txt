<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODERN GREEK FOLKLORE: THE SMERDAKI* By PAN. S. CODELLAS The various peoples or tribes which migrated and settled peacefully or descended in waves and conquered the indigenous inhabitants of what is known to us as Hellas created, by an amalgamation of diverse elements, a unified group, the Hellenic people who, after several social and political vicis- situdes instituted a new religion and a stable pantheon. Simultaneously and unconsciously, they also built up a rich counterpart of their gods of Olympus, a body of traditional beliefs of lasting character. The Hellenic ethnos amassed, I may say, the discards and waste of thought and wisdom, out of date beliefs, side by side with sound knowledge of great antiquity. Herein lies the riches of present-day Greek folklore, which is a shadowy and flimsy creation replete with superstitions and unfounded ac- ceptances of truths and tales, embracing almost every phase of human effort, knowledge, and experience. These survivals resist alterations and reforms through the advancement of positive knowledge, and will persist as long as village and country life last; they only become attenuated in enlightened ur- ban life, but are never extirpated from the minds of the credulous. A mar- velous and monstrous world usually emerges into sovereign power on the point of the Mystic Midnight Hour, and holds domination to the first crowing of the cock. I may call the creatures of this world collectively, The Zero Hour World. In this immense and heterogeneous heap of folkloristic survivals items exist of medical significance, creations of anthropomorphic causalities: Vrachnas (personification of hoarseness or choking), the Plague, the Cholera, Tuberculosis, Small Pox, and other diseases, to name only a few. THE PELASGI Of all the peoples of the pre-Hellenic period of Greece who invaded the country and finally settled and established Greece's civilization, culture, lan- guage, and religion the Pelasgi stand out as the most important group. A dynasty of Pelasgic chiefs existed in Greece before any other dynasty is men- tioned in Greek traditions. Some represent Peloponnesus as the original seat of the Pelasgians. The Arcadians were always considered by the Greeks them- selves as pure Pelasgians, and a Pelasgian dynasty reigned in Arcadia until the Second Messenian War (Herodotus). Some writers have maintained that the Greeks derived the art of writing and most of their religious rites from the Pelasgians .... The powers that preside over husbandry and protect the fruits of the earth and growth of the flocks appear to have been the oldest Pelasgian divinities (Anthon). The pastoral mode of life of the Arcadians explains their attachment to music; and hence also the worship of Pan as the tutelary deity of Arcadia. "The ancient Arcadians congregated and formed the first city the Sun set its light upon, Mantineia" (Eleutheriades). * The essence of this paper was presented before the XIth International Congress of the His- tory of Medicine at Zagreb, Yugoslavia, I938. 236</page><page sequence="2">Modern Greek Folklore: The Smerdaki PAN To the primitive Arcadians Pan was their protector, giver of good fortune, Lord of Nature. On his will depended the health of man and flock, the in- crease of the flock, and the abundance of life-supporting foodstuffs. He was the Lord of everything that man needed, was Everything, All. The principal home of Pan and his cult from very ancient times had been Peloponnesus, which Pania was called. And Peloponnesian was a synonym of Arcadian, according to Sophocles, Hesychius and Stephanus Byzantius. Arcadia is his native country; Arcadia was the cradle of the cult of Pan. His appearance seems to coincide with the first steps of man in Peloponnesus to master Na- ture. He is as old as the first step to tame Nature and extract existence. He almost remained in his original form through the long mastery of the land. Singularly enough the concept of Pan is unmixed with foreign elements, ac- cording to several authorities. Pan in his earliest locality, Mount Lycaeus (Arcadia), where he appeared and was established as a deity, shared equal honors with Zeus. Pan was prior to and superior to Zeus in all other places. His domain covers mountain peaks, valleys, meadows, canyons, streams, and grottoes. The ancients had two forms representing Pan; the first, a red wrinkled face, horned head, flat nose, and goat like legs, thighs, tail and feet. As time went by artists sought to humanize Pan and soften the idea of the shepherds, and they portrayed him as a young man hardened by the toils of country life. Short horns sprout on his forehead to characterize him, he carries a crook and syrinx, and he is either naked or clad in a light cloak called a chlamys. Names by which Pan is designated are Aigipan, Goat-Pan, Goat-horned. Pan as the chief god of the Pelasgic pantheon was able to do good by pro- tecting and increasing the flocks, and evil by sending diseases to mankind and also to animals. Those of his aspects which are of medical interest are that he knew the simples, the art of curing, knew the future (prognosis) and could reveal it to man, could cause nightmares, panic and diseases. This mighty god deeply rooted in the soil of Arcadia holds sway even today in the same local- ity, but in a sort of distorted figure; covered with the moss of time he has become unrecognizable; he has sunk into the substratum of the past and lives only in the traditions. But as a survival through the ages the tradition of to- day is almost the same as the original acceptance. InArcadia around Mainalos, the sacred mountain of Pan, the tradition so persists that the inhabitants of this district insist they hear the god whistling-an unbroken thread of sur- vival. In other parts of Greece also fragments of Pan-residuum have come down to us, as in Zakynthos and Parnassos. The monuments of the ancient Pan corroborate and identify him as the hairy man that mounts the animals, taking their form or the form of a hairy child. The forms show the unchanged tradition. The bestiality goes back to the life history of Pan. THE DEMONS In addition to the known principal gods with well defined mastery of na- ture's forces a multitude of anonymous spirits have survived which bear a generic name and represent qualities with divine simple faculties. These are 237</page><page sequence="3">Journal of American Folklore the Demons (Daimones), the so-called abstract deities. The term means es- pecially the dark and invisible actions upon the world and more specifically those which are undefinable and have something ununderstandable, mystic, magic and inimical. The connotation is extracted from the words demon and demoniacal (daimon, daimonios). The word demoniacal (daimonios) ex- presses more clearly the demon's bad meaning; it is never equivalent to divine. By demon Homer means divinity in general, but by demoniacal more fre- quently the mysterious and injurious agency, a quality, which the man does not understand and cannot personify. The demon directs the fates of man- kind, sends to them good and bad fortune, he is protector of men; he also sends forth bad fortune and diseases. The latter meaning and belief has been prevalent more and more until finally it means the bad demon, or the devil. The general group of demons, which probably were of several gradations in faculties and potency, comprised, as might be expected, a group to be ac- credited for protecting and responsible for the welfare of the flocks or to be censured for the ill-luck of the same. It seems they are the unorganized prin- ciples and forces, projected into definite deities, in days before the pantheon of the Pelasgians. Here we find the goat-formed Satyrs. According to the forementioned meaning of the term demon the shepherds' demons share the bad reputation. The life and experience of the shepherds offered ample op- portunity for their simple imagination to create groups of spirits representing natural forces, with blurred delineation as demons. Satyrs and Tityrs were thought of as he-goats according to the scholiast of Theocrit: "They call Tityrs he-goats (Hesychius)." Hesychius interprets he-goats as Satyrs and homologues to Pan. This is shown in Pan being one of the Dionysiac train. The Satyrus of the Arcadian plain is recorded as a bad and destructive demon. The tradition of demons among present-day shepherds, the form and facul- ties of such demons, can easily be traced to distant antiquity, extending to prehistoric times in Greece. The region in which the best light is thrown on this subject is Arcadia where beliefs about the ancient shepherds' demons of archaic times have survived almost unaltered through the ages. The main form of demons in modern Greek folklore is that of a he-goat or similar crea- ture; the devil also is represented as he-goat. The Satyr that injures the herds takes the form of a buck-goat; in the guise of a bull it attacks the cattle. The shapes of the animal are similar to those of antiquity: bull, ram, dog, hairy man, also hairy child. The beliefs about sexual intercourse have been in- herited through tradition from the ancient times, as is shown from the myth of the Arcadian Satyr. Pan is called aigovates, chimerovates, goat or chimera mounting, and as such is represented in some monuments. THE SMERDAKI I have selected from the vast material of Hellenic folklore a subject that has its origin, I may say, in the depths of Greek pre-history and in distorted form is still accepted as a living creature. This apparition is one that causes disease directly to animals and occasionally, indirectly, to man. This demon is known by several appellations in many regions of Greece, but I will use that under which it is generally spoken of in Arcadia, its home and principal 238</page><page sequence="4">Modern Greek Folklore: The Smerdaki domain. The material for this discussion has been mainly collected by me as a native of Arcadia, where collecting opportunities were plentiful; information is first hand since I was for years in constant contact with persons who had actually experienced the events recorded, or were witnesses of them. The invaluable studies and collections of N. G. Polites, the father of Greek La- ography (Folklore) have been freely used; without them my theme would have been shallow and incomplete indeed. Present-day names for the herds' demons are several, although these do denote some differences in their activities and abilities, the latter are for the most part the same, and such apparitions cannot be identified by activities in the numerous localities. The demons are referred to variously as chamodraki, smerdaki; or by names with general ideas, idolon, zoulapi, lavoma, diavolos, demonio, daimonismeno; or by euphemistic names, glykiasmeno (the sweete ened one), ameleteto (not to be thought of, not to be mentioned), eremo (dis- astrous, desert causing), apocoromeno (stinky, nasty), and so forth; or local proper names, as Phintis, Koletta. In Arcadia the name in use is Smerdaki and this will be adhered to in this study, although all the names of these de- mons are interrelated and interchanged in guilt. To the minds of the herdsmen they are almost synonymous. Chamodraki derives from chamai, on the ground, and dracos, unchristened or exposed infant. In Byzantine times the term Chameureton (found exposed, deserted on the ground) is used (Jus- tinian, Suidas). The Greek Orthodox church considers unbaptized dead in- fants or children as tainted with the sin of the first created human beings, Adam and Eve, and therefore it is impossible for them to be admitted to paradise. Smerdaki (by misuse smidraki, smithraki) derives from smerdos, old term smerdnos, of which probably there was a form used, smerdos, as it is apparently smerdaleos, smerdos, eusmerdos (smerdos: force, dynamis, or- mina, according to Hesychius): this is similar to the old difficult, bad; the latter meaning has dominated the popular conception. Children born out of wedlock become Smerdakia, or demons destroying the herds, and were called smerda, smerdakia, a diminutive term, meaning terrible, destructive, bad. The adjective smerdos is also applied to the offspring of persons of two dif- ferent races, or two nationalities. In Epirus (Zagoria) smerdeno means to adulterate; for example, adulterated wine, crasi smerdemeno. The male born bastard becomes the shepherds' demon (which reminds one of adulterous Pan). According to other beliefs the unbaptized infants become demons of several types, among which one category is Smerdaki; similarly, children who are born and die unbaptized during the Dodekaemero, the twelve days from the birth of Christ to His Baptism become demons. Of interest are the notions and beliefs of the inhabitants of the Thracian shore of the Euxine Pontus, in the province of Typhle (Kior-kaza) where the entire evolution of the theme of this paper survives from Bacchus' times (A. Chourmouzides, 1873, quoted by Polites). These beliefs as Polites ascertains exist only among the Greeks. In general there is no definite locale or chosen location which the demon frequents and where he makes his appearance. In numerous instances the destructive spirit springs up in a certain spot which has nothing in its precise past history or connection or association to identify it with such spirits. 239</page><page sequence="5">Journal of American Folklore Demons usually confine their activities to certain wooded plots, forests, can- yons, mountain peaks, and to the vicinity of rocks of considerable size which are awesome and excite curiosity. They also frequent enclosures, hedges, ruins of houses, deserted habitations, grottoes; spots where the goats rest, sleep or are herded; wheat stacks, floors where the wheat is threshed. Among their haunts we hear of churches, chapels, lakes, Turkish cemeteries. It is believed that generally demons originate in places where infants born out of wedlock were exposed or buried; also where unbaptized infants were interred. In regard to the time of the appearance nothing is definite; it seems to be "during the night," and long before daybreak; the opinion prevails that the midnight hour is the one most often chosen by the demon. A shepherds' demon, as it has been asserted by eyewitnesses of his acts, frequently appears as a man whose body is covered with hair from head to toes, or as a ram with black patches on his forehead. Some herdsmen declared the form under which they saw the apparition was that of a hunting dog or a small dog, which at times has been said to be red. Others maintain that the shape in which it had been seen was that of a he-goat, sometimes of red color, although generally of a more usual color. Other demons are said to take the form of a hairy infant or child, whose age was estimated as being about forty days, having hair and teeth, and spitting fire. A small number of observers say that the demons were several in number and looked like hybrid cats and were making noises like the cries of infants. Another group of shepherds has seen the demon as a red child, like fire with the eyes of a cat, or as a billy- goat whose eyes were flame-red and whose toes had nails. The Smerdaki infuses unfounded fear and causes wild running, thus dis- persing the flock. It effects abortion, taking the form of the animal that is to be attacked, bull, he-goat, ram. The usual shape is of a ram and especially that of a goat. It mounts and copulates with cattle and sheep but seldom with goats; occasionally it attacks man and rarely, mares. The animals so attacked die. It is reported that on one occasion the product of such conceptions were black lambs. The Smerdaki cannot be killed, wounded or injured, no matter what means are used, although some shepherds have fired their shotguns at it; guns fired at it usually explode and often kill the person who fires them. These would-be-killers also develop the malignant postule (kako spiri). Dogs that have chased a Smerdaki die. The injury from an attack by a Smerdaki involves the genital region of the victim, which on inspection appears to be traumatized extensively: "there is a gaping jagged wound, which drips blood." As soon as the animal is attacked it begins to be "sick." The abdomen increases in size, swells up immensely and becomes progressively and tensely tympanitic. As time passes the symp- toms continue; the animal drops to the ground; the signs do not abate during the remainder of the night; at dawn or when the cock crows all the animals die. The dead animal becomes "very heavy" and very difficult to lift or han- dle. The flesh of the victims is not eaten, even by dogs. Attacks are not fatal to all men, but some die from "being scared;" "all their bloods turns into pus, as in the sheep and goats." Men who skin or dress the dead animals in the usual old fashioned manner (by making an opening 240</page><page sequence="6">Modern Greek Folklore: The Smerdaki in one of the hind legs and inserting a wooden rod which is run under the skin to loosen it around the legs and the abdomen and then blowing into the opening and inflating the entire subcutaneous space) develop on their lips or chin a malignant pustule (kako spiri.) Some go through the same stages as the sheep. It is hard to cure such an ailment. One man was treated for months by an empiric medicine woman (mantistra) and finally was cured. The pus- tule thus developed on the chin or lip is called by the shepherds geladoponos, or provatoponos, 'cow-sore,' or 'sheep-sore.' To prevent abortion holy water is sprinkled over the pasture or baptismal mass is read and then the specially and freshly sanctified water is used in the same manner. Advice is given to the shepherd; he "must not shed blood in his herd," that is not kill any animal, "for this act will make things worse." Sometimes three priests are engaged; these wear the full ecclesiastical robes and carry the holy articles including the holy chalice or eucharist cup, in exactly the same manner as though officiating at a regular mass in church. The priests, villagers and herdsmen all assemble on the plot where the flock grazes or where it is feeding, or where it is stationed, or where it had been attacked. All go around following the boundary line of the pasture, at the same time singing ecclesiastical hymns or chanting church compositions or prayers. At several points a wooden cross is fixed in the ground. After this ceremony is performed the Smerdaki does not molest the animals any more. Another preventive measure is to transfer the herd to another pasture, causing it to pass through a village; this leaves the disease in that village. The shepherds take the precaution to have the bells of the animals plugged, in order to escape detection, for if they are found out, they will be killed by the people of the transit village. The human beings of the transit village suffer nothing. Other shepherds transfer the herd to another spot with the tongues of the bells taken off, in order to avoid the demon's noticing where they have moved to; thus the new location will be unknown. If it is feared that the transit through a village will be detected, that resistance will be aroused and the transit will not be accomplished, the shepherds engage three priests and the same ceremony is performed as above described. Sometimes the owner of the flock takes the bells off and drives the sheep around a country side chapel and fires three shots, then he transfers them to an old windmill which is out of condition and not in use and himself takes care of the herd until fatal cases cease. One month afterwards he puts new bells on the flock and turns the sheep over to the hired man or to the common shepherd of the village. That the Smerdaki may not mount the rest of the ewes of the flock "the well known procedure" takes place: they collect all sorts of old and discarded shoes from exhumed bodies in the cemeteries, as well as horns of goats, and hair clipped off the tail and gluteal region of the animals; to these is added pitch. They burn them all to ashes; during this burning a strong odor rises over the whole place. From the blackened mass they make a nasty mixture of the consistency of dough, and smear this with a stick over the genital regions of the ewes. The demon never revisists the herd. The foul odor drives it far away, one thousand paces. 24I</page><page sequence="7">Journal of American Folklore Some people do not believe in these exorcistic rituals and leave everything to fate, confessing the impossibility of keeping away or expelling the demon by such procedures. The following is told by the son of an eyewitness and participant in the entire system of rites for expelling the Smerdaki: They had heard that in Langadia [Arcadia], I believe, I do not know exactly where, there was an old man called Zoodiares, because he could work magic on the Zoodia [exotic creatures, preternatural quasi-animals, animal destructive demons]. He prom-. ised to drive away the phantom in three days. He gave orders to have made in the city and brought to him three long spikes, as long as a man's handspan. My father, blessed be his memory, went himself and had made to order these spikes, bought them and brought them to the man. He told me all this. My father also was present and witnessed the whole performance of the exorcism. The Zoodiares took along all the available shepherds fully armed with their flint and lock rifles, spade handles, shovels, and sticks. At night they went to the canyon. The Zoodiares ran in all direc- tions, as if he was chasing the Zoodi, but he could not make it appear or leave its hiding place. Then he said some words not of the ordinary kind and not understood by any one present; then the demon appeared. Now the two wrestled, Zoodiares and the Smerdaki; my father saw this and two or three others, but none else, because those can see such things whose "shadow is light;" this enables them to see phan- toms, ghosts and such creatures. The Zoodiares goes after her (Koletta, that's the name of this particular Smerdaki), chases her beyond the village limit. Then all raised a cry, as they do especially when they scare away dogs. Near the countryside chapel of St. George he wrestled his best, compared to previous rounds, and forced her to her knees; then he drove the three spikes into her body. She had huge and terrible teeth; she laid there with wide open mouth and upturned eyes and a terrifying look. She surely was driven away. She never appeared again. Later she made her appearance in Mercovouni, her new location, where she did great damage and she still does to this day. Some nearby villagers learned these words of power, but they do not tell these to others. The clinical picture drawn in plain words and based on observations of persons who are not trained, but nevertheless note the major signs, cor- responds admirably to that of anthrax, especially the intestinal type. The cutaneous form in man is certainly the same condition, and bears a direct connection with the infected animal. Any textbook of medicine discussing an- thrax will verify the diagnosis of this endemic malady. In addition the means of prophylaxis and cure support the general topic. Each clinical point and therapeutic measure excepting the theurgic concur to the capital theme. It appeared to me that it would be of interest to discover what becomes of these survivals when the inhabitants of Arcadia immigrate to the United States. In America urbanization certainly has taken place. Men who in their homeland were shepherds are familiar with the activities of Smerdaki and the beliefs of the pastoral folk who lead almost the same life as the ancient Ar- cadians, under the same conditions and upon the same sites. The Greek- American shepherds of past or present with great flocks of sheep in Idaho, Colorado and California although cognizant of the Smerdaki beliefs and ac- tions now discard all these stories and mistrust them as superstititions, saying "the old folks did not know any better." An old lady of over eighty-five years, 242</page><page sequence="8">Modern Greek Folklore: The Smerdaki born and raised under the shadow of Mainalos Mountain, who was a shep- herdess when young and whose parental and conjugal relatives owned flocks of sheep and goats answered referring to Smerdaki: Why in the name of Our Virgin Mary, your mind goes to this thing? You must not talk about it; such things are not to be discussed; you should not even mention them. I don't know anything about it; I heard about it; I have not seen it myself and none of my people are sure to have seen it. Nobody has seen it for sure. The following incident explains the origin, fabrication and propagation of the belief concerning the Smerdaki and the misunderstood real cause of the fatal disease of the flocks. This case was related to N. G. Polites by A. E. Arvanitopoulos. In Tripolis [Arcadia] during the year I891 two men died. The victims had eaten of the flesh of a cow which was sick. This by the inhabitants of Basiakou, Mantzagra, Sechi, and of other thereby villages was translated into the tale that Phintis, the ter- rible Smerdaki of Volimi copulated with the cow and her meat became infected and not eatable and the cause of death. The death was the result of infection of Anthrax, as it was proven by medical examination and bacteriological study. Thus the myste- rious actions of Smerdaki were unmasked and were explained by science. CONCLUSION Arcadia was the seat of the Pelasgians. Pan from a primitive mountain spirit became their principal god. The forces of nature which could not be explained were accredited to de- mons. The form of demons was that of he-goats. Pan is also represented as a man and goat combined. The form of the present day Smerdaki, the destructive demon of flocks, is usually that of a he-goat. A continuity of form, faculties, activities, and a strong inheritance of the dark side of Pan is apparent. A case analyzed and investigated proved to be endemic Anthrax. The history of Pelasgi, Arcadia, Pan, and Demons show the antiquity of the tradition from primitive to modern life. The Smerdaki of the present day is the direct heir to an unbroken line of illustrious ancestors. A bold, vivid mosaic of the dark side of Pan and Demons is presented. The foregoing is an admirable and singular example of distorted and superstitiously surviving cause and effect explanation.
