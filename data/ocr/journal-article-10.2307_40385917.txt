" 404</page><page sequence="5">Guidelines for Contributors 1. Manuscripts (including an abstract of 150-200 words) should be sent to the Editor at freudent@msh-paris.fr as an attachment. Submissions will be considered for publication on the understanding that they are unpublished and not on offer to another journal. 2. Articles will be put through a process of double-blind refereeing. Accordingly, authors should avoid any identifying references in their submissions and provide a separate title page with their name, address, and institutional affiliation. 3. Style: Spelling and typographical conventions follow American usage; in general, authors should follow the Chicago Manual of Style. 4. Transliterations from Hebrew and Arabic follow the usual scholarly practice. This means doubling consonants to indicate the dagesh/shadda, h for het/hã, s for sade/sãd, t for tetltà, s for shin, s for sin, ' for yalef/'atif-hamza, and c for cayin/ceyn. Bars over letters (or a circumflex) may be used to indicate long vowels in Arabic. Names and terms that have been integrated into English should not be transliterated: e.g., Saadia Gaon rather than Sacadiah Ga'on, Maimonides rather than Moshe ben Maimón, caliph rather than khalïfah, Koran or Quran rather than Qur'an, etc. In general, simplicity should be preferred to complexity if that does not cause a loss of significant information. We suggest that you employ a font that contains all the required diacriticals, such as Times Beyrut Roman, which is free for downloading from various sites. If you cannot use this (or a similar) font, please indicate underdots within angle brackets before the consonant and alef/ayin by the appropriate single quote, again within angle brackets before the vowel (e.g., Dalãlat al-ha'iñn. 5. Notes. Please use endnotes, numbered consecutively. 405</page><page sequence="6">6. Bibliographical information. References should be given in the endnotes (not parenthetically in the text). Provide full bibliographical details at the first mention of a work (indicate, if possible, the publisher in addition to place and year of publication); subsequent references should use the author's surname and a short title (not op. cit.). References to classic texts available in different editions or translations should be non-edition-specific, followed by indication of the specific edition or translation employed. Examples for bibliographical information at first occurrence: Moses Maimonides, Dalãlat al-haiñn 2:19; ed. I. Joel (Jerusalem, 1930/31), p. 40b. Moses Maimonides, Moreh ha-nevukim 2:19; Heb. trans. Samuel Ibn Tibbon, éd. Y. Even-Shmuel (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1987), p. 265. Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed 2:19; trans. Shlomo Pines (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), pp. 304-305. Examples for subsequent references: Maimonides, Dalalah 2:19 (ed. Joel, p. 40b). Maimonides, Moreh nevukim 2:19 (ed. Even-Shmuel, p. 265). Maimonides, Guide 2:19 (trans. Pines, pp. 304-305). Articles in periodicals or serial publications: Bernard R. Goldstein, "Preliminary Remarks on Levi ben Gerson's Contributions to Astronomy," Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Science and Humanities 3 (1969): 239-54. If the reference is to a specific page or pages, add, e.g., a(on p. 240)." [Note that p. or pp. is not required in this format.] Subsequent references: Goldstein, "Preliminary Remarks," p. 240. 406</page><page sequence="7">References to articles in collections or anthologies should combine the above formats. For example: Shlomo Pines, "The Limitations of Human Knowledge according to Al-Färäbi, Ibn Bãjja, and Maimonides," pp. 82-109 in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature, ed. Isadore Twersky (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1979). Add, if relevant, "on p. 105." [Note that the inclusive page numbers precede the title of the collection.] Hebrew and Arabic books and journals often carry titles in English; if this is the case, use them (rather than a transliteration of the title). Examples: Rina Drory, The Emergence of Jewish-Arabic Literary Contacts at the Beginning of the Tenth Century (Heb.) (Tel Aviv: ha-Kibbutz ha-Meuhad, 1988); Ben-Zion Dinaburg, " 'Modern Times' in Jewish History" (Heb.), lion 13-14 (1948/49): 63-105. It is a courtesy to one's readers to translate titles in languages one suspects they may not know (e.g., Evreiskoe mestechko ν revoliutsii [The Jewish town in revolution]). Note that only the first word and proper nouns should be capitalized in the translated title. 7. Submission of an article is understood to imply that if the article is published in Aleph, the author will transfer copyright to the journal. 8.
