<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME FEATURES OF BASQUE FOLKLORE THESE few notes on Basque folklore refer to certain religious observances in the Basses Pyre6nes, the western Basque region in France, north of the Pyrenees and inland from Bayonne, along the " gave " or stream which runs down from Saint Jean Pied du Port. In the more eastern district of La Soule I believe the customs are very similar,with more or less accentu- ation on certain points. I was in the Basses Pyr6nees, also for a day in San Sebastian over the Spanish frontier, early in June 1928, too late for the spring customs, the carneval, cavalcades, or the Easter processions, and too early for the rites of midsummer, which include Saint John's Eve fires, still lighted among the Basques as in many parts of central Europe. I was there specially to see the village processions in commemoration of Corpus Christi. This festival falls on the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday, and under the jurisdiction of the higher clergy in the larger towns it is observed with great ceremony on that day. But in the country districts Sunday is the only day possible for such celebration among the farming population during the busy June month, and the festival is kept on the Sunday following the correct date, or at the octave a week later. I was indebted to a folklore friend, a collector of Basque folk-music, for information as to where the festival procession might best be seen, and we were so fortunate as to find ourselves the only onlookers in the small hamlet of M..., half-way up a lonely hillside. We were there by 10 a.m., and soon after the villagers began to collect at the church-porch. At this and most other festivals every man, woman and child in the parish attends, unless too decrepit to move. We stood beside a low stone wall and noted the various characters of the procession as they walked up the green lanes, already dressed, but quite unconscious of the incongruity of their costumes. There was a gay drum-major with drum and baton, a conspicuous person with braided coat, called the ". Suisse ", some soldiers carrying bayonets, a village band playing Basque tunes and six or eight little girls called angels, in white, with white wreaths and small baskets of red roses, attended by an equal number of small boys, also in white. Most conspicuous of all were four tall men with large white aprons tied at the back; they wore large busbies on their heads adorned with small pieces of mirror shining in the sunshine, which are believed to ward off the influence of the evil eye. The busbies were originally of bear-skin, but today an imitation of bear-skin serves as well. These characters as- sembled in procession quite gravely and simply, the children walking in the rear ; all was taken as a matter of course. The women in their black dresses took their places in the nave, the men climbed up to the wooden galleries running down the sides of the church. The drum-major took up</page><page sequence="2">366 Collectanea his position in front of the altar with the busbie-wearers and the small girls and boys on each side, the soldiers lined the central aisle and the " Suisse " collected alms. This " Suisse " may be possibly a stray element from some courtly ceremonial of Navarre, the other characters bear evidence of evolution from folk custom. The whole is a blend of ancient cults and military parade with Christian observance, a strange amalgam for a Corpus Christi celebration. After the service and a sermon preached in Basque, came the elevation of the Host ; at this the soldiers presented arms, the drum-major twirled his baton vigorously, and the busbies were taken off. In some villages the people have been known to break into a dance of exaltation at this moment, and to move dancing out of the church. At M ... they walked out gravely and waited for the priest bearing the Host. From the church a path strewn with plucked grass and rushes led to the R6posior, about 300 yards away. Women unrolled a strip of linen over the grasses, and on this the priest walked. The path of a girl going to her first communion is strewn with fresh grasses in the same way ; these are never cut with a knife. At the R6posior, where fresh flowers decorated the temporary covering of a small shrine, the Host was elevated again. The people then again followed the priest carrying the sacred elements back to the church. At leaving the church the second time, the band played Basque tunes and the people came out dancing a slow processional folk-dance. On the green outside other folk-dances were enjoyed before the people separated. Later in the afternoon we saw a Corpus Christi procession in the larger village of Armentieres. The curator of the Basque museum at Bayonne was present, with other visitors. Here the dresses were richer and the procession had the character of a pageant. A native of the village had returned home from the Argentine with a full purse; he had rebuilt and enlarged his old home in the small square and was known as a patron of local customs, giving presents of handsome costumes and of instruments for the band. What the ceremony gained in splendour it lost in simplicity and charm. The drum-major in particular was a very pompous, self- conscious being and the dancers were more ambitious. The men wearing white aprons and mirror-decked busbies, however, were the same as those at M.... Still later in the afternoon we saw the close of a third celebration, with the same features, in another village after vespers. A week later the celebration was held at Itxassou, late in the evening while the rain was falling. In spite of the rain every detail was faithfully carried out. The R6posior had been built up naively against the high wall of the Pelote ground. The busbies carried their mirror charms and the " angels " wore their wreaths and baskets; the roll of linen was laid over the plucked grass on the path. Here the " grande dame " of the village, the owner of the hotel, hung from the upper windows long sheets of fine white linen, a family heirloom of which she was very proud. After the return to the church the skies cleared and there were many dances, the Fandango among others. At San Sebastian in Spain the service in the church was strictly ortho-</page><page sequence="3">Collectanea 367 dox in character, and was held at the correct date in the old church, Santa Maria, standing with its back to the rocks, a significant position to students of folklore. All was in keeping with religious rule. There was no sign either of the busbies or the drum-major. One old custom, how- ever, had made its way back to the procession. For many years Guipuzcoan sword-dancers had walked following the bishop, twelve of them, dressed in white with red berets and sashes, carrying their swords against their shoulders. After the procession had returned from its passage round the town the sword-dancers danced an ancient sword-dance before the church door. This dance resembles in many ways the English Morris dance with swords, the swords are interlaced during the dance, which keeps its traditional steps very strictly and moves to Basque airs. Church authority had dismissed the dancers as unsuited to a Corpus Christi procession and they were discountenanced as pagan. I had been told in Bayonne that a new bishop, a Basque, had restored the dancers to the procession, but when I made enquiries about them at the hotel and in the town I found myself looked upon as a foreigner making impious sugges- tions. A Basque servant at the hotel, however, said that the dancers were to appear, and so they did, walking sedately behind the bishop seated in a covered litter and bearing the Host. Before him walked the little girl angels and their boy attendants, following a long line of figures of great pomp and magnificence. On the return of the procession from its long perambulation of the town, it moved into the church. A small Basque band played with a town band, not very harmoniously; the sword-dancers retired without dancing. I followed the crowd to the Place of the Concepcion where twelve boys danced with short swords, holding one in each hand. These boys had also stood at the church door, they were dressed in white and red like the older youths but wore long white stockings cross-gartered in red. It was said that the sword-dancers would dance after the procession on the church terrace as in older times in the following year, 1929. At intervals during the afternoon musicians from the hills above San Sebastian played Basque tunes on instruments of ancient Guipuzcoan origin, they stood in small alleys and corners a little way back from the larger streets and did not collect money from the passers-by. The Basque church with its graveyard is the centre of the village life, sharing its pre-eminence only with the old ball-game of P6lote and its ground. In Bayonne itself the game is played against the wall of the cathedral. In the villages the church bell tolls once a day for a week after the death of a resident. I saw a baby buried one rainy evening in the church-yard at Itxassou. While the small coffin was above ground the bell was jangled wildly to keep away evil spirits, after the burial, when the body had been put away under the ground and the burial service had been said, the same bell tolled reverently. This blending of older cults with Christian observance is marked indelibly on the Basque tombstones, now being collected and set out to view in the local museums. None of these stones found up to the present</page><page sequence="4">368 Collectanea are dated earlier than the thirteenth century, but their origin is probably from more remote times. They are called discoidal because of the round disc at the top of the slab; in museum catalogues they are sometimes described as anthropomorphic, as there are grounds for believing that the disc represented a human face. There are many marks of ancient cults cut on the surface of the slab. Sun and moon figures, magic symbols and carvings known to be charms against illness among sheep and cattle, these last on the grave-stones of stock owners. They also often bear the house sign of the family buried beside them; many Basque houses have their owp sign, for the house is always associated with the family, which is " of that ilk ", as the Scotch say. Men and women of standing in Basque villages take their name from their house. These discoidal tombstones are now much defaced and almost always have a cross carved on them, thus Christianized. A careful study of them has been made in the form of a finely illustrated monograph, accepted by the French Academy. The author traces a connection in the discoidal form and some of the symbols with stones rarely noted in Scotland and elsewhere. One or two of the signs have not met with an interpretation, not surprising when we remember that they were traced by a people of obscure origin whose language still baffles the research of trained philologists. The Pyrenaic region lies within the area of Megalithic culture in western Europe, a culture with a developed grave cult, whose ghostly preoccupations, as they have been called, absorbed all other energies. Much has been written about the tutelary goddess of the dead in that cult, and her possible con- nection with the Great Mother of Crete and the 1Egean. Her menhir statue, known in Megalithic areas in southern France, is however of a very different shape from a discoidal slab, and no one has proposed to look for a connection between them. In this region we may note another practice of the church to leave unreproved violent expressions of popular resentment against actions not condemned by itself. The Basques have, for instance, certain repugnances not observed in all other parts of France in matrimonial matters. They dislike second marriages and abhor a marriage between a young man"and an older woman. Should such a marriage take place the villagers assemble at sunset before the offenders' house with bells, metal vessels, drums, wooden batons, with anything in fact that can be used in making a noise.1 The hideous din raised by these instruments is kept up through the night till daybreak, sleep is impossible and the scorning rite is felt as a cruel insult to those who have disregarded a deep-rooted and traditional senti- ment. Basques who have been singled out for reprobation in this way will sometimes move away from their native village, so keenly do they feel the disgrace. Yet the Basque priest takes no notice and makes no enquiry, although in the general life of the parish he does his best to uphold peace and goodwill. M. M. BANKS 1 This custom has been treated very fully by Van Geunep, and by Miss Violet Alford.</page></plain_text>
