<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stathis Gourgouris Every Religion Is Idolatry THE ASSERTION I HAVE CHOSEN FOR A TITLE IS A QUOTATION FROM a very important essay by Cornelius Castoriadis on the imaginary insti tution of religion. This essay is unique in his overall oeuvre and has not really received the attention it deserves. It is especially pertinent to the discussion of political theology and the question of what politics theol ogy mobilizes. Before I address Castoriadis's essay and the quotation specifically, let me first say a few words, by way of introduction, about political theology, not in the abstract but specifically about the ques tion of its politics. Since the term "political theology" established itself fully in the academic theoretical scene—I wouldn't quite date it with the advent of the Carl Schmitt obsession but rather with the secularism obsession, which emerged about 10 years ago—the term it overtook and silenced was not "political theory," as Paul Kahn argues in his recent book, Political Theology: Four New Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty (2011), but rather "political economy." The eclipse of political economy as a primary interpretive concept is all the more stunning given the dire circumstances of our day, when the power of the economic sphere has come to occupy the political in undisguised fashion. While since Marx we have known that economic interests ultimately determine the polit ical trajectory of societies, we have now come to see economic agents explicitly exercising governmental power—not only according to the well-documented control of American government officials by Wall St. lobbyists but even the appointment of unelected trained bankers or financial managers to positions of heads-of-state (note Greece and Italy in 2011-2012). Such is the state of what, especially after the American constitutional precedent of Citizens United, signifies the deregulation of social research Vol. 80 : No. 1 : Spring 2013 101</page><page sequence="2">the political. Both names are absurd. The first one is relentlessly sarcas tic and even cruel; the Supreme Court of the United States has legalized the annihilation of citizenship by legislating the economic determina tion of the citizen. My naming is just ironic. Deregulation has always been, even in strict economic terms, about specific (partial and stealth, but nonetheless hardcore) regulation: in other words, invisible rules (in the name of no rules) whose benefit is not only to maximize control of the game by those who gain from it but exterminate those who oppose them (Gourgouris 2013). So, in a context where the economic is exercising explicit regu lation over the sphere of the political while simultaneously effacing "political economy" from the language of social and historical analysis, it seems even more problematic to me that the political is ever more thought to be determined by the theological. It is not only that the famous Carl Schmitt quotation ("all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts")1 seems to be circulated ad absurdum as fact; it is that, even in its own terms, Schmitt's dictum has been irresponsibly considered. To say that some thing has been secularized, grammatically speaking, is to mean that an action has been taken upon this something and that this something (the "theological") has thereby been altered. Secularization is an altera tion of the forms and conditions of the theological, which is not to say the annihilation of the theological—but neither it is to say the mere repetition of the theological in other guise. While we are fond of saying that history repeats itself, it most brutally does not. And it is precisely history as finite action that makes even the apparent repetition of form in actuality a shift from tragedy to farce, or what have you. As elemen tary as this point is, it is indicative of a profound lapse in the prolifera tion of Schmitt's dictum in the present secularism debates. From this standpoint, although theological elements continue to abound in contemporary societies worldwide, they are neither primary (in some sort of a priori hierarchy of determination) nor have they always existed in strict historical terms—all the more so in relation to the political. As a concept, historically speaking, political theology is a 102 social research</page><page sequence="3">Christian notion (see Thiem 2012). Although the name is first encoun tered in Stoic philosophy, it is given there the significance of one category of politics among many, and by that token, the theological is merely an account of specific elements of service to statecraft. It is only when the Roman Empire refashions itself as a theologically endowed regime under Emperor Constantine that the term begins the trajectory we are now debating. Eusebius of Caesaria (c. 263-340), the first histo rian of Christianity, is also the first to fashion the idea that the trans portation (and transformation) of Roman Imperium to Byzantium is the historico-political actualization of what is theologically announced in the Biblical texts. There is an intricate nexus here, especially the relation of Eusebius's position with the theological arguments about God's Trinitarian consubstantiality that brought about the decisions of the Council of Nicaea (325), which form the theological and legislative foundations of Christianity until the schism in the eleventh centuiy. Especially significant, but not possible to address here, is the famous dictum of Gregory of Nazianzus (329-390) in his Third Theological Oration (379) that the Trinitarian arche? consists in the notion of "the One being in stasis with itself" [to En stasiazon pros eauto]— an extraordinary notion, not only as the epitome of the Christian theo logical imaginary and, altogether explicitly, of how political theology is necessarily monarchical, but also, more broadly, in its equally explicit contradistinction from the ancient Greek philosophical and political vocabulary that enables it to begin with. However, it is in the hands of Augustine, as is well known, that the horizon of political theology is enhanced with a transcendental teleology, the substance of which has yet to be conceptually outmaneuvered. The City of God is still the last instance (telos) of political theology, whatever name might be invented for it in the course of time and the various social-historical languages deployed. Philosophically speaking, the transcendental Civitas Dei is the limit of the concept of political theology, making the political ulti mately subordinate to the theological, an instrument of the theological, as is after all grammatically all too evident: "political" is just an adjec Every Religion Is Idolatry 103</page><page sequence="4">tive to the substantive theology it qualifies. From a historical stand point, however, political theology is to be understood from the outset, long before Carl Schmitt came to exist upon this earth, as theology grounded and constituted against an enemy. This enemy would have to have both theological and political dimensions, although this is not to say that the two are necessarily dialectically entwined. The political history of Christianity is exemplary as a political history of the concept of enmity and has come to infect its historical enemies with the same logic (Anidjar 2003). While the transcendentalist element in political theology is thus outmaneuverable and primary, the usage (or actualiza tion) of political theology in different epochs, including our present time, testifies simultaneously to its insurmountably worldly character. Thinking from the nodal perspective of this naming, two crucial sets of questions emerge. They are of a different order but linked by a demand to focus our interpretation on the political: 1. Is theology necessarily political? That is, can we speak of an apoliti cal theology? And what would this mean? How could "apolitical" possibly stand on its own, undetermined by the political? Moreover, can we really speak of theology as such? Unqualified? Substantial? If the answer is "no" to either of the last two questions then the emphasis on the original question inevitably falls on the issue of necessity. Is theology necessarily political? This, I believe, is the bottom line in the discussion of what might be signified by the name "political theology" and its uses. If indeed this is the case, we need to ask, what are the terms of this necessity? What authorizes it? My tendency would be to say that such terms cannot be merely theological, strictly speaking. That we cannot speak of an internal history of political theology as a formal philosophical concept. In the last instance, political theology is an instrumental logic. 2. What is the politics enacted by political theology? Can we speak of a politics in this paradoxical singular-plural way, that is to say, of a certain kind of politics, an eidos of politics, which can nonethe less be manifested differently according to the historical specifics? 104 social research</page><page sequence="5">All the more so, given that political theology remains articulated unquestionably in the singular—indeed, this begs the question. The question of whether political theology is monological or not is, for me, an outmaneuverable dimension of the problem. We cannot assume an agreement on this issue but neither can we go ahead without seriously encountering it as a question. If in fact political theology enacts a specific politics, regardless of the theological or historical content, then a whole other can of worms is opened. I venture an answer by conviction but also for the sake of argu ment. Schmitt is, again, a crucial reference point. I have always argued that Schmitt's notion of sovereignty as decision on the exception entails a monarchical theory literally speaking, not in reference to royalty. This I hold in spite of his arguments in Verfassungslehre (Constitutional Theory) (1928), which, on the face of it, seems an aberrant text. Its bona fide impetus is a democratic constitutional theory, even if as corrective of the Weimar situation—hence, here too the enemy is liberalism and the metaphysics of representative democracy. Despite stunning statements such as "A democracy must not permit the inevitable factual differ ence between governing and being governed to become a qualitative distinction It is clear that all democratic thinking centers on ideas of immanence [and] the appeal to the will of God contains a moment of undemocratic transcendence.... Under democratic logic, only the will of the people must come into consideration because God cannot appear in the political realm other than as the god of a particular people" and so on, Schmitt ultimately understands the people as a unitary subject that authorizes a unitary figure of the state. Ultimately, a "democratic" Schmitt would argue for the demos as monarch (see Schmitt 2008b, 266-67, and Kalyvas 2009 for an exemplary discussion of this text). Certainly, in Political Theology (1922)—"a purely juridical book" in his words (Schmitt 2008a, 49)—Schmitt conceives sovereignty explicitly as singular arche, and it is elementary to say that the radi cal democratic imaginary that honors Aristotle's dictum that no ruler can rule without the knowledge of being ruled and vice versa—a Every Religion Is Idolatry 105</page><page sequence="6">veritable anarchic position—could not possibly be entertained in the Schmittian universe. But I would go further and argue that this liter ally monarchical element permeates all (post-Hobbesian) theories of sovereignty, including those such as Paul Kahn's that advocating popu lar sovereignty, that see the sovereign position as extra-dimensional of the polity. In this sense, one could paraphrase Schmitt's famous dictum in Political Theology to say instead that all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are residual monarchical concepts. This might give us a better sense of why I assert that political theology has meaning only within a monarchical—that is to say, monological, monomythi cal, and indeed monotheistic—imaginary. Let us remember that Schmitt writes his second Political Theology treatise practically 50 years later (1970) not at all as a sequel, despite the name, but as a response to his critics: primarily to a long essay by Catholic theologian Erik Peterson, written in 1935, on monotheism as a political problem—both the date and the specific focus point to a response to the monarchical dogma of the Fiihrer principle, which Schmitt acknowledges, though not exactly in these words (Schmitt 2008a, 43)—and secondarily to Hans Blumenberg's contemporary critique in The Legitimacy of the Modern Age (1976). But it is actually the second text (Blumenberg) that authorizes Schmitt's impetus to take on the first (Peterson), thereby expressly staging an argument with a theo logian as a political rather than a theological matter. If monotheism is a political problem, according to Peterson, Schmitt seems to suggest that political theology is not about monotheism—a shrewd shift of the framework of argument, very typical of Schmitt's tactics. Hence he predicates his argument on the assertion that "political theology is a polymorphous phenomenon [with] two different sides to it. . . each directed to its specific concepts. This is already given in the compositum of the phrase. There are many political theologies because there are, on the one hand, many different religions and, on the other, many differ ent kinds and methods of doing politics" (2008, 66). One does not suddenly discover a relativist Schmitt, so this passage requires an equally shrewd reading. I don't have the time to 106 social research</page><page sequence="7">conduct it fully here, but I would draw our attention to the central ity of the compositum. I have always found insightful the assessment of the great German playwright Heiner Muller that Schmitt's thinking is exemplarily theatrical. He is a political thinker—for some, the thinker of the political—and, simultaneously, though in a furtive way for many reasons, driven by a theological desire. The two are in constant agonistic relation. The compositum is precisely the staging of this agonism disguis ing a compromise formation. (The reason I use this term will become evident shortly) For Schmitt, political theology, though a concept delineated in the singular (as part of a demonstrable Begriffsgeschichte), becomes by the 1970s text a performative domain, which thereby, by virtue of its very performativity, is articulated as the work of myth. Schmitt explicitly applauds Peterson's suggestion that political theol ogy is a myth, albeit by turning against Peterson's negative signification of the notion of myth. Without invoking Georges Sorel, whose work he knows profoundly, Schmitt essentially adopts here a Sorelian notion of political theology as the myth necessary for the specific socio-historico political action—in his language, essentially juridical—he demands in most of his post-World War II texts. The problem that needs to be inves tigated in depth—and I am just announcing it; I can't do it here—is in what sense this mythical performative, even in Schmitt's staging in Political Theology II, can outmaneuver the transcendentalist imperative of a politics that desires to be theological above and beyond all, a poli tics that, by virtue of this untamable desire, can never be democratic. FOR YEARS I HAVE BEEN FASCINATED BY A COUPLE OF SENTENCES in Cornelius Castoriadis's essay "Institution of Society and Religion" (1980): "Every religion is idolatry—or is not socially effective religion. In religion, words themselves—sacred words—function, and can only function, as idols" (Castoriadis 1997, 325) The unequivocal phrase "every religion is idolatry" comes with an explicit qualification: "or is not socially effective religion"—thereby underscoring religion as a soci etal (indeed, we can easily say political) issue, rather than a theological problem. In this sense, the mysticism that might produce an abyssal Every Religion Is Idolatry 107</page><page sequence="8">language in which no idols remain standing can never be, by defini tion, socially effective, a social binding force. Mystical practice config ures instead a social unbinding, a rejection of society, and aims, at its most extreme, at the incapacity of worldly assembly. This is not to say that the unintelligibility of mystical language is not socially readable— as, after all, Michel de Certeau has inimitably shown. It is to say that, however society might be able to read this unintelligibility, it none theless cannot but turn it into an idol, thereby turn against it, read it as another language, by another language: "The 'mystical' relation to the Abyss, whether it be an 'authentic' or hallucinatory phenomenon, does not matter here: there never was and there never will be mystical religion or a religion of mystics. . . . The 'lives of mystics' themselves function as ... instituted simulacra of the Abyss" (1997, 325). How often "socially effective religion" has turned mysticism into dangerous idol atry (even while bestowing sanctification to specific practitioners) is one of the key indications of how far it goes to deny its own idolatrous investment. Castoriadis's unambiguous signification of religion in this fash ion is actually the result of thinking about representation against the grain of traditional use. For Castoriadis, "the need for religion corre sponds to the refusal on the part of human beings to recognize absolute alterity" (1997, 324). This is primarily an ontological problem (much like it is for Blumenberg), but the question of capacity or incapacity of encounter with alterity is entirely a matter of social-imaginary insti tution. I should clarify, even if absurdly briefly, that, in Castoriadis's language, absolute alterity is an immanent, not transcendental, condi tion. This is expressed in twofold fashion. On the one hand, alterity is literally internal: a radical otherness within a "self" who is forever torn between the compulsion for self-reproduction (identity) and the neces sity for internalizing the resolute otherness of the world (self-altera tion). On the other hand, it is precisely the second: a radical otherness pertinent to the world as a natural substratum, which is immanent because upon it rests every imaginary institution of society even if this imaginary institution is not determined by it. There is no causal rela 108 social research</page><page sequence="9">tion between nature and society, even if without a specific biochemi cal molecular structure human beings would not exist. While the first (psyche) is ontological at the level of the living being, the second (world) is always configured according to the specific social imaginary at work. If this immanent radical otherness exists at the level of physis, both at the psychical and cosmological level, it becomes the reason why, in the world of the human living being at least, physis must be divided by nomos. When this nomos is occluded and presented as physis, this radi cal otherness of self is externalized and fashioned in all kinds of soci etal institutions as transcendental otherness; this is how, on behalf of society, the existential cosmological abyss is overrun by the work of the sacred: "The Sacred is the reified and instituted simulacrum of the Abyss: it endows itself [il se donne] as 'immanent', separate, localized presence of the 'transcendent'" (1997, 325). Responding to this existential predicament, society produces a "compromise formation" that emerges out of the refusal to recognize absolute immanent alterity so as to cover over this refusal, so as to fill its void and in this respect unwittingly to fulfill it. Before the so-called secularization process takes place, this fulfillment of the refusal of abys sal alterity that produces a precisely circumscribed and "socially mean ingful" alterity accounts for what Castoriadis calls religion. Religion is instituted in order to counter the abyssal terrain of being, the fact that there is nothing in human existence that presupposes it, hypostatizes it, or exceeds it; that human existence is at the limit groundless and all established signification fails it. This abyssal condition is, of course, unrepresentable, unrealizable, and meaningless. It may be perhaps intelligible in the desacralized language of psychoanalysis that specu lates—because it can never really know, and Freud said this explicitly— on the abyssal constitution of the psyche, but even there the object is at the core unrepresentable, unrealizable, and meaningless. Castoriadis concludes: Religion covers the Abyss, the Chaos, the Groundlessness that society is for itself; it occults society as self-creation, Every Religion Is Idolatry 109</page><page sequence="10">as source and unmotivated origin of its own institution. Religion negates the radical imaginary and puts in its place a particular imaginary creation. It veils the enigma of the exigency for signification—which makes society as much as it is made by society—insofar as it imputes to society a signification that would come to it from elsewhere (1997, 326). In this respect, to put it bluntly, "society creates itself—and to begin with, creates itself as heteronomous society" (1997, 328; empha sis in original). This utterly paradoxical condition is not open to simple explanation, which is why all pseudosociological or pseudo psychological theories about some sort of structural or hardwired propensity in human beings toward heteronomy are utter nonsense. Surely, such theories never seem to wonder about the epistemologi cal position from which their "investigations" and "explanations" are promulgated. They do not seek to explain why they conduct and achieve a self-understanding that comes from elsewhere and doing so, as conscious self-realization, simultaneously obliterate this very knowledge. Theologians, certainly in the monotheistic traditions, have been performing these sorts of contortions for centuries. The inordinate genius for self-occultation that characterizes some of the most glorious and brilliant manifestations of the theological mind over time testifies to the fact that"the enigma ofheteronomous society and the enigma of religion are, in large part, one and the same enigma" (1997, 329; emphasis in original). One may raise the counterargument that this essentially onto logical signification of religion (because it pertains to a general anthro pology) remains silent about the social-historical emergence of the very concept or name of religion. This name, the counterargument goes, might be said to be inscribed with the secularization claim and all its politics; to wit, the geopolitical establishment of Christianity as the world's dominant religion, which claims to go beyond religion so as to emancipate itself from that constraint while relegating every 110 social research</page><page sequence="11">other such mode to it. For those who make the latter argument—in a broad range of ways, from Marcel Gauchet to Talal Asad, from Tomoko Masuzawa to Gil Anidjar—the question of secularization is in a sense false or deceptive: a ruse by which Christianity erases itself as religion in order to establish the realm of religion for all others. While I think this argument has merit—and in fact a great deal of historical accuracy—it is ultimately shortsighted and indeed compro mised by its unwillingness to consider the essential animating force of what has been called "secularization": namely, the desire of (some) human beings to relieve themselves of their self-imposed constraints and confront the consequences of encountering the cosmological abyss without safeguards. Whether or how far this desire has been realized is not the issue. Secularization, I have been arguing for some years, is unfinishable by definition; the cosmological abyss cannot be encountered once and for all. Although one could again raise the coun terargument that all kinds of other safeguards were indeed put into place—constitutions, nations, ideologies, scientific truths, or Utopian dreams—the fact remains that all those new "delusions" ushered by secularization were acknowledged to be human creations, for better or worse, thereby shifting the knowledge framework so as to enable the thought that "religion" too could be understood as a human creation. Even if secularization can be disputed as having occurred at all—whether according to Schmitt's argument in Political Theology or the work of the thinkers I just mentioned—this shifting in the framework of knowledge cannot be disputed. Regardless of the persistence of the faithful the world 'round, some number among the world's popula tion (indeed impossible to measure precisely) understands that religion is one glorious (if sometimes perilous) human creation among many. Whoever ridicules this simple historical fact as ideology is enshrouded in profound ideological darkness. In the end, what one thinks of secularization is secondary. Religious practices (under different names) seem to have existed in all societies in known history, even if their exact domain of significance is both enormously varied and inordinately contested. As one category Every Religion Is Idolatry 111</page><page sequence="12">of social formation among many (a schema enabled by "seculariza tion"), religion is at this point an epistemological domain in itself. This is to say, it is religion as a categorical—or cognitive—framework that enables the recognition and naming of a certain typology of practices we call religious, and if this distinction is itself a symptom of the secu larization process, it doesn't matter. Or rather, it is a matter of histori cal understanding—of an emergent horizon of perception that enables the recognition of religion as a human creation. Marx's thought contin ues be indispensable here. I quote extensively a well-known passage: The basis of irreligious criticism is: Human beings make reli gion; religion does not make human beings. Religion is the self-consciousness and self-esteem (Selbstgefuhl) of human ity which has either not yet found itself or has already lost itself again. But the human is no abstract being encamped outside the world. The human is the world of humans, state, society. This state, this society, produces religion, an inverted world consciousness, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of that world, its ency clopaedic compendium, its logic in a popular form, its spir itualistic point d'honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, its general ground of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of human essence because human essence has no true reality (Marx 1975,175; emphasis in original). There is no need to elaborate on this exquisite passage, except to point out that what Marx calls "irreligious criticism" is precisely what recognizes humanity's reality to be a concrete manifestation, a poietic creation, of confronting its groundlessness, its abyssal essence. "Human essence has no true reality" he says—no ground other than itself, which is why whatever "it" is, it derives its capacity to be from its phantasmatic propensity to imagine, create, and realize what we call historical realities. That these realities shape or form—and thereby 112 social research</page><page sequence="13">make—specific modes of human-being does not mean that they create humanity in some ontological fashion, no matter the voluminous myths of such creation in all kinds of "cultural" traditions over time. Rather, the myths themselves, in their sublime multiplicity, are perfect instan tiations of the insurmountable groundlessness of human essence. As a human creation, religion is basically a social practice of encountering and concealing the abyss of existence. What Castoriadis calls "socially effective religion"—for him the only meaning of reli gion—is the outcome of creating a name, a representation, a locus for this abyss of interminable self-created otherness. Though such creations are oftentimes concrete material objects (icons, statues, totems, sacred texts), they are equally likely and often more powerfully to be abstract and immaterial (the Word become Flesh, the Trinitarian substance, the unpronounceable Name of God, the 99 names of God, the Unrepresentable, the transcendental Absolute, the Goddess Reason, and so on). Christ himself is called, by Paul, "the image of the invisible God"- eikon tou theou tou aoratou (Col. 1:15). In all cases, such social imagi nary creations that constitute the space of the sacred are idols, reified simulacra of the abyss they represent and at the same time conceal. This is the sense of the statement "eveiy religion is idolatry." To the extent that religion is not merely the representation of society's desire to ritu alize its existence and not restricted to an individual's mystical claim to merge with the abyss, but is instead the institution that occludes the groundlessness of existence as such and thus builds an imaginary insti tutional scaffolding on which society may find rest, then the workings of religion are essentially psychical (by which I do not mean psychologi cal) and indeed not unlike those of sublimation, whereby all invested representations are categorically objectified, be they images, words, or cognitive abstractions. This is why, for Castoriadis, idolatry is at work even in those cases when religion emerges from the foundational monotheistic injunction, the prohibition of images (Bildverbot). Certainly in historical terms, idolatry would not even exist as a concept without this monotheistic injunction: "Idolatry is a word that mainly appears in the discourse of iconoclasm, a militant monotheism Every Religion Is Idolatry 113</page><page sequence="14">obsessed with its own claims to universality. . . . There is no idolatry without an iconoclasm to label it as such, since idolaters almost never call themselves by that name" (Mitchell 2011, 56-73).3 Mitchell adds yet another obvious but crucial historical dimension that is unacknowl edged in theological or philosophical discussions (although Freud makes it explicit in Moses and Monotheism): namely, since the initial Biblical injunction, the iconoclastic prohibition is directly linked to territorial claims, either in terms of exclusionary defensiveness or expansionist conquest, almost always expressing itself with annihilating violence: "the practical enforcement of the ban on images involves destroying the sacred sites of the native inhabitants" (2011, 59). Perhaps because the notion and name of idolatry exists as the hate-filled repressed core of its own prohibition, it is animated, in Mitchell's words, by a surplus, "a moral panic that seems completely in excess of legitimate concerns about something called 'graven images'" (2011, 58) that inspires all out gestures of erasure, a desire to annihilate all traces of peoples and cultures, backward and forward in time—implicitly genocidal (2011, 60).4 Understanding how idolatry works at the heart of iconoclasm is key to unraveling the profound influence of Bildverbot as the most prev alent all-around social command (arche) in today's world. In order to succeed, the exercise of Bildverbot—which conven tionally may have Hebraic origins but remains the core principle in all monotheistic imaginaries, even if performed on extreme occasions (early Christian monophysites, Byzantine iconoclasm, Franciscan or Calvinist asceticism, strict Islamism, or Protestant fundamentalism)— must involve a rather narrow construct of "image" in its most literal sense. Bild essentially comes to define the object of representation as such, as an object that must be identified, known, and forbidden, by virtue of representation, as representation. Nominally, the prohi bition is against images that dare to represent God, if only because they will then be endowed with divine properties in themselves and worshipped as such, as divine objects—idols. But underneath this nominal logic what is really prohibited is the very act, the very conception, of representation, the daring to give God a form, since 114 social research</page><page sequence="15">in the monotheistic imaginary only God forms, or better yet, God is form and the only agency of form, of which humans are thereby the exemplary by-product. This is expressly denoted in the extraordinary notion of humans being formed in God's image and God's likeness—the Greek words translating the Hebrew of Genesis are eikon (image, icon) and homoidsis (sameness, likeness)—a notion that has been always invoked polemi cally against paganism. It can be understood as an explicit rollback of anthropomorphic divinities even as it absorbs the principles of icon and likeness and preserves them, in a Hegelian sense, by altering the core principle: if God is form, then the project of human formation is theo morphic. Yet the human being cannot ultimately tolerate itself as God (or godlike), and so an anthropomorphic notion is projected backward onto the category of God, who may not necessarily look like the statue of Zeus as it would have been sculpted by Praxiteles or Pheidias, but is nonetheless imagined (since the monotheistic imaginary is and can only be a patriarchical imaginary) as the Almighty Father, in however abstract or concrete manifestation of this a specific social-imaginary can handle.5 There is much to say here, in light of this sketch, about the valid ity of Castoriadis's provocative assertion that the institution of religion is "the supreme hubris of human existence, an ontological hubris" (1997, 318). It is provocative because the commonsensical assumption is that hubris is committed when humans believe they are or act like gods, not when they invent or create gods. But indeed, to imagine gods presiding over the universe is one of the most extraordinary acts of human creation, an ordering of the universe by an agency that hereby becomes conspicuously and conveniently absent. It is hubris precisely in the denial of accountability for this act of radical creation (which is, as radical creation, always an act of destruction). Now, to imagine a single God—moreover, a single God who creates humans in image and in likeness—is an even more formidable ontological hubris, if it is at all semantically possible to produce a quan titative figure of the ontological. Not only does it confer the creation Every Religion Is Idolatry 115</page><page sequence="16">(and, of course, meaning) of being to an entity of the imagination, but it also authorizes the very category of Being, which thus leads to the perverse inversion of subject-object authorization whereby the subject deliberately objectifies itself in the most outrageous denial of its own accountability for creation. Worse yet, the object (the created God) is now named Eternal Creator—the ultimate Other, the Object who has become the Subject, the subject without subjectivity who, more over, proceeds with the monopoly of the means of production of the human as the unavowed creator now configured as created (in image and in likeness). This perversely contorted process facilitates outra geous notions of grandeur: not just the concept of the chosen people (absorbed into all, secularized or not, nationalist imaginaries) but the notion that the human, made of/as the face of God, is, in the last instance, of divine essence, a notion whose consequent psychic ener gies, I would argue, belie the worst excesses of both humanist ideology (in its most conventional meaning) and religious fanaticism. This is a stunning performance in the history of the human animal as a living being that renders even the human imagination itself paralyzed before the awe of its achievement.6 In this respect, the prohibition of images has built into it a power ful injunction against both form and representation as such, an injunc tion that seems to resurface with extraordinary urgency whenever the desire of humans to aestheticize their universe seems to gain the upper hand.7 In the process, another big question emerges: What is the rela tion between Bildung and Bildverbot? This is in many ways a German question—crucial to the development of German philosophy, indeed both the theological and anti-theological strains in it—but it is also a question crucial to the imaginary of modernity. It is well known that in the Critique of Judgment Kant equates the Hebraic and Islamic Bildverbot with the sublime. On the other side of this stands the equally well known promise by Nietzsche in The Twilight of the Idols to touch idols with a hammer as if it were a tuning fork. Of course, both thoughts resonate within the same discursive economy. I take Bildverbot to be the core element underlying the Protestant imaginary, which may be 116 social research</page><page sequence="17">distilled into a notion of Geist (spirit) without Bild, not merely Spirit without Image, but spirit that cannot be formed into an image because of an assertion (passed on through theology to modern philosophy) that image ultimately despiritualizes matters. The project of Bildung—at least in the way it was configured in Wilhelm von Humboldt's mind— is a worldly project. Self-formation is a process that creates both the human being and the human world. It is not a spiritual quest, except insofar as spirit (Geist) means also mind, intellect. Freud's Geistigkeit— which may be the only possible redeeming value of Bildverbot within its tradition and this explicitly against the perils of monotheism (which, in the very first pages of Moses and Monotheism, he identifies as the singular cause of religious intolerance and religious violence)—is, of course, a Bildung, a poietic process of forming, of creating form against the prohi bition of form. This process is linked to what Castoriadis has named the radical imagination—that is, the primary social-historical process of enabling the creation of form in advance of those institutions of society charged with reproducing form: "The term radical I use, first, to oppose what I am talking about to the 'secondary' imagination which is either reproductive or simply combinatory (and usually both), and, second, to emphasize the idea that this imagination lies before the distinction between 'real' and 'fictitious.' To put it bluntly: it is because radical imagination exists that 'reality' exists for us—exists tout court—and exists as it exists"; hence, an understanding of the imagination as "the power to represent what is not" opens up a way of reconsidering the relation between image and representation so that the first is not in the service of the second (see Castoriadis 1997a, 321-22). It is not the image as representation but the image as signification that animates idolatry. In this sense then, the modern legacy of Bildverbot would rest on a reconfiguration of Bild, whereby image would be disengaged from the discourse of representation precisely because the order of modernity is structured around an explicit desire to create images that configure the heretofore unseen and unknown, images that conceptualize and signify the heretofore inconceivable "image" that represents nothing Every Religion Is Idolatry 117</page><page sequence="18">that exists prior, the thing that is thereby created into existence. In the imaginary of modernity, the image is not only to be disengaged from the discourse of representation but, more so, engaged from the standpoint of formation and transformation. Hence, the invention of Bildung as nominal repeal of Bildverbot (even if remaining steadfast in its orbit), which foregrounded the power of poietic (trans)formation in the language of aesthetic education. In this process, words themselves are primary imagistic units of signification. The Protestant injunction of sola scriptura, which belongs by definition to the economy of Bildverbot, remains throughout this process one of the most powerful idolatrous gestures in the history of the modern world, reaching beyond the realm of Christianity proper, as it underlies the increasing sacralization of the letter of the law and turns legal texts into the constitutive idols of societies around the world, whether self-identified religious or secular (Douzinas 2000, 813-830). I should clarify here that my account of Bildung exceeds its traditional meaning. In this configuration, Bildung ceases to be a self identical process, whereby the Self comes to fulfill itself—this was Humboldt's idealist vision. Once the concept of the Self is no longer the agent of closure, Bildung becomes the very instance of the force of inter minable self-alteration, recreated through critical self-interrogation as performative pedagogy. Therein resides its democratic element, its participation in the project of autonomy. Democratic paideia conducts itself on the premise and purpose that self-interrogation shatters strict self-referentiality. THE PROHIBITION OF IMAGES IS A RADICAL NOTION ONLY WHEN it operates in a desacralized universe. This was, of course, Freud's aspiration. In a monotheistic imaginary, iconoclasm merely reorients idol worship from the utterable and representable to the unutterable and unrepresentable. The prohibition on pronouncing the name of God is indeed an idolatrous act. Disregarding this fact is a grave error, although indicative of the self-denial inherent in the logic of religious iconoclasm. Making the name sacred circumscribes, in this gesture of 118 social research</page><page sequence="19">erasure, of voiding, the very abyss thus announced. The sacred prohibi tion of the name is a name, an act of naming, of localizing in an imma nent sense, the Abyss that must—and does by virtue of this naming which is the unnaming of the Name—remain shielded. Likewise, the ritual of the Eucharist is not idolatrous in the sense often considered, that is, as a remnant of paganism, in the evocation of animistic eating of the divine body. Rather, the metaphoric configuration of flesh as bread and blood as wine is secondary idolatry, in my mind literally a superflu ous idolatry, a repetitive pleonasm. The most brilliant and insidious gesture this ritual generates is to conceal the real idolatry at work—the conjured phantasm that God, who otherwise cannot be known, who has no name, who exists in ways unfathomable and unrepresentable, can indeed be part of you. In other words, the ritual of ingesting God into one's Being, even if altogether metaphorically, reveals precisely God's idol status, which is his real (that is, actual) status, in this case the status of an idol that claims to destroy all idols—all other idols, would be, of course, the precise way to phrase it. From this standpoint, the Byzantine iconomachy, like all debates about the Trinitarian hypostasis in Early Patristic literature—which after all feeds into iconomachy in the eighth century—is a debate inter nal to the specific idolatry of Christianity. If we take seriously the notion that signification, not representation, resides at the core of idolatrous investment, then the battle between iconolaters and iconoclasts is a bit like Freud's narcissism of petty differences, where the differences are hardly petty because they pertain to the deepest shared inner core, hence the extraordinary violence. This inner core is the ineffable Imago Dei, in its Latin naming, whose representation is in any case impossible by definition, even for the Byzantine iconolaters who had no trouble subscribing, theologically, to the necessary deformation of the divine image in sacred icons, creating the distortion that becomes the distinc tive feature of Byzantine art. These sublime tricks exemplify the work of the sacred in social life, a work that, in the last instance, must remain secretive, literally a mystery. In contrast, a desacralized universe of meaning reconfigures Every Religion Is Idolatry 119</page><page sequence="20">the meaning of both iconoclasm and the sacred. In a capitalist world, where the image is inevitably linked to the rule of commodities and the tyranny of exchange, iconoclasm does become in effect a de-theol ogizing gesture. (Such is the meaning of Adorno's notion of Utopia as negative representation.) It is only then that iconoclasm calls into question the idola tribus as such: the stipulation that in every soci ety there is a last instance that cannot be questioned and, of course, cannot be represented. Whatever the content this last instance may have—whatever language, symbol, sign, convention; whatever may be identified as the "idols of the tribe"—it is society's last instance of the sacred. There is a whole strain in modern art that vehemently sought after this capacity to expose society's last instance of the sacred through an iconoclastic strategy that paradoxically foregrounds or hyper-privileges the image. The Dadaist tradition and the irreverent performativity of Marcel Duchamp come easily to mind. Far from being deconstructive, Duchamp's ready-mades are iconic renamings. They do not bar the image in order to preserve the ideal sacred of an allegedly noncommodified space. Rather, they desacralize the contextual space of the image, for if commodities are extensions of religious idolatry, as Marx argued long ago, they are not so in themselves but insofar as they render sacred their means of existence, the space of capitalist exchange. This was also the impetus behind Situationist performativ ity and Guy Debord's critique of the society of the spectacle. However, Debord's conviction that the spectacle had reached beyond mere visual excess and become objective reality led him into the whirlwind of yet another round of Bildverbot politics, which inevitably propels one to seek yet another space of the sacred, ad infinitum. Much can be learned, in this respect, from the art of Maurizio Cattelan, who, unlike many of his contemporaries, seems especially aware of the deadlock of avant-gardist responses to the commodified image that breed an idolatrous aesthetic sacralization in the name of iconoclasm. It is easy, of course, to characterize Cattelan's notorious irreverence toward the entirety of the art world and its media (agents, 120 social research</page><page sequence="21">galleries, exhibitions, patrons, fellow artists, publications, market publicity, etc.) as iconoclastic. That this can be said without much thinking is itself indicative of the profoundly ingrained and thought less use of the term "iconoclasm." But Cattelan's work, in its shame less irreverence and outrageous provocation (including explicit artistic deception or downright art theft, so much so that many have ques tioned whether he should be considered an artist at all) shows quite the opposite, namely, that it is impossible to exist in a nonimagistic universe and that to presume it is possible is not only a naive illusion but tantamount to the triumph of consumer capitalism's metaphysics of the image, a metaphysics that ultimately denies people's imaginary capacity to think otherwise. Hence Cattelan's commitment to overt proliferation of undisguised simulacra, resin-wax or taxidermic repro ductions of iconic living being. The artist's 2011 retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, with which he announced his retirement from the art world, brought forth this problematic in acute, even dramatic, form. Cattelan chose to exhibit almost every one of his art pieces from over the years (the exhibit is titled "All") by decontextualizing them to an extreme— in full cognizance of the fact that all retrospectives are dependent on decontextualization—that is, by hanging them all from the museum's ceiling with steel cables, in no apparent order, as an assemblage of cadavers in display after a hangman's mass execution, a literal signi fication of the corps of one's artwork as corpse.8 This much could be expected, in retrospect, from an artist whose artwork has consistently strived to showcase its death in order to animate some other (often outrageous, irreverent, or even nonexistent) image of the living envi ronment that enables art to exist at all. But the experience of wind ing up and down the museum's notorious rotunda, in order to get a circular view of this enormous hanging corpse in multiple parts surely aggravates the perilous presumption of artistic iconoclasm for its own sake. Iconoclasm on the gallows may be an apt distillation of what this exhibit was about. Yet what makes this exhibit so radical is that, in strangulating artistic iconoclasm, it also exposes and thus incapaci Every Religion Is Idolatry 121</page><page sequence="22">tates—in a sort of simultaneous double death—the latent idolatrous desire of the presumed secular spectator. The fact that arguably the most iconic of all of Cattelan's repro ductions, exercised against what is conventionally considered the icon against idolatry par excellence—the pope—was received as the most scandalous of all his works should hardly surprise us. His 1999 depic tion of Pope John Paul II in full regalia stricken and incapacitated by a meteorite, titled indicatively La Nona Ora (The Ninth Hour) in a derisory invocation of Christ's moment of death on the cross, was vandalized when exhibited in the pope's native Poland in 2001. It is easy to say that such vandalism signifies the enraged response of the faithful who are responding to the injury of blasphemy—this was as well the consensus around the controversy of cartooning the Prophet Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in 2005.9 We learn nothing by such platitudes. The more difficult thing to engage as a point of inquiry is that such rage is directed against what is perceived as an idolatrous gesture, therefore propelling nominally iconoclastic action, while at the same time, even if unwittingly, expressing the most idolatrous investment in the unrepresentability of the object of worship, which thereby bars it from the realm of art. Such investment is idolatrous in the sense that it is precisely this exclusive mode of worship (latreia) that turns the object of worship into an object that can be seen (eidolon— idol) even when it is not represented. We witness here a perverse logic: self-acknowledged iconoclasts rage against an iconoclasm that they perceive as idolatry while not recognizing that their own idolatrous desire feeds their iconoclasm.10 We can speak of antagonistic idolatries perhaps, though this is admittedly cavalier, because neither the "faith ful" nor the "faithless" recognize idolatry at all.11 It is here that the political workings of the concept of unrepre sentability become crucial. In this respect, much can be appreciated in Jacques Ranciere's argument in The Future of the Image that the image plays in a field between the visible and the sayable. This confirms my argument here, in reading Castoriadis: it is image as signification (not representation) that animates idolatry. Ranciere artfully navigates this 122 social research</page><page sequence="23">terrain in order eventually to raise the stakes on the phantom that haunts the entire discussion: the presumption of the unrepresentable. Even when invoked in the discourse of material history—or perhaps especially there (the unrepresentable event)—the iconoclastic claim to unrepresentability is the apotheosis of idolatrous metaphysics. It is, moreover, a self-annihilating gesture whose internal debilitating contradiction is occluded by the denial of what is a moralistic negation of the sensible, of the untamable desire to configure one's sense of the world—even its abyssal manifestation—in some form (poiein). I quote extensively from Ranciere's passionate conclusion: The assertion of unrepresentabiltity claims that some things can only be represented in a certain type of form, by a type of language appropriate to their exceptional ity. Stricto sensu, this idea is vacuous. It simply expresses a wish: the paradoxical desire that, in the very regime which abolishes the representative suitability of forms to objects, appropriate forms respecting the singularity of the excep tion still exist. Since this desire is contradictory in principle, it can only be realized in an exaggeration which, in order to ensure the fallacious equation between anti-representa tive art and an art of the unrepresentable, places a whole regime of art under the sign of holy terror. ... In order to assert an unrepresentability in art that is commensurate with the unthinlcability of the event, the latter must itself have been rendered entirely thinkable, entirely necessary according to thought. The logic of the unrepresentable can only be sustained by a hyperbole that ends up destroying it (Ranciere 2007,137-138). The obvious—and I think indisputable—point is that nothing is unrepresentable because whatever signifies it as unrepresentable must configure its unrepresentability in some form, even if entirely in the realm of the sayable. But it is more important to understand that nothing Every Religion Is Idolatry 123</page><page sequence="24">is representable or unrepresentable as such. Surely, nothing is unrepre sentable as long as humanity exists; the veiy encounter of humans with the abyss of the world (at least since the time marked by what went on inside the caves of Lascaux) seems to make representation a necessity. But what is curious about the human animal is that the same capacity that seems to make representation a necessity—the psyche's unlimited propensity for fantasy—also propels the demand for the unrepresent able. The phantasmatic commitment to the unrepresentable is animated by the same force that seems to make representation a necessity, the vital propensity that posits no limits as to what can be represented. Once we conceptualize this coincidence and thus deconstruct its alleged paradox, we can understand very well that nothing has ever been beyond humanity's capacity for representation because the noth ing itself has been persistently an object of representation, perhaps the most coveted object of all, the ever-nagging kernel of both philosophi cal and theological thought, whose most forceful renditions have been the inordinate claims to its unrepresentability and the altogether real (and often violent) action to defend the materiality of such claims. NOTES 1. "Alle pragnanten Begriffe der modernen Staatslehre sind sakularisi erte theologische Begriffe." The argument is about structures not ideologies or imaginaries, and this would need to be taken up in a closer reading. 2. It is interesting to think of Schmitt in this regard: "Even the journey into the desert or the climbing of the stylite's pillar can become a political demonstration, depending on the issue" (Schmitt 2008a, 84). 3. Idol anxiety may be precisely the term to describe a whole range of academic discourses on so-called postsecularism these days that consider themselves radical. This collection of essays is a welcome exception. 4. The annihilation of Alexandria's Serapeum in 391 by Christian zeal ots during the reign of Theodosius I, after the imperial ban on pagan religious rites, signified the erasure of centuries of accumulated 124 social research</page><page sequence="25">knowledge and precipitated what, from this standpoint, were rightly called the Dark Ages in the Christian world. More recently, the blow ing up of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban in 2001 recalls uncan nily the dismantling of Greek temples by early Christians, as depicted dramatically (and with great controversy) in a recent film by Costa Gavras, commissioned by the new Acropolis Museum in 2009. 5. Xenophanes of Colophon, writing in the sixth century BC, had enough sense to argue that if bulls, horses, or lions had hands they would draw their gods' form in their likeness, thereby affirming that for humans divinity can only be anthropomorphic because it is a human creation. That he articulates this thought in order to criti cize the anthropomorphic mythology of Homer and Hesiod, being thus the first to suggest that divinity may be precisely what cannot be conceptualized, is the tragic confirmation of the fact that human creation cannot be accepted as creation. 6. I recall Marx again, from the same text. His configuration of the realm of the profane is predicated on precisely this strange phenom enon, the self-incapacitation of humanity by virtue of its awesome capacity to institute superhuman doubles of itself: "Man, who looked for a superhuman being in the fantastic reality of heaven and found nothing there but the reflection of himself, will no longer be disposed to find but the semblance of himself, only an inhuman being, where he seek and must seek his true reality" (Marx-Engels, Collected Works, Vol. 3,175). 7. This is what links the Renaissance with the Reformation to my mind—their antithesis is a dialectical continuation precisely in terms of humanism undoing itself in its name—but also what enables the critique of representation to emerge out of the practice of modern ism, and so on. The exemplary treatment of this whole imaginary nexus remains Vassilis Lambropoulos's The Rise of Eurocentrism: An Anatomy oflnterpretation (1993), which is a remarkable book, in spite of its baroque structure, whose flight under the academic radar is testa ment both to its unorthodox brilliance and the academy's almost requisite tendency to protect its keep. Every Religion Is Idolatry 125</page><page sequence="26">8. The compass to Cattelan's history, which in the end animates this exhibit, is provided by Nancy Spector, chief curator of the Guggenheim Museum, in her Maurizio Cattelan All (Guggenheim Museum Publications 2011). 9. Hence the weaknesses of the arguments regarding the Danish cartoon controversy in Talal Asad's "Free Speech, Blasphemy, and Secular Criticism" and Saba Mahmood's "Religious Reason and Secular Affect: An Incommensurable Divide?" in the volume Is Critique Secular? Blasphemy, Injury, and Free Speech (Berkeley: Townsend Humanities Center, 2009), 20-63 and 64-100, respectively. Both Asad and Mahmood are caught within the moral-legal framework they seek to overcome because they do not confront the fact that the domain of words themselves, whether in the legal texts of secularism or the sacred texts of religion, ultimately functions as a domain of idols. I address these arguments in detail in (Gourgouris 2013). 10. "Idolatry is a form of vandalism that often inspires a violent counter reaction of antipathy to the idol," says the inimitable Judith Thurman, with her penchant for phrasing a complicated thought as if it's mere observation. The phrase occurs in her essay on the photography of Diane Arbus, and is exemplary of how the visual is always psychically authorized, in the sense of how the subject objectifies itself in the process of apprehending (and thus creating) the object. In this case, Arbus, an idol herself, suffers the counter-reacting antipathy of idola try (see Thurman 2007, 55). 11. Hence, there is no possibility that either side can practice what W. J. T. Mitchell has named "critical idolatry"—a kind of respectful or nonviolent iconoclasm, as he calls it, where the idols of the other would be understood to be no less important than one's own.
