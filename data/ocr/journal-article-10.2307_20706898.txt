Los Osos, California: Easter Island Foundation, and Bearsville: Cloud Mountain Press, 1999. xii + 211 pp. bib., figs, glossary, n.p. (paper). MEREDITH WILSON Australian National University Spirit of Place: Petroglyphs of Hawai'i is an impressive book. The authors, Georgia Lee and Edward Stasack, report on ten years of intensive rock art recording on the islands of Hawai'i, Lana'i and Kaho'olawe. Previously, Edward Stasack had teamed-up with J. Halley Cox to produce Hawaiian Petroglyphs (Bishop Museum Press, Honolulu, Hawai'i, 1970) and Georgia Lee had published her exemplary work, The Rock Art of Easter Island: Symbols of Power, Prayer to the Gods (Institute of Archaeology, University of California, Los Angeles, 1992). The most striking outcome of the rock art recording project described in this book is both the amount and detail of work which has been invested into it. Lee, Stasack and their recording team have produced scaled drawings of 31,640 petroglyphs which they have entered into a database, statistically analysed and presented in Chapter 12. In the past, rock art has been accorded a rather marginal status in Pacific research. It is only via such comprehensive recording, analytical and reporting efforts that it will become incorporated into mainstream archaeological inquiry. The authors note that their recording approach involved not only producing accurate documentation and drawing of the petroglyphs found, but also situating them within their natural and cultural environments. It became increasingly evident over the course of the project that Hawai'i's petroglyphs are not randomly located, but set within landscapes which held significance for Hawaiian people in the past. Some sites are specifically located at the interface of two traditional land areas (e.g., at Puako, Hawai'i Island ); others are aligned with traditional walking trails (e.g., Pu'uloa and 'Anaeho'omalu, Hawai'i Island). While not having direct access to the intention of the makers or users of the petroglyphs, it is evident that they are often located in and around areas which held special significance (e.g., Kaunolu's heiau, Lana'i). The book is sub-divided by region. Lee and Stasack draw out subtle differences in the rock art of the various islands. For instance, there is a predominance of dogs among the rock art of Lana'i, sails at Ka'upulehu, footprints at Mo'omomi, and cupules at Pu'uloa. Broadly speaking, however, the authors have observed homogeneity among the petroglyphs of Hawai'i as a whole. While there is some spatial variation between sites, there is little diversity in the overall range of motifs. Lee and Stasack's relative chronology for the rock art is based primarily on a perceived evolution of the anthropomorphic form: simple stick figures, followed by triangular torsos, and finally "muscular" bodied forms. The fact that the latter bear a resemblance to historic wooden sculptures from the island lends further support to their recent antiquity. "Direct" dating on some of the rock art of Kahovolawe Island finds further support for this relative sequence.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 447 Comparisons are also made between the rock art of Hawai'i and that of other Polynesian islands. The authors suggest that while certain design attributes (such as the squatting, profile anthropomorphic form) occur in the rock art of much of Polynesia, there are also very obvious regional differences. The uncanny similarities between the Marquesan and Hawaiian stick figures suggest to Lee and Stasack that the initial colonisers of Hawai 'i set out from the Marquesas. That the stick figure features first in the relative sequence of the art lends much support to this notion. Occasionally statements are made by the authors that come across as being based on intuition rather than secure, or even circumstantial, evidence. For instance, in relation to the site of Kaeo 1 (Puako, Hawai'i), a densely decorated site, the authors write that, "the intensity of activity suggests to us that Kaeo 1 was special, and most likely sacred" (p. 15). Without being told why it is "most likely sacred", this is perhaps overstepping the interpretive potential. The site is clearly located at the boundary between the traditional land divisions of Lalamilo and Waikoloa ahupua 'a, a relationship which is certainly provocative. But can Kaeo 1 actually be described as "sacred" without further insight into its position in indigenous ontology? No ethnographic references to the rock art at this site have been found, which is further reason for caution. Problems such as this occur occasionally in this book. All in all, Spirit of Place is clearly written and well illustrated. The various maps, figures, tables and graphs guide the reader through the text and in general enhance the reader's experience. The various site descriptions are interesting, and will be useful to researchers as well as to visitors who wish to "see" and understand more of the rock art. The authors make various references to the state of preservation of the rock art sites, such as the graffiti at Pala'au on Molaka'i, and the golf course development at 'Anaeho'omalu which has destroyed much of the art there. The recording efforts that are described in this book are critically important given the continuing threat of human and natural devastation to the sites. Ever-impending volcanic eruptions may also one day destroy some of Hawai Ts rock art heritage. The authors' passion for their subject is clearly conveyed throughout the book, and is captured in their own words in the introductory pages: "The petroglyphs of Hawai'i are to be treasured and appreciated? and protected. Walk softly amongst them. Listen to the 'aina (land)" (p.3). I have no hesitation in recommending this book to all interested audiences, and thank the authors for making the petroglyphs of Hawai'i more widely accessible. Such a production should serve as a valuable lesson to researchers, for it is an excellent example of how regional studies of rock art can and should be reported.</page></plain_text>
