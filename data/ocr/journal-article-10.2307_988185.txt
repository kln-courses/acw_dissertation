Stout, "who adapted her designs" from certain of Sullivan's ornamental patterns. These are an unfortunate and embarrassing parody of Sullivan's ornamentation. DAVID GEBHARD University of California, Santa Barbara S. Giedion, The Beginnings of Architecture (vol. II of The Eternal Present) (New York: Pantheon Books, 1964), 583 pp., 372 illus., 18 col. pls., 1 map. $12.50. Bollingen Series xxxv.6.11, The Andrew Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 1951. The coincidence of Dr. Sigfried Giedion's seventieth anniversary in 1964 and the conclusion of his monumental two-volume work, The Eternal Present, offers an incentive to look at the lifework of this extraordinary author. No other art historian now living embodies so clearly as he the gains and dilemmas of the revolution that has torn art history from its academic moorings, because he himself was largely instrumental in bringing about this revolution. Architectural historians have every reason to remember a man who first put mod- ern architecture in all its esthetic and structural aspects on a par with the academically pedigreed historical styles. Even though this evaluation of the present sub specie aeternitatis has not been entirely successful, it established liaison between scholarship and the crea- tive process of building. The historian gained a vital, three-dimen- sional experience and the architect a perspective beyond the exigen- cies of the job in hand. In 1922 Giedion's doctoral thesis appeared under the title Spaetbarock und Romantischer Klassizismus. It proved him a faithful pupil of his teacher, Heinrich Woelfflin, whose Principles of Art History had substituted comparative association of historical style periods for isolated formal characterization. As with all of Woelfflin's attempts to generalize subjective perception into "Grundbegriffe," Giedion's identification of romantic isolation and cellular floor plans remained unconvincing because equal proof could be furnished for space liberation among the romantic classi- cists. The important contribution of his thesis was a first attempt to analyze city planning and architecture as mutually dependent. In 1928 followed Giedion's Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton 1800 bis 1927, which stands as a bold attempt to flee "the Procrustean bed of Woelfflin's theory," as Benjamin Row- land has called it. Undoubtedly inspired by his close friend Le Cor- busier, whose Vers une architecture moderne had appeared four years earlier, Giedion's presentation of the manifold structures in indus- trial materials and technological methods was free of Le Corbusier's highly emotional proselytism. Here was a basic synopticon of en- gineering and design that deserved a much wider distribution. The following thirteen years were devoted to the founding and directing of Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (C.I. A.M.). Its program was included in Giedion's next and most suc- cessful work: Space, Time and Architecture (The Charles Eliot Nor- ton Lectures, 1938-1939; Harvard University Press, 1st edition, Cambridge, 1941). This grandiose panorama of architecture and planning from the conclusion of the Renaissance to the late 1930s, meticulously documented and spiritedly interpreted, filled a total vacuum of contemporary architectural texts. Its success has been stupendous, encouraging every art book publisher who can lay his hands on a stack of free negatives to bring out a history of modern architecture. For teachers in the field the ubiquitous acceptance of Space, Time and Architecture by students as their exclusive source of information on nineteenth- and twentieth-century architecture has been a mixed blessing. In a brilliant introduction, still first class reading for every architectural student and historian, he pledged himself "to recover for his own age its vital relationship with the past." Yet the fighting partisanship of the C.I.A.M. functionalists compelled him to a highly idiosyncratic selection of architects and movements, hostile to any historical continuity. With the statement that "architecture is not exclusively an affair of styles and forms," the umbilical cord to Woelfflin seemed replaced by a new objectivity in which "the infiltration of the personal must be reduced to a minimum." But reasoning from a very Woelfflinian a priori position of science and technology as absolute determinants of architectural function, he condemned to oblivion all architects who did not sub- scribe to C.I.A.M. principles: the liquidation of architecture as "the private concern of specialists and clients;" the solution of local city planning problems according to rigidly standardized uniform meth- ods; the archaic assertion that "contemporary architecture takes its start in a moral problem." Vaudoyer, Gaudi, Berg, Mendelsohn, Nervi, Scherbart and the Glasskette, Scharoun and the November- gruppe were ignored. Giedion's intention "to show in the field of architecture the gap that exists between thought and feeling" was supplemented by a companion volume Mechanization Takes Command (New York, 1948). The introduction emphasized the danger of dehumanization by technology and endeavored "to discern how far mechanization cor- responds and to what extent it contradicts the unalterable laws of human nature." These claims were vitiated by a frankly admiring compilation of gadgets and processes, irrelevant to the basic issue of a mechanized philosophy of society and its menacing mutations in art, architecture, education and warfare, which Giedion carefully failed to mention. This conflict between the scientific camp follower, dazzled by the foolproof laboratory method, and the humanist whose prophetic vision derives from history as the unpredictable and unrepeatable achievement of genius, became even more evident in Giedion's next publication, a listlessly compiled biography of Walter Gropius, who had been the first claimant of absolute historical ignorance: "Mod- ern architecture is not a branch of an old tree but a new growth coming directly from the roots" of scientific teamwork over prima donna design, and of standardization and mechanization of environ- mental assemblage (Walter Gropius-Work and Teamwork, New York, 1954). A collection of essays with a painfully cute and ungrammatical title was Giedion's swan song of the relentless contemporaneousness to which he had pledged himself forty years ago (Architecture, You and Me, Cambridge, 1958). It is shocking and edifying to find how dated even the most brilliant journalistic and lectern pronounce- ments become in less than twenty years if they are merely topical. With the completion of The Eternal Present, two volumes on constancy and change in man's earliest creative expressions, Giedi- on has emerged to everyone's surprise as a reborn historian who has found a new approach to the first principles of his youth. The second volume, entitled The Beginnings of Architecture, which is under review here, is not an easy book to accept. It is a credit to the richness of its contents that the reader is willing to cope to the very conclusion with a confusing lack of continuity, typical for separately composed manuscripts, and with a repetitiveness of statements that is a great virtue in a lecture series but a grave vice in a book. "Eine Rede ist keine Schreibe," say the Germans, to which one might add that book illustrations are not lantern slides which can be thrown on the screen wherever they have to make a point. Scattered throughout 580 pages weighing, thanks to the heaviest available paper stock and the widest blank margins, five solid pounds, an "eternal wandering" after the right picture results in hard physical labor for the reader. The tedium, however, is only a side effect of some very important contributions Giedion has made to the exposi- tion of early architectural history. The most important one is his evaluation of concepts over styles. The first 175 pages (a long road to an ultimate destination) apply "the eggshells of prehistory" concept from the first volume, The</page><page sequence="2">Beginnings of Art, to a comparative analysis of Sumerian and Egyp- tian art. Although this reviewer concedes readily a lack of compe- tence in judging art history on esthetic grounds, there crept back an uneasy memory of Woelfflin's absurd disquisitions on the body and soul of brocade folds in Renaissance and Baroque art when con- fronted with Giedion's characterization of disharmonic Sumerian and serene Egyptian art expression, or his insistence on "the laws of the plane surface," permeating the whole book like a leitmotif, referring to the very people who invented sculpture in the round. When we come to architecture, conceptual categories such as monu- mentality, movement, verticality and space establish a workable framework of analysis for architectural history as a timeless con- tinuity. Not form but the ideological intent that creates the form is of the essence. This works extremely well with a culture as coherent and self-contained as Egypt's and establishes Giedion's volume on architecture as predominantly an Egyptian history. Regardless of whether one agrees with specific conceptual interpretations-and there are many objections, especially in the category of space, such as Giedion's incomprehensible adherence to Riegl's purblind theory of Egyptian "space phobia"-his superb perceptive intuition sees fresh values in overly familiar manifestations. For this one can even forgive him some wild, heuristic assumptions that are contradicted by fact: for instance, the origin of stone architecture not as a region- al expedient but as a vehicle of eternity; his derivation of the ziggurat from the pyramid, all chronological evidence to the con- trary; the liquidation of Egyptian sacred writing or Egyptian as- trology-if they do not fit his theory; and in his finest chapter on Hatchepsut and Deir el Bari, suppression of the fact that Senmut was a good eclectic and did not design anything that had not been said 6oo years earlier by Mantuhotep's architect. That rarest of gifts, enthusiasm, makes everything plausible-almost everything, because one basic and tragic throwback to Woelfflin's comparative style analysis does much to arouse anger and rejection. And this is Giedion's comparison between Mesopotamian and Egyptian art and architecture, in a way like Bannister Fletcher, "on the comparative method". No comparison is possible between the design intentions of commercially motivated, theocratic city states, overrun and hy- bridized for 3,000 years by wave after wave of invaders, resulting in a continuous flux of manifestations of the most heterogenous kind; and an absolutistic-feudalistic monarchy with a purely hierarchic, transcendental intent of expression. Just as it is impossible to do justice to Sumer without mentioning the amazing legal and social implications of the Stadtkrone settlement, so it is impossible to deny in the "serenity" of Egyptian art the frozen calm of castrated in- dividuality. To hold up the primitive survival of the most barbaric animal cults as superior to the brilliant rational anthropomorphism of Sumer is to deny the validity of conceptual over deductive reason- ing which Giedion so promisingly introduces as his guiding prin- ciple. Another contribution of great future importance for the revitali- zation of architectural history is Giedion's break with the Greek bias. He has joined our small unpopular commando to whom "Greek art is not the universal standard against which perfection and less than perfection can be assessed." Although Giedion does not escape completely from the "begotted Greek" heritage, ascrib- ing to Plato space theories that simply are not there, or repeating the cliche that Greek temples are "crystals" in limitless space com- positions (surrounded as they were by the tight column porticoes adapted from Egypt), the very essence of his books is that Egypt and not Greece was the mother of art and architecture. There are assertions, again in the disastrous urge to find juxtapositions be- tween unequals, that read like proofreader slips: "The architecture of Egypt and Greece shares the same space conception," coming only a few hundred pages after a detailed core plan of Karnak with the most unparalleled richness in space variations ever created by man; and "the sculpture of Egypt and Greece is fundamentally 217 different," as if relief, derived from cylinder seals, were an Egyptian contribution, and the idealized archaism of the xxv and xxvI dy- nasties could not be recognized in every Greek sculpture to the end of the sixth century. Yet all of the curious intransigence that flouts historical fact and then calls on a host of academic or archaeological drones for respectability, fades into the background before the radiant joy of a mind that has discovered art as religion. The crowning work of Siegfried Giedion's long, devoted and incredibly industrious search for art-historical truth reads like a declaration of faith in the mission of the historian, engraved, of all places, on the door lintel of the United States Senate: THE PAST IS PROLOGUE.
