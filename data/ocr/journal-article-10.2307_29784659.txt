<plain_text><page sequence="1">An E(e)rie Sound: The Stage Directions in O'Neill's Hughie Laura Shea I on a College IN THE STAGE DIRECTIONS THAT DISTINGUISH HIS WORK, O'Neill Wrote Specific instructions regarding the physical and emotional dimensions of his plays, requirements which leave little?and everything?to the imagination. From the anthropomorphic elms of Desire Under the Elms to the interior mono? logue of the Night Clerk in Hughie, O'Neill challenged his interpreters with the demands of his drama, expecting to see in theatres the same productions that he had seen in his mind. Rarely did they get it right. O'Neill's stage directions are critical to success in the production of his work?success that can be achieved by following the spirit, if not the letter, of what he wrote. In Hughie, in fact, the stage directions really create a drama of their own. Written late in O'Neill's career, Hughie shows the author at his most nov elistic, with stage directions that provide information vital to a complete under? standing of the work and its inhabitants. In a letter of 19 June 1942 to George Jean Nathan, O'Neill described the projected series of plays entitled "By Way of Obit," of which only Hughie survives. In each the main character talks about a person who has died to a person who does little but listen. Via this monologue you get a complete picture of the person who has died?his or her whole life story?but just as complete a picture of the life and character of the narrator. And you also get, by another means?use of stage direc? tions, mostly?an insight into the whole life of the person who does little but listen. These plays are written more to be read than staged, although they could be played (Bogard 531). In third class dump, catering to the catch-as-catch-can trade" (7), "Erie" Smith, a small-time gambler, discourses on the late, lamented Hughie, the previ? ous night clerk, to a resistant audience in the new night clerk, coincidentally</page><page sequence="2">Laura Shea 135 named Charlie Hughes. The seemingly moribund Hughes staves off conversa? tion with a few perfunctory responses; but his conversation with himself, re? served for the stage directions, is alive with possibility. Beyond the specific description of characters and setting, plus detailed instructions to the actors, the stage directions include an ongoing commentary by the Night Clerk, who imag? ines a world he inhabits only in his mind. Prompted by the sounds of the city, the Night Clerk privately dreams of a hospital crisis, a city on fire, a high-stakes poker game. "As his mind tiptoes into the night again" (20), the Night Clerk takes with him information that should not be lost in the transition from page to stage. The play as written comprises two monologues, one exterior and one interior, and the skillful director must decide how best to find a voice for the Night Clerk, whose role, for the most part, is written into the stage directions. Critics have seen in the stage directions in general, and in Hughie in particu? lar, an opportunity to praise O'Neill and to bury him. In The Plays of Eugene O'Neill, John Henry Raleigh considers O'Neill "first as a creator of stage direc? tions" (210), finding that the author has "no difficulty describing natural objects, i.e., his settings," adding that "his stage directions describing human beings are acute, detailed, and psychologically convincing" (211). In the later plays, Ra? leigh notes, O'Neill was "putting almost insuperable burdens on directors and actors, such as ... in finding a way of expressing the interior monologues of the night clerk in Hughie. He was setting down on the printed page what could not be transferred successfully to the stage" (211-212). Raleigh thought the short play "really a short story" (212), agreeing with O'Neill's assessment that it "could not be given a conventional stage production" (212). But he praised its literary merits: "the stage directions through the play, describing states of mind and appearances of the characters, possess a genuine literary distinction and dem? onstrate that in his final, agonizing days O'Neill had achieved almost perfect control over what had always baulked him: words" (213). In O'Neills Scenic Images, Timo Tiusanen applauds the author's general use of the stage: O'Neill "rarely fumbled with sound effects or descriptions of the outer appearance and behavior of his characters.... In the stage directions for the actors he was both willing and able to take great responsibilities: his eye was as sharp as his ear" (53). Writing of Hughie, Tiusanen observes, "An important section of the play is written into its stage directions; it is simply impossible for any actor to draw a picture of the clerk's unmasked face with the help of silent acting alone" (320). Again, the critic anticipates theatrical failure: "As a rule, O'Neill proceeded further toward the solution of staging problems than most playwrights; this time, he created a problem instead" (320). Tiusanen places Hughie "closer to a short story than to an actable drama in the miniature" (320), directing the play to the radio, where "part of the important stage directions could be read by a speaker, while the clerk could voice his own speeches placed in the directions" (320).</page><page sequence="3">136 The Eugene O'Neill Review O'Neill's stage directions have been criticized by such earlier assessors as playwright Virgil Geddes, who found that they "invite antagonism more than they spur imagination" (The Mehdramadness of Eugene O'NeUl 8). According to Geddes, O'Neill attempted to circumvent the stage by playing directly to the reading audience, relying on "writing which never shows on the stage" ("Eu? gene O'Neill" 944). Unlike Geddes, Tiusanen finds that the stage directions "serve their purpose and give testimony to the fact that the idea of the stage was actively and continuously present in O'Neill's mind during the process of writ? ing" (39-40). In A Drama of Souk, Egil T?rnqvist, like Tiusanen, considers the importance of the stage directions to all those who read the lines: "Since [O'Neill] never published any of the original acting versions, we must assume that he meant the published plays to function not merely as reading matter but also as texts for future productions. And even of the passages that seem directed to the general reader we cannot feel sure that they are not meant as much for the actor and director" (27). T?rnqvist sees the purpose of the stage directions as twofold: "[O'Neill] is explaining the significance of the characters' actions to the reader to help him do a better production in his mind. And he is providing 'road signs for the intelli? gent actor' to help him do a better production for the spectator. To what extent we consider stage directions ... primarily meant for the general reader or for the actor and thus, indirectly, for the spectator, depends on the extent to which we consider them realizable in the theatre" (27). In considering the stage directions as "road signs for the intelligent actor," T?rnqvist is quoting the Gelbs in their biography of O'Neill (325) and anticipating the argument of Jeffrey Elliott Sands in "O'Neill's Stage Directions." Sands insists that O'Neill was a man of the theatre and that the stage directions should be read as instructions to the actors, considered in terms of their practical, rather than literary, application: "[O'Neill's] dependence on the stage directions to ensure that the actors carried out?or at least understood?his intentions gives further evidence for the idea that O'Neill, perhaps more than any other modern playwright, could not separate the act of writing from the idea of performance" (203). Marcelline Krafchick, like Sands, identifies O'Neill as "entirely a theatre person" (51); she finds that O'Neill "conceived images for the stage no matter how wildly untranslatable they seemed at the time, even to him" (51). In "Film and Fiction in O'Neill's Hughie" Krafchick considers the cinematic possibilities in the stage directions, arguing that "although O'Neill's acrimony toward Holly? wood made him indifferent to Hughie's staging with film and sound track, he had nevertheless found through that technology the novelist's freedom he coveted to disclose inner reality" (48). With or without the Night Clerk's thoughts voiced in the stage directions, Krafchick sees Hughie as an entirely playable theatre piece: "A production that disclosed the night clerk's thoughts would help the</page><page sequence="4">Laura Shea 137 audience to interpret particular information that makes the play stronger and more complex" (53). Doris Alexander, in "The Missing Half of Hughie" agrees with those who find the Night Clerk's visions "impossible to stage" (126), though she too finds that "these thoughts would make interesting film montage" (126). To enhance the "post-modernist aura" that she believes is at the heart of the play, Susan Harris Smith suggests that the Night Clerk's interior monologue "should be separate from the actor playing the Night Clerk. The obvious solu? tion would be a taped reading of the lines played through the theatre's sound system.... The dramatization of such a conversation without communicative effect would reflect not only the aesthetics of silence but also the metatheatricality of role-playing born of desperation" (126). O'Neill's solution to staging the play was more ambivalent. According to biographer Louis Sheaflfer, "Anticipating the mixed-media theatre of later de? cades, the visionary playwright told Carlotta that ideally the playlet should be produced with a sound track for the interior monologues and stage directions that would accompany the live dialogue, in addition to a background film of the city" (523). As the Gelbs report, the playwright "did not pursue the idea. He shrugged off the problem, saying:' It would require tremendous imagination. Let whoever does it figure it out. I wouldn't want to be around to see it'" (844). The play, which was not staged during O'Neill's lifetime, premiered in 1958 at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Stockholm. The production left the Night Clerk's thoughts unvoiced, although the 1964 American premiere and Broadway pro? duction at the Royale Theatre, directed by Jose Quintero, with Jason Robards as Erie Smith, allowed the Night Clerk to speak his mind in the manner of the "thought asides" of Strange Interlude. In the Quintero-directed production of Hughie, filmed for television in 1984, the Night Clerk, played by Jack Dodson, voices the fragments of his interior life, while Robards, as Erie, goes about his business, unaware that his conversational partner is living an imaginary life as exciting as the one Erie created for himself and for Hughie's benefit. Erie had regaled the late Hughie with tales of the life of a high roller: though Erie knew better, Hughie's belief in Erie as a Broadway sport "didn't cost nobody nothin'" (29) and helped the struggling gambler, who seems to have buried what little luck he had with Hughie. While "[paying] tribute ... to the memory of brave days that were and that never were" (29), Erie tries to make a connection with the new night clerk, who is unavailable for comment: His mind has hopped an ambulance clanging down Sixth, and is asking without curiosity: "Will he die, Doctor, or isn't he lucky?" "I'm afraid not, but he'll have to be absolutely quiet for months and months." "With a pretty nurse taking care of him?" "Probably not pretty. "(26)</page><page sequence="5">138 The Eugene O'Neill Review In Hughie, the stage directions offer everything from social commentary in O'Neill's description of the hotel?"The Everlasting Opulence of the New Eco? nomic Law has overlooked if (7)?to physical detail, "[Erie's] false poker face as nakedly forlorn as an organ grinders monkeys" (31), and a Sartrean view of hell as another person: The Clerks face is taut with vacancy. His mind has been trying to fasten itself to some noise in the night, but a rare and threatening pause of silence has fallen on the city, and here he is, chained behind a hotel desk forever, awake when everyone else in the world is asleep, except Room 492, and he wont go to bed, he's still talking, and there is no escape. (29) Viewers can read a lot into a performance, but it is unlikely that they will know from the Night Clerk's dour expression, even from the most accomplished silent acting, that "the Clerk's face would express despair, but the last time he was able to feel despair was back around World War days when the cost of living got so high and he was out of a job for three months" (17). Nor will they know when the Night Clerk, in his mind, "escapes to the street again to play bouncing cans with the garbage men" (18) or rides the fire truck to a raging inferno. In Hughie, two sets of pipe dreams vie for attention. Without a clear indication of the fantasy life of the Night Clerk, the play becomes a single monologue with a few interruptions by a mostly silent listener, who is essentially part of the furni? ture. Something is left, to be sure, but something vital is lost. Recently, a novel approach to the play allowed the Night Clerk again to be heard. After a workshop production several years earlier at Circle in the Square (Downtown), and a pre-Broadway engagement at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, plus a lengthy preview period on Broadway, Hughie opened at the Circle in the Square (Uptown). Directed by Al Pacino, with Mr. Pacino as Erie Smith and Paul Benedict as the Night Clerk, the production ran from July 1996 to October of the same year. According to Vincent Canby in The New York Times, "In this production Charlie is not quite as taciturn as O'Neill wrote him. The inner thoughts O'Neill gave him in the stage directions are now spoken by Mr. Benedict as soft asides, heard as if through an echo chamber. They're initially jarring, sounding a bit like sci-fi sound effects that have little to do with 1928. Yet they also allow the written character to be more fully understood onstage" (C20). In the Pacino-directed production, the amplified lines of the Night Clerk's interior monologue were clearly separate from the spoken lines that Erie hears. In review? ing the production for TheaterWeek, Alexis Greene adds, "O'Neill wrote descrip? tive directions for the clerk's unvoiced thoughts, and here these thoughts are</page><page sequence="6">Laura Shea 139 spoken, and miked so they echo lonesomely" (12). In the spirit of collaboration for which the theatre is justly famous, Theodore Mann, a producer of Hughie in both 1964 and 1996, stated in an article announcing his resignation after 45 years as artistic director of Circle in the Square, that "while giving the artistic credit to Mr. Pacino, who is the director as well as the star of the play,... it was his idea to use the inner thoughts of the hotel clerk as a kind of voice-over" (Gussow 24). (Mr. Pacino made no comment.) Whatever the provenance, the effect was eerie, amplifying not only the interiority of the Night Clerk's monologue but also the isolation of living inside one's head. The Night Clerk engages in a real conversa? tion only when the outward silence begins to echo inside him: Outside, the spell of abnormal quiet presses suffocatingly upon the street, enters the deserted, dirty lobby. The Night Clerks mind cow? ers away from it. (31) With no street sounds to divert him, the Night Clerk fastens on something the guest in Room 492 had said about gambling, which launches one of his longest reflections, his mind "suddenly impervious to the threat of Night and Silence as he pursues an ideal of fame and glory within itself called Arnold Rothstein" (32), thinking, "Fd raise him five grand, and he'd call, and Td have a royal flush to his four aces" (32). The Night Clerk's dream of beating Arnold Rothstein at his own game coincides with what Erie thinks is the end of his dream, fearfully admitting that the loss of Hughie meant the loss of the "old confidence" (35). Missing Hughie, Erie almost misses the fact that he has con? nected with the Night Clerk and that Arnold Rothstein is the point of intersec? tion. The Night Clerk's eagerness to believe that Erie is an old friend of the famous gambler is equalled by Erie's desire to play this role for the Night Clerk, who also takes on a new part: now he is Hughie too. Flush from his imagined triumph against Arnold Rothstein, the Night Clerk agrees to roll the dice with Erie, playing the sucker to Erie's wise guy. As the Night Clerk succumbs to the gambler's winning ways, "[Erie's] soul is purged of grief his confidence re? stored" (38). Within a shared fantasy, the Broadway sport and his buddy score a victory over "the threat of Night and Silence" (32), the dream having won out over reality. The need to dream is central to the thematic concerns of Hughie and is essential as well to its theatrical context. In the play, the need to share in the imagination of another provides the means of evading the reality of loss and isolation. In the theatre, this need is echoed in the treatment of the Night Clerk's dreams, spoken in interior monologue. If the Night Clerk keeps his thoughts to himself, indulging in untold possibilities, a view worthy of mention is lost to the audience. Whether read as instructions to the actors or instructions for the ages,</page><page sequence="7">140 The Eugene O'Neill Review O'Neill's stage directions need the dreamer's touch to realize the playwright's vision. A creative solution to staging the play in the imaginative application of the stage directions can result in a production that bows to applause, not to convention. WORKS CITED Alexander, Doris.
