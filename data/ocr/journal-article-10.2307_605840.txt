<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.2 (1994) itself contributes nothing toward an increased appreciation or understanding of the piece. So enigmatic is this figurine that the authors themselves beg the issue of its significance by rhe- torically asking what this image represents; in response, they offer no definitive reply. Clearly, the image alone, without a supporting text or inscription, does not inform the percipient about its theme. Since this is the case, it becomes difficult to accept the premise that masterpieces of art alone reveal more about Egyptian civilization than do inscriptions. Text and im- age must be considered together as do, for example, M. Mal- aise in interpreting a complex group of figures in bronze depicting the child god Harpocrates in the company of several beasts and a vessel, and J. Quaegebeur in dealing with the pharaonic aspects of Nemesis. In both these cases, the objects discussed are not inscribed, but a careful reading of related textual material from other contexts provided the framework within which each of these objects could be better understood. There are some interesting internal inconsistencies, as well. In dealing with ancient Egyptian metal statuettes, one is habit- ually perplexed by the apparent lack of correspondence between the deities represented by the figures and those mentioned in the accompanying inscriptions. Two examples in this catalogue will illustrate the problem. The first is a bronze group representing an anthropomorphic crocodile-headed figure and a kneeling male worshipper (cat. 17); these have been placed on a base, the inscriptions around which mention the god Amun-Re. As a re- sult, the authors accept the inscription at face value as referring to the deity in this group and suggest that the god Amun can be represented as a crocodile. On the other hand, a silver statuette of a figure which is traditionally identified as the god Nefertum bears an inscription on the bottom of its base naming only one deity, the goddess Isis (cat. 90). Is one, therefore, to apply the same line of reasoning and identify this figure with that god- dess? The authors pass over this sticky situation in a somewhat perfunctory manner, although the problem presented by these two inscriptions are crucial for an understanding of how such in- scribed metal statuettes are to be regarded. One should have at least raised the issue of this variance between image and text. Josef Riederer's appendix, an analysis of the metals used in the bronze statuettes, is interesting, but, unfortunately, is not in- corporated into the descriptions of the individual entries. So, for example, the royal head, which is the last object in the cat- alogue (cat. 143), is there described as "bronze" and bears a very different number from its entries on pages 224-25 (no. 48) where the piece appears to be made of almost pure copper (95.34%). Such lapses are disturbing, to say the least. The catalogue is, of course, lavishly produced and attrac- tive; each of the objects is illustrated by at least one view, often in color. The anonymous collector's taste gravitated to- ward the miniature in faience and toward an array of wonder- ful bronzes from the inevitable Khonsu and Osiris to the ka with its offerings and spear of Horus. He was attracted to rare materials, such as quartzite heads from the late Eighteenth Dynasty, green porphyry (chlorite?) head of a child-god, "ophikalzit" (sic) (malachite?) torso of a female figure, rock crystal frog, lapis lazuli Maat, bone Nechbet, and royal heads, one of obsidian and a second of haematite. As one flips through the pages of the catalogue, one's eye is continually arrested by one or another of the images of these striking objects. It is all the more regrettable, therefore, that ob- jects assembled by this collector, possessed as he is of a par- ticular aesthetic predilection, were pressed into the service of a provocative academic premise which was, unfortunately, never fully argued at length in the pages of the catalogue. The authors have, nevertheless, challenged us to think about the issue of quality and to ponder the role of the masterpiece within the dis- cipline of Egyptology.

Since 1980, Spanish and German archaeologists have trans- formed our knowledge of Phoenician and Carthaginian archae- ology in Spain, making it clear that a Semitic cultural presence was established by 800 B.C. in Andalusia, and that it exercised a 274</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books profound influence on the autochthonous peoples. Fruits of this interaction were the Tartessian and Iberian civilizations, estab- lished by 600-550 B.C., and which flourished for three centuries. Professor Jose Maria Blazquez is a prominent investigator in this field, known as an ancient historian and textual com- mentator, as well as the excavator of the city of Castulo on the middle reaches of the Guadalquivir River. He has long de- fended the importance of the Semitic contribution to western Mediterranean cultures and has correctly insisted that it can- not be marginalised. This book gathers together twenty-six of his published essays, twenty-three of them since 1982. They are grouped thematically and chronologically, accompanied by big, modern bibliographies, and explicitly intended for the convenience of students. The illustrations are few and small. As a tool for students, this compilation is sensible; but the bibliographies are repetitive and indiscriminate, making it hard to know which are the important primary sources. The decision to include few visual aids hinders the narrative that relies heavily on the readers' knowledge of Iberian and Medi- terranean topography. The essays are mainly on the Phoenician presence in the far west (439 out of 541 pages of text). The opening essay dates from 1983 and is an overview that includes materials published up to 1980. The next three concern the dating of engraved stelas of warrior graves in the southwest. Other essays discuss orien- talizing ceramic sequences, or impart a summary on such diverse subjects as cult spaces at Castulo, carved ivories from Cancho Roano, and the Greek element in the sculptures from Porcuna (Obulco). Historical themes figure too: the Greek origin of the Geryon myth, the Carthaginian Empire in Spain, and Cartha- ginian mining in Spain. Uniting all these studies is a normative, positive view of ancient history and archaeology. Texts are privileged over ar- chaeological data, which are taken at face value, and gaps in the text-based history are filled in with artifacts, without re- solving the incongruities that result. The end product is a vi- sion of the Semitic west that is not so much unsympathetic as unimaginative. The approach is historically conservative and linguistic. While this can be defended, it is achieved at the price of relegating the anthropological insights that enrich our understanding of Etruria and Greece. In fact, Phoenician- Carthaginian trade can be seen as a cultural process expressed as successive modes: from diplomatic trade to entrepots to emporia. The classical texts do not clarify this, but anthropo- logical models certainly do. Other writers address the materi- als differently, and their revisions of Carthaginian Spain and the Iberian cultures will be awaited with interest. RICHARD J. HARRISON UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL Jewish Lore in Manichaean Cosmogony: Studies in the Book of Giants Traditions. By JOHN C. REEVES. Monographs of the Hebrew Union College, no. 14. Cincinnati: HEBREW UNION COLLEGE PRESS, 1992. Pp. xi + 260. $49.95. Well before the major modern discoveries of Manichaean manuscripts, the 18th-century French Huguenot scholar Isaac de Beausobre conjectured that the Manichaean "Book of Gi- ants" was somehow related to a Jewish apocalypse known as the Book of Enoch (Histoire critique de Manichee et du Manicheisme [Amsterdam: J. F. Bernard, 1734-39], 1:430). Among other things, Enoch described the fall of an exalted class of angels (the "Watchers") and their begetting of a giant offspring from the "daughters of men." Although not initially greeted with much enthusiasm, de Beausobre's theory was later vindicated by W. B. Henning's publication of the fragments of the "Book of Giants" found among the Turfan Manichaean manuscripts ("The Book of the Giants," Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 11 [1943]: 52-74]). Henning immediately recognized that the basic narrative of the work was an elaboration of the "Book of Watchers," one of the books comprising the Book of Enoch. Apparently, Mani had interpreted the fallen watchers as rebellious demons who had escaped from heaven and produced a race of "giants" and "abortions." As momentous a find as the Turfan texts was J. T. Milik's pub- lication of the Qumran fragments of the Book of Enoch (The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4 [Oxford: Clarendon, 1976]). Although none of the later Christianized versions of the work knew of a "Book of Giants," Milik proved that the original Aramaic version of Enoch did include the very work that the Manichees were later to include in their canon of sacred texts. All of the pieces of this improbable story had now fallen into place. The remaining task facing Manichaean studies was to establish how Mani succeeded in incorporating narra- tive from a Jewish apocalypse into his own religious system. Reeves' study is a welcome contribution to this subject. After a survey of the scattered witnesses to the "Book of Gi- ants," the second chapter of Reeves' work offers a transliteration and analysis of the Qumran fragments of the "Book of Giants." He subjects Milik's restorations to a fresh analysis, suggests his own narrative ordering of the fragments, provides new transla- tions, and includes, where relevant, parallel material from the Manichaean versions of the work published by Henning and W. Sundermann (Mittelpersische und parthische kosmogonische und Parabeltexte der Manichaer [Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1973]). In chapter 3, the author examines another possible source for the "Book of Giants," the excerpts from a Man- ichaean work preserved in a homily of Severus of Antioch. In opposition to F. Cumont and M.-A. Kugener (Recherches sur le manicheisme [Brussels: Lamertin, 1908-12], 83-172), Reeves contends that the contents of Severus' excerpts do not tally at all 275</page></plain_text>
