<plain_text><page sequence="1">Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology: The Question of Focalization Kai Mikkonen ABSTRACT This essay discusses three premises of focalization theory and narrative perspective that bear particular relevance to the question of narrative mediation in visual storytelling, specifical ly in regard to graphic narratives. These questions include the fundamental distinctions between 'who speaks' and 'who sees,' between the source and the degree of focalization and the entity fo calized, and between personal and impersonal vantage points. Inspired by recent developments in focalization theory and transmedial narratology, the essay emphasizes the importance of medium-specific features in graphic storytelling and perspective-taking and ponders the narra tological problems that these features create. Designating the degree of deixis in graphic images on the visual level is exceedingly difficult; moreover, many types of focalization in graphic nar ratives do not fall as easily within the external/internal divide as in literary narratives. In order to develop a truly transmedial concept of focalization, it is important for narrative theory not only to find common ground between different narrative media in respect to their techniques and processes of perspective-taking, but also to develop ways to explain the fundamental differ ences between verbal and visual focalization or among different varieties of pictorial narration. Graphic narratives present a specific challenge to transmedial narratology, as the medium re quires that the reader integrate perceptual information from different semiotic channels in ways that are both similar to, and different from, other forms of multimodal narration. Introduction There has been a strong trend in so-called postclassical narratology to empha size embodied perception as a fundamental cognitive frame in understanding any narrative. This shift in emphasis has resulted in theoretical reassessments of the question of narrative mediation, including the concept of focalization. Amongst these revisions, Monika Fludernik's subordination of perceptional parameters in a narrative—or the perceptual metaphor—to the question of the presentation of con sciousness has perhaps been the most influential approach. In Towards a 'Natural' Narratology, Fludernik argues that the category of focalization is, to a very large extent, an interpretive one, and "not exclusively a textual category" (345). That is to say, it involves the reader's postulation of a focalizer figure that is determined by the processing of specific textual clues, such as deictic and expressive markers, modality, and tense. The person who "sees," she points out, "is the reader, but à travers the linguistic medium, and not in terms of visual perception" (345). Such recent theories of focalization have consequences for any transmedial understanding of narrative mediation since these formulations typically take into account particular features of other narrative media, such as film narration, as</page><page sequence="2">638 Kai Mikkonen distinct from the perceptual metaphors and frames used in literary narratives.1 At the same time, these approaches have made an important contribution to lit erary studies by increasing our understanding of the similarities and differences between different narrative media. In comics studies, narratological approaches to perspective, or other elements of the narrative situation, have not yet been widely applied or tested, even if narratology has informed the work of a number of comics theorists and historians, including, for instance, Thierry Groensteen, Ann Miller, and Jan Baetens, while some prominent narratologists such as David Herman have started to make significant contributions to the field.2 To generalize somewhat, the main theoretical trends in comics research, in Europe as in North America, have been semiotic approaches that are interested in meaning-making processes, aesthetic approaches involved in the description of the key formal fea tures and devices in the medium, as well as various social, political, economic and cultural questions related to comics. In what follows, I will structure my discus sion around three major questions derived from recent narratological reformula tions of focalization (i. e., perspective-taking) in relation to medium-specific fea tures of graphic narratives and comics. These questions include the fundamental distinctions between 'who speaks' and 'who sees,' the source of focalization and the entity focalized (i. e., Mieke Bal's "focalizer"), and personal and impersonal vantage points. I. 'Who Speaks,' 'Who Sees,' and 'What Is Shown' Comics are particularly suited for the analysis of multimodal narration, and potentially highly important in the development of transmedial narratology, as our understanding of them depends on inferences about the relationship between verbal and visual elements and resources as well as on visual and verbal com binations such as onomatopoetic signs and speech and thought bubbles. In the multimodal narrative environment of this medium, the classical narratological distinction into voice and focalization must be modified for at least two reasons.3 1 See, for instance, Bal, Narratology, Altman. 2 One of the first English-language narratological approaches to comics was Abbott. Groen steen uses some narratological notions and narratology-informed theories (Gérard Genette, François Jost, Tzvetan Todorov, André Gaudreault) in his 'neo-semiotic' approach to comics theory in Système de la bande dessinée (1999; published as The System of Comics by the UP of Mississippi in 2007). In the second part to his 'system,' Bande dessinée et narration (2011), and in particular in a chapter on the concept of the narrator in comics, Groensteen takes issue with the question of narrative enunciation in a way that relates directly to the present study and Mik konen, "Presenting." A recent special issue of SubStance (2011), which brings together a number of American and European narratologists and comics scholars from David Herman and Jared Gardner to Pascal Lefèvre and Jan Baetens, makes an important contribution to the exploration of emerging connections between comics studies and narrative theory. See also Miller 103-24. 3 Multimodality (and the derivative 'multimodal text') means the interdependence of se miotic resources (or 'modes'), such as images, language, or sound, in text. See, for instance, Stöckl. Multimodal research is usually inspired by systemic-functional linguistics and the ground-breaking work of Kress and van Leeuwen on the grammar of visual design. Cartoons</page><page sequence="3">Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology 639 On the one hand, the question of 'who sees,' or, as Gérard Genette reformulated the question, "where is the focus of perception?" (64), is relevant on two different modal levels simultaneously, both in words and in images. On the other hand, the question of 'who speaks' is relevant in relation to the verbal track of narration, but that relationship must also be reconciled with the visual track of informa tion. In the two-track medium of comics, the formal markers of perspectival fil tering, therefore, are necessarily both verbal (metaphorical) and visual (literal) clues that require the reader to integrate perceptual information from different semiotic channels in a meaningful way, for instance, in terms of complementary functions or contrast. The question of cross-referencing, or interplay, between vi sual and verbal information thus conditions the distinction between focalization and narration. To the question "where is the focus of perception?" we may further want to add the question 'what is shown?' so as to underscore the importance of visual presentation. Here we could also refer to a kind of universal 'grammar' of pictorial narration where visual showing is essential in narration, that is, to the importance of showing (versus telling about visual perception) across various vi sual narrative media from picture books to films and from comics to photo essays. Fludernik's claim about the perception of reality in films, put forward in An Introduction to Narratology (2009), points to a fundamental difference between verbal and visual ways of encoding narrative perspective—beyond particular nar rative techniques that may or may not be employed across media. This involves the question of epistemic access to narrative mediation, including knowledge of both the point of perception and what is perceived. Recent debates over narrative agency in film narratives offer us additional concrete means by which to concep tualize such a fundamental difference between verbal and visual focalization. The basic idea is that film images give us a view into a space from some more or less determined perspective and that films, in fact, cannot avoid doing so. At the same time, visual or multimodal narratives can employ a wide range of visual tech niques as means of focalization, including, for instance, techniques that may be associated with stylistic features in literary narratives but that finally do not have exact equivalents in literary discourse. In David Mazzucchelli's highly ambitious graphic novel Asterios Polyp, for example, every character is given an individual visual style, lettering, dominant color scheme, and word/thought balloon format, and therefore all these techniques also become means of focalization.4 Another important feature of perspective in some of the panels in Asterios Polyp, and one that would be difficult to realize in the moving images of a film, is the way in which the different frames overlap in a passage that relates the main character Asterios's and his girlfriend Hana's meeting with the composer Kalvin Kohoutek. The overlapping frames of this passage create a sense of a continuing and comics are sometimes seen as prototypical multimodal texts in this context, as in Baldry and Thibault. Baldry and Thibault's model of multimodality, however, does not show any knowledge of standard concepts in comics or film studies. 4 Mazzucchelli is an American cartoonist and comic book writer who has previously worked in the superhero genre, including the four-issue story Batman: Year One (1987, in collaboration with Frank Miller), and alternative comics, and he has done a graphic adaptation of Paul Aus ter's novel City of Glass (1994).</page><page sequence="4">640 Kai Mikkonen space, while they also divide the space into individual areas (the varying colors in the panels further sharpen that distinction). The 'polyphony' of these panels does not concern spatio-temporal transitions between images as in the cinematic technique of the dissolve. And, moreover, the overlapping panels may be taken as an illustration of the themes of simultaneity and polyphonic experience that are discussed by the characters in the panels. The split screen device in films may cre ate similar effects of simultaneous events or disruptions of space, but the stress in Asterios Polyp is on spatial simultaneity and ambivalent spatial relations. There is no split screen. The speech bubbles equally enjoy spatial freedom from any screen structure, being both juxtaposed on the images and located outside the panel frames. The spatial organization of the panel sequence and the page, as well as the distinct visual styles that are attributed to individual characters, highlight the importance of the questions 'what is shown?' and 'how is something shown?' in the space of the image. Still another means by which comics can achieve a sense of various simul taneous perspectives, and do it differently from techniques of focalization that are used in films or literature, are words that have an ambivalent relation to the space and contents of the image. Typically, first-person graphic narratives create a meaningful contrast between the narrative "voiceover" and the narrator who is seen in the image from the outside. While narration in comics often offers a clari fying perspective on the contents of the image, indicating what is important and salient in the things that are seen, the words may also maintain an ambivalent re lation to the space of the image. The graphic manipulation of the textual element is taken to new heights in Chris Ware's work, particularly in his graphic novel Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth (2000). Here the graphic nature of the text, and more precisely, the careful attention to the placement, shape, and color of the graphic words and letters, functions as a form of perspective-taking, for instance when the narrator's discourse appears as if it were literally placed on the surrounding walls and surfaces.5 The views that emphasize medium-specificity in film studies would seem to coincide with Gérard Genette's famous remark in Narrative Discourse Revisited that, unlike the movie director, "the novelist is not compelled to put his camera somewhere, he has no camera" (73). Genette's conclusion, which disagrees with those versions of postclassical narratology or 'psychonarratology' that emphasize not only the importance but the necessity of spatio-temporal positioning in all narratives, is that focalization, in the sense of the narrative representing a center of perception, is only an option in literary narratives.6 For Genette, focalization is but a device that may or may not be employed in literary narratives, and the question of the literal location of the point of view is often of secondary or neg 5 For a detailed analysis of Ware's manipulation of the appearance and placement of text, see Kannenberg. Kannenberg also discusses the ways in which Ware's work portrays simultane ity in comics, blending two narratives in one through contrasting patterns of words and pictures, or what he calls the instances "in which perceived experience is colored by intellectual action" (183). 6 See, for instance, Bortolussi and Dixon's revision of the focalization term from a psycho logical viewpoint (166-78).</page><page sequence="5">Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology 641 ligible importance (cf. 76). The disagreement, however, may not be as large as it seems since Genette's argument about ambiguity in the location or the identity of the focalizing does not imply that literary narratives do not need any spa tial vantage point. As the invention of concepts such as Manfred Jahn's "zero," "weak," and "ambient focalization" (98), David Herman's "hypothetical focaliza tion" (Story Logic 333), and Fludernik's "neutral narrative situation" (Towards 172-77) also indicate, it is not always possible to locate any exact point of percep tion in literary narrative discourse. Linguistic markers of spatial deictics can be relaxed in written discourse in ways that are not possible in images and their visual deictic markers. II. Focalizer and Focalized In the analysis of graphic storytelling, it is often important to be less rigorous in the distinction between the source of focalization and the entity focalized. This is significant in at least two senses: in terms of the importance of consistency and identity in what is perceived (or what Mieke Bal would call the focalized), and in terms of the question of embedded focalization, taking different forms in visual narratives from literary narratives. The Process of Following What seems to matter from the point of view of narrativity in much of visual storytelling, in first-person and third-person narratives alike, is that the main char acter or the narrator and sometimes other elements like a landscape or cityscape are regularly shown in the images, that is, included in the space of the image as the focalized. In graphic narratives, the depiction of a person and his or her field of vision from one moment to another, being embedded in a setting and engaged in action, is a strong cohesive device that increases narrativity in any sequence of images. Likewise, indicators of a character's direction or the field of a person's gaze can give us a strong sense of narrative continuity between the images. Such indicators may be derived, for example, from the shot/reverse shot technique or by positioning a character closely to the picture frame. Notice in these two panels from Eric Drooker's 'mute' graphic novel Flood! (subtitled "a novel in pictures") how the close-up of the cartoonist's eyes, looking at the man whom he has drawn and whom we see in a panel below, brings us close to the artist's point of view. The subsequently represented field of vision then embraces the cartoonist-character's viewpoint (see fig. I).7 This is also one of the several moments in Flood! that in troduce an ambivalent ontological and temporal shift in the story from the place and moment of drawing to the time and space of the 'embedded' narrative. In this case, the embedded narrative is an illustration of an Eskimo hunter's song—and 7 Eric Drooker is an American painter and illustrator who has also designed the animation for the film Howl, based on Allen Ginsberg's poem of the same title.</page><page sequence="6">642 Kai Mikkonen one of the few moments where words are used in the story that otherwise closely follows the main character's continuous movement. Fig. 1: Eric Drooker, Flood!, n.pag.</page><page sequence="7">Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology 643 The crucial role of the person or figure who is the focus of attention from one panel to the next demonstrates the process of following that functions as an im portant principle of organization in storytelling across media. Rick Altman has suggested in his seminal study on transmedial narrative theory, A Theory of Nar rative (2008), that the filter of following in narratives, which can be analyzed in terms of following-units and following-patterns from single to dual and multiple focus narratives, is "essential to the very category of the narrative: wherever there is narrative there is following" (21).8 Furthermore, Altman claims that the pro cess of following characters is more central to narrative texts than the question of point of view. He refrains from using the term 'focalization,' which he sees to be applicable to selected texts and only some segments of those texts. By the lat ter, he means narratives with a clearly identifiable character's point of view as in third-person literary narratives with a consistent reflector figure. Even if Altman's approach, thus, regrettably simplifies the question of focalization by restricting it to cases of fixed internal focalization, his notion that all narratives necessar ily have following-units is worth serious attention, specifically with regard to vi sual narratives and drama, where the narrator's role is usually limited. This shifts the emphasis in narrative theory away from a narrow consideration of 'action' or 'event,' often seen as divorced from characters, and relaxes the requirement that narratives must always have focalizers, narrators, or both. The focus on the process of following is also highly relevant in the context of graphic storytelling since the person or figure who is followed tends to import perceptual information and subjective vision into the image.9 There is a potential focalizer in every focalized person: Images reveal looks, fields of vision, and so on. This potential is similar to that of literary narratives, but images also literally reveal acts of perception from the outside, that is, from an external viewpoint. What I want to argue about focalization in comics in this respect in particular is that the focalizer (and the identity of the focalizer) is often less important, or more ambiguous, than the focalized. The latter does not just mean the object of focal ization but the viewer's understanding of the relation between the given point of view and the character who is being followed. Embedded Focalization The distinction between the source of focalization and the entity focalized is similarly relaxed, or remains ambiguous, in the technique of embedded focaliza tion, which takes similar yet ultimately different forms in comics (and visual sto rytelling) compared with verbal narratives. What Mieke Bal calls an embedding of focalizations involves transference between subject and object positions along 8 In a single-focus narrative, the narrator follows a single character throughout the narra tive, whereas in dual-focus narrative, the attention is on two groups whose conflict provides the plot; in multiple-focus narratives, the following-pattern attends to several separate characters. 9 Another way of saying this would be that the characters have high salience in comics. Their salience may be both compositional and 'psychological' in nature. For the notion of sa lience in images, see Kress and van Leeuwen 61, 212-14.</page><page sequence="8">644 Kai Mikkonen different diegetic levels in a narrative, for instance when some narrative object (the object of narrating, focalizing, or acting) becomes the subject (the narrator, the focalizer, or the principal actor) of the following level (cf. Bal, "Notes" 45). Another possibility of the same phenomenon is that the external focalizer in a narrative watches "along with a person" but without leaving focalization entirely to this character (Bal, Narratology 159). The technique, Bal suggests, is compa rable to free indirect discourse, in which the narrative discourse approximates some character's voice without letting him or her speak directly (cf. 159).10 In vi sual terms, this may be likened to the many techniques that subjectify the field of vision without turning the image into a pure subjective shot, such as an over the-shoulder shot in film. In comics and graphic narratives, similarly, the image may be shown from behind a character's back, or, as is the case in the process of following, the image may follow a character's movement closely, as if the point of view were tied to this movement. Patrick O'Neill's transmedial version of the notion of embedded focalization, however, which he develops to a significant degree with regard to narrative tech niques in comics, is unable to come to terms with the specific features of embed ded perspectives in the graphic medium. O'Neill finds the effect of embedded perspectives to be much more central to focalization in fiction than the categories of external and internal focalization. The latter, he believes, are "entirely rela tive terms, since any particular focalization [...] can (like narration) be contained or embedded within another" (333), by which he means that character focaliza tion can always be embedded in an external narrator focalization. Furthermore, O'Neill suggests that what he calls "covert global external focalization," meaning the implicit perspective of the implied author, frames any explicit perspective in a narrative. It is telling that O'Neill builds his argument of covert global external focalization on a reading of Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes cartoons (1985 1995). Without giving reference to any particular strip or story, O'Neill argues that the implied author's covert focalization can be detected in the graphic style of this series, that is, in the reality of the characters drawn as cartoon characters. This is an important suggestion since the graphic style, which is highlighted in experimental graphic narratives such as Jimmy Corrigan and Asterios Polyp, is indeed an indicator of a kind of implied global perspective, potentially creating meaningful contrasts with the narrative voices and visual or verbal perspectives in the story. Yet the notion of covert global external focalization obviously renders the whole meaning of focalization self-contradictory since the position of the implied author cannot be visualized in terms of a focus of perception. And, furthermore, we still have to pose a medium-specific question about the transfer of narrato 10 However, scholars like Genette famously reject the notion of embedded focalization in literature, claiming that the focus of the narrative cannot be at two points simultaneously, even if it may happen that a narrative mentions "a glance that perceives another glance" (77). What Bal defines as embedded focalization, Genette would simply call displacement of focus (76). The question remains how literally we may take the idea of simultaneity in a written text and perhaps also how much attention readers pay to micro-level shifts in focalization versus structures of global macro-level focalization.</page><page sequence="9">Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology 645 logical concepts across media: What would be the equivalent of graphic style in literary narratives, or vice versa? Is linguistic or literary style—whatever elements we may consider as constituting literary style—comparable to a graphic line, col or scheme, or caricature, and how can this (graphic style) be attributed to the implied author? It is equally difficult to find the literary equivalent of the tech niques of perspective filtering in Calvin and Hobbes, where the mere presence of some figures in the scene may indicate a change in perspective. Most importantly, when only Calvin and Hobbes are present in the image, Hobbes is not drawn as a stuffed animal but as a living being, an anthropomorphized tiger. This is one of the sophisticated means of focalization in this series that O'Neill believes to be different only in degree from the techniques used in literary narratives. The effect is based, however, not so much on inferring how the graphic style reveals a narratorial or authorial perspective that might embed other perspectives, but on visual information about the supposed focalizer in the image. The child focalizer (Calvin) is simultaneously often shown from the outside. Hobbes is shown in a particular way in particular images—either alive or not alive—since we have come to learn that certain people, whom we also see present in the image (Calvin or his parents or someone else), tend to see Hobbes in this way. What Calvin and Hobbes shows to us is that in visual narratives such as comics internal and external focalizers can appear simultaneously, in a literal sense, at different points inside and outside the image frame. Characters in panels reveal perceptual information by looking at something, figures look into the image from the side of the images or out of them as if engaging the reader with their gaze, pictures within pictures convey additional viewpoints, and so on. Furthermore, a conscious play with the divergence and convergence between visual and ver bal perspectives, or between graphic style, point of view and verbal narration, is a common practice in graphic fiction such as Chris Ware's work, Mike Mignola and John Byrne's Hellboy, or Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen as well as in contemporary autobiographical and other nonfiction graphic narratives (Baetens 83-84). The possibility to manipulate and combine internal and external perspectives in this way is different from literary narratives where the possibility to present characters at the same time from the outside and from within is usually an indicator of fictionality (Patron 169). As Jan Baetens has argued, even if the same person is responsible for the visual and ver bal narrative channels and there is divergence on their content level, there is never a guarantee that these two aspects would converge so as to convey the same im pression of subjectivity or objectivity (82). Baetens refers, for instance, to the split narratorial position in Emmanuel Guibert's biography La Guerre d'Alan (2000 2008, translated as Alan's War, 2008), where the autobiographical verbal narra tion by G. I. Alan Ingram Cope is "in a certain sense quoted within the broader narrative frame" by the cartoonist Guibert (84). The same question of split narratorial position, and the difficulty of distin guishing between graphic voice and style, figures prominently in first-person fic tional graphic narratives. Think of the personalized techniques and stylistic de vices in Mazzucchelli's Asterios Polyp and how the characters' emotions, or the emotional content of their thoughts, as well as changes in the narrator, are also</page><page sequence="10">646 Kai Mikkonen reflected in varying visual styles and colors or their combinations. It is hardly nec essary for the understanding of this graphic novel to think that the story's main narrator Ignazio, who is the central character's (Asterios's) dead twin brother, is responsible for all the stylistic choices in the narrative let alone for the showing of the images or the composition of the page setup. However, it is possible to build an argument concerning a narrator who not only 'speaks' but also draws. The reason for this is that Mazzucchelli's work and its narrator are exceedingly self-aware of their own visual form and medium. One feature that could suggest this kind of reading is the moment when we first read the narrator's lines. This takes place when we are shown an image of a man in silhouette, accompanied by the lines: "If it were possible for me to narrate this story, I'd begin here. THIS is Asterios Polyp." The deictic expression 'this' is in capital letters and highlighted, thus indicating the narrator's capacity to show images and point to things in them. The narrator is highly conscious of the con tents and styles of the images. To the extent that we as readers are aware of the narrator's active filtering of the events and voices in his narrative, this may further affect the way the reader sees and interprets the images, including their coloring and other significant features, as being inevitably tied to the narrator's (and not just the author's) activity and perspective-taking. III. Personal vs. Impersonal Vantage Point In visual storytelling, impersonal focalization is a much more prominent and perhaps broader phenomenon than in literary narratives.11 Visual narration across media can deploy a broad scale of techniques between more or less personal or impersonal perspectives, from panoramic views that no person could see to partly sharing subjective vision and to a point-of-view image. One explanation for, but also a result of, this vast scale of varied and combinable options in focalization is, to follow François Jost (cf. 195), the difficulty in designating the degree of deixis in an image—in a wordless single image, that is. Think of the example from Eric Drooker's Flood! cited above, where the sequence of the two images on the same page clearly cues us to see the picture of the Eskimo hunter as the cartoonist's point-of-view image but does not reveal much of the seer's attitude or interest in terms of what he sees (we may, possibly, make some inferences of his attitude from the facial expression and the surrounding narrative). More precisely, this 11 Much of the critique of anthropomorphism in focalization theory, meaning the assump tion that the focalizer would always be a person who perceives, has been based on the insight that we need to pay more attention to techniques of impersonal narrative perspectives in fiction. Here, one could mention not just Fludernik's notion of neutral narrative, but also Ann Banfield's linguistic analysis of narrative sentences that are distinctly fictional, or Sylvie Patron's critique of the traditional communicational theory of narrative. Banfield and Patron are more radical than Fludernik, as they argue that the narrator (and not only the focalizer) is an option in liter ary narratives. O'Neill critiques the same anthropomorphic assumption in a different context, stressing that the focalizer is not a person or an agent, but "a chosen point, the point from which the narrative is perceived as being presented at any given moment" (333).</page><page sequence="11">Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology 647 impenetrability of the seer's mind involves the degree to which an image not only represents some exterior world but also refers to someone who sees that world. In a narrative context, this difficulty can be bypassed by image-to-image transitions and juxtapositions, the angle of vision, information coming from the verbal nar rative track, and by other means. Image-to-image transitions, symbolic signs, and verbal information may easily explain the emotions involved in an act of percep tion. Nonetheless, the identity of the focalizer and the subjective meanings of the image can always remain ambiguous to a significant degree. Even when we are dealing with clear cases of a point-of-view image, it may be difficult to evaluate the degree of subjectivity in the field of vision. Another example of a recent reading of comics in narrative theory appears in David Herman's analyses of Daniel Clowes's graphic novel Ghost World.12 Her man turns to this graphic novel in two separate publications, including his book Basic Elements of Narrative, where it serves as one of his four primary case stud ies in his transmedial theory of narrative. Herman's project is groundbreaking not only for outlining the constant features in narratives across media or for illustrat ing to us the benefits in analyzing graphic narratives in this context, but also for bringing to our attention relevant work on perspective-taking in cognitive lin guistics. Furthermore, he articulates two goals for future research that have mo tivated my discussion: a fully developed narratology of graphic narratives and the study of narrative mediation in multimodal documents. The latter goal involves the ways by which multimodal texts prompt readers to integrate the reflexes of perspective-taking processes from various semiotic channels, such as verbal and visual channels, at the same time ("Beyond" 139). Yet I would argue that Herman's analysis of Clowes's graphic novel is also an example of an overly facile equation between media with respect to their sup posedly isomorphic strategies, or what he and cognitive linguists call perspec tive-related parameters that are relevant in all narrative representation.13 In his reading of the following scene (see fig. 2), Herman carefully points out how the perspective gradually shifts from the more external viewpoint of the first panel to the internal perspective of the third, associated with the main characters in the foreground, the cynical teenagers Rebecca Doppelmeyer and Enid Coleslaw, who sit at the table in a café. 12 Clowes is an American cartoonist of alternative comics whose many graphic novels, such as Ghost World, have first appeared as series in his anthology Eightball. 13 These parameters include, as in Leonard Talmy's cognitive semantics, the location of a perspective point with a "referent scene," the distance of a perspective point from the regarded scene, the perspectival mode and the direction of viewing (cf. Herman, "Beyond," 130). All of these aspects of perspective-taking are relevant with regard to graphic storytelling and suggest new areas of research.</page><page sequence="12">648 Kai Mikkonen 3 HATE that h6's an ann&lt;?yin£ cfack applct • --plms. hg's a00mt a4 £ht6 as t£&gt;hnnl&lt;) ape^hrr! , Fig. 2: Daniel Clowes, "Ghost World" 20. Herman argues that Clowes deploys here the multimodal equivalent of a print text's use of third-person or heterodiegetic narration that moves along a spectrum from relatively more external to relatively more internal views—that is, from external focalization, where the vantage point on events is not associated with a character in the storyworld, to internal focal ization, where the vantage-point is in fact a character's. (Basic Elements 61; repeated almost verbatim in "Beyond" 138-39) It is easy to agree about the gradual shift in focalization in this scene and how it evolves into a kind of shot/reverse shot juxtaposition between Rebecca's and Enid's vantage points in the subsequent panels. My problem with the analysis, however, is the reference to the multimodal equivalent of a technique of narrative</page><page sequence="13">Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology 649 mediation based on an interpretation of the perspective in the third panel. The perspective, Herman insists, is mediated through the perceptions of one of the main characters, who, he assumes, is 'most probably' Rebecca, given her location, physical orientation, and direction of gaze in the first two panels. What I find particularly problematic in this interpretation is the need to identify the one who sees (focalizer). There seems to be no reason to object to the idea that the field and focus of vision in the third panel is close to Rebecca's vantage point or that we are looking at the man in the image as if we were looking with her or even through her. But at the same time, there does not seem to be any reason, theoretical or practical, why we should tie the visual perspective to one particular character. Another reading, and in my mind a less forced one, would be to conclude that the perspective is not mediated through any one character, but rather that it falls within the perceptual range of both Rebecca and Enid without being directly attributed to either char acter's subjective vision. First of all, both pointers of the speech bubbles (their 'tails' indicating the speaker and her position) come from outside the field of vi sion—from the sides of the frame—and are located at the same level, thus indicat ing that both voices have the same relation to the perspective. Second, the verbal cues marking focalization in this passage suggest that both girls are looking at the men at the back of the room. Enid's comment that she hates "these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo-bohemian art-school losers!" can be taken as a comment on the man whom we see in the panel. The dynamic between the visual and verbal narrative tracks (or focalization) therefore contributes to the effect of two simul taneously subjectivized but not wholly subjective perspectives. A note appended to Herman's reading of this passage exposes the analyst's uncertainty over how to attribute the visual perspective. Here, Herman belies his original claim about internal focalization, while also mistaking the identity of the voice in the third panel: Although it is arguable that this panel shifts away from the characters' acts of construal to a straightforward narratorial report of a moment of storyworld time, Rebecca's use of the demonstrative pronoun in "I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo bohemian art-school losers" might also be interpreted as a reference to a feature of the storyworld that falls within the domain of the characters' current perceptions. (138 nl3) We have all reason to think, however, that the speaker of these lines is not Rebec ca, but her friend Enid. This is confirmed by the attribution of the speech bubble to the right side of the panel, which we know to be Enid's position. I presume that this may not just be a simple mistake in attribution on Herman's part, but symp tomatic of an attempt to translate the ambiguous subjective vision and perspec tival simultaneity in the image in terms of the narrative techniques of focalization that are more familiar from verbal figurai narration. I do not wish to overemphasize the meaning of this self-contradictory inter pretive move. For readers of Ghost World, it may not really matter all that much who is seeing or if 'anyone' is seeing at all, since we know (culturally and intui tively) that images always show things from some perspective. But on a theoreti cal level, it does make sense to pose the question of the specific structures and strategies of visual perspective in so far as we seek to find common ground in</page><page sequence="14">650 Kai Mikkonen narrative techniques across media. Difficulty in designating the degree of deixis in an image is an important medium-specific aspect to be considered, as is the fact that different types of focalization in graphic narratives do not fall as easily within the external/internal divide as in literary narratives. The default mode in visual focalization, at least in stories like Ghost World, seems to be an external viewpoint, yet one that is, to a varying degree, subjectivized by various visual, stylistic, and compositional techniques. These techniques include conventions for creating a specific relation between the picture frame and the focalizer, and be tween the focalizer and the focalized, such as the point-of-view image, the gaze image, the eye-line image/match cut, the over-the-shoulder image and reaction image, or perception image (representing a character's way of perceiving).14 Sty listic means of graphic storytelling, such as the expressive use of the graphic line and colors, or means of spatial organization, including the gutter, the shape and size of the frame, and mise en page in general, can also present and accentuate someone's perceptions (cf. Groensteen, Système 107-19). Furthermore, it may be significant for the understanding of Clowes's story that the seeming fusion of the two characters' perspectives has the potential to indicate similarity in their senti ments and attitude. The sense of shared point of view can also be more literal in visual narration, as different perspectives are spatially embedded within one another. The spatial arrangement of comics, equally, can accentuate the illusion of simultaneity of different perspectives more literally than the temporal order of film. In literary narratives, we-narration and ambivalent you-narratives offer interesting parallels to this sense of shared perspective even if the reader's access to a character's visual perception in literature remains different in nature (more metaphorical). My emphasis in this essay has been the medium-specificity of comics and graphic storytelling in relation to their means of focalization. As we are expe riencing an exciting period of growth and diversification in comics studies, and as there is increasing interest in exploring the connections between comics stud ies and narrative theory, I think it is all the more important to carefully think through the medium-specific affordances, conventions, and elements in comics. Concerning the concept of focalization, I have posed a number of medium-specif ic questions that should be accounted for in order for us to conceive a more com prehensive narratology of perspective and narrative mediation in comics. These include the problems of epistemic access to the point of perception and of what is perceived, the importance of a consistent focus of attention and the process of following, embedded and simultaneous focalization in a literal sense (requiring a reconceptualization of the notion of embedded focalization), the variety of op tions in focalization between personal and impersonal views in visual storytelling, and the degree of deixis and subjectivity in images. These are certainly not the only important questions to ask about the possibilities of transmedial narratology vis-à-vis comics or even about the more limited issue of focalization in comics, but they are ones that I believe to be of great value for any transmedial narrative theory that seeks to be relevant for comics studies and across narrative media. I discuss these and similar perspectival techniques in Mikkonen, "Focalization."</page><page sequence="15">Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology 651 In transmedial narratology, problems will arise if we assume that notions of narrative theory and mediation can be transferred from one medium to another without due modification. But once we have a clearer idea of the specific quali ties of the medium, together with a better understanding of the shared elements between narrative media, modifications become possible. Finally, it must be em phasized that some of the properties that differentiate comics from written nar ratives, and in particular many of those that involve visual techniques of perspec tive-taking, are shared elements across a group of visual narrative media. By this I mean the necessity to construct a mid-level theoretical abstraction between a particular narrative medium (such as comics) and the common features of all nar rative media: a universal grammar of pictorial (or visual) narration that plays a role in a number of visual or multimodal media.15 One challenge in transmedial narratology, therefore, is that it needs to develop in three different directions at once: the investigation of shared elements across all narrative media (such as iso morphic strategies in all narratives regardless of the medium), the specificities of a given medium (properties that are not shared by other media), and the study of common properties in a group of related media (such as common features of visual narratives media). Whether this is viable remains to be seen, but at least for comics narratology a whole new era has begun. 15 I am using Christiansen's formulation of "universal grammar of pictorial narration" to underscore how comics have gathered their expressive resources not just from particular other media, such as cinema, or from institutionalized genres, but from common picture-narrating features across various visual forms of expression (112).
