I was walking through midtown Manhattan, on my way to the show, barely ten blocks from the museum. Superimposed over a large photograph of the Brooklyn Dodgers was a smaller reproduction of Joseph Stella's The Brooklyn Bridge: Variation on an Old Theme (1939)-a modernist painting of the bridge that makes it a soaring icon of twentieth-century America: a cathedral of lights, cars, skyscrapers. Like a bull's-eye in Kirsten Swinth is an assistant professor of history at Fordham University. She is the author of the forthcoming Painting Professionals: Women Artists and the Development of American Art, 1870-1930. American Quarterly, Vol. 52, No. 4 (December 2000) Â© 2000 American Studies Association 720</page><page sequence="2">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 721 the center of the advertisement, The Brooklyn Bridge made an arresting juxtaposition to the Dodgers. Positioned above and below the images was the advertisement's tag: "Make Some Sense of America. The American Century at The Whitney." It was an enticing invitation. What did the Dodgers have to do with Stella's painting? How could they "make sense" of "America"? The billboard implied that the museum had configured a cultural landscape that placed modernist art on the same playing field as the symbols of popular culture. "Context" and "art" did indeed occupy wall spaces throughout both halves of the exhibition, with photographs, industrial objects, posters, movies, mu- sic, and television suggesting the complex formation of American culture over the last hundred years. Here, with the Dodgers and the Bridge cheek to cheek, was what was the best, the most compelling and intriguing about this exhibition. But, it was also the oddest. Vying with the pictured icons in the billboard was that charged phrase, "The American Century," Henry Luce's famous 1941 paean to America as a world power. The billboard's declarative grammar promised that the "sense" to be made of America lay not in the leveled playing field of Brooklyn Dodgers and modernist painting, but in Luce's American Century. In its promotion, layout, wall texts, and catalogue, the exhibition systematically repeated Luce's triumphalism. It's a familiar, Irving Sandlerish narrative of twentieth- century American art.1 The exhibition eagerly pointed us to Jackson Pollock, with an edge of disappointment that it took half the century for him to appear and more than a pang that Abstract Expressionism's moment of hegemony lasted only a decade or so. In fact, the Whitney prioritized Joseph Stella over the Dodgers. The "sense" to be made of the American Century lay in modernism. European modernism, rather than American popular culture, was the reference point for the show. Maxwell Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum, explained why the second part of the exhibition was "a history of the avant-garde": "This focus is warranted ... by the leading role [that] American art has played on the international scene since 1950."2 The avant-garde stood for American cultural hegemony which in turn stood for American culture in the twentieth century.</page><page sequence="3">722 AMERICAN QUARTERLY The American Century: Art &amp; Culture, 1900-2000 was a two-part exhibition on display at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York for the past year. Curated by Barbara Haskell, curator of prewar art at the museum since 1975, and Susan Cooke, an associate curator at the museum, Part I covered the first half of the century. For the second half, the museum assembled a second curatorial team. Lisa Phillips, former curator of contemporary art at the museum and now director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, curated the exhibition, with associate curators Susan Willis and Kurt Willers, both experienced organizers of contemporary art exhibitions. The museum, however, conceived of the show as a single exhibition. On display were over twelve hundred works of painting, sculpture, and photography, plus related materials in architecture, decorative arts, design, music, dance, literature, and film. Curators scattered artifacts of American popular culture throughout the exhibition-Vogue and Vanity Fair covers, Irving Berlin sheet-music, issues of The Masses and Opportunity, movie posters for The Thing and I Married a Communist, a "pad" complete with bean bag chairs and lava lamps, and The Simpsons playing on a tiny television in the stairwell. Each half of the exhibition occupied the museum entirely, with visitors shuttled to the top floor to work down through the museum, moving roughly decade by decade with each floor. To visit the show was like taking a one-semester survey of American art (only more exhausting because you saw it all in a few hours). It had all the characteristics of the survey course: "greatest hits" flashed on the screen; movements and counter-movements displayed in seemingly logical order; offbeat artists popping up here and there (the quirky favorites of the instructor, perhaps); and a smattering of history and popular culture thrown in for good measure. In that sense, the show (and its companion two-part catalogue) are a valuable practical guide for those teaching such courses and for those looking for ways to integrate art into their syllabi for other American studies courses. The website that accompanies the exhibition follows the survey motif. Important images have been posted above a timeline of cultural, social, and political events. Web visitors can read a discussion of the image and a biography of the artist and examine related audiovisual materials. Following the show's own spirit of survey, I'll tour the show, replicating, for the moment, its decade by decade organization. The exhibition begins with "America in the Age of Confidence," its wall</page><page sequence="4">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 723 text announcing America's "youthful confidence" as a nation poised to occupy "a prominent place on the world stage." A gallery reminds visitors that the genteel tradition continued well into the twentieth century, with paintings and portraits by Thomas Eakins and Cecilia Beaux among others. Beaux's Mrs. Larz Anderson (1900-1901), done in the high society style with a gown of swirling, lacy whites, serves as a useful touchstone for the rest of the floor. Most of the exhibits are a clear contrast: John Sloan's Picture Shop Window (1907-1908) with men and women before a modem plate-glass window eyeing each other and the pictures inside; Lewis Hine's Sadie at Work, Lancaster Cotton Mill (1908), a stark photograph exposing the realities of child labor; Arnold Genthe's photographs of Chinatown in San Francisco; and teasing early films on white slavery and East Side urchins. Cubism, Futurism, and New York Dada also make Mrs. Larz Anderson unques- tionably antiquated: it's impossible to imagine Marcel Duchamp's urinal (submitted in 1917 as The Fountain for its first, scandalous provocation of the art world) belonging to the same moment. Works by Marius de Zayas, Paul Strand, Marsden Hartley, and Joseph Stella among others occupy galleries dedicated to "urban modernism." Stella's Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras (1913-1914) is a particu- larly orgiastic celebration of the lights, rides, and uninhibited behavior at commercial amusements that participants adored and Progressives bemoaned. A more somber note of retreat pervades nostalgic works by Thomas Wilmer Dewing, Arthur Mathews, the tonalists, and Edward Curtis's photographs of Native Americans (including Canyon de Chelly [1904] and Watching the Dancers [1906]) as well as the nature abstractions of modernists Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Marguerite Zorach, and William Zorach. The next floor concentrates on the 1920s, envisioning an American culture "dominated by youthful exuberance and stylized glamour."3 A central rotunda organizes the floor with Dudley Murphy's Black and Tan Fantasy (1929), featuring Duke Ellington at the Cotton Club, projected on one wall. The movie highlights the importance of jazz, urban nightlife, and the Harlem Renaissance to the decade's culture. James VanDerZee photographs of Harlem, Aaron Douglas's cubist- inspired graphic work for Opportunity, and Archibald Motley, Jr.'s painting Cocktails (1926) all document the complex vitality of the African-American artistic community. Jazz serves as the reference point for art of the streamlined city and consumer culture as well. Paul</page><page sequence="5">724 AMERICAN QUARTERLY Frankl's Skyscraper Bookcase (1926) and Norman Bel Geddes's "Sky- scraper" Cocktail Shaker, Cocktail Glasses and Tray (1937) appear in galleries near Georgia O'Keeffe's evocative Ritz Tower, Night (1928) and Hugh Ferriss's looming architectural drawings. In another section, Edward Hopper's Chop Suey (1929) and Florine Stetteheimer's Spring Sale at Bendel's (1921) evoke opposing moods-Hopper's trademark alienation and loneliness, Stettheimer's whimsical spectacle. Stuart Davis's Lucky Strike (1921) adds a Cubist collage of modem mass- produced packaging. Outside the city, Precisionist paintings by Charles Sheeler, Charles Demuth, and Elsie Driggs and photographs of the machine and factory by Paul Strand, Margaret Bourke-White, and Paul Outerbridge all portray the modem industrial landscape. Lewis Hine's photograph Powerhouse Mechanic (1925) and Charlie Chaplin's film Modern Times (1936) provide an alternative to the airless machine aesthetic of the Precisionists. Hine's photograph juxtaposes human muscles to machine power, equating them, yet questioning any simple positive correlation between the two. Finally, some artists continued to repudiate the machine and the city, creating abstract paintings of nature (Agnes Pelton, John Marin, Henrietta Shore, and Marsden Hartley) and crystalline photographs of the landscape (Laura Gilpin and Ansel Adams). Others, including Imogen Cunningham, Edward Weston, and Man Ray transform the body into a kind of landscape, photographing the nude with sensuous detail. The Depression, we learn rather predictably, "heralded profound change in the visual arts." Photography, not surprisingly, occupies a prominent place. Margaret Bourke-White's The Louisville Flood (1937), Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother (1936), and Walker Evans's Ala- bama Sharecropper's Wife (1936) are among the most familiar, with additional works by Gordon Parks, Eudora Welty, and Aaron Siskind. (Siskind led the "Harlem Document," a collective, documentary project of the Photo League that combined words and images by eight photographers.) Ben Shahn's The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti (1931- 1932), Philip Evergood's American Tragedy (1936), and Reginald Marsh's Why Not Use the "L" ? (1930) depict scenes of social protest and urban despair, while regionalists-Grant Wood, John Steuart Curry, and Thomas Hart Benton-resurrect "mythic American val- ues-community, hard work, and steadfast determination." The Migra- tion of the Negro (1940-1941), Jacob Lawrence's gripping multi- paneled narrative of the Great Migration with silhouette forms,</page><page sequence="6">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 725 compressed perspective, and primary colors, recovers, like the work of so many artists in this period, a "usable past." Most unexpected amidst Depression-era realism are the works by a "small but committed" group of abstract artists, including Arshile Gorky, Alice Trumbull Mason, Ad Reinhardt, and Alexander Calder. Highly controversial in a decade of politicized art, these abstractionists are critical to The American Century's purposes: by the late 1930s, with a more "ges- tural" style, they (the wall text informs viewers) began to move to the forefront of the art world and anticipated Abstract Expressionism. But the war intervened to complicate any easy rise. The curators have hung patriotic propaganda alongside more uneasy renderings of the war and its aftermath. Expected icons of the war like Joe Rosenthal's famous photograph, Old Glory Goes Up on Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima (1945), Norman Rockwell's poster for the Office of War Information, Freedom From Want (1943), and newsreels by Frank Capra, John Huston, and John Ford all appear. More ambivalent artists explored alienation and uncertainty, especially after the war. Yasuo Kuniyoshi, for example, depicted three worn figures in a haunting landscape in Deliverance (1947) while Andrew Wyeth pictured a lone boy dwarfed by a barren hill in Winter, 1946 (1946). A similar disquiet turned abstract artists toward mythical, highly subjective themes, most notably in Adolph Gottlieb's Vigil (1948) where rectilinear sections contain Native Ameri- can- and African-inspired image-symbols. Among those working in this mode were Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, and these men and their cohort, part of a new generation, ensured that "New York ... replace[d] Paris as the center of the contemporary art world. . . . The ambition, spontaneity, and scale that characterized this new American painting coincided with the country's ascendance on the world stage." Appropriately, the first part of the exhibition ends with Pollock's drip painting, Number 27 (1950). The second half of the show begins at the same moment. Pollock's Number 27 reprises its place of honor, inviting viewers into the first part of the exhibition, titled "America Takes Command." Wall text reminds visitors that, after World War II, New York supplanted Paris, and American art "asserted its presence on the world stage." Expected figures-Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, David Smith, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, and Barnett Newman-all follow Pollock in the next several galleries. Because of Abstract Expressionism's macho ethos, its women practitioners often disappear. This show corrects that bias, with</page><page sequence="7">726 AMERICAN QUARTERLY works by Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Joan Mitchell, Grace Hartigan, and Helen Frankenthaler. A lilting canvas of arabesques and organic, biomorphic forms in hot pink and a cool green, Lee Krasner's The Seasons (1957) stands out along with Louise Bourgeois's wonderful abstract personnages, totemic figures of carved wood, sometimes painted, and clustered together in assemblages.4 The first of six "cultural sites" in the second half of the exhibition sets the Cold War context for Abstract Expressionism. These cultural sites offer more focused explorations of the art's historical context than in Part I. The Cold War site displays banned books, movie posters, and a period television set running period shows. Although evocative, it's not exactly clear how these artifacts connect to Abstract Expressionism. I found myself wondering how Willem de Kooning's Woman and Bicycle (1952-1953) would fare if hung next to the poster from I Married a Communist (1949) rather than beside Jackson Pollock. Would de Kooning look paranoid rather than heroic? In the second half of this floor, a more varied view of the 1950s emerges with Figurative Expressionism (Richard Diebenkorn, Edward Hopper), and Happen- ings, Fluxus, and Early Performance (Fluxboxes and Fluxkits were filled with miscellaneous printed material, games, and puzzles and then sold in the Fluxshop or through mail order). By the late 1950s, a new mood moved to the forefront of American art. Artists called the expressionist grand gesture into question and replaced subjectivity with found objects, the detritus of routine exist- ence. (The catalogue aptly characterizes this shift as a move from "emotional dramatics" to "cool detachment."5) Emblematic of the new orientation are Robert Rauschenberg's Satellite (1955), an assemblage with doilies, socks, comics, other Americana, and stuffed pheasant and Jasper Johns's Three Flags (1958), whose three flags are surprisingly both reductive (painting as object) and sensual (the textured surface of encaustic). The mood of detachment becomes the dominant motif of the next floor of the exhibition as Pop artists like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, and Ed Ruscha combined the imagery of mass culture with the techniques of commercial art. Minimalists also stripped their works bare of personal referents. Robert Morris's Un- titled (L Beams) (1965), for example, uses basic, geometrical forms made of industrial materials to explore questions of space, weight, and gravity. For much of the rest of the 1960s and into the 1970s, artists explored these basic materials but made the process of art-making itself</page><page sequence="8">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 727 a subject. More "open and indeterminate" than the Minimalists' rigid geometries, Eva Hesse's latex over rope and string, Untitled (Rope Piece) (1969-1970), Barry Le Va's felt and glass, Continuous and Related Activities: Discontinued by the Act of Dropping (1967), and a series of dance and performance pieces on video, including Robert Morris's Wisconsin (1970), stress component parts, random composi- tion, and arbitrary artistic action.6 Located between the Minimalists and the Post-Minimalists is another "cultural site," this one focusing on the counterculture and protest movements. Curator Maurice Berger gathered quite wonderful images and artifacts-Ernest Withers's I Am a Man (a photograph of a civil rights march), Bob Dylan's and Joan Baez's music, and a collection of protest posters, among them. Again, though, it's not always clear how the cultural site-with its impas- sioned protest themes-connects to the cooler Pop and Minimalist art in the galleries. The cultural site, however, makes more sense in light of the exhibition's next floor-"The Rise of Alternatives"-where a more overtly politically and critically engaged art emerges with Conceptual Art works like Eleanor Antin's body sculpture, Carving: A Traditional Sculpture (1972) and Hans Haacke's dissections of the power structure. Works by Hannah Wilke, Nancy Spero, Carolee Schneemann, and Miriam Schapiro register the impact of feminism, while earthworks by Robert Smithson, Walter de Maria, Christo, Michael Heizer, and Nancy Holt echo the concerns of the environmental movement. The 1980s and 1990s appear under the guise of loosely constructed, pluralistic categories-"A Resurgence of Painting," "Street Culture: The New Bohemia," "The Mediated World," for example. Included are the infamous like Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano (the much- attacked creator of Piss Christ [1987]), both artists who became flashpoints for the "Culture Wars" which a final cultural site quite compellingly documents. Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat represent the graffiti and street-inspired art that became popular in the 1980s. One of the best works in the show, Nan Goldin's Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1976-1992), documents the underground world of the Lower East Side. A set of six hundred ninety slides, set to music, the work depicts Goldin's friends and lovers in a serial record of sex, clubs, gender-bending, lonely rooms, friends, drugs, and AIDS. This highly intimate exploration of personal history has shaped the work of a group of more recent artists, including Kiki Smith and Kara Walker. Other artists have explored the increasingly mediated nature of late twentieth-</page><page sequence="9">728 AMERICAN QUARTERLY century life, with works like Jenny Holzer's Laments (1989), in which LED signs scroll warnings above three stone coffins. In the past few years, video art, which first emerged in the late 1960s after Sony introduced its cheap, portable video camera the Portapak, but now created in conjunction with digital technologies, has stimulated enor- mous creativity. Bill Viola's The Tree of Knowledge (1997)-an interactive video installation-and Matthew Barney's Drawing Re- straint 7 (1993) bring the exhibition to a close. Although not all the works in the exhibition are comfortable to look at, taken as a whole, the exhibition is a comfortable and familiar survey. Even the shocking images seem merely discomfiting, sometimes even mundane, given the intense publicity generated by the "culture wars" of the last decade. The Whitney couldn't challenge visitors to view American art in a new light because its own organizing presumptions forestalled alternative narratives. Running through both halves of the exhibition are two narrative threads. The first is the chauvinistic, triumphalist declaration that this has been the "American Century." America "takes command," viewers are told; New York replaced Paris as the "center" of the contemporary art world, we learn; no longer a "provincial backwater" America has become a "cultural leader," we now understand; and after 1950, American art is "ascendant," we are relieved to hear.7 Repeated so often, these phrases drown out attempts to interrogate Luce's simplistic jingoism. The second theme is "Ameri- can identity." With similar insistence, the show's organizers, press materials, wall text, and catalogues aver that "the exhibition explores the changing character of American identity during the twentieth- century as seen through the eyes of our nation's artists."8 The exhibition sustains both of these narratives only by making familiar movements and modernist shibboleths synecdoches for the complex whole of the last century. The American century in art is really just an American moment. Only halfway through the century (and halfway through the exhibition) does Abstract Expressionism (and America's triumph) actually appear. How are we to take the first six hundred objects of the show dismissed so easily by curator Lisa Phillips as the products of a "provincial backwater"? Besides, Abstract Expressionism's reign is so clearly brief and fragmented. The show itself acknowledges the "kaleidoscopic" (wall text) and "dizzying" (Maxwell Anderson, museum director) character of the postwar art world. Moreover, the idea of "American identity" is so fractured and</page><page sequence="10">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 729 pluralistic that it is ultimately not very meaningful. To articulate any coherent "identity," the curators invoke values that are predictable, bland, and tied to the same liberal impulse as Luce's American Century. Most notable among them is America's ability to nurture individualism. "Today's art," according to the wall text at the end of Part II, "reflects the multiplicity of cultures and the power of individual expression that are, and probably always have been, America's greatest strength." That America fosters "individual expression" signifies America's liberal freedoms, the ingenuity of its people, and its justified international preeminence. The show implicitly makes the artist, pursuing his or her own creative vision, the true symbol of American democracy. This equation works only because the exhibition enshrines and naturalizes the modernist notion of artistic genius as self-expression. Despite the scholarly and social upheavals of the last few decades that have called into question both of The American Century's narrative frameworks, the Whitney was unable to extract itself from them. In part, it had a marketing problem. The imperialistic message of the exhibition conveniently corresponds to the imperialist dreams of the museum. Maxwell Anderson, the Whitney's director, argues that the show demonstrates the museum's "rightful place as a primary arbiter of American culture."9 The museum's alliance with Intel undoubtedly also encouraged its stance. (The American Century is officially "orga- nized" by the museum, but "presented" by Intel Corporation.) In fact, Intel's corporate interests are unabashedly the same liberal values underlying the narrative of American identity. Andrew Grove, chair of Intel, declares in a "Statement of Collaboration" that Intel proudly sponsored the exhibition because "the spirit of inventiveness, the openness to new ideas and technologies" in American art are the same energies that "gave birth to and propel American high-tech industry."10 The Whitney's organizing strategy is also partly a product of continued defensiveness about American art. Within the art historical establishment, American art has long been viewed as inferior and secondary, its traditions weak and uninteresting, leaving those working on the topic with a kind of uneasy doubt: America, as a nation, was a world power, but was its art? With this lingering specter, the continuing "problem" of American art has been to prove the validity of viewing, collecting, and studying American art works. A decade ago, Wanda Corn argued that the solution scholars had developed for this problem was to focus on the "uniqueness and exclusivity" of American cul-</page><page sequence="11">730 AMERICAN QUARTERLY ture-to see art as an expression of a distinctively American tradition and identity. So, she suggested, if one could see Winslow Homer as a pragmatic realist because of his nationality, it was possible to "rescue him from those art historians so tied up with mainstream styles that they could only see the artist as an Impressionist manqu'."" American identity, then, has been a critical foundation on which to base the claims of the legitimacy of American art and American art scholarship. Of course this view of American art as provincial has been substan- tially challenged since Corn wrote her essay. Art history has been questioned from within and without for its formalism, while social histories of art (and, more recently, the encompassing notion of "visual culture") have generated new approaches to the study of art works. Scholarly study of American art has exploded, with opportunities to teach American art expanding and more graduate students trained in the field.12 In other words, American art has been gaining the accoutre- ments of art historical legitimacy. A critique of the narrowness of traditional narratives of American art has been launched that has compelled scholars and curators to consider a more "multicultural" artistic past. The kinds of paradigms identified by Corn over a decade ago would seemingly have been abandoned. Yet, this is not the case. Even the most recent retrospectives of American art scholarship have been tied to the narrative structure used by The American Century. The tenth anniversary volume of American Art, published in the summer of 1997, is a useful case study. American Art's editor asked contributors to look back over the last decade and assess new directions in American art scholarship. Several respondents wrote compellingly about method: about the growth of visual culture studies; about the reconsideration of American art from the perspective of popular culture and other visual media; and about the field's ability to welcome scholars from American studies, cultural studies, and other disciplines. Method, then, was the primary transformation they identified in the last ten years. While method has certainly changed the focus of American art studies, have new methodologies changed the discipline's underlying narrative tropes? Michael Leja, who has published on the Abstract Expressionists, argued that, "As questions concerning the interactions of cultural forms and artistic traditions within a multiethnic and multiracial population have acquired urgency, the United States has assumed new relevance as a focus of art historical inquiry." Implicitly comparing American art to the position traditionally occupied by European art in the academy,</page><page sequence="12">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 731 Leja indicates that American art scholarship can now assert itself on the world stage. A multiethnic, multiracial society, we are the great experiment of the late twentieth century, and the scholar of American art speaks to America's uniqueness as a nation. New art historical methods have simply generated new ways to explore the problem of freedom and democracy created by a "hybrid society." Pluralism, whether in American art or in art historical scholarship (and Leja overlays the two), becomes a signifier of a "decisive expansion"-a phrase oddly resonant with assertions of American power.13 Leja's reinsertion of the trope of American exceptionalism is quite subtle; others, who use the same language and analogies of multiculturalism and new global realities, make the case more overtly. Elizabeth Broun, director of the National Museum of American Art, published a commentary in American Art just this past summer in response to the editor's query about the place of a museum of national art in a world where "multiculturalism and global economics prevail." "The more I work with American art," Broun says, "the more I admire this unique value-set that comprises the 'American democratic experi- ment.' Our national ideal--creating a fair and equal society, with as many freedoms as possible-is a kind of case study for the larger world. Our struggles with competing interests mirror the problems of peoples and nations around the globe." She goes on to insist that, "Today's language about diversity and tolerance is really just a new translation of the idea of 'freedom of expression,' and that seems pretty close to a definition of art."14 Broun, of course, directs a branch of the Smithsonian beholden to a Republican-led Congress that has been highly suspicious of new directions in American art. Yet, her terms mirror those of Leja-and of The American Century. It is very difficult to evade these meta-narratives, especially for readers of American Quarterly who are committed to the project we call American studies. But, let me attempt three alternative readings of the Whitney's exhibition. My aim has been to find themes where nation can be a category (but not the organizing category) and where American art of the last century can be linked to Luce's "American Century," but without its charged claims. The first rereading concen- trates on art in a century where consumer culture has become the most profound shaper of social experience and individual dreams; the second resurrects internationalism in a century where two massive World Wars and global economic reorganization have moved people, goods, and</page><page sequence="13">732 AMERICAN QUARTERLY ideas back and forth across national boundaries; and a final, more eclectic reading imagines an exhibition of art of the twentieth century inspired by Don DeLillo's magnificent novel of postwar America, Underworld. Andy Warhol's celebrity fetish, Elvis I and II (1964), iconizes the consumer and mass-mediated culture of postwar America. Pop artists like Warhol explored both the "seductive glamour" and the "utter banality" of consumer society. In fact, artists have negotiated this tension between fascination and repulsion throughout the century; coming to terms with modem consumption and mass media has been a central interest (and periodic obsession) of twentieth-century art. Arguably, the great revolution of the century has been the communica- tions revolution. In conjunction with a burgeoning consumer culture, it may have been the most significant social and cultural transformation of the past hundred years.15 Andy Warhol has most famously exploited this transformation and The American Century displays not only Elvis I and II but also other of his serialized works: Green Coca-Cola Bottles (1962), Cow Wallpaper (1966), and Brillo Boxes (1964 and 1969). Pop art took images from American mass media and transformed them into a particular kind of commodified art object. Turning to the techniques of mass production, Pop artists used methods like silkscreen transfers to mechanize art making as much as possible. Warhol, always working with a crew of assistants, churned out up to eighty paintings a day in the studio that he dubbed the Factory.16 These artists revealed the perva- siveness of mass-mediated, consumer culture as it became the avenue through which meaning could be made in modem society: even the sacrosanct realms of "art" had been consumed by it. At the same time, they raised postmodern questions about the nature of the meanings produced in a consumer society. Were they merely surface? Were notions of depth, interiority, and identity now irrelevant? Was celebrity, rather than genius, the defining voice in society? In the first half of the twentieth century, artists found consumer culture equally fascinating, but they had little of Warhol's irony. Artists expressed enthusiasm and admiration for the burgeoning world of consumer goods, advertisements, window displays, and flickering screen images. A symbol of modernity and vitality, consumer culture and new forms of commercialized leisure signaled the break with the nineteenth century and the downfall of Victorian stuffiness. Works like William Glackens's The Shoppers (1907) and Florine Stettheimer's</page><page sequence="14">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 733 Spring Sale at Bendel's (1921) commemorated not only the new shopping palaces but also women's visible presence in these public arenas. Others captured the pleasures of urban entertainments- Archibald Motley, Jr. crowded Blues (1929) with dancers, musicians, and instruments while Reginald Marsh documented the seductive lures of the Twenty Cent Movie (1936) even in the height of the Depression. The burgeoning world of advertising attracted artists as well-some like Charles Sheeler and Edward Steichen were employed by advertis- ing agencies while others adapted the graphic style of ads in images that played with the national-brand commodities of modem life. Stuart Davis drew on Cubism for a series of paintings of Lucky Strike cigarette packages, including Lucky Strike (1921), while photographer Ralph Steiner seems to have eerily anticipated Andy Warhol with photographs of billboards and walls of advertisements gridded like Warhol's Coke bottles or Marilyn Monroes (Always Camels and Lollipop [both 1922]). Not everyone enthused about Camel cigarette billboards and night- clubs. To some, the new consumer society represented excessive materialism and spiritual vacuity. Consumer culture and mass media have often been forces to reject, repudiate, critique, and exorcise. Paradoxically, much of the most anti-urban, nature-based, and self- consciously spiritual art of the past century can be understood as part of the dialectic of an encroaching mass, consumer culture. Artists like Georgia O'Keeffe with her New Mexico landscapes, Walker Evans with his photographs of impoverished tenant farmers in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, and Robert Smithson with his monumental earthworks have consistently counterpoised nature, rural life, and an animistic spirituality to the pursuit of profits and goods. The Abstract Expressionists belong in this category. Inspired by myth, they under- stood "action painting" as a humanist gesture. To a certain extent, narrating twentieth-century art through consumer culture decenters the Abstract Expressionists because they appear as reactors to the major problematic of art (rather than innovators). The Abstract Expressionists seem to have intuited that the consumer ethos of Pop Art radically displaced their art because when the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York held a widely popularized show of new Pop artists in the fall of 1962, virtually all of the Abstract Expressionists left the gallery in protest."7 Artists have continued to incorporate and grapple with commodified culture since Pop Art. Conceptual artists, for example, made advertise-</page><page sequence="15">734 AMERICAN QUARTERLY ments, billboards, and magazines vehicles for their work, eschewing galleries, museums, and other traditional venues. Recently, artist Jeff Koons has made sculptures using everyday commodities: New Hoover Convertibles (1981-1987) encased vacuum cleaners in Plexiglas while Rabbit (1986) cast an inflatable bunny in stainless steel. "These oddly displaced items convey Koons' ideas about fantasy, seduction, and desire in the mass marketing of consumer goods. ... Koons has said he creates objects that evoke a world of desire reflected back on itself."18 Video, digital technologies, and the Internet have also been sources for artists in the 1990s as they attempt to comprehend the implications of an increasingly mediated society. A second reinterpretation of The American Century considers the century in terms of internationalism rather than Americanism. The American Century, of course, acknowledges a version of international- ism: Americans copied the innovations of Europe until the advent of the Abstract Expressionists. I want to sidestep sterile formulations of this kind and substitute more circular metaphors. Throughout the century, as people, ideas, and art works have circulated around the world, national traditions have been invented in international settings, with expatriates and immigrants often playing a central role. Even Abstract Expressionists Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko were immigrants, as were Joseph Stella at the beginning of the century and Nam June Paik at the end. Before World War II, artists traveled regularly between the U.S. and Europe, and the travelers were not only Americans. Wanda Corn has called them le type transatlantique.19 Americans Marsden Hartley, Stuart Davis, Man Ray, and Alexander Calder crossed on steamers, as Frenchmen like Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia sailed in the other direction. Duchamp and his European compatriots fell in love with a romance of America-skyscrapers, jazz, the machine, and healthy, robust women-that they carried home with them, often to counter their own bugaboo of a sterile, burdensome European civiliza- tion. American artists living abroad found themselves making Ameri- can art for a French audience with a European-constructed ideal of America as its frame of reference. Gerald Murphy, famed as the model for F. Scott Fitzgerald's Dick Diver in Tender is the Night, lived and painted in France. The French loved his work because he painted things they read as quintessentially American. In Razor (1924) Murphy depicted American exports popular in France-a Gillette safety razor, a</page><page sequence="16">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 735 Parker Duofold fountain pen, and a box of Three Stars matches. Murphy later claimed that, "Although it took place in France, it was all somehow an American experience."20 In Berlin before World War I, Marsden Hartley found German artists obsessed with the mythic American West to the extent that George Grosz set up an Indian teepee in his studio where he and his friends sat and smoked Indian pipes. Hartley himself "felt the urge to paint a series of paintings he called Amerika, based on Indian motifs and the American West, a subject he knew no more intimately than the Germans."21 Louis Lozowick, a Russian who immigrated to the U.S. in 1906 at age fourteen, returned to Berlin after World War I. There he met Russian Constructivists and was also caught up in their romance of America as a land of "gigantic engineering feats and colossal mechanical constructions."22 He ex- ecuted paintings of nine American cities while still in Europe; his Pittsburgh (1922-1923) hung in the Whitney exhibition. These paint- ings were a great success in Berlin, which with its "traffic signals, American cars, Lucky Strikes, Lux and Woolworth Stores" seemed not so very different from New York.23 Murphy's, Hartley's, and Lozowick's reception in Europe muddies any simple dichotomy of metropol and periphery and makes the "Americanness" of such work internationally constructed. Although the art world's center of gravity shifted westward after World War II, internationalism has continued. The Abstract Expres- sionist heroic individual gesture is meaningful only in light of world fears about fascism and totalitarianism and, after the war, of Cold War geopolitics that equated artistic individuality with individual freedom. By the late 1950s, in any case, people, ideas, and art had begun to circulate with new intensity. The GI Bill took artists like Al Held, Ellsworth Kelly, and Sam Francis to Paris.24 Other movements actually left New York for other art centers. George Maciunas, a Lithuanian- born artist living in New York, had organized the first Neo-Dada Fluxus exhibition in 1961; after he moved to Wiesbaden, Germany in 1962, he held annual "Flux Festivals" there which became a "forum where a loose association of artists from France, Germany, Denmark, the United States, Japan, and Korea began to form their Pluxus identity."25 The term Pop Art was applied first to a group of British artists exhibiting in London who recirculated mass-media images, suggesting not a pure American hegemony, but a transnational response to consumer and mass society. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, many</page><page sequence="17">736 AMERICAN QUARTERLY important exhibitions were themselves international with "Neo-Ex- pressionist" Americans Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Eric Fischl, and Susan Rothenberg hanging alongside important Europeans like Sigmar Polke, Georg Baselitz, Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer, and Gerhard Richter. Nan Goldin has more recently documented the same demi- monde she depicted in Ballad of Sexual Dependency with work made during travels in Berlin and Asia. Published simultaneously in Zurich, Berlin, New York, and Japan in 1993, The Other Side compiled photographs of drag queens on all three continents.26 This activity defies not only easy notions of "America Takes Command," but also the belief that artists have consistently made the nation and national experience their reference point. Don DeLillo's expansive novel of post-World War II America, Underworld, prompts a final reinterpretation of The American Century. DeLillo reads American history in the strange coincidences of world events, popular culture, and individual memories. The book opens with a set piece on the famous 1951 Brooklyn Dodgers/New York Giants game, in which the game is won on a last, fateful home run. The novel traces that home run ball's history-from one father's betrayal of his son to another father's gift to his son; from Khe San to a basement in a New Jersey suburb where the game's scoreboard has been lovingly resurrected; and eventually into the hands of Underworld's main character, for whom the ball symbolizes life's losses and the sudden twists of fate. That the main character is a waste analyst who travels around the world giving lectures on waste management, especially nuclear waste management, is no coincidence. The Dodgers and Giants played on the same day in 1951 that the West learned the Soviet Union had exploded its first nuclear bomb. DeLillo weaves layers of experi- ence together-the public and the private, the most banal and the most tragic-to narrate a history of postwar America. In the book, the underworld is the cast off detritus of society and of memory that simmers below the surface (in literal pits and garbage dumps, but also in the psyche). But, as DeLillo implies, in this simmering refuse lies history. Lucky Strike cigarettes are a recurring symbol in the book; they are the cigarettes smoked by the main character's lost father, the source for the throwaway jingle ("Be happy-go Lucky") and the nostalgic sign of an earlier era in the jazzy target on the package.27 Out of this accumulation of memory, nostalgia, and throwaway consumer culture, Underworld constructs history.</page><page sequence="18">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 737 DeLillo's history runs counter to that of Andy Warhol's slickest pop culture images in which all is opaque surface and managed image. Those surfaces do appear in the novel, but they don't evade depth in the same way. A billboard above the overpasses and elevated railways of the South Bronx mesmerizes the community in the final pages of the novel. Gazing at an ad for Minute Maid orange juice, they see the face of a young girl who has been tragically killed. Is it a miracle? Or is it merely the papered-over previous ad? The novel suggests that both are possible. History might be images made by the media, and the history made by people gathered on concrete islands in the middle of high- ways, but it will also always be operating below and outside the radar of TV, newspapers, and advertisers. History in Underworld ignores the meta-narratives The American Century embraces. The kind of multicultural pluralism where identity, read as race or gender or nation, drives history, simply does not figure. DeLillo creates history from layered accretion, almost in montage, a kind of cinematic epistemology that marks this book unmistakably as a twentieth-century work. The American Century could be retold as such a history of cinematic juxtaposition by hanging works and objects together that the exhibition resolutely dissociates with its enumeration of movements and stylistic trajectories. Three works made in the 1950s, Robert Rauschenberg's Satellite (1955), Louise Nevelson's Dawn's Wedding Chapel, II (1959), and Mark Rothko's Four Darks in Red (1958), are much like DeLillo's underworld. Rauschenberg and Nevelson fill their works with found objects and nostalgic detritus. Overlaid onto these collected objects, the artists invoke world history-the satellite of the Space Age and Cold War competition-and baby boom obsession-the high marriage and birth rate of the postwar years. Next to Rothko's purified, floating colors, the two works appear busy. Yet, the bloody red, apocalyptic landscape with dark, cloud-filled horizon that Rothko evokes echoes Rauschenberg's threatening satellite and contrasts compellingly, yet uneasily, with the wedding-dress ivory of Nevelson's sculpture, just as Cold War and domesticity never fell easily in line together. Other constellations could be created: Eric Fischl's suburban dystopia in Birthday Boy (1983), with a nude boy and woman lying on a rumpled bed; Miriam Schapiro's and Sherry Brody's feminist statement, The Doll House (1972), with one room a miniature studio containing a cloth-doll male nude wearing boots; and William Eggleston's eerie color photograph Algiers, Louisiana (c. 1972), with a dog drinking</page><page sequence="19">738 AMERICAN QUARTERLY from a puddle along some anonymous suburban byway. These three works intimate the simultaneously alienating and volatile sexual dy- namics produced by the postwar enthrallment with suburbia and domesticity. Other moments of insight into the second half of the century might have come from layering the contextual "cultural sites" with the official art. Romare Bearden's Watching the Good Trains Go By (1964) seems more searing hung near the cultural site that has pivotal events of 1968-including Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination-replayed on a 1960s' portable TV in a faux bachelor pad. Depicting a memory from his own childhood in the South, Bearden used photomontage, "combin[ing] public images from the media with the narratives of personal memories."28 The work of art and the television in its pad offer strangely reflexive collations of memory about the 1960s. Some works convey the more sordid undersides of postwar experience, such as Larry Clark's Untitled, from the portfolio Tulsa (1972), a photograph of two naked women and a man shooting up; Cindy Sherman's recent photographs "which construct hybrid figures from body parts, props, and prostheses"; and Philip Guston's Cabal (1977) in which a cartoon- like, personal lexicon of anthropomorphic figures with bulging eyes crowd a blood red and black landscape, invoking at once Guston's own earlier works of hooded Ku Klux Klan members and a more apocalyp- tic vision.29 These three works belong to different artistic movements and different decades. Within the Whitney's linear model, they can't be conceptualized together, yet as a set of images of bodies disfigured by modem existence, they suggest the close connections between desire, self-destruction and self-manufacture. The metaphor of underworld could be applied to the first half of the century as well. George Bellows's Pennsylvania Station Excavation (1909) might, like the landfills and waste pits in Underworld, symbol- ize the underground history of the century, but more common than excavations in the first fifty years of the century were pictures of the new industrial landscape. Charles Sheeler painted Classic Landscape (1931) after photographing the Ford Motor Company's Rouge River complex for the advertising agency N. W. Ayer and Company. The plant covered eleven hundred acres, employed 75,000 people, and included ninety-three miles of railroad track.30 The painting fixes the plant, like a frieze; yet if set beside Morton Schamburg and Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven's collaboration, God (1917), a readymade</page><page sequence="20">MAKING SENSE OF AMERICA 739 assemblage of plumbing pipes, its pretensions seem both less heroic and less stable. Moreover, if Classic Landscape is populated, say by Alvin Langdon Coburn's photographed Tunnel Builders (1909), its sterility belies the human beings disciplined by the plant's industrial geometry and work routines. The exhibition also segregates art of the "consumer culture" of the 1920s from "political art," but if imagined together, Ben Shahn's political statement about the betrayals of Ameri- can society in The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti (1931-1932) reverber- ates with the personal betrayals experienced by the motionless woman frozen (like Sheeler's Classic Landscape perhaps?) in her opera box in Guy Pane du Bois's 1926 painting, Opera Box. Another pair of paintings, on the theme of the Chinese restaurant, speaks to different kinds of historical memory. Max Weber's Chinese Restaurant (1915), originally entitled Memory of a Chinese Restaurant, uses Cubism to make a "Memory Picture of the essence of China-Town," following the suggestion of his friend Alvin Langdon Coburn.31 Weber's red walls, checkered floors, and broken-up faces are a cool, jazzy memory quite unlike Edward Hopper's static, silent Chop Suey (1929). Here two women sit, encased in their own private reveries while a shocking red sign with blue lights flashes outside. It's not just that these two paintings suggest contradictions in modem American culture. Cer- tainly, they do that. But, as a pair of meditations on a new modem phenomenon-ethnic dining-the works indicate how popular culture can cling to memory, and together with memory, can shape history. Don DeLillo's imaginary underworld may still not be the perfect way to connect and present art produced in twentieth-century America, but its more cinematic view of history refutes the easy, topical organization the Whitney chose. A show shaped by montage might have invited viewers to make sense of America through a complex brew of private memory, personal relationships born in suburbia, mass- mediated culture, and industrial and post-industrial work. Perhaps none of the three alternative exhibitions I have hypothesized would have successfully managed the more than twelve hundred works in The American Century. But, by looking through the prisms of consumer culture, internationalism, or underworld, the Whitney might well have better fulfilled its best intentions. By juxtaposing the Brooklyn Dodgers and Joseph Stella's modernist Brooklyn Bridge (on an advertising billboard no less), someone at the Whitney intuited- and possibly sought-a different meaning for the show than the</page><page sequence="21">740 AMERICAN QUARTERLY curators created. Stella's modernist painting and the canon it symbol- izes cannot alone make "sense of America." NOTES 1.
