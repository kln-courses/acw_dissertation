<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elephants and Compassion: Ecological Criticism and Southern African Hunting Literature Dan Wylie Why, at the recent congress of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), did a Greenpeace worker break down in tears when the elephant was removed from Appendix 1, so reopening limited trade in ivory? When Councillor Mushangwe, of Zimbabwe's Muzarabani District Council (beneficiary of a CAMPHRE project), said, "We like our elephants, but we hate the damage they cause," what exactly did he mean by "like," so much more elusive an emotion than that specific "hate"?1 Why does Fidelity Bank, in a recent advertisement, use the elephant as a symbol of matriarchal strength and caring wisdom?2 What is the emotional genealogy of the recent furore over the fate of thirty young elephants 'kidnapped' from Tuli?3 What role has literature played in forming such attitudes towards a creature which is, arguably, the most potent animal symbol of Africanness and a 'flagship' icon of recent ecological movements and debates? Most broadly and contentiously, what role could, or even should, literature play in defining attitudes towards our environment? Literary studies in southern Africa have scarcely begun to make connections with what is easily the central, ecological crisis of our times (but see Bell; Meintjies; Martin). In exploring the field, a focus on elephants is particularly revealing: the elephant has always been (for obvious reasons) the most prominent animal on the continent, and subject to the most intense literary reactions. These run the gamut from a seductive and awestruck enmity, increasingly through 'morally considerable' to, today, 'morally significant,' the symbolic and practical centre of many conservation efforts. Because many of the National Parks were formed around elephant herds, and have now become overpopulated by them, their situation focusses the wider debates concerning land use, economic exploitation, animal rights and the variable constructions of 'culture' and 'nature.' Most usefully, there exists a English in Africa 28 No. 2 (October 2001): 79-100</page><page sequence="2">80 DAN WYLIE massive literature, from nineteenth-century hunting accounts through to popular fiction, an extensive children's literature, the discourses of adver- tising, the emerging genre of coffee-table eulogies, and the quasi-scientific wildlife magazine industry. In particular, nineteenth-century hunting accounts lie at a salient, transitional point in which shifting attitudes and debates are rhetorically particularly interesting. In short, elephants have become symbolic in various ways, an 'imaginary' through and against which at least some humans define themselves and their place: "The elephant today embodies wild Africa as never before" (Walker 145). On the one hand, elephants already had a symbolic life in the European mind, long before actual encounters became more frequent; and on the other, even for most southern Africans, they remain symbols, literary or pictorial 'simulacra,' rather than animals available to physical encounter. It is the role of these symbolic presences, the rhetorics by which those presences are shaped, and the ways in which they articulate with people's behaviour towards wildlife, in which I am particularly interested. In other words, I want to ask certain questions about the role of 'criticism' in the term 'eco-criticism' or 'ecological criticism.'4 II There seem to be as many eco-critical theories as there are theorists, the field both continuously shifting and tirelessly eclectic. I will not attempt yet another definition here, and want to express only the reservation that in at least two ways the term seems paradoxical. Firstly, as Karl Kroeber has rightly pointed out (25), the methodology of scientific ecology cannot be applied in any direct way to the evaluation of literature. This is true even if we attempt to erase the boundary between Nature and Culture, either through a radically behaviourist model ("We are only organisms like any other, and our cultural products are really 'natural' evolutionary responses"), or a radically "Deep Ecology" model ("We need to allow our illusory 'selves' to be reabsorbed into Nature"). The models themselves always stand outside any such absorption or transcendence. Secondly, the 'ecological' part seems in practice to be profoundly ethical in nature, addressing the obvious need to get human beings to behave in a more responsible and responsive manner towards the environment. I fully support that fundamental aim. However, 'criticism' surely means more than merely endorsing what appears to support the fashionable ethic of the day, and deploring what doesn't. Most 'eco-criticism' I have read does precisely this - often illuminatingly, but also running the danger of</page><page sequence="3">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 8 1 tautologically seeking out only that material which bolsters its own preconceptions (see e.g. Taplin). Is it enough to aver that part of the method- ology is to be continually reassessing one's stance, since ecological principles themselves maintain that change is perpetual? Perhaps. I still find myself running into a problem analogous to that experienced by National Park wardens: a kind of managerial problem. What - since as far as I can see 'ecocriticism' has no methods it can call its own - does an 'ecocritic' do with literature that clearly affects the ecology, but doesn't conform to present-day ecological wisdoms? Just 'shooting it,' like a rogue elephant, as repellent or irrelevant, is clearly inadequate. At the same time, to pretend some kind of 'objective,' ethically neutral stance is, as Bakhtin and Wayne Booth have taught us, fundamentally impossible. An eco-critical approach has somehow to regard such works as nevertheless integral to the overall unity of the 'literary eco-systems' of their time: "the situation of exploit- ation of nature exemplifies such unity equally well as a conserver situation" (Plumwood 149). The nineteenth-century hunting accounts sharpen the problematic involved in questioning the conventional divide between Nature and Culture and between 'understanding' and 'activism.' In looking at that literature, ecological philosophy is gazing into the entrails of its own provenance - with some disturbing results. It is to realise that, insofar as any concept- ualisation of 'the world out there' is structured in language and in culturally- determined iconographies, 'Nature' is a cultural artefact, or as Neil Evernden puts it, "a social entity, evolving steadily and thus not a stable frame for environmental discussion" (Howarth 85). Few eco-critics have fully explored the wrinkle that an avowedly eco-centric, as opposed to anthro pocentric approach, has a certain difficulty escaping the fact that every "human attempt to know the phenomenal world is filtered through a human value system" and its languages (McDowell 386). Even the most imaginative writing is necessarily the inheritor of precursor discourses, and therefore at best an ambivalent bearer of any self-critique. In short, an ecologically orientated criticism is torn between the nec- essary but limited task of 'objectively' recontextualising literature amongst and against the scientific paradigms and environmental develop-ments of its day; and an admirable but also potentially limiting, if not arrogant, extraction of 'good' or 'bad' points according to its current ethical 'correctness.' (This is in some ways analogous to what happens in some varieties of feminist criticism.) If there is a bridge, it is perhaps in the study of the rhetorics themselves, in the ways in which the works as artefacts help structure our perceptions of those contexts and symbolise our own ethical choices. It is</page><page sequence="4">82 DAN WYUE only with this firmly at the centre of the equation, I suspect, that "a recognition of interdependence and relationship," acknowledging "both continuity and difference" (Plumwood 156), can lead to a coherent 'ecological criticism.' Relationship is symbolic. The issue can be further refracted through Karl Kroeber's wonderfully challenging but still problematic book Ecological Literary Criticism, a work studying romantic poetry - a literature about as antithetical to the flattened prose of the only slightly later hunting accounts as one can encounter. I would agree, with Kroeber, that it is "high time . . . that humanists again take up their responsibilities as informed students and commentators on the dynamics of humankind's relationship with the natural world" (142). There is in that very sentence, however, a reversion to a division between culture and nature, precisely what he wishes to question. But every statement of intent is necessarily a step back into * culture/ What Kroeber's investigation actually shows, if I read him right, is that the Romantics' attack on the culture-nature dichotomy is in some sense doomed to failure. I agree also with Kroeber's view that literature can no longer divorce itself artificially from contemporary scientific paradigms. At the same time, Kroeber's point that scientific paradigms are historical, and need to be constantly historicised, means that the ethic attached to scientific ecology now is also historically contingent and mutable - but there is a strong sense in Kroeber's book that he has a rather more normative, if not absolutist, ethical standard in mind. This is implicit in his valorisation of 'poetry' as a paradigmatically assimilative, 'imaginative' medium for an ecological consciousness. What does an ecological criticism then do with environ- mentally implicated prose works which eulogise uncaring violence towards (say) elephants, but are no less works of the imagination - other than dismiss them? That Kroeber would like to do just this is implicit in his statement that ecological thinking requires "the shaping of emotional attitudes, the strengthening of particular kinds of imagining, and the accepting of certain ethical commitments" (152; my emphasis). What would those "particular kinds" be? A kind, presumably, that envisions a 'felicitous' interaction of human and natural, as propounded by the Romantics. The Romantic view (proposed, it has to be said, in the absence of charging elephants and venomous cobras) is diametrically opposed to that evident in nineteenth-century hunting accounts. Yet Kroeber wants to go so far as to assert that this 'felicitousness' must necessarily include a vulnerability to pain - a necessary corollary of the assimilation of culture to nature. Our sense of "any vitally encompassing wholeness" must be such as</page><page sequence="5">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 83 to encompass "subordinate differentiations, even incompatibilities" (56). But are ethically-repellent, "irresponsible" elephant-hunting accounts not then an acceptable "incompatibility"? Or do they somehow lie outside the "wholeness"? The short answer is that it depends on what kind of wholeness you envisage. Kroeber is clearly aware of this: "The unity of an ecosystem, after all, is not something sensorily perceptible .... [T]he romantics empha- sized the importance of complex integral unities of being whose wholeness could only be imagined" (58). If a felicitous kind of imagining, as Kroeber asserts, doesn't lead towards a realpolitik, what hope for his ethical stand? If it is a mode of imagining to be valorised over other modes, what happens to its avowed respect for diversity and its avoidance of a "narrow political partisanship" (56)? Kroeber rightly notes that there are no easy answers; there is no "metanature, divine or otherwise" to which to appeal. "We are, he adds, "natural creatures" (104). I think it is possible to envisage our 'cultures' as being within 'nature' (Gaia, if you like); but this reemphasises the fact that these 'cultures' are as much imagined wholes as ecological wholes are, and that the ethical stances based on those imaginaries are, as Mark Johnson (1993) has argued, fundamentally metaphoric in nature. The hunters' (Samuel) Johnsonian response, doubtless, would be, "Try getting charged by an elephant, and see how metaphorical that is." But when it comes to the effects of literature, including on the hunters themselves, there seems to me no way not to separate ourselves, at a point inherently symbolic, from 'nature.' It is to that point which the 'criticism' part of 'ecocriticism' applies itself. Ill In short, an ecologically-oriented criticism pursues some satisfactory triangulation of the dynamics of: a) observed social, scientific, and environmental contexts; b) a stylistically or aesthetically based criticism of literary works being produced within those contexts; and c) an ethical standpoint which is neither narrowly sectarian and masking of the complexities of the works themselves, nor disengaged from the real-world effects of the works. Firstly, and extremely briefly, some necessary contextualisations. On the one hand, my own attitude towards elephants has been formed by a complex intersection of having been raised by a naturalist, numerous encounters with actual elephants, and fairly extensive reading in fiction and popular wildlife literature. Some of the intellectual provenance of this nexus can be amplified by researching the wealth of sophisticated philosophical writing on the</page><page sequence="6">84 DAN WYLIE history of animal rights (Clark 16-30; Singer; Elliott), on 'Nature' generally in mainstream philosophy (Gruen &amp; Jamieson; Macauley), on wilderness philosophy (Sessions), and on the man-beast debate (Midgely; Ham). But there's a caveat here: my own attitudes were (until now) not directly formed by such work; their origins are popularised rehashings, oral transmissions, piecemeal and, probably, ultimately untraceable. This will likely be the same for any other writer one decides to study. On the other hand, then, the attempt to contextualise chosen elephant- hunting accounts is fraught with difficulties. However, a start can be made by looking at least at the following, often overlapping, aspects, all of which offer rich prospects for further study: 1. The actual impact of hunting on the elephants. The near-exter- mination of elephant happened alongside the very definite extermination of other species, as well as history's most dynamic, intercontinental exchange of sundry animals and plants (Crosby). One problem here is that the hunting accounts are themselves part of the evidence, coloured by their own agendas. 2. The evolution of attitudes towards animals in general. This would include the advent of animal protection organisations, from the RSPCA in Britain in 1824 to Greenpeace (1970) and the Rhino &amp; Elephant Foundation. One aspect of this is the sometimes tricky distinction between wild and domestic (see Serpell; Thomas). The African elephant, contrary to popular conceptions, has been domesticated both in Africa and in the West, but had by the period of major colonisation lost its domestic history; it became iconic of the untameable enormity of Africa itself - witness how many accounts mention the elephant's 'Africa-shaped' ears (eg. Meadows 409). Very real consequences for the elephants and their environments ensued from this largely imaginary perception. Nevertheless, even as hunters regularly valorised the elephant's wild dangerousness, they speculated on its domestic potential. In 1896 Parker Gillmore found it necessary to trumpet that allegations of their untameability were "stuff and nonsense" (64). Most elephants now find themselves in a median position, as Richard Carrington predicted in 1958, as "semi-domestic herds in the artificially-created national parks" (61). 3. The successive scientific models of the wild, from early Darwinist, through conservationist and 'deep ecology' to the 'sustainable devel- opment' and 'biodiversity' models. From early on, hunters of elephants became involved in a gauchely scientific and educative process of supplying</page><page sequence="7">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 85 with 'specimens' - only with difficulty distinguishable from 'trophies' - an emergent European museum culture and the attendant institutionalisation of various zoological sciences (see MacKenzie, Empire of Nature). While the process of 'collection' was itself appallingly destructive, it also formed the nucleus of those very studies through which more compassionate, less murderous modes of relating to wild creatures would be formed. There's a certain disingenuousness in H. Anderson Bryden's judgement, while lament- ing the "decadence of great game" in 1 897, that Whatever damage he may have done in early years among the elephants, the magnificent specimens of great game sent home by [Frederick Courteney] Selous to the Natural History and other Museums, amply deliver him from the charge of mere wasteful slaughter. (300) Here, the language and practice of 'science' acts as a rhetorical shield for the emotional undercurrents and ethical countercurrents - and this is often as true of the present-day conservation lobby as it was of the early hunters' faunicidal brotherhood. These writers frequently had difficulty parsing Objective scientific observation' from their enthusiasm for killing. Even where the hunter's account is divided into personal narrative and appended 'natural history' notes - a kind of display-cabinet closure the development of the genre increasingly required - those notes, as in Kirby's Sport in Central Africa (1899), are often given over to notes for the prospective hunter. This kind of 'science' is both instrumental to hunting, and an educative spinoff of it. Similarly, the rhetorics of science and emotional satisfaction are inextricably entwined in this self-aware (and audience- aware) paragraph of Selous' s (a postmortem in more ways than one): Upon cutting out this elephant's heart I found that three bullets had gone clean through it, and that a fourth was still in it, whilst his lungs were riddled. I laid the heart upon the carcase, and made a drawing of it on the spot, showing the position of the four bullet- holes on the one side. This statement will, I am afraid, be looked upon with suspicion by the generality of my readers, though all those who have shot much large game will probably be able to call to mind similar experiences. (Travel 476) Recent writings on the ivory trade and the culling debate often utilise a related antithesis of the 'objective' participant against 'sentimental' or 'emotional' activists, e.g.: "The anti-ivory trade movement has so capital-</page><page sequence="8">86 DAN WYLIE ised on emotional concerns that it has lost sight of the other real threat to elephants: human expansion" (Walker 78-79). 4. The literary iconographies of elephants preceding the works under review. The ambivalence of southern African hunters' expressions of antipathy or empathy are inheritors of the elephant's long iconographie history in the Christian West, involving all the hoary legends of elephants' prodigious memories, martial history, strength, and 'sagacity' (the reach of this 'simulacrum' is particularly evident in advertisements). 5. The growth of capitalistic enterprise in Africa, and elephants' place in the global economy. Ivory was always, and continues to be, the primary motive behind the hunting of elephants; but it is now also economically integrated through tourism - and in some places, the controlled 'cull.' The rhetorics of economics are thus particularly important. 6. The confluence of war on elephants with war on indigenous human societies. Elephant-hunting, like the conflict waged with the Xhosa, the Zulu or the Shona, was conducted as, and often expressed as, a war. The hunter's typically sedulous pursuit of the physiology of bullet-tracks (like Selous's above), or of the tortuous manoeuvres preceding each killing, resembles nothing so much as the battle descriptions of a soldier like, say, Heinz Guderian: I radioed Liebenstein to instruct XXIV Panzer Corps that SS-Das Reich be sent south to the River Udai, between Kustovy and Perevolochnice, and thence be directed on Ssrebnoie-Bereskova in conjunction with the 4th Panzer Division . . . (Guderian 219) At the same time, war has often acted as cover and pretext for elephant- poaching (see Ellis; Potgieter). 7. The self-definitions of imperialist European society, its racial and technological power, its masculinities,5 etc. The hunter's self-image as meat- supplier or as protector of the hapless natives from predatory pachyderms, for instance, is métonymie of wider attitudes of imperialist patronage. The hunters were the pioneers who inaugurated that patronage: "Th[e hunters'] cacoethes venandi has urged many and many an Englishman to the uttermost parts of the earth, and has aided not a little in the opening up of new countries" (Bryden 283). So a "natural and apparently irrepressible instinct" (281) is said to have its civilising benefits. Moreover, as Bryden put</page><page sequence="9">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 87 it, "The wonderful courage and energy of the early hunters contributed also, in a very great degree, to the respect and admiration in which the Englishman has been held by the black man. In nearly every instance these early explorers were men of perfect truth, honesty and fairness . . ." (301). This is the image of the archetypal hero of subsequent popular fiction, too, who maintains similar lineaments whether he is hunting elephants or protecting them. 8. The articulation of national parks and wilderness-area philosophies with wider patterns of land distribution (see Beinart &amp; Coates; Bunn; Carruthers; MacKenzie, Empire of Nature, "Natural World"; Neumann). How readily, for instance, the account of the hunt modulates into that of the 'progress of civilisation,' as it does in Selous's Travel and Adventure in South-East Africa (1893). Clr Mushangwe's conception of "damage," cited earlier, is inexplicable without this history. Hence, in South Africa, the eventual articulation of national park strategies with the demographics of apartheid: as Jane Carruthers argues, national parks' "disadvantages, particularly in terms of their explicit repudiation of a human element, are catching up with them" (126). There have even been calls for South African conservationists to testify before a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.6 9. Wider developments in aesthetics and narratological discourse. Travelogues, of which hunting accounts are a sub-species, alter over the long term from the laconic, unabashedly interventionist hero-narratives of the nineteenth century, to the self-effacing, voyeuristic, sympathetic fascinations of the tourist era: from gun to camera, in short. Semi-scientific coffee-table books on elephants now constitute a veritable genre of their own. All these, and others, interlock in infinitely variable ways with the practice of rhetorical choices in literary works, both reflecting and constituting the ethical standpoints of writers and readers. The ethics of the hunt, of particular kinds of hunting, of the justifications for compassion or pragmatic violence, are everywhere contested. As in the case of London Zoo's "Jumbo," who was sold to P. T. Barnum in 1882 to an outcry of anthropomorphic lament, there were occasional spasms of sympathy (Carrington 209-10). But the same people who protested the departure of "Jumbo" were flocking in ever-greater numbers to buy the piano-keys and billiard-balls made from other elephants' tusks, and to read the hunters' accounts of how they shot them. At the same time, glimmers of anthro- pomorphic identification glint through the dreary 'othering' that governs the nineteenth-century hunting account: this happens particularly when orphaned</page><page sequence="10">88 DAN WYLIE baby elephants are involved (see e.g. Selous, Wanderings 142; Travel 179; Delegorgue II, 26; Finaughty 1861). Growing compassion for elephants can be mapped most clearly through this metaphor of the family, which reaches its peak when Oria Hamilton, studying elephants in east Africa, claimed to have learned a thing or two from them about mothering her own child.7 The image of the tenderly supportive elephant family is now a centrepiece of the soberest scientific accounts, and governs the actual mechanics of elephant- culling operations. The crucial realisation is not that such different attitudes could co-exist within the same culture, but that they had to. They were interdependent: not a few nineteenth-century genteel refinements, educational opportunities, scientific studies and technological advances by which British society was becoming increasingly defined, all depended in vital ways for their very existence on the brutality of the hunt. It was one of the functions of those nineteenth-century hunting accounts which "glided effortlessly into print" (Beinart &amp; Coates 25), paradoxically to mask and to display the brutality. And it may be that current ecological fervour is no less compromised by its literary doppelgängers, actually requiring them in order to exist at all. IV In describing how some of these interlocking, interdependent contexts inflect examples from the heyday of southern African elephant-hunting in the late nineteenth century, I want to stress only a couple of possibly obvious points: that these works' stylistic gestures are inseparable from the imagining of ethical wholes; that those ethics are established only in counterpoint to others; and that the counterpointing of rhetorics in these nineteenth-century works constitutes the present-day debate over land, identity, and the right to kill in its very genesis. Understanding the mutually constitutive interplay of rhetorics and ethics as a particular generic style and culture develops, might offer some useful insights into our own use of rhetorics, our own culture of ethics. As Stephen Gray has pointed out in his sometimes waywardly entertaining chapter, "The Rise and Fall of the Colonial Hunter" (93-132), the nineteenth-century hunter-writers were, all protestations to the contrary, intensely aware of their literary techniques. The coy admission of clumsiness was one of their literary techniques. They wrote out of, and against, literary antecedents both without and, increasingly, within the hunting genre, with a keen sense of the alterity of their largely non-hunting audience. So Selous is</page><page sequence="11">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 89 careful to relate how he carries around his volume of Byron (Wanderings 71), and longs for a copy of his favourite novelist: having reached a hill named "by the natives Tchakari," - This name I altered to Mount Thackeray, as a tribute to the memory of the immortal novelist, whose genius has so often enabled me to escape, for the time being, from my surroundings; to forget the filthy, sordid, mean and vermin-swarming savages amongst whom I actually was, and to live again, in spirit at least, amongst the dwellers in Vanity Fair (Travel 287) The "plain, intelligible English" for which Selous claims to strive is, however, designed to take one as far from Thackeray as possible: it partly reflects savagery; indeed, the savages themselves are partly responsible: If I have not succeeded as well as I would wish, I trust that my shortcomings will be leniently judged when it is remembered that the last nine years of my life have been passed amongst savages, during which time I have not undergone the best training for a literary effort. (Wanderings ix) The style is developed only in contradistinction to another: here Selous relates a sticky position through another fictional lens: A solitary Englishman, alone in Central Africa, in the middle of a hostile country, without blankets or anything else but what he stood in, and a rifle with four cartridges. I doubt whether Mark Tapley himself would have seen anything cheerful in the situation. (Travel 223) While borrowing some of that character's breezy determination "to 'come out strong' under disadvantageous circumstances" (Dickens 250), Selous avoids entirely Tapley' s dog-like devotion to his chosen master, as well as the tone of archly sympathetic satire which governs Martin Chuzzlewit. Selous' s avowed literary models, of course, are his predecessor-hunters. He might demur from their opinions about how best to bag an elephant, but he is devoted to the example of "Gordon Cumming, Baldwin and other authors" whose works "had quite captivated my imagination, and done much to determine me to adopt the [hunter's] life of ever- vary ing scenes and constant excitement" (Travel 1). It is surely in part the very flatness, the suppression of feeling (beyond such clichés as "constant excitement") which</page><page sequence="12">90 DAN WYLIE allowed that particular order of imagination, a coherently 'contrapoetic' (but not necessarily antipoetìc) one, to do its seductive work. To the task of re- telling the adventure Selous is therefore also devoted; it is an inseparable part of the thrill: I soon had a piece of elephant's heart, nicely salted and peppered, roasting on a forked stick over the coals; and if I had but had a white companion with whom to talk over the day's sport and fight the battle o'er again, my happiness would have been complete. (69) The literariness of that phrase "fight the battle o'er again" reemphasises the troubling but necessary presence of the poetic "reader in the text." A present- day hunter, David P. Prizio, has put this narrative imperative more explicitly: "The hunt itself may be the least important and least gratifying phase of the sport, without the equally gratifying anticipation and recollection to complete the experience." Storytelling is crucial even before the stalk begins (and whose stories structure Prizio' s anticipation but that same geneaology of "Baldwin, Bell, Lyell, Manners, Stigand, Selous, Pretorius and Finaughty"?): [In the anticipation phase, y]our imagination is your guide. You are in control. During the recollection stage, you are blessed with the gift that erases the bad memories and enhances the good ones, allowing the story to mature and improve much like fine Bourdeaux wine. Reality is the root of the realisation phase, however. It comes on someone else's terms, and you must tackle it with storybook imagination or selective memory. (Sanchez-Arino 350) In Prizio' s own account, and in common with most of his predecessors', the actual killing of the elephant is dismissed in two lines. The simile of the "fine Bourdeaux wine" also reminds us that this hunting genre, with some exceptions, is a literature of inherited clichés and normative generalities. A detail like Selous' s - "This time I placed the muzzle within an inch of the skin, and the smoke of the powder came curling out of the hole in a thin blue wreath" {Wanderings 153) - is a novelistic deviation from the norm of a diary-like telegraphese (indeed, this quotation is part of an explicitly expanded, retrospectively embellished version of a brief diary entry). That style ω the hunter's identity - summed up by Edward Tabler as of "a brave man, a good shot, a capable roughrider, a practical naturalist, botanist,</page><page sequence="13">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 91 geographer, and something of a physician" (cited in Sanchez-Arino 3). Not a writer. The style also serves to distinguish the writer from the non-European modes of celebrating the hunt, Selous's view of which is again refracted through his reading: [T]hen the whole day's sport was gone through [by Selous's 'boys'] in pantomime; and all the while they sang wild songs, some extemporaneously in praise of their own and my prowess as hunters, while others were the old standard songs of their country, of which there is a large stock. Altogether it was a wild and interesting scene, and their naked figures and wild gestures, now brought into strong relief against the dark background, and anon but dimly seen in the uncertain light of the large log fires, recalled vividly to my mind the pictures, in an old book at home of Captain Cook's voyages, of the South Sea Islanders dancing round the fire during the preparation of a savoury meal of human flesh. (Wanderings 70) If Selous suffers any shiver of apprehension here, it is immediately dismissed with a patronising wave: "As ... a little licence must always be allowed after a successful day's hunt, I let them have their fling" (70). We can only 'criticise,' of course, literary hunters: as Bryden pointed out in 1 897 (294), for every published European hunter, there were dozens of even more rapacious 'gunners' who have disappeared among the bushes of history. In crucial respects, then, these works conceal what was actually happening; they efface history. Like many other forms of popular literature, they existed to make the slaughter safe and justifiable even as it exposed it. For the hunter-writers were fully aware of the moral dimensions of their slaughter. No elephant-hunting account is free of the subliminal voices of ethical opposition; the debate between utilitarian power and aesthetic respect - and their rhetorics - was already fully developed. In 1847 Adulphe Delegorgue asks: "What paltry reason can justify the death and destruction of such beautiful, strong and excellent animals?" But his stab of conscience doesn't envisage leaving the elephants in peace: "What are a couple of hundred pounds of ivory," he continues, "compared with the long service which such animals might render to man for generations?" And in the next sentence, the basic addiction reasserts itself: "I was perfectly conscious of the mischief I was doing but I was a hunter first and foremost" (II, 3-4). The need to assert a predetermined identity prevails -</page><page sequence="14">92 DAN WYLIE and that predetermination is in large part literary. This rhetorical pattern recurs repeatedly (see Baker 57). In 1881, Selous exults momentarily in the "grand sight" of so many of these huge beasts moving slowly and majestically onwards. However, as there was now but an hour of sunlight left, we could spare but little time for admiration, and so rode towards them, on murderous thoughts intent. (Wanderings 337) The vocabulary of awe seldom goes further than "grand" or "majestic" or "sublime." The word "murderous" of course evinces the edge of com- passionate self-criticism, but it is contained within the transgressive excitement of a particular power-relationship, that of diminutive bullet overcoming elephantine bulk: David defeating Goliath. Repeatedly hunters, from Delegorgue to the most recent, express "wonder that such a comparatively small missile as a .458 bullet could so easily kill the unden- iable ruler of the animal kingdom" (Westley 14). (I speculate that the brevity of description of the death itself can be related to the kind of technology in use; it's interestingly contrasted to the lingering, gory mode of popular fiction, from Mayne Reid to Wilbur Smith, a much more voyeuristic treatment.) And it's the uniqueness of this possibility - the "true monarch of the African forest . . . slain by the only living thing that could wreak him harm - ruthless man" (Selous, Wanderings 75) - that fuels the intoxicating excitement, described in virtually every account in the most pallid and conventional of prose. Indeed, the impulse of most of these hunters is to suppress feeling, whether of blood-lust or of aesthetic appreciation: sentiment requires the facility of the poet, to which the practical hunter engaged in 'work' (an even more pervasive metaphor for slaughter than war) had better not aspire: The occurrences that happened today require a better pen than mine to give even a slight impression of them. The whole picture is so vast, made up of the great beasts with their trunks and ears swinging ever to and fro, and the huge forest with its mighty trees and glorious vegetation, and the contrast of the tiny little human being amongst it all is so great that I feel it is really hopeless for a person to try and picture it .... I will therefore leave my own feelings at once, and . . . continue the facts of the diary. (William Tapp, 1914, in Sanchez-Arino 82-83) There seems a pervasive attempt to excise metaphor, which, as Northrop Frye says, evinces "a desire to associate, and finally to identify, the human mind with what goes on outside it ... when you feel that although we may</page><page sequence="15">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 93 know in part ... we are also a part of what we know" (cited by Evernden 101). Superficially, these clichéd spasms of admiration help mitigate the murderousness, in association with a certain nostalgia for the crumbling 'sublime'; even the earlier nineteenth-century accounts express regret at the falling numbers of murderable game, more so by Selous's time. But the nostalgia fuels not a reduction in killing, or even an open admission that the hunter himself feels responsible, but simply killing's replacement by other forms of commerce. So Selous: [F]rom the beginning of 1882 to the end of 1887, 1 was principally engaged in collecting specimens of the magnificent fauna which was once abundant throughout the land, but many forms of which are day by day becoming scarcer whilst some, alas! are already verging upon extinction . . . (Travel vii) But he envisages, in virtually the next breath, "mining centres" which "will support a large farming population . . . till at no distant date the homesteads of British and South African settlers will be scattered throughout the length and breadth of the breezy downs of Mashunaland" (viii). Lest his attitude be in any doubt: "That I may yet live to see [Mashonaland] become a rich and prosperous portion of the British Empire, is my most earnest desire" (ix). The air of nostalgia, in short, is part of the equipment of power; indeed is a literary demonstration of it. Similarly, in 1896, Parker Gillmore, in a section of his Leaves from a Sportsman's Diary entitled "A Plea for the African Elephant," displays at first a trenchant self-critique: The wealthy man anathematized the trader for shooting elephants for the sake of their ivory, yet the rich man does as bad, although he cannot plead that his subsistence depends upon his doing so. The professional elephant hunter is, as a rule, a rough and indifferently educated man, who adopts this very hardest of all businesses to obtain money to support him when age, exposure, and hardship has told upon his constitution, while the favoured son of fortune goes in for killing this game that he may boast of his prowess at his club, or exhibit his trophies to admiring relatives and guests. I leave it for the unprejudiced reader to judge which of these two types of men deserve the greatest amount of condemnation. (62) However, Gillmore' s appeal for this "grand mammoth of brute creation," this "noble, sagacious creature," takes the form of another twist to the</page><page sequence="16">94 DAN WYLIE imperial screw: the elephants must be protected, but must "repay" their protectors, who, "by domesticating [the elephants] and employing them in agriculture, in transport, in pageants, in destroying the carnivorous brutes, and, finally, as the instruments by which to explore every hole and corner in the unknown parts of the 'dark continent'" (63), can continue their colonial role with the collusion of the very wildlife they are conquering. (The parallel to the treatment of indigenous peoples hardly needs underlining.) No one deals with the moral dialogue more truculently than Arthur Neumann: Of course, I am prepared to be denounced as cruel. I admit at once that I am. This trait is part and parcel of the barbaric tastes which caused me, in my earliest years, to be stigmatised as a "cruel boy," by tender-hearted members of my family, for my ardour in the pursuit of the harmless, necessary cat, in company with a couple of equally keen terriers .... One cannot complain of the censure of kind-hearted people who object altogether to the taking of life - on the contrary, I respect them. But the attacks of such superior sportsmen as, while giving us graphic accounts of their exploits in pursuit of the harmless eland, giraffe and other defenceless creatures, write in horror of the cruelty of hunting elephants (having themselves not penetrated far enough into the wilderness to get the chance), are harder to bear. It is particularly cruel, they tell us, to hunt cow elephants .... I wish one of those gentlemen would come and show us how to shoot bulls only, in the dense cover in which elephants have to be sought . . . (viii) It's a curious argument in many ways. In Nietzschean mode, Neumann surlily accepts his fundamentally "barbaric" nature, implying that the elephants are as "necessary" to its expression as the cat of his youth; but on a number of occasions in the body of his account he evinces a greater admiration, almost compassion, for brute creation than many of his contemporaries. The admission of barbarism is one most hunting "sportsmen" would vehemently deny. Neumann here uses the term "sportsman" disparagingly, where contemporaries like Samuel Baker would use it to distinguish the superior hunter from the "merciless gunner" whose "love is slaughter, indiscriminate and boundless" (Baker vii). Baker also explicitly equates the latter with the (he claims) indiscriminate killings conducted by "the African savage" who never exhibits "any sympathy or pity, his desire being, like the gunner of the nineteenth century, to exterminate" (58). The sportsman is by definition civilised, not barbaric.</page><page sequence="17">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 95 Neumann claims for himself, however, many of the qualities of just such a sportsman: a man who, in Baker's words, "studies nature with keen enjoyment, and shoots his game with judgement and forebearance upon the principles of fair play" (vii). Such protestations are always somewhat disingenuous: Neumann on his own account blazes away at half-concealed elephants of unknown value and loses a commensurate number of wounded animals in the bush. As no hunter will ever confess, there's little "fair play" (except in those rare cases where the elephant is armed with a rifle of similar calibre), but the ethical argument in the text reveals a guilty realisation. To offset it Neumann, like his fellow-hunters, stresses the dangers of elephant-hunting, the depth of "penetration" into "dense cover" necessary for success. This is justified to the extent that he once got stamped on by an irate elephant; but at that point he is grimly laconic about his injuries, even chivalrous: There is no need to describe my sufferings. That they were intense is self-evident .... In following this pursuit one must reckon with the risks; and I always knew that there was a probability of an accident happening some day .... Just retribution, perhaps you will say; and, for my part, I harboured no ill-will against the elephant for avenging its kith and kin. It was the fortune of war. (325-26) What's interesting is that momentary lapse into an anthropomorphic mode - elephant as conscious avenger, as member of a family structure - immediately dismissed by an appeal to a 'higher' ethical level, "the fortune of war." It was an "accident" - a formulation ignoring the fact that the elephant only charged because Neumann was himself shooting at it. The man evokes from the beast the behaviour which justifies his own bestiality. At the same time, contradictorily, the activity is justified by invoking personal choice, the choice of vulnerability to danger, to a realm of imagined possibilities. All such justification, it's implied, is therefore positional, contingent; indeed, it's the element of personal choice which makes it exciting. Killing is the ultimate exercise of choice. Nowhere is the moral ambivalence of the elephant hunter's project more comprehensively encapsulated. And the lapses and contradictions are tellingly reflective of those I outlined in Karl Kroeber's book.</page><page sequence="18">96 DAN WYLIE V The views expressed by these hunters are, in almost every respect, those of a minority; their attractiveness depended on their remaining a minority. Ironically, their destruction of the wildlife was their way of assuring that status. At the same time, their ways of seeing animals and wilderness had incalculable effects on a wide readership, perhaps particularly amongst people of administrative importance in the European Imperium. Widespread attempted emulation of Selous is only the most prominent example. While these hunters' rhetorics were beginning to stabilise into a recognisable genre, they were also perpetually disturbed by the crosscurrents of other, evolving opinions. In some ways these rhetorics mark their situatedness; but literary genres also have a way of outliving their time, so that in some hunting accounts very similar narrative techniques and the laconic, macho tone are still used today, notably amongst game rangers. They also contrast with other kinds of hunting account, such as those of the popular novelists, or, at the furthest possible remove from these deeply masculine, commercial narratives, those of the American woman hunter Mary Zeiss Stange. But the fundamental point is this. The actual treatment of elephants displayed in these texts is deeply repugnant to current ecological and animal- rights thinking; but insofar as these texts reflect precisely the debates, and often even the rhetorics, of present-day ethical, economic and ecological debates over culling elephants - indeed, constitute the beginnings of the debate itself - they are too complex to be merely dismissed as 'bad.' A concentration on 'criticism' - on understanding the operations of language itself - alerts us to ways in which present-day ecological expression is similarly generic but shifting, imaginatively constructed in contradistinction to necessary opposites, and constitutive in its narrative strategies of particular identities. Even the 'scientific' precepts governing or inflecting a text are in the final analysis imaginative constructs, expressed in rhetorical modes, and are only made sense of within narratives, within particular arrangements of words. One may not wish to go as far as Mark Johnson in arguing that rationality is itself metaphoric in nature, and take the softer version favoured by, for instance, Niels Einarsson (1993) in his discussion of another "charismatic megavertebrate," the whale, and its symbolic capital. Either way, metaphoric substructures - symbolic imaginaries - are pervasive. The verbal machinery of that symbolic imagination is the proper focus of 'criticism.' The tools of that criticism are not in themselves 'ecological' or</page><page sequence="19">ELEPHANTS AND COMPASSION 97 'ethical'; they neither can nor need to be. At the same time, I don't want to say they can be entirely 'objective'; what tools we use are themselves historically placed. They can be compared, perhaps, to the tools that Sue Hendrickson used in extracting the bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex from the North Dakota badlands recently. The tools used now are very different from those of fifty years ago: high-speed drills to clean the bone, X-rays and computer projections to reveal the skull's inmost channels. The tools are not divisible from the passion to find and to reveal the bones just so, as they are; they are extensions of curiosity, of the project's sundry teleologies. They are also partly responsible for, or implicated in, the kinds of conclusions drawn from subsequent observations of the bones 'as they are.' The very clarity of exposure the tools allow us to attain may even be implicated in the emotional response of, say, vicarious fear at the massive ferocity of the beast. But the tools are not themselves the passion or the fear. To that extent, they retain a distinctive modus operandi. I am certainly not advocating, for instance, some ossified brand of New Criticism which denies that it is itself a theory and uses "the principle of exclusion to validate its coherence-conferring strategies" (Rabinowitz 20). Such exclusion is what an ethic, whether activist or subliminal, does, and I want only to suggest that in crucial respects 'criticism,' with its distinctive sets of tools, can usefully remain un- subsumed in those 'ecological' dimensions of this debate. Only 'criticism' in some form - even criticism which in our postmodern environment needs to engage in progressive "informed recentring" (Head 29) - engages fully with the symbolic resonances of what we choose to read, say, and do. The trajectory of emotional reactions towards the elephant - from slaughter to compassion (or perhaps slaughter with compassion) - over the last century crystallises so many aspects of the ecological dilemma that it's difficult to know where to begin and end. As elephants in southern Africa now increase by 14 000 per annum, necessitating regular culls, symbolic values keep shifting, the old rhetorics are redeployed in new formats, emotional capital is recharged with every change of fortune (witness the outcry recently when two stray elephants in Harare's suburbs were shot by Zimbabwe National Parks rangers). I have attempted here no more than to open up some questions about the roles of literature, and therefore of literary criticism, in the debate.
