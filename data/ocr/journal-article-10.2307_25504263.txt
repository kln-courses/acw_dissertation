<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENTIFIC METHOD By rev. p, j. Mclaughlin W7E all know the man with an infallible system for picking the winner "of a horse-race or a dog-race and beating the bookies. We smile at the claims he makes for his system, which he says is " sure to win " and is " never known to fail." Not so many of us smile at the claims made for scientific method. In fact, most of us are solemn when the august phrase is mentioned. We are solemn with good reason. The advance of science, pure and applied, has been prodigious, wonder succeeding wonder until we grow dizzy or even uneasy. Advances are attributed to the power of scientific method. So great has been the success of the scientific approach to many problems that there are not wanting those who would apply it to all problems, whether political, social, philosophic, economic or ethical. To not a few people scientific procedure smacks of the magical; it is almost the twentieth century version of the universal panacea, the elixir vit , or the philosopher's stone. Before he died in 1936, Pavlov asserted that all problems could be solved by scientific method. " Scientific method," he said, " is omni-competent." Yet, when we ask what precisely is this marvel, we are met with vague or discordant replies. Not all agree in their definition. The cause of disagreement is clear enough; scientific method is not one but many. Like all overworked words, it can mean much or little. There are as many scientific methods as there are separate sciences. In other words, the phrase is often employed to denote the technique, i.e., specific procedures or processes, of a particular department of knowledge. In any particular subject, you learn or assimilate scientific method by becoming an apprentice, you condition your mind, eye and hand by " going through the mill " in the company of a master, having intimate contact with the details of the subject, checking your own experiences in the light that has been slowly developed by countless generations of your predecessors; finally, by interpreting fresh experiences in discussions with your fellows so as to arrive at better statements of problems and find new and better ways of doing old and new things. Thus, advance may be made by the discovery or invention of shortening processes (as in the case of Napier and his logarithms), by replacing evolution with involution. Economy (or efficiency), which involves the ratio of result or achievement to effort and expenditure, is one of the notes of scientific method. It is more often found with men of science and business-men than with civil servants; it is more often found 38</page><page sequence="2">SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS 39 with men not tied to security, but happy when new things are attempted and adventure relieves the monotony of routine. An individual, if he could live long enough, if he had an infinity of time at his disposal, could solve any problem, in any subject, which is rationally solvable; any normal person has this power within him. Individuals have not infinite time at their disposal, though in a sense the human race has. The economy of scientific method refers not only to an efficient use of time?the power to telescope time?but also to economy of thought, economy of effort, and economy of means. Yet scientific method is painstaking and is not afraid of hard work where it is necessary. Scientific method is not infrequently called the experimental method, yet those who employ this term would not deny that astronomers and geologists, whose subjects are observational or inexact rather than experi mental or precise, are scientists in the modern sense. Some, too, would admit that mathematicians make use of scientific method; though, frankly, mathematics has a minimal of observation or experience behind it, and a maximum of deductive reasoning. Its concepts are on a different plane of abstraction from those of the experimental sciences, and its proofs have a different kind of cogency. Again, scientific method is at times identified with the inductive method, about which so much heat and so little light have been generated by Bacon, J. S. Mill, J. M. Keynes and other writers. As every honest error, by the nature of the human mind, has a grain of truth in it, all these inadequate and highly imperfect descriptions of scientific method have something in them. So, too, when scientific method is looked on as the most up-to-date way of tackling a problem, there is a positive element in the view, indicating the progressive character of scientific procedure, and emphasising that men of science stand on each others' shoulders, and that scientific knowledge is by accretion, and is dependent on social cohesion and co-operation. Science and its methods have world values; they transcend personal (i.e. subjective) and national frontiers; and they are the same in China as in Peru. Occasional historic exceptions, as in the Newton-Leibnitz controversies about the infinitesimal calculus, by retarding develop ment, only prove the rule. Though the history of science has many instances of punditry?as in the case of Ohm (who was victimised for stating his famous law)?and oracular utterances?as in statements of theories of phlogiston and evolution?scientific method is not dependent on authoritarianism or die-hard tradition. It. is not tied to a great name, whether the name be British, American?or even Russian. (At least this was the way until recently.) We cannot say off-hand that scientific method is necessarily the method employed by a great scientist; say, Newton in his remarkable work for the British Mint; in the many years he spent (shock ingly) on alchemy; in his incursions into Biblical exegesis; as well as</page><page sequence="3">40 UNIVERSITY REVIEW in his optical researches, mathematical discoveries and cosmological inventions. Scientific method can free itself from binding traditions and obsolete equipment: it has direct and intimate contact with its subject matter, and is opposed to the bureaucratic system which is remote and often disdainful of the material it feeds on. What, then, is the gist of scientific method ? What are its essential features ? Viewing the ever varying and ever multiplying patterns of the sciences, and including all three groups corresponding to Aristotle's three grades of abstraction, we see that scientific method is first of all rational. What distinguishes man is his power of reasoning. As the old definition puts it, he is no " featherless biped " but a " rational animal " (potentially, if not always actually so). Common sense is mostly rational method. Scientific method is an elaboration of common sense. It goes, of course, much deeper than common sense, so-called, and is more complex and is more highly organised and specialised. But the essence of both is rationality, man's rationality, which may be either discursive or intuitional. Both presuppose a climate of opinion, a background of ideas and beliefs substantially accepted by all or nearly all, but at different levels and usually with a time-lag. Common sense is usually built on the science of yesterday, and science helps to generate the common sense of to-morrow. But each man at his own level is in the main conditioned and limited by the concepts and theories he shares with his fellows. He must pose his problems in familiar terms, and this may render the problem impossible of solution. If nature is not interrogated in suitable terms, it may be hard to make sense of her reply. She acts like the electronic computer which returns a nonsensical solution to an improperly stated problem. " Perceptive attitudes are required for meaningful answers." Infrequently, revolutions occur in the history of ideas, when men like Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Descartes, Newton or Einstein alter some of the basic or common, everyday, categories, and set up new frame-works for men to think in. But rational method works on the new ideas after the same fashion as it worked on the old. Man's nature and faculties do not change. Logic is always logic, the same for Schroedinger as for St. Thomas. We may talk about multi-valued logic, mathematical logic and other techniques, but no one seriously believes that the nature of ratiocination has changed from Aristotle to Boole. In the broad view, scientific method is fundamentally rational method at work in a science, whatever the nature of the science, whether it be on the natural, mathematical or philosophic planes of abstraction. Every science is a blend of reason and experience. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as pure mathematics, for even the most abstract branch of mathematics presupposes some sense knowledge for its definitions and axioms. A mathematician without senses could never make sense. No more a philosopher. Least of all the natural philosopher, The amounts</page><page sequence="4">SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS 4? of reasoning and experience vary from one science to another. Technology is more experience than reason, and mathematics is the other way round, more reason than experience. In philosophy, the emphasis is on reflection, which is the exercise of reason at its highest level. Reflection is critical, questioning, and always seeks the ultimate reason of things. " The philo sopher does not seek an explanation of things, he seeks the things which explain themselves," it has been well said. Natural science is content with immediate reasons, with the " how " rather than the " why " of things. The reflective method of the philosophical sciences often utilises the same four steps as the species of rational method characteristic of the natural sciences. These steps are observation, hypothesis, implication and verification. Observation (which springs from curiosity) is selective, and isolates from the infinitely rich world?the manifold or plurality, as the philosophers call it?those brute facts which are the proper subject-matter of the science. The born scientist has a flair for the significant facts and ignores what is irrelevant to his department : he concentrates his attention on essential aspects of nature, that is, essential for his particular study, whether he be chemist, biologist, sociologist, theologian or other. Some times his selection (like his tests) is made by trial and error. Hypothesis or theory calls for imagination to classify, to inter-relate, and interpret or explain the observed, selected facts. It attempts to give organic unity to the brute facts, and may produce a highly organised and complex system, as in the vast syntheses of modern physics and chemistry and other branches of knowledge. Hypothesis is a supposition to explain something, and it is generally based on principles independent of the facts to be explained. Hypothesis is followed by implication or inference, which is a purely logical process, an exercise of pure reason. It is sometimes called prediction, and in this form is a well known and sometimes spectacular mark of scientific method. The fourth step is verification, either by experiment or by further and closer observation. And so the steps are recapitulated, like the digits of a recurring decimal, until one arrives?if one can ever be said to arrive? by successive approximations, or asymptotically, at the goal, which is truth. It is misleading to call the method induction, since the third step is strictly deductive. The four steps can be applied to any order of experience, religious as well as physical, philosophical as well as mathematical; but the styles of observation and verification will naturally differ with the type of experience. The scientist with imagination devises really crucial experiments to test his hypothesis or theory. The climax of the procedure is verification. This consists in trying out the hypothesis to see if the effects, which ought to appear if the hypothesis is true, actually do appear. Therein lies the heart of the exp?rimental method, which was much studied by Mill. But the principle of verification is based on a fallacy in logic, which goes by the name of " the affirmation of the consequent." The logical form is :</page><page sequence="5">42 UNIVERSITY REVIEW A implies B B is true Therefore, A is true. Let us compare this with the argument: If the professor was in the accident, he must be injured. The professor has a cut on his right hand. Therefore, he was in the car smash. We see the fallacy arises from failure to recognise that various causes might have produced the observed effect : the effect need not have been due to a unique cause. The professor could have cut his hand with a knife. Why, then, is the method so successful ? Paradoxically, we overcome the fallacy by committing it often enough. The logical form can be written: A implies B, C, D, E, F, G . . . . B is true, C is true, D is true .... When we find the implications all true, verification is now such that only an improbable set of coincidences constitutes the alternative to our induction that A is true. The safe conclusion is that A is true?pending further information. Thus, conclusions in science are never absolute or final : they may be further coloured, or tinted by fresh lights. Again, the conclusions are approximations; yet as time goes on, they are increasingly accurate approxi mations to the truth. So, too, as we shall see later, scientific method is not fixed, rigid or static, but it can be continually modified and perfected. Herein lies much of its strength. Scientific method is always learning, that is, it is always alert to assimilate new discoveries and fresh information. True scientific method is humble, never arrogant. in the view of the historian, Herbert Butterfield (in The Origins of Modern Science), modern science with its developing method, is seen as a symphony in three movements. The symphony opens with the Greeks, with their discovery of rational method, how the human mind can deduce fresh knowledge from facts already known (the deductive method). The second movement occurred in the Middle Ages, when the conviction was formed that the universe is rational and is subject to regular law, and is not arbitrary or capricious, the product of sheer accident or chance. The last movement began three centuries ago, when, for the first time, it was recognised that the final appeal in science must be to observation or experi ment, not to authority or tradition. The scientific spirit is first found in the Greeks. They had a disinterested curiosity. They did not seek knowledge to increase their earning power or social standing. They wished to know just for the fun of knowing, unlike the " practical man ". With the rise of the Greeks, human consciousness took a real step forward. They were the first people with a grasp of</page><page sequence="6">SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS 43 mathematical and philosophical reasoning, with insight into the nature or essence of things. Prominent among them was Pythangoras who had an intense feeling about the importance of number ("discontinuous or discrete quantity ") in the structure of the universe. But Pythagoras, like Descartes nearer to us, overestimated the scope and power of mathematics, the science of quantity, and he is not without disciples in our own generation. The medievalist lived in a purposeful, orderly, universe; and he was familiar with its scheme and working. His outlook discouraged scientific enquiry, but it engendered an essential and basic element in modern science; for it established the position that nature is a rational whole and not an affair of chance or chaos. Without this principle, the incredibly painstaking and heroic labours of men of science would be in vain. Not until the 17th century do we find resort being had to experiment, or refined observation, as a test of the correctness of a viewpoint. At this point, the essential stages in the growth of scientific method had taken place, though no one realised it at the time. For instance, Galileo Galilei did not see clearly, or appreciate fully, the necessity of confirming mathematical deductions by experiments; and many of his successors thought that natural happenings could be inferred and predicted purely from metaphysical or abstract principles. Quite recently, Sir Arthur Eddington appears to have held a like view in his Fundamental Theory, which has been broadly summed up by Sir Edmund Whittaker in the statement: the external world is ismorphous with the square of quaternion algebra. In other words, from a knowledge of the principles of Hamilton's quaternions, one can infer the values of the constants of nature (such as the ration of the mass of the proton to the mass of the electron) without any need for fresh experiment or measurement. In the history of scientific method, Descartes played the role which British writers like to attribute to Francis Bacon. Bacon was no mathe matician; he lacked the mind and eye of a geometer and was quite inadequate to his age. Descartes, on the other hand, was an accomplished disciple of Pythagoras : he worshipped at the shrine of quantity?whether continuous or discrete?and he believed that every regularity of nature could be reduced to mathematical terms. Enamoured of the type of certitude which is afforded by mathematics, he desired to bring the same kind of certainty to all branches of knowledge. The shadow of Descartes lies heavy on modern scientific method. Since his time, there is the tendency to concentrate on the " quantity " aspects of reality at the expense of other properties, and there is a constant endeavour to force all the sciences into the Procrustean bed of mathematical science, belittling what cannot be timed, weighed or metred. Descartes it was, too, who first stated succinctly and clearly the analytic method so characteristic of modern science that Newman summed it up simply in the words " science analyses," while critics and poets peevishly</page><page sequence="7">44 UNIVERSITY REVIEW complain it " murders and dissects ". The principle of dividing a problem (and a subject) into as many units as possible and dealing with each separately is given by Descartes in his Discours de la M?thode (it is the second of his famous four rules of the scientific method); and it is applied in the principle of division of labour, so much a feature of modern mass production methods. Since Descartes, penetrating studies of method in the sciences have been made by Stallo, Duhem, and Poincar?. The studies are profound if not always illuminating. The work of men who are masters of the subject, they are outstanding as criticisms and appreciation of modern scientific method, of what it really is. We get to closer grips with scientific method when we follow most moderns and restrict it to the exercise of rational method in the natural sciences. The sciences of nature display a bustling activity in our day. By comparison with the philosophical sciences they are like living things, they grow and develop. They give rise to new, burning, and topical questions, capable of solution, while the problems of philosophy remain perennial. Scientific method in this narrower, modern, technical sense achieves a satisfying type of certitude which leads to agreement about the answers it gives to questions. For instance, one person may say " the day is hot," another may say " it is cold," but the man of science takes a thermometer, reads it and says " it is 36? Fahrenheit "; and there is no further dispute or argument. This is because scientific method depersonalises measures and makes them objective and independent of our feelings. It eliminates the subjective. In order to do so, it is ever on the look-out for new ways of conceiving problems so as to introduce " quantity " ideas or deputy (surrogate) quantifiable concepts. Notions and definitions are operational and refer to physical rather than to logical classes. The man of science has no definition of the properties he studies but in the description or recipe he gives of how to measure them. Unlike the muddle-headed Victorian who was a metaphysician without knowing it, the modern physicist does not define ' force ' as ' the cause of motion '; but says * force is measured by measuring the product of a mass by its acceleration.' It is not his business to say what ' force ' is. That is for the philosopher to say. He abandons the anthropomorphic idea of force as akin to muscular force, and accepts only the operational definition. Again, in the search for * quantized ' con ceptions he tends to replace logical classes by physical classes. The former are clear-cut and depend on the principle of contradiction. An object is in class A or it is not There is no third possibility. Physical classes, depending on measureable or quantitative properties, have not this definite ness. An object may have more or less of the property. So physical classes are represented by the so-called * normal ' distribution curve (bell-shaped or hill-shaped) of probability and statistics. The answer to a question about a thing being in a physical class is not a clear-cut 'yes' or 'no\ but is 'more or</page><page sequence="8">SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS 45 less' or may be 'maybe'. But not all the ideas required by men of science are reducible to physical classes and operational definitions. This is the error of logical positivists and some exponents of semantics, the science of meaning, who tend to ignore that even science must have its imponderables, its abstract ideas, its ideals and spirit. The importance of operational ideas and operational definitions for scientific method helps to explain why the phrase * operational research ' was so much in use in the last world war. Modern science insists that man is the ' measurer ' rather than the * measure ' of things. The philosopher adopts the opposite view, saying, if man ceases to be the measure of things, he abdicates his reason, ceases to be a rational animal, becomes emotional, instinctive (wonderfully so), yet reduces to a mere marvellous mass of conditioned reflexes, like Pavlov's dog. Through concentrating on operational ideas and developing them the scientist has been able to extend the frontiers of his territory. By inventing new concepts and new ways of looking at things, he has been able to apply measuring techniques (based on clock, rule and scales) to fresh areas of knowledge, hitherto not amenable to quantitative study. Thus, after successes in astronomy, physics and chemistry and the like, the measuring processes have been applied with some success to domains formerly regarded as the preserve of the philosopher, such as psychology and sociology. These extensions have back-fired and have changed the conception of scientific method itself. In a recent view, R. L. Schanck in The Permanent Revolution in Science (New York Philosophical Library, 1954) regards scientific method as the combination of two elements, design and experiment, mutually tested. The former is philsophic by nature, the latter experiential. This view emphasises the advantage of studying a problem in an abstract way, by logic, before putting a question to nature. In scientific method, Schanck sees philosophers and scientists coming together to pool their powers. Formerly, philosophy was the queen of the sciences. When the special sciences had done their work, the philosopher took over and assigned values ; he generalized and integrated the findings of the men of science. We recall Plato's dictum that only the philosopher, who had mastered all departments of knowledge should be king (in modern language, a prime minister or senior civil servant). As science successfully invaded field after field of the philosopher of old?recall how the natural philosopher is now known as a scientist?and as exploiters of knowledge frequently take the place of the disinterested speculative enquirer, there emerges what is called methodology (it is not a pretty word, but it is in use). Due to the development of borderline fields like physical chemistry, biochemistry, physiological psychology, social psychology, modern geography and so forth, the relations between the sciences have become a matter of scientific enquiry rather than a matter</page><page sequence="9">46 UNIVERSITY REVIEW of mere speculation or a priori-ism. Methodology is the name given to the scientific study of scientific method, especially the mode of conceiving a problem. Many books have appeared on the mode of thinking peculiar to the sciences?and there are several periodicals dealing with the philosophy of science, as the study of scientific method and principles of science is called. An Institute of Methodology has been set up, perhaps not unexpectedly, in the United States. Here (with the organising talent characteristic of the Americans, as of the Romans of old, who get the most by team-work, using men's strength combined, rope-fashion, and not at their weakest, chain-style) philosophers and scientists work together, but it is understood that the philosophers should be specialists in at least ox\q department of science in order to undertake problems of methodology. The philosopher's function is to co-ordinate research by applying general criteria for the adequacy of experimental investigation ; criticise technique ; define experimental control ; define how a question has meaning ; estimate how much of a problem should be worked out in the mind, or conceptualised, and how much of it should be experimentally investigated. The Institute has already tackled and solved unusual problems, as for instance, how to devise ways of measuring public opinion, consumer-interest, audience-reactions ; how to apply statistical methods to marketing and sampling, as in costing or " regression analysis " (cutting costs in a factory by finding how production factors affect output), and inspection of mass-produced articles so as to guarantee their quality to the consumer. The Institute regards as reactionary the " great books " tradition which seeks to return to a mere survey and imitation of classical illustrations of scientific method. Its members believe they are already, with the aid of philosophy, turning the study of scientific method into a science. The success of scientific method has been attributed to the following principle, which Professor Dingle calls the basic principle of modern science. "A single experience, however trivial, has the power of over-riding all inference from the whole of the rest of experience, if it should be inconsistent therewith." The statement has a great number of suppositions underlying it, and it is too often forgotten that these * taken-for-granteds ' were estab lished by the medievalists and the Greeks. One should add to the principle, in order the better to understand the success of modern science and its methods, a word on its self-correcting power, a remarkable power which derives from the spirit of truth-seeking. The self-correcting faculty shows itself in this way: in the long run, what is really known is taken up or subsumed in the development of science, and the rest is dropped because it has not stood up to criticism. As long as there is free discussion, something is formed which transcends its bearers, and no man fully understands ; no one conceives or guesses the pattern of the endless quest, but we constantly move towards it, hopefully.</page></plain_text>
