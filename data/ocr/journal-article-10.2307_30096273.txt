<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. (PLATE VI.) SI.-TIE SECOND CAMPAIGN-OUTLYING SITES. We resumed work on March 23, I903. The headquarters of the expedition were again at Angathia. Mr. M. N. Tod, Assistant-Director of the School and Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, had preceded me, going overland. Mr. W. L. H. Duckworth, Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and University Lecturer in Anthropology, and Mr. R. McG. Dawkins, Scholar of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, arrived a few days later. Mr. C. T. Currelly, of Victoria College, Toronto, who had been digging for the Egypt Exploration Fund under Professor Petrie, joined us for the last six weeks of the season. The Roussolakkos trenches being full of water, I decided to start work at Kouraminos on a bay I1 miles further north, where in 1902 I had seen the foundations of a wall running inland from the sea, enclosing the best part of the plain at the head of the bay and rejoining the sea half a mile beyond. It seemed possible that this was the wall mentioned in the Toplu inscription (Dittenberger, Sylloge2, ii. 929) as enclosing the precinct of Dictaean Zeus, the more so as large blocks were visible on rising ground near the sea. It proved however to have been a rTiervo only in the Homeric sense of an enclosed estate. The excavation gave us the ground-plan of a Mycenaean farmstead, described in detail below (p. 329) by Mr. Tod and Mr. Dawkins. Meanwhile Mr. Duckworth undertook the further exploration of the ossuaries which had been discovered and partially excavated in the previous season. His full report on these prehistoric human remains and on the anthropographic data which he collected at Athens and in Crete, will</page><page sequence="2">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 275 appear in the Journal of t/e Anthropological Institute. A summary of his conclusions was submitted to the Anthropological Section of the British Association last September. In brief, he measured sixty-four male and twenty-three female crania from these ossuaries, in which they were associ- ated occasionally with miniature stone vases, obsidian flakes, small bronze single axes, and triton-shells, and regularly with pottery ranging from polychrome Kamires to a coarser transitional ware (see p. 300 ff. below), but never with true Mycenaean vases. 'In this early Cretan population longheadedness is quite predominant: of forty-six male crania available for examination thirty (65'3 per cent) are dolicho- cephalic, twelve (26I5 per cent.) are of mean proportions, and only four (or 8'55 per cent.) are short. The corresponding percentage figures for female skulls are 70'6 dolicho-cephalic, 23'53 of mean proportions, and 5'87 of short skulls .... The long bones afford an estimate of the stature .. . i624'9 mm. for men (below 5 feet 5 inches). This is a distinctly low stature, and the bones are slight.' Thus in head-form and stature, Mr. Duckworth concludes, these early Cretans conformed to the type of the Mediterranean race. The modern type in Eastern Crete is quite different from the prehistoric; the prevailing head-form is now brachycephalic and the stature of the men markedly greater. Some trial-excavations in the inland glen of St. Nicholas, under- taken by Mr. Tod in continuation of his quest for the Dictaean Temple, enabled Mr. Duckworth to examine skulls of a still earlier period. This region was recommended by the presence of a fragmentary decree immured in the chapel, as well as by its impressive position un.der the mountain-cone of Modhi. Once more Min6an, not Hellenic, remains presented themselves, first another farmhouse, then a deposit of bones accompanied by pottery presenting analogies to early Trojan and Cycladic types, in a grotto under the cliff. See Mr. Tod's report, p. 336, and Mr. Duckworth's, p. 344 below. So soon as the trenches had been drained, we resumed work on the town-site at Roussolakkos. The course of this, the main excavation, to which we devoted the next two months, will be described in a separate section. Another subsidiary task was undertaken in April by Mr. J. L. Myres, Secretary of the Cretan Exploration Fund, who arrived with Professor Ernest Gardner's cruising-party, and was induced to exchange the luxuries of ocean travel for the privations of the excavator's lot. I had to go back to Athens for a time, and Professor Gardner was so good as to give me a passage to Smyrna. Mr. Myres explored a building on the top T2</page><page sequence="3">276 R. C. BOSANQUET of Petsofi, the peak overlooking Roussolakkos, with brilliant results. It proved to be a primitive sanctuary, rich in votive terracottas, figures of men and women, legs, arms, and other parts of the human body, and an enormous number of animals, some thousands in all. As he was unable to exhaust the site before his return to Oxford, it was taken in hand by Mr. Currelly, who doubled the 'bag' but obtained few fresh types. See Mr. Myres' report, p. 356 below. I returned on May II with the fIselreise party of the German Institute, Dr. Dorpfeld having very kindly brought Dr. Evans and myself as his guests from Candia by way of Gournit to Palaikastro. The excavation of the town had made great progress under the direction of Mr. Tod and Mr. Dawkins, and Mr. Currelly had prepared a set of drawings of the most important vases while superintending the pro- cesses of cleaning and mending in the cottage which serves as workshop. During Dr. Evans's visit I rode with him to Lower and Upper Zakro. At the former place we heard of the finding of a lump of metal, which I was afterwards able to secure for the Candia Museum: it proved to be part of a copper ingot like those of which a store was found at Hagia Triadha. Near Upper Zakro we examined the early site called 'AOporroXrove (cf. B.S.A. vii. 147), where some terracottas seen by Mr. Evans in 1896 were said to have been found in a small cave. We succeeded in identifying the spot, one of a series of hollows under a low brow of cliff facing east, and from the little earth that remained undug we extracted a large rudely modelled ox, a larger horn, and parts of the legs of two human figures, all in a red clay like the material of the coarser figures from PetsofA. This is in harmony with other small pieces of evidence-such as a steatite blossom-bowl found above the village of Magash, and two Kamires vases found at Kochlakibs-which tend to show that the Min6an civilisation was at home in the interior of Eastern as of Central Crete, and was not represented only by trading- factories on the coast, as at one time seemed possible. One other outlying site was explored in a cursory way. Mr. Currelly and I sailed one Saturday evening round the south-eastern point of Crete to Kouphonisi, the ancient Leuke, and devoted the morrow to a surface- study of the island. We were on the look-out for purple-shell, since a fourth-century inscription mentions a tithe of purple in connection with Leuke. The result was one more instance of the extraordinary predomin- ance of Min6an over Hellenic remains in Crete, for we found not only a</page><page sequence="4">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 277 bank of crushed murex-shell, but beside it a whole nest of Kamires pottery. As harvest drew near it became increasingly difficult to keep our best men. We had arranged for some supplementary digging at Praesos, but owing to an attack of fever, which forced Mr. Tod to return to Athens on May 28, this was postponed. A week later our preparations for departure were all made, when the French gun-boat Condor steamed into Grandes Bay, and Captain Escande with most opportune kindness offered to take two of us along the south coast, an offer which Mr. Currelly and I were glad to accept; we take this opportunity of thanking him for his hospit- ality, which we enjoyed for two memorable days. We parted from Captain Escande and the Condor at Phaistos, where we were entertained by Dr. Pernier, and thence rode to Candia. Mr. Dawkins remained till June II in order to finish the plan, and then paid the visit to Karpathos which he has described in this volume (p. I76). 1 2.-THE TOWN. (PLATE VI.) The prehistoric town at Roussolakkos was laid out in regular blocks, each containing several houses. We went on the system of following up the streets and ascertaining the extent of an insula before excavating it. The blocks are named f, ry, S and so on, and to each room as it is opened up a number is given, the Greek alphabet being used in order to avoid confusion with the letters and numbers by which the squares on the plan are denominated. The excavated area was surveyed by Mr. R. M. Dawkins, who has prepared an excellent plan on which the walls of different periods are so far as possible distinguished; but another season must elapse before the problems of stratification can be handled with absolute confidence. The simplified copy reproduced in this provisional report has been redrawn from Mr. Dawkins' plan by Herr Seyk, draughtsman to the German Archaeological Institute at Athens. The majority of the drawings of vases in this report are also Mr. Dawkins' work, the remainder being by Mr. Currelly and Mr. Halvor Bagge. It should be noted that in the following articles we have adopted a</page><page sequence="5">278 R. C. BOSANQUET conventional orientation following that of the plan; north, south, east, and west are used as though the top of the plan were due north. Our starting-point was the street west of Block f, discovered last year. This was traced in both directions for a total distance of 145 m., and three successive insulae abutting on it from the south were more or less completely excavated. Three streets at right angles to it were opened up, one for over 70 m. and the others for shorter distances. The streets, though narrow according to modern ideas-they vary from I'40 to 2'50 m. -are wider than those at Phylakopi. One cross-street by exception has a width of nearly 4 m., between / and an unexcavated block, /. More than half the breadth of the main street is taken up by a raised and paved footpath; the part of it adjoining 8 has a very massive pavement bordered by a deep gutter, the bottom of which is the upper surface of an older pavement "85 m. below. Between e and o we reached a very ancient road- surface buried in deep rubbish among which were Kamires vases; it was paved with rounded cobbles, closely set, much like those in modern Cretan villages. A detailed description of the several blocks is given in the ensuing sections, but it may be convenient to give a less technical summary of their more important features here. Further examination of the house in 3 excavated last year exposed the column-bases, two square and four round, of a verandah in the court, with remains of its burned woodwork. The house in y on the other side of the main street proved to have a front of carefully squared freestone masonry with frequent setbacks, which correspond with the internal partitions. The hitherto unaccountable setbacks conventional in Mycen- aean architecture may have originated in this practice of indicating the junction of a partition wall with the main wall. The stairs opposite the front door are of secondary construction ; under them we found a large well-built bath-room, reached by steps like the sunken bath-room in the Palaces. A house further west contains what looks like a shop, consisting of a room with one side open to the street, and behind it a narrow store- room fitted with a stone sink. The north-western part of the block has been robbed of its stones and there is little hope of recovering the Mycenaean ground-plan, but from the lower levels, more accessible here than elsewhere, came a quantity of early pottery, including a splendid Kamires 'fruit-stand.'</page><page sequence="6">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 279 Block 3 lies west of y, and has a frontage of 40 m. on the main street. Its southern portion, a labyrinth of small rooms shewing signs of frequent reconstruction, did not prepare us for the massive masonry and spacious planning of the Mansion which occupies the northern part of the block. There are two well-marked floor levels corresponding to the two levels in the adjoining part of the main street. A hall of the original house exhibits a group of four column-bases at the corners of a sunken square, precisely like the 'impluvium' of House B. The best marked features of the later Mansion are its entrance, 4 m. wide, which led to a stairway of the same width, and a small inner court or light-well, about 5 m. square, which must have been open to the sky, since its pavement slopes down to a broad and deep covered drain. FIG. I.-FEMALE HEAD CARVED IN BONE. On the same side of the main street we explored a third insula, E. The largest house had been much disturbed, and after making a plan we filled it in. West of it are two well preserved houses, each about 10 m. square. In one of them there are the remains of what seems to be an early wine-press, a raised cement floor I m. square, sloping towards a sunken jar. Block /3, of which the house excavated last year occupies a great part, was found to embrace several other houses. One of them contained a spouted jar and two pithoi below it, an arrangement already observed at Zakro and elsewhere, which probably played a part in the manufacture of oil. Another of these spouted jais or oil separators occurred in Block y; their characteristic feature is that the spout is placed flush with the bottom</page><page sequence="7">280 R. C. BOSANQUET of the vase. This year, as last, peas and barley were found in jars, and for the first time at Palaikastro, a few olive-kernels. Neither inscribed tablets nor seal impressions came to light; but the finding of seven engraved gems, two of them three-sided seals of great interest, attests the vigilance of our diggers. Of small objects the most valuable are a pair of electrum earrings covered with fine granulated work, the rim of a steatite cup bearing four incised characters of the Min6an script, and a well preserved carving of a woman's head in bone (Fig. I), the eyes and hair of which were supplied in some other material. FIG. 2.-SACRED HORNS (about 1: 4). Besides the ceremonial axes from Kouraminos, two, one large, one only five centimetres from tip to tip, were obtained from Roussolakkos, and a series of four Horn-emblems of various sizes carved in stone (Fig. 2). This year a little geometrical pottery occurred at the east end of the site, some bronzes related to those from the Altar-hill at Praesos, and a remarkable scarab. They shew that in classical times there was a temple here, as the previous discovery of architectural terracottas, which we traced to this field, had led us to suspect. The finding of a stratum of wood-ashes suggests that it was constructed principally of wood.</page><page sequence="8">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 281 1 3.-THE CHRONOLOGY OF PALAIKASTRO AND ZAKRO. We may divide the life of the town into three principal periods. I. The Kamtires Period. II. The Early Mycenaean Period, ending with the fall of Zakro. III. The Late Mycenaean Period. Of these the first is well defined, thanks to the labours of Dr. Mackenzie and of Mr. Dawkins, who has treated the sequence of the Kamires pottery at Palaikastro and the circumstances under which it has been found at some length in his paper on the Pottery. But the line between the second and third periods has not yet been drawn. The settlement at Palaikastro came into being earlier and survived later than its neighbour at Zakro, the life of which began, as I believe, midway in Period I. and ceased abruptly at the end of Period II. Both Mr. Hogarth and Mr. Dawkins have spoken of the pottery found in the houses there as late Mycenaean; the former describes it as 'almost exclusively characterised by the inferior glaze and debased ornament which we associate with the late efforts of Mycenaean art in the Aegean' (B.S.A. vii. 145), and Mr. Dawkins does not contest this judgment in his valuable study of the Zakro Pottery (f.H.S. xxiii. p. 254). I am disposed to place it much earlier and to regard the poorer painted vases as of local make and more or less contemporary with the splendid filler from House A, which is unquestionably a product of the Palace Period. The two houses which I excavated at Palaikastro in 1902 contained floor-deposits resembling those of the Zakro houses. Generalising from these two instances, I assumed that the town had been sacked at that time and never reoccupied. Last year, however, in y 9 and other houses, we came on floor-deposits containing pottery of quite different types, among them painted vases analogous to these of Ialysos, of Cyprus, and of the Period of Partial Occupation at Knossos. Palaikastro, then, was partially or wholly ruined at the end of the Second Period, about the time of the final desertion of Zakro, was partially reoccupied, and was finally ruined and abandoned at the end of the Third Period, which may perhaps be found to coincide with the final desertion of Knossos.</page><page sequence="9">282 R. C. BOSANQUET The pottery of the close of Period II. is best illustrated by the contents of the store-rooms 3 10 and 13. This house had been left in perfect order, and had evidently escaped being plundered. The principal rooms yielded hardly a fragment of pottery, hardly any small objects, while in the store-rooms there were hundreds of vases which had remained undisturbed except by the fall of the upper storey since the owners stowed l7I 20 23 21 241 22 25 FIG. 3.--FORMS OF VASES FROM $ 10 AND $ 13.

C. BOSANQUET This remarkable deposit has so many points in common with those of the Zakro houses, as to leave little doubt that the House 3 1-22 was deserted about the same time as the Zakro settlement. Only three painted vases were found among several hundreds of plain 'domestic' pots, but they seem to corroborate this dating. They are (a) two goblets of the same form and local fabric as one figured in 'Pottery from Zakro' (J.H.S. xxiii. p. 255, Fig. 23)-one bears the same ornament of double axes: (b) a cylindrical jar with rosette-shaped perforations figured B.S.A. viii. Plate XVII. 5; its decoration in white on a red slip has almost disappeared, but some idea of it is supplied by a similar jar found in 8 19 which is painted with a bull's head, a double axe, and flowers drawn in a style less naturalistic and therefore probably later than that of the two fine vases from the Zakro pits (J.H.S. xxii. Plate XII. 2 and 3). The lower-level house in 8, where this vase was found, was perhaps ruined at the same time as the house in .; they both exhibit the arrangement of four columns round a central light- well or impluvium which has not been found in the other houses. The group of eighteen painted 'fillers,' which so closely resemble one found in House A at Zakro, came from an adjoining room in 6 and seems to have been buried about the same time. Both 1 10 and 13 contained a lower stratum, which has still to be described. The vases rested on a trodden layer of brick-earth and broken pottery; nearly "20 m. deeper lies the floor proper, formed of hard white cement bordered by a red stripe "02 m. in width and distant "I3 from the wall. Unlike the whole vases above, many of the sherds shewed evident marks of exposure to fire. The most important object found in this stratum-or for that matter in the season's work-was a clay tablet "Io m. long, "7 m. wide, from oo09 to -oi3 m. thick, baked grey by the fire, and incised with seven lines of writing in a form of the linear script which at Knossos, Mr. Evans informs me, is found only in certain deposits dating from the early period of the great Palace (cf. his remarks, p. 52 above).1 natural perforations, broken vase-handles in clay and stone, a hoard made for some practical purpose, perhaps for use as loom-weights or net-sinkers. In 13, two whetstones. The shattered condition of the vases was accounted for by the broken slabs from floor and wall-facings of the room above which lay on and among them. Many of these slabs were coated on one side with fine white stucco; some had been fused by the heat of the fire into a sort of slag. 1 Minor finds here--B 10, bits of bone pin, triton-shell, flake of obsidian: 13, bits of bronze pin, obsidian, a grey flint, half of a hemispherical steatite bowl with one ledge-handle.</page><page sequence="12">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO.

BOSANQUET The potsherds stand to the whole vases above them in the same chronological relation as those of the Zakro Pits to the vases in the Zakro houses; indeed they have much in common with the pottery of the Pits. These were: (a) The only whole vase, a juglet of a type common to the ossuaries, where it is no doubt a late form, and to the Pits (Zakro Pottery, Fig. IX). (b) Numerous fragments of late Kamires cups with plain black surface tending to brown, and one with three white stripes on the outside- another link with the ossuaries. (c) Lower part of a Kamires bowl with impressed lines (cf. Zakro Pottery, 249, 3, four specimens from the Pits). Another instance of this technique occurred in /39 29, at the lower floor-level, along with the white neck of a filler like J.H.S., xxii. P1. XII. 3, and other types known from the Pits. (d) A four-handled jar, put together from fragments. It had an internal funnel, a peculiarity which links it with Zakro Pottery, Fig. 16. See Fig. 4. Our example has the orifice on top of one of its handles, otherwise it resembles the Zakro specimen. The eyes of the spiral and the horizontal bands were once picked out with white. The frieze of lunettes was common in the Pits. (e) Fragments of a conical filler of early style. (f) A jug with long bridged spout and cylindrical neck (Fig. 5), put together from fragments. For the form, developed by the addition of the neck from one common in Kamires ware, compare a magnificent spherical- bodied jug from Knossos (frieze of spirals with dot-rosettes in added white) and contemporary imitations found in Melos (Phylakopi, P1. XXV.). The design, a conventional representation of seaweed growing from rocks, was already known from the fine goblet found in the Vaphio tomb ('Ep. 'ApX. 1889, P1. VII. I9), from fragments found in the dromos of the same tomb, and from others at Phylakopi; there is a more sketchy version of it on the Palace-style vase from the Heraeum. Now a-dare types found in the Pits at Zakro, which, as Mr. Dawkins has shown, contain an accumulation of pottery extending over the period preceding the abandonment of the site ; while f perhaps the latest of the series, is linked by the Vaphio parallel with some of the best products of early Mycenaean art, and so furnishes a relative date for the earlier fire</page><page sequence="14">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 287 which left this lower deposit on the floor of /3 10 and /3 13, and probably occasioned the rebuilding of the house. 1 4.-THE HOUSES. BLOCK /3. This Insula is now seen to contain five houses, (i) 1-22, (ii) 23-25, (iii) 28-31, (iv) 26, 27 and 32-39, (v) 40-47. The partial excavation of I-36 was described in B.S.A. viii. pp. 3 Io-316. Rooms 1-22 -The continued investigation of this house yielded some interest- ing results. In the courtyard (11) we uncovered the remains of a verandah, the wooden pillars of which rested on round limestone bases (diam. "38 m., ht. "i8) distant 1'40 m. from the walls of rooms 10 and 12. On the East, rectangular bases alternated with the round ones, as in the courts of the palaces at Phaistos and Gourni,; these probably supported piers of brickwork or stone. A quantity of charred wood, brick-earth, and freestone blocks reddened and disintegrated by fire, lay over and round about the bases. At the West end of 13, where the plan shews a double wall, part of the later one "55 m. thick was removed, exposing a face of well-finished small ashlar coated with white plaster. The precisely similar masonry of a small house on the South of the Ridge was shown by the pottery found in it to be as old as the Middle Min6an period. 15 may be explained as a bath-room; its entrance was at the N.W., screened as usual by a cross-wall, not at the S.E. angle where the previous plan shewed it; its carefully plastered floor (Palaikastro I. p. 315) was level with the adjoining floors, as was that of the bath- room in the Queen's Megaron at Knossos. Further knife-work in 22, a square closet under the stairs which had yielded a quantity of rustic pottery in 1902, brought to light four large jars in a row against the back-wall, and two-one tele- scoped into the other as though originally placed on top of it---on the left. The floor is of pebble-concrete. Besides broken vases of types found in rooms 10 and 13, there were a clay 'fire-box,' a bronze sickle, a bundle of five needles (?) and three painted vases which seemed to have fallen from a shelf - a four-handled pyxis with a band of spots like the pseudamphora B.S.A. viii. p. 3I3, Fig. 26, the beaked jug figured on p. 285, and another like it. Two much finer vases had been packed away inside one of the pitoil. The uppermost, a flask decorated with polyps, coral and shells, was much crushed; the other, a magnificent oenochoe with a curious strainer- mouth, painted with two groups of three papyrus-like flowers, was broken only at the neck.' Both belong to an interesting class of early Mycenaean vases, the slip of which varies from warm yellow to a greenish grey, and the paint in like manner from warm brown to black; the greenish-grey and intense black tones are due to overfiring, and when they are found together the paint is always very friable The contents of this room were probably buried at the same time as those of 10 and 13. Rooms 23-25 originally formed an open court (24) from which opened a single room (25), perhaps a stable, the two rooms which encroach on the court 1 Like a flattened gourd with wheel-shaped body, elliptical mouth, and two small handles high on the shoulder. I know only three other examples of this rare form, found at Knossos, Psychro, and Phylakopi, all fragmentary. It is a forerunner of the spherical gourd (p. 316, Fig. 15 below), of which an early example was found in the Cave at Psychro.</page><page sequence="15">288 R. C. BOSANQUET being of later construction. The level of the court had been raised by filling it up with miscellaneous materials brought probably from some rubbish-heap; possibly it was liable to be flooded by the water which, as other indications show, flowed away down the adjacent street. Among the finds made here this year were a nodule of liparite, a small spouted steatite bowl, a small steatite lid, a bone awl, a quantity of small cups, fragments of wall-plaster (red-brown, yellow, dark blue, and white), and a large lentoid gem of late form and design : numerous fragments of 'rustic' pottery, but few of painted ware. Rooms 28-31 form a separate house, with a door probably at the S.E. angle. No fresh finds were made here. Rooms 26, 27, and 32-39 form another house, partially excavated in I902. What was then taken for the threshold proves to be a stone bench, the actual threshold being hard by, facing up the street towards y and 8. '[The level of the door-sill had been raised and a rough causeway, about "40 m. wide, '45 high, built from it along the street; and at the north end of the street, where it turns sharply to the W., a kerb had been built to guide surface-waters round the corner. These precautions, and the raising of the floor of / 24, noted above, indicate that after heavy rain the drainage of the southern part of the town escaped down this street. The paved vestibule with stone bench in a recess on the left repeats a familiar arrange- ment (cp. p 8, y , 1,8 47, and Zakro G); beyond the bench is a cupboard containing four plain jars. Next comes 32, the main living-room, which gave access to 26, 27, and probably also to 33, 35, 36, and 37, though the position of their doors is uncertain. The deposit of vases in 26 (B.S.A. viii. 316) belongs to a later period than any in / 1-22; on the other hand the group of large pithoi in 33, which stood at a lower floor-level, may have survived from the earlier period of destruction. since the decoration of the painted example (sprays, double-axes, and four-leaf whorls) is in a meticulous style precisely like that of the local painted ware in the Zakro houses and in /3 13. Some olive-stones were found on the floor of 32, and in 37 there is a group of jars which probably played a part in the manufacture of oil, consisting of an earthenware tub with a spout projecting over a pithos, the spout being flush with the bottom of the tub like that of the Hellenistic oil- separator at Praesos (B.S.A. viii. 268); similar groups were found at Zakro and at Cournii. In this case the 'separator' stands on a raised stone platform, and the recipient is not sunk in the ground. Among the earth in the latter was a steatite prism-seal (man, goat, ox-head). A quantity of carbonised matter was noted near the floor-level. The minor finds were a bronze axe-and-adze, a plain jug with flat base of the type found in o 4, a scrap of lead, and a dolium-shell. 35 yielded part of a clay lamp-stand like Fig. 24. 36 contains a stone trough, and a squared block in the middle of the floor, below the pavement, which probably served as base for a wooden pillar, as in 29. In 38 there were found an engraved amygdaloid gem, a bronze hook with twisted shank of a type already represented in the Candia Museum, and a hone; this room had two floor-levels, both originally paved but much disturbed. Immediately N. of 36 and 39, in square C 3 of the plan, there is a space which seems to have been vacant in the later Mycenaean age. A pit sunk here revealed a considerable accumulation of Mycenaean pottery and below that, after an interval, a very compact bed of Kamires sherds, of early types. Between the two there is an ancient floor-level and the footings of a wall are preserved. The sherds rest on virgin soil and stop short against a face of virgin soil to the N.</page><page sequence="16">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO.

Rooms 40-47 may prove to have been entered from the courtyard of the main house, / 1-22. In some of them the subsoil rises about '60 m. above the level of the adjoining street and there is no depth of soil; the whole northern half of the house is much destroyed and was only superficially excavated. 40 contained a remarkable deposit of 59 small Kamires vases, resting on the raised subsoil; they must have been protected by a floor above them of which no trace remains. Ten of them are .777-77777777-,777777~777m777'7 T 7777777 MODERN SURFACE WALL ALOOR V LEVEL -- -_---__-_-,_--- -MYCENAEAN--- - - SHERDs -. - .. , 2OM- -, _- - -T , - --------_-. - 2-7S,' M/ - - - - WALL~ FLOoRLeVEL~ VIRGIN SOIL FIG. 6.-DIAGRAM SHEWING STRATIFICATION OF PIT IN G 3. jugs with bridged spouts, the remainder beaked jugs, cups, and tumblers (see Mr. Dawkins' remarks, p. 307 below, and Fig. 7). 42 contained a trough with three cup-like depressions, possibly a 'table of offerings,' since near it was a miniature pair of horns (Fig. 2, in foreground), and two pieces of stalactite brought perhaps from some cave-sanctuary. 43 yielded a big clay scoop, and 47 part of a steatite lamp and of a steatite cruet-stand with three cups and a loop- handle. 43 and 47 have floors of pebble-concrete, and in the latter there is a central column-base. R. C. BOSANQUET.</page><page sequence="17">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 1 5.-THE HOUSES. BLOCK 7. Block y lies South of /3 on the other side of the main street. An L-shaped area, nearly 900 sq. metres, has been uncovered. Rooms 1--12 form the most important house in the block. The entrance, which faces the centre of the fagade of Block f/, and part of the vestibule were uncovered in 1902. The facade of this house, as far as it is preserved, is built of large squared freestone blocks. On the left-hand side of the entrance they have been removed, yet enough of the sill-course remains to shew that the house-wall had several insets, and these insets occur at the places where the partition walls, that divide the rooms inside, meet the main wall. This massive style is confined to the front wall, where it was adopted to present a fine appearance on the main street. Immediately inside the threshold with its plinth and finely squared freestone blocks on both sides is a small vestibule with a recess on the left, containing a stone bench, under which passes a drain, and a threshold on the right. Facing us is a fine threshold; at each end of it is a pivot-hole, perhaps as at Tiryns once lined with bronze. This being the main door of the house the vestibule was like a porch. An earthenware bath-tub was found here in 190o2. Passing through these doors we turn to the left, and passing the foot of the stairs, find ourselves in 8, a central room (megaron ?), floored with the usual pebble-concrete, from which access is gained to the other rooms. Near the remains of a slab pavement are two circular pillar bases, the only remains of the four that no doubt once existed here. This megaron was the scene of considerable alterations at a relatively late period. As it exists now, the western half is filled up by the stairs and a small room adjoining them, the walls of which served to support a landing or second flight. This room can hardly have been directly lighted. It is thus natural that a fine steatite lamp of the usual two-wicked type was found in it. Two toy vases were also found here. These structures which stand free, all but one corner, in the megaron, and whose walls do not run square with the walls of this latter, were shewn to be an addition to the original plan of the house. The clue to this discovery was found in clearing out the narrow passage left behind the stairs. In this passage three steps were found leading down in the direction of the front door of the house. Behind the topmost step the clay floor was found to be full of pottery. When this</page><page sequence="18">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 291 pottery was being cleared out, the space it occupied was found to run under the central room, and eventually a square walled recess was excavated situated under the floor of this room. Removing the masonry from the north corner of the central room, we found that the walled recess was a room to which the steps first found had led down. One descended the steps, turned to the right, and one more step brought one into this lower room. It was in fact a bath-room of the type discovered last year in f 3. When the stairs were constructed the bath-room was filled up, partly by a wall which ran along its North side, and partly by packing, which, fortunately for us, consisted largely of pottery. Then on the foundation thus formed the stairs and the room adjoining them were built. A similar example of a bath-room so curiously close to the centre of the house is afforded by the Queen's Megaron at Knossos, and also by the Throne-room at the same place. Rooms 4-8 contained nothing of interest, except a triton-shell on the floor of 6. A door from the vestibule leads by a crooked passage to 2 which had a cement pavement. From the megaron rooms 9 and 10 are reached, both well paved, the former with cement, the latter with stone slabs. A list of the vases found in 9 will give an idea of the contents of a productive room. It contained four amphorae ranging in height from "35 to '40 m., unpainted except for rough splashes of black; the open-mouthed painted amphorae shewn in Fig. 18, p. 319; two large pseudamphorae, one decorated with stripes on the shoulder and "42 m. high. These vases were found clustered together. Besides these there were a three- handled pithos about "7o m. high, painted in the degenerate Mycenaean style, and a tankard-shaped mug. A 'spit-rest,' a pestle, and a black cowrie shell complete the list. Room 11 seems to have been a courtyard formed by the space between different houses. From it a passage leads to 12, which opens on the street, and thus forms a side-entrance to this house, to which, rather than to the following, room 20 as it opens on the passage also belongs. Rooms 13-22 plainly formed another house, with one entrance from 13 into the main street. A paved structure in this room may be the bottom of a flight of stairs giving access to upper rooms. As the walls stand, however, the system 14-18 can only be entered from 22, a region which now presents the appearance of one large room; further excavation southwards may make the plan clearer. The region has suffered from the removal of ashlar blocks, and old workmen remember this area as having yielded many of these for building material. 22 was extremely fertile inl fine Kamires ware (see p. 307) which was found immediately above the virgin soil. The finest vases came from a specially deep pocket, but outside of this the deposit was much confused, probably owing to the disturbance of the soil by the removal of stones. 16 yielded good painted plaster. This occurred almost everywhere on the site, but these fragments are noteworthy, because they possess all the colours found, arranged in stripes-white, dark and light blue, yellow, crimson, orange, and a dark Pompeian red. Green has not been found. This room also yielded a piece of a fine thin-walled steatite basin (diamr. over "20 m.) decorated round the rim with an incised double zigzag "30 m. Rooms 23-32 form another house, which opens from 24 on the paved lane between y and E. Near the door are the stairs, and under them a small room or cupboard, as in the megaron of the first house. The two ashlar blocks at the corners of this little room were part of the supports of the landing. The example U2</page><page sequence="19">292 R. M. DAWKINS of / 22, which is a similar cupboard underneath the stairs, might lead one to expect here a store of vases. A fine painted fragment and a clay animal from the bottom of a cup are however the only finds noted, besides, as under the stairs built over the bath-room in the first house, a clay lamp, which is a natural thing to find in a place that must always have been dark. In the rooms N. of the entrance are traces of earlier walls. To 27 no door has been found. 26, 28-32 cannot be entered from the street, and may belong to some unexcavated house on the West. In 32 was found a large tub like one in f 37, and in 30 a pair of electrum earrings. The quantity of black earth in this room testified to the destruction of the house by fire. Rooms 33-38.--33-36 have no external entrarce. 37 and 38 may perhaps have been some kind of shop. The whole width of 37 is open to the street. A double entrance, with door-jambs of the usual form, leads into the inner room, in which were four pithoi, one lying on its side across the others. Another contained peas in a carbonised state. With these was a painted Mycenaean lipped cup, the mouth of which was closed with a strainer. On a ledge on the North wall is a stone sink, connected with a conduit of channelled blocks, which runs through the outer room and, making a double turn under the corner of the wall, empties itself into the street. The channel is covered with stone slabs. This sink and drain, together with the jars, and a collection of four small stone pierced blocks of similar size, that were probably weights, make it clear that the rooms were used for some industrial purpose. The outer and inner rooms suggest the combination of shop and store-room that one sees now in Cretan towns. Rooms 39-4~6.-To make these rooms clear more excavation is needed. 39 opens on the street, as if leading into a house. 40 and 41 were stores of common pottery; 40 especially containing large numbers of small plain cups. 1 6.-BLOCK 8. This block, although not fully uncovered, is already the largest yet found (area 18oo00 sq. m ). It contains several houses, one being in point of architecture the finest yet found. Unfortunately this excellence has led to much destruction, for the freestone blocks used in the best walls are prized as building material by the modern inhabitants. In consequence much of this insula, especially the West end, is completely ruined. There has also been much rebuilding, by which the level has been raised. Thus the fine pavement of the main street in front of this block is secondary: the earlier street was at the level of the bottom of the gutter, which is in fact formed of the part of the earlier pavement left uncovered by the construction of the new way. Rooms 1-16.-The plan is hard to make out, because of the absence of door- ways. In 1, 7, and 10 there were walls of an earlier house. Rooms 8-16 make up a fairly clear house, with a door on Street y-8. Near the entrance are the stairs.</page><page sequence="20">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 293 3 and 4 stand out clear and square amongst the irregularities of the surrounding walls, 4 being of special interest, because from it came the big find of painted 'fillers' described below. These were all close together, resting on a floor of con- crete, within a few inches of the surface, and the ploughshare must for years have almost broken off the points of the long conical pillars, which were resting on their large ends. Rooms 46-48 form a house entered from the side-street, much ruined and not completely excavated. R. of the entrance is a mass of earlier wall, over which passes an additional doorway to 16 in the house described above. The street by the door and further S. contained at a lower level than the threshold a great deal of Kamaires pottery, contemporary with that from the cemeteries; this deposit will be discussed below (p. 304). It is probable that when the later house was built, the site was levelled up with the debris of older structures; the lifting of the pavement in Room 32 disclosed Kamires sherds. Outside the main threshold is the usual recessed seat. In 45 were half a dozen large pear-shaped pseudamphorae. Rooms 18-40 shew the most interesting architectural features in the block, and here also the process of rebuilding can be traced most clearly. The main feature of the earlier house was the megaron (19), with its four pillars at the corners of a square unpaved space, all lying below the floor-level of the later house. The foundation of its; western wall can be traced, broken by two doorways with ashlar jambs of the usual type. Part of its southern wall runs under the later wall of 25, and probably under the pavement of 26. The limit towards the street is shewn on the plan by dotted lines; its position was fixed by the only actual remains, two doorjambs, one at each corner. It was thus a room about 5 m. square. The entrance, now concealed by later structures, must have been on the main street, from 20 or 21. The square pillar, faced with plaster, found in 20, stood in the outer court near the entrance. 18 was an inner room only accessible by passing through the megaron. Near by are numerous other traces of the earlier house. The northern part of room 28 is at a higher level than the other half; so also 26 is higher than 27. In room 29 there are remains of walls at a lower level than the remains of pavement. The amount of slab pavement at both levels, but especially at the higher, is very noticeable. The three pillar bases in 20 must, from the irregularity of their position, have fallen from an upper floor. Further, of the two of them that shew taper, one tapers upwards, the other downwards. One is much disintegrated by fire, and bedded on charcoal; there are many other indications that the first house was destroyed by fire. When the second house was built, the megaron was covered up, and a fresh entrance was made at a higher level. The level of the street was also raised; to this period must also belong all the fine facade from 20 to 36. The fagade of 18 is probably of the older period, as it is not parallel with the edge of the gutter as the rest is. The level of 21 was raised by packing it with stone blocks; thus an entrance was made at a higher level, to which a slab fixed across the gutter served as a bridge. To this later structure belongs the impluvium 23, a paved space 31 m. square, surrounded by a higher pavement. That it was open to the sky is shewn by the fact that it has a drain running down to the street, along the West side of 21, and emptying itself into the gutter just on the right hand side of the door. This drain, like that in y 37, is made of stones channelled out, and seems under the pavement of the later, and above that of the earlier house. The paved square in 40, formed of two huge slabs, may have been a similar impluvium, but this part of</page><page sequence="21">294 R. M. DAWKINS the house is much destroyed. 34, 35, 36 on the right of the doorway have no entrances. Further, the inner side of the front wall is not faced at all, but left perfectly rough. Considering also the rise of level, it seems likely that these were massive substructures rather than rooms. Room 38 was remarkable for the discovery of two large standard lamps and a highly polished lamp-stand of steatite. The finest lamp was 43 m. high, the shaft being decorated with bold mouldings, the other "28 m. high and "30 m. in diameter. The lamp-stand ended at the top in a flat table with ear-handles. Fragments of a white limestone base were also found; this had four perforations, and was probably the lower part of a lamp-stand. The most westerly part of the block yet excavated shews remains of a doorway facing W. and a good deal of pavement at two levels is preserved, but most of the walls have disappeared. S7.-BLOCKS e AND o. In Block E at least five houses can be clearly made out. It is triangular and covers about 760 sq. m. It is separated from / by a narrow lane that runs up the hill from the main street, from o by a narrow, crooked, lane and from the unexcavated Block " by a straight, well-paved street. This street, as running level, has no gutter like the lanes that lead down to the main street on both sides of e. Rooms 1-18.--This house occupies the northern part of the block, where the ground slopes downwards to the main street, from which it is entered by two steps, leading into a vestibule (2) with a stone bench on the left and a door on the right. The earth in this region was very thin and the exact position of the doors was lost. The left-hand suite of rooms (4-7) could only be entered from room 3; otherwise they are entirely shut off from the rest of the house. Owing to the slope of the ground the two lower rooms of this suite are reached by steps. Room 4 goes deeper than the others, the subsoil having been cut away. It contained an immense mass of pottery. Besides sixteen bowls, some of them painted with Mycenaean running patterns, and cups of various shape, there were no less than 980 of the small handleless unpainted cups so common in Mycenaean houses- by far the largest hoard of them found in any room. Room 4 contained the bottom of a clay bath-tub, like those sometimes used for interments. Another find of note was made in the passage between 10 and 1---four large vases of the form shewn in p. 324, Fig. 24, No. 4. Rooms 18-20.-This small house lies S. of the last, and opens on the paved lane 'y-e. Wedged in between two larger houses, it consists of only three rooms. In 18, which was well paved with slabs, two saddle-querns were found standing on projecting masses of masonry. As an open-mouthed pithos was found standing below each of them, they were probably in situ. Rooms 21-28 occupy the S.WV. corner of E. Some earlier walls beneath them require further investigation. The fine concrete floor and pavement in the two halves of 24 point to this having been the best part of the house, just as the stone trough and saddle-quern and coarse pottery found in 28 suggest that this, furthest from the front door, was the kitchen.</page><page sequence="22">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 295 Rooms 29-35 are built on the remains of an earlier structure, the walls of which are especially prominent near the entrance, which is in the street e-(. The fagade is of ashlar masonry, the only instance of this style in the whole block. Remains of a later house were also found at a slightly higher level, so that here there is evidence of three distinct periods of habitation. This later house may be Hellenic (a fragment of geometric pottery occurred in it), and connected with the later temple on this site. This eastern area of the town is also the one where all the high-level finds of Hellenic objects were made. The lowest house will belong to the earliest period of the habitation of the site, the period of the Kamares style, called by Mr. Evans 'Middle Minian,' whilst the second house, to which the bulk of the remains belong, is clearly contemporaneous with the rest of the town, and is therefore Mycenaean. To the earliest house probably belonged a remarkable vase found in room 32, a clumsily made tall Kamires amphora, with handles high on the shoulder, roughly decorated with stripes of white paint. This characteristically early shape is illustrated by the vase on the right in B.S.A. vii. p. irI, Fig. 4. In the S.E. corner of the Mycenaean house (room 29) was found a winepress, with the bed and receptacle for the must preserved-a remarkable discovery. The bed of the press was underneath the corner of the latest house, appearing on both sides of the wall of this latter. It is supported on two sides by the house wall, and on a third by a wall built out for this purpose. On the fourth side it slopes down to a pithos, which is built into the fine hard plaster of the bed to its lip. Into this pithos the juice would flow off the slightly sloping bed. Just between the bed of the press and the wall above it, two or three clay lamps were found of the characteristically Mycenaean type shewn in p. 326, Fig. 27, No. I, a discovery which clearly dates the House of the Winepress. In 33 was found the lip of a steatite cup, bearing four linear signs. Between these houses and the eastern limit of the block is a region whose plan has not been clearly made out. Here also there are remains of a later house at a higher level, though not so well preserved. At the extreme corner of the block the fifth house opens to the main street. Crossing the threshold, one finds oneself in a vestibule, from which a paved passage leads to the right into the other rooms of the house. In this arrangement of the entrance, this house is like the first one in this block. Facing the front door was a narrow flight of five steps. In this vestibule were found a strainer of the common type shewn in last year's report (B.S.A. viii. p. 309, Fig. 22, No. I4), and the fragments of a steatite lamp destroyed by fire. Of the action of fire this vestibule shewed abundant traces in the shape of charcoal and the red earth that is formed of burnt and disintegrated brick. Across the paved passage that leads from the vestibule runs one of the walls of the later house, which, like the one above the House of the Winepress, is to be connected with the later Hellenic Temple. Only '30 m. above the Mycenaean pottery, which choked the narrow paved lane that runs up just past the entrance of this house, was found a fragment of a bronze tripod. A fragment of another of different pattern had been found in 190o2 in the main street outside /3 15. BLOCK o. The last of this block,that has been excavated,lies opposite to block 6 on the other side of the crooked lane r-o. It consists of a raised knoll of rocky subsoil between this lane and the cul-de-sac formed by the continuation of Street E-$. On the top of this knoll rests a single square room. The slopes up to it are piled irregularly</page><page sequence="23">296 EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II with stones. Here were found a number of rough flat-bottomed unpainted jugs of early type (see p. 322, Fig. 2 1). In this point this building resembles /f 40, which also lies directly on a knoll of rock and contained early vases. It would seem likely that in these places any later buildings would have risen so high as to have been quite destroyed. The character of the pottery in any case shews that we have here buildings dating from the earliest period of the town. The cul-de-sac to the South of this building rises towards its end, and is roughly paved with cobblestones, highly polished by wear. It must at some period of the town's history have formed a thoroughfare, perhaps at the time when the deposit on o was laid down. Its present condition is quite enigmatic. The removal of the surface soil revealed the existence of more buildings to the south-east, but these have not been followed up. R. M. DAWKINS.</page><page sequence="24">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. S8.-TIE POTTERY. 1 I.-A very great quantity of pottery has been found in the two seasons' work at Palaikastro. It will give an idea of the amount to say that in the season of 1903 about 650 vases were found more or less complete, of which 160 come from the cemeteries and the rest from the houses. In addition the Roussolakkos site yielded great quantities of fragments. From fifty to eighty baskets full were brought in daily. All the sherds were washed, a record kept of their nature, and the more interesting kept as samples. The rest were piled in labelled heaps for future reference or search. In giving an account of this pottery it will be best to follow as far as possible a chronological order in dealing with the various fabrics. Both in this and in other ways, Dr. Mackenzie's article, 'The Pottery of Knossos,' J.H.S. xxiii. p. 157, which has been followed here as closely as possible, has cleared the way very much. The article on the 'Pottery from Zakro,' J.H.S. xxiii. p. 248, was unfortunately written before it appeared. Setting down in chronological order the places from which the pottery came, we have:- I. The cave-burials of H. Nikolaos, with their hand-made pottery of very early shapes. II. The Kamires cemeteries. These include (a) The burials on the gravel ridge described in B.S.A. viii. p. 290. These as a whole are the earliest of all. (b) The large bone-enclosure, shewn in B.S.A. viii. p. 291, Fig. 5. (c) The bone-enclosure at Patema.</page><page sequence="25">298 R. M. DAWKINS III. The early deposits, five in number, on the Roussolakkos site. It is these deposits that enable us to connect the cemeteries with the town, for the pottery that was in use when the houses were abandoned is very much later than this, and belongs to an advanced stage of Mycenaean technique. As the remains of earlier houses are found in many parts of the town, so there occur several of these Kamires deposits. Outside these definite deposits, the good Kamres ware found in the houses was extremely small in quantity, and may very well have come from below the level of later floors. These deposits are:- (a) The low-level stratum of pottery found in G 3, whose position is shewn in Fig. 6, p. 289. This is probably the earliest, for, besides its depth and the character of the Kamires ware, it contained the bulk of the polished thick ware described below. (b) The deposits in 7 22 (p. 291), and in the space outside 8 48 (p. 292) where the street widens. These adjacent deposits also contained ware of the early cemetery types, mixed with vases that appear to be later than the best period of Kamires technique, and resemble those shewn in 'The Pottery of Knossos,' Fig. 6. (c) The early pottery from fi 40 (p. 289), which yielded fifty-nine Kamires vases, consisting of cups and various types of beaked jugs. (e) The small coarse flat-bottomed jugs from Block o. IV. The town floor-deposits, with which go the ware from Kouraminos, from Kastri, and from the beehive-tomb described in B.S.A. viii. p. 303. These vases, as will be seen below, belong some to the best period of the Mycenaean style, some to the period of its decline, when elements of the geometrical style were beginning to appear. Definitely earlier than the latest of these floor-deposits is the pottery in the filled-up bath-room in Block %. V. A few 'geometric' vases from the higher, probably archaic Greek, deposit on the Roussolakkos site. Treating this pottery according to fabric, we have, still following the chronological order: (I) Handmade, unpainted fabrics, from I. II. and III. above; (2) Kamires ware, almost entirely from II. and III.; (3) My- cenaean painted ware, from IV., ranging from the best period to the period of transition, and including the geometric vases of V.; (4) Plain domestic</page><page sequence="26">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 299 ware, which, as it comes mainly from the floor-deposits, is mostly contem- porary with the Mycenaean painted ware. I.-HANDMADE, UNPAINTED FABRICS. 1 2.-Nothing so early as the vases from H. Nikolaos has yet been found in this district. Their' Cycladic' shapes and scanty use of incised ornament have been described below (p. 340). Next in age come some vases from the burials on the western slope of the gravel ridge near the town. This yielded a little ware, either incised or decorated with impressed triangles, which, by the position in which it was found, connects the H. Nikolaos vases with the succeeding Kamares period. One of these vases of globular shape with suspension holes has been figured in last year's report (B.S.A. viii. p. 290, Fig. 3), where the deposit is fully described. A further link is furnished by the little lid (Fig. I, No. 14) from the large bone-enclosure, which was clearly made to be tied on as a cover, like the hat-shaped lids of the H. Nikolaos vases. But Palaikastro has not yet yielded satisfactory ceramic evidence to bridge the gap by shewing the transition from the incised to the painted style. It is worth while to notice the comparative elegance and fineness of the early unpainted ware of Palaikastro, and its agreement in these points with that of Zakro, described by Mr. Hogarth in B.S.A. vii. p. 142. In both places also two fabrics are found. The first has a burnished surface, and its decoration consists of finely incised lines or scratches: in the second the markings are more softly engraved on a dull surface. The vase from the cemetery figured in the first report (B.S.A. viii. p. 290, Fig. 3) is of this second kind. No fragment of the coarser handmade ware of the earlier Knossian strata has been found at these sites, which also as yet lack the very early painted ware found at Knossos and classified by Dr. Mackenzie as Early Min6an. Specimens are shewn in 'The Pottery of Knossos,' J.H.S. xxiii. p. 167, Fig. I. The inference seems to be that the unpainted handmade pottery continued to be made here later than at Knossos, and had time to develop to greater elegance, and that then the fully developed polychrome Kamires technique was introduced at one sweep, without passing through the primitive stage presented at Knossos by the Early Min6an period.</page><page sequence="27">300 R. M. DAWKINS The deep deposit in square G 3 yielded many fragments of a very thick polished brown ware, which, except for a few sherds in y 22, was not found elsewhere. It was handmade, the clay being of a ruddy brown, and containing many particles of some white substance. The polished surface was of a rich chestnut-brown colour. The fragments seem to be of large dishes, but it was impossible to make up any shape. A big handle and one big lug were found. From its position it was clearly contemporaneous with Kamires ware of the best technique. It shews the older unpainted style surviving for household purposes alongside of the newer painted style adopted for the finer vessels. On the town site was found the spout of a handmade vase of grey clay, exactly like the one from Syros figured in 'Eh. 'ApX. 1899, P1. 9, No. 8. 2.-KAMARES WARE. 1 3.-The distinguishing mark of this fabric, of which much has been found at Palaikastro, is, as is now well known, the method of covering the vase with a coat of black lustrous glaze-paint, and painting a design on this in matt colours, chiefly white, which is in the best period helped out by other colours, red or even yellow, the result being a fine polychrome effect. Characteristic also, though rare at Palaikastro, is the use of plastic decoration. Except for the handmade vases mentioned above, and a certain amount of plain domestic ware mainly from Patema, the vases from the cemeteries are all of this fabric. So also are those from the early deposits in the town, again with the natural exception of the rougher household vessels. In a degenerate form it is also found in the later houses, the older style lingering on for such small objects as cups. These later vases also have a thinner, poorer glaze, which is often rather red than black, and very carelessly applied, and do not often shew the characteristic white paint. Many of the flat handles of such cups were found in clearing out the streets. This practice of covering the whole vessel with black survives in fact until geometric times, when vases black all over except for a decorated panel reappear in considerable numbers. The Kamires white paint, on the other hand, survived on more honoured vases to be an added beauty of the Cretan Mycenaean style.</page><page sequence="28">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 301 These vases fall under three of the four main classes under which Dr. Mackenzie 1 has classified the fine ware of the 'Middle Min6an' period: cups, spouted jugs of different kinds, amongst which are the holemouthed vases with bridged spouts, and, rarely, 'fruit-stands.' 1 4.-Here, as elsewhere, cups of various types form the great majority of the vases found. So common are they that it is possible by their means to get at some chronological classification of this fabric, and to shew how its later forms were taken up by the potters of the succeeding Mycenaean period. These cups, then, fall into two groups, according as they are found in the cemeteries and early town deposits, or occur in the later town houses. Any exclusive characteristics of either group will naturally form a criterion of earliness or lateness respectively which may be applied elsewhere. The groups are as follows :- A. The shapes shewn in Fig. I, and numbered I, I a, 2, 2 a, 3, 4, 5, 5 a. I a and 2 a are variants of I and 2; 5 a very often has a model of an animal on the bottom, a fancy peculiar, as far as I know, to the potters of Palaikastro. These shapes occur only in the cemeteries and in the lower deposits in the town. This establishes the earlier date of this group. Its absolute dating is indicated by certain Egyptian parallels. Thus 4 is a shape characteristic of XIIth dynasty alabaster vases, which, however, often have rims and lids. Shape 2 a without its handle appears among the XIIth dynasty pottery kindly shewn me at Benihasan by Mr. Garstang. The Egyptian parallels to the cups with an animal inside appear to have a wider range. Characteristic features of this group of shapes are these;- (a) The use of red paint, which amongst the cups is practically confined to these shapes, hardly indeed going beyond I, 4, and 5 a. This agrees with the evidence from Knossos (J.H.S. xxiii. p. 180), that the polychrome design tends to become monochrome, light design on a dark ground. (b) The bases of these cups, when flat, as they with one or two exceptions always are, shew parallel striations, as if the cup had been separated from the clay still on the wheel by some straight cutting instrument. These parallel striations always appear, although sometimes 1 'Pottery of Knossos,'J.-H.S. xxiii. p. I7I.</page><page sequence="29">302 R. M. DAWKINS 1 2 6 tr 7 8 90 10 11~l 12. 1 3 FIG.

II. 303 a little smoothed out, and, as they are never found in any vase from later deposits, may be regarded as an indication of an early date. Later vases with flat bases shetv the curved concentric striations made by the use of a string to separate the freshly made cup. These markings are illustrated in 'Pottery from Zakro,' J.H.S. xxiii. p. 249, Fig. 2. (c) The careful welding of the lower end of the handle into the side of the cup. Contrast Fig. I, No. I I. (d) The remarkable depth of shape 4 and the allied vase shewn in Fig. 2, also point to an early date. For this see'Pottery of Knossos,' p. 166, and the vase shewn there in Fig. I, No. 7, p. 167, which presents a FIG. 2.-CUP FROM KAMARES CEMETERY. (Scale I : 2.) 1 z FIG. 3.-KAMARES CUPS. (Scale I :4.) shape almost identical with that of the cup shewn here in Fig. 3, No. I. Like that of the Knossian cup in question the base of the cup shewn here in Fig. 2 is not flat, but hollowed out like that of a wine bottle. Cups of shapes varying between 6, 6 a, and 6 b, are very common in the cemeteries. The base generally has the straight, but not infrequently the concentric, striations of the later period. The shape in fact never disappeared, and is the parent of the common little Mycenaean unpainted cups, of which so many were found in the later houses, as indeed on all Mycenaean sites. These earlier Kamires examples are, however, as at Knossos, of much finer workmanship. It is to be noted, however, that red</page><page sequence="31">304 R. M. DAWKINS paint is not used in the decoration of these cups, which are in general quite plain. B. The shapes of Fig. I, numbered 7, 8, 9, Io, I I, II a, I2. Of these II and I I a are cups of the Vaphio type, varying in the sharpness of the angle at the bottom. As a rule the earlier the cup the sharper and neater the angle. There is also a good deal of variation in the steepness and curve of the sides. This group of forms is found not only in the cemeteries, but in the later houses as well, the commonest shape in these latter being II a, the coarser variety of the Vaphio type. This relative lateness is confirmed by (a) The absence of red paint from their decoration, which is besides generally not so good in pattern. (b) The striations on the base are never straight, but invariably of the concentric type produced by a string. (c) The glaze-ground is commonly not so good, and is very frequently of a red colour. (d) 12 is already a Mycenaean form. Without its handle it is exactly 13, which is a very common type of Mycenaean bowl, of which large numbers were found in, amongst other places, the filled-in bath-room in Block 7. No. 7 looks early, and no examples seem to have been found outside the cemetery, but the attachment of the handle and the invariably poor glaze are both signs of lateness. 1 5.-How does this bear on the chronological relations between the town and the cemeteries? Of the early deposits in the town, those in Block o and fi 40 are floor-deposits; those in y 22 and outside the door of 8 47 are of the nature of filling, and a good deal confused; only that in G 3 presents the character of a regular undisturbed stratum of pottery that must have been formed continuously and have never been moved. From the prevalence in this stratum of vases of the types of Nos. I and 4 (Fig. I), and the discovery there of a cup so typical of the earliest cemetery forms as the vase from which No. 2 (Fig. I) has been drawn, and also from the absence of later types of Kamares cups and still more of Mycenaean painted ware, one may conclude that this, the deepest and earliest deposit on the town-site, is contemporary with the earliest burials. The absence of cups of the second class (see Fig. I, Nos. 7-12, and</page><page sequence="32">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 305 description) from this deposit is additional evidence for the time-separation of the two classes of Kamires cups. II )2 3 I0I;. 4.-KAMARES CUPS. (Scale 1:3.) The cemeteries thus were in use when the town site was first settled, and continued to be used until after the introduction of new types of pottery, types which survived into the later period of the town's career, FIG. 5.--KAMXRES CUPS AND JUGS. (Scale about I :4-5.) when these cemeteries had gone out of use. From the occurrence in the cemetery at Patema of a few domestic vases of forms found in the later x</page><page sequence="33">306 R. M. DAWKINS town, it may be inferred that occasional burials-perhaps, from the plainness of the vases, burials of poor people-went on here later than in the other cemetery. But as domestic ware is likely to continue unaltered longer than more ornate fabrics, too much stress should not be laid on this. Had these cemeteries not gone out of use early, for prosperous people at all events, Mycenaean vases, which as it is are conspicuous by their absence, would have been found. The citizens of the Mycenaean period buried their dead in Xdpva'ce. The decoration of these cups is often extremely pretty. Specimens of them together with a few other small vases of miscellaneous shapes have been published in last year's report, Figs. 7, 9, IO, and 17, and others are shewn here in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, a, b, c, d. The hatching indicates red paint, the white white paint, and the black shews the ground of black glaze-paint. With the exception of the leaves in Fig. 4, No. 3, no naturalistic patterns occur; all are strictly conventional. The festoon and the single-coil spiral are very characteristic. The running spiral of Fig. 5, d, is very rare; not that running spirals in white paint are not common enough, but they occur almost always on vases painted when the Mycenaean style had come to the fore, and the use of white was preserved as a survival of the older style. 1 6.-The Kam~ires beaked jugs were all of the form shewn in Fig. 22, No. 2. All were ornamented with white stripes, generally vertical FIG. 6.-KAMARES ' HOLE-MOUTHED' JAR. (Scale I : 3.) on the body, surrounding the neck like a collar, and again repeated under the spout (Fig. 5, e-h). Six of these were found. The other</page><page sequence="34">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 307 beaked jugs will be discussed below in the section on domestic pottery. Here, as generally in Crete, there are two forms of hole-mouthed Kamires vases with bridged spouts. One is that shewn in Fig. 6, with two handles and the body tapering downwards to a foot; the other is the type with one vertical handle opposite the spout, shewn in Fig. 7, No. 2. Fig. 7, No. I shews the form that is probably the ancestor of these vases. It was among the very early vases found on the gravel ridge. The clay is red, and the surface polished and not painted. It is handmade. Besides these points, the antiquity of the form is also attested by its appearance amongst the Early Min6an vases from Knossos (see 'Pottery of Knossos,' Fig. I, Nos. 8, 1o, 12), and a vase with a similar spout has been. found among the Cycladic ware from Syros ('E4. 'Apx. 1899, P1. 9, No. 14). A 1 2 FIG. 7.-EARLY SPOUTED JUGS. (Scale I :2.) fine Kamfires vase from H. Triidha near Phaistos, to which I am allowed to refer by the kind permission of Professor Halbherr, supplies the connecting link. Similar in all other respects to the vases shewn in Fig. 7, Nos. I and 2, it has a spout that is exactly half-way between them. Since this parent-form is of the one-handled type, it is likely that this is the older of the two. Developing a neck it survived as the form shewn in Fig. 12, though as a hole-mouthed vase it was long outlived by the type with two horizontal handles, which lasted as a common form well into the Mycenaean age. Also an example of the one-handled type from the cemetery had a fine, though much ruined, decoration of white and red. It sometimes has a foot: probably the footless form is the older. 1 7.-Of 'fruit-stands ' 7 22 yielded one stem, with much perished white paint, and one splendid complete example (Fig. 8), a beautiful X2</page><page sequence="35">308 R.

Before passing on it should be added that two plain black fragments of very thin eggshell Kamires ware were found in 9y 22, which also yielded a few fragments of the ware with plastic decoration.</page><page sequence="36">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 309 3.-MYCENAEAN PAINTED WARE. 1 8.-This section and the following on the household pottery comprise, with the exception of the few degenerate Kam~ires forms, all the vases from the later town, and from the sites mentioned above under the fifth heading. This amounts to at least five-sixths of the total pottery found. The painted Mycenaean ware ranges from that of the best period to that of the period of decline, which in Crete leads by gradual steps to the fully developed geometric style. That painted vases of varying date should be found together, or at least in the same town, is not surprising, for such objects would be of considerable value, and so be carefully preserved. Thus, whilst very many of the vases were of the decadent period, the finds of vases shewing the Mycenaean technique at its best were numerous and important. That the floor-deposits however do not go back to a very early date in the Mycenaean period is shewn by the scarcity of the ripple-motive (' Pottery of Knossos,' p. i6O), which from its origin must be regarded as a characteristically early Mycenaean pattern. No whole vases shewing this were found ; it occurred on a good many fragments from the well in /3 4 (B.S.A. viii. p. 311). In strong contrast to this is the frequency of this ripple-motive on the Mycenaean ware which was found mixed up with clearly contemporaneous Kam~ires cups in the pits at Zakro (' Pottery from Zakro,' J.H.S. xxiii. p. 25). Thus, whilst the pottery from the Zakro houses is contemporary with that of the Roussolakkos floor-deposits of /3 1-22, 8 4 and 5 18, that from the pits exhibits an earlier stage which is as yet but slightly represented at Palaikastro. (See however the account on p. 284 above of the earlier stratum in / 10 and 13.) 1 9.-A cylindrical vase with a perforated star on each side, and a pair of horizontal handles near the rim, may however be regarded as belonging to a slightly earlier period than the deposits in /3 1-22 and 5 4 (excluding lower strata in / 10-13). It belongs to the early Mycenaean period when the Kamares technique of light on dark was being thrust into the background by the development of its dark-on-light Mycenaean rival, if one may judge from its bearing a certain resemblance both in</page><page sequence="37">31o R. M. DAWKINS shape and naturalistic style of decoration to the beautiful lily vase figured in 'Pottery of Knossos,' p. 189, Fig. 8. The ground is a rich red ; the decoration consists of a bull's head on each side, between whose horns a double axe is suspended, whilst from between the perforations spring branches of star-shaped flowers. It is the natural treatment of these flowers in pure white that so strongly recalls the Knossian vase above cited. Its fragments were found in clearing out the large megaron (18) of the earlier house in Block 8. A very similar vase was found in 1902 amongst the pottery in ,3 10. Its decoration was much ruined. It is shewn in B.S.A. viii. Pl. XVII. No. 5. Io.-Of the best Mycenaean period the finest vases were the group of fillers, which are mentioned above as having been found in 8 4. In all, there were 17 of these, of which 13 can be almost completely made up. They are of two shapes. One is conical with a large, bold handle (Fig. 9) this is the shape of the vase carried by the cup-bearer of Knossos. The other (Fig. Io) is pear-shaped, with a narrow neck, small handle, and projecting lip. Of exactly the same shape is the filler, from Zakro, published by Mr. Hogarth, J.H.S. xxii. p. 333, and P1. XII. The technique also is identical. This shape is everywhere much rarer than the conical type, which has been found at Gournii in considerable numbers, and has occurred in stone at Knossos and H. Triidha. All are covered with a fine ruddy yellow slip, and decorated with a lustrous paint that varies from red to black. They are in all cases pierced at the bottom? The pear-shaped fillers are, as Mr. Bosanquet has pointed out 2 in connexion with the Zakro vase, very closely akin to the Keftiu shape, from the Rekhmara tomb, figured by W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 340. The nipple at the bottom of the Keftiu vase points very decidedly to its having been pierced. A pierced filler from Phylakopi has a similar though smaller nipple. The motives of the decoration are either conventional or marine, and there is a tendency for the vases to go in pairs. Of the conical fillers, 1 In publishing the filler from Zakro referred to above, Mr. Hogarth has inadvertently stated that it was not pierced at the bottom. As the vase stands now in the Candia Museum the bottom is supplied in plaster. These examples from Palaikastro and others leave no doubt that the Zakro vase also was pierced. 2 'Archaeology in Greece,' 19oo-i,J../S. xxi. p. 339.</page><page sequence="38">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO.

This splendid design occurs also on a hole-mouthed jar from Phaistos, whilst other parallels come from Mycenae 1 (' Pottery of Knossos,' p. 192) and 1 [The upper part of the restored design J.H.S. xxiii. 192 represents the neck of an amphora found by Professor Tsountas in a tomb at Mycenae, along with a more complete one, also restored by Messrs. Marshall and Bagge. The pattern may be derived from a necklace; similar forms appear among the glass-paste ornaments from Mycenae. -R. C. B.]</page><page sequence="39">312 R. M. DAWKINS Phylakopi. Another bears the double axe, with its blades cusped, as if one axe were seen behind another. The design is completed by large rayed stars and shells. The large number of actual triton-shells found, to be used doubtless as trumpets, a practice illustrated on a gem from the Idaean cave (J.H.S. xxi. p. 142, Fig. 25), and by the modern Cretan bypodfbAace9, points to these shells being tritons, rather than murex-shells. At the same time, the finding of murex-shells on Kouphonisi points the other way. Certainty can hardly be reached: perhaps the artist himself hardly knew. Of the other complete examples, two are entirely marine in design and are covered with murex-shells amongst long fronds of seaweed which spring from conventionally indicated rockwork. Two more, of which only the top halves survive, have the same stars, alga, and rockwork. A lower half, which probably belongs to one of these, shews stars and murex- shells. Of the pear-shaped type, one, unfortunately not all preserved, has the rayed star, shells, and long seaweed fronds. This vase must have been almost a pair to the filler from Zakro cited above, which however has not the long swaying fronds of seaweed, which are so graceful a feature in the Palaikastro design. A complete filler of this type is covered with a close pattern of nautilus shells and rockwork ; the remaining four are decorated with a large octopus whose body occupies one side of the vase, whilst his straggling feelers are arranged to cover the rest of the field. The necks of these octopus fillers are decorated with the other marine motives. Three other fillers in fragments, but of much coarser make, come from Block 7. Two have the decoration disposed in bands, like the fillers from Gournid. 1I I.-&amp; 22, the little room under the stairs in Block 3, yielded some fine painted vases. Two had been packed away in big jars which stood around the walls. The good vases were two tall beaked jugs, one of which is shewn in Fig. II, with a pattern of spiral tendrils round the body, a more florid descendant of the tendril pattern on the Zakro bowls (f.H.S. xxiii. p. 249, Figs. I and 3); a four-handled pyxis, a gourd-shaped vase decorated with an octopus and shells on both sides, and a pear-shaped vase with papyrus painted on it. Both of those were of cold greenish-grey clay and slip and very black paint. The mouth of the papyrus vase is closed by a strainer. The size of the bow of the handle, and the way its lower end curves away again</page><page sequence="40">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 313 from the body of the vase, are characteristic of these very fine vases, when the potter's mastery over his material was complete. A three-handled pithos from Thorikos, figured in 'E4b. 'Apx. I895, P1. XI. I, is decorated with a very similar papyrus plant. The gourd-shaped vase painted with an octopus is clearly contemporary with the fillers, and thus the greenish- grey slip and very black paint go with the warm yellow slip and reddish- FIG. II.-MYCENAEAN SPOUTED JUG. (Scale I :3.) brown paint. The difference appears to result simply from the manner of firing. Other vases with this greyish slip and black paint are the three- handled pseudamphora reproduced in last year's report (B.S.A. viii. p. 313) and a large jug with a long bridge spout (p. 285, Fig. 5) from the earlier stratum in 13 10. In these two vases the decoration is more conventional; the fronds of alga, that spring from the rockwork at the bottom of the decorated field on the beaked jug, end in a similar way at the top under</page><page sequence="41">314 R. M. DAWKINS the neck. The natural scheme is thus conventionalised so as to look alike from above and from below. This happens not unfrequently, and this particular alga design degenerated along this line. Among the fine marine vases a fragment shewing a nautilus shell and rockwork must not be passed over. The lines left by the wheel on the inside go in such a direction that it seems probable that this belonged to a large vase with spiral stripes of decoration, like the fine vase from Vaphio, a restoration of which, together with this fragment, is to be published by Mr. Bosanquet. 11I2.-The other painted vases of the fine Mycenaean period fall under the following headings :- I.

A similar vase, though somewhat more squat, was found at Phylakopi. III. Painted bowls, with and without handles (Fig. 13). Of these large numbers were found.

Although its use as 3 FIG, I3.-PAINTED BOWL WITH SPIRAL PATTERN. packing, when the stairs were built, clearly puts it in an earlier period than that of the final desertion of the houses, it nevertheless shews marks of the decadence of the fine style. The characteristics of this stage of Mycenaean pottery are these. As to shape we notice (a) that the pseudamphora is already frequent, and that 1 /2 FIG. 14.-VASES FROM THE BATH-ROOM IN BLOCK y.

As to decoration, we see from the kylix shewn in Fig. 14 that the linear style of later Mycenaean times is beginning. But the most notice- able feature is the slightly mechanical scheme of decoration, in which the field is parcelled out by a rigidly disposed system of lines and thickly covered with patterns, very commonly with rows of leaves set closely FIG. IS.-VASE FROM BATH-ROOM IN BLOCK 'y. (Scale I :3.) together. The effect is rich, though the stiffness and absence of freedom in the drawing place these vases considerably below the achievements of the finest period. Two globular vases in this style were found, one of which is shewn in Fig. I5. The row of spirals and the concentric rings on this vase give it a very close resemblance to a fragment of a vase of the same shape and technique found in the waste-heaps of the Palace of</page><page sequence="44">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 317 Khuenaten at Tell-el-Amarna. The Egyptian example, which is to be dated to about 1400 B.C., is however, to judge from the carelessness of its style, probably somewhat later. In none of the vases of this class does the degenerate polyp or the metopic division of the field yet appear. Leaf patterns in this close style occur also on the two vases shewn in Fig. 16, which were found near the painted lacrax described in B.S.A. 2 1 FIG. I6.-MYCENAEAN VASES IN THE ' CLOSE' STYILE. (Scale I 3.) viii. p. 297. The handle springing from the neck of No. I, and the shape of No. 2, anticipate the coming geometrical style. The shape of the latter occurs at Zakro amongst fully developed geometric pottery. All this pottery, together with the larnax, must be grouped together as giving a picture of the art of Palaikastro, when it was still good, but beginning to decline. The quatrefoil which occurs on the larnaz is a common ornament on late vases. 9 14.-We now come to certain late floor-deposits which represent the pottery of the period of final abandonment. Here the vases in 7 9 figure</page><page sequence="45">318 R. M. DAWKINS largely. Among these vases it is to be noticed that the pseudamphora is common. It is generally a big pear-shaped vessel often decorated with the degenerate polyp ornament, which in its later forms is no more than a waved line. Besides the complete examples found, the numerous tops of these vessels found in clearing the streets testified to its commonness. The tankard-shaped mug (Fig. 12, No. 2 from y 9) is also a characteristically late form, as is shewn both by the company in which it is found, and also by the patterns found on it. Thus we have an example here of a similar form with a frieze of birds (Fig. 17), and the fine example from Psychro FIG. 17.--MUG WIVTH FRIEZE OF BIRDS. (B.S.A. vi. p. 1o3, Figs. 31, 32) has on one side the chequer pattern, and on the other side a polyp, which has strayed so far from nature as to have its feelers ending in tailed spirals. It occurs also in the period of the re- occupation of the Palace of Knossos. The big amphora shewn in Fig. 18 also came from r, 9. Its muddled scheme of ornament, pale grey slip and dull glaze-paint in themselves suggest degeneration. The scheme of ornament shews prominently the principle of dividing the field into panels that plays so great a part in geometrical vase painting. These panels are filled with the carelessly drawn degenerate remains of the patterns of a better period all jumbled together, no one part of the design bearing any relation to the others. A large pithos has this kind of decoration on one side and the wavy lines of the degenerate polyp on the other.</page><page sequence="46">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 319 The vases from the beehive-tomb excavated in 1902 belong to this period. They comprise a bowl resembling those from the bath-room both FIG. IS.-LATE MYCENAEAN AMPHORA. (Scale I:6.) FIG.

One of these is decorated on the shoulder with</page><page sequence="47">320 R. M. DAWKINS conventionalised birds, and on the body with the waving arms of a degenerate polyp or octopus; another is painted with stripes on the body and a decadent ornament above. The late shape of a bronze sword found with the vases confirms their evidence. The very flat Biigelkanne found in this tomb (B.S.A. viii. p. 303, Fig. 19) is, to judge from the clear, clean appearance of its slip and paint, probably an importation. Here also belongs a two-handled bowl (Fig. 19) from Kouraminos. Its grey slip is covered with a linear design in black, that, together with the metopic divisions, contains the quatrefoil motive which is common in this style, and noticed above as occurring on the painted larnaxr. The amphora shewn above in Fig. 18 has it, though it only partly appears in the drawing. Of the same shape and still more geometric style of decor- ations is the bowl from Kastri figured in last year's report (Fig. 2, p. 289). The shape of these two bowls is in fact almost the same as that of the big geometric vases that have been found containing burnt bones. The decor- ation of the Kastri bowl can be paralleled by that of an unpublished vase from the transitional necropolis of Koures. 15.-Of fully geometric style are the seven similar vases (Fig. 20, No.2) that were found together, near the surface, over the south-east end of the main street. They are of a softish grey clay, covered all over with a hardly lustrous black paint. So too, except for the band of pattern, is the one-handled 1 2 FIG. 20.-VASES OF GEOMETRIC PERIOD.

II. 321 4.-DOMESTIC WARE. 16.-Under this head falls all the plain unpainted pottery, which, as is natural in an inhabited site, formed the larger part of the total pottery found. With it come the plain beaked jugs from the cemeteries. Especially large finds of this class of pottery came from /3 10 and /313 which gave specimens of most of the forms (B.S.A. viii. p. 314). The main classes are these: I. Jugs.-The shapes found enable us to trace the development of the later forms of jug from the ' Schnabelkanne' proper, which served for this purpose in the early period of the cemeteries. A series of typical examples is shewn in Fig. 2I. No. I is from the big bone-enclosure. 2 is one of the Kam~ires beaked jugs with white stripes, mentioned above as having been found both in the large cemetery and in the early town- deposits. From its fineness it is perhaps later than I. This shape is the germ of the later jugs. 3 shews a form with the mouth already widened. 4, also from the big cemetery, though above like I and 2, has in its lower part assumed the form of the later jugs. This shape survived, and a fine example in Mycenaean technique was found in the bath-room in Block /3. At this point the series bifurcates, according to the treatment of the mouth. On the one hand the mouth widens, as in 3, and we get 5, a vase whose lateness is shewn by its having been found in Block e, and its decoration in a degenerate Kamres style with a Mycenaean running spiral. It also has the marks of a string on its base. A further widening of the mouth gives us 6, a form common in the houses. On the other line of development, the mouth is not so much widened as pinched on both sides into a trefoil shape, the neck remaining narrow, and the small lobe of the trefoil forming the spout. This, by way of 7, a vase from the cemetery, but whose comparative lateness is indicated by its string-marked base, leads to 8, which is perhaps the commonest form of jug found in the houses. Specially large numbers of them were found in 10 10 and /3 13. A similar series is shewn by the shapes 9, Io, I I. The askos-like jug, itself a form whose earliness is clear, passes by way of 1o, the original of which is from the burials on the gravel ridge, into the little pots, one of V</page><page sequence="49">322 R.

They occur in the early deposit on the gravel ridge, in company with the little vase shewn in Fig. 22, No. I, and others of the early cemetery types (e.g. Fig. 22, No. 4). This first vase (Fig. 22, No. I), with its neck decor- ated by oblique cuts, is identical with several recently found by Mr. Xan- thoudides in a Mycenaean house near Chamizi, in the eparchy of Siteia, whose earliness is vouched for by its other pottery and by the smallness of the stone vessels found.

(b) The more developed form with a bridged spout is rarer (Fig. 27, Nos. 2, 3). It occurs occasionally with the other type at Zakro 1 also, but in the early Mycenaean house referred to above at Chamdzi only the older unbridged type has been found.

A fine example 1 B.S.A. vii. p. 128, Fig. 41 shews a bridged lamp, which however had the handle of the earlier unbridged type. Bridged lamps with horizontal handles like those at Palaikastro were however found in Mycenaean deposits at Zakro.</page><page sequence="55">328 EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. occurred with the pricket-candlestick mentioned above. Also the vase shewn in Fig. 27, No. 4, is probably a lamp. Perhaps the tendency of the outside handle to get broken off suggested to some ingenious potter the idea of putting it where it would be safe inside the bowl. The handle of these vessels, of which several have been found, generally rises above the level of the lip of the cup, so that one could use it without touching the oil. They have been found also at Psychro and Zakro ( f.H.S. xxiii. p. 250, Fig. I13). R. M. DAWKINS.</page><page sequence="56">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 1 9.-KOURAMENOS. IN consequence of the torrential rains which made it impossible to commence work on the Roussolakkos site immediately upon our arrival at Palaikastro, an excavation was carried on from March 23rd to March 28th at a site named Kouram6nos, situated close to the sea-shore about half an hour's walk north of Angathii. Six men were employed on the first day, and an average of twenty-one on the succeeding days. About half a mile N.E. of the Kastri is a flat-topped hill named Rigoviglo, which, extending eastwards almost as far as to the beach, divides the Palaikastro plain into two well-marked portions. Over the crest of this hill there runs a wall, probably ancient, which can be traced in a wide circuit starting immediately below the hill by the sea-shore and returning to the beach at the point where the plain is terminated by the mountains which bound it on the north: in some places it stands several courses high, at others only the foundations are visible. This district must have contained a considerable number of buildings in prehistoric times, for many remains of megalithic walls can still be traced, doubtless belonging to farmsteads of the Mycenaean period. That the circuit-wall was built for purposes of defence does not seem probable: it cannot, to judge from the breadth of its foundations, have reached any great height, and the number of men required to defend a wall of such extent would be very considerable. The more likely explanation is that it served as a boundary to mark off the TrE evoS of some 'king' from the common land of the community, and to prevent the cattle grazing on this latter from straying on to the estate reserved as the private property of the chief.1 1 For a discussion of the Homeric land-system, see Prof. Ridgeway's article in J.H.S. VI. 319 foil.</page><page sequence="57">330 DAWKINS AND TOD At the N.W. corner of the plain there are indications of Venetian occu- pation in the form of a reservoir built of small stones and mortar, with the remains of an aqueduct leading to it from the side of the hill, which we were told had been cut in order to bring down water from the plateau of Toplu. Higher up the slope were the ruins of a large, vaulted building of similar construction, which perhaps served as a dep6t for the produce of KOURAMEN OS 'lHOUSE r W E ROUSE G s OOUISf Eg OUSE HO hcn FIG. I.-PLAN OF BUILDINGS AT KOURAMINOS (I : 5oo.) the plain, in the same way as the modern store built close to the sea at the southern foot of the Kastri. Within this area our attention was especially called to a field owned by the monastery of Toplu, but cultivated for many years past by the dyer of Palai- kastro, Jannis Brilakes. Indica- tions of walls were visible in several places, and a number of stones taken from ancient build- ings have been used to construct a breakwater to prevent the over- flow of a neighbouring stream; a large door-sill of Cavo Sidhero stone had also been recently turned up by the plough. This evidence, and that of several large stones which shewed above the surface, led us to begin excavations at this point, and a complex of walls was presently laid bare, which proved to belong to a group of buildings running parallel to the sea-shore and divided into two main blocks, situated close together but seemingly unconnected. The shore, which here consists of a narrow and rapidly shelving beach running north and south, lies about 25 metres E. of the eastern wall of the large megaron of House C (see Fig. I), and forms the centre of a fine bay bounded on the</page><page sequence="58">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 331 south by the Kastri, on the north by the hills which terminate the Palai- kastro plain, the distance between them being a little less than a mile. The Constriuction of the Houses.-Though there is no wall which can be strictly called megalithic, yet a good many large blocks of stone have been used in the construction, especially at the corners. The gap in the north-eastern corner of the megaron of House C is clearly due to the removal of the corner-stone, which must have been of immense size, while in the south wall of House B, at the angle above B on the plan is a huge block of conglomerate, the only one which occurs in these buildings. We may thus conclude with certainty that this was at one time the S.E. corner of the house, and that the eastern room is a later addition. The bounding walls of the northernmost block, i.e., of the unexcavated portion of House F, are the nearest to being megalithic: they are built of large, roughly squared stones which are often as much as "40-'6o m. in width. The repeated set-back in the southern wall of Houses A and B is a well-known feature of Mycenaean architecture, and occurs again at Roussolakkos, though in a much less pronounced form. The best door-sills, e.g., those at the entrance and exit of the vestibule of House A, are of the same fine grey limestone of Cavo Sidhero which is used for this purpose at Roussolakkos. In general plan the buildings resemble the normal 'megalithic' homesteads of East Crete, but with a better covering of earth, especially in the centre, where the walls stand three or more courses high. Interior of the Buildings.-The southern block is divided into a northern and a southern section by a wall which runs right through the entire breadth of the building without a door. In the southern section we have two groups of rooms which do not communicate with each other. The western of these (House A) is entered by a vestibule provided with a fine door-sill: on the right of this is a room roughly square, in which was found a polygonal slab of stone (greatest diagonal, "36 m.) with a circular bowl-like depression in the centre: in the floor was embedded, apparently in situ, a stone mortar which had been worn through and so resembled a large funnel (diamr. at top, "42 m. outside, "25 inside; depth ca. "40). Beyond this is a second and larger room, with a niche or recass at its S.E. corner. On the left of the vestibule is a small room, seemingly doorless, in which a similar recess, formed by a short transverse wall, contained a</page><page sequence="59">332 DAWKINS AND TOD large earthenware jar. House B, the south-eastern corner of the block, consists of four rooms, the largest of which was, as we have seen, no part of the original plan, but a later addition. The house, which is entered from the east, is so built that in order to reach the fourth and innermost room one must pass through the other three. The northern section of this block of buildings (House C) is formed by a group of interconnected rooms, the most prominent of which is the large L-shaped megaroni which may be entered either from the N.W. corner by a door opening out from a small paved area or court, or from the S.E. corner by a narrower entrance. About the centre of the longer arm of the L are carefully worked stone jambs for two doors. These jambs, which are of the usual type found at Knossos and elsewhere, are still in situ. 'they are "74 m. in breadth, and the part between the pro- jections is "53 m. in breadth by I3 in height. There is in their arrange- ment a striking lack of symmetry, for while one side jamb abuts directly on the western wall of the megaron, the other is joined to that on the east by a short transverse wall. This irregularity suggests that we have here to deal with a reconstruction, and the idea is confirmed when we find in the room west of the megaron a pair of jambs flanking the entrance of a small closet or cupboard, which, though broken, correspond roughly with those of the megaron. Their present position seems somewhat unusual, and the conjecture suggests itself that they originally belonged to a third door in the same line with the other two at a time before the room with the closet had been cut off from the megaron. This conjecture is corroborated when we find that, supposing this third door to have been uniform with the other two in size, the western jamb would abut directly upon the western wall of the closet just referred to. We shall find in examining the northern block of buildings unmistakable signs of a reconstruction, which may have taken place contemporaneously with that of the megaron of House C. In the north wall of this are two pro- jections, forming what may have been a fireplace, while almost opposite them, in a niche or recess in the wall, was discovered a small hoard of bronze objects, consisting of- I. A needle, "197 m. long; of square section in the upper part, becoming gradually round towards the point; flattened at one end and pierced.</page><page sequence="60">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 333 2. A chisel (?) 26 m. long when found, "03 m. broad; pierced at the end. 3. A double axe, formed of two very thin laminae soldered or welded together and diverging in the centre so as to form a hole for a round haft; breadth across centre, "o6 m. Both edges have been broken away, but the original length of the axe must have been at least "24 m. 4. Similar double axe, composed of two thin plates overlapping at the centre, where they form a tube for the shaft. One edge is partly preserved, and shows that the original length was "25 m., breadth "o5. 5. Broad flat celt, "I8 m. long, with one rivet-hole, like one from Kythnos in the British Museum (Ridgeway, Early Age of Greece, I, Fig. 24A); breadth at butt "05, at edge "o8. 6. A thin lamina ornamented with bosses in repouss' work; in shape like the side of a pair of bellows, with two projecting ears; height 'I24 in., breadth "o8. 7. Upper part of a knife with two rivet-holes, breadth "o24 m., length "o6. Close by was found a bronze chisel "34 m. in length, the largest bronze implement as yet found at Palaikastro. A number of fragments of plaster show that the walls of the megaron were ornamented with a fresco decoration in red, blue, and white: the interior of the niche in which the bronzes were found seems also to have had a coat of plaster. Signs of plaster were also forthcoming in the room on the S.W. of the megaron and the small closet opening off it: perhaps this dated from a period anterior to the rebuilding, when, as we have seen, these two rooms not improbably formed part of the megaron. The north-western portion of this house is formed by a large room which may have been an open court, from which there is a back door into the house itself: its most striking feature is the extra- ordinarily thick wall which bounds it on the west, and of which no satis- factory explanation has suggested itself. The northern group of buildings consists, so far as excavated, of three houses. Of these the eastern one (House E) has two doors on the east, and possibly one or two on the north: of the interior only the inner face of the western wall was traced, and the position of a single transverse</page><page sequence="61">334 DAWKINS AND TOD wall determined. The northern building (House F), which was partially cleared, is entered, like House A, by a vestibule, the massive door-sill of which originally called attention to this spot. To the left of this is a small room containing a recess in its south-eastern corner, in which was found the late Mycenaean vase described on p. 320. Beyond this, but not accessible from it, was a second room, in which was found still in situ a large piece of floor cement. From this room came also a flattish, oval stone ('Io m. high, "o6 broad) with a notch in the middle of each of the longer sides; its similarity to some of the Trojan idols (H. Schmidt, Schliemaun's Sammiung troj. Altertiimer, No. 7409) is very striking. To the right of the vestibule lie two further rooms, and a door from the more westerly of these, which is adjoined by a small chamber, leads into the unexcavated portion of the house. The building marked D on the plan, which forms the central part of the whole system, is strikingly different from the rest. It seems to be almost entirely open on the south side, and has also two doors, one on the west, the other, provided with a large sill built of irregular stones, on the north: the narrow opening close to the N.W. corner is seemingly intended for a rubbish-shoot or some similar purpose. In the N.W. room were found fragments of white plaster, probably fallen from the walls, while in the S.W. corner were the remains of a slab pavement. The north-eastern portion of D was occupied by a raised platform on which rested a stone roughly circular (diamr. "42 m.), which was surrounded by lower stones forming a sort of runnel round it. This, and the presence of a trough immediately west of it, made it seem probable that the apparatus was the bed of a primitive form of olive-press. In any case its construction dates from a period subsequent to that at which the house was first built, for the removal of the round stone and the pavement revealed beneath them four very large ashlar blocks bedded in plaster, filling up the space between the two walls and also running into the N. wall. The removal of these hewn blocks showed the plan as it stands drawn, where, however, the round stone is shown as it was found standing on the pavement. The use of fine ashlar blocks for mere packing shows that they come from some previously demolished structure, and must be brought into connection with the reconstruction which we have already noticed as having taken place in House C. D is separated from F by a blind alley, closed on the east by the</page><page sequence="62">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 335 western wall of House E. At the end of this alley was found a large coarse jar, seemingly in situ, blackened by fire inside and having an original hole in the base. Close by were a bronze double axe (length "15 m., breadth "057), three stone rubbers, two hones, sixteen 'loom- weights' of various forms, a pierced stone, two circular pebbles similar to that illustrated in Evans, Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain, Fig. 165, and a large number of fragments of clay and stone vessels. Pottery, and other Small Finds.-Of Kamires ware only one frag- ment was found, the spout of a beaked jug: painted Mycenaean pottery was also rare, the only vase which it was possible to restore being the bowl referred to above. This bowl in conjunction with the top of a big, coarse Buigelkanne serves to show that the Kouraminos settlement was contemporaneous with the later Mycenaean occupation of the Roussolakkos site, while the rarity of painted fragments points to the poorer character of the place. The mass of the pottery was of the common domestic kind (pithoi, strainers, cooking pots, Biigelkannen, &amp;c., mostly broken) which occurred in such abundance in the floor-deposits of Roussolakkos. It may therefore be concluded that the desertion of the Kouraminos site occurred at the same time as that of the main town. Besides the finds which have been referred to above, we may here mention four obsidian chips; a number of fragments of steatite vessels, including one of a good blossom-bowl; part of a lamp of the usual Mycenaean stone type much calcined, and a circular lid; four hones; several rubbers ; two saddle-querns; a fragment of a large limestone jar; two stone slabs with circular bowl-like depressions in the centre, one square, the other an irregular polygon ; two shells, a triton and a cowrie; and a bronze pin. R. M. DAWKINS. MARCUS NIEBUHR TOD.</page><page sequence="63">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. , Io.-HAGIOS NIKOLAOS. ON March 31st, 1903, and the three following days I conducted a trial excavation at a site situated at about an hour's distance from Rous- solakkos, and known as Hagios Nikolaos from a small church of that name. During the first three days I employed ten men, on the fourth only two. The most prominent feature of the landscape is the height called M6dhi (1776 ft.). From the foot of this there runs almost due east a deep valley with a river-bed, which, although quite dry at the time when I saw it, must sometimes carry off a considerable volume of water from the surrounding hills. The valley is at first narrow and its sides very steep, but a little way above the chapel it broadens out considerably: although the left bank is steep and in places almost precipitous, the right side rises in a gentle slope, forming a series of terraces which are under cultivation and afford a good harvest in spite of the stony character of the soil. It is on this southern slope that the chapel stands, situated on a small outcrop of rock and surrounded by cornfields. These, how- ever, lie chiefly to the north and west: on the south the ground rises more and more sharply, the cultivated fields giving place in some fifty yards to a steep slope covered thickly with bushes and undergrowth and terminating in a line of low cliffs known locally as o-vv drypto pFtXora TO cppoD3t, 'the Wild Bee Crag.' Above these, again, the ground rises very rapidly to form the northern portion of the great upland plateau of Magas~i and Karydhi. On the east the gentle slope of the valley extends for about a hundred yards beyond the chapel, where it is intersected by a</page><page sequence="64">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 337 deep, though narrow, torrent-bed running down from the low cliffs just referred to and joining the main watercourse. Beyond this the soil is waste and uncultivated as far as a second and larger stream-bed, which breaks through from the upper plateau by a wild and precipitous gorge, and which also runs down to the main river-bed, its lofty eastern bank forming the remarkable natural bridge or ramp over which runs the road connecting Palaikastro with the plateau and with the Karodimes valley. This ramp is continued northwards by a low line of hills which closes on the east the Hagios Nikolaos valley, and forces the river to take a sudden bend in a northerly direction, which it follows until, emerging on the open plain of Palaikastro, it turns once more east and flows through the plain to the sea. The site had been previously visited by Professor Halbherr, who found built into the ,yesa 1'parefa of the chapel a fragment of an inscription recording a treaty between Knossos and Hierapytna,' as also by Mr. Evans, who directed our attention to the possible significance of this piece of evidence. Shortly after our arrival at Palaikastro, Mr. Bosanquet and I revisited the site together. We found the inscription somewhat disguised under a liberal coating of whitewash which had been recently applied to it in common with the whole interior of the chapel. The same whitewash also partially concealed the material, though not the form, of a fine Mycenaean 'table of offering' 2 of black steatite, which was used as a 9vyttar2ptov: we subsequently obtained permission to remove it, and it is now in the Candia Museum. This 'table of offering' was similar in form to the usual type of steatite lamp found on most Mycenaean sites, with a circular stalk or stem below and a round bowl in its upper surface; this bowl, however, was complete, and was not furnished with lips such as lamps of this type have for their wicks. It had been found at Rousso- lakkos, and brought from there to Hagios Nikolaos. The presence of the inscription was harder to account for, though it may have been brought by sea from Knossos or Hierapytna as ballast and left on the beach at Palai- kastro. There is, however, a local tradition to the effect that it was found on the spot, and as the place would accord well with the data supplied by 1 Published in Auluseo Italiano di Antickitd Classica III (1890), p. 612, Collitz-Bechtel, Sammlung, 5073. 2 Its dimensions are-height "18 m., length and breadth "35 m., interior diameter of bowl *I8 m., rim of bowl "02 cms.</page><page sequence="65">338 MARCUS NIEBUHR TOD the Toplu inscription 1 for the site of the temple of Dictaean Zeus, the principal sanctuary of the Eteocretan territory, we decided to test the ground by digging trial trenches in the most likely-looking spots. Remainzs of Early Houses.-No traces at all of ashlar masonry were found, nor any architectural members either in marble or in local stone. I was told, indeed, that a 'squared block of marble' had been discovered at a spot some little way N.W. of the church, and had been carried off to the village of Palaio Mitato: I did not, however, see the stone in question, and trial pits at the place indicated showed no traces at all of any building. On the other hand, indications were not wanting that the valley had been the scene of an early settlement. On the N. bank of the stream, about ten minutes' walk from the chapel, stands a group of two or three houses with the remains close by of a massive megalithic wall, which unfortunately has been made to contribute largely to the building of a modern house and byre. Further up the valley, in a commanding position on the crest of a low hill, I discovered the foundations of a small house of unhewn stones: the sherds found in and around it were not, however, sufficient to determine its date. Close by the chapel the evidence was more definite. About 150 yards N.W. of it a small two-roomed house 2 of unhewn stones was found, which is dated by the objects in it to the Mycenaean period. In the room to the E. were many large fragments of two or more pithol of the ordinary Mycenaean type, a number of fragments of steatite, of which the largest was perforated, a small circular lid of steatite (diameter 0o83 m.), a " saddle-quern," and several bits of a thick white floor-plaster. The western room contained a small hoard of stone rubbers, thirteen in number, found together close to the south wall: two of these must have been in long use to judge by the extraordinary polish of their surfaces, while three appeared to have been very little used. Along with these was found a hone "I45 m. long, "o48 m. broad, and 'o35 m. high. This room also yielded a large pithos-cover with handle, three ' saddle-querns,' two fragments of a broad clay runnel (?), and a flat stone with two smooth surfaces, very roughly circular, "I9 m. in length and breadth. 1 Pashley, Travels in Crete, I 290; Spratt, Travels and Researckes in Crete, II 430 foil.; Halbherr, Museo Italiano, III (I89o) 570; Kern, Inschriften von Magnesia ad Maiandrum, No. 105; Dittenberger, Sylloge2, II No. 929; Holleaux, Hermes xxxix.

II. 339 Immediately outside the house to the north was found a small cup of the common Mycenaean type, of very rude make (diameter at mouth 'o7-'o8 m., at foot "04 m.), along with fragments of other cups, and a fine black stone rubber with two highly polished surfaces. A second runnel with two parallel 'ribs' crossing the flat bottom and a small yellow plaque with incised lines appeared to me to belong to a much later date than the rest of the pottery found in this house, and the inference that it was inhabited right on into Hellenic times was confirmed by the discovery of a bronze coin, which, though in a bad state of preservation, I believe to be certainly Hellenic. The most striking point about this house was its extreme smallness, the two rooms measuring 2'o3 x I"3 m. and 2"4 x 2"1 m. respectively. These dimensions would seem to point to the conclusion that the building was of the nature of a store or outhouse rather than a dwelling. A short distance to the S.E. the foundations of another building were cleared: this also consisted of two rooms, divided by a partition wall about "5 m. thick. The interior of the house measured 5"5 by 5"8 m., and produced one green stone rubber and a large number of sherds: among these there was nothing distinctly Mycenaean, while a number of them looked rather Hellenistic or Roman. Another house was located S.W. of the chapel, but as it yielded only a few sherds, and those of uncertain period, I did not entirely clear it. The Cave Burials.-The cliffs above the chapel,.to which reference has already been made, contain a number of small caverns and rock- shelters: of these I examined three, which were pointed out to me by inhabitants of the valley as containing 'human heads.' I. At the foot of the cliff, above and slightly eastwards of the chapel, is a shallow cavern, with a low wall at its entrance. It proved to contain a number of human skeletons, whose skulls, seven or eight in number, were particularly well preserved: several of these were afterwards examined by Mr. Duckworth. Along with these were the bones of various animals which had probably made the cavern their lair: these included bones of badger, hare, sheep (?), and partridge. No metal objects were found, and of pottery only two small fragments. II. In a second rock-shelter, some little way to the W. of the chapel, two or three persons seem to have been buried. The bones were in a fair Z2</page><page sequence="67">340 MARCUS NIEBUHR TOD state of preservation, but I only found fragments of one skull. No pottery came to light, but a bronze buckle and button were discovered pointing to a late date for the interment, which was probably medieval. III. The third rock-shelter I examined was situated half way up the cliff, above a steep slope called 'the charcoal hollow' (capfovvoXdIcov); it lies a little to the E. of the chapel, and immediately above the stream-bed referred to above (p. 336) as bounding the cultivated area. It is not very easy of access, and I was guided to it by Stavros Kandikakis, one of my workmen, who remembered having seen bones there while a shepherd boy forty years ago. Before the rock lies a narrow ledge or platform some eight metres in length, fronted by a low wall at a distance of two metres from the face of the rock. On this ledge I found the remains of a clay pithos, with an ornament consisting of a single band of 'ropework': it was lying on its side, and more than half of it had been broken off and had disappeared. The part which remained was full of human bones, while on one fragment was a double-axe, which had been deeply, though rudely, incised while the clay was still soft. Mr. Bosanquet subsequently examined these fragments and found that the pithos was contemporary with the chief settlement at Palaikastro. Besides the general similarity of the ware, he noticed three specific points of agreement: (I) the relief band on the shoulder ornamented with finger impressions, (2) the way in which the handles tended to detach themselves, owing to their having been merely impressed while the clay was soft on the surface of the jar, which was scratched in order to afford them a better hold, and (3) the flange or band running round the pitios at its base. No traces of later interments were here visible, but at a slightly lower level I found evidence that the rock-shelter had been used as a place of burial at a very early period. There was a large accumulation of skulls and other bones, all of them human with the exception of the jaw of a pole-cat and the tooth of an ox. These bones were examined by Mr. Duckworth, who accompanied me to Hagios Nikolaos on April 3rd with that object. Along with the bones, placed close by the skulls, were found some very early vases, which must be attributed to the very beginning of the Bronze Age. These vases, which are with one exception of a coarse grey clay, are all hand-made: they are without bases and are so imper- fectly flattened at the bottom that they do not stand at all firmly. Two small fragments were found with a pattern of cross-hatched lines finely</page><page sequence="68">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 341 incised on the polished clay, but all the other fragments as well as the whole vases are devoid of any incised or painted decoration. EIG. I.-VASES FROM ROCK-SHELTER. The whole vases are ten in number, and fall into four classes :- A. Vases with oblate spherical bodies tending to angularity at the line of greatest circumference: above this body is a short cylindrical neck, on which fits a corresponding cap, which would act as a cover and also, perhaps, as a cup. Both vases and caps are provided with vertical suspension holes, enabling lid and vase to be tied together: the 'lugs' through which these holes are pierced are either single flattened bosses projecting from the body of the vase or the top of the cap, or they consist of pairs of-short circular stumps. Of this class five examples were found- i. Vase with double handles and cap (Fig. 2 a, b). be FIG. 2.-TYPES OF VASES FRO[M ROCK-SHIELTER. B. 5. 2. Vase with single handles and cap.

The cap, however, is too large for the neck, and there is some doubt whether it belongs to this vase.</page><page sequence="69">342 MARCUS NIEBUHR TOD 4. Vase with single handles, without cap. Here the angularity above referred to is very marked, forming a sharply defined, though irregular, line round the body. This has the smoothest surface of all the vases, a surface which in some places is blackened by smoke (Fig. 2 c). 5. A similar vase with the neck broken off. Among the fragments were three broken bowls, probably remains of vases of this type, and also the neck of such a vase. B. A vase of finer clay, thinner ware, and more delicate form. The transition between body and neck is more gradual, and the top of the neck ends in a lip in which are pierced four small horizontal holes (Fig. 2 d). C. A cup-like vessel of yellowish-brown clay, narrower at the top than at the foot. The handles, which are pierced with suspension-holes, are not set on horizontally, but rise from the body: originally it had a spout, but this has been broken off. This vessel is of coarser make than the rest, and the bottom is so rounded that it will not stand straight (Fig. 2 e). A second example of this type was also found. D. Two basins; the 'lugs,' pierced with suspension-holes, are situated close under the rim of the bowl. The relations between these vases and those found at Palaikastro have been discussed on p. 299 of the present volume by Mr. Dawkins, to whom I wish to express my warm thanks for the help he has given me in writing the foregoing description and catalogue, and for making the draw- ings which have been reproduced in the accompanying figure. In form and technique there is a certain resemblance between the vases of class A and some which were discovered in prehistoric graves on Paros and Despotikon by M. Tsountas ('E~bp. 'ApXatoX. 1898, P1. IX. Nos. 1-5), and at Pelos on Melos by Mr. Edgar (B.S.A. III. 35 foll.), though the bodies of the Cretan vases are more squat, the necks more nearly cylindrical, and the union of neck and body in consequence more clearly marked. Points of comparison may also be found with the vases from the prehistoric grotto of Miamci excavated by M. Taramelli (Am. Journ. Arch. 1897, 287 foll.). But the closest parallels I can find are with the pottery from the earlier period of the second town at Troy, described by H. Schmidt in Dsrpfeld, Troja und Ilion (Athens, 1902), I. 252-280, and in the catalogue of Sc/liemann's Sammlung trojanischer Altertiimer published by the Berlin Museum (Berlin, 1902): many of these are also illustrated and described in Schliemann, Ilios (London, 1880), 356-369. The Cretan vases, however, are more primitive in appearance: the majority of those from Troy have the top of the neck turned outwards so as to form a slight lip, while most</page><page sequence="70">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II, 343 have also a base or three short legs. The 'lug' approaches very nearly that figured in Schmidt's Catalogue, No. 556, p. 28, as also one from the first city at Troy (Troja u. Ilion, I. p. 247, Fig. 1o2), while the closest parallel to the Cretan caps is also from the lowest Trojan stratum (op. cit. I. p. 249, Figs. I Io, II I) : the two caps there illustrated, however, have four 'lugs,' all of which are in the first instance pierced with suspension holes, while in the second only two are so pierced, the other two remaining as ornamental projections. Somewhat similar caps of silver were also found at Troy covering thin-necked silver jars (op. cit. I. 350-I, Figs. 276, 277). The holes pierced directly under the lip of the vase of class B were for the attachment of a flat lid; similar lids with two or four string-holes occur at Troy in considerable numbers: see Schmidt's Catalogue, Nos. 485-494, 759-804. Besides pottery the only small objects found were (I) a small leaden or silver bead, pierced, cylindrical in shape but pinched in the middle, and (2) a fragment of an article in bone, '053 m. in length, resembling in form the end of a pocket paper-knife. At the left-hand side of the ledge a small cavern in the rock, sufficient to shelter half a dozen sheep or goats, has evidently been much used by shepherds, by whose fires it has been blackened, and by their flocks, which have rubbed the rock quite smooth in places. If there were ever any human remains here, as I believe to be more than likely, they have long since been cleared out. Below the earth which was in this cavern three levels were distinctly traceable. There was first a thin layer of small stones, seemingly water-worn; immediately below this was a stratum of char- coal, in which were found an obsidian chip and a considerable number of sherds similar in character to the vases described above, though of a more reddish tinge; and beneath this was the floor level of a hard clayey earth, 'like that which we put on the roofs of our houses nowadays,' as one of the workmen explained. MARCUS NIEBUHR TOD.</page><page sequence="71">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 1I I.-HUMAN REMAINS AT HAGIOS NIKOLAOS. ABOUT a week after my arrival at Palaikastro, Mr. Tod having made preliminary investigations resulting in the discovery of human crania associated with pottery of a very early period at Hagios Nikolaos, it was suggested that I should visit the locality. The present report contains an account of the results of my examination made in accordance with that suggestion. The date was April 3rd, 1903, and some final notes were added on April 8th, 1903. The simple building dignified by the title of Hagios Nikolaos is placed about five miles inland from the shore of Grandes Bay, hidden in a perfect labyrinth of intersecting valleys and ravines. The particular glen, on the southern slope of which the church is situated, runs, generally speaking, east and west, but turns at either extremity eastwards, running first to the south and then sharply resuming an eastward direction; while the west- ern end, the head of the valley, trends slightly to the north. A steep ascent across a couple of fields above the church brings one to the foot of the rocks forming the southern boundary of the valley, where the familiar local structure of an easily-weathered limestone is met with at once. Thence one must scramble up among great masses of lentisk and carob, with numerous thyme and sage bushes, in the interstices of fallen boulders, till, at about sixty feet above the foot of the scarp, one arrives at a cleft which gives access (cf. Fig. I.A), to the ' cave' dis- covered by Mr. Tod. Rock-shelter is a more appropriate expression than cave, for it is a mere shelf of rock, receding at most to some five or six feet from the face of the cliff, by the overhanging of which, this</page><page sequence="72">'Ae~-2. / 3.

DUCKWORTH ' abri sous roche' is sheltered. Probably the shelter has been the resort of shepherds from time immemorial, and a particular attraction is furnished by the absence of water dripping from the upper parts of the rock, the cause of abundant mossy growths in similar shelters in the same line of cliffs. From the platform one looks down on the little church, and beyond it at the corresponding cliff-wall of the northern side of the glen. The latter wall is formed by a brilliantly-coloured mass of conglomerate, a medley of FIG. 2.-VIEW OF INTERIOR AND FLOOR OF THE ROCK-SHELTER AT HAGIOS NIKOTAOS, LOOKING SOUTH-EAST. Access to the shelter is obtained on the left-hand side (ci. Fig. I). reds and yellows in regular stratification. Beyond this again, a vista of low flattened ridges with an occasional peak, to which finally the eastern sea succeeds, and, beyond the nearer island cf Elasa, one can even make out Karpathos and Kasos on the horizon. Such is the situation and such the outlook from the site to be investi- gated. The dimensions of the platform may be gathered from the accom- panying plan drawn approximately to scale. Though described as a</page><page sequence="74">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 347 platform or plateau, the floor was in reality most uneven, and, as a result of the excavations of Mr. Tod's party, only that part to the right (west) of the diagram remained at all level, the remaining parts having been so dis- turbed as to leave two shallow pits. In the stage represented in the diagram, however, further excavations had been carried out on the part at first un- touched, till this level was brought down as low as or lower than in these other regions. But on my arrival the whole floor was encumbered with ddbris from the superficial digging. Bones were numerous, some in fragments, a few complete and intact. Among the fragments were several referable to the skull, and remains of about six skulls were thus seen. Four skulls were speedily brought to light on the resumption of operations, and eventu- ally others more or less fragmentary, bringing the total up to ten. They occurred in or about the middle region of the shelter (cf. Fig. 2), not in the very deep pocket at its eastern end, or near the western end. Moreover it was estimated that Nos. 4, 5, 8, 9 (shewn in the plan) must have been less than six inches below the original level broken up by Mr. Tod's party. This was shewn by their positions in relation to the area on the large stone marked in the plan (q.v. B.), the worn and polished surface of which indi- cates its long exposure. A few bones of small mammals including the skull of a badger (an animal still locally abundant) occurred, but there was a striking absence of any accumulation of such remains or of the remains of domestic animals or birds, such as would suggest that the shelter had served as a habitation or dwelling-place. Charcoal fragments occurred, but these were recent. The notes made upon the several specimens of skulls are given in the sequel; and it is now appropriate to make such general remarks as can be passed on the characters of the individuals whose remains were thus found, and on the circumstances of their interment. In the first place, the remains are in my opinion those of individuals who agree in all essentials with that population of this part of Crete which is represented in the ossuaries at Roussolakkos and Patema (Palaikastro). The skull-form and characters are the same (cf. Fig. 3); long narrow skulls with full occiput, with long narrow faces. The limb-bones denote the same physical development and stature, feeble, as we consider it, in com- parison with the stouter and sturdier modern inhabitants. The crania differ from the four specimens collected by Mr. Tod, which appear to me to be of later date. The earlier specimens are just</page><page sequence="75">348 W. L. H. DUCKWORTH as fragile as those at Palaikastro, and measurements had to be made as far as possible while they remained in situ. The child's skull (No. 5) presents an example of precocious union of the two parietal bones, but this is an abnormality which may occur in any human race, and its significance is quite unknown. Probably it has no effect in modifying the intellect. A femur bears a remarkable exostosis in its upper portion; this pathological condition may be due to one of a variety of causes such as (I) spinal disease, (2) aneurysm of the femoral artery, (3) a punctured wound, (4) the disease known as myositis ossificans, (5) osteo-arthritis or FIG. 3.-TWO OF THE ANCIENT CRANIA EXHUMED AT HAGIOS NIKOLAOS. 'rheumatics,' (6) bone-hypertrophy following fracture. In the absence of more definite evidence, I am inclined to rule out (I) (2) (4) (6) and to favour (3) or (5), but in any circumstances no particular inferences as to the ethnic relations of the individual can be drawn from the occurrence. Similar exostoses were seen in two other cases, at Roussolakkos and Patema respectively. Finally, I incline to the belief that the skeletons were transported to this shelter and here deposited as in the ossuaries at Roussolakkos. The absolute confusion of the remains indicates this, and it is well-nigh in- credible that this small shelter could have been the habitual residence of the comparatively large number (at least a dozen) of persons whose remains</page><page sequence="76">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 349 have been found. That pottery should be found is not surprising in view of the number of sherds and cups found in corresponding circumstances at Roussolakkos. The net result then of my investigation is to indicate that the inhab- itants of Crete who used the earthen vessels found at Hagios Nikolaos belonged to the same stock as those whose remains are found at Rousso- lakkos and at Patema, and that they are, like them, referable to the so- called Mediterranean race. The notes on the crania and long bones are here appended. Brief Notes on the Crania found at Hagios Nikolaos. No. I. Fragments of the synostosed parietal bones of what was probably a mesati- cephalic skull. The individual was probably about 50 years of age (ref. D. I5o). No. II. (D. I5I). An adult dolicho-cephalic male skull; it contained cave-earth, small helices, and three phalanges, clear evidence of the artificial circum- stances of its interment here. No. III. (D. 152). A calvaria with the base, but no face or mandible. An ovoid dolicho-cephalic female skull: the occipital renflement is distinct: the brow- ridges insignificant. In all respects very similar to the prevailing skull-form at Roussolakkos and Patema. The left orbit contained a cuneiform bone of the foot, wedged firmly in. No. IV. (D 153). Portions of the synostosed parietal bones of an adult skull, of dolicho-cephalic proportions. No. V. (D. 154). Fragments of the cranium of a child of about 6 years of age; remarkable for premature synostosis of the parietal bones. It is broader than the other crania, being just brachy-cephalic in proportions. No. VI. (D. I55). Frontal and parts of the parietal bones of an adult male skull of seemingly dolicho-cephalic proportions : sagittal synostosis complete; the individual was about 50 years old. The brow-ridges are not massive. No. VII. (D. 156). Parts of the squama occipitis of the parietal and frontal bones of what was probably an adult female skull of mesati-cephalic proportions. No. VIIa. Fragment of a thick occipital bone. No. VIII. (D. 157). Large oval dolicho-cephalic cranium, without the face, of an adult male : sagittal synostosis nearly complete: brow-ridges moderately developed: the transverse occipital crest is not marked. No. IX. (D. I58). Large oval dolicho-cephalic male skull. The sagittal suture is completely synostosed. The brow-ridges are moderately developed. The occipital crest and mastoid processes are massive. Nasal and orbital apertures are small. No. X. (D. '59). Mesati-cephalic skull which at once crumbled into fragments. Sex and age doubtful.</page><page sequence="77">350 W. L. H. DUCKWORTH No. Xa. Fragments of a large skull with marked occipital renflement: the frag- ments are too few and small to yield measurements. The following cephalic indices are provided by the foregoing specimens.

The following averages result from measurements of the long bones of the limbs of adults: despite the great number of bones, very few were perfect enough to provide data.

As might be inferred from the small linear dimensions of these limb- bones, the estimated stature of the individuals was very slight; if we suppose that the bones which could be appropriately measured all belonged to female skeletons, the probable average stature of the latter was about 1520 mm., which, however, is not very different from the average stature of eight modern Cretan women of Palaikastro, viz., 1546 mm.: on the sup- position that the bones are male, the probable stature was on the average about 1560 mm., which falls far short of the average stature of even the prehistoric male inhabitants of Palaikastro (1625 mm.), much more so of the modern male inhabitants of that locality (1677 mm.). The prob- ability is therefore that these bones are female, and are to be associated with one or other of the feminine crania above described. 1 I2.-OSSUARIES AT ROUSSOLAKKOS. The following account is practically identical with section (a) of my Report to the Cretan Committee of the British Association (cf. Reports, Section H, 1903, Southport meeting). On the 26th March, 1903, the day of my arrival at Palaikastro, I commenced work on the ossuary dis- covered and partially excavated in the preceding year (cf. Report by</page><page sequence="78">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 35I R. C. Bosanquet, in Man, 1902). The work consisted in exposing the crania in the several compartments of that enclosure, and I soon found that the only reliable method of obtaining satisfactory cranial measure- ments was to clear away the surrounding earth from each skull and to measure while the specimen was still in situ. Subsequently, each skull (to the number of about thirty) was carefully removed, and then, moistened paper having been spread over and around it, a covering of plaster of Paris was finally applied : in this way it was hoped to render the skulls less liable to destruction in the transit to Candia or to such other destination as might be determined upon. Lastly, several skulls were further strengthened by receiving an internal lining of plaster of Paris after so much of their earthy contents had been removed as was practicable. With regard to the other parts of the skeleton, the long bones were in some cases also measured as they lay exposed, this precaution being necessitated by their extreme fragility, especially as regards the articular ends. But even so, compara- tively few were suitable for measurements of length, for the ends were very frequently already destroyed. Measurements of the cross-section of the shaft of such bones were, however, made in a very great number of instances in which no reliable measurement of the length was obtainable. Incidentally, various objects such as earthen vessels, occasional fragments of bronze or copper, and occasionally bone-fragments from skeletons of domestic animals, were found intermingled with the human remains, and the former (i.e. all specimens other than animal remains) were handed over to the Director. Four days' work enabled me to complete the examination of this first ossuary(No. I on Plan, Fig. 4), after which attention was transferred to the site known as Patema, situated about 6o0 yards to the south of the knoll first examined. At Patema many human remains were found associated with numerous sherds and earthen vessels, and while the state of preservation of the former closely resembled that of the Roussolakkos bones, it is note- worthy that the comparatively regular arrangement within an enclosure was absent. I have no doubt, however, that the remains are approximately contemporaneous in date. My superintendence of the work at Patema was interrupted to admit of examining the rock-shelter at Hagios Nikolaos as described in my former note, but the Director kindly replaced me (this was on the 3rd of April), so that the work was uninterrupted till April 5th, when the Easter holidays</page><page sequence="79">352 W. L. H. DUCKWORTH caused a break until April 9th. On this date excavations were resumed at Patema, but as they proved almost entirely fruitless, it was decided to make some further researches nearer the first ossuary. After several trial pits had been sunk, without success, a second ossuary was found (No. 2 on Fig. 4) about fifty feet from the first, and the next two -N: I ~ ~o~~sala~k Q3. ~V~~yA~O2.

As in ossuary No. I, here also walls and suggestions of compartments were met with, but the arrangement is far from being as regular as in the first ossuary. It is to be noticed that both ossuaries are situated on the highest parts of a low knoll or hillock, and no doubt much denudation of this has occurred since the walls were</page><page sequence="80">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 353 built and the skeletons placed here. A large flat stone described in the plan as a 'flagstone' was found in Ossuary No. 2, but could be associated with no special human remains. From the two ossuaries and the site at Patema, about fifty-eight male and twenty female crania have now been obtained in a condition suitable for yielding the important data of the proportions of length and breadth. (The crania in the Candia Museum and those measured by Dr. C. S Myers are here included.) They shew indisputably that the head-form of these early Cretans was distinctly dolicho-cephalic; herein the skulls agree with other Cretan crania of early date, and with the majority of early Greek (mainland) and 'Aegean' specimens. But an important point upon which information has been desired by many who are interested in the prehistoric ethnology of the Aegean area in general, and of Crete in particular, is the inquiry as to the predominance or the contrary of one cranial form. The acquisition of such a large number of crania of early date affords a means of answering the question more definitely than was previously possible. Previously, it was known that short or broad skulls do occur, as at Antiparos; but the instances were admittedly not numerous. The crania of early date, which are forthcoming for examination, pro- vide material for the statement that, in this particular population, not only is a long-headed type shewn by the average figures, but this type is also dominant; for in percentages the dolicho-cephalic crania provide 65"3, while 8"55 per cent. only are definitely short or broad, 26"I5 per cent. being of mean proportions. The foregoing data refer to male crania, whereas among the female crania the long-headed type is even more definitely predominant with a percentage of 7o'6 (5"87 per cent. of short skulls and 23"53 per cent. of mean proportions). Nevertheless a percentage of from 5"87 to 8"55 of broad skulls must be recognised. The crania derived from Palaikastro and Hagios Nikolaos are almost certainly of earlier date than those discovered at Zakro and described by Boyd Dawkins, and those from Erganos described by Sergi. And the fact of the association of long with short crania is more valuable than the fact of short crania being found in one locality, and long crania in a second perhaps far removed from the first. The long bones afford a means of estimating the stature of these early inhabitants of eastern Crete: this would seem to have been about AA</page><page sequence="81">354 W.L. H. DUCKWORTH 1625 mm., which, judged by the English standard, is a small figure (below 5ft. 5in.). It seems that the early Cretans anticipated in head-form FIG. 5.-SKELETON FOUND AT PATEMA.

II. 355 Reference must finally be made to the very important discovery (at Patema) of a skeleton (the skull was not present) lying in the 'contracted' position, and on the left side. The long axis'of the corpse had been placed approximately N.E. and S.W., the head having pointed to the east (cf. Figs. 5 and 6). The remainder of my work in Crete consisted of an investigation of the characters of the modern inhabitants including children and adults. It may here be summarised by stating that the modern inhabitants of Sitia province in eastern Crete do not by any means reproduce the characters of head-form or stature of the early population, for instead of having long heads, they are brachy-cephalic, and in stature average (adult males) I677 mm. as against 1625 mm.

THE plain and bay of Palaikastro are bounded on the south by an abrupt ridge of hills, which run out seaward into a prominent cape. Landwards, this ridge is cut off from the mass which culminates in Mt. Sim6dhi by a northward and a southward valley, which carry an almost impassable track from the Palaikastro plain to the cove of Karofimes. The highest peak of this ridge, which bears the name of Petsoft, stands directly south of Roussolakkos, and rises steeply above it to a height of 270 metres. Southwards beyond the summit the slope is at first more gentle, but becomes abrupt about a quarter of a mile further on, and drops rapidly to sea-level on the south side of the promontory. The actual summit is formed by a ragged crest of limestone, precipitous on the north side, and descending less rapidly southwards into the general slope already mentioned. Some 10-15 m. down this face, however, the natural slope of the ground is interrupted by a zig-zag terrace-wall, ABCDE, which still stands some 2"5 m. high at its external angle C, and holds up an artificial platform of made-earth within it. The little enclosure which lies against its outer face between C and D is wholly modern, though built almost wholly of ancient stones from the walls above: the older workmen described it as a 'look-out,' but it seemed also to have served as a sheep-pen. 1 Dr. L.

II. 357 Inside the terrace-wall, there were visible, before excavation, traces of (I) a cross wall DF, running obliquely to N.N.E. and abutting on a low natural crag of the ridge; (2) other cross-walls eastward and northward from B, and (3) a continuation of the terrace-wall northwards from A towards the precipitous edge of the site. The line along which the natural rock emerged from the accumulated earth of the terrace ran approximately from B to F; but east of the wall DF the deposit became rapidly shallower, and dwindled to a mere earth-filled trough in the natural rock about 3 m. distant at H. It was in this detached pocket of the terrace-accumulation that the knife of a small shepherd girl had turned up recently, close below the turf, the little series of clay figures of animals, which first called attention to Petsoft. Under these circumstances, the plan of attack was obvious.1 While three or four men started at H and worked westward through the deepen- ing deposit towards the face of the wall DF, others struck down along the back of this wall and along the rock line westwards from F. The space DFH was soon exhausted. Clay figures, of most of the types to be described hereafter, appeared at all depths, and at 30 cm. or more back from the face of the wall there was an ill-defined patch of a darker colour. But it soon became clear that the wall DF was of later construction, and had been carried down to the rock through the terrace- earth in such a way as to disturb any stratification which might have existed originally ; and the same result was obtained in the first stages of the works behind the west face of this wall. When, however, the working face of the trench had advanced a metre or so north-westward, and away from the wall DF, three distinct layers became clear, and were found to extend over the remainder of the site. (a) The surface earth was the ordinary brown loam of the limestone region, with many small stones and shattered pottery and figurines. Its depth ranged from 40 to 60 cm., the variation being explained by the slight southward slope of the surface. (b) Below this came a layer 17-20 cm. thick, and almost horizontal, of nearly black earth-slate-grey when dry-full of ashes and fragments of SI take this opportunity of thanking the Director of the British School for the unex- pected chance of examining the site; the ready help of Messrs. Tod and Dawkins in all points connected with the excavation; and the further elucidation by Messrs.

L. MYRES charcoal, and crowded with figurines. The latter were evidently undis- turbed since the deposit was completed: for a large proportion were whole, and many of them still retained their surface-colouring. This black layer had, in fact, every appearance of having originated in a large bonfire, into which the figurines had been thrown. The broken condition of many of the smaller figures might, of course, be due to accident and the heat of the fire; but the total absence of any bodies belonging to the feet, horns and other extremities of larger figures (p. 376 below) can only be explained by supposing that from time to time the bonfire became clogged with such larger figures, and was raked over and roughly purged of them ; the smaller objects and the fragments of the larger figures being left among the ashes, and the whole layer levelled for the reception of fresh fuel and figurines. Close parallels are offered by the condition of the Zeus altar at Olympia, and of the burnt layer in the Principal Sanctuary at Idalion; 1 and by the size and form of such fire-rakes as those from Tamassos, which, though of later date (vii-vi cent. apparently), seem to have been used for this same purpose.2 (c) Below the black layer came a thick bed of clayey earth of a strongly reddish colour, brightest at the top, and merging, downwards, in the ordinary colour of the surface-soil of the limestone-region. This layer seemed to go down to the rock at all points, and could be traced, outside, underneath the terrace-wall. It doubtless represents the original packing of earth to level the enclosure; and in that case its red colour is due to prolonged baking by the bonfire on its surface. No figurines or pottery were found in this bottom layer. 2.-TIlE LATER BUILDING. About four metres west of the wall DF, and about one metre south of the rock-line, the workmen struck on the edge of a broken floor of rough unshapen slabs of schist, which soon gave place south-westwards to a plastered and whitewashed mud-floor of the common Eteocretan type. This latter was found to extend, with a broken edge, obliquely as far as the 1 Unfortunately still unpublished except quite summarily in the Times of 7 Nov. 1894, and the Daily Graphic of 28 Dec. 1894: but I had the good fortune to see the section, when the site was about half excavated, in the summer of 1894. 2 Cyprus Afuseum Catalogue, No. 3930: Ohnefalsch-Richter, Kyfros, P1. ccxiii. 5.</page><page sequence="86">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 359 main terrace-wall CD, sealing down the lower layers completely beneath the floor-level of some later structure. The character of this later building was not easy to make out, for except in the S.W. angle of the site almost every trace of it had disap- peared. The S.W. angle itself was occupied by a nearly square chamber three metres from north to south, and somewhat more from west to east. In the latter direction, however, the destruction of the floor and the disappearance of the original north wall left its exact proportions in doubt. Round the wall of this chamber, at an average height of 25 cm. from the floor, ran a rough bench of unworked stones, made good with plaster, and whitewashed like the floor. Similar whitened plaster could be traced here and there up the walls, which were preserved for an average height of half a metre above the bench. The north wall of the chamber was interrupted at a point 2"60 m. from the N.W. angle, by a doorway, set back nearly half the thickness of the wall, and communicating by two steps in the thickness of the remainder with the next room northward (No. II.), the floor-level of which was at least 35 cm. above that of Room I. The absence of a plaster floor, however, prevented any very exact measurement. East of the doorway, the north wall of Room I. seemed either to have been entirely rebuilt, or to have been originally of only half the thickness of that beyond the western jamb. The former alternative seems preferable; for (I) the jamb-stone itself (M) looks like the original jamb-stone turned round and remodelled; (2) the last stone (N) which is preserved eastwards in this wall is a cylindrical base or drum of a column (14 inches in diameter), which cannot have occupied its present position originally ; (3) this drum, and apparently also the stones west of it, rest on the surface of the pavement of schist slabs above mentioned (p. 358), and this pavement ends westward at the point where the bench and the plaster floor of Room I. begin. Probably therefore the wall KL was originally the whole side of Room I., and ended at L in an anta, beyond which began the schist-paved court: then, subsequently, Room II. was prolonged eastward at a higher level, and the wall MN was added on top of the pavement; communica- tion between Rooms I. and lI. being maintained by means of the door LM, of which the anta L now became one of the jambs. Of Room II. almost nothing is preserved. Its north wall, which pro- longed the wall AB eastward, and lay 2'15 m. north of the wall KL, was</page><page sequence="87">360 J. L. MYRES almost wholly destroyed, for only its western end lay below the line where the rock reaches the present surface. There seems, however, to have been a third room, north of Room II., for the wall BC is produced northward; but as almost the whole of this area lies above the soil-line and must have had a floor of made-earth, every trace, except a couple of wall-stones, has been denuded away long since; and the same applies to the larger area north of the wall AB. The date of Room I. and the rest of the later building is given approximately by the character of the bench and the plaster floor, which resemble closely the common work in the houses at Roussolakkos, and should therefore be of Late Min6an or Early Mycenaean period. The schist slabs also are used in exactly the same way as at Roussolakkos. The only object which was found in Room I. was a rough pedestal lamp of serpentine or similar material, about 20 cm. high, and of rude work- manship; but its evidence, such as it is, agrees with the date suggested. It results from this, that the burnt layer, which lies sealed down by the floor of plaster and slabs, must be of yet earlier date; and with this the character of the figurines agrees, as we shall see. The interval, how- ever, between the two strata of occupation does not seem to have been a long one, for there was no trace of a vegetation surface between them; and under these circumstances the superposition, on a site formerly sacred, of a building which is indistinguishable from the domestic buildings of Roussolakkos, seems not a little peculiar, and could hardly have happened if the site had retained any sanctity in the eyes of its later occupants. 3.-THE DEPOSIT OF VOTIVE FIGURINES. The clay figures from the black layer deserve more detailed descrip- tion. Three varieties of clay can be distinguished :- (a) The first is a buff or cream-coloured clay, of a fine dusty texture. It is the debris of the late clayey limestones of the Palaikastro valley, and resembles the clay of the local Min6an (Kam1ires) pottery of Rous- solakkos. This is the clay which is used for the great majority of the figures; and it is susceptible of much greater delicacy of modelling than either of the others. (fi) The second is a rather coarser and more sandy clay, which burns bright red, and may be only a levigated variant of the third ; but it</page><page sequence="88">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 36I resembles rather the coKcLVo Xyta of the limestone region towards Karoximes and Zakro. (y) The third is a quite coarse clay, full of fragments of the schistose basement beds, which crop up in the northward-draining valley immediately to the west of the Petsofi ridge. It is naturally buff in colour, but burns easily to a bright red. Though its texture is so rough, it is the figurines in this clay that exhibit most of the variants of modelled detail: e.g., the male figure with modelled loin-cloth, Fig. [6].1 Most of the large-sized oxen (p. 376), of which only feet and horns are preserved, were also in this clay. Mr. Bosanquet suggests to me that the figurines in claysfl and y are of later fabric than those in clay a; but I am not clear on this point. Most of the larger and better-made figures seem to have had a surface coating of some kind. The commonest (I) is a fine bright reddish- brown slip which is laid on rather thickly, and takes a good burnish, but easily scales away; then comes (2) the lustrous black paint of the ' Kamires ' style of vase-painting, which is much used, on clay a, for male figures, and rarely also for animals. Finally, (3) for the flesh parts of female figures and for details superimposed on the black or brown surface of the men we have the hard dead-white chalky paint which belongs also to the Kamires style. On the white, details are given both in the lustrous black and in a bright brick red which may very well be of the same character as the red slip (I) already mentioned. This scheme of colour-decoration goes far to fix the relative date of the deposit, and to assign it to an early stage of the Min6an period, and this agrees well with the position of the deposit below the floor of a build- ing which is apparently itself of the style of the ordinary houses of Palaikastro. The types of the terracotta figures are as follows:- 4.-HUMAN FIGURES, MALE. These range from 17 to 1o cm. in height; with one larger example in clay y (P1. X, [6]) which measures 12 cm. from shoulder to knee and so must have stood about 22 cm. high. A few, which are quite perfect, stand on small round bases 3"5-4 cm. in diameter [I. 7]; 1 The numerals in square brackets, thus [6], refer to the figures in Plates X-XIII.</page><page sequence="89">362 J. L. MYRES and a number of similar bases, both round and square, were found with the feet attached. The round ones range from a large one, in clay y, of 9 cm. diameter to a finely painted one, in clay a, of 3'5 cm. with black surface, white feet, and a number of vertical bands in white down the edge [12]. The square bases range from 7 to 3"5 cm. with one fragment of a much larger one with a raised rim [14]; and a fragment of a long one ([13] in clay a with brown slip) with the feet of three figures, set at intervals of 5"5 cm. along its edge, with the toes pointing inwards. The last-named fragment suggests a square ring-dance, of the kind which is familiar on Cypriote sites ; 1 and it is noteworthy that one example occurs at Petsoft of a tree- like object [73], like that which forms the centrepiece of the Cypriote rings. The figures all stand erect, with the feet usually close together ; the legs slightly bowed-this may be due to technical difficulties ;-the waist very narrow; and the shoulders broad and well thrown back. The arms are almost always extended to the elbow at an angle of about 600 with the trunk; the forearms are tightly flexed (as in the great relief-fresco from Knossos, B.S.A. vii. Fig. 6), and the hands pressed closely to the body between the shoulders and the breasts. The less finished figures shew a loop at the elbow, and raise the upper arm to 9o1. In no case does the hand appear to be otherwise than tightly clenched. A few variants occur: one small broken figure (clay a, paint 2) presses the right hand on the chest, and raises the left to the head: another (clay /3, paint I) presses both hands on to the belt, a little to the right side; a third-the large figure [6] in clay 7, already mentioned-holds the right arm flexed according to the type, but lets the left hang loosely by the side. The numerous fragmentary figures betray the method of construction. The two legs were modelled in one piece, thigh to thigh, and feet outwards [5]; and the soles of the feet were fully formed. This leg-piece was then folded at the thighs [5], with the loin-cloth fillet laid in the groin, and the feet were pressed into their standing-base [I. 7. 12] and made secure by drawing the surface of the stand round them. Then the upper part of the figure, which was modelled separately, was pressed down upon the outside of the thigh fold a little in front, so as to leave the buttocks prominent ; the body clay was squeezed downwards over the thighs in front [5. 9], and the 1 Cyprus M"useum Catalogue, Nos. 5288, 5290-5, 5297-8, 5305-34, 540ol-66, and references ad loc.</page><page sequence="90">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 363 loin-cloth fillet brought upwards into its place: then the belt, if there was one, was added to disguise the juncture. The larger figures had their arms and heads modelled separately, and attached by squeezing the clay of these appendages over the surface of the trunk fore and aft. The costume is almost always limited to the Aegean loin-cloth and a pair of boots. The latter rise some distance above the ankle, and fit closely; being represented by paint alone. This brings them into line with the ordinary Mycenaean boot-e.g. on the bull-fresco from Tiryns, and on the Vaphio cups. The fact that they are uniformly painted white suggests that they were made of a white or a pale buff-coloured leather like that of the modern high boots for which Crete is famous locally. The toes are well pointed, and turned up slightly, again just like the modern Cretan boots. One of the detached legs [50] shews the heavy sole of the boot quite distinctly. The loin-cloth appears to have consisted of three distinct parts:-- the loin-cloth itself; a white wrapper or kilt (like that of the Keftiu in Egyptian representations), worn over it; and a knotted girdle which secured the whole. Each part of this costume was previously known from numerous monuments; but the statuettes from Petsofit permit for the first time a detailed explanation of it; and also add some fresh points of detail. The loin-cloth itself is represented uniformly by a pronounced roll of clay which runs vertically downwards in front from the middle point of the belt, and disappears from view between the thighs: compare the costume of the small bronze figures from Psychro.1 In the back view, as we shall see, no modelling was required, for the cloth fitted tightly and smoothly over the hips, but it may fairly be supposed that it rejoined the belt, and was passed once or more round the waist before the ends were fastened. In the majority of these statuettes, this simple loin-cloth is represented-either by paint or (in one example) by further modelling-as concealed beneath the smooth surface of the wrapper: but on the Kampos statuette the same garment 2 recurs without disguise, and here its disposition can be clearly followed. On the Kampos statuette the loin-cloth is first drawn round the hips from behind, and two corners are secured together in front, either to one another, 1 Cf. B.S.A. vi. 107, and specimens in the Ashmolean Museum, quoted in the text. 2 Tsountas and Manatt, Tke Mycenaean Age, Plate XVII.</page><page sequence="91">364 J. L. MYRES or to the belt, which is of the normal concave profile (v. below). Then the slack of the belt, which at this stage hangs down behind, is gathered together and drawn forward between the thighs; and then upwards till it rejoins the belt, into which, in this instance, it is apparently inserted from above, and so made fast. In the more pacific of the scenes on the Vaphio cups the herdsman wears an almost identical garment: only in this case the cloth has a well-marked border and hangs a little loosely behind, and the fold in front enters the belt from below. But see also the note on p. 387. Over the loin-cloth comes the wrapper or kilt. This is usually represented in paint only; but fortunately one example, the larger figure in clay y already quoted [6], gives the essential features in relief. It consists of a long rectangle (or perhaps a long truncated wedge) of cloth, represented always in white, with occasional indications of ornamental design in black paint; and it was worn with one of the long edges wrapped tightly round the waist, and one of the short edges hanging vertically in front a little beyond and to the right of the median line, just concealing the central fold of the loin-cloth, like the lappet of a frock coat. When the other end of the loin-cloth comes back to the front round the right hip, its lower edge is always represented on a higher level than before [6. 7]: but it is not quite clear whether this is due to the garment being folded or tucked together, ready for fastening; or whether, as Mr. Dawkins suggests, the wrapper itself was narrower at one end than at the other. Finally, over the wrapper comes the girdle, represented, like the loin- cloth, by an applied fillet of clay. Unlike the girdle of the Kampos statuette, of the men on the Vaphio cups, and of the Knossian cupbearer, it shews no concavity of profile; and does shew, often, clear traces of a knot with dependent ends [I. 7], which is usually placed in the median line, but occasionally on the right hip. In other examples the girdle is represented only in paint, and then shews a double strand, through the loop of which the free ends pass to form a slip-knot. No further trace of fastening is indicated ; and though such must have been present, the slip- knot scheme of the actual representation has its interest, as explaining how the slender waists, which are so characteristic of early Aegean people, were produced and maintained. It should perhaps be noted, in passing, that the more elaborate and apparently claspless belts of the Knossian cupbearer and other larger representations betray in their outline the essentials of their structure. The</page><page sequence="92">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 365 concave profile a is the belt itself, which from its colour, and thin edges, seems to have been a smooth plate of metal. Its out-turned B edges b-b prevent it from chafing the body of the wearer; and this , end is further secured by the torus mouldings c-c, which seem from their form to represent a padded cushion-like belt of some elastic material, which enabled a very considerable pressure to be applied either by means of the metal belt itself, or by a tightly drawn lace or thong wound closely upon its concave surface. In the latter case the smooth ends of the metal belt would slide over one another as the pressure was applied ; and this would explain the absence of any sign of a metallic catch, and also the presence of a lace outside the metallic belt. The loose-looking swollen belts from the shrine of the Serpent-Goddess at Knossos (ante, p. 83, Fig. 58) very likely represent the cushion c-c: which again seems to be represented in the small wreath-like objects to be described below (p. 378). Outside the belt, in front, several of the Petsof, figures wear a large dagger, which measures, together with its hilt, about the length of the wearer's forearm [I. 7. 8]. The dagger is worn nearly horizontally, with the handle usually slightly raised towards the right hand; or occasionally somewhat depressed. The structure of the dagger can be made out fairly clearly. The blade is triangular, and very broad at the base; an Aegean fashion, which is characteristic of the Early Cycladic and Early Min6an period, and disappears later as greater skill is available for the production of a longer and narrower blade. The hilt is represented as of the same type as that on a cameo from Knossos (unpublished), with a distinct pommel, and broad crescentic attachment for the blade.' One painted example gives, in white paint, the edge of a tang, where it would emerge between the flat handle-plates, together with one rivet-head on the grip, and an oval ring on the hand plate, which doubtless represents briefly some form of decorative inlay, though its exact meaning is not clear. One figure [4] wears a bracelet, in relief, on each wrist, and one of the severed hands [42], to be noted below, has a bracelet painted in white. Only one male figure shews any further clothing at all. It is executed, like most of the aberrant examples, in clay 'y, and is much damaged about the extremities, but the essentials of the garment are clear. Fig. [I I] gives the back-view. It consists of a sort of wrapper, in relief, the long ends of SCompare also the Keftiu sword noted by Mr. Hall, B.S.A. viii. p. I71, Fig. 2.</page><page sequence="93">366 J. L. MYRES which cross on the breast, pass over the shoulders, and either meet or cross on the back, where the garment seems to end below the waist. The hood worn by the Kampos statuette would seem at first sight to be a similar garment, girt much more tightly round the neck. On the figurine, however, there is also a tail-like appendage over the buttocks, which may be part of the same garment; and the ragged surface of the flanks suggests that the long ends which cross in front may have passed backwards over the hips and met to form this appendage. It is, however, possible that this appendage is the continuation downwards of the shoulder bands after their crossing on the back, and that the ends which pass from in front under the arms are continuous over the shoulder bands and their prolongation, across the small of the back. In this case the garment would present very close analogies with the Scottish plaid,1 which is first wound round the waist, and then has the ends crossed in front, brought over the shoulders, crossed again on the back, and secured by being tucked through the waist-folds, so that the ends hang down like a tail. The painted examples also shew (I) a broad necklace in white, (2) a bracelet (on the detached hand, [42]) in white fastened by a loop which passes over a button. The button is in relief, and the thick white engobe raises the surface slightly for the loop also. This actual representation of a button-and-loop fastening has an obvious bearing upon the problem of Aegean dress. The figures, though small and rudely finished, are modelled in a vigorous and lifelike manner; and the larger specimens betray consider- able observation of the natural form. The same is clearer still in the detached limbs described below, and in the few fragments of larger figures in clay 7. The head, as usual, presented the greatest difficulties. Aegean tradition dictated an upturned face, low forehead, and prominent occiput; but the nose is here well marked and slightly aquiline, and the chin long and pointed: compare the Amorgine marble head, of more advanced style, in the Ashmolean Museum. The orbits are rendered, as usual, by pinching the clay on either side of the nose into large, shallow, saucer-like depres- sions; and the eyes are rendered either by pellets in relief [2], by a further depression in the centre of the orbital hollow [3. 6], or, without any modelling, by a white ring on the black surface [I. 4- 37]. This last method 1 I owe this suggestion to Mr. W. L. H. Duckworth.</page><page sequence="94">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 367 conforms exactly with that employed in the human figure from Kamires,' and agrees with the inferences already drawn from the general style of the painted decoration. The ears, rendered by pellets in relief, are large and rather prominent [5. 37] ; but a distinct attempt is perceptible sometimes to render their true form by a crescent-shaped pellet with central cusp on the concave margin [I. 3]. Compare also now, for greater detail, the ' fisher- man' from Phylakopi (Phylakopi, P1. III.). The treatment of the hair varies. Many figures have no special indi- cations; others have one, two, or three bun-like discs, set along the median line from the forehead to the nape of the neck [I. 3. 6]; and one head, whose eyebrows and nose have been emphasised with a knife, and which has a slit cut for the mouth, has a long scalp-lock coming forward from the vortex and falling slightly to the left side [2]. The chin of one figure seems to have been intentionally depressed, and may have been meant to show a beard. 5.-HUMAN FIGURES : FEMALES. The normal type of the female figures, which are much fewer than the males, is bell-shaped or conical from the waist downwards, to represent the full skirts of Aegean costume. This part of the figure, which usually stands about 8 cm. high ([21. 24] cf. P1. VII I, full size), seems to be wheel-made, and has nearly the form of the common beaker-type of Palaikastro, but baseless and inverted. Sometimes it has a flat inward rim for strength; and in one example [28] it has a distinct torus-moulding round the apex.2 Into this apex was thrust the upper part of the body, which was moulded separ- ately, and ended in a long peg [22] for securer junction with the skirt-piece. Some of these skirts shew traces of brown, black, or white surface-colour : the most elaborately decorated example is given in P1. VIII; another has white vertical bands on a brown surface; and another, horizontal white lines across the hips, on black. The larger coarsely-modelled fragment [27], in clay y, shews an overskirt, with a flounce or lappet emerging from beneath it, and one pendent end of a belt, and thus recalls other features of the Knossian costume. The upper part of the figures is of somewhat remarkable construction. 1 Proc. Sac. Antriq. Land. II. Ser. xv. P1. II. 2. 2 I think it is very likely, from the clean modelling of this waist-belt, that this may have been a votive skirt of the same class as the votive dresses of the Knossian deposit (ante, p. 83, Fig. 58).</page><page sequence="95">368 J. L. M-YRES It was built up as follows. A lozenge-shaped plate of clay was made, to represent the bodice of the dress; and its two lateral angles were drawn out to form the arms. The head, modelled separately with a long stalk-like neck, was then laid face upwards on this plate, along its longer diameter. Then the margins of the plate, below the level of the arms, were drawn forward, like the spathe of an arum-lily, to enfold the lower part of the neck, and so to form a thicker stalk or peg for insertion in the apex of the skirt-piece. The junction was smoothed over by squeezing the body-clay downwards over the upper part of the skirt, and sometimes a heavy fillet of clay [23] was added, over all, to represent the padded girdle. Independent models of the girdle were found, as at Knossos (p. 83), and will be noted below ([32, 33], p. 378). The junction of neck and bodice was similarly remodelled, and disguised by the addition of pellets of clay for the breasts [21-24]; and finally the arms were brought forward rather above the horizontal line [22]. Probably the hands met in an attitude of adoration, like those of the Cypriote statuettes, of which further mention is made below (p. 372); but unfortunately, in this extended posture, they were exposed to risks, and no complete example has been recovered. The result of the whole is a representation of a loose open corsage, about 4 centimetres high from waist to neck, enveloping the breast from the shoulders downwards, but displaying the whole neck, and the upper part of the bust, within a wide standing-collar of the ' Medici' type which rises to a high point at the back of the head: and it recalls at once the squarer standing-collars and epaulettes of the seated ladies in the miniature frescoes of Knossos.1 Several fragments shew traces of paint on the bodice. More elaborate painting than anything actually found at Petsofi is represented on a very similar terracotta from the settlement-site at Phylakopi in Melos. This example I am enabled, by the kindness of Mr. Bosanquet, to represent in Fig. I (a, 1, c) herewith. In a we have the front view of the upper part of the body, with stumps of neck and arms (which are bare), and a large and regular round opening between the latter, which looks as if it may have been the mark of a vase: Mr. Bosanquet suggests that the whole figure formed an anthropomorphic vase. The peg-end of the neck projects into the interior, and can be seen 1 Candia Museum: the majority are unpublished still, but examples will be found in J.H.S xxi. P1. V. and B.S.A. vii. Fig. 17.

Another [23] shews by the course of the free front edge of the bodice that this garment was not a mere wrapper, but a sort of 'zouave' jacket with sleeves; for the free edge closely envelopes the breasts and is pressed open by them, while it is confined at the waist by a substantial girdle, knotted in front, and falling in long ends over the skirt. The stumps of the broken arms, meanwhile, can be seen, well away from the hem; and the same is clear, as the red patch shews in the example in P1. VIII. An identical garment is recognisable in the central figure of the BB</page><page sequence="97">370 J. L. MYRES gold pin-head from Shaft Grave III. ; in the bronze figure from the Troad,2 which shews well a fresh variant of the standing collar ; and (in far more realistic detail) in the glazed figures from the Knossian deposit, pp. 75 foil. Figs. 54-57, where one can see the tight-fitting sleeves, ending half-way above the elbow, and even the lacing of the bodice. In the same example, also [23], the left arm, instead of being raised, is brought round on to the right side of the girdle, above the hip, where a fragment of the hand remains in place. The same variant occurs in one of the male figures already described. If now, ais seems probable, the right arm was represented raised in the normal posture, the pose of the figure would be very nearly that of the bronze already quoted. One other fragment, with arms well raised, and the bodice-collar drawn very low, is certainly represented as pregnant ; ~ the rest, eight examples in all, have the ordinary contour and pose of Mycenaean women. The faces of the women, mutatis mutandis, resemble those of the men ; but instead of the brown or black paint they have usually traces of a dull white surface on the flesh-parts; while the eyes are indicated, if at all, by a black dot on the white ground, with or without a black eyebrow over it. The lips also are sometimes indicated; and once, quite clearly, with red pigment. One detached head is executed wholly in a white chalky clay which does not appear otherwise on the site, and may be a lump of the white pigment; and it is probable that two brown-surfaced examples have merely lost or omitted the white paint appropriate to their sex: for a number of similar examples wholly covered (like them) with a dense layer of the dark pigment bear clear traces of a superposed layer of the white. The most noteworthy feature of the female figures, however, is their head-gear, which is very peculiar, and I think quite unparalleled. It is a kind of oval crownless hat, rather like the 'plate-hat' of recent fashion- books (1902-3), which is attached, far back on the head, by its hinder margin, and sweeps forward above the forehead in a high curve not unlike that of a short broad shoe-horn, convex side forwards and downwards, with its lateral margins slightly recurved so that its upper and posterior surface 1 Schliemann, Mycenae, Fig. 392 ; better drawn in Tsountas and Manatt, The Mycenaean Age, Fig. 67. 2 Perrot-Chipiez, vi.

The effect is sprightly and not ungraceful; and as the hat often rises to nearly twice the height of the face which it adorns,' the original must have been a 'creation' of some splendour. Proportions and curvature varied selon la mode; and, for the artist at all events, the more pronounced the coiffure, the less refined need be the features beneath it. In the normal examples, there is no clear demarcation between the hat and the head; and as the painted ornament of the figures in Plate VIII. will shew, the same pigment is employed for the body of the hat and for the indented border which limits the face. It might therefore be argued that we have to deal rather with a coiffure than with a hat; and abundant examples could be quoted of even bolder triumphs of hair-dressing. But the variants which are described below seem to connect the normal and most characteristic type with the well-known later series of Mycenaean women's hats: and the occurrence of elaborate head-gear, though not of this pattern, among the Knossian deposit, makes the hypothesis of a hat more probable at present. A very similar head-dress is shewn on a gem from the Italian excavations. Whether hat or hair, however, the painted ornament gives a fair idea of the trimming. One example [I9], on a black ground, has two broad horizontal stripes of white on the frontward surface: another, on brown, has two white concentric rings on the concave upper side: and a third, on an upper surface of black, has white rays diverging from the centre, and large white dots round the rim. Three very distinct variants are represented by single examples. One lady [I6] has crimped the brim of her hat, and added three large rosettes, represented by pellets, in the recesses thus formed beneath the brim. She has also decorated the upper side, along the longer diameter of the oval, with something between a plume and a frill, which has fairly puzzled the coroplast: it may perhaps be allied to the sinuous tail which emerges from the turban-like hats of the late Mycenaean women and FIG. 2.-MODERN HATS IN THE MODE OF PETSOFi. 1 The head ranges from I"5 to 2 centimetres high: the hat from 2"5 to 3 centimetres. See [i8. 19. 36] and Plate VIII. BB2</page><page sequence="99">372 J. L. MYRES sphinxes.1 This hat is an 'arrangement in white,' to judge from the remains of the painting. The second variant [17. 20] shews a less fanciful type, worn much further forward on the head, and suggestive of a funnel-shaped polos like the late Mycenaean head-gear already mentioned ; 2 which is itself, in turn, ancestral, probably, to the polos of the Boeotian figurines. This figure has also large eye-pellets and a long, deeply pinched nose-ridge, like that which, later on, determines the technical tradition of the figurines of the Argive Heraeum. The third variant [I 5] is equally instructive. The hat is worn fairly well forward, as in the last example, but the brim is turned up all round so as to form a deep bowl; the fantastic peak of the normal type surviving in an anterior lip like that of an oinochoe, or of the saucer-lamp of early Cyprus. Here we seem to have a very early analogy, and perhaps even the prototype, of a rare group of Cypriote votive figurines of the Iron Age,3 in which a female figure bears a regular saucer-lamp on her head. Yet the lamps of these figures have never been used as lamps, and the figures themselves, apart from their peculiar head-gear, are identical with the large class of votive figurines in association with which they occur: they usually carry tympana or votive offerings like those described below, and certainly are not primarily lampadephoroi. If, however, these lamp-like hats were revivals, either in ritual or merely in votive tradition, of a lamp-like hat of Mycenaean and earlier date, we should obtain at the same time an explanation of these Cypriote figurines, and also an interesting addition to a group of analogies to which we shall have to recur later on. The wearer of this lamp-like hat at Petsofi was modelled in clay 7, which we have already seen to be liable to give variant forms; she has almost no collar -only the rising point behind; her ears are transformed into large round pellets4 high up on the lower margin of the hat; she has traces of the concave Mycenaean girdle; and her arms trend more outwards and down- wards than usual, as if she were carrying some offering; which would 1 E.g.

II. 373 supply a further analogy with Cypriote forms, and is confirmed by the occurrence, as noted below, of fragments of such offerings at Petsofi; and by the scars of attachment, on the front of the body of this figure, Another fragment of a woman in clay 7 shews points of similarity with this figure, but the head is missing. Another female type of much meaner pretensions is represented by a very few examples [24]. The skirt has sunk to be a mere trumpet-like base; the peaked collar is gone, and the body is a mere rude column with stumpy arms, recurved on the breast, when they are preserved. The face is a mere serrated ridge; the hat a simple disc, degenerate from our second variant above; and there is no trace of paint. Here, in fact, we have the lowest term of the series, when the significance of the prototype is almost lost, but when the Mycenaean art of a later age has not yet taken up the meaningless base or head-piece to transform them into the purely conventional ' bird-faced idol' of Mycenae, Tiryns, and other sites on the mainland; the ancestry of which has been hitherto quite obscure, but to which this group of little figures seems to supply an archetype. 6.-HUMAN FIGURES, SEATED. The male and female figures already described all stand erect: but there is a small class of seated human figures of which the sex is not clear; and these may be described conveniently now. One of them [26], very fragmentary, in clay /3, sits in a high-backed chair, which has almost crowded away the arms; as the stumps of the legs are distinct, it is probably male: the legs of the chair and the head of the figure are missing; another, however, which shews the legs, has a female bust, and white surface. Another, in clay a, sits, with legs wide apart, on a four-legged chair, of which the back is missing; it has good black surface, with traces of white paint. Another, [25] separated from its chair, wears a long white-painted garment from head to ankles: the feet are formless, and project in the line of the thighs; head and arms are missing. A single example occurs also of a roughly made female bust-head, arms, and skirt missing-in clay 7, with white slip all over, and without trace of the peaked collar; apparently therefore nude, so far as it exists; unless, as is probable, we may assume the presence of the skin-tight vest</page><page sequence="101">374 J. L. MYRES which seems to be present in the glazed figures from the Knossian deposit. With the seated figures may be reckoned a few detached chairs and fourlegged stools [77-9]: one stands on a square base, and another base [79] shews traces of a similar chair; one has a modelled seat like that of the Throne at Knossos; but this may be merely the result from the pressure of the figurine. All (except the damaged example [79]) have the legs widely splayed outwards on the sides, and have the seat short from front to back, like that of a campstool. 7.-VOTIVE ARMS, LEGS, AND HEADS. One of the most marked peculiarities of Petsofi is the series of detached arms, legs, and heads, modelled separately, and often perforated at the butt-end for suspension. The arms are usually given from the shoulder downwards, extended or somewhat flexed : they are coloured either white (probably for women) or brown-red or black (for men); and they measure from 8 to 12 cm. from shoulder to finger-tip. One white one [4I] includes, besides the whole arm, a full quarter of the trunk, and its suspension hole is at the angle of the latter nearest to the place of the neck. Others represent only the forearm; and one black one [42]-which seems to have telescoped the whole arm, and indicates an elbow close to the wrist-has a large, vigorously modelled hand, and on the wrist a button in relief, which fastens the white-paint bracelet already men- tioned (p. 366). Another white specimen [44] gives only the hand in full (4 cm. long), but still retains a slight projection about 5 cm. from the finger-tips, which seems once more to represent the elbow joint, and so the whole arm. Two smaller expanded hands [45] with thumb well turned back as on the Kam~ires potsherd (Proc. Soc. Ant. Lond. II. Ser. xv. P1. II. 2) may be from whole figures, as their other extremity is broken; but, as is noted above (p. 362), all the figures which preserve their arms entire seem to have their hands clenched. The legs range in size with the arms ([49-51]: thigh to heel 8-I I cm.) and ate always fully extended, as if standing. One complete pair was found [48] (besides fragments) terminating in a waist, and formless trunk, about 2 cm. high. The legs are coloured like the arms; and one black- surfaced specimen shews a white boot like those of the statuettes; an-</page><page sequence="102">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 375 other [50] shews well both sole and heel, separately applied; and another [49] seems to indicate the toes. In one case a detached foot may have been intended to be independent; but a rounded socket in the ankle suggests that it was merely fashioned separately and has been insecurely fastened to its leg. One example was found [47] of a trunk shewing stumps of legs, and a loin-cloth in relief: it was in clay y, and much damaged. Among the many detached heads which were found, there seemed to be a distinct class which had been so modelled originally. These votive heads [36-40] are all of small size from I15 to 2 cm. diameter-and very rudely modelled. Some have shouldered busts; but, in others, the neck tapers away for about I"5 cm. into a sort of wedge [36-7], or in the smaller examples into a mere peg [38-40]. Both male and female examples occur, and the latter [36] are distinguished as usual by their hats. 8.-LARGER HUMAN FIGURE. Close to the surface, in the rock-cleft H, at the east end of the site, was found the only fragment of advanced style which emerged in the course of the excavation. It is part of a human face [34], modelled by hand in clay ry with traces of a coarse, red-brown surface; and it preserves the left eye, the nose (damaged at the tip and over the left nostril), and part of the left cheek. The height of the nose from root to base is 6 centimetres; and the extreme length of the eye 3 centimetres nearly. The eye is modelled with heavy upper and lower lids, almost symmetrical, and completely separated by an incision at each end ; and the pupil is oval, flattened, and somewhat prominent. The nose rises abruptly from the face, with nearly flat sides, to an acute ridge which ran up boldly between the eyes to join the brows, the beginning of the curve being nearly "5 centimetre higher than the axis of the eye. The tip is only very slightly bulbous, and its vertical angle is about 9o0. It is highly tilted, the length from base to tip being 3"5 centimetres, and from tip to root 4"3; allowing in both cases for the damaged tip, and measuring to the intersection of the outlines which are preserved. The nostrils are but slightly expanded: the outline from bridge to lobe being even slightly convex: and the outer margin of the nostrils came originally almost as low as the inner. The space from nose to lip must have been considerable, as nearly I centimetre width is pre- served, with very slight outward curvature at its lower edge. All these</page><page sequence="103">376 J. L. MYRES points combine to separate this figurine from all the orientalising schools, and to make it probable that we are dealing with a chef-d'ceuvre of approximately the same date and style as the rest of the objects in clay ry. 9.-ANIMALS AND MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS. By far the most frequent figurines on the site are representations of animals. These fall into two main divisions; (I) large figures of oxen, preserved only in fragments; and (2) miniature figures of various domestic and other animals in a 'snow man' style, ranging from 3 to 7 centimetres in length. Of the large oxen, only horns [81] and legs [82] were found, and one or two fragments of hind-quarters. The horns ranged from I2"5 to 5 centimetres in length, and were all of the same slightly curved and twisted type as those of the modern Cretan cattle; they had been moulded separately, and attached imperfectly to the head. The legs also had been moulded separately, and very ill attached to the trunk: with the exception of one doubtful example of 13 centimetres length by 7 centimetres greatest breadth, their dimensions ranged from 13 centimetres to 6 centimetres from hoof to the junction with the body; and from 6 centimetres to 3'5 centimetres diameter at the latter point. All fabrics are represented; but the largest specimens are in clay y, and the best modelled, which were of about medium size, are in a variety of clay a, with black surface, white hoofs, and in one case a white rosette on the outer surface of the leg. Another well-marked variety, of rather slenderer proportions, is executed in clay fi, and covered with a white surface. Detached legs of oxen, apparently modelled singly like the human legs above mentioned, were found occasionally; but the majority of the legs were broken from figures of whole oxen. The almost complete absence of the bodies of the oxen may perhaps be accounted for by periodical removal of the larger and less recognisable fragments from the place of deposit: the horns and legs of oxen thus constructed would be among the first fragments to become detached, especially if they were exposed, as is probable, to heat in a sacrificial fire; and without these appendages the trunks would not be easily recognised, in the ash-heap, as objects of any use or value. Search was made in the neighbourhood of the shrine for traces of a rubbish-heap of such bodies;</page><page sequence="104">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 377 and subsequently Mr. Bosanquet found fragments of such bodies below the rocks immediately on the north side of the site.1 The miniature animals vary in detail, between easily recognisable types. Oxen, with horns either straight or curved, were the commonest [53]; agrimi, goats [58] and rams [54] were recognisable by their horns; swine [57] by their bristly crest; and dogs [55] by their prick-ears, long slim body, upturned tail, and legs extended fore and aft as in running [55]. Another animal [56], with long neck and tail, pointed nose, prick-ears, and a peculiar kink in the body, was variously identified by the workmen as cat, fox, or weasel.2 Another group seemed to represent a crouching hare, with three variants; one ([6o] 5"5 cm. long) in which the ears are united in a long backward curving horn; one ([63] 3 cm. long) in which the ears are diminished to a small pellet on the back of the neck, while the body has three longitudinal furrows; and a third, in clay 7, and of larger size (8'5 cm. long [62]) and hollow, in which six incised lines radiate from a point behind the shoulders, and two short lines cross the top of the head. The head has a short broken horn, and the hind foot is punctured as if to indicate digits: the snout is slightly upturned. I am not quite sure whether this3 may not perhaps be a hedgehog (bydaO6Xoopo9). Tortoises are represented by several quite recognisable examples [6I]. Birds occurred rarely [59], of the common votive type with outspread wings and three short feet; one of them had the wings reduced or closed; and another, in clay a, has good black surface, and traces of white paint. A few of the quadrupeds also shewed traces of black or white surface; and one goat was painted, the front half in red, the hind quarters in white. One or two variants occurred, such as a crouching pig without legs (3 cm. long), and a recumbent calf [72], modelled rudely but with some spirit, on the lower side of which were traces of two strap-like supports. Probably this calf has been detached 1 It is perhaps worth noting that an obscure fragment [76] bought at Palaikastro, and said to have been found formerly on the surface at Roussolakkos, turns out to be the ear of a similar ox of large size, excavated in clay, with black and white surface-paint, and a long nick or owner's mark indicated in relief down the lobe. Mr. Bosanquet has also found a complete ox of this type on a rock-brow near Epano Zakro, together with votive human legs of the kind described above. 2 Probably the Coupi~a, a polecat or stoat, the fur of which is in some demand in the towns now: or perhaps the smaller caAofyevoitoa, which Mr. Bosanquet tells me may be a weasel. The fox does not occur in Crete now. 8 And perhaps also the second type [62-3].</page><page sequence="105">378 J. L. MYRES from a large human figure, which carried it as an offering in its arms: compare the series from Kamelarga1 and numerous isolated examples. Io.-OTHER VOTIVE OFFERINGS. That such figures, carrying offerings or attributes, were in use at Petsoft is clear from the following further examples :-(I) a dish [64], on a high twisted foot of indeterminate form (3 cm. high), broken away below, and bearing three long loaves or other offerings on its upper surface. The distortion of the foot is due, as in the Cypriote examples, to the mode of attachment: the offering being modelled separately, and plastered on to the front of the bearer. (2) A scallop-edged plate [65], with a single loaf on it, and what appears to be a hand passing over the rim: broken away on the side which would be next to the body of the bearer, if the hand were the right hand. (3) A miniature jug [68], with high neck and loop-handle, spout broken, and base distorted by attachment to a support. (4) A larger and very rude example [67] of a similar offering, in clay, with a broken stalk below. (5) Two wreath-like fillets [32-3], one with crossed ends, both in clay 7.3 These may be actually wreaths, as I suggested in the Cypriote instances; but they may also very probably be dedicated girdles, like those in the Knossian deposit.4 (6) Several examples occurred [75] of deep conical cups from 6'5 to 5 cm. high, and from 5 to 3 cm. across the rim, which have likewise been distorted below by attachment to their bearers.5 One of them, in clay 3, has a good black surface; two others shew traces of the brick-red. (7) A very small and abbreviated rendering ([3o]: 3"5 cm. high) of the human female type with peaked collar, in clay 3, with fine black surface and traces of white paint. The head is missing, and the body from the waist downwards is distorted by attachment to a smooth surface like that of the skirted figures already described (p. 368), part of the substance 1 CyGprus Museum Catalogue, p. 153 ft., esp.

II. 379 of which has been squeezed up over the lower margins of this figure, to keep it in place. Traces of white paint on the rough back of this little figure shew that the figure which carried it was fully painted before the infant (as it appears to be) was attached ; and the hands, raised and clasped in an attitude of adoration, complete the parallel with C.M.C. p. 153, No. 5520, cf. J.H.S. xvii. p. 167 (Ashmolean Museum), and ' bird- faced' figures from Mycenae 1 and elsewhere. (8) A very much ruder figure [3I], club-shaped, forked and fractured below,and endingabove in a human face, with the disc-like male coiffure above described, seems to be of the same purpose. A narrow fillet of clay, preserved with it, was loosely attached, when it was found, to the right side of the head, explaining the absence of the right ear: this fillet, which became detached in transit to Palaikastro, represented the right arm of the infant, raised to the head in a familiar Aegean gesture. The still ruder figure [Io] prob- ably represents another male child. (9) Another object [74] of uncertain use, in clay 7, was certainly attached to some support, and probably represents some votive offering. It consists of two fillets of clay I cm. thick, coiled into C-spirals, and set back to back with a small pellet in each angle of juncture. The whole measures 5 cm. along the junction, and 5"5 across the two C-spirals. The scar of attachment is clearly seen extending from one of the juncture pellets across one of the four spirals, over a space 3 cm. by "5 cm. The only other objects which need record are:- (Io) A number of miniature vases 3-3"5 cm. high, all of the same deep- rimmed bowl-form [69-71 ], with one, two, or three small vertical handles, set about the greatest diameter of the body. Those which are whole shew no signs of attachment; and they are probably analogous to the miniature vases which occur copiously in one of the caves on Mt. Juktas, and in the 'altar of burnt offering' on the principal acropolis of Idalion. (II) A very large number of small clay balls [66], from 2"5 to I"5 cm. in diameter, well rounded, but without ornament or appendage of any kind. (12) A rude representation [73], in clay 7, about 6 cm., of a tree of exactly the same kind as that which is so common in certain Cypriote sanctuaries, particularly at Soloi and Khytroi.2 The present example, which 1 'Ep.

MYRES is about 6 cm. high, spreads out below into a standing base which has incrustation on the underside. It is, however, not clear whether it was an independent offering, or part of a larger group like the Cypriote ring- dances already quoted (p. 362). (13) A small fragment, in clay a, of a flat plaque, I cm. thick, with a straight raised edge, I cm. high, on which remain apparently two hand-like appendages, which grasp the rim from the inner side. It seems to be a base of some kind, as the underside is rough; but whether the appendages are hands, or distorted feet, or merely parts of a chair or other super- structure, cannot be determined now. (14) One or two small fragments seem to have represented implements of some kind; but their purpose is quite obscure. I I.-INTERPRETATION OF THE VOTIVE OFFERINGS. Perhaps a word should be added as to the probable motives for so varied an accumulation of objects. That the deposit was of a votive purpose. seems clear from the miniature scale of che figurines themselves, from their position in a single ash-layer, from the devotional gestures of the women, and from the character of the objects,-men, women, and cattle,-which formed by far the largest section of the offerings. Of the character and attributes of the deity, the collection tells us nothing; double-axes, serpents, and crosses, for example, are conspicu- ous by their absence; and the rarity of the tortoises (which might at first sight suggest an Aphrodite-cult), and the early date of the deposit, make it probable that these figures belong to the imprecatory, not to the symbolic group. The probability, also, that we have to do with the everyday costume, both of men and of women, suggests that the human figures represent not the deity but the votaries. Neither human figures nor those of cattle need detailed comment: both are ubiquitous on sacred sites, in the Aegean and elsewhere: and both are offered for a variety of purposes to secure the divine protection, whether burned or merely deposited in the sacred place; and also, when burned or 'passed through the fire,' to purify or to effect a counter-charm.1 1 Frazer, Golden Bough,2 iii. 265 if. 320. Kolben, State of the Cape, i. 129. Wuttke, Deutsche Volksaberglaube, p. 80.</page><page sequence="108">EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO. II. 38I The limbs, too, and the furniture, miniature vases, and articles of dress, are commonplaces of dedicatory ritual.1 The animals carried, as some of the fragments shew, by human votaries are more probably offerings than symbols; especially in view of the analogy e.g. of the Kamelarga series in Cyprus already quoted ; and of the association, in both cases, of offerings of food and drink with the offerings of whole animals. Only three groups, therefore, offer any real difficulty: the bisected human figures, the offerings of wild animals, especially of vermin, and the aniconic spheres. (I) Several examples occurred of ordinary male figures quite naked (i.e. without foot-stand or loin-cloth 2) and bisected from crown to groin by a clean cut [35]. These are susceptible of more than one inter- pretation. They may have been attempts to exhibit more exactly the seat of internal disease; and in that case would fall into line with the detached arms, legs, and other parts of the body. Or they may refer to some such sacrificial rite as the 'Sawing the Old Woman' which Dr. Frazer has discussed at length,3 especially connected, as this is, with magical attempts to secure 'good luck' for the survivors and their belong- ings. If, however, any such ritual had been in question, even annually, one would have expected something more than a rare variant: and I incline to the first interpretation above. (2) The dedication of wild animals usually comes about as a' first-fruit' of the chase ; * and the frequent occurrence of dogs at Petsoft gives colour to this interpretation of the second class of figures. But the absence of the larger kinds of game, and particularly of the Cretan agrimi, puts it almost out of court; and the consideration that the commonest non-domestic animal at Petsoft is the weasel or some such definitely noxious animal, and that the hedgehog also is in widespread evil repute among pastoral peoples on the charge of 'sucking the cows,' suggests rather that these vermin are offered by way of imprecation, or out of gratitude for deliverance from their ravages. Compare the Hellenic mouse-cult in the Troad,5 and the mice and snakes in Palestine.6 Actual cases of analogous vermin-offerings are 1 Instances in Rouse, Greek Votive Offerin s, p. 2II ff.

The custom of throwing pebbles, pellets, and missiles of various kinds either into bonfires or into sacred places or at a cult-object is very widespread,7 and easily intelligible. Its least obscure form is the common Buddhist ritual of writing a petition on a slip of paper, rolling or chewing this into a pellet, and throwing or spitting it at the cult-image; if the pellet sticks, the prayer is heard. And there are in any case so many favours which might be asked, or benefits to be acknowledged, which do not lend themselves to iconic treatment, that it is not at all surprising to find such pellets, in a fire-proof material, associated with so omnivorous a bonfire as that of Petsofi. 12.-AEGEAN WOMEN'S-DRESS, AND ITS AFFINITIES.

II. 383 Europe, challenges more detailed examination than the limits of this paper allow; but a brief summary of the problem as it presents itself now is perhaps permissible here. The skirt, suspended from the waist and gathered there into a tight waistband, and the bodice, sleeved or sleeveless, and more or less com- pletely open from the neck to the waist, have a very long history on European soil; at least as long a history as the open-sided 'Doric chiton' in North Africa, or the full-length sleeved 'Ionic chiton,' and its open- fronted 'dressing-gown' counterpart, in Hither Asia. The evidence for this long history is threefold. (I) In all the more inaccessible regions of Central Europe, and especially along the Alpine barrier, survives a series of peasant-costumes, which, however they may differ in detail, are fundamentally identical in type. They all include the full tight-waisted skirt, and the open-fronted bodice; and wherever underclothing of the Oriental linen type has established itself as part of the costume, the bodice has become low-necked in front, and either sleeveless or open-sleeved, so as to exhibit as much as possible of the linen-wear. (2) If this costume were confined to the highlands of Alpine Europe, it would not of necessity be of ancient descent: but in fact a similar series appears almost universally in the long-isolated highlands, netherlands, and islands of Western Europe; in the Pyrenees, in Brittany, in Wales and Scotland, in the Low Countries, and in Scandinavia : from which it may be inferred that the costume goes back to a time when these western regions of survival enjoyed a common culture with the Alpine regions; and this time is clearly very remote, and certainly anterior to the great series of lowland migrations which make up the pre-history of the European penin- sula from the Bronze Age onwards. (3) Certain monuments, of various early though uncertain dates, give rude representations of bodice-and-skirt costumes which are essentially similar to the type: e.g. the figurine from Kli~evac in Servia,1 the stele from Korosbanya in Siebenburgen,2 the incised representations on the black polished vases from tumuli at Oedenburg.3 (4) One actual example of the costume in question has survived from the Early Bronze Age of Denmark; namely the bodice and skirt from the 1 Iloernes, Urgeschichte der Kunst., Pl.

MYRES tumulus of Borum-Eshoi : and a comparison of the dressmaker's diagram for this bodice with that for the Cretan bodice shews at once how faithfully the type persists from end to end of its area of distribution. The only difference, in fact, is that whereas in Denmark the neck is inserted through a slit in the cloth, so that the breast is fully covered, as befits a cold climate and linenless culture, in Crete, which is southerly, warmer, and in sea-communication with an immemorial linen-centre in Egypt, the neck flap is cut clean away over each shoulder, and by standing up behind the head when the garment is made up, gives rise to the characteristic Cretan collar which reveals itself thus as an instructive survival of a very primitive expedient of the dress-maker.

II. 385 Under these circumstances, the new data contributed by the Aegean finds are two. Firstly, the evidence from Mycenae shews that the bodice- and-skirt costume was in vogue over a prolongation of the Alpine region far further south-eastward than there was any reason previously to suspect: into an area, in fact, the oldest historical costume of which, the ' Doric chiton' of Herodotus,1 was not an A'v&amp;vta but an &amp;qif3Xrn.a, and was of a type which has its survivals only on the southern coastlands of the Mediterranean, in the uniform costume of the peasant-women from Morocco to Egypt. Secondly, the evidence from Crete not only puts back the vogue of this costume to a far earlier date than the examples from Mycenae would indicate; but also, thanks to the remoteness of Crete and the marked originality of its Min6an culture, justifies the same inference which was drawn above from the remote and long-isolated areas of Northern and Western Europe: namely, that the analogies between primitive Aegean and primitive European costumes may fairly be inferred to result rather from a very ancient community of culture, than from any recent intrusion, cultural or political, on either side of the comparison. Crete, in fact, stands out once more-as neolithic Knossos would seem already to suggest,-as an outpost, eastwards, of chalcolithic, if not of neolithic Europe. From this conclusion it would seem to result that the rare monuments of early female costume in the intervening and adjacent areas must be subjected to fresh review. In particular, the occurrence, on one of the clay 'idols' from Hissarlik,2 of neck line and waist line, connected by a vertical line down the front of the body, would seem to result, probably, from an attempt to render the main outlines of just such a jacket-bodice as has been described: and then the well-known 'idol' with the 'cross- over' costume 3 would fall into its place in the series. It will also be necessary to reconsider the prevalent opinion that the female figures from the Thracian tumuli and from the megalithic monuments of Malta are intended to be represented as nude, and as steatopygous4: for one of the Thracian figures has elaborate surface ornamentation (usually described as tattoo marks), and one of the Maltese 1 ~re~ i~ 'yE EXA',7YLK~ E'O6~JS 7raOcL ~ apxa&amp;~ ~wv 7uvasKwi/ ~1 aur~ ?~V &lt;Kcd&gt; -r~v z4~v z~wpiaa xaXeoF4ev, Hdt.

MYRES ones1 has a well-marked horizontal subdivision about the level of the knees, which can hardly be anything but a fold or flounce of a skirt. It may even be questioned whether the so-called 'steatopygia' of these figures may not be partly due to the attempt to render the voluminous skirts of a sitting figure: compare, for example, the attitude of the seated and skirted ladies in the Knossian miniature-frescoes with that of the majority of the Maltese figures.2 How long did the Aegean retain the bodice-and-skirt costume of the Min6an and Mycenaean Ages ? The' bird-faced' idols of Mycenae, Tiryns, and other Mycenaean sites on the mainland of Greece, stand clearly enough on the upper side of the line; for the scheme of the painted ornament differs, almost universally, on the skirt, and above the waist; and the two regions are usually separated by a well-marked belt. The case is less clear in regard to the monuments of the next period; the women on the Dipylon vases, and on the similar vases from Amyclae, retain the dis- tinction of tints, and have a thoroughly Mycenaean waist-curve; some of the Boeotian figurines, with their reminiscences of the Mycenaean hat, preserve, in spite of their lack of 'waist,' a differentiation of ornament which recalls the treatment of the Mycenaean ' bird-faced' type; and a similar decorative tradition runs far down into early Hellenic vase- painting, and gives rise to manifold confusion there. It is difficult, for example, to believe, in spite of the long and perplexing series of inter- mediates, that the women on the engraved cuirass from Olympia 3 are not intended to be represented in bodices and skirts, defined at the junction by a tight-fitting belt of the ancient type: and in the case of the very remarkable series of leaden votive figures from the 'Menelaion' in Laconia,' the balance of evidence certainly seems to incline to the view now suggested: yet the male figures of the same series wear regular hoplite armour, and can hardly be of earlier date than the seventh or eighth century. On the literary side, similarly, the current views may well need drastic revision; now that Studniczka's comment on the 1jvOea L/epOeJJra 1 Perrot-Chipiez iii., Fig. 231. 2 Perrot-Chipiez iii., Fig. 230.

II. 387 of the Homeric 1 Aphrodite has found so marked endorsement in the Knossian deposit. Finally, if the old Aegean dress can be traced surviv- ing, locally at all events, on into the very twilight of Hellenism, what is its relation to that long series of modern peasant costumes in the Cyclades and in Crete, which, evading the taint of the Anatolian (and eventu- ally Mohammedan) dressing-gown costume of the 'Albanian' area, still retain the full tightly-gathered skirt, and the tight-laced, often sleeveless, and always open-fronted jacket-bodice of the primitive European type ? 2 If in Karpathos, for example, the ' Ionic chiton' could last on, within living memory, as the costume of the women, unqualified, it hardly seems impossible that in remoter Crete a costume should have survived, similarly unqualified down to Tournefort's time, and merely coupled with Turkish underwear in Pashley's,3 and our own, which was still, we may suppose, in vogue in the island when the Ionic chiton was still 'the last new thing' in Karpathos; and which had, besides, the advantage of im- memorial antiquity behind it.4 The same argument can be constructed in regard to the fanlike Min6an headdress of Petsofi.: the principal data being the fanlike head- dresses associated with the bodice-and-skirt peasant costumes, from the Tyrol to Brittany and Scandinavia; and in modern Greece the wonderful headgear of the costumes of Corfu and Amorgos.

' Note that in Kalymnos and its modern colonies, and I think also in Kos, the ' Ionic chiton ' or 'night-gown '-type has the Anatolian ' dressing-gown' simply superimposed : and the same combination is shewn more than once in von Hahn's Frontispiece to vol. i. Note to p. 364. In a letter received since this paper was in type, Mr. Dawkins suggests to me that what I have described as a ' loin-cloth' may be a 'Bantu sheath' of the type which is familiar on sculptured and modelled figures of Predynastic style in Egypt.
