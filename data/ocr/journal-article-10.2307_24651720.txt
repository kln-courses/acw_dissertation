<plain_text><page sequence="1">HIP PENDANTS AND CARDIOPHYLAX RIBBONS: TOWARDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DAUNIAN STELAI* Camilla Norman The Daunian stelai form an extraordinary group of monuments that, although well-known in Italy, are often overlooked elsewhere. They are part of a tradition of anthropomorphic stelai in Europe that spans from the Neolithic to the Late Iron Age. Such stelai, in stone, are especially evident in Italy: from Lunigiana, the Val Camonica, the Po Valley, and in Daunia. Further solitary examples suggest that these were not isolated pockets of activity for the production of anthropomorphic stelai, but that in the intervening areas similar models were created in wood, now long gone. The stelai of Iron Age Daunia stand out for their particular intricacy and sheer quantity. It is long overdue that they be brought to greater renown. Within Daunia the stelai occur only north of the Ofanto river (fig. 1). They have been found mainly on the large fertile plain of the Tavoliere with the greatest concentration towards the coast between the Candelaro and Cervaro rivers in Contrada Beccarini, near Siponto. Some fragments have been found as far as Melfi, Lavello, and Banzi.1 Although these three sites are situated in the mountains of modern Basilicata, they had a direct link with the heartland of Daunia via the Ofanto valley and were closely aligned to this region culturally. Today some one and a half thousand fragments of Daunian stelai are known, the vast majority of which are housed in the National Museum of Manfredonia. No close parallels exist outside the area.2 Silvio Ferri was the first scholar to take a serious interest in the Daunian stelai, establishing a programme to gather all pieces together shortly after a fragment was first brought to his attention in the early 1960s.3 The collection was not carried out as rigorously and systematically as one would expect today, but took the form of a general scouring of the countryside with an alert sent out to local farmers. In this manner many fragments were undoubtedly saved from destruction by the deep plough, introduced to southern Italy at approximately that time, but next to no record remains of their provenances or contexts.4 Abbreviations: Nava 1980 M.

Thanks are due also to Ted Robinson for his invaluable advice and input, to Ginevra D'Onofrio for her assistance at the National Museum of Manfredonia, and especially to Maria Luisa Nava for kindly allowing me to work with the Daunian stelai. Part of the research for this paper was carried out while on a grant received from the Australian Foundation for Studies in Italy, without which I would not have had the opportunity to study the stelai in depth. I am grateful for their assistance. Unless otherwise stated, all pieces referred to in this paper are from the National Museum of Manfredonia (FG).

However, with the exception of the few examples from Cavallino in Salento (F. D'Andria, 'Nuovi dati sulle relazione tra Daunia e Messapia', in: Studi in onore di Dinu Adamesteanu [1983] 41-7; F.

Crielaard, 'Greek colonists and indigenous populations at L'Amastuola, southern Italy', BaBesch 82, 2007, 100-1 fig. 38), none show any remarkable similarities to the Daunian stelai. The famous 'Capestrano Warrior', first published by Giuseppe Moretti in II guerriero italico di Capestrano (1936), although an anthropomorphic marker and contemporary, is far removed stylistically. 3 For a complete bibliography of Ferri's work see: D.

Map of Iron Age Daunia showing centres in the find zone of the stelai. Some pieces are said to have been found reused in roads, walls, buildings, and even as a fountain base, the nature of their shape and material being readily adaptable for such purposes. Because the original contexts of the stelai are not known, their exact function remains obscure. That they were intended to stand upright is inferred from the fact that they are decorated on all sides with a substantial area at the base left bare where the slab would have been inserted vertically into the ground. Indeed, there are occasionally practice marks in this zone where the artisan has incised a trial meander knowing that it would later be covered.5 Although the evidence for it is limited, it is commonly held that the stelai were funerary monuments. If so, numbers indicate that not every member of the society was honoured with one. Certainly the man-hours required to produce a stele of such an elaborate nature point to them being intended only for the elite, or a particular sector of the population. The stelai are cut from a single rectangular limestone slab, most probably quarried from the nearby Gargano hills. The slab is incised to show the arms, hands, dress, and accoutrements of a human figure. The heads are either conical in shape and carved directly from the same piece three fragments that are known to have been picked up near Arpi: inv. 812 (SD 623); inv. 941-2 (SD 732); and inv. 808 (SD 618). Another fragmentary stela, Foggia IG 128493, is purported to have been found in a grave from contrada Cupola (F. Tine Bertocchi, 'Formazione della civilta daunia del X al VI secolo A.C.', Atti del Colloquio Internazionale di Preistoria e Protostoria della Daunia [1975] 279-80 pi. 70). In recent decades a small number of new pieces have been found, although never in their original contexts. See for example those from the Melfese published by Tagliente art. cit. and G. Tocco, 'Leonessa', in: D. Adamesteanu et al., Popoli anellenici in Basilicata (1971) 116 pi. 45. For what are said to be the only published fragments discovered under excavation conditions, found reused in the wall of a later tomb, see J. Mertens, Ordona I (1965) 64 pi. 46: I; R. Iker in: J.

The arms of the figure are arranged symmetrically, bent at the elbows with the hands almost meeting in the centre, palms flat against the rib cage. The clothing is typically represented, on both the front and back of the slab, by a border of geometric patterning at the collar, the hem, and down each edge. The sides of the slab itself are sometimes also incised with simple geometric designs. The overall impression given by this patterning is that of an elaborate and carefully made robe. This, in conjunction with the positioning of the arms, has prompted speculation that the figure portrayed is that of the deceased laid out for burial. In the panels created by the geometric borders of the robes fascinating figurative scenes are sometimes portrayed. They come from the ritual, mythological, martial, and domestic spheres and include vignettes of hunting, sailing, warfare, weaving, processions, and farewells. Coming from a society that was not literate and which otherwise produced very little figured art, it is this iconography that has attracted the most attention to the Daunian stelai. Ferri focused on the figurative iconography of individual stelai in his articles, championing the idea that much of it finds its roots in Greek mythology and literature.7 Based on the form of the slab and the accoutrements depicted upon the figure, there are two basic groups into which the stelai can be divided. The first, 'stelai with ornamentation' (pi. 1: 3), are typically shown wearing a necklace, up to three fibulae, gloves (or arm decorations), and an apron slung from a belt. Pendants of various shapes are often strung from the fibulae, a larger and more elaborate one from the lowest fibula. Circular and pomegranate-shaped pendants may also be suspended on long strings from the belt. A small 'tattoo' in the form of a cross, diamond, swastika, or starburst is sometimes visible just above the elbow.8 Stelai with ornamentation have high shoulders, cut three-dimensionally into the slab itself, and occasionally carry a plait, incised or in relief, running down the centre of the back. The second group, 'stelai with weaponry' (pi. 1: 2), have no gloves or jewellery but are instead shown wearing a double-axe-shaped cardiophylax, with a short sword slung at the waist and a large circular shield covering the back. Their shoulders are always flat. There are approximately six times as many stelai with ornamentation as there are stelai with weaponry, and it is for this reason they are termed as such rather than 'female' and 'male'. 6 For only two stelai so far is it possible to make a secure identification of the head to be associated with the body: inv. 0235 (SD 222) and a small, intact stele recently found and now on display in the National Museum of Manfredonia. A few of the earlier stelai excavated from Monte Saraceno, precursors to the Daunian stelai of the Iron Age, have also been found complete or associated with their heads. These stelai are smaller and devoid of incision, e.g. inv 0749-0750 (SD 609). Due to this small sample size our understanding of how head types relate to body types is limited, with conclusions largely based on how the heads correspond to the shape of sockets or neck stubs on the bodies. A common misunderstanding sees the conical head associated with pylos helmets and thus ascribed to the stelai with weaponry. It seems that this is not the case, as shown by inv. 0235 and the new stele, the presence of incised necklaces on many of the conical heads, and the iconographic evidence on the stelai themselves which show females with pointed headgear. Furthermore a number of the spherical heads carry the remains of what are considered to be helmet plumes. 7 In his obituary for Ferri, S. Settis, in StClOr 30. 1980, 12-33. highlights Ferri's pioneering attitude in considering all peoples on their own merits. Settis writes that when Ferri detected Greek characteristics in the material culture of others, be it in Roman copies of Classical sculpture or supposed reflections of Greek mythology on the Daunian stelai, he saw the work not as the debasement of a Greek original, but rather as an interpretation of it prompted by the needs and motivations of the people concerned. Though Ferri well understood the historical and geographical circumstances of the Daunians, his viewpoint towards their culture was conditioned by his own education in the classics. Today it is believed that the stimuli drawn upon by the Daunians were not necessarily Greek but rather came from a cultural koine shared by many in the Mediterranean at the time. If this is taken into account, much of Ferri's work remains valid and there is still a lot to be gained from it. The details of many of his conclusions, however, should be taken with a grain of salt. 8 See E. Herring. 'Body Art and the Daunian Stelai', in: J. B. Wilkens-E. Herring (eds.). Inhabiting Symbols. Symbol and Image in the Ancient Mediterranean (2003) 121-36 for a discussion on the possible symbolism behind these "tattoos'.</page><page sequence="4">12 Camilla Norman Whilst investigating the Daunian stelai, I noticed that the importance of two motifs appears to have been overlooked. Both depict items worn by the main figure represented by the stele. Maria Luisa Nava, who worked on the stelai with Ferri and has a continued interest in them to this day, has at times hinted at these two attributes, but neither has ever been properly discussed in the literature on Daunian stelai.9 The first motif is found on a substantial number of the stelai with ornamentation (Table 1), always on the right hip proper of the figure within the geometric border on either the front or side of the slab.10 It is typically comprised of two concentric circles below four vertical parallel lines, the inner two of which are usually closer together (fig. 2). These lines are closed with a horizontal line at the top, although on occasion the space between the two inner lines is left open (fig 2b, e, h). At the bottom, the four vertical lines either extend all the way to the outer circle beneath (fig. 2a, g) or are closed with a horizontal line. In the latter instances, the two inner lines reach beyond this point to join with the concentric circles below (fig. 2b, e), or a small circle appears at their junction (fig. 2c, d, f). This smaller circle is at times also apparent in the types described above (fig. 2g, h). There are various permutations on this theme but, with a few notable exceptions,11 the motif is in fact quite standardized. The final appearance is that of a ring or disc suspended from a short strap, not unlike a modern 1 9 day medal of the armed forces. In her catalogue, Nava variously refers to the item as a pendaglio a doppio cerchio, a kymbalon, or simply describes it as part of the geometric bordering of the figure's robes without consideration of it as an independent element: ... sotto: cintura e parte super[iore] delle due bande later[ali] vertic[ali] con riquadri a motivi decor[azione] geom|etrica] (triangoli, cerchi concentrici a d[estra] e svastica a sinistral).13 (pi. 2: 2). For three reasons I have resisted following Nava's lead in naming this attribute a 'double circle pendant' and instead propose the term 'hip pendant': first, to avoid the confusion in terminology outlined below; second, because the pendants are sometimes comprised of more than two concentric circles; and third, that they are without fail worn on the right hip, which 9 Much of the research that has been carried out on Daunian stelai is due to Silvio Ferri and Maria Luisa Nava. For a comprehensive list of their publications, see the bibliography provided in Nava 1988, 216-7. The book itself is largely an updated collection, lavishly illustrated, of Ferri's most important works on the stelai, including the fundamental Stele Dannie series published in the Bollettino cl'Arte from 1962 to 1967. Nava's 1980 catalogue gives an excellent overview and contains photographs and a description of each stele fragment in the National Museum of Manfredonia up until 1980. Without the work of these two scholars the Daunian stelai would have remained almost unknown. 10 1 have identified 57 certain instances of the motif, plus a further two possible instances: see Table 1 for details. Those located on the side of the slab should not be confused with the single circle, or single set of concentric circles, that sometimes denotes the belt or hemline. 11 Inv. 190 (SD 182) (fig. 4a), inv. 1435 (SD 1118) (fig. 4b). and Mariemont AC 85/15b all contain six-petal rosettes and, in addition to Mariemont AC 85/15a, hang from a long, single strap with a triple V termination at the upper end; inv. 80 (SD 74) and Budapest b hang from a single strap; Budapest a hangs from a single strap which, along with the outer circle, is decorated with a simple running meander; inv. 387 (SD 362) is comprised of six concentric circles; inv. 689-98 (SD 584) is suspended on a single strap from a boxed swastika; inv. 1175 (SD 918) is comprised of three concentric circles; inv. 1412 (SD 1095) is suspended on a single strap from two concentric squares; and inv. 1578a (unpublished) has a disc with elaborate decoration (fig. 3). 12 In a recent article which appeared after the writing of this article. S. Verger, 'Notes sur les vetements feminins complexes figures sur les steles dauniennes', in; G. Volpe et al. (eds.), Storia e archeologia della Daunia: in ricordo di Marina Mazzei. Atti delle giornate di studio. Foggia, 19-21 maggio 2005 (2008) 120-1 figs 16 and 18, mentions the pendant. He does not believe that the rectangular element represents a strap and considers it instead to be a perforation in the woman's cloak through which a gros pendentif annul aire massif hangs. Verger offers no possible meaning for the pendant, nor what it might reveal about the Daunian stelai. 13 Nava 1980, 81 no. 200.</page><page sequence="5">Hip Pendants and Cardiophylax Ribbons 13 Figure 2.

Furthermore, their relationship, or lack thereof, to the kymbalon must be clarified. A kymbalon, or cymbal, is an instrument used in mystery cults,17 and indeed Ferri suggests an Orphic connection when discussing the iconography of inv. 0953 (SD 742) (pi. 3: 1), known for its so-called human sacrifice scene. In this passage he specifically refers to the single pendant hanging alongside this scene, on the back of the skirt, as a kymbalon.18 Although it is uncommon for a single, asymmetrically positioned skirt pendant to be depicted, the one in question does not differ from a typical skirt pendant. In fact it is almost identical to the two skirt pendants that appear on the front of the same stele. That it is without a partner has more to do with artistic license—the need to make room for the figurative scene—than it is a tribute to Orphism, quite apart from what the scene itself does or does not imply. Cymbals portrayed in ancient imagery, such as those held by Laconian bronze figurines of the 6th century, on a 4th-century volute krater from Spina, and later at Pompeii,20 differ in form from both the skirt and hip pendants. All are of a size large enough to comfortably fill the palm of an open hand and all are unconnected, presumably so that they could be clashed together without restraint. Examples of actual cymbals known from antiquity are rare but again bear little relation to the two types of pendant.21 14 The only hip pendants occurring on the left (on the side of the slab) are those on the Mariemont and Budapest stelai, however these stelai still carry a hip pendant on the right side as well. The only other stele with two hip pendants is SD 384, which carries one on both the right front and right side. L Without passing judgment on the appropriateness of the term kymbcilon, Nava explicitly states that she maintains it in her catalogue to describe the skirt pendant only, with the intention of avoiding confusion between these and the pendants located elsewhere on the stelai (ibid. 15 n. 2). However, this distinction is not always carried through. See. e.g.. ibid. 151 no. 693 pi. 222, where a hip pendant on the side of the slab is called a kymbcilon. 16 S. Ferri-M. L. Nava, Stele Daunie 2 (1983) 17. 17 Cymbals are often carried by maenads: for example, the Great Frieze in the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii and a very similar depiction in the house of M. Lucretius Fronto both show a near naked maenad seen from behind, dancing and playing cymbals. See, e.g., G. Sauron, La grande fresque de la Villa des Mysteres a Pompei (1998) 17. However, there seems also to be a strong association between cymbals and the cult of Cybele. See, e.g., Clement of Alexandria's Protrepticus 2: 23, 30, and 69, the latter of which quotes from Menander's Priestess: 'If a man drags the Deity. Whither he will by the sound of cymbals. He that does this is greater than the Deity; But these are the instruments of audacity and means of living invented by men." A krater from Spina (Ferrara 2897) shows an ecstatic dance in the presence of a divine couple and includes a boy with cymbals. The rite depicted, due to the presence of flutes, cymbals, and snakes, is attributed to the cult of Cybele and Dionysus Sabazius (P. E. Arias, 'La tomba dionisiaca 128 di Valle Trebba a Spina'. RivIstArchStAr. s. III 17. 1994. 8-19 fig. 12). A. Villing, 'For whom did the bell toll in ancient Greece? Archaic and Classical bells at Sparta and beyond'. BSA 97, 2002, 288 n. 250, also points to a connection with Cybele and Attis. but further suggests that 'cymbals ... may have had a role particularly in Artemis' cult, and were sometimes dedicated to dieties, including Spartan Artemis Limnatis, especially by women on the occasion of a woman's marriage (which meant she could no longer participate in the ritual dances she used to partake in as a girl)'. Is S. Ferri-M. L. Nava, Stele Daunie (1975) 8-9. In her catalogue, Nava (1980, 158 no. 742) refers to the same item as a pendciglio a doppio cerchio. ''' Bronze naked female figurines, largely mirror supports, that have been attributed to the cult of Artemis Orthia are sometimes shown holding small cymbals.

Rimmer, Ancient Musical Instruments of Western Asia in the British Museum (1969) pi. 21.</page><page sequence="8">16 Camilla Norman Whilst there is no evidence to suggest that the circular skirt pendants are meant to represent anything other than bronze rings, similar to the personal ornamentation known from contemporary burials at such places as Lavello,22 Alianello,23 Incoronata, and San Teodoro,24 depictions of hip pendants are quite different. Rather than from a long string, the hip pendant hangs from a short and sturdy strap which is often embellished and is in itself a fundamental element of the object. It is always found on the right hip of the figure and, as we shall see, its appearance is restricted to a single phase of the typology. There can be little doubt that the hip pendant was intended to represent a specific and separate item. Its function nonetheless remains obscure. In a rare mention of the hip pendant, Nava and Ferri agree that its meaning is unclear, suggesting it may simply be a decoration hanging from the robes: In alcuni casi, sul fianco destro, all'altezza del gomito, compare un doppio cerchio, pendente da piii linee verticali parallele (cfr. 1007). L'interpretazione di tale figurazione e per il momento incerta: e stata avanzata l'ipotesi che possa trattarsi di una nappa o di un altro ornamento che guarniva [il] vestito.25 One issue concerning the hip pendant which has considerable bearing on its function is whether the circular element is intended to be read as a hollow ring with the often visible central impression being a tool mark,26 or as a solid, rimmed disc with a small central nipple. On further inspection the latter seems more plausible. The inner circle is more often than not approximately half the diameter of the outer circle so that a ring would have to be either flat or made of a relatively thick wire. More compelling, however, is the existence of various examples of the hip pendant which show further elaboration within the inner circle (fig. 3).27 There exists a number of objects known from Early Iron Age burials in southern Italy which are found exclusively in female tombs, consistently at the right hip: the pendaglio a xilofono, or calcofono; the sonagliera, and the so-called composite disc.28 'Composite discs' have the approximate proportions of our hip pendants, being comprised of two complementary elements in bronze: an outer ring and an inner disc which, when placed together, Figure 3.

Tomb 60 from Francavilla Marittima, of a similar date, contains an example of each of these objects plus other items which have also been interpreted as possible percussion instruments (P.

They can be anywhere from 10 to 30 cm in diameter with the inner disc being approximately half the diameter of the outer ring. Interestingly, on one example, apparently found in the vicinity of Chieti (pi. 4: l),29 the inner disc is decorated in a manner not dissimilar from three of the Daunian hip pendants (fig. 4).30 Zancani Montuoro, in her comprehensive paper on the 'composite discs' from Francavilla Marittima,31 mentions that some of the smaller ones are thought to have been pendants. For example, those 'rinvenuti presso il teschio femminile della tomba 13 nella Figure 4. Hip pendants: inv. 190 (SD 182) and inv. 1435 (SD 1118). Scale 1:2. necropoli di Torre di Palma e considerati pendagli, sospesi con una sorta benda ai lati del viso, perche in uno di essi e inserito un filo di bronzo ravvolto ad anello'.32 Because the better-known calcofono is considered to be a percussion instrument, it has been suggested, partly by extension, that the other items, including the 'composite disc', are also instruments. In short, the 'composite disc', in all likelihood a cymbal-like percussion instrument, is found exclusively in Iron Age tombs of native south Italian females (admittedly more so in Calabria and eastern Sicily than Daunia), often at the right hip, and was sometimes suspended like a pendant. Physically, contextually, and chronologically the 'composite disc' has much in common with the hip pendants depicted on Daunian stelai. Ferri's kymbalon then, although attached to the wrong attribute (the skirt pendant), may not have been that far off the mark. The recognition of the hip pendant has numerous implications, the most obvious being that a number of stele fragments can now confidently be classified as stelai with ornamentation.33 Other fragments which were formerly floating can be anchored to a specific area on the stela, namely the right hip. However, in addition to this, the hip pendant is a very useful typological identifier—of all the pieces carrying a hip pendant that have been attributed to types by Nava,34 only two do not belong with her types IV and Va.35 . . 'if. "in Outlined in 1980, and expanded upon more fully in 1988, Nava's typology provides a solid framework for a systematic approach to the stelai. By dividing them into groups based on form, the technique of incision, and the development of the ornamentation and weaponry shown upon them, Nava has been able to suggest a linear progression for the stelai and put forward a credible relative chronology. The typology's only evident flaw is that different centres of production are not taken into account. No doubt regionality played a part,38 but for want of any known provenances, this is not an avenue easily pursued. Both the stelai with ornamentation and those with weaponry fall, according to Nava, into five main groups 29 Zancani Montuoro art. cit. pi. 38b. 30 Inv. 190 (SD 182), inv. 1435 (SD 1118), and Mariemont AC 85/15. It should be noted that the attribution of the hip pendant on inv. 1435 is not certain and that those on inv. 190 and Mariemont AC 85/15 stand out for other reasons also. Not only are they possibly the earliest depictions of the hip pendant (see n. 33) but they are suspended on a longer, single strap. 31 Zancani Montuoro art. cit. 83-92 pi. 7: 36-8. 32 Ibid. 88. 33 See Table 1 for details of reclassified fragments. 34 The assignation of types followed is that published in Nava 1980, 48 with updated information taken from Nava 1988. 35 Inv. 441 (SD 409) is type II and inv. 190 (SD 182) is type III. Mariemont AC 85/15, which carries a hip pendant almost identical to that on inv. 190, would also fall into Nava's type III. All these hip pendants are not of the standard form. That on inv. 441 is, in addition, a questionable identification. 36 Nava 1980, 14-30. 37 Nava 1988, 180-98. 38 It is thought by Nava (ibid. 187) that it is possible to detect various 'hands' and 'workshops' for the Daunian stelai, a belief with which I strongly concur.</page><page sequence="10">18 Camilla Norman (I to V), with a transitional group II/III and group V subdivided into a, b, and c. Without context, the dating of these groups is extremely difficult and has been based largely on how the objects depicted on the stelai relate to their actual counterparts in the material record. Of particular use are the fibulae, the fibula pendants, and the swords. Because the depictions are highly stylized, this is problematic, and precision is not possible. For additional information Nava also drew comparisons between the geometric patterning on the stelai and that seen on the contemporary Daunian matt-painted pottery, the absolute chronology of which is somewhat more secure. Nava has thus placed groups I to III of the stelai in the late 7th to mid-6th centuries bc and groups IV and V, which she sees as possibly contemporaneous, in the latter half of the 6th century, making the entire corpus parallel to the perceived rise and subsequent degradation of Daunian ceramics. Following Nava's typology, the hip pendant, being found on only type IV and Va stelai, would have been adopted by the Daunians sometime around the mid-6th century BC. If our interpretation of the hip pendant as a percussion instrument were to be proven correct, its occurrence during such a limited period of time 39 would raise some interesting questions with regard to its function and whether it might be related to the introduction of a new cult, or the relaxation of secrecy surrounding an existing one. F. Salomone has proposed an alternative typology based not only on morphological and technical aspects and the type of ornamentation depicted, but also taking into consideration the figurative scenes used, as well as the combinations and spatial distribution of all incised elements across the face of the stelai.40 Patterns concerning the secondary iconography are thus treated as integral to the development of the typology, rather than as a by-product of it. Salomone's typology is defined by three individual figurative 'systems', the third divided into five sub-groups, and each with five internal 'grades' (the last grade corresponding to the stelai with weaponry of each system). Rather than reflecting the evolution of new styles over time,41 Salomone's systems are based on regional variation. The idea has merit, but the final construct is somewhat ungainly and until the typology has been better refined it is not an easy tool to work with. That said, the stelai carrying hip pendants fall almost exclusively into Salomone's system 1. Systems 1 and 2 cover the bulk of the corpus and although it is not explicitly stated, should presumably be thought to have come from the Sipontine plain. Irrespective of the typology followed, it is clear that the hip pendant is associated with a particular group of stelai with ornamentation. These stelai were either made within a specific timeframe or in the same locality, or both. The really interesting questions are: to whom were they dedicated or whom were they intended to commemorate, and just what was the significance of the hip pendant to this group?—questions that unfortunately we are not yet in a position to answer. The second overlooked motif is found on the stelai with weaponry (Table 2) and is directly associated with the cardiophylax. Unlike the round heart protector depicted on the Capestrano Warrior in the Museum of Chieti, the double-axe-shaped cardiophylakes of the Daunian stelai are not well represented in the material record. The few examples we have in bronze are too thin to have been of any real practical use,42 but holes around the edges of 39 Most composite discs have been dated to the 8th cent ury bc, some two centuries earlier. 411 A.

Salomone gives no corresponding chronology for his typology but does note that 'le strutture in cui alcuni frammenti sono stati reimpiegati forniscono solo un terminus ante quern intorno alia meta del VI a. C." (ibid. 315 n. 94). thus indicating a higher chronology than that proposed by Nava. 1 One double-axe-shaped cardiophytcix has been found in the vicinity of Bovino (Nava 1988, 196-7 fig. 219) and two from Lavello, now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale del Vulture e Melfese (A.

Not to scale. these cardiophylakes show that they were probably attached to a heavy cloth or leather which would have afforded not only further protection but a means of strapping them to the body.43 On the stelai with weaponry a solid section, usually adorned with a series of small circles, can often be seen both above and below the cardiophylax, giving the impression of just such an ensemble (pi. 4: 2; fig. 5). Presumably the circles represent rivets used in its making and/or for extra protection, as can sometimes be seen on the shields of the stelai with weaponry. Our new motif is in the form of elongated rectangles, found always in a pair, which extend from the base of this adjunct and trail below the sword (fig. 7).44The rectangles vary in both length and width. Some are left plain and are simply squared off at the bottom (fig. 7c) whilst others are decorated with concentric circles and may be terminated with a fringe or tassel (fig. 7a, b). For want of a better name I have called them 'cardiophylax ribbons'. It is rare that they are not present on the stelai with weaponry.45 Cardiophylax ribbons, although decorative, were also functional: they helped to hold the sword sheath in place. The nicest illustration of this is found on a fragmentary stela, inv. 828, 971, 1260 (SD 637) (fig. 6), where each ribbon carries a 'rivet' snugly situated either side of the sword with the ribbons themselves drawn across it, as if wrapped around the sword sheath to keep it steady. Such an arrangement is clearly visible on the Capestrano Warrior, where two fine straps connect the sword sheath to the base of the cardiophylax,46 Here they are purely functional and do not hang below the sword. It is not surprising that we find no trace of the cardiophylax ribbons in the archaeological record as they were no doubt made of a perishable material. 43 Bottini ibid. 46 believes that this is not the case for the two cardiophylakes from Lavello, and that 'la diretta sovrapposizione delle due lamine metalliche fa escludere la presenza intermedia di un'imbottitura in materia organica'. 44 On one curious unpublished stele in the Museo Nazionale di Manfredonia the cardiophylax ribbons are present in place of the cardiophylax. The stele has evidently been reworked after suffering a break, so too much should not be read into this. See Table 2, Manfredonia unpublished 1. 45 There are only three examples that I am aware of: inv. 452 (SD 417), inv. 972-974 (SD 748), and possibly inv. 1259 (SD 984). Inv. 452 is unusual in that it is also missing the sword and robes on the front. Whilst it is not uncommon for the front of a stelai with weaponry to be devoid of the geometric patterning down the edges, there is usually a single line incised in its place. More astonishing is that, although there is no sword, the square tip of the sheath is present—it would seem that the stele is unfinished. The cardiophylax ribbons, which logically would have been drawn after the sword, were probably still to be added. 46 R. Bianchi Bandinelli-A.

Dimensions in brackets are incomplete. Notes: (a) The classification of this fragment as stele with weaponry is uncertain. It rests solely upon the identification of the cardiophylax ribbons which, given the small size of the fragment, is speculative, (b) Nava 1988, fig. 215. (c) Nava 1988, fig. 210. (d) J.

Looking at the cardiophylax ribbons in relation to Nava's typology, a clear pattern emerges. Nothing reliable can be said for the ribbons of the type I stelai as there is only one example,47 nor for the ribbons of the type V stelai as no relevant fragments survive. Where it can be seen, all type II stelai have the cardiophylax adjunct extending to the sword and covered with concentric circles. The ribbons tend to be short and of medium width, terminating with a fringe or tassel, and are often decorated with concentric circles (fig. 7a, b). The ribbons on type II/III (fig. 7c) and III (fig. 7d) stelai are most often thin, undecorated, and of medium length. These configurations are exclusive and predominant to their type, but there does exist a certain amount of variation. The cardiophylax ribbons on type IV stelai, however, are rigorously uniform. They are thick and long, sometimes reaching right 47 Inv. 1411 (SD 1904). 48 An exception to this rule is the stele from a private collection in Bari, Nava 1988. 195-6 fig. 215-6. It has more in common with another large unpublished stele in the magazines of the National Museum of Manfredonia than the rest of the type IV weaponry stelai. These two stelai, along with a stele with ornamentation once in a private collection in Trani and now in Manfredonia (ibid. 194-5 figs. 212-3) are in my opinion later, or more probably regional, examples and fall outside the current typology.</page><page sequence="13">Hip Pendants and Cardiophylax Ribbons 21 \t—if _J~M Trnn Figure 7.

There are three fragments with cardiophylax ribbons of this type that, on the basis of other attributes, are undoubtedly stelai with weaponry,49 allowing a further five fragments with ribbons of the same type to be classified as such.50 All five of these fragments are of a substantial size and carry figurative iconography. This iconography is often quite enigmatic and includes the famous fishing boat scene (pi. 4: 3). It is invaluable that through the identification of the cardiophylax ribbons we can now confidently say these images are all associated with the stelai with weaponry and their realm. The importance of the 'hip pendant' and 'cardiophylax ribbons' is twofold. Firstly they provide fresh information on the dress and armour of the Daunians otherwise not present in the material record. On the stelai with ornamentation we may even be seeing a ritual item that has not previously been noted in Daunia which, because it can be tied to a specific time frame, may prove to be informative regarding the development of religious practices on the Tavoliere. Secondly, the two newly identified attributes are indicators which can establish the class and type of stele fragments, which in turn aids in the detection of possible joins or associated fragments. Immediately the figurative iconography on certain fragments that can now be conclusively classified is also given context, being located in the ambit of either stelai with ornamentation or weaponry. The importance of placing individual fragments within the corpus cannot be overstated. Without the luxury of provenances or contexts for the stelai, it is only by looking at the body of works as a whole that there can be any hope of uncovering their precise function and answering the many questions concerning their social, religious, and eschatological significance.51 At a time when others in Italy were doing so, the Daunians did not typically decorate their ceramics with figurative scenes, nor their architecture, and did not take up writing. The stelai are the only form of narrative expression left to us by them and at present offer the best evidence for exploring the larger questions and for fleshing out the picture we have of their society. Based on such remains as their domestic, civic, and burial 49 Inv. 95 (SD 89), inv. 100 (SD 94), and inv. 169 (SD 160) which is only preserved below the sword but carries part of the shield on the back. The stele in Geneva (see Table 2) could also be added to this list. 50 Inv. 802 (SD 612), inv. 814 (SD 624), inv. 815 (SD 625), inv. 950-1 (SD 737), and inv. 1012 (SD 780). Inv. 802 was later identified as a stele with weaponry by Nava in the caption to Ferri's article Stele Daunie VI republished in Nava 1988, 88 fig. 114. It carries a tiny sliver of the bottom of a shield at the break, almost too small for a comfortable classification, so the cardiophylax ribbons are ideal for confirmation. 51 The ability to 'sex' further fragments will allow us to investigate the discrepancy in numbers between the stelai with ornamentation and the stelai with weaponry, a core issue which, once solved, will no doubt reveal key information on the function and meaning of the Daunian stelai.</page><page sequence="14">22 Camilla Norman architecture, and the distribution of their ceramics, our image of the Daunians is currently rather sketchy.
