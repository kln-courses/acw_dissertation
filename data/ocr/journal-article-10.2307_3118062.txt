<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bitter Fruit: The Politics of Black-Korean Conflict in New York City. By Claire Jean Kim. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2000. 300p. $37.50. Richard M. Merelman, The University of Wisconsin-Madison In this case study of the 1990 Red Apple Boycott of two Korean-owned produce stores in Brooklyn, New York, Claire Kim narrates a complex story of resurgent Black Na- tionalism, the rise of Korean resistance to blacks, and the fateful temporizing of Mayor David Dinkins, whose belated crossing of the boycott picket lines deeply injured his may- oralty. Kim has high ambitions in telling this story; she wishes to use it to displace a flawed "racial scapegoating" theory of black-Korean relations and to advance in its stead her own theory of "racial ordering" in the United States. Kim's narrative of the Red Apple Boycott is more effective than is her theoretical analysis. While she offers an engrossing study of racial politics in New York City, her larger theory does not persuasively explain the events she describes. Kim's 69 interviews, her extensive analysis of pri- mary sources, her depiction of media coverage, and her sociodemographic data support her contention that the Red Apple Boycott was indeed an episode of resurgent Black Nationalism. Kim effectively connects the boycott to Black Nationalist activism during the Koch administration and black reactions to white racist attacks in Howard Beach and Bensonhurst. She demonstrates that well-known Black 424</page><page sequence="2">American Political Science Review Vol. 96, No. 2 Nationalist leaders quickly took over the leadership of the boycott, which emerged after an altercation between a Ko- rean store owner and a Haitian woman customer. The leaders of the boycott did indeed intend their action to further Black Nationalist goals. Moreover, the boycott was part of a long tradition of Black Nationalist politics in New York City. That the boycott persisted for eight months sustains Kim's argu- ment that previous Black Nationalist efforts had effectively prepared the black population for sustained political action. Nevertheless, Kim does not quite achieve her goal of es- tablishing that the Red Apple Boycott was an example of "purposive, collective action" (p. 3). Kim argues that the boycotters aimed to "punish the offending merchants, to defy and disrupt the power structure, to bring Black immigrants under the Black Power umbrella, and to raise Black people's consciousness about racial oppression in America" (p. 125). But these purposes emerged at different moments, and of- ten appear as much to be rationalizations after the fact as established goals prior to the events. True, the boycott did harm the offending merchants (but not other Korean shop- keepers); however, its clumsy elevation of African Americans over immigrant Haitians seems unlikely to have extended Black Power to these immigrants. Nor did the boycott disrupt "the power structure," since, if Kim is correct, Koreans are not part of the power structure. Nor could it have raised black people's consciousness of racial oppression in America, since most American blacks probably knew nothing of it, and those in New York City hardly needed a boycott to confirm their consciousness of racial grievance. And what, as a case of purposive collective action, did the boycott actually accomplish? Little good. The boycott alien- ated Koreans, who for the first time engaged in serious polit- ical countermobilization. The boycott helped bring down the first elected black mayor in New York City, David Dinkins, whose departure elevated to power the hostile Rudolph Giulani and his police-friendly policies, which specifically tar- geted blacks. And the boycott further diminished the already reduced stores of Jewish liberalism in New York City politics. Of course, these facts don't demonstrate that the boycotters were not engaged in purposive collective action; however, they do make us question the rationality of these actions. Need the boycott have faltered? Kim implies so; she states that "racial power cleans up after itself. It inevitably generates protest by subordinated groups, but it also names, interprets, and ultimately silences that protest" (p. 219). Kim draws this conclusion largely because of the theory of racial power she advances as antidote to a flawed theory of racial scapegoat- ing, which marginalizes episodes of black-Korean conflict as irrational, decontextualized, emotional outbursts. In con- trast, Kim asserts that a distinct structure of racial power in the United States consistently "racializes" new immigrant groups, orders racial minorities hierarchically, and utilizes such devices as "color-blind" language, myth (i.e., Koreans as a "model minority," blacks as an "underclass"), political exclusion, economic stratification, spatial segregation, and media bias to contain the inevitable episodes of conflict that racial ordering spawns. Within this order Koreans are a "tri- angulated" group; they possess a favored cultural position as a model minority, and they enjoy relative economic success, but they are permanently foreign and "unassimilable" (p. 45). As the failure of the Red Apple Boycott demonstrates, this racial order effectively resists disruption. Although Kim's theory has virtues, it suffers from inac- curacies, nonfalsifiable propositions, exaggerations, anthro- pomorphism, and, most important, a gap between structure and agency. Kim inaccurately argues that the racial order "excludes Asian Americans from civic membership" (p. 16). This is historically false and, worse, denies to the Koreans in her story their own repeated avowals of American civic na- tionalism. Perhaps such statements are part of the false con- sciousness bred by color-blind language, but the concept of color-blind language is itself problematic, for it makes Kim's theory nonfalsifiable. If color-blind language is, like explicitly racial language, a part of racial power, there is no empirical condition that could disconfirm Kim's theory of racialization. Also, Kim consistently exaggerates her arguments; for exam- ple, she repeatedly refers to unfavorable media coverage of the boycotts as the "official line" (p. 193ff), though she never identifies any "officials" who direct this coverage. Most important, the theory of racial power produces a kind of anthropomorphic determinism that simply doesn't account for actors' interpretations of events. "Racial power" is a gen- eral structural concept, which operates only through the ac- tions of real people. It is too far from Kim's structural theory to Sonny Carson's (a Black Nationalist leader) explanation of the boycott ("the reason for the boycott was that a Black woman was slapped" [p. 124]). Nothing in the theory accounts for either the slap or the reaction to it; moreover, little that is resonant of the theory surfaces in actors' statements of their own motives. A satisfying theory of racial politics must connect structure to agency more closely than does Kim's theory of racial order.</page></plain_text>
