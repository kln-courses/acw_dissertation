By contrast, in the early twentieth century, humanistic scholars understood early Chinese intellectuals to be nontheistic. Those who did not universalize these Western understandings and understood China to have always been polytheistic had lesser influence on religious studies. Kelly Clark and Justin Winslett seek to prove that early China was not atheistic, and to that end, I am sympathetic. I have argued, for example, that those lines in the Analects of Confucius taken to indicate agnosticism were mistranslated. Nonetheless, I take exception to the underlying premise of these authors which posits a Hebrew Bible-type deity at the core of early Chinese religion.

The authors criticize sinologists (Chiin-fang Yu, Jacques Gernet, and Marcel Granet) who correctly point out that, in the main, early Chinese deities are not transcendent and are imminent (929). The authors further assume that the new cognitive approaches to religion demand an understanding of a singular anthropomorphic deity (933), and refer to two major scholars of early Chinese religion (David Keightly and Robert Eno) as supporting their view, when these scholars view Chinese theism quite differently (934). It is one thing to find superior numinous entities in early Chinese civilization, but it is something else to assume that they must necessa rily fit the model of conservative Christian theology, with a focus on a male deity with human behavioral traits of rewarding and punishing. This problem is inherent in Christian missionary translations into Chinese. From the late sixteenth century, Jesuit missionaries noted that the emperor made offerings to Tiandi (Sky-Earth) as an imperial preroga tive but understood the term to mean "Heaven and earth." They sepa rated the two elements of the compound, creating the term Tianzhu (Ruler of Heaven) as a translation for God and criticized the Chinese for making offerings to the female Earth aspect of Tiandi. When Protestant missionaries arrived, they would not use the Catholic transla tion for God and instead chose the earliest term for a superior numi nous entity, Shangdi. Robert Eno has pointed out that Shangdi most likely means the aggregate of the ruling clan's dead spirits to which offerings were made. A subsequent dynasty replaced "Shangdi" with UrrI • » Tian. Tian primarily means "sky" and all that pertains to sky. Chinese cosmology posits an ever-ongoing self-creation: from Nothingness arises a Somethingness, arbitrarily called Dao. Dao bifurcates in dual modes: the male-female pair Sky-Earth and the female-male pair Yin Yang. From these fecund pairs come all that naturally exists, the former providing form and the latter life-force. But religious rituals were not primarily directed to these entities but focus on the family—past, present, and future. The primary religious ritual is the feeding of family and clan dead. Only the ruling clan made offerings to Tian in its secon dary meaning as the aggregate of the deceased royal spirits, and to Sky Earth, the progenitors of everything. This misunderstanding of Chinese religion in part is due to circular logic. Western theorists read the Christian use of the terms Shangdi and</page><page sequence="3">520 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Tian back into the Chinese past, and these early terms were accordingly understood as referring to a Western notion of deity rather than the Chinese one. Thus, perhaps inadvertently, the authors of the article assume that where the terms are found in early Chinese texts, their meaning is of the Hebrew Bible deity. They seek to prove that the Chinese "High Deities" are "Punishers and Rewarders" through statisti cal tables of assumed rewards and punishments. The authors use trans lations that follow the anthropomorphic understanding, especially those of the nineteenth-century Christian missionary James Legge, an excel lent translator save for theological terms. Exacerbating the problem are the linguistic differences between Chinese and European languages. Chinese is uninflected; words do not connote gender, number, or time. To do so requires secondary modify ing words when relevant. Indo-European languages among others require specifying gender. Hence, although not specified in Chinese, translations regarding deity specify masculine gender. Thus, nonanthro pomorphic entities are rendered anthropomorphic by the addition of gender. But if Shangdi and Tian are not anthropomorphic deities, then they cannot exhibit human traits. It is not just in early China that deity is not presumed to be anthropomorphic (numerous anthropomorphic deities develop later), it will be found in virtually all of the writings of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim mystics and many nonmystic theolo gians. For example, in the treatise of a major medieval Jewish theolo gian, Saadia Gaon (882-942), God is incorporeal and possesses no anthropomorphic traits: As for those who do not seek to affirm that God is a body but yet insist on arrogating for Him motion or rest or anger or good will or the like, they really arrogate for Him a corporeal character by way of implication, even if they do not do it expressly. (Saadia Gaon 1948:93) Likewise, if these early Chinese numinous entities are not anthropomor phic then we must understand what are assumed to be punishments and rewards differently. For example, the early concept of tianming, which the authors assume to involve reward and punishment, is commonly translated as the "Mandate [or Decree] of Heaven." But ming does not necessarily mean "command," it can also mean "fate" and "pattern." Thus, the term can be understood as "Sky-pattern," relevant to astrology-astronomy (a department in traditional Chinese government). The earliest Chinese writings are prognosis texts. Similarly, the earliest Chinese book, the Yi</page><page sequence="4">Paper: The Evolutionary Psychology of Chinese Religion 521 (Changes) is a divination manual. Its purpose is to indicate the way things are naturally going in order to plan accordingly to achieve success. In this wise, tianming means that a clan head who rules prop erly may end up as king, while one who is a king can lose the reign by acting improperly. Fate is influenced by efficacious, suitable, and moral actions. Other compounds with tian can be similarly analyzed. Thus, some of the examples provided of punishments and rewards can be interpreted as difficulties or advantages arising from not ruling or ruling in accord with the way of the world. These fortunes can be influenced by Shangdi and Tian as the amalgamation of ancestral spirits. Either can be questioned to ascertain the direction of the world through pyroscapulamancy and the manipulation of milfoil stalks, and the pattern of the stars and planets in the sky can be observed. Given these understandings, deity is neither "supernatural" nor "transcen dent." For the ancestral spirits are dead human beings and Sky, along with Earth, are natural entities from which all other natural entities, including humans, are created. Sky is the actual sky, not the Christian Heaven (there are as well a host of lesser nature deities: particular mountains, waters, farmland, trees, rocks, etc.). Clark and Winslett seek to justify the assertion that early China, as all human cultures, understood a transcendent anthropomorphic divine agency to render rewards and punishments. Such a view could be understood as an ethnocentric imposition, not necessarily consciously, of the authors' own religion (Clark is a Protestant theologian) on a non-Western religion. Ethnocentrism has been a continual problem in the comparative study of religion, particularly with regard to compara tive theology. REFERENCE Saadia Gaon 1948 The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, trans.

Winslett* IN OUR ARTICLE, we argued that, contrary to widely held views, many ancient Chinese texts represent high deities as superknowers and as rewarders and punishers. These high deities are represented as agents with a will and not, as many claim, natural forces.1 We drew upon the current work in the cognitive science of religion (CSR) which contends that humans have a natural tendency to believe in anthropomorphic, disembodied spirits and that successful human groups would have culti vated belief in high deities as superknowers who exercise moral provi dence (punishing the wicked and rewarding the righteous). CSR, like much of cognitive science, holds that since humans have roughly similar cognitive faculties and face roughly similar environmental chal lenges, we should expect to find roughly similar beliefs among humans. CSR suggests that we should find ancient Chinese culture roughly similar to, say, ancient Babylonian, Greek, or Indian cultures, which had various forms of high deities that exercised moral providence. Our statistical analysis of twenty-five pre-Qin texts afforded compelling support for this hypothesis. The problem with our article, according to Jordan Paper, is that we assume "a Hebrew Bible-type deity at the core of early Chinese religion."

Paper's suspicions run deeper: he claims that we assume that these superior numinous entities "must necessarily fit the model of conservative Christian theology."2 Paper has read a great deal into our text. We do not cite, as he claims, David Keightly and Robert Eno as supportive of our views. Of Keightly, we write only that he claims Di is superior to other disembod ied spirits, where such superiority is associated with socio-political power. And of Eno, we write only that he concurs with Keightly but that he also believes that Di is associated with father. We do not claim that Keightly and Eno hold more than these views, let alone our views. Nor do we claim that these numinous entities are the same as those found in the Hebrew Bible or in Christian theology, conservative or otherwise. Likewise, we do not claim their similarity to Baal or Vishnu (although they are similar). Consider Paper's paragraph beginning "Tian primarily means 'sky' and all that pertains to sky." Tian primarily does mean "sky." But it can also mean, according to Fung Yulan, China's greatest philosopher of the twentieth century, a Supreme, anthropomorphic Heavenly ruler. More grievous is Paper's claim about Chinese cosmology. While all of our claims are relativized to texts, Paper's claim is textless. He speaks of the ancient Chinese as though they were a single, unified people and that they held to a single, unified philosophy. Hear the Chinese philosophy held by the Chinese people: "Chinese cosmology posits an ever-ongoing self-creation: from Nothingness arises a Somethingness, arbitrarily called Dao. ..." A few pre-Qin texts, usually not unambiguously, repre sent such views. But most of them are silent about such views. However, most of them are not silent about Di, Shangdi, or Tian as superknowers who exercise moral providence. The crux of Paper's criticism asserts our incompetence (not to put too fine a point on it): that using circular logic, we are reading our own Christian conceptions of divinity back into the texts and then using bad translations by Christian missionaries (Legge's) to confirm our Christian assumptions.3 Paper's claim here considers not a single text that we cite or discuss, nor our methodology. He is just sure that we 2We suspect his deepest criticism is something like: "The authors are Christians with missionary motives; enough said." However, since ad hominems are not prized in academic journals, he has offered an argument instead. 3Legge's translation does not prominently feature in our analysis. We relied mostly on our own translation and analyses of texts. Moreover, since Paper makes claims to our linguistic incompetence, one author teaches Chinese at Oxford University.</page><page sequence="7">524 Journal of the American Academy of Religion used circular logic. But we did not conduct a search in English of Legge's translations. We did a database search of original texts. CSR directed our attention to ask various questions of the texts about repre sentations of the high deities. Finding over six hundred such passages at the intersection of high-deity/superknower/rewarder-and-punisher amply vindicates our claim. We will soon put all of our results online for people to decide for themselves. Some quick notes on anthropomorphic language and transcendence. Of course, Chinese terms are not gendered. But our case for anthropo morphism is not based on old, Legge, gendered translations. Paper claims this as a basis for our misunderstanding, but he cites not a single passage where we make this claim. We inferred anthropomorphism from the countless ascriptions of will, belief, emotion, etc. to Di, Shangdi, and Tian. One might also think that understanding Di, Shangdi, and Tian in terms of government leaders, deceased ancestors, and fathers was, well, anthropomorphic. The burden of proof, then, is on the one who denies anthropomorphism. Paper, however, fails to take up this burden, and so considers not a single text that we discussed or argument that we made. By admitting of a superior numinous entity in ancient China, Paper con cedes transcendence. Deities in ancient China are represented as superior (they occasionally stand in authority over and exercise superhuman powers over humans) and numinous (as disembodied spirits they tran scend both bodies and human understanding). That is sufficient for tran scendence. They could, of course, be transcendent in more and other ways. But Paper's admissions are sufficient for transcendence. We are not the only ones using CSR to rethink claims about ancient Chinese texts. Many scholars have claimed that the Chinese, unlike most other ancient cultures, were not dualists about persons. Cognitive scientists, however, argue that we should expect to find folk dualism in every culture. Edward Slingerland and Maciej Chudek offer a masterful statis tical analysis of the pre-Qin corpus that supports the claim of wide spread folk dualism in ancient China.4 People who have been repeating the antidualist mantra for fifty years will, no doubt, find this disconcert ing. Perhaps some will accuse them of circular logic, imposing Western even Christian notions on the texts. But cognitive science, along with the discovery and translation of more and more texts, will lead to a dramatic new understanding of ancient Chinese texts. 4"The Prevalence of Folk Dualism in Early China," Cognitive Science 35: 997-1007 (Summer 2011).</page></plain_text>
