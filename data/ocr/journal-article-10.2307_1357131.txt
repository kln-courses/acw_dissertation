<plain_text><page sequence="1">1996 BOOK REVIEWS 93 No Graven Image? Israelite Aniconism in Its Ancient Near Eastern Context, by Tryggve N. D. Mettinger. Coniectanea Biblica, Old Testament Series 42. Stockholm: Almquist and Wiksel/ International, 1995. 250 pp., 75 line-drawings. Tryggve Mettinger, professor of Old Testament at Lund, and one of Europe's leading biblical scholars, has dealt previously with aniconism in ancient Israel. He pre- sented papers on this subject at international symposia in Tokyo in 1978 and Bern in 1993, where I first came to know him and to appreciate his uncommonly keen interest in archaeology. Now he has produced a full-scale treat- ment that will be required reading for all biblical scholars and Syro-Palestinian archaeologists. As Mettinger justifies his task, "so far no systematic efforts have been made to place Israelite aniconism in a comparative perspective and look for similar development in the other cultures of the ancient Near East" (p. 36). Chapter 1 (pp. 13-38) provides an introductory discus- sion of aims and methods, with a survey of the socio- anthropological literature that is all too rare among textual scholars. The discussion includes a two-fold definition of "aniconism tendencies" in terms of "material aniconism" and "empty-space aniconism" (p. 19). For Mettinger, the only textual and archaeological evidence for the former in ancient Israel is found in the widespread phenomenon of massebot, or standing stones. He further specifies "im- ages" as consisting of representations of deities, whether anthropomorphic or not; and votaries, or representations of worshippers (following Colin Renfrew and others). But he insists then that "images" in his discussion will refer to "iconic representations of the deity." Finally, he stresses that, for him, "Israelite aniconism by no means excludes iconography" (p. 27), adopting the view of Sylvia Schroer (1994) that the ancient Israelites did cultivate a pictorial art in general.1 There follow well-documented comparative chapters on Mesopotamia (Chapter 2, pp. 39-56); the Nabateans (Chapter 3, pp. 57-68); pre-Islamic Arabic (Chapter 4, pp. 69-79); the Phoenician-Punic world (Chapter 5, pp. 81-113); and Syria-Anatolia in the Bronze Age (Chapter 6, pp. 115-34). Chapter 7 (pp. 135-97) surveys both the textual and the archaeological data regarding aniconism in ancient Is- rael. Mettinger's citation of the archaeological data is remarkably thorough and sophisticated for a nonspecial- ist, particularly his use of Uzzi Avner's astonishing but largely ignored evidence of a long tradition of early West Semitic massaba cults in the Negev-Sinai. Mettinger also discusses in passing the terra cotta "Asherah" figurines (as I prefer to call them); cultic stands; altars; bdmat or "high places"; and sanctuaries and their furnishings in general. The massebat, however, are Mettinger's main focus; and here his work goes well beyond all previous studies, pre- cisely because of its thorough grounding in comparative religion and anthropological theory, as well as its full cita- tion of more recent archaeological discoveries. His basic conclusion is that in early Israel missebot were tolerated even in the official cult, but that these simple standing stones cannot be considered truly iconic since they are not anthropomorphic. Later, partly under the influence of Phoenician aniconism, monarchical Israel took up the tradition of "empty-space aniconism," as witnessed, for instance, in the inner sanctum of the Solomonic temple where the typical Canaanite-Phoenician lion throne was vacant. In Mettinger's view, this is borne out by Keel and Uehlinger's proposal (1992: see esp. nn. 1, 3) that anthro- pomorphism in pictorial art generally declines in the later Iron Age. It would accord, of course, with Bernard Lang's incipient monotheistic "Yahweh-alone" movement, begin- ning with the eighth century B.C. prophets. Commenting as an archaeologist who has worked exten- sively with material remains of the Israelite and earlier cults, I would note that Mettinger's extensive use of the archaeo- logical data is refreshing and generally sound. The only shortcoming here is perhaps due to a somewhat conven- tional theological presupposition, namely that the later, Deuteronomistic literary portrait of "Israelite religion" re- flects the reality during the Monarchy. That view, however, has been called into question by dozens of studies during the past decade or so (see, for example, Dever 1995; Dietrich and Klopfenstein 1994; Albertz 1994). In the literary tradi- tion, aniconic monotheistic Yahwism is indeed presented as the norm. But current reconstructions of the prevailing "folk religion" have helped us to appreciate nonconformist cults that no doubt had wide appeal. And here there is, I think, a growing corpus of significant archaeological data that in- dicate that pictorial representations of the deity (or deities) were common-if not of Yahweh, then of Asherah, possibly his consort; and if not anthropomorphic, then iconographic. I am thinking, for instance, of the following as "icons" of sorts: (1) the bronze bull at A. Mazar's 12th century B.C. "Bull Site," probably representing El; (2) the quadruped bearing a winged sun-disc on his back and the nude female holding lions by the ears on the tenth century B.C. Tacanach stand, probably Bacal and Asherah; (3) the enthroned fe- male deity on one of the eighth century B.C. Kuntillet CAj- rfid pithoi, probably Asherah; (4) the numerous eighth- and seventh-century B.C. terra cotta horse-and-rider figurines, perhaps associated with solar deities hinted at in many bib- lical texts (cf. II Kgs 23P: 11-12); (5) the similarly dated seals, many hundreds of which are known, depicting solar and astral deities that were no doubt imported from Assyria and Babylonia into Judah; and (6) especially the thousands of Iron II nude female figurines, which an increasing number of scholars now identify with Asherah, who we now know was widely venerated throughout the Israelite monarchy (Dever 1995; Dietrich and Klopfenstein 1994; Albertz 1994 and references in all three publications).</page><page sequence="2">94 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 302 Mettinger, in surveying some of this evidence, espe- cially at Tacanach, remarks on the "low degree of tension between iconic and aniconic worship" (p. 164). I would suggest that in "folk religion"-the truly normative cult, if numbers count-there was little if any such tension, and some iconic representation of the deities was always taken for granted. Certainly Asherah could be portrayed icono- graphically, even in the "official" cult. Thus I would argue that in the ancient Near East, Israel was different ("not "unique," as a former generation held) in only one regard: there was a near-universal reluctance to portray the male deity Yahweh explicitly and anthropomorphologically. It is still the case that despite the discovery of thousands of figurines representing female deities, we still have no in- disputable examples of male figurines from clear Israelite contests. That is a significant datum; and, although not stressed by Mettinger, it goes far to support his general thesis that his "aniconistic tendencies" were a distinguish- ing, if not exclusive, characteristic of ancient Israel. Mettinger's No Graven Images? is a fundamental and stimulating contribution to the long-overdue dialogue be- tween biblical scholars and Syro-Palestinian archaeolo- gists. A sophisticated, well documented, tightly focused study on some of the basic aspects of the ancient Israelite cult, it augurs well for the future of the discussion. William G.
