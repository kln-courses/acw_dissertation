<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IDEA OF NATIONAL INTEREST* M. S. RAJAN The idea of national interest is a natural corollary to the sovereign-nation-state system, and consequently it is a much dis- cussed conception in the history of political theory. With the organi- sation of the League of Nations in the 1920s and more recently the United Nations, tremendous strides have been made in the growth of the international society. As a result, the idea of national interest ought to have lost its importance. In fact, however, its importance has come to be enhanced, paradoxical though it may seem, indicating thereby that international society is yet to achieve political and moral maturity. Thus, for instance, while in the League Covenant the Domestic Jurisdiction conception, embodied in Art. 15 (8), was ap- plicable only to the settlement of international disputes, Art. 2 (7) of the U.N. Charter which embodies this conception is a limitation on the entire gamut of the activities of the U.N- The importance of the idea of national interest is underlined by the fact that a con- troversy has now been raging for sometime among American poli- tical scientists over the exact content of the idea with reference to the foreign policy of the United States - the country which, per- haps, carries to-day the greatest burden of responsiblity in inter- national affairs. In the past, men of action as well as scholars have made cer- tain categorical statements on this subject. Machiavelli's ideas re- garding the end of the state are too well-known to need any elabo- ration here.1 Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of of the American Republic, has made rather positive pronouncements on the end of the states. In his famous articles written under the pen name 'Pacificus' in defence of President Washington's Neutra- lity Proclamation of 22 April 1793 against American participation in the Napoleonic Wars, Hamilton explained that the universal ob- ject of all states was the acqusition of power, irrespective of the form of their governments, that states were not and ought not to be guided by idealistic or moral considerations (he was particularly pleading against going to the aid of France as an act of gratitude for * For some of the ideas expressed in this article, the writer is indebted to Prof. William T.

To William Pitt, war against France in 1793 was justified in so far as the principles of the French Revolution and the charac- ter of the French Republic threatened British national interests and, in particular, British security. And only to the extent they threatened British national interests, and for no other reason, Napoleon, and all that he represented, was to be opposed.3 After the Settlement of Vienna (1815), Castlereagh, the then British Foreign Secretary, adopted a similar policy. While he was vigorously opposed to the policy of the Holy Alliance, launched by Czar Alexander, aimed against all domestic revolutions as a rule, he was perfectly willing to oppose those domestic revolutions which directly affected British national interests.4 In the 1860s, there were the famous debates in the British House of Commons principally between Disraeli and Gladstone re- garding the question of British intervention in the massacre of Bul- garian christian subjects of Turkey. The latter urged British inter- vention with Turkey on humanitarian grounds and suggested that British national interests should take a secondary place as against "purposes of humanity". Disraeli (and Salisbury) opposed the sug- gestion as being not in British national interests. They argued that the supremacy of national interests was the only test of national policy and that in the particular case no British national interests were involved justifying Great Britain to go to war against its traditional ally, Turkey. He stated that the only British interests in Turkey was to keep Russia out of the Straits and presumably, therefore, that was an issue on which alone the British Government was pre- pared to fight.® 2.

RAJAN President Wilson, on the other hand, thought that there were no incompatible national interests. He believed in the theory of harmony of national interests.6 At the end of the first World War, therefore, he was hoping for a peace settlement consistent with the interests of all nations involved, and not in the interests of any single nation. That he found it impossible to arrive at such a settlement, is too wellknowii to call for any further comment on his thesis. This brief and sketchy historical background points to the existence of two main schools of thought on the idea of national in- terest - one holding that national interest comprises solely the short- term material objective of a country, and the other that the national interest of a country is that which is compatible with the interests of other countries and that it should take into consideration moral prin- ciples and ideals. We may call the first, the Realist and the second, the Idealist school of thought. How far are these two schools of thought tenable in practice? Just as a basis for discussion, we may consider the views of the leading American advocate of the Realist School. According to Prof. Hans J. Morgenthau of the University of Chicago, "international politics, like all politics, is a struggle for power. Whatever the ul- timate aim" he says, "power is always the immediate aim."7 Hence, according to him, international politics is of necessity power politics. Morgenthau points out, however, that though the struggle for power is widely practised in international relations and is universal in time and space, it is formally denied by all.8 This, he thinks, is due to the fact that power is a crude and unreliable method of limiting aspirations for power. Hence, those who seek power employ ideo- logies for concealment of their aims; these aims are usually clothed in reason, morality and justice, corresponding to the normative orders of ethics, mores and laws which recognise ubiquity of power drives and condemn them. Holding such views regarding the end of the state in inter- national politics, it is only natural for Morgenthau to deny that any considerations other than power enter (or ought to enter) into the formulation of national interest. Writing specifically with reference to American foreign policy in another place,9 he deprecates the habit 6. Ibid , p. 50. 7. Politics Among Nations , (New York, Knopf, 1948), Chap. I, pp. 13-18. 8.

He thinks that a foreign policy based on moral principles and not national interest is bound to fail, and for the following reasons. First, since the ends and means of any policy are determined by the power and resources available to back them, the objectives to be promoted have naturally to be arranged in terms of priorities. But, if moral principles are any guide, says he, then limited resources are of no consideration in determining objectives, for before moral law, all objectives are equal, "Mexico as important as Korea". He there- fore, concludes that a foreign policy based on moral principles is, of necessity, a policy of national suicide. Secondly, Morgenthau points out the difficulty of determining what is moral in international rela- tions, for he thinks that national and individual criteria cannot be applied to the behaviour of states in international politics. According to him, therefore, there exists no supra-national moral principles concrete enough to be of guidance to the actions of nations; nor he insists, is there an authority in the international field to protect and promote interests of individual nations impartially. Hence, he infers, the invocation of moral principles in support of national policies "is always, and of necessity, a pretence".10 Thirdly, Morgenthau holds that pursuit of moral principles is incompatible with the co-existence of other states, each of which is bound to have its own ideas regarding its national interests. A logical pursuit of a national policy, he says, leads to the imposition of one's own principles on other states, thus leading to the destruction of the very thing each state seeks to promote- And finally, Morgenthau is emphatic that no com- promise is possible between national interest and moral principles and asserts that a policy which vacillates between the two is bound to result in inconsistency and, ultimately, failure. Prof. William T. R. Fox of the Columbia University, New York has vigorously contested these views in the same issue of The Ameri- can Scholar.11 According to him, there is nothing like wholly moral or wholly national interests and any foreign policy has to take into account both the considerations. He emphatically repudiates as unscientific what is popularly known as the 'either-or-argumenť of Morgenthau, viz., that a state has to choose either national interest or moral principles. The chief task of the policy maker, says Fox, being the reconciliation of the desirable and the possible, moral prin- 10. Ibid, p. 211. 11. Ibid, pp. 212-216.</page><page sequence="5">192 M. S. RAJAN ciples necessarily enter any valid formulation of national interest. While, therefore, moral principles are not irrelevant to the formula- tion of national interest, in themselves, these principles provide no sure guide to policy. Secondly, Fox disagrees with Morgenthau's view that pursuit of moral principles is incompatible with the co-existence of states and asserts that one is not absolutely bound to respect the existence and individuality of every state, but only so long as actions of one state do not threaten the existence and individuality of every other state and that only compatible national interests are to be re- cognised. Further, Fox states that national interests of any state are incapable of objective determination except in terms of explicitly declared set of value preferences, and these latter usually combine moral principles with self-interest. Furthermore, Morgenthau's theory makes certain false assump- tions- Morgenthau appears to presume that power is the only value which the state seeks to promote and that other values are either non- existent or are subordinate to the consideration of power. While it is undoubtedly true that states have sought in the past, and do seek in the present, power to strengthen their security, it is factually in- correct to say that it is the only value they seek to promote and no other. Such a definition of the goal of the state would not be true even of all totalitarian states at all times or, as in the case of Hitlerite Germany, such states are short-lived. It can, therefore, be safely assumed that such a definition of the end of the state cannot be true of any democratic state, at least not for any reasonable length of time. A democratic state, while certainly trying to acquire power enough to assure full protection to its security, does seek to promote many other values which are of at least equal importance like, for instance, international co-operation through, and outside, the United Nations. Morgenthau makes a further erroneous assumption, viz., that the state is ordinarily a unity in striving for anything. While during a crisis - as during war - there is generally some kind of unity in the state to strive for a generally agreed goal (viz., victory, though there is bound to be still some difference of opinion as to the means of achieving that goal), there is clearly nothing of that unity during normal times. Public leaders and political parties in a democratic state - and to a certain extent even in totalitarian states - are bound to have difference of opinion not only as to the ends to be promoted but also as to the means of achieving those ends. It is a common phenomenon in democratic states that even the least controversial measures do not often evoke unanimous support of all leaders and parties.</page><page sequence="6">THE IDEA OF NATIONAL INTEREST 193 And Morgenthau appears to assume also that public leaders act rationally in promoting values they profess. This is by no means true. In the first place, decisions of public leaders are not taken with reference to any set principles and often, as is well-known, not even according to specific promises made in election manifestos ; they usually act under the compelling necessity of events and circumstan- ces over which they have little or no control. It is one thing to put down, for instance, the permanent features of British foreign policy as Sir Eyre Crowe once did in 1907, 12 but another thing to suggest that British Foreign Secretaries refer to some such document before taking any decisions. Christopher Mayhew, a former British Cabinet Minister, has explained13 how as soon as he entered office he asked a permanent official of the British Foreign Office for a document containing the current British foreign policy but was told, to his amazement, that no such document ever existed. Secondly, even if public leaders make up their minds to act meticulously according to certain rational and preconceived notions, they are not free to act so ; their hands are often tied by previous commitments of themselves and their allies or even enemies, by public opinion at home and abroad, by possible opposition by the legislative organ (like the U.S. Senate), by moral and humanitarian considerations, and the like. Morgenthau, has disputed14 the view that in the middle of the 20th century the interdependence of nations is so great that no nation can really stand alone and take care of its self-interest without jeopardising those very interests on account of lack of co-operation from other nations. According to him, "while there is, technologi- cally speaking, potentially one world, in actuality, from a moral and political point of view, never in the history of western civilization was the world, at least the politically active world, so divided as at present". In so far as Morgenthau is referring to American - Soviet relation, he is obviously correct, but not so with reference to the relations of a vast majority of other states, both between and among themselves. As explained in the sequel, the national interest of a country is deter- mined, among other factors, by the extent of international responsibility that particular country carries by virtue of its economic, industrial and military resources - the more its responsi- bilities, the greater is its need for allies (paradoxical though it may 12.

RAJAN seem), and the larger the number of its allies, the less is its national interest determined solely with reference to its own exclusive goals. Now, having so far tried to prove that Morgenthau's theory cannot be sustained as of the present, let us see if it was ever true in the past. Until the 20th century, control over more land was the chief index of power accumulation by states. Can it be conclusively proved by a study of the motives of imperialism that it was solely due to sheer greed for power? According to the Economist Hobson,15 imperialism is due to "medley of mixed motives". His own theory, however, is that it is due to a certain maladjustment between consumption and demand in the capitalist system and that foreign territory is sought to provide markets for surplus goods and surplus capital which re- sulted from that maladjustment. As against this "liberal theory", there are several socialist theories, and the most important of them is Lenin's theory of imperialism being only the highest and last stage of capitalism (or "monopoly stage of capitalism") after which the Socialist Revolution is supposed to occur.18 According to him capi- talism finally ends up in international monopolies and cartels which divide the world among themselves for providing markets for surplus goods and investments. There are several other theories: Schum- peter's theory of motivelessness (of imperialism being just an atavistic force) ,17 Seely's theory of the British Empire having been acquired in a fit of absent-mindedness,18 Spencer's theory of the survival of the fittest (i.e., that weaker states are liable to be absorbed by the stronger) , what is popularly known as the 'Devil's theory', according to which groups like ammunition-makers are responsible for impe- rialist ventures,19 the theory of 'preclusive imperialism' (according to which one state is supposed to seek control of strategic areas in order to forestall the enemy doing likewise later) , the 'spontaneous revolu- tion' theory (illustrated by the way the Soviet Union is alleged to have acquired control over the Eastern European states) , the raw material theory20 (viz., that colonies are acquired in order to control sources of raw materials), the 'three surplus' theory (according to which control over foreign territory is sought to relieve surplus population, 15.

If these various theories of imperialism prove anything at all, they certainly do not prove (if Morgenthau's theory is to be sus- tained), that in the past states have sought to acquire territory solelif in order to increase their power ; at the most, any proof is inconclusive, for in addition to the quest for power, many other motives obviously caused imperialist ventures in the past. A one-cause-theory, as that of Morgenthau, cannot but be un- scientific, for social phenomena are too complex for any such simplified explanation. If the state is an anthropomorphic monster bent on power accumulation, then national interest might be fixed, amoral and objectively determined. Except in the case of one or two states, and that only for short periods, as Hitler's Germany, such is not generally the case. Further, if the state is an intrument of a parti- cular group or groups in whose interest alone it is being run, then there cannot be any national interest, but only sub-national interest. The great American scholar, Charles Beard, thought there was no such thing as national interest of the United States and that it was simply a "pious fraud" to cloak the competing struggle of sub-national interests - the agrarian and the industrial, for control of national policies.24 This is, however, an absurd explanation of the way national interest is determined in a democratic set up. As Prof. Franz Neumann has pointed out,25 in a democratic state different parties and interests attempt to claim that their particular interest is really national interest, and in the process of doing so, each of the parties and groups makes certain adjustments and concessions to each other which in the final result represents the general interest of all the parties and groups ; this prevents the domination of the state by the interest of any one party or group. There is one further point of criticism. The advocates of world government appear to think that the state is a man-made obstacle to man's true interests and that, therefore, the only real interest is the supra-national interest. But, as is the case with all Utopian planners, 21. Ibid, p. 526. 22. Ibid, p. 558. 23. Winslow, The Pattern of Imperialism, (New York, Columbia University Press, 1948), p. 226. 24.

RAJAN the advocates of world government indulge in a lot of wishful think- ing and distort the present to suit their vision of the future. To call the state, which has had a long and natural historical development, a man-made obstacle to his supposed true interests is a historically fallacious statement. That a sovereign-nation-state has serious draw- backs, especially in the present stage of international relations, few will deny. But that does not justify the statement that it is a man- made obstacle to some imaginary true interests of men which are stated to be supra-national. Further, the advocates, of world government have not conclusively proved that national interest is always and necessarily contrary to supra-national interest. Now, let us see how national interest is determined in practice within a state. In a multi-party state, national interest is deter- mined, as referred to earlier, by the inter-action of the interests of competing groups, parties and leaders. In the light of public criti- cism and exposure, the policies and programmes of the different parties and groups get themselves, so to say, purified of such impuri- ties as narrowly selfish or group interests. If any one of the parties or groups is solely interested in mere quest for power, then, it is not likely to succeed (presuming that the democratic framework is retained) unless it is willing to compromise with o.ther parties or interests who might be seeking a different set of values. Thus, it is normally impossible for any one group or party seeking a narrow set of values or interests under a democratic political and constitutional set up. Sometimes, the interests of a particular group or party may not, in fact, be in conflict with national interest, as, for instance, of a group or body which has as its objective the promotion of universal literacy. It is also possible to think of sophisticated groups which may be disinterested in particular policies and programmes, but nevertheless support them as contributing to the general good- The point is, there is no use being cynical or suspicious of any particular group or interest, for in a democratic set up, none of them is in a totally decisive position. If this is how national interest is determined in a multiparty state, it is somewhat difficult to picture the way national interest is determined in a single party state as the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies. Presumably, in the case of such states, national in- terest is determined by such immutable factors as geographic location, historical antecedents and the like. It is not, however, clear how far national interest determined with reference to such factors and with- out public and open discussion reflects popular opinion in such countries,</page><page sequence="10">THE IDEA OF NATIONAL INTEREST 197 As regards a multi-party state like the People's Republic of China where all the parties are working on the basis of an agreed Common Programme, it is reasonable to assume that the Programme is the highest common denominator of their national interest, and since it has been adopted after prolonged discussion, that it reflects general public opinion. Externally, the national interest of a country is determined by several factors : its geographic and strategic location, its historical antecedents, its economic and industrial strength, its 'way of life' and political traditions. Its content can be both broadly and narrowly conceived. If narrowly conceived, it would encompass solely the material interests of itself without reference to either the national interest of other nations or any ideals or principles. This is a prac- tical impossibility, for reasons stated earlier. Further, as Woodrow Wilson once declared : "It is a perilous thing to determine the foreign policy of a nation in terms of material interest. It not only is unfair to those with whom you are dealing, but it is degrading as regards your own actions".28 Of course, pursuit of national interest in itself is not bad; it is its content that matters. As Abraham Feller, the Director of the Legal Department of the United Nations, has ob- served: "A sound domestic economy, firmness in the protection of legitimate rights abroad and the maintenance of strength to ward off attack are essential to national survivál- But we cannot advance a concept of national interest abroad without some ideal standard and at the same time convince others that our purposes are beyond reproach". Morgenthau argues that " a nation confronted with the hostile aspirations of other nations has one prime obligation - to take care of its own interests. The moral justification for this duty of all nations - for it is not only a moral right, but also a moral obliga- tion - arises from the fact that if this particular nation does not take care of its interests, nobody else will".27 Morgenthau is begging the question in presuming that the aspirations of all other nations are hostile to one's own country ; the fallacy of this assumption is obvious and need not be dilated upon. Besides, to say that devotion to one's self-interest is a moral obligation is a contradiction in terms; every civilization has deemed self-interest to be unethical. By the very nature of the present international society, the national interest of a country has to be broadly conceived, as otherwise the objective will be self-defeating. In fact, history provides ample examples of states 26. Quoted by Morgenthau in his article "What is the national interest of the United States?", The Annals, Op. Cit., p. 1. 27. The Annals, Op. Cit., p. 4. F- 3</page><page sequence="11">198 M. S. RAJAN trying to achieve their own exclusive material interests without refe- rence to the interests of other nations or to any moral ideals and principles having ignominiously failed in their attempts, the most recent examples being those of Germany, Italy and Japan. Even powerful countries are nowadays unable to achieve their national interests without having some allies and any country, howsoever powerful, cannot have allies to whom it can continually dictate - which means that the ultimate national interest of that country has to be in harmony with those of others. Mr. C. B. Marshall, a member of the Policy Planning Staif of the U.S. Department of State has brought out this point clearly in a brilliant article, appropriately entitled, "National Interest and National Responsibility".28 He appraises the role of the United States in international affairs by the seemingly paradoxical observation : " .... we can serve our national interest in these times only by a policy which transcends our national interest. This is the meaning of responsibility".29 If this is the fate of the most powerful nation in the present context of international relations, what of all the other less powerful sovereign nation states? From this long discussion, it is logical to conclude that the national interest of a country is in fact the mutual interest of itself and, at least, its allies. National interest in the sense of exclusive material interests of a country is non-existent in the case of most of the nations of the world. Let me illustrate this conclusion by two examples from current international affairs. The Truman Doctrine seeks to support and aid free peoples who resist subjugation by armed communist minorities within a state or cummunist pressures from without. It was proclaimed expressly for the benefit of Greece and Turkey, both of which received large amounts of economic and military aid. Now, if one takes at its face value President Truman's Message to the U.S. Congress dated 12th March 194730 (which propounded this Doctrine) , it would not be clear why the United States Government, of all other governments in the world, must, seek to bolster up against communist pressure free peoples whose countries are so far off from the United States. Could it be purely on account of humanitarian interest in the Greek and Turkish peoples or for any idealistic or moral reasons? Not entirely so. On the one hand the United States is now waging a 'cold war' against the Soviet Union and its allies and is therefore anxious to contain their 28. The Annals , Op. Cit., pp. 84-90. 29. Loc. Cit., p. 89. 30. Morgenthau and Thompson, Op. Cit., p. 210.</page><page sequence="12">THE IDEA OF NATIONAL INTEREST 199 communist ideology in a strategic area such as Greece and Turkey are situated in, and on the other these two countries were desperately in need of external assistance in order to protect their sovereign exis- tence. Thus, the interests of the United States and those of Greece and Turkey in the containment of communism were identical and hence the offer of the aid, and its acceptance, were in the mutual in- terests of the United States and Greece and Turkey. If it were otherwise, neither the U.S. Government would have proffered the aid, nor would Greece and Turkey have accepted such a large amount of foreign aid which would have been considered under normal circum- stances as jeopardising their sovereignty. A similar explanation equally holds good in the case of the European Recovery Programme (Marshall Aid). In his famous Harvard Speech of 5th June 1947, 31 General Marshall scarcely touched on explicit American interest in the political and economic recovery of Europe, and yet it is not as though the United States Government aided the Western European countries purely out of philantropic motives. The United States feared, as did democratic elements in Western European states, that the then existing serious economic conditions and the political vacuum in Western Europe would provide a fertile ground for the growth of communist ideology, particularly as the Eastern European states had succumbed one after the other by 1947, in similar circumstances, to communist pressures. The United States having as its global strategy the containment of communism considered it harmful to its political and strategic interests and, there- fore, offered economic aid (and, later, military aid under North Atlantic Treaty) in order to forestall such a possibility. Since this was equally in the interests of the dominant democratic elements in those countries, those countries eagerly accepted the aid. Therefore, the aid was in mutual interest. Sometimes, it is true, the mutual interest of two nations is not apparent and this generally happens when governments express their national policies in terms of moral generalities, not in terms of specific national policies as such. For instance, while testifying before a Committee of the U. S. Congress which was considering the India Food Aid Bill, the U- S. Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, called it a "humanitarian proposal".32 This, of course, is misleading charac- terisation, for it cloaks the mutual interests of the United State and India, in offering and accepting aid respectively. For one thing, 31. Ibid, p. 216. 32. Department of State Bulletin, Washington D.C., 12th March 1951, p. 424.</page><page sequence="13">200 M . S. RAJAN- THE IDEA OF NATIONAL INTEREST India approached the United States for food aid, not only because of the availability of food in the United States, but also, as the American Ambassador frankly asserted,33 because of its confidence in, and friendly disposition towards, the United States. In other words, India had some interest in maintaining and sustaining its friendly relations with the western democracies in general and the U.S.A. in particular in a bipolar world. Likewise, the United States presum- ably had some interest in the political and economic stability of a free India which would have been seriously jeopardised by a famine. Such an explanation eliminates the possibility of India compromising her freedom in accepting such large foreign aid, or the U.S.A. lacting with political motives in aiding India. The food aid was, therefore, clearly in the mutual interests of the giver and the beneficiary. The point is that in a sovereign-nation-state system, govern- ments have a habit of stating national policies in terms of moral generalities which cloak their real interestss (by which is not meant that it is necessarily selfish or wicked) . Even where moral consi- derations are involved, they often over-emphasise the moral aspect, sometimes to the point of not publicly expressing obvious national interest involved in the case. An instance of this political phenomenon is the fact that even totalitarian states with aggressive national policies justify their policies and actions in terms of inter- national peace and security. A student of international relations ought to be able to detect the implicit objectives of foreign policy issues stated in idealistic or moral generalities which is a concomitant of the sovereign-nation-state system- what Morgenthau calls "the standard operating procedure" of states; such statements of national policies do not, in themselves, provide any guide to the real national interests of states. 24th May 1953. 33.
