<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEizo serine, Transcendency and Symbols in the Old Testament: A Genealogy of the Hermeneutical Experiences (BZAW 275; Berlin/ New York: de Gruyter, 1999). Pp. ix + 441. DM 198. This book is a study of various encounters with transcendence through an interpretation of OT texts as symbols. Sekine's work is a welcome fusion of philo- sophical hermeneutics and traditional historical-critical exegesis. Specifically, S. builds upon the views of Paul Tillich, Hans Georg Gadamer, and Paul Ricoeur. Relying upon Tillich's concept of the "breaking of the symbols," S. wants to go beyond the personal god of the OT "who is immanent in time and space and interacts with the affairs of this world" (p. 10). On the other hand, he defers from radically demytholo- gizing the god of the OT into solely philosophical language, because the rhetorical power of the text lies precisely in its intrapersonal symbols. In the initial chapter S. explores the concept of transcendency in the Ten Command- ments. Relying upon Tetsuro Watsuji, who seeks to ground ethics in the prohibition of betraying trust, and upon Tillich, with his concept of unconditionality, S. argues that the Ten Commandments are ultimately symbols which present the secret of a faith relating unconditionality with unconditional transcendency.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 337 Following Nietzsche, S. portrays Qoheleth as a nihilist in the sense of a person holding that there is no meaningful purpose in the created world, no unity governing the world's affairs, and no real existence on the other side of death. He suggests that Qoheleth's hebel be translated as "nihil" and concludes that, like Qoheleth, we cannot be content with the presentation of an anthropomorphic God who appears directly in history. Nihilism offers the reader a model for pursuing transcendency on the basis of a "fresh encounter with the hidden negative God" (p. 127). In chap. 3, S. looks at the concepts of sin, forgiveness, and atonement in the passages on David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12 and Psalm 51). He eschews typical interpretations and offers a "Hellenic" interpretation which looks curiously like a "hermeneutics of suspicion" dressed in the garb of Thucydides. He concludes that there is more self-serving politics in those passages than is typically admitted. Both Nathan's parable and David's confession in Psalm 51 are attempts to effect political damage control by limiting David's sins, thereby exempting the king from full punish- ment for the sin committed against Uriah. An encounter with transcendency is situated in the "deep place within all of our hearts that can only be termed sin" (p. 213). In chap. 4, S., building upon Ricoeur, offers a full-blown interpretation of the Adamie myth, an interpretation based on symbolism, with transcendency appearing in the place of sin, seen in these passages as a negative state of loss as it pertains to human existence. In dealing with the passages about the serpent, S. maintains "that what the God who created the serpent desired was not that humans actually disobey but simply that they have the potential for disobedience" (p. 280). Although the discussion is radical in places, it is creative and worth reading. In the final chapter S. analyzes the concept of redemption in the Servant Songs of Second Isaiah. He relies upon a fresh redactional analysis of Isaiah as he explores the concept of transcendency in the servant's vicarious suffering. Ultimately, he sees vicarious redemption as the ultimate answer to Tillich 's analysis of symbols, because "it does not attempt to raise itself to absolute validity but also contains elements of self-negation that relativize itself" (p. 387). Although not all of S.'s interpretations succeed, he offers a fine exegetical history of these passages. His overall view of OT texts in terms of their latent transcendent symbols points toward a way in which postmodern interpreters can bypass the stulti- fying particularity engendered by typical historical-critical exegesis, so that they may understand "the general spirit that was originally intended in these utterances con- strained by particularity" (p. 46 n. 110). In that regard, the book is very timely, promising, and relevant. Gary D. Salyer, Fuller Theological Seminary of Northern California , Menlo Park, CA 94026</page></plain_text>
