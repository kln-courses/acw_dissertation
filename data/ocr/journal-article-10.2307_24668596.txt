<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHfUR QOMAH REVELATION IN JEWISH MYSTICISM BY HOWARD Μ. JACKSON 111 a fund-raising letter mailed out shortly after the event, American evangelist Oral Roberts reports having seen, at precisely 7 P.M. on May 25, 1980, a vision of Jesus Christ. As Roberts stood alone in prayer before his unfinished medical complex, the City of Faith, sud denly "I felt an overwhelming presence all around me," he writes in his account of the vision to his prospective donors. "When I opened my eyes," he continues, "there He stood, some 900 feet tall, looking at me. His eyes—Oh! His eyes! He stood a full 300 feet taller than the 600-foot tall [highest tower of the] City of Faith. There I was, face to face with Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God." Roberts watched as the gigantic figure scooped his hands under the complex and raised it, remarking how easy it was for him to do so. "I told you that I would speak to your partners," Roberts quoted the figure as assuring him, "and, through them, I would build it." Originally commissioned by God to His own specifications, the City of Faith had now received the support of the Son.1 Detractors quickly denounced Roberts' vision as a fraud. "No decent Christian believes that Jesus is 900 feet tall," Carl Mclntire, fellow evangelist and president of the International Council of Christian Churches, is reported to have groused. "Nor does Jesus make such appearances/' Mclntire went on to add, shifting to theological ground. "The Bible says Jesus is seated at the right hand of God."2 ' I rely for the details and the citations upon reports in The New York Times, October 17, 1980, B2; The Los Angeles Times, December 6, 1980, part 1A, 7; and Time maga zine, November 16, 1981, 64.

JACKSON For his part, Robert McAfee Brown, professor of theology and ethics at the Pacific School of Religion, Berkeley, assumes a mock-academic tone, attacking the vision on 'scholarly' grounds. As in Carl Mclntire's case, the particular focus of Brown's scorn is equally the epiphanic Jesus's 900-foot height, which he proposes to explore, not (ostensibly) with the issue of fraudulence for the vision in view, but toward a solu tion to "the more interesting epistemological question" how exactiy Roberts knew how tall the figure was. Brown examines four possible 'solutions' to this problem, replete with geometrical figures, math ematical formulae, and computational manipulation of large quantities of numbers: perhaps 1) the epiphanic Jesus informed Roberts how tall he was; or 2) Roberts estimated the number by triangulation; or 3) Roberts was able to calculate the number, again by triangulation, based on empirical knowledge of the length of a football field he gained as founder and president of Oral Roberts University; and 4) the vision has the support of a biblical parallel to the 300-yard Jesus in the 300 cubit length of Noah's ark. Brown concludes with the observations that a a 300-cubit = 450-foot Jesus stretches our credulity half as much as a 900-foot one and that, as far as the credibility of the vision itself is concerned, the numerological exercise of multiplying the digits of 1980, the year of the vision, results in a "likelihood-factor" of zero.3 Readers' responses to Brown's essay show a range of different reac tions. The first takes Brown's mocking tone to still more ridiculous lengths: Brown's hypothesis of triangulation in units of length of a foot ball field is to be replaced with skill in estimating the height of tall individuals Roberts is supposed to have acquired from the success of Oral Roberts University's basketball team, or, better yet, is to be replaced with a computation of the 900 feet achieved by multiplica tion of the 90-foot length of a standard basketball court by the number of the Ten Commandments. A second respondent, more sympathetic, suggests assessing Roberts's vision from a "purely psychological" stand point: any individual faced with a deepening financial crisis might "eas ily have his subconscious construct such a vision," which "would seem real to his conscious mind." Perhaps also, the same reader opines, Brown may not himself believe in visions. Yet a third respondent takes Brown to task for squandering his theological brilliance on ridiculing what was "obviously ridiculous" to begin with and for an arrogance 3 R. McA.

Like children they need to be gently disabused of their belief in Santa Claus.4 Oral Roberts's vision and the hostile or patronizing reactions which followed in its train are of considerable heuristic value for the subject I want to address: that element of ancient Jewish 'merkabah' mysti cism which, in the texts popularly called 'hekhalot' texts that preserve it in post-talmudic recensions, is regularly designated שיעור קומה, or "measure of the (divine) stature (or, form)." As the designation sug gests, Shfur Qomah (hereafter ShQ_) entails what purports to be vision ary encounter with God in a gigantic human form, the dimensions and secret names of the various parts of which the seer is granted to know as a revelation. This esoteric Jewish tradition has repeatedly drawn responses, from Mediaeval commentators and more modern scholars alike, which exactly parallel those elicited by Roberts's vision, and responses couched in equally strongly emotive and pejorative terms.5 4 Christian Century, July 8, 1981, 708-11. The responses conclude with a letter from Brown sarcastically misappropriating the remarks of Mclntire. Roberts later reported, in similar contexts, having other visions, one a seven hour conversation with Jesus, which evoked a second response from Brown, and another a vision of Jesus together with an angel "so tall his head touched the ceiling" of the room in which the vision was seen; the angel was "three times wide" (?). The seven-hour interview is detailed in Christianity Christianity Today, February 18, 1983, 29; Brown's response to it appears under the title "The Oral Tradition Strikes Again," Christian Century, March 14, 1984, 278-9. For the vision of Jesus and the angel see Christianity Today, September 21, 1984, 71-2. 5 Good accounts of the history of negative responses to ShQ_ are offered by A. Altmann, "Moses Narboni's 'Epistle on Shiur Qgma.' A Critical Edition of the Hebrew Text with an Introduction and an Annotated English Translation," Jewish Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies Studies (Cambridge, MA, 1967), 225-38, and by D. Blumenthal, "A Philosophical Mystical Interpretation of a Shi'ur Qomah Text," Studies in Jewish Mysticism. Proceedings of Regional Conferences Conferences Held at the University of California, Los Angeles, and McGill University in April 1978 (Cambridge, MA, 1982), 153-71. Altmann himself ("Narboni's 'Epistle'", 226) labels ShQ_ShQ_ShQ a "bizarre tract" and refers to its "crude anthropomorphism." Other moderns are equally judgmental: note, e.g., D.J. Halperin, The Faces of the Chariot. Early Jewish Responses toto Ezekiel's Vision (Tubingen, 1988), 225 n. 35 ("bizarre . .. fantastic"), 361 ("fantastic"), and, in a similar vein, 405-7; and P. Schafer, Der verborgene und offenbare Gott. Hauptthemen derder friihen jiidischen Mystik (Tubingen, 1991), 97 ("geradezu monstrosen"), 145 ("ganzen absurden"). Even Gershom Scholem, particularly in early work, describes SA() in strongly negative terms (e.g., Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism; New York, 1961 [1954], 64-5). Joseph Dan, "The Concept of Knowledge in the Shiur Qomah," Studies in Jewish Religious and and Intellectual History Presented to Alexander Altmann on the Occasion of his Seventieth Birthday (University, AL, 1979), 67-73, finds the astronomical numbers and mystical names of ^Q, revelations so incomprehensible and its anthropomorphism so crude that he con eludes its purpose must be an anti-anthropomorphic lesson in the incomprehensibility</page><page sequence="4">376 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON Condemned like Roberts's vision as fantastic blasphemy or childish superstition, it is small wonder that efforts to understand ShQ have made little progress. My objective here shall be to offer some basic observations toward setting ShQ revelation dispassionately and objec tively in its ancient religious context. Some good progress has been achieved. The ground-breaking stud ies devoted to Jewish mysticism by Gershom Scholem have made it clear that the gaonic date traditionally assigned for the emergence of ShQ revelation in Judaism is much too late and that, while a gaonic date may be accurate for the time at which our texts preserving ShQ revelation first reached written form, the roots of the tradition itself are shown by a variety of ancient texts to reach back at least as far as the time of the second-generation tannaim Akiba and Ishmael to whom the texts regularly ascribe the ShQ revelations.6 Good work also continues to establish the existence and the nature of the rabbinic con cept of the corporeality of God, a concept which, however distasteful to those influenced by Greek rationalism, particularly in its Platonic strains, has familiar origins reaching back into the anthropomorphic features of ancient Israelite theology.7 Excellent studies have equally of God; similarly in a good chapter on ShQ_in his /"®דלρΠ Π'Ί3ΰΠ ה0ר0טיקה (Tel Aviv, 1989) 48-58, particularly 54-7. 6 Scholem's most important studies appear in Major Trends 63-7; Von der mystischen GestallGestall der Gottheit: Studien zu Grundbegriffen der Kabbala (Zurich, 1962), 7-47; Origins of the Kabbalah Kabbalah (Princeton, NJ, 1987 [1962]), 20-4; Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and TalmudicTalmudic Tradition (2nd ed.; New York, 1965), 36-42 with Appendix D by S. Liebermann, 118-26, and the Adenda, 129-31; and Kabbalah (New York, NY, 1974), 16-7. The view that ShQ is of older than gaonic origin was equally held, more than a century ago now, by Moses Gaster, "Das Schiur Komah," MGWJ 37 (1893), 179-85 and 213-30 = Texts and and Studies (London, 1925-8) 2.1330-53 (I cite the latter; for the age of ShQ see, 1340 1).

JACKSON In pursuing my own objective of elucidating the ancient background of ShQ revelation in Judaism I shall focus on that feature of the tra dition which the phrase שיעור קומה shows was its essential element and which has also been that which has provoked all the pejorative responses: not the unintelligible secret names of the parts of the body of God, but rather the numbers that furnish their measure. I shall center my discussion around a collection of texts, most up to now unadduced, that illustrate and illuminate that background. The majority of these texts parallel SkQin entailing attribution of numerically measured dimen sionality to an anthropomorphically conceived divine figure. The scornful responses to Oral Roberts's vision illustrate what exactly it is, at bottom, that continues to elicit the pejorative judgments passed on ShQ. What is found so objectionable is not the gigantic size of the figure, nor even its human form, but rather the specification of its numerical dimensions. That superhuman size should not, in and of itself, occasion any problem for scholars of ShQ doubtless stems from the fact that few things are more commonplace in all cultural settings of the ancient Near East and Mediterranean in theophanic contexts, including biblical ones. The reason is clear enough. Magnitude implies strength, and amplitude power; the very words "greatness" and "grandeur" conjure up a majesty that flows from ample scope of spatial reach. One understands intuitively the implicit but direct relationship between the great size of the theophanic Jesus of Oral Roberts's vision and the ease with which the figure scooped up and raised the City of Faith in its hands. So commonplace is colossal size in ancient theophanies that by the 4th century ce Iamblichus, the Syrian Neoplatonist, feels the need to systematize and codify what by his time is centuries of antecedent are often printed in a corrupt form and, in any case, overlap either MSS published by Schafer or, at least, material contained in them, I cite Cohen's texts only when they offer traditions not preserved in Schafer's MSS). Cohen's view that ShQ was originally a so-entitled independent work, composed in Babylonia early in the gaonic period, and his claim to have discovered a copy of the Urtext from which all later SkQ passages derive are both unlikely to be accurate: see Peter Schafer's review of Cohen's earlier work The Shiur Qomoh. Liturgy and Theurgy in Pre-Kabbalistic Jewish Mysticism (Lanham etc., 1983; cited as Cohen 1) in JSJ 16 (1985) 129-31; the same author's appraisal of Cohen's later work in "Shiur Qoma: Rezensionen und Urtext," Hekhalot-Studien, 75-83; and K. Herrmann's lengthy critique of the same work in "Text und Fiktion. Zur Textiiberlieferung des Shiur Qoma," FJB 16 (1988) 89-142. The documents which con-■ tain ShQ_ revelations are, rather, compilations of various strands of a constandy redacted tradition whose origins long antedate the written forms in which these strands of tra dition are now preserved in the 'hekhalot' literature.</page><page sequence="7">ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHI'UR QOMAH 379 tradition. In Iamblichus's misnamed work On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, written in response to the characteristically Greek rationalist questions posed by Porphyry in his Letter to Anebo, Iamblichus concludes his dis cussion of theophanic magnitude with the following summary state ment, at the core of which is the basic recognition that size is power: Text la In general, the magnitude of the epiphany which each class (viz., gods, archangels, angels, daimons, heroes, rulers, and souls) man ifests is direcdy and properly proportional to the magnitude of the power which each class possesses and to the amplitude of the dominion through which its members extend influence and in which they exercise authority.10 The various classes of superhuman entity are listed in order of descending power and, consequently, of progressively diminished epiphanic size. Of gods, the most powerful class, Iamblichus's description of their epiphanic appearance approaches the exuberance of ShQ, revelation: Text lb The magnitude of the epiphany displayed in the case of gods is so huge that it occasionally eclipses even the entire sky...." Though for reasons that will emerge later Iamblichus is likely to have known traditions which revealed for visionary entities the numerical specifics that are characteristic of ShQ revelation, he refuses to assign anything so exact as numbers to his epiphanic magnitudes. His inten tion is nevertheless essentially the same: to convey, by focus on mag nitude, some inkling of the awesome power of the divine. That such is the intention of ShQ revelation has often been claimed, and this is certainly true of the essential element of gigantic size. "The theology of Shi'ur Komah is grounded," as Moshe Idel rightly observes, "in the biblical description of God as 'great,'" noting that גדול as an epithet 10 De Myst. 2.3-4 (83.19-23 des Places). All translations are my own, unless other wise noted. On this section of Iamblichus's ie Mysteriis see T.

With Iamblichus's statement compare the common assertion in ShQ_ texts that such-and-such a feature of God's body "fills the whole world"—for example, His face: Synopse §699 (MSS N8128, 01531, M40); and the soles of His feet: Synopse § 480 (MS M22), §695 (MS N8128), §948 (MS M40); Geniza-FragmenteGeniza-Fragmente G9 (6a.3, partly in lacuna), Gil (lb.2-3), all citing Isa 66:1—or it "reaches from one end of the world to the other"—for example, His tongue: Synopse §481 (MS M22), §699 (MSS N8128, 01531, M40), §949 (MS M40); Geniza-Fragmente G9 (6a. 18-9), G10 (13-4).</page><page sequence="8">380 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON of God is often coupled with another epithet connoting His power.12 It is not an accident that the two passages he adduces as examples, Deut 10:17 (האל הנדל הנכר והנורא, "the great, mighty, and fearsome god)" and Ps 147:5 (גדול אדונינו ודב־כח, "great is our Lord, and abound ing in power"), both play vital roles in ShQ texts. The former is cited repeatedly, and usually in a manner (preceded by לכך) that suggests that the preceding ShQ revelations prove the truth of it. For its part, Ps 147:5's ורב־כח is used to derive, by gematria, the basic figure (236) in the overall measurement, in thousands of millions of parasangs, of the height of the body of God.13 The biblical epithet גדול may readily be taken, if one is so inclined, to mean "of great size," and it may be used, with this meaning, to magnify the fearsome mightiness of God. But, like Iamblichus, the two biblical precedents eschew numerical measurement; a number must be extracted by gematria. Again, the reason is clear enough. Sheer mag nitude may convey a sense of the limitless power of God, but num bers, ultimately, do not. By their very nature numbers, even numbers reckoned in units of googols, function to delimit, and with that they confine what they measure. What the critics of Oral Roberts's vision and the pejorative descriptions of ShQ from scholars are really object ing to, Pausanias, the 2nd century ce author of the travelogue Desmption of of Greece, makes more explicit in his description of the sculptor Pheidias's gigantic chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia: Text 2 I know that measurements of height and breadth have been recorded of the Zeus at Olympia, but I cannot commend the people who 12 Kabbalah.

The popularity of the cited words from Deut 10:17 was doubtless aided by the fact that they figure in the opening of the ShemonehShemoneh Esreh. Neh 9:32 shows that they were already being used liturgically early in the Persian period. Ps 147:5's ורב־כח yielding 236 (thousand million parasangs) for the overall height of the body of God: Synopse §167 (MSS N8128, V228), §376 (MS N8128), §728 (MS M40), §939 (MS M40); Geniza-Fragmente G4 (lb.7-8, lacunose), G8 (lb.26-7, partly in lacuna), G10 (6-7, partly in lacuna); further see Herrmann, "Text und Fiktion" (as n. 9) 132 n. 149. Other passages give a figure which seems clearly to be a cor ruption of what was originally 236. On ShQs use of Deut 10:17 and Ps 147:5 see Cohen 1.93 and n. 39, 104, 107 and n. 80, 110, 114-5, 116-7.</page><page sequence="9">381 ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHIcUR QOMAH took the measurements because even the measurements they state fall far short of the impression that the statue makes on the viewer.14 "Even"Even the measurements:" the gigantic numbers may, on some abstract level, serve their intended purpose of conveying some notion of the impressive size of the statue and, consequendy, serve to exalt the grandeur of Zeus. But the numbers are no substitute for the real thing. They only limit the imagination, and, in that, they defeat their pur pose. In the end numbers succeed only in limiting the grandeur of what they seek to magnify. Pausanias s statement presupposes a reality common in ancient iconic cults: contemplation of a cult statue is felt to be experientially equiv alent to contemplation of the deity itself—cult iconography, in other words, is virtual theophany. But in Pausanias's objection this sentiment is overridden by his uncomfortable awareness that measurement of the dimensions of the icon, however much intended to magnify the god, represents a dangerous reification of the divine. With measurement there is a descent from the sublime to the meticulous, and the icon is thereby reduced to the level of a merely material object, commensu rate only, despite its gigantic size, with the delimited scale of human reality. In a very fragmentarily preserved poem (the sixth of his Iambi) the early Hellenistic Alexandrian poet Callimachus recites the recorded dimensions of Pheidas's Zeus.15 To judge from lines 45-6, where the speaker, perhaps the statue itself as in others of Callimachus's Iambi, mocks the inquisitiveness of the addressee, the poem was a parody. That probability suggests that Callimachus is addressing, in his own way, the same problem that Pausanias addresses. The parody plays upon the tension between, on the one hand, elevating contemplation of grandeur conveyed by magnitude and, on the other, the reduction 1st objectification inherent in the measurement of size. A similar tension is implicit in the setting and manner of ShQ revelation in the 'hekhalot' texts. Here there is no question of the recipient of the revelation laying a yardstick to the limbs of God, as 14 Pausanias, Description of Greece V, xi, 9 (2.32.17-21 Spiro). In his comments on this passage J. G. Frazer, Pausanias's Description of Greece (London, 1898) 3.544, provides ref erence to the disparate figures given by ancient authors for the height of the statue. 15 Text: Callimachus I.

The revelation is thus delivered by an intermediary, and yet the setting in which the revelation is given is the recipient's direct vision of God seated upon His throne, after Micaiah's vision in 1 Kgs 22:19 and Isaiah's in Isa 6.16 Micaiah and Isaiah, however, both hear Yahweh speak; the recipient of the ShQ revelation does not. And no wonder: to have God Himself reveal the dangerously limiting dimen sions of His body would conflict intolerably with the remote and un limited grandeur of His person. Luckily, God was forbidden from revealing the dimensions of His own body by the conventions of clas sical Jewish apocalyptic, for which, in this respect as in others, there is clearly continuity of tradition flowing from this earlier literature into the 'hekhalot' texts. In classical Jewish apocalypses the content of the revelation is never given as a direct oracular pronouncement by a heav enly being but always involves an angel mediator. In the ShQ^texts this role is fulfilled by Metatron. This conflict between the vision of God and His concealment is par allel, then, to that which exists between the revelation of the dimen sions of His form and the unlimited grandeur of His power. They both help account for why one long series of ShQ revelations is suddenly interrupted with the surprising claim that "we have no measure in our hands; only the names are revealed to us." It is important to note that the statement is preceded by assertions about Him that maintain His concealment, His invisibility: "the appearance of His face and the appearance of His cheeks are as the form of spirit (or, wind) and the shape of soul; no (mere) creature can comprehend Him. His body is like tarshish. His radiance shines out awesomely from the midst of the darkness; cloud and mist surround Him. . .These are attributes of which there can obviously be no numerical measure, and here, 16 Synopse §688 (MSS N8128, 01531, M40), §692 (same MSS, with N8128 adding "who is hidden from all creatures"), §§947-8 (MS M40, equally with "who is hidden from all creatures"); Geniza-Fragmente G8 (lb.45-9), G9 (6a. 1-3).

In this lies the truth of Joseph Dan's surmise (see note 5) that ShQ is an anti anthropomorphic lesson in the incomprehensibility of God. Callimachus's sixth Iambus included the dimensions of the throne of Pheidias's Zeus, and so too do the 'hekhalot' texts, with Micaiah's and Isaiah's visions of Yahweh enthroned behind them.18 To provide the dimensions of the throne is natural enough in the measurement of enthroned figures. But lines 37-8 of Callimachus's poem, as, equally, Oral Roberts's vision, show what the most important dimen sion was: Text 3 The god himself is five cubits higher than the seat (of the throne).19 That the overall height was likewise the crucial number in ShQ rev elation can be seen from the facts that such is the basic meaning of sage), 144-6, 158-9; R.

Herrmann; Tubingen, 1994; text 16*-7*, translation p. 143, commentary 221-5). Metatron the intermediary's own throne is the object of ShQ revelation at Synopse §295 (MS B238), §405 (MS N8128); so too, even, is his body in Cohen 2.40-1 (Siddur Rabbah lines 32-5). The dimensions of David's heavenly throne are also revealed (Synopse §125). Thrones are inanimate objects that need to be meas ured to be constructed; they are consequently less controversial objects of ShQ revela tion than the body of God or of his vizier. 19 In line 31 the height of the throne is given as 30 feet, so that, with the units of measurement equalized, the proportion of the height of the throne to the overall height of the statue was four to five (Pfeiffer, "Measurements of the Zeus at Olympia," 3, in the commentary to lines 37-8, and 4). ShQ texts equally give dimensions for the height of the figure in relationship to the throne: "from the throne of His glory upwards" Synopse Synopse Synopse Synopse §167 (MSS N8128, 01531, M40, M22, D436, V228, B238 [+ the same num ber "from the throne of His glory downwards" MSS N8128, V228]). It is clear from other versions of the same, however, that it is the overall height of God that matters, since in these other instances the throne does not figure in the measurement, and the measurement of the seated figure is usually given (the exceptions being corrupted forms) as half the 236 derived from Ps 147:5 for the overall height of the body of God: most fulsomely in Synopse §376, where 118 is given as the base figure for "the height of His form when He is sitting on the throne of His glory;" then, a little later as an inter ruption, 230 (read 236) for the height when He stands; then, further on, as "another version," 108 (read 118) for the measure "from the middle of the seat of His dignity downwards;" then 236 for "His (total) height" (MS N8128); abbreviated versions with similar figures occur at Synopse §728 (MSS 01531, M40), §939 (MS M40); Geniza Fragment( G4 (lb.4-8), G8 (lb.22-7).</page><page sequence="12">384 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON the word קומה and that it was a number for the overall height that was extracted from Ps 147:5's !ורב־כד and not for any of the many other dimensions enumerated in ShQ texts. Once again, the reason for this is clear. It is tallness, the dimension of height, that conveys the impression of divine grandeur. Other measurements may be provided, but the overall height is the crucial element. Those who measured Pheidias's Zeus needed to disclose no other measurements for the figure. They could presume its basic conformity to what would culminate in the measured proportions of the male human body established by the sculptor Polykleitos's famous "canon,יי or standard.20 It is worth noting, however, that a similar concern for the correct proportions of the human body is also evident in ShQ texts. Although the MSS often preserve the numbers in corrupted or artificially manipulated forms, it is nevertheless clear—despite an early negative appraisal of the situation by Gershom Scholem—that, with the 236 derived by gematria from Ps 147:5 for the overall height of the body of God serving as the base figure, the numbers given for the size of various parts of the divine body betray awareness of correct propor tion. We are also given equivalencies between various body parts that are roughly accurate. We are told, for example, that the length of the nose is the same as that of the little finger and that the height of the cheeks is the same as half the circumference of the head—"and the same is true," we are further informed in this regard, "of the meas ure of every man."21 Concern for the correct proportions of the human body may thus have been the engine driving some of the features of ShQ revelation. 20 D. Schulz, "Zum Kanon Polyklets," Hermes 83 (1955) 200-20; H. v. Steuben, DerDer Kanon des Polyklet (Tubingen, 1973); R. Tobin, "The Canon of Polykleitos," AJA 79 (1975) 307-21; A. Stewart, "The Canon of Polykleitos: A Question of Evidence," JHSJHSJHSJHS 98 (1978) 122-31. Egyptian art, too, had a canon of proportions for the human form: see E. Iversen, "Diodorus' Account of the Egyptian Canon," JFA 54 (1968), 215-18. 21 The length of the nose the same as that of the little finger: Synopse §483 (MS M22), §700 (MS N8128), §951 (MS M40); Geniza-Fragmente G9 (6a.38, largely illegible). The same observation about the commensurate lengths of the human nose and little finger is cited as a baraita in bBek 44a. Scholem (Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and and Talmudic Tradition 40-1) holds that the talmudic citation is a quotation from ShQ_ tradition, not the reverse; Cohen 1.28-9, citing Lieberman, is not so sure. The height of the cheeks = half the circumference of the head and the same goes for every human being: Synopse §701 (MS N8128, with וכן כל מדח אדם corrected to וכן מדת כל ארם) §951 (MS M40); Geniza-Fragmente G9 (6a.39).

Whatever that engine was, it equally cannot originally have been the desire to magnify the glory of God with numbers of gigantic magni tude because, as we have seen illustrated in Pausanias, in Callimachus, and in ShQ texts themselves, numbers have the self-defeating property of delimiting and so of diminishing the glory of God. It is for this rea son that Iamblichus avoids them, Pausanias condemns them, Callimachus mocks them, and the ShQ tradition, in the passage discussed above, denies human possession of them. The only instances in which Greeks, at least, tolerated them were when they were used to fix the super human stature of men or demigods of a bygone, heroic age. Figures such as these were human, or humanoid; they did not possess a majesty that could be threatened by the limiting specificity of numbers. Homer set the precedent for Greeks with what he has Odysseus relate of the size of Otos and Ephialtes in the course of Odysseus's story of his visit to the land of the dead. It is a story told to entertain his hosts in the Never-never-land of the Phaeacians and thus not much above the level of a fairytale. Otos and Ephialtes, claimed by their human mother to be sons of Poseidon, plotted to pile Mount Ossa on Mount Olympus and Mount Pelion on Mount Ossa in an attempt to scale the heavens and make war on the gods. Had not Apollo done away with them first they would have succeeded because Text 4 verily at nine years old they were full nine cubits broad, and in height they had grown to nine fathoms.22 The asseverative particle τοι ("verily"), reinforced by γε and followed by an emphatic καν (rendered with "full"), shows that this is but a 'tall tale,' so much beyond belief as to need a playful assertion of its 'truth.' The triple repetition of the same number in the measurements, 22 Odyssey XI, 311-2. Further 011 in Odysseus's tale (Odyssey XI, 577), in his account of his visit to the land of the dead, he recounts having seen other bugaboos of ancient myth, like Otos and Ephialtes themselves too perpetrators of outrage against the Olympians, undergoing punishment; one of them, a prostrate Tityos, is said, equally like Otos and Ephialtes, to be nine measures long. The number nine functions in Homer as a cipher for largeness generally: note elsewhere, to select merely a few examples, the Trojan war lasting nine long years (Iliad II, 295); the god Apollo's arrows striking the Greek camp with plague for nine long days (Iliad I, 53); and the wounded Ares bellowing with a sound as loud as nine thousand men could make (Iliad V, 859-61).

JACKSON 386 a characteristic feature of the folktale, is further indication—as if any were needed—that the whole is not meant to be taken seriously. With this Homeric precedent in the background it is no surprise to discover Flavius Philostratus, in his Heroicus (written around the turn of the 3rd century ce), having a sophisticated Phoenician seafarer refuse to believe Text 5 the stories told about the great size of the heroes, how they were ten feet tall, and continue to be unconvinced by the accounts his interlocutor, a pious vinedresser, retails of enormous sizes measured by the skeletons of ancient heroes and giants given up by the earth.23 It is understandable that remarkably tall races of humans would be remembered for this attribute and that the rare instances of individual giantism would invite measurement which might, then, at times, be preserved by tradition. The latter seems to be the case with the Philistine hero Goliath, whose height is recorded to have been six cubits and a span (1 Sam 17:4); and the former may underlie the tradition preserved by Jubilees 29:9 that the Raphaim who originally inhabited Gilead were ten cubits tall, or nine cubits, or eight cubits, or down to seven cubits, where the dim inishing series gradually approaches the credible. Goliath's height, at least, is within the realm of possibility, but the Greek cult of heroes naturally lionized the objects of its devotion and, with that, ascribed to them the kind of impossibly elevated statures we see in the stories told by Philostratus's vinedresser. Sceptics who shared the Phoenician sea farer's view saw this doxological inflation for what it was and refused to believe it. Moderns may share the view of sceptical Greeks (and Phoenicians) and refuse to take ShQ seriously, as we have seen. But there is no indi cation that the ShQ texts themselves take their content anything but seriously and reverently. If it was not, or not only, originally the desire to magnify the majesty of God with numbers of astronomical magni tude, and it was not the Jewish equivalent of Polycleitus's canon, then what was the engine driving ShQ^ revelation? 23 Philostratus, Heroicus 7.9-8.18 (7.25-11.7 de Lannoy).

It is a passage from the great satirist Lucian of Samosata (mid-2nd century ce), the self-appointed debunker of all superstitious claptrap. In his Lover of Lies he takes on the supernatural—a favorite topic for his invective. In Platonic style the work is given the format of the report of a conversation had at the house of one Eukrates, who is depicted as an elderly man of imposing mien and a devotee of phi losophy. One of the stories he has to tell is the following: Text 6 "Well, but listen to what I saw five years ago," Eukrates said, "and this has the support of witnesses. It was around harvest time, but at midday I left the workers harvesting in the field and went off by myself into the woods, pensively mulling something over as I went. When I had entered the thicket, first there came a yelping, of dogs, and I thought it must be that my son Mnason was playing at hunting, as he often did, and had entered the covert. But that wasn't what it was, because a moment later an earthquake came, and a roar as of thunder, and then I saw a woman coming toward me, terrifying-looking, half a mile, almost, in height. She had a torch in her left hand, too, and a sword in her right that must have been twenty yards long, and down below she had snake feet, and above she was like a Gorgon, the look she gave, I mean, and how the sight of her made your hair stand on end, and instead of hair she had the snakes spilling down, twirling about her neck like curls, and on her shoulders some of them were coiled. Look how my hair is standing on end, friends," he said, "as I tell the story." And as he spoke Eukrates kept showing how the hair on his arm really was standing on end for the terror he felt. Ion, Deinomachos, Kleodemos, and their friends, all agape, had their attention riveted on him, grand fatherly old men led along by the nose, tamely kowtowing to so unlikely a Colossus, a woman half a mile tall, a gigantic female boogeyman. As for me, I was thinking all the while how vener able old men such as they were actually keeping the company of children to get wisdom and were admired for it by many, and how only their grey hair and beards distinguished them from babies, but all in all not even babies were as gullible to hum bug. Deinomachos, for instance, interjected, "Tell me, Eukrates: the goddess's dogs, how big were they?" "Taller than Indian ele phants," he answered, "and black like them, and all shaggy with a matted coat of filthy hair. Well, when I saw her I froze and I turned the signet ring the Arab had given me to the inside of my finger, and Hecate stamped on the ground with her snaky</page><page sequence="16">388 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON foot and made an enormous chasm, deep as the depth of Tartarus, and then a moment later she jumped into it and was gone." Eukrates's vision ends with his peering into the chasm, at the bottom of which, before it closes up again, he sees Hades and the souls of the dead.24 Entertaining as it may be, I apologize for so long a citation, but it is instructive on a number of grounds, not least precisely because it is satire. Satire depends on stereotype, and stereotype, in turn, is charac terized by what its contemporaries assume to be typical of the subject. Considering the role that specification of exact numerical measure ment plays in Eukrates's vision—not surprisingly, from the foregoing discussion, it is a question of Hecate's gigantic overall height as well as the length of her huge sword—it is fair to conclude, consequently, that this was an increasingly common but, from a traditional Hellenic perspective, an alien and newly-imported element in contemporary Greek visionary contexts. Lucian expects his educated Greek readers, in other words, to share with Lucian's "I" not only a derisive laugh at what we have seen from Iamblichus, Pausanias and Callimachus is the outlandishly un-Hellenic phenomenon of divine measurements in visionary settings, but equally to share a commiserative nod of recog nition as well: they have heard this story all too often before, even on the lips of men who, like Eukrates, fancy themselves philosophers. I shall turn shortly to showing that the revelation of divine measure ments, often specifically in visionary settings, is indeed attested in non Greek contexts, and anciently so in Egypt and in Mesopotamia. It was doubtless as a result of influence from cultural contexts such as these that SAQ;type revelation got taken up by Greeks of Lucian's day. Like Callimachus and the critics of Oral Roberts's vision, Lucian pokes fun, then, at the provision of exact measurement ("so unlikely a Colossus, a woman half a mile tall, a gigantic female boogeyman"). For comic effect he has Eukrates hedge in giving the measurements, covering in self-conscious embarrassment for the patent exaggeration and for what he knew to be their Greek audacity: the figure was "half a mile, almost, in height," and its sword "must have been twenty yards long." But Lucian was a keen observer of human nature, and it is further worth noting that he hints at why specification of exact numerical measurement plays so important a role in visionary contexts. Visions 24 Lucian, Philopseudes 22-4 (II, 189.5-190.6 MacLeod). For commentary see L. Muller, In Luciani Philopseuden Commentarius (Paris, 1932), 82-7.</page><page sequence="17">ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHIcUR QOMAH 389 may be real enough to the visionary, but others, even others as ready to believe as Eukrates's auditors, need convincing. Visions are para normal phenomena, outside the range of everyday experience, and so they require verification if others are to believe they 'actually' occurred. Eukrates is said to have resorted to the effective device of swearing on the lives of his children, and, after his account of the vision, he fol lows up on his opening statement in it by appealing to a witness for corroboration.25 But he knows what the fisherman in the famous 'fish story' knew when he offered validating confirmation of the size of his catch with a measuring spread of his hands; he knows that the surest way to authenticate his story is to furnish exact and detailed data within the body of the account itself. Like modern pitchmen, Eukrates under stands instinctively that specifics, and particularly numbers, convey the impression of a scientific objectivity, and thus of factuality, that flows automatically from mathematical precision. We see this principle at work in Roberts's vision, where, in addition to the exact height given for the Jesus of the vision, Roberts is specific as to the exact time the vision took place. It is no doubt partly for this reason—authentification through numerical exactitude—that numbers play so large and nor mative a role in classical Jewish apocalyptic, particularly in visionary contexts.26 But the crucially important element of the passage from Lucian is that the setting is a vision. As I said just now, the facts that Lucian is writing satire and that satire depends upon stereotype imply that theo phanic measurement is likely to have been an increasingly common feature in accounts of visions in Lucian's time in the 2nd century ce. I shall turn now to examine a visionary text, from a generation or two earlier than Lucian, that furnishes supporting evidence for this deduc tion. But first it is important to note that, as we saw earlier, ShQ revelation is itself regularly set in a visionary context and that the visionaries are the early 2nd-century tannaim Akiba and Ishmael, older contemporaries of Lucian, and Ishmael's pupil Nathan, a near con temporary of Lucian. The idea that there might be historical truth behind all the many and disparate traditions, both within and without the 'hekhalot' literature, which make these men (and their teachers 2נ Phibpseudes 5 and 24, respectively. ib For numbers in Jewish apocalyptic see, e.g., D. S. Russell, The Method &amp; Message of Jeivishof Jeivishof Jeivish Apocalyptic (Philadelphia, 1964), 127, 187, 195-202. In the Mediaeval apoca lypse commonly called 3 Enoch (Sefer Hekhalot) the tradition culminates in numbers, and specifically measures, being given for just about every heavenly entity and object described, including the height (and, in one case, also the breadth and width) of various angels.</page><page sequence="18">390 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON Eliezer ben Hyrkanos and Nehuniah ben Ha-Qanah as well) the pro totypical 'merkabah' mystics and which ascribe 'merkabah' visions to them was adhered to, somewhat desultorily, by Gershom Scholem and, after him, Ithamar Gruenwald. But it has lately been called into ques tion, as has also, concomitantly, the likelihood that there is any direct continuity with similar visionary traditions in earlier Jewish apocalyp tic texts.27 But with the evidence I am about to present in support of what Lucian suggests, namely, 5AQ;type revelation in a visionary set ting in a Jewish text roughly contemporary with Akiba and Ishmael, there is less reason to doubt that the attribution of ShQ revelation to these men is genuine, however much more primitive a form it may have taken with them. It is true that classical Jewish apocalypses ascribe themselves pseudonymously to worthies of the ancient past, but the v Scholem's works are those cited in note 5. Ithamar Gruenwald's is that cited in note 22; note further relevant work (particularly Chapter 4) in his collected essays, From Apocalypticism Apocalypticism to Gnosticism. Studies in Apocalypticism, Merkavah Mysticism and Gnosticism (Frankfurt am Main, etc., 1988). For succinct presentations of the various views see Wolfson, Through Through a Speculum That Shines (as n. 7), 74-9, 108-24; C. R. A. Morray-Jones, "Hekhalot Literature and Talmudic Tradition: Alexander's Three Test Cases," J-SJ 22 (1991), 1-39, particularly 1-5. Morray-Jones's own view, which I share, is a modified Scholem Gruenwald hypothesis; in addition to the work just cited and those cited in note 8 see his "Transformational Mysticism in the Apocalyptic-Merkabah Tradition," JJS 43 (1992) 1-31. The most influential voices of opposition have been David Halperin's, Ephraim E. Urbach's, and Peter Schafer's. For Halperin see, in addition to the work cited in note 5 and his The Merkabah in Rabbinic Literature (New Haven, CT, 1980), the more recent essay "Heavenly Ascension in Ancient Judaism: The Nature of the Experience," Society Society of Biblical Literature 1987 Seminar Papers (Atlanta, GA, 1988), 218-32.

Scholem on his Seventieth Birthday by Pupils, Colleagues and Friends (Jerusalem, 1967), Hebrew section, 1-28. Peter Schafer's position is most succinctly set out in "The Aim and Purpose of Early Jewish Mysticism," Hekhalot-Studien (as n. 9), 277-95. Joseph Dan agrees with Urbach as far as Yohanan ben Zakkai, a generation before Akiba and Ishmael, is concerned, but thinks (the claim of) genuine 'merkabah' visionary expert ence begins with Akiba and his generation: see, e.g., Dan's overview essay "The Religious Experience of the Merkavah," Jewish Spirituality from the Bible through the Middle Ages (New York, NY, 1986), 289-307, in particular 290-4. But texts from Qumran like the Shirot 'Olat'Olat ha-Shabbat suggest that 'merkabah' ecstaticism is older than Yohanan ben Zakkai: see, e.g., the discussion by L. Schiffman, "ספרות ההיכלות וכתבי קומראן," Early Jewish Mysticism.Mysticism.

At 1.82-7 Cohen discusses the his toricity issue and favors the view that the attribution of ShQ_ revelation to Akiba and Ishmael (and Nathan) is pseudepigraphic; later, however, at 2.2 and n. 7, he seems less certain.</page><page sequence="19">ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHIcUR QOMAH 391 canonical Christian apocalypse, whose author was a contemporary of AJubaAJuba and Ishmael, shows that this convention was then beginning to be defied. And there is equally less reason to doubt, in the light of this evidence, that Akiba and Ishmael claimed to have acquired their ShQ revelation in visionary experience, as our ShQ texts regularly maintain. After presenting this evidence I shall address the issue of continuity with 'merkabah' visions in earlier Jewish apocalyptic texts insofar as it affects the issue of ShQ revelation. The visionary text in question has frequently been cited for the par allelallel to ShQ which its inclusion of specific numerical measurements for its visionary figures provides.28 Because it has remained an isolated text in this regard, however, its relevance for the history of the evolution of ShQ revelation has not been fully appreciated. From the fragments in which the work(s) reporting it survive(s), the vision appears to have been the inaugurating event in the foundation of the sect, evidently from the outset Jewish-Christian, called Elchasaite (or Elkesaite) after the Christian church fathers who preserve the fragments. The sectar ian label derives from what was probably the title by which the work in its original Aramaic form was known, the Book of the "Hidden Power" (חיל כסי). The phrase "Hidden Power" seems likely to have designated the two figures who appear in syzygy in the vision and mediate, as a revelation, the in many ways radically innovative doc trinal content of the document; it may or may not also have been a name assumed by the otherwise anonymous author of the original doc ument for being the Hidden Power's prophet and/or incarnation. From the facts that the book referred to the Roman emperor Trajan's cam paign beyond the Parthian frontier and that Mani, the Persian founder of Manichaeism, is known to have grown up in an Elchasaite com munity, we may conclude that the work was written in Mesopotamia in the mid-'teens of the 2nd century ce. Another chronological datum dates the inaugurating vision to the third year of Trajan's reign—i.e., about a decade and a half before the work recording the revelations 28 E.g., Μ. Smith, "Observations on Hekhalot Rabbati," Biblical and Other Studies (Cambridge, MA, 1963), p. 151; Stroumsa, "Le couple de l'Ange et de l'Esprit" (as n. 8), 43-4; idem, "Form(s) of God" (as n. 8), 278-9; Cohen 1.38-9 n. 64; Fossum, "Jewish-Christian Christology and Jewish Mysticism" (as n. 8) passim, but particularly 260-3; M.

JACKSON 392 granted by the vision reached its first written form.29 The vision itself dates, in other words, to the turn of the 2nd century ce. For the vision described in this extremely interesting document, our earliest report is from Hippolytus, a presbyter of the church in Rome early in the 3rd century ce. Hippolytus felt himself obliged to refute the use to which the work was being put by one Alcibiades, an Elchasaite missionary who brought a Greek and, with that, a to some degree or other redacted version of it to Rome from Apamea in Syria. According to Alcibiades, the book had been Text 7a imparted as a revelation by an angel whose height was 24 fur longs (which is 96 miles). His breadth was 4 furlongs, and from shoulder to shoulder he was 6 furlongs. The tracks of his feet were 3 and a half furlongs long (which is 14 miles), one and a half furlongs wide, and half a furlong deep. There was also a female with him whose measurements were comparable, he says, to those just given. The male was Son of God, and the female was called Holy Spirit.30 Later we are informed that the Son of God was addressed as "great king."31 Jarl Fossum righdy notes of this last epithet how frequendy in 'hek halot' texts God has heaped upon Him tides whose core element is 29 For the various issues and problems posed by the Book of Elchasai, its recensions, its transmission to the West, its date, its content, its sectarian affiliations, etc., one may consult, e.g., G.

For purposes of comparison he follows Hippolytus's account of the vision of Elchasai with a ShQ text derived from the Sefer Raziel, concluding that there can be no doubt that the Book of Elchasai was dependent upon traditions similar to those developed by 'merkabah' mystics.32 He leaves it to the reader to note the parallels between the vision of Elchasai and the ShQ passage from the Sefer Raziel, but the parallels in the ShQ texts of the 'hekhalot' literature are worth point ing out explicitly. The measurements in the vision of Elchasai begin, not unexpectedly, with the overall height of the angel; as we saw in the context of discussion of Text 3 there is nothing unusual about that. But the two sources share the specification of three unusual dimensions in common: the breadth, the distance from shoulder to shoulder, and the thickness of the soles of the feet.33 The extent of common ground might be pushed even further by arguing that the only reason specific figures for the length and width of the soles of the feet are not offered in ShQ texts, as they are in the vision of Elchasai, to round out the figure for the depth is that ShQ texts are able here to adduce a bibli cal proof-text in Isa 66:1 and so content themselves with observing, as we saw (note 11 above), that the soles of God's feet fill the whole world. Specific numbers were thereby rendered superfluous. It is true that the Book of Elchasai is referring to the depth of the imprints (ίχνη) made in the ground by the soles of the feet of the figures as they stood before the visionary, whereas the ShQ texts seem to be measuring the height (נובה) of the soles of God's feet as He sits enthroned, proceeding from the ground upwards and moving on after that to the distance from the soles to the ankle and so on. But it is worth noting that the ShQ texts regularly use one word for the soles of the feet (פרסות) when they speak of them filling the whole world and when they fix their vertical dimension at such-and-such a number but shift to a different term (□כף רנלי) when they proceed to give the 32 Fossum, 'Jewish-Christian Christology and Jewish Mysticism" (as n. 8), 260-3; sim ilarly "Colossians 1.15-18a" (as n. 8), 198-200. Baumgarten, "The Book of Elchasai and Merkabah Mysticism," 220-1, inexplicably cites one of the curtailed versions of the vision offered by Epiphanius. On "king" as a title of God in 'hekhalot' hymns see Cohen 1.88-95. 33 The measure of breadth: Synapse §483 (MS M22), §951 (MS M40); Geniza-Fragmente G9 (6a.49-50).

JACKSON distance from the soles of the feet to the ankles. This shift might only be due to a desire for an expanded repertoire of anatomical technical terms, or it might be for the sake of a pun on פרסא, "parasang," the standard unit of measurement in SkQ texts, or both. But with "heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool" cited from Isa 66:1 in their connection, it would be logical to conclude that the פרסות refer to the imprint of God's feet in the earth on which His feet rest and that their measure is, properly speaking then, not of their height but rather of their depth. On this reckoning the ShQ texts' פרסות are all the more strictly parallel to the 'ίχνη of the figures in the vision of Elchasai. But even with only the measure for breadth, the measure from shoul der to shoulder, and the measure of the vertical dimension, whether viewed as height or depth, of the soles of the feet in common, it is hard to avoid sharing Jarl Fossum's conviction that the vision of Elchasai was dependent upon traditions similar to those preserved in the ShQ texts of the 'hekhalot' literature. The numbers have undergone con siderable inflation over the centuries that separate the Book of Elchasai from the 'hekhalot' literature, but the unusual parallels between what it is that the numbers in the two sources measure suggest that there is a very intimately close relationship between them. It is also hardly likely to be merely a coincidence that Akiba and Ishmael, the principal visionaries of our ShQ texts, are exact contem poraries of the Elchasaite visionary and the original Aramaic form of the book of Elchasai. These convergences of content, visionary con text, and chronology add further support for the view, which I argued earlier on the basis of Lucian's presupposition of increasingly wide spread occurrence of ShQtype information in visionary settings in the 2nd century ce, that the attribution of ShQvisions to Akiba and Ishmael is historically accurate. The parallels with the Book of Elchasai, itself too stemming from a Jewish context, however sectarian, suggest that that feature of ShQ revelation on which I am focusing, the revelation of the measurements of the divine form, first began to emerge in Jewish contexts in the course of the late 1st and early 2nd centuries ce. If the involvement of Elchasai's contemporaries Akiba and Ishmael in this development can be accepted, it means that it was indeed they who were largely or principally responsible for its introduction, in the con text of 'merkabah' visions, into early tannaitic Judaism. 'Merkabah' visions exist from before this time, and they are regu larly replete with numbers. The presence of numerical specifics is a phenomenon which, as I remarked earlier, is characteristic of Jewish</page><page sequence="23">ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHfrUR OOMAH 395 apocalyptic, particularly in visionary contexts. Not surprisingly, meas urement, too, plays a role in them at times—so, for example, in 1 Enoch 61 (in the Similitudes of Enoch). Moreover, various biblical precedents involving measurement guaranteed later imitation: there are 1) the construction of the desert Tabernacle and its equipment to exact dimen sions specified by God (Exod 25-27, 36-38); 2) all the numerical pre cision, including measurements, furnished for the Solomonic Temple (1 Kgs 5-7); 3) frequent allusion to measurement as a method of divine cosmogenesis (Job 28:25; 38:5; Isa 40:12); and 4) measurement of Jerusalem and the Temple as a feature of prophetic visions (Ezek 40 48; Zech 2). But before the time of Akiba and Ishmael 'merkabah' visions never give exact measurements for the man-like figure enthroned on the merkabah. There were a variety of factors whose timely con currence at the time of our second-generation tannaim were responsi ble for this development. I shall lay out two of them now and leave the others to emerge in their proper contexts. The first was what we have seen was Lucian's suggestion of the increasing prominence of ShQ type information in contemporary visionary settings outside Judaism; it was "in the air." The second factor, within Judaism, was the growth of speculation, clearly visible already in Philo of Alexandria early in the 1st century ce, about the attributes of God, particularly His Justice and His Mercy, and the concomitant semantic evolution of the word םדוח/םדה, "measure(s), dimension(s)," into the technical term for these "attributes." With these divine attributes-that-are-also-dimensions mys tically pictured as the limbs of the body of God, a development already visible in the Epistle to the Ephesians, and with measurement of divine figures becoming increasingly common in contemporary visionary set tings, the evolution of ShQ revelation in Jewish 'merkabah' visions of the man-like figure enthroned on the merkabah was a natural devel opment to occur.34 Of the texts adduced by Gershom Scholem and others in support of the thesis claiming an older-than-the-traditional-gaonic date for the origin of ShQ those which specifically mention measure for God's 34 On this, a subject worth exploring in much greater detail, see (H.-J.)

JACKSON hypostatic form are in full accord with the proposed dating in the course of the late 1st and early 2nd centuries ce for the evolution of ShQ_ShQ_ revelation in Judaism. The exact date of each of these texts is uncertain. This is notoriously true of 2 Enoch 39:6, and it is equally true, to a lesser degree, for Eph 4:13, 16; for the Nag Hammadi archive's Gospel of Philip (NHC II, 3; 62.11-17); and for the Gnostic opponents that Irenaeus (bishop of Lyons late in the 2nd century ce) has in view in his work Against Heresies 4.19.2. But there is a high degree of probability that they all fall within the chronological para meters defined by the vision and original Aramaic book of Elchasai and by the lives of Akiba and Ishmael.30 None of the adduced texts records specific numbers, however, for the measure of which they speak. They may have known texts and/or persons who did so, but they do not themselves provide them. I would suggest that the reason for this is that none of the various contexts in the passages in question is visionary, as is the case in the Book of Elchasai and the ShQ texts of the 'hekhalot' literature. The provision of measurements for a divine figure is not only, from a history-of religions perspective, characteristic of visionary settings, it is also, as I argued earlier, phenomenologically consequential to them, serving the function of authentification furnished by numerical exactitude. This is clearly the situation in the vision of Elchasai, and Fossum is wrong to aver that the measurements given in it are not very likely to be meant literally, but are rather meant only to convey a sense of the otherworldly nature of the two divine beings.36 If this were true, the visionary would not have gone out of his way to include the following: Text 7b And how. .. did I know the measurements? It was because ... I saw from the mountains that [the divine couple's] heads reached up that high, and when I learned the measurement (of the height) 35 For bibliography see note 8. Particularly fulsome discussions of these texts are pro vided by Stroumsa, "Form(s) of God," 284-7, and Morray-Jones, "The Body of the Glory," 45-56; on the passage from 2 Enoch see further Cohen 1.80 responding to Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkauah Mysticism 213. For a succinct presentation of the problems of date and provenance posed by 2 Enoch see F. I. Andersen in The Old Testament Testament Pseudepigrapha (Garden City, NY, 1983) 1.94-7; Andersen {ibid. p. 91) opts for a date late in the 1st century ce. The deutero-Pauline Epistle to the Ephesians is gen erally set in this same time-period (see, e.g., W. G. Kiimmei, Einleitung in das Neue Testament׳,Testament20 ,׳. Aufl.; Heidelberg, 1980 374-5).

The benefit of what was, in this theological position, an implicit claim to a unique visionary experience of perfectly immaterial entities—seeing that which cannot be seen—was offset by the uncomfortable awareness that this uniqueness inevitably entailed the possibility of questioned authen ticity. The numerical measurements are intended to preclude this even tuality with the validating power of their precision. As a result of this, the visionary knew that what we saw happen in the case of Oral Roberts's vision was likely to occur in his own case, that the focus of suspicion or efforts at discreditation would fall, consequently, precisely on the authenticating numbers. The natural way to attack the num bers would be to pose the question that Robert McAfee Brown directs at Oral Roberts's 900-foot measure for his epiphanic Jesus: how exactly had the visionary learned the measurement in the first place, since he could not, as those who measured Pheidias's Zeus had done, have laid a yardstick to the limbs of the divine pair. The visionary's opening question ("And how did I know the measurements?") is designed to forestall this attack. It does not matter that the solution left open the question how, in turn, he learned the height of the surrounding moun tains. They, at least, were both visible and measurable to anyone and everyone. It is interesting to observe that, even though Roberts sug gests that he gauged the height of his epiphanic Jesus in a manner similar to that used by the Elchasaite visionary (Jesus was half again as tall as the 600-foot-tall tower of the City of Faith), his detractors ignore this implicit suggestion of a perfectly sound method of estima tion in their eagerness to pursue their objective of attacking the authen ticating precision of the measurement. 37 Epiphanius, Panarion XXX, 17.7 (1.357.5-7 Holl), omitting Epiphanius's citation formulas ("he says"). The reference to mountains is explained by an earlier, indirect citation that Epiphanius supplies (Panarion XIX, 4.2); there we are informed that in the vision the Holy Spirit (and, doubtless, her male companion as well) was like a statue (extending) above the clouds and stood between two mountains. The comparison to a statue suggests the possibility of influence from cult iconography, which bears interest ing comparison with the earlier discussion of Pheidias's Zeus and the Polycleitan canon; a similar phenomenon is visible in Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Dan 2:3Iff. In the vision of Elchasai, however, the iconographic influence does not appear to extend to the meas urements but seems restricted to the statue-like stance of the figures in the vision.</page><page sequence="26">398 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON It is noteworthy that this potential problem of questioned authen ticityticity could not arise in the ShQ revelations ascribed to Akiba and Ishmael, where the potential problem is equally acute because, as we saw, like Elchasai's invisible divine couple, God is said to be "hidden from all creatures." The need for verification of what is thus an implic itly unique visionary experience of an invisible deity is consequently equally pressing in ShQ revelation in Judaism. But the potential prob lem does not arise there because, as we also saw earlier, though Akiba and Ishmael are said to see God sitting on His throne, just as Micaiah and Isaiah had done, the measurements are revealed to them by an intermediary, Metatron. Metatron thus serves the same role that the tower of the City of Faith served in Oral Roberts's vision and the mountains serve in the vision of Elchasai: he deflects the potential ques tion how exactly the visionaries learned the numbers. In this respect, then, the intermediation of Metatron imposed by the conventions of clas sical Jewish apocalyptic is again fortuitous. Earlier we saw him reliev ing God of the impossible responsibility of revealing the dimensions of His own body; now we can see that his presence has the added benefit of obviating the same problem that the Elchasaite visionary's question in Text 7b poses. The original, awkward, epistemologically problem atic setting of direct vision of God is not, however, abandoned for what might logically, in this case, be a vision that excludes God and becomes a vision solely of Metatron as the source of the ShQ_ revelation about God. The reason this step could not be taken was not merely that it meant abandoning the biblical precedents set by Micaiah and Isaiah. It was doubtless also a matter of the dangerous implications such a displacement would have had in the context of the well-known dithe istic issues raised by hypostatic speculation in Judaism. The biblical visionary setting is thus retained, and it fulfills the requirement of a narrative framework established by the conventions of classical Jewish apocalyptic, but it has atrophied functionally to a bare-bones intro duction to the revelation mediated by Metatron. The question how Metatron, in turn, acquired the ShQ knowledge is not an issue; he is so close to God as dangerously nearly to be God. I shall turn now to the evidence which exists to support what I asserted earlier: that the revelation of divine measurements is an ancient tradition in the Near East. This fact is significant because it means that if the increasing prominence of such revelation in visionary set tings contemporary with the Elchasaite visionary and with Akiba and Ishmael was an influential factor in the evolution of ShQ in Judaism,</page><page sequence="27">399 ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHMJR QOMAH as I argued earlier is likely to have been the case, this influence was all the stronger for having the weight of centuries behind it. The var ious biblical measurement precedents enumerated earlier helped ease this development, and so too did the second factor I argued to have been crucial, the evolution of מרות for the man-like figure of 'merk abah' visions. What further greased the wheels of adoption was the age-old fact of strong cultural influence upon Israelite and, now, Jewish religion from the great civilizations of the Nile and the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys. I begin with Egypt because in its case certainly one and possibly two of the pertinent texts have the divine dimensions revealed in vision ary settings. The first of these texts is that which is popularly called the Dream of Nektanebo(s), though its actual title, which stands at the head of the unique papyrus that preserves it, is (Defense) of Petesis the Hieroglyph-Cutter Hieroglyph-Cutter to King Nektanebos. The papyrus, dated to the early to mid-2nd century bce, was found in the ruins of the famous Serapeum in Memphis; it was copied and owned by one Apollonios, a Greek κάτοχος (temple fanatic) resident there. The document which Apollonios copied is all but certainly a translation or adaptation of a native Egyptian KonigsnovelleKonigsnovelle likely to have originated not long after the flight of its royal subject, Nektanebo(s) II (359-341 bce), the last native ruler of Egypt, and soon after the advent of Greek hegemony, which it may have been intended to justify. Ihe basic outline 01 the story, as lar as Apollonios preserves it, is as follows: on a full moon night in the 16th year of his reign—343 bce,bce, the year in which the Persian king Artaxerxes III (Ochus) is known to have renewed his attack on Egypt, an attack now destined to sue ceed—Nektanebo(s) came to Memphis to sacrifice and to request the deities of the ancient capital to reveal to him what would happen to his country. The king then had a dream in which the god Onouris, identified as equivalent with Greek Ares, complains to Isis that the completion of his temple has been neglected. Isis says nothing, and when he awoke, the king, in a panic, sent for the high priest and the prophet of Onouris's temple in Sebennytos. When the king learned that the hieroglyphic inscriptions remained to be carved in the ady ton, he called an assembly of all the hieroglyph-cutters of the land, and, informed that Petesis was the best of them all, the king commis sioned him to complete the work posthaste. The papyrus breaks off soon hereafter, evidently because Apollonios shared with many of his fellow κάτοχοι in the Memphite Serapeum an interest in dreams since</page><page sequence="28">HOWARD Μ. JACKSON 400 incubation was practiced there, and so he tired of the story once the dream and its immediate aftermath were over.38 It is precisely Nektanebo(s)'s dream that interests us as well. It too seems to have been the product of incubation in one of the temples of Memphis; Apollonios doubtless thought that the site was the Serapeum. Wherever it was the incubation took place, however, its purpose was in any case oneiromantic; the dream was, in other words, the medium for an oracular consultation of the gods. In his dream Nektanebo(s) saw a papyrus boat coming to anchor at Memphis. The boat had a great throne on it, and on the throne sat Isis, the greatly glorious bene factress of humankind and queen of the gods. All the other divinities of Egypt were standing beside her to her right and left. Then Text 8 one of them stepped forward, whose great stature he supposed to be 21 cubits tall, the one called Onouris in Egyptian, but Ares in Greek.39 Onouris prostrates himself before the goddess, and registers his com plaint, evidendy specifically directed against Nektanebo(s) himself. Omi nously enough, Isis, as we saw, answers not a word. The appearance of divinities in dreams is well attested in the Egyptian Konigsnovellen,Konigsnovellen, and sometimes the figure is of superhuman stature. But it is significant that the only other instance in which the sleeper learned something—the text is unfortunately damaged—about the measurement of the height of the divine figure is under similarly desperate military circumstances. The royal dreamer in this second case is Merenptah, some 900 years before Nektanebo(s). On the eve of a crucial batde against a Libyan confederation of the "Peoples of the Sea" Merenptah 38 See particularly U. Wilcken, "Der Traum des Konigs Nektanebos," Melanges Nicole.

The papyrus has ύπελάμβανον ("/ supposed"), which is universally corrected to ύπελάμβανεν ("he . . ."). I have followed suit, but the papyrus's reading might be retained on the grounds that with the description of the dream the third person is abandoned for a more direct and vivid first person. That is the case in other dream-reports from the Serapeum—e.g., in the report of Tages's dream (Wilcken, Urkunden Urkunden da Ptolemaerzeit (altere Funde) 1.354 (#77 col I, lines 1-13), which begins in the 3rd person but shifts to the 1st in the account of the dream itself.</page><page sequence="29">401 ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHMJR QOMAH Text 9 saw in a dream what seemed like an ima[ge] of Ptah standing before Pharaoh, 1. p. h. He seemed in height [...]. He said to him, "Here! Take (this)!" as he gave him the battle-axe. "Now banish fear from your heart!"40 The inscription is damaged at the critical point at which informa tion about the height of the divine figure was given. About two dozen sign-groups have been lost in the lacuna. Whether they included exact numerical measurement cannot be known, but measurement of some sort seems certain, even if, in a fashion similar to the Elchasaite vision ary with his mountains, it was gained by comparison with something else of known height. In the light of the earlier discussion of Pheidias's Zeus (Text 2) and of the likelihood of iconographic influence on the vision of Elchasai (see note 37) it is interesting—though perhaps not very surprising— that the form the god Ptah assumed in Merenptah's dream was that of a cult statue [tw[t], rendered with "ima[gej" in the translation). Since Ptah's cult statue in his ancient temple in Memphis was well known to the king and, obviously, of fixed height, these facts may have encour aged the inclusion of specifics about the height of the divine figure in the dream and may equally have conditioned how tall the figure ap peared to be. Given the Egyptian fondness for colossi, it is not impos sible that Nekhtanebo(s)'s huge 21-cubit Onouris was also modeled upon a larger-than-life cult statue of the divinity in or associated with his temple at Sebennytos. Cult iconography may have helped, but it cannot have been what was responsible for eliciting the revelation of precise data about divine stature in the two royal dreams. Rather, as I suggested earlier, the motivating factor in both instances is more plausibly to be sought in the common ground of the desperate circumstances under which both dreams were had. The nature of the connection between desperate cir cumstances and the revelation of precise measurement for a visionary divinity is not difficult to deduce. The superhuman size of the divini ties conveys, as always, a sense of their power, but the revelation of precise measurement for them functions in a manner comparable to 40 Text: Κ. A.

JACKSON that which we saw at work in the visions of Eukrates and of Elchasai: it furnishes confirmation from mathematical exactitude. The nature of the confirmation the numerical precision lent Eukrates and Elchasai was, as we saw, verification in the face of potential incredulity. In the case of the two royal Egyptian dreams the confirmation provided is different. It is, rather, a matter of certification of divine intervention in a situation of terrible uncertainty, just as it is also in the financial crisis to which Oral Roberts's vision was a divine response. The type of confirmation needed may differ, but it is still, in both situations, a matter of concrete certainty proferred by numerical precision. The Egyptian word mi (literally, "like, resembling"), rendered twice with "seemed" in the excerpt from Merenptah's dream, and, equally, the Greek verb ΰπολαμβάνειν in the passage from Nekhtanebo(s)'s, trans lated with "supposed," do not undermine this conveyance of certainty. The two words function, precisely as Hebrew ~כ does in visionary con texts, to stress the phenomenon of appearance to the senses of the visionary, not lack of certainty on his part. Quite the contrary: there is nothing in the two royal dreams comparable to the words with which Lucian (Text 6) has Eukrates hedge the measurements he gives for the visionary Hekate, and where Eukrates's figures are round numbers, Nekhtanebo(s)'s 21 cubits is precise. It is worth noting, then, that the numbers revealed to the Elchasaite visionary are equally exact. He, too, as we saw, faced a precarious sit uation which demanded offsetting with a validating display of numer ical exactitude: his divine couple were claimed to be invisible, and the content of their revelation was at points radical enough, even within the more freewheeling atmosphere of early tannaitic period Judaism (not to mention early sub-apostolic Christianity), to need all the vision ary support it could get. Significantly, our ShQ texts, too, are similarly exact; at times, like the measurements revealed for the divine couple in the Book of Elchasai, the numbers are precise down to a fraction.41 To be sure, we cannot know whether the same level of precision pre vailed in ShQ revelation at the time of Akiba and Ishmael, and there 41 Fractions (always טליט): Synopse §376 (MS N8128), §697 (MS N8128), §939 (MS M40), §949 (MS M40); Geniza-Fragmente G8 (lb.31-3, reading ו0ליט for the second ושלוש); G9 (6a. 14-5, partly in lacuna). In some of these passages טל׳ט may be partly the prod uct of a desire for hypnotically effective repeated assonance (שלטים ושלוט ושליט vel sim.), but that merely serves to strengthen the precision of the fraction. On the other hand, שליט probably ultimately owes its existence to a pun on טלט in Isa 40:12; see Cohen 1.117.</page><page sequence="31">ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHIcUR QOMAH 403 can be little doubt that the tradition underwent development toward more exacting specificity over the centuries that separate Akiba and Ishmael from the early gaonic period when our ShQtexts assumed their earliest written forms. But one wonders, nevertheless, whether desper ately uncertain circumstances were not, in addition to the factors dis cussed earlier, an additional motivating element in the evolution of ShQ revelation in Judaism late in the 1st and early in the 2nd centuries ce, just as it seems to have been in the two royal Egyptian dreams. The same is equally true of the time at which the Book of Elchasai in its original form was written, since Elchasai's prophecy of doom is to be understood against the background of the Mesopotamian Jewish com munity's having joined the Parthian resistance and then having suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Trajan's lieutenant Lucius Quietus. In Palestinian Judaism of the time posited for the emergence of ShQ revelation the desperate circumstances will have been those brought on by the destruction of the Temple in 70 ce, an event which is actually alluded to in ShQ texts,42 and by the defeats that accompanied the later revolts. In regard to the destruction of the Temple, it is noteworthy that the majority of biblical texts adduced earlier for the presence of measurement in them—and more often than not in this majority it is precise numerical measurement—concern either the desert Tabernacle and its equipment or its successor the Jerusalem Temple, real or vision ary. The evidence attesting to several copies of the Qumran Temple Scroll Scroll demonstrates the continuing vitality of this tradition, with the numbers predictably inflated, for the time period that the copies span, from the 2nd century bce to early in the 1st ce.43 The commissioning of Oral Roberts's City of Faith to divine specifications illustrates its vitality down to the present day. With the destruction of the Temple this tradition of precise measurement in its regard was shifted to the man-like form of God enthroned on the visionary merkabah, to the throne, and to the creatures that support it. The confirmational purpose that this shift under desperate circum stances served was doubtless to serve as compensatory assurance, for 42 Synopse §698 (MSS N8128, 01531, M40), where we are told how many more locks of hair God had before the Temple was destroyed than after. In His grief, He had, no doubt, torn them out. 43 See Y. Yadin, The Temple Scroll (Jerusalem, 1977-1983); J. Maier, The Temple Saoll. An An Introduction, Translation &amp; Commentary (Sheffield, 1985); M. Broshi, "The Gigantic Dimensions of the Visionary Temple in the Temple Scroll," BAR 13.6 (1987) 36-7.

JACKSON 'merkabah' mystics at least, of continuing intimate access to God's abid ing presence despite the calamitous disappearance of the ancient, earthly locus of His self-manifestation, where He had made Himself visible enthroned upon the cherubim. After the destruction of the Temple 'merkabah' visions thus came to serve the purpose of confirming that access to God was still available; only the venue of access to His pres ence has changed from the earthly Temple (where, significantly, late Second Temple traditions record frequent visions of God and his ret inue) exclusively now to the heavenly one, with ascensional vision as the sole surviving means of gaining that access.44 Isaiah's vision—of God on a high and exalted (heavenly) throne but seen, evidently, in the earthly Temple (Isa 6:1, 4, 6)—made this shift from terrestrial to celestial Temple not only a natural one but, with the destruction of the Temple, all the more of a vital one to make. In this light, it is not an accident, then, that Isaiah's vision helped furnish the visionary set ting for the ShQ texts of the 'hekhalot' literature. Not surprisingly, this shift of focus from earth to heaven brought a concomitant change of focus in contemporary Jewish apocalypses which our ShQ texts also reflect: there is less interest in history now and more in unchanging celestial realities. For the apocalypses 2 Baruch and 444 Ezra, closer to the event, the destruction of the Temple is a subject of intense concern. In the later 3 Baruch, however, as equally in our ShQ texts, the disaster is mentioned in passing, but concentration is on the heavenly realia that have replaced it. 3 Baruch consoles itself further with visions of eschatological punishments. But the ShQ tradition's con solation comes from elsewhere: it has replaced the Temple, God's house, with the very body of God, and the latter is reassuringly perfectly known and exactly measured, just as the former had been. It is for this reason that ShQ revelation is a vital, indeed the culminating expe rience of the 'merkabah' mystics after the destruction of the Second Temple: it reflects and enshrines an intimate contact with God and a precise knowledge of His Person. 44 The posited shift of measurement tradition in a visionary and/or liturgical setting from earthly Temple to heavenly Temple is part of a more general shift of focus from the one to the other after the destruction of the Second Temple: see, e.g., J. Maier, VomVom Kultus zw Gnosis.

These new texts are of a a genre quite different from the dream-visions of Nekhtanebo(s) and Merenptah. I shall address the subject of their genre momentarily and, later, discuss its relevance for ShQ revelation in Judaism. For the pre sent it is important to note that the texts I cite of this new genre are merely a sample; doubdess, an exhaustive search would turn up oth ers. Those I cite are sufficient to demonstrate, however, how pervasive and deeply rooted the theologoumenon of divine measurement was in ancient Egyptian culture. Small wonder, then, that, under suitably des perate circumstances, the two pharaohs, almost a millenium apart, should find it haunting their dreams! Some of the new texts are intended for the living and some are intended for the dead, but they all belong as a group to the genre of "magic" texts. Their purpose, in other words, is to effect a certain desired state of affairs through an act of ritual power. The group for the dead are "chapters" from the so-called Book of the Dead; significantly, they are all spells designed to ensure the deceased a successful entry into the Field of Rushes, the ancient Egyptian paradise, in the face of impeding dangers. About the Field of Rushes, where the god Horus appears as a falcon 1000 cubits long, we are told that things are preter naturally large there: Text 10 the barley is 5 cubits tall, its ears 2 cubits, and its stalks 3 cubits; the wheat is 7 cubits (tall), its ears 3 cubits, and its stalks 4 cubits. It is the blessed spirits of the dead {3hw), each 9 cubits tall, who reap them beside (or, in the presence of) the souls of the Easterners (i.e., the gods of the eastern horizon).45 In a fashion similar to the greater-than-now-normal height reported for heroes of a bygone age by Philostratus's pious Greek vinedresser (Text 5), the blessed Egyptian dead have grown into giants, enjoying a stature several times greater than that which they had possessed during their earthly lives. The spells for the living are equally designed to conjure up a reality threatened by hostile forces, only here it is protection against the surreptitious attack of deadly creatures, in the first instance of 5י The 1 OOO-cubit Horus: "chapter" 110 (A, line 15 in E. A. W. Budge, The Chapters of of Coming Forth by Day or the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead; London, 1910; 2.95); the translated passage: "chapter" 109 (lines 7-9 in Budge, ibid., 92). Similar passages appear in "chapter" 149 (II, lines 2-5, 11-4; and V, line 2, in Budge, ibid., 271-3).</page><page sequence="34">406 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON crocodiles and in the second of scorpions. In the crocodile spell the protective power of a great dwarf-god (Ptah, often shown in this form) is invoked. His gigantic body is said to reach from the sky to the under world. When the god commands that a tiny shrine half a cubit high be built for him, the spell-binder responds: Text 11 You will not be able to enter the shrine half a cubit (high), because you are a giant (nht) 7 cubits (tall).44 All All the same, we are told, the god has no trouble entering the shrine and resting in it. The setting of the scorpion spell, for its part, has the god Horus traveling with his brother (evidently Seth) when, bitten by a scorpion, he calls out to Horus for help. The rest of the spell is largely taken up with Horus's—i.e., the spell-binder's—efforts to get the bitten brother—i.e., the human patient of the spell-binder—to reveal his secret name, so that by recitation of it the spell to expel the poi son may succeed. The divine patient refuses to tell his name, however, repeatedly offering self-identifications which Horus rejects for not being the real secret name; among these is Text 12a [I am] a man millions (hhw) of cubits (tall), whose nature (or, appearance) is not known. When the divine sufferer finally reveals the secret name it is with the statement Text 12b I am a man millions of cubits (tall); "Day of Health" is his name.47 The secret name reflects, and thus theurgically ensures, achievement of the desired state. One might well ask what relevance texts so far removed culturally and chronologically from the 'hekhalot' literature might have for ShQ revelation in Judaism. The shared element of precise, often gigantically 46 Text (in a hieratic papyrus of 19th-20th Dynasty date) with German translation and commentary: H. O.

In fact, however, it is not coincidence: it is the genre that ties the two groups of texts together, and perhaps, even, ties them together historically. It is by no means out of the question, in other words, that the phe nomenon of ShQtype revelation which is attested in the cited Egyptian "magic" texts had a role to play in the evolution of the same phe nomenon in Judaism. The reason this is a possibility is because the goal of 'merkabah' visionary experience in the 'hekhalot' literature is so regularly theur gic—that is, angelic adjuration is so frequently employed to effect the realization of human objectives threatened, as in the Egyptian spells, by impediment from superior and potentially hostile forces—that one could, if one wanted to, categorize the 'hekhalot' texts themselves as "magic" texts.48 In this respect, then, the 'hekhalot' literature and the Egyptian spells are typologically identical. But when one considers Egyptian "magic" literature from the period contemporary with the early evolution of the traditions embodied in the 'hekhalot' literature and with the tannaim to whom it ascribes its content, the common ground becomes much more than merely typological. Together with other Jewish "magic" texts, the 'hekhalot' literature shares so many elements in common with contemporary Egyptian "magic" texts, both in λεγόμενα and in δρώμενα, that it is clear the two so actively cross pollinated each other as to justify viewing them both as a single hybrid produced by the common soil of a Mediterranean and Near Eastern theurgic koine.*9 It is not out of the question, consequently, that the evolution of ShQ revelation in Judaism was aided by what phenomenologically speaking is the same element in Egyptian contexts of similarly theurgic function. If it was indeed the case, as I hypothesized earlier, that after the des traction of the Second Temple the vital function of the 'merkabah' 48 See, e.g., Schafer, Der verborgene und ojfenbare Gott (as n. 5), 146-53; idem, "Jewish Magic Literature in Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages," JJS 41, (1990) 75-91; idem, "The Aim and Purpose of Early Jewish Mysticism" (as n. 27). 49 See Smith, "Observations on Hekhalot Rabbati" (as n. 28) 142-60; Scholem, Jewish.

JACKSON visionary experience became to assure continuing intimate access to God, and ShQrevelation, as the newly-introduced central feature of the experi ence, served to enshrine the precise knowledge of God's Person that flowed from that intimate contact with Him, it was only natural that that knowledge should be exploited for its effective potential. The cou pling of epithets connoting God's greatness and power which we saw exemplified in Deut 10:17 and Ps 147:5 made this exploitation of precise knowledge of God's greatness for the purpose of human em powerment an inherently logical conjunction and, virtually, served to underwrite it. One can better understand, in this light, why the two biblical texts play such important roles in the ShQ tradition. But what prompted this new theurgic orientation to begin with lies in another direction. The 'merkabah' visionary experience had origi nally been subordinated to the more purely didactic or kerygmatic objective that is characteristic of the classical Jewish apocalyptic setting in which 'merkabah' mysticism evolved, but with the destruction of the Temple and the disastrous defeats in the revolts that followed it the objective of the visionary ascent became, not surprisingly, less collec five and more individual, more personal. The new theurgic orientation of the visionary ascent represents a development parallel to the increas ingly personal soteriology of Jewish apocalyptic texts after the destruc tion of the Temple where earlier, before the destruction, it had been more communal. Ihe new theurgic onentation was also a logical step to take: it was only natural that an increasingly disenfranchised and marginalized Jewish community both in the Roman and, somewhat later under the Sasanids, in the Persian worlds should seek redress in recourse to acts of ritual empowerment. An increasingly disenfranchised and marginalized "pagan" community did the same with its Neoplatonic theurgy based on the Chaldean Oracles. It is not a coincidence that Iamblichus is intimately associated with this Neoplatonic theurgy and that, in Text lb above, we saw him expounding what amounts to a Hellenized form of .SArevelation. It is one stripped, in other words, of its numbers, but it serves, nevertheless, the same theurgic ends. The implications of this discussion are that a theurgic purpose is likely to have been present, to some extent or other, from the earliest stages of the emergence of ShQ_ revelation as an objective of 'mer kabah' visionary ascent and that it does not represent a stricdy later, much less a decadent stage in its development. It may have become a more prominent focus as time wore on, with the result that the 'hekhalot' texts in their current forms have become largely liturgical</page><page sequence="37">ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHIcUR QOMAH 409 guides to obtaining 'merkabah' visions toward often exclusively theur gic ends. But for the historical and social reasons outlined above a theur gic orientation is likely to have been already a factor at the time of initial introduction of ShQ revelation into 'merkabah' mystical contexts. To find ShQ revelation in theurgic contexts, whether Jewish, Neopla tonic, or classical Egyptian, is hardly surprising. It is not an accident that numbers play so consistently large a role in the "magic" litera tures of all ancient cultures. Mathematical precision serves a function there similar to that which it serves in the various visionary contexts that we examined earlier: it "makes certain." The effected certainty is not, in this case, confirmational, as it is in the earlier settings, but rather executive; the numerical exactitude is a means toward achiev ing the theurgic goal. In order to bend a superior power to one's will one needs precise knowledge and scrupulous observance of its nature: the exact name must be pronounced, the right preparations must be made, the correct materials must be used, the requisite ritual must be punctiliously enacted. It is a natural surmise, then, that as a theurgic objective became an increasingly preponderant focus of the 'hekhalot' literature and of the 'merkabah' visionary exercise which it reports, SkQ revelation is likely to have grown in tandem with that develop ment, evolving from what probably more closely resembled the num ber, size, and type of dimensions given in the vision of Elchasai (Text 7a) to the great diversity, gigantic size, and exacting precision of the information we are given in ShQ revelation in the 'hekhalot' texts in their current form. The two processes, greater theurgic orientation and expanded ShQ revelation, go hand in hand. We see a parallel num ber-inflation in a theurgic context being taken to its limits in the man millions millions of cubits tall in the ancient Egyptian scorpion spell (Texts 12a and b). 1 shall turn now to presenting the evidence which exists to show that measurements given for superhuman figures was equally an ancient tradition in Mesopotamia, and I shall conclude with a discussion of the influence this tradition exerted on the evolution of ShQ revelation in Judaism. The genre to which the Mesopotamian texts in question belong is neither visionary nor "magic," as has been true of all the texts discussed since Lucian's Eukrates (Text 6). They pertain, rather, to the nexus of royal ideological traditions that, by one means or another, claimed divine parentage for ancient Mesopotamian kings. The first text is the victory monument of the pre-Sargonid Sumerian king Eannatum of Lagash (c. 2500 bce) known as the "Stele of the</page><page sequence="38">410 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON Vultures." The passage on it that interests us is that in which Eannatum describes his divine fore-ordination, from his very conception, to obtain the victory that the stele celebrates. The prior events which necessi tated Eannatum's divinely commissioned conception, birth, and appoint ment to the kingship were, the king tells us, as follows. The city of Umma had encroached upon territory belonging to Lagash and had long been belligerently rebuffing efforts of kings of Lagash to regain access to the sacred lands within it which supplied the offerings for the Lagashite temple of the storm-god Ningirsu. Incensed, Eannatum goes on to inform us, Ningirsu formulated the plan of engendering Eannatum in order to have, in him, a champion to attack and defeat Umma and thereby to force it to cede the god's sacred lands back to Lagash. Ningirsu plants the seed of the future Eannatum in the womb of the mother-goddess Baba, and in due course Eannatum is born. He is dan died, named, and breast-fed by the goddesses Inanna and Ninhursaga. Then, evidently referring now to the time after which he had grown to manhood, Eannatum declares of himself: Text 13a Over Eannatum, the seed implanted in the womb by Ningirsu, Ningirsu rejoiced. Ningirsu laid upon him his span, laid upon him his cubit, even (up to) five cubits, (making) five cubits and one span. Delighted that, at a measured five and a half cubits tall, his son has attained a stature to match his divine parentage, Ningirsu appoints him king of Lagash and bestows upon him an appropriately bellicose name that promises him renown in heaven and on earth. When the time comes to attack Umma, Eannatum is given the go-ahead by Ningirsu in a dream, and, through his champion, Text 13b [u]pon the city ruler of Umma he (viz., Ningirsu) put from Heaven his great hands and great feet. It is a slaughter, and, though wounded himself, Eannatum is victorious.50 In his comments Thorkild Jacobsen notes that on the Stele of the 50 Text and translation of the monument, with commentary: T.

This misses the point. Moreover, to judge from the translation offered by Heinrich Otten in his article cited later in note 53, it is based on a failure to appreciate the true import of the words rendered by Jacobsen with "even (up to) five cubits." These words are not intended to represent, as Jacobsen and others take them to do, a preliminary total of the number of cubits Eannatum measured, with the sum total of cubits and spans following, in which case the number of cubits would thus be awkwardly repeated. Rather, with the inserted "(up to)" dropped, the words mean that each of Ningirsu's cubits, the length of the god's forearm, was equal to five human cubits. Eannatum did not mean, then, the five and a half cubits he measured at the hands of Ningirsu to be taken for his actual height. In the royal ideology of divine parentage they constitute the "proof" of Eannatum's divine appointment, from conception, to the heroic task of taking back the god's lands from Umma. It emerges clearly from Text 13b's reference to Ningirsu's great hands and feet that the under lying assumption of the words "even five cubits" is the by now famil iar one that divinities are much bigger than human beings, in this case five times as big, and the measuring of Eannatum is designed to assure Ningirsu that his human son "measures up" to the task for which Ningirsu had engendered him. The five and a half divine cubits that Eannatum measures are purely ideological; they are (literally!) self aggrandizing propaganda. They are more a measure of the god Ningirsu's own superhuman stature, in other words, than they are of the actual Eannatum. The royal Mesopotamian ideology of divine parentage was not orig inally intended to be anything more than metaphor in the service of royal megalomania,52 and Eannatum's self-glorifying reference to his and and Character (Chicago &amp; London, 1963), 310-3; J.

JACKSON measurement at the hands of his "father" Ningirsu cannot have been intended to be taken literally, no matter how exceptionally tall he may actually have been. But as time wore on and the ancient kings who applied this ideology to themselves receded into the ancient past, leg ends began to take the claim of divine parentage and, with that, the tradition of their superhuman stature much more literally than con temporaries of Eannatum ever could have done. We see this develop ment occurring in a fragment of the Hittite version of the Epic of Gilgamesh, a version developed from a Middle Babylonian original dat ing to the first half of the second millenium bce and consequendy long after Eannatum's time. The Epic remembers that Gilgamesh was only two-thirds god, the other third of him being human, but it has for gotten what the Sumerian King List knew, that the reason Gilgamesh was part human was that he had had a human being, not a god, for a father. In the late recension of the Epic, however, he has two divine parents, and he has thus become there what he had already become in cult by the time of Eannatum: a god. Eannatum, too, as we saw, claims fully divine parentage, but what Eannatum merely claims for himself Gilgamesh has had accorded to him by a heroic tradition bent upon lionizing him. After recounting the elements that various divinities contributed to his make-up and, it seems, in place of the statement that two-thirds of him was god and one-third human, the Hittite fragment of the Epic informs us: Text 14 The form of Gilgamesh the great gods [made surpassing]. Eleven cubits [was his height]; the breadth of his chest was nine [spans]. The length of his [...] was three(?)

On the Hittite ver sion of the Gilgamesh Epic see Tigay, ibid., 111-8.</page><page sequence="41">ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHIcUR QOMAH 413 ityity to see if he "measures up." In Gilgamesh's case we have a situation comparable to that set up by the polarity between divine grandeur and delimiting human measure discussed earlier in the contexts of Pausanias's condemnation of human measurement of Pheidias's Zeus (Text 2) and of Metatron's intermediation in ShQ revelation: where Eannatum had had a divine yardstick in the form of Ningirsu's forearm laid to his limbs, the measurements are simply revealed for Gilgamesh, with the Epic itself playing the role of the intermediary. This is because Gilgamesh's claim to divinity is no longer, as it was in Eannatum's case, merely an ideology, but a fact. In a fashion similar to the process that led to the conviction with which Philostratus's pious vinedresser could retail his stories of the superhuman height of ancient Greek demi-gods (Text 5), Gilgamesh has been elevated to the actual possession of status which kings of pre-Sargonid Sumeria had only dared to boast for themselves. And with this elevation has come, inevitably, the developments which I posited as likely to have equally occurred in the evolution of ShQ revelation in Judaism. There is an inflation of Gilgamesh's stature to what is, suspiciously enough, exactly double that of the base figure given by Eannatum, and there is an expansion of the features meas ured from only what we saw is the crucial element in ShQ revelation, the overall height, to include, in addition, the breadth of his chest and the length of some other part of his body lost in the lacuna where the tablet begins to break off. We cannot trace the stages and forms in which this ancient Mesopo tamian tradition of measurement of the superhuman size of kings-who are-sons-of-gods reached late antiquity. But I do not think there can be any doubt that, in whatever way and form, it did reach late antiq uity and that, just as I hypothesized to have been the case with the comparable Egyptian traditions, it too influenced the evolution of ShQ revelation in Judaism. The close parallels between the Mesopotamian texts and the vision of Elchasai (Text 7a), which, as we saw, is as tied to Mesopotamia as Ezekiel's prototypical 'merkabah' vision, are hardly likely to be merely coincidental. The subjects of the revealed measure ment are, crucially, on both sides kings and on both sides sons of god. The Elchasaite female Holy Spirit is, in this light, a tacit acknowl edgement of the fact that Mesopotamian divinities come in syzygies. What has happened in the interim, of course, is the disappearance of native monarchies in Jewish as equally in Mesopotamian cultural set tings, so that now the king and son of god has become a purely celes tial appointee, not an earthly one. There is also agreement in that the</page><page sequence="42">414 HOWARD Μ. JACKSON measurements of Gilgamesh and of Elchasai's Son of God both begin with the overall height, move next to the breadth, and then proceed on to other body-parts. And there is more. Like their Israelite counterparts אמה and זרח, the Sumerian cubit and span are both units of measure based on the size of a part of the human body (length of the forearm and spread of the fingers, respectively). As we saw, it was consequently impossible for Eannatum, sharing as he did the universal ancient Near Eastern view that divinities are much larger than human beings, to hold the god Ningirsu's cubit and span to be merely identical to those of humans in length. Eannatum furnishes a formula of conversion from human units into divine ones, and it is interesting to note that the ShQ texts of the 'hekhalot' literature, some three thousand years later, do the same. In frequently cited passages they assure the reader, adducing Isa 40:12 as a proof-text, that God's cubit, span, and handbreadth vastly exceed those of human beings in length.04 The fact that two different strains of tradition are preserved in these passages demonstrates its importance. And no wonder, for the tension, discussed earlier, between the limitless grandeur of God and the reductionist limitation imposed on Him by numbers becomes unbearable when it is a question of units of measure derived from the limbs of the body, when the yardstick for measuring the divine body, in other words, becomes, in effect, the divine body itself. Hence, God's span and God's handbreadth must, as we are told, "fill the whole world." It may well be the case, then, that not only did the Mesopotamian tradition of revealed measurement for superhuman entities have a hand in the development of ShQ revelation in Judaism, so too also did the Mesopotamian solution to the problem posed by the application of units of measure based on the miniscule human body to the enormous stature of divinities. In both traditions it is essentially a question of the same solution proposed for the same units of measure, only three thou sand years' worth of inflation in orders of magnitude has taken place: where Eannatum's Ningirsu is only a modest five times larger than human beings, the ShQ texts' Yahweh is a whole universe larger. The only reason that the conversion problem does not emerge in the Mesopotamian vision of Elchasai is that the unit of measure used there, the σχοινίον (rendered with "furlong" in the translation of Text 7a), 54 Synapse §482 (MS M22), §703 (MSS N8128, 01531, M40), §950 (MS M40); Geniza Fragments G9 (6a.34-6, partly in lacuna).</page><page sequence="43">ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHI'UR QOMAH 415 ultimately represents, as it does in the LXX, the Hebrew חבל, a length of rope used to measure distance and equivalent to 50 cubits. The σχοινίον is not grounded in the human body, then, and so the prob lem has been avoided, no doubt purposefully, in the vision of Elchasai. The use of the σχοινίον/^□!!, thus represents an adjunct solution to the problem in that a unit of measure is chosen that is far beyond the scale of the human body. It is interesting, in this light, that, in the parasang (the Persian mile), the ShQ texts uniformly use a unit of meas ure which, though typically inflated in size, is nevertheless comparable to the σχοινίον/חבל, both in not being based on the human body and in being larger-than-life in human terms. In the cited ShQ passages the parasang is included in the solution, but what posed the problem to begin with was the cubit, the span, and the handbreadth, all firmly rooted in the human arm. I shall end my study here. But, obviously, the story does not end with the emergence of ShQ revelation in Jewish 'merkabah' mysticism early in the tannaitic period. The tradition continued to develop in the period between the late 1st to early 2nd centuries ce, when it first emerges, and the gaonic period, during which the ShQ texts of the 'hekhalot' literature arrived at their current forms. The sheer number of documents from this later period which attest ShQ revelation for one entity or another is large, so large, indeed, that one might justifiably label the later part of the period—that is, the early Middle Ages—the Golden Age of ShQ, revelation. I shall address these later texts in a sec ond study. Those which I have adduced for this earlier phase are fewer, and they cover a much longer span of time. As I remarked earlier of the Egyptian "magic" texts, an intensive search would doubdess turn up more of them, but not, I think, many more outside of Egyptian "magic": the tradition of divine measurement, both in visionary and in theurgic settings, is likely to have remained largely oral and, so, sub literary. The result of this paucity of evidence is a situation not unlike observing a pod of whales: they surface occasionally, but one is never sure whether it is the same whale each time. Still, one knows that it is the same pod swimming in the same sea, and I think, consequendy, that, despite the paucity of evidence, what I have presented and dis cussed is sufficient to suggest that the origins and early development of divine measurement revelation in Judaism is such as I have described it here.</page></plain_text>
