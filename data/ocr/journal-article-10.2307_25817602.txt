<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHANN STRAUSS THE RISE OF NON-MUSLIM HISTORIOGRAPHY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY After the emergence and consolidation of Ottoman historiography in the 16th century, the writing of general Ottoman history seemed, for a long time, to be the exclusive domain of Muslim chroniclers or Western scholars who tried to catch up with them. The historiographical output of the non-Muslim subjects of the empire in their respective languages was to remain remarkably small until the 18th century. Unlike their illustrious late Byzantine predecessors,1 non-Muslim his toriographers were now mainly concerned with local or ecclesiastical af fairs. This development may be explained by the brain drain after the conquest of Constantinople and the ensuing decline in the standards of learning and education among the non-Muslim population, but it seems to be much more due to the lack of patronage, an essential condition and in centive for the activity of a historian. The situation changed in the late 17th and early 18th century with the emergence of new flourishing cul tural centres in the periphery of the empire, in the semi-independent Da nubian principalities, in the entourage of the local rulers, the Hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia. This environment was particularly attractive for what the natives used to call 'Greeks from Istanbul', commonly known as Phanariots,2 whose cultural and later political influence became predominant from 1711 onwards, when the Porte began to appoint almost exclusively members of this community as rulers. The principalities had a certain tradition of native annalists who - ini tially in Slavonic - recorded in their chronicles (letopisef) mainly the events concerning their home-countries, but not unfrequently also refer ring to the history of the adjacent areas.3 The interest in the historical past of their overlords, the Ottoman sultans, whom they still used to refer to as 'emperor' (imparat [in Rumanian] or vasilevs [in Greek]) in the Byzan 1 - See Runciman, Sir Stephen, "Byzantine historians and the Ottoman Turks", in: Historians of the Middle East, Lewis, B. and Holt, P.M.

On the historiography of this period see Piru, Al., Istoria literaturii romdne de la originipina la 1830, Bucharest, 1977, p. 89-147. OM, n.s.

However, at least one biographical collection of that kind is already known from the 17th century.4 Due to the special status of the principalities, Ottoman-Turkish influ ence was rather insignificant there. Consequently, the sources used by the chroniclers were, apart from older local chronicles, mainly western. The two major Moldavian chroniclers of the 17th century, for instance, Gri gore Ureche (ca. 1590-ca. 1646) and Miron Costin (1633-1691) had been trained in Polish colleges and drew heavily on Polish and Latin sources. The new generation of Phanariot intellectuals, evidently more cosmo politan and versatile, came from a different background. Most of them had studied in the academies of the Phanar in Istanbul and in Italy before moving to the Principalities. They were also increasingly attracted by the Russian empire which was to become the most formidable neighbour of the Ottomans in the 18th century.5 Due to their vast experience, these writers, poets, clergymen and government officials did not remain unaf fected by the great currents of the period, especially Italian humanism. As to historiography, however, Byzantine models were particularly con spicuous and the biographical method and the tradition of the chrono graphia maintained its influence. The impact of Islamic culture, dominant in the capital of the empire, is more difficult to assess. The problem is closely connected with the knowl edge of the Ottoman language. Most of these writers, who had often been in the service of high Ottoman dignitaries, certainly knew Turkish but apart from exceptional figures like Demetrius Cantemir (1673-1723), not too many were familiar with the literary language. The study of this language always seems to have been a problem. Special schools for non-Muslims were often in a precarious position and despite many informal contacts it was difficult to find a suitable instructor (hoca). Furthermore, those who had mastered the difficulties like the Greek Grand Dragomans of Porte, were somewhat jealous of their mo 4 - The manuscript from the Moldavian monastery of Casjn contains biographies of 29 Ottoman sultans from Osman to Mehmed IV. It was edited by N. Iorga in 1915.

Milescu had been for a while kapukethuda of Wallachia and later dragoman in Istanbul (1660-64). In 1671 he emigrated to Russia where he spent the rest of his life. Tsar Alexius Mikhailovitch (1645-1676) sent him on a dip lomatical mission to China. The fruits of this activity were four geographical and historical works which made him into an internationally recognised authority on Far Eastern affairs.

At Brancovan's insistence, the Cretan monk Jeremias Cacavelas, one of Demetrius Cantemir's tutors, had translated an anonymous Italian work on the Siege of Vienna by the "utterly treacherous and godless Mussulmans" into Greek as early as 1686 and presented it to Constan tine's predecessor and uncle ?erban Cantacuzene.11 One of Brancovan's boyars, the clucer Afendouli, who had been sent as a diplomatic agent to Bender with the serasker ismail Pa?a, wrote in Greek a "Partial history of 6 - A criticism which was made in the 19th century by the Ottoman scholar Alexan der Konstantinidis in the preface of his 'OOcQfiavitcrj Xpnaro/xdOeia [Ottoman chre stomathy], Istanbul 1871, p. 10: ?... they apparently considered the Turkish a sort of family property?. 7 - Cf.

He was appointed serasker of the Ottoman forces operating against the Russians on the Pruth in 1789. But after having sustained a number of defeats, he was executed by order of Selim III. Manolaki Persiano (or Persiany), Mavroyeni's cdminar (who became later dragoman to Yusuf Agah Efendi's embassy to London) left a brief description of the ?heroic combats of my very high, pious and victorious master Nicolas Mavroyeni (1786-89)?

The procedure is reminiscent of that of the Toledo school of translators: the Ottoman text, dictated by the divan efendisi Bekta?, was first translated into Greek by a dragoman and this version was conse quently corrected by a stylistically well-versed "grammarian".13 Since troops from the principalities had to accompany the Ottoman armies in their campaigns, it provided the opportunity for the writing of eye-witnesses' accounts by members of these contingents. This was, for example, the case of the campaign in the Peloponnese in 1715, of which there is an account in Rumanian. A short chronicle (in Greek) of the joint Moldavo-Tatar campaign under Michael Racovija in 1716-1717 was not only translated into Rumanian but even into Ottoman-Turkish under the title Vekayi-i Eflak.u Many more chronicles either in Greek or Rumanian, often written with the purpose of glorifying the ruling families in the principalities, could be mentioned for the 18th century. The tradition of local chronicles in the vernacular language eventually came to an end and Greek took its place. Historical accounts of this kind, composed in languages little known outside south-eastern Europe like Greek or Rumanian had, however, no major impact despite their undoubted usefulness as a historical source for Ottoman history. Some of them contain valuable material from Ottoman sources, descriptions of Istanbul or translations of fermans and other offi cial documents. Although the facilities for publication had been existing in the principalities,15 none of these chronicles appeared in print. The manuscripts were accessible only to a limited number of persons and their content remained virtually unknown in the West. Demetrius Cantemir and his Incrementa atque decrementa Aulae Oth manicae Western scholars interested in first-hand accounts of Ottoman History by indigenous historians had to wait until 1734 when Demetrius Cantemir's History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire, written around 1716 and - wisely enough - in Latin became available for a western readership thanks to the care of his son Antioch (1708-1744) and the 12 - See Iona?cu, Ion, "Despre cronicarul Afenduli din Jara Romaneasca" [On the chronicler Afendouli from Wallachia], in: Studii.

Tindal's English translation.16 It was greeted there with en thusiasm, very much like the news of the first Ottoman printing press founded by ibrahim Muteferrika at the same period.17 It seemed as if the historiography of the Ottoman empire had suddenly acquired a new quality. Previous attempts of western scholars to collect - sometimes in a rather painstaking way - from various Oriental sources the necessary data on the history of the Ottoman empire appeared in comparison to Cantemir's "History" as second hand and outdated. Wil liam Jones wrote that it "far surpasses, in authority and method, every work on the same subject in any European dialect" and that "it is almost needless to say [...] that Cantemir's history renders the compilations of Knolles and Rycaut entirely useless".18 Not everybody would agree with this judgement today. However, this high esteem was justified mainly by the fact that Cantemir was regarded as a sort of native historian who had drawn his knowledge "from the fountain head" since, as William Jones said, "the justest description of the Asiatic manners must necessarily be given by these, who besides a com plete acquaintance with Oriental literature, have the advantage of a long residence in the East".19 Demetrius Cantemir, who had spent 22 years in the Ottoman capital, was very familiar with Asiatic manners, indeed. Thanks to his position, he had become acquainted with Ottoman poets, artists and grand viziers. His scholarly interest included even Islamic re ligion which he described in a way no non-Muslim in the Ottoman em pire had ever tried before him.20 16 - The History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire, London, 1734-35.

The Moldavian prince was instructed in the Otto man language by a hoca with exceptional qualities, the polymath and translator of Aristotle's "Physics", Hoca Es'ad Efendi ('Saadi effendi'), a member of the Grecophone Muslim community of Janina,21 who also taught several other prominent non-Muslims like the Hospodar John Mavrocordato and the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Chrysanthos Notaras.22 The second acquaintance, the hitherto unidentified Saadi Effendi from Larissa (Turkish Yeni?ehir) provided Cantemir with the framework for his book, a 'synopsis' of Ottoman history. This synopsis must have been, however, rather poor despite Can temir's assertions that it was compiled from the works of older chroni clers like Ne?ri, Saadeddin, Pe9evi and Hezarfenn. The critical observa tions made by Joseph von Hammer,23 the first scholar able to compete with him, do not allow us to suppose that Cantemir had studied these Ot toman chroniclers himself, given the numerous mistakes or omissions of events recorded by them.24 On the other hand, certain remarks on Otto man historiography show that he did not have either a very good opinion of,25 or a very deep insight into, Ottoman historiographical writing.26 21 - The Ottoman sources for 'Yanyali' Hoca Esad are quoted in Ergun, Sadeddin Nuzhet, Turk$airleri, 3 vols., Istanbul, 1936-45, III, p. 1340-1341 . 22 - See Matei, Ion, "Le maitre de langue turque de Dimitrie Cantemir: Es'ad Efendi", in: Revue des etudes sud-est europeennes, X/2 (1972), p. 281-288.

F. Babinger's article, "Die osmanischen Quellen Dimitrie Kan temir's" (definitive version in Zeki Velidi Togan'a Armagan, Istanbul, 1951, p. 50 60) is now outdated. In an interesting study, a Rumanian scholar after having com pared Cantemir's account on ?eyh Bedreddin with seven Ottoman sources comes to the conclusion ?... la relation de Demetre Cantemir sur cet episode tragique de l'histoire ottomane n'a aucune valeur scientifique; elle ne peut pas etre une source historique?, Constantin, G.I., "L'episode du Cheikh Bedr ed-Din d'apres Demetre Cantemir.

Among these critics were not only orien tal scholars like Joseph de Guignes (1721-1800).27 Edward Gibbon (1737-1794) with his unequalled knowledge of the Byzantine sources found him "guilty of strange blunders in oriental history",28 too. But Cantemir wrote his "History" under difficult circumstances in exile, after having left behind his private library in Istanbul. There can be no doubt, however, that the most valuable part of Cantemir's History consists of his notes, an extraordinary source, especially for biographical data based on the author's observations of his contemporaries.29 They have no equiva lent in Ottoman historiography, with the exception, perhaps, of Evliya Celebi.30 Ienachifa Vacarescu and his Istorie a preaputernicilor inparaji otho mani(7 755-7 794). The qualities of Cantemir's "History" become more evident if we com pare it to a similar attempt made by a compatriot some 70 years later. Like the European states the Danubian Principalities were in need of skilled translators for their dealings with the Porte, and therefore began to send gifted young people to Istanbul to join their diplomatic agents (kapukethiida) and to acquire a sound knowledge of the Ottoman lan guage.31 The young hoyar Ienache (or Ienachija) Vacarescu was taught ries from our Christians, not without risking their lives? (ibid.). It may be interesting to note that some of these allegedly inaccessible chronicles (those of the vak'aniivises Naima and Risjd) were among the first books printed by Ibrahim Miiteferrika some twenty years after the publication of the "System" (also see n. 40). 27 - He is the author of the famous Histoire generate des Huns, des Turcs, des Mon gols et des autres Tartares occidentaux...., Paris, 1756-58.

The candidates had to pass an examination in Greek with the Grand chancellor (vel vornic) Vacarescu. Due to the following events, the exile of Ienachi{a Vacarescu and the Russo-Ottoman war of 1787-1792 ending with Mavroyeni's execution, this project was, however, never implemented (Matei, op. cit., p. 104).</page><page sequence="8">224 Johann Strauss Ottoman grammar (sarj) during an exile in Istanbul (1763-67) by a future grand-vizier, ispartah Halil Hamid Pa?a (1736-1788)32 who had served for a while as secretary to Stavraki (oglu), the kapukethuda of Walla chia.33 Like other persons we are dealing with here, Ienachi|a Vacarescu is not only known as a writer, poet and linguist34 but he also held impor tant offices in the service of the Hospodars.35 Here, too, exile seems to have been a fertile ground for history writ ing.

According to his own words, he was born "during the reign of Sultan Mahmud [I (1730-1754)]". When his father was poisoned by order of Constantine Racovita, the * Wallachian Nero', in 1763 he sought refuge in Istanbul. After his return in 1767 he was to hold important offices like those of vistier, spdtar, vornic, grand ban and cai macam. During the Russo-Turkish War (1770-1774) he fled to Kronstadt (Bra?ov) in Transylvania, where he was presented to the future Emperor Joseph II. He was on particularly good terms with the then Wallachian Hospodar Alexander Ypsilanti whom he accompanied to Istanbul (1744) and who entrusted him with the preparation of his famous Code of Laws (Syntagmation Nomikon - Pravilniceasca condicd) printed in Greek and Rumanian in 1780. As a diplomatic agent he was sent on several mis sions to Vienna. Opposed to Nicolas Mavroyeni's pro-Ottoman stance during the conflict with Austria and Russia, he was exiled to Nikopolis in 1788 and later to Rhodes and Edirne. He returned to Wallachia in 1791 and died - perhaps from poison - in Bucharest 12 July 1797. For a very personal account of his life see "La vie d'Enachitza Vacarescu, historien et poete, par son arriere petite-fille Helene Va carescu", in: Revista Scriitorilor Romdni, II (Munich, 1963), p. 5-46. 36 - Istorie a prea puternicilor inpdra\i othomani [i.e.: History of the All-Powerful Ottoman Emperors, collected and described briefly by Sieur Iannache Vacdrescul, Dikaiophylax of the Great Eastern Church and Spatharius of Wallachia.

The sections of the Istorie until 1757 are very close to the tra ditional biographies of Sultans. The second, in many respects more inter esting part, has autobiographical character. Although the writer seems here to be more concerned with his own person than the events affecting the destinies of the Ottoman Empire, his recordings provide us with an insight into many aspects of European politics at that period. In this relatively short chronicle, Vacarescu refers to an amazingly large number of Ottoman, Byzantine, Latin, French and Italian sources. He knew Cantemir's 'History' and also refers explicitly to some other authors whose works were extremely popular in the 18th century, such as Ladvocat...38 Voltaire.39 As to the Ottoman sources, he remarks in the preface that apart from earlier chroniclers he had seen and read the works of three Ottoman official chroniclers (vak'anuvis)40 - presumably in their printed versions - i.e. those of Naima (1652-1715), Ra?id (d. 1735) and Subhi (d. 1769),41 and he apparently knew the then vak'anuvis Enveri (Eiveri Efendi) (1735-1794).

The fact that it was considered by Vacarescu as an authoritative historical source (see his reference Isto rie, p. 212 concerning the character of Mehmed II) is highly significant. 39 - Vacarescu apparently had read the Essai sur les moeurs which he refers to as 'General History' (Istoria de obste; see his reference Istorie, p. 206, 218). 40 - His description of that office is far from Cantemir's polemics: "There are many writers of tevarih (tevarihuri) or Turkish annals, more so, since in this powerful em pire exists a special mansupu (mansib) or office, created exclusively for the writing of the tevarih of the emperors, or the Turkish 'Byzantide' (vizandida), called vak'aniivis (vacanuis), i.e. writers of the events and for this office are always chosen men en dowed with learning. This vak'aniivis is always obliged to meet with the learned ulema and all the enlightened rical (rigeali), especially with the kethuda of the grand vezir (kethudai sadri azem), and with the reisulkiittab (reizul chitabu) in order to in vestigate all the news, affairs and writings which arrive in the empire so that he may take notice of all events and include them into the writings of the history of the em perors, which he writes himself. All the above-mentioned rical are obliged to show him everything without delay or secrecy", Istorie, p. 186. 41 - Unlike Cantemir, he praises their elegant handling of "tecnis (tesnisuri) and istdah (istileahuri), i.e. metaphors and idioms, and the arrangement of words and ex pressions in periods which the Turks call kafiye (cafiele) according to the customs of their language" (ibid.). 42 - One translation of an Ottoman hatt-i serif by Ienachi(a Vacarescu was published in Bucharest in 1791, see Guboglu, M., Paleogrqfia si diplomatica turco-osmana, Bucharest, 1958, p. 16, and Bianu, loan and Nerva Hodo?, Bibliografia romdnesca veche 1508-1830, II, 1716-1808, Bucharest, 1910, p. 341 ff.</page><page sequence="10">226 Johann Strauss orific epithets gives his chronicle a certain Ottoman flair. Furthermore, he concluded his short biographies of the sultans with verses reminiscent of the old Ottoman chronicler A?ikpa?azade.

Among Vacarescu's acquaintances was also the chief physician (hachim basa) of the grand vizier Ragib Pa?a, 'Athanasaki who called himself Yp silanti',44 the author of a voluminous chronicle which may be regarded as the peak of Phanariot historiography. In a period where most historiog raphical works in Greek were either translations or adaptations from west ern sources, the work of the learned Phanariot Athanasios Komninos Ypsi lanti (1696-1789)45 holds an exceptional place. The author made his first studies in Jassy between 1724 and 1727, studied then medicine in Padua (1738) and became consequently physi cian to the Moldavian Hospodar Grigore Ghica (1739-1741) and later his kapukethiida in Istanbul. In 1744 he entered the service of Ragib Pa?a (1699-1783), the eminent grand vizier, scholar and poet46 whom he was to accompany to Aleppo, Urfa and Cairo. Only books VIII-X of this chronicle were published in Istanbul in 1870 by the archimandrite Germanos Afthonidis and are known under the title Ta meta tin Alosin (The events after the conquest)47 But the work is, in fact, a universal history, starting with the Creation and ending with the year 1791. In the latter part, however, it focuses on the events within the boundaries of the Ottoman empire. Perhaps in no other work is what has been called the "structure dyarchique" of the Ottoman empire48 reflected more clearly than in Ta meta tin Alosin: the dates of the Patriarchs' ap pointments determine the chronicle's structure as much as those of the new sultans' accessions Despite its basically annalistic structure - the chronology used is both 43 - Iorga, N., Istoria literaturii romdne in secolul al XVIII-lea (1688-1821), 2 vols., Bucharest, 1969 (new ed.), II, p. 120-122. 44-Istorie, p. 253. 45 - On his life and works see Iorga, N., Byzance apres Byzance, Bucharest, 1935, p. 237-241. 46 - On Ragib Pa?a see Baykal, Bekir Sitki and Karahan, Abdulkadir, "Ragib Pa?a", Islam Ansiklopedisi, IX, p. 594-598; Itzkowitz, Norman, Mehmed Raghib Pasha: the making of an Ottoman Grand Vezir, Princeton, 1959. 47 - 'AOavaaiov Kopvrjvov 'Yif/nAdvrov iKKXriGiaaxiKCJv jcai ttoAitkwv tow si; Scbdeica PifiXiov H' 0' Kai V fjtoi Td pexd rrjv "Akuoiv (1453-1789) ["Books 8-10 from the twelve books on ecclesiastical and political events by Athanasios Komninos Ypsilan tis, i.e. The events after the conquest (1453-1789)], Constantinople, 1870, repr.

Interesting details are also contained in the lengthy appendix on the "Customs of the Ottoman empire" (Ethima tis Othomanikis Vasileias), actually describing its main institution but also including sections of the Arabs and Albanians in the Ottoman empire, the Crimean Tatars, well as the provinces of Moldavia, Wallachia and Cyprus.49 Like Vacarescu's Rumanian, Athanasius Komninos Ypsilanti's Greek has been subjected to harsh criticisms. It has been described by Greek scholars as "the hideous jargon of the period, known as mixovarvaros, a, mixture of archaic ecclesiastical Greek and Turkish expressions".50 This criticism seems to be unfair. As a matter of fact, Athanasios uses a re markable number of mainly technical Ottoman terms whose correct use he knew perfectly well and whose translation would have made otherwise little sense. Since there is no doubt that Athanasios knew Turkish very well, one would thus expect him to have used Ottoman sources in abundance. At the end of the first part of his chronicle, finished in 1768 he writes that he had composed it in his yah in istinye (Neochori tou Sostheniou) within three years "with many pains and the study of books in many languages". This may be true for the sections concerning the appointments of patri archs and the affairs of the Orthodox church. His account of Ottoman af fairs until 1710 however follows almost slavishly Demetrius Cantemir's "History", including misunderstandings and mistakes. However, he does not omit to update his information occasionally51 and he criticises Can temir for obvious errors e.g. when the latter states that Mustafa II (1695 1703) had no children52 when he indicates the wrong location for the 49 - It includes the following chapters: "I On the Sultan.

As to genuine Ottoman sources he made use of at least one Ottoman his torian, namely Ra?id whose chronicle was available in the version printed by ibrahim Muteferrika in 1740.53 In the remaining sections, however, where the hejirah-dates are used only sporadically, he seems to have re lied mainly on non-Ottoman sources. Structural similarities to certain Ottoman chronicles are detectable in another non-Muslim chronicle written in the 18th century, the "History of the events during the reign of sultan Mehmed IV and the vezirate of the old Kopriilii Mehmed Pasha until the reign of Sultan Ahmed, son of the same sultan Mehmed, then under the vezirate of Damad Hasan Pasha"54 by the writer and poet known as Kaisarios Daponte (1713-84), who after a long and chequered career in the principalities, in Istanbul and in the Crimea, eventually became a monk and moved to Mount Athos where he wrote many of his works.55 Kaisarios Daponte, an extremely versatile writer with a tendency for didactic history writing56 has also left an important historical work on the sue?).

He was born in 1713/1714 on the island of Skopelos in the northern Sporades. His origi nal name was Constantine. He began his studies on his native island and continued them in Bucharest and Jassy. Daponte spent several years in Istanbul (1731, 1743, 1747). Due to his quarrelsome character and the intrigues of his enemies he was com pelled to seek refuge in Bahcesaray in the Crimea in 1746. One year later, he returned to Istanbul in the company of Selim Giray Han. Some disorders led to his imprison ment in the prison of Muhzi'r Aga. In 1753 he became a monk and assumed the name of Kaisarios. He died on Mount Athos in 1784. Among his historiographical works are a collection of biographies of the Byzantine emperors (Bifttoc Baadeicov) and a sort of biographical dictionary of prominent contemporaries ranging from patriarchs to sarrafs (Kaxaloyoc ioropiKOc; at;i6\oyo&lt;; tcov Kad'paq xprjjuanoavrcov imoripcov Pwjuaicoy). His Geographical History (Feoypa&lt;pncrj Toropta) includes a "Description of France" based on Yirmisekiz Celebi's Seyahatname-i Fransa (unpublished; see the extract in Legrand, Emile, Ephemerides Daces [cf. n. 57], III, p. LXII-LXIV). His often versified works contain valuable descriptions of, among other places, 18th century Istanbul and the Crimea.

With a quite accurate chronology but without indicating any dates it relates the events during the second half of the 17th century in an Ottoman context. Like Athanasios Komninos Ypsilanti's chronicle it abounds in Turkish terms which at times are even preferred to their Greek equivalents. The noteworthy events in the empire (i Vasileia) during that period, military campaigns (seferi), conquests, earthquakes, deaths, births of princes, ap pointments, reappointments (moukareri) and depositions (mazileia), are reported in a way not very different from that of Ottoman annalists of the period: [...]six months later the Emperor (o vasilevs) returned again to Adrianople. Since Ahmet Pasha the Koprulii son (Kiprouloglous) died he gave the seal to the rekiap kaimekam Kara Mustapha Pa sha, and appointed Kara Ibrahim Pasha as rekiap kaimekam.5* Even the chapter headings show similarities to those in Ottoman chroni cles. Despite its focus on general Ottoman history, Daponte's chronogra phos contains important concessions to the non-Muslim reader. Events concerning the Danubian principalities, for instance, obtain a more com prehensive treatment. Appointments of Grand Dragomans, Hospodars and Patriarchs are carefully listed. Sometimes traditions are recorded, which presumably were popular only among the Christian population: the artillerist who had blown up the Venetian Grand Admiral Mocenigo's flagship at the Dardanelles in 1657 is described as a Christian named Markos who had made a similar exploit during the siege of Baghdad un der Murad IV (Istoria, p. 4). Mehmed IV's visit to the monastery of Cetafuia near Jassy (built 1669-72 by George Douka) and a prophecy made on this occasion is nowhere recorded by any Ottoman chronicler (p. 13-14). Sabbatay Zvi, the false Messiah, is introduced as a native from the Morea (p. 11-12). Conversions of Turks to Christianity seem to be particularly noteworthy. But events of some economic importance are not omitted either such as the introduction of sursat, the creation of the hamr eminligi, of the avanzhane59 or the reform of the poll-tax (haratzi). 57 - Ephemerides Daces (AatciKai ?&lt;prjpepi'5?&lt;; fjrot avjufiefirj/cdra rerpaewvc pd/tic 'Odcojuavoppwaav, npdc 6e xai AvorpiaKtiv pe/ptc erovc 1739), 3 vols, Paris, 1880 1888. 58 - 'Iaropia raw ovpfiavrcov..., Sathas (ed.), p. 18. 59 - Cf. p. 42: "At that time [i.e. the reign of Suleyman II] the empire was in need of revenues.

The attitude of the chroniclers from the Phanar and the Principalities towards their Ottoman overlords ranged from the cautious to the openly hostile. The official chroniclers used to be more careful especially as far as the foreign policy of the Hospodars was concerned. There was a dan ger that chronicles of that type would be known in Istanbul, which might have lead to the Hospodors' execution, a fate not unfamiliar to many of them. Most of the later official Moldavian chronicles for example, do not criticise the Turks at all.60 For various reasons, Ienachifa Vacarescu, al though an admirer of Catherine the Great and the Hapsburgs, does not show any sign of disloyalty towards his Ottoman sovereigns and stresses the legalistic character of Ottoman rule.61 The empire, however, had lost much of its nimbus also in the eyes of its non-Muslim subjects after 1683 and especially after the disastrous de feat at the battle of Zenta in 1697 which Demetrius Cantemir had ob served as an eye-witness. At that time the downfall seemed to be immi nent. The aforementioned Jeremias Cacavelas explained the appearance of a two headed hare in Wallachia in the year 1688 to the Wallachian Hospodar ?erban Cantacuzene as follows: ?The reason [...] is none other than God should show you that Kingdom [i.e. the Ottoman empire], which aforetime walked about like a roaring lion over all, so that all trembled at it and feared, has now become a hare, and is no longer even whole, but half and half, and is incapable even of moving. Therefore fear it no more, but set with the others to hunt and rend it in pieces?.62 The perspective of an irreversible decline appears already in the title of Cantemir's work.63 It assumed that states, just like all other things in this world, had to go through consecutive stages of growth and decline 60 - Simionescu, Dan (ed.), Cronica Anonima a Moldovei 1661-1729. (Pseudo-Ami ras), Bucharest, 1975, p. 9. 61 - See his remarks in the proemium (Istorie, p. 195-196). 62 - Siege of Vienna, Marshall (ed.), p. vi, note 2. 63 - It should be observed that the title on the original manuscript, discovered in Harvard (cf. note 16) is slightly different. It reads Incrementa aulae othmanicae sive aliothmannicae historiae synopsis. Only the handwritten modification of the text says Demetrii principis Cantemirii incrementorum et decrementorum aulae othmannicae sive aliothmannicae historiae a prima gentis origine ad nostra usque tempora de ductae libri tres (Candea, 'Life story' p. 299). But many scholars have pointed out, like Mihail Guboglu, that ?... il nous faut reconnaitre que cette conception philoso phique n'apparait guere dans l'expose de l'histoire ottomane?, see Guboglu, M., "Dimitrie Cantemir - Orientaliste", in: Studia et acta orientalia, III (1961), p. 129 160, p. 133.</page><page sequence="15">The Rise of non-Muslim Historiography 231 and so the eventual collapse of the empire had been pre-established by natural laws.64 This idea which had originated in Italian Humanism, had been developed by Cantemir in more detail in his short treatise "Exami nation of Monarchy in the light of Natural Philosophy", (Monarchiarum physica examinatio 1714)65 which envisaged the Russian monarchy as the natural successor to the Ottoman state. Similar views were shared by his Wallachian contemporary Constantine Cantacuzene (ca 1650-1716)66 and later by Dionysios Photeinos (1769-1821).67 In the second half of the century, less enlightened writers preferred to evoke the ancient prophecies of a reconquest of Constantinople which were expected to be fulfilled at that period.68 Their outlook is pessimistic. Kaisarios Daponte muses about the liberation of Oriental Christendom and declares that if the ancient prophecies in this respect are not fulfilled, "it will be due to our unworthiness and that of the Russians and the de pravity that has become clearer than the sun during the six years of war after 1789".69 Athanasios Komninos-Ypsilanti who included large sec tions on the rising Russian state in his chronicle, shares a similar view. He also refers to astronomers, scholars and saints predicting that the City of Constantinople should be retaken 320 years after the Conquest by the Muscovites ?so that the Romaioi be liberated from Ottoman slavery and the Roman [i.e. Byzantine] empire re-emerge?. The fact that this moment had already passed by then, causes deep pessimism in him. He evokes the Jews on the rivers of Babylon and writes: ?Since the Romaioi have not been liberated despite these prophecies and the opportunities offered by the victories of the Russian armies, any revival of the Roman empire will 64 - Halil inalcik finds this anthropomorphic view of the state also in the writings of Ottoman authors like Katib Qelebi (1608-57) (see his Foreword to Dimitrie Cantemir, Historian of South East European and Oriental Civilisations, [cited n. 29] p. 8). 65 - Latin edition and Rumanian translation by Sulea-Firu, I., "O scriere inedita a lui Dimitrie Cantemir - Monarchiarum physica examinatio" [An unpublished Work by Demetrius Cantemir - Monarchiarum physica examinatio], in: Studii si cercetari de bibliologie, V (1963), p. 267-276. 66 - From his numerous works, only a fragment of a History of Wallachia has been preserved. 67 - Dionysios Photeinos is the author of a short and unfinished Ottoman History up to Mahmud II, written in the second decade of the 19th century, in Greek. It seems to be based partly on Katib Celebi's Takvimu t-tevarih. See Papacostea, Victor, "Vie{ile Sultanilor. Scriere inedita a lui Dionisie Fotino" [The Lives of the Sultans.

In 1813, in a different period, the Greek Grand Dragoman Iakovos Argyropoulos [Yakovaki Efendi] (1776-1850) was entrusted by some Ottoman statesmen (rical) with the translation of a work on contemporary history from a Western language into Ottoman Turkish. This work, the "History of Catherine the Great" (Katerine Tarihi) compiled from a French original and several other sources, also dealt with the threat of Russian expansion culminating in the possible conquest of Constantinople.
