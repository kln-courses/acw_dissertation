Wilkins AlliedSignal Safety Restraint Systems ABSTRACT Conventional restraint systems designed to meet US FMVSS standards only have one level of operation. The seat belt imparts a restraint force to the occupant reflective of belt stiffness characteristics and the airbag is either inflated or not inflated. The system is tuned to one crash scenario, typically a 30 mph (48 kph) barrier crash with an unbelted 50 h%ile MHIII dummy. Situations involving other occupants, crash speeds or belt usage conditions may result in tradeoffs to maintain acceptable results for all conditions. Currently, there is considerable interest in adaptive restraint systems that can detect various crash conditions and adjust the restraint system to provide increased levels of protection. There is also a great deal of interest in systems that can detect an out of position occupant and adjust the airbag deployment to lessen the possibility of deployment induced injuries. The development of restraint hardware has been on-going for some time and testing shows that these devices can provide enhanced occupant protection. The next logical step is to begin to combine these components with appropriate sensing technologies and control systems that understand the implications of the decision making process. The value of the adaptive restraint system has been demonstrated in its ability to adjust for different crash conditions and a degree of real- time decision making capability has been demonstrated in sled testing. Furthermore, significant reduction in airbag deployment induced injuries are made possible by detecting an out of position occupant and altering airbag inflation parameters. INTRODUCTION Airbags installed on automobiles sold in the United States are designed to meet Federal crash test requirements (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208). Fundamentally, this crash test standard requires automobile manufacturers to provide protection to an unbelted, average sized male occupant in a 30 mph (48 kph) crash into a rigid barrier, by means of an inflatable restraint [1], Although the crash energy associated with a 30 mph (48 kph) barrier crash is significantly higher than the majority of collisions that occur on US highways [2], the federal standard requires automakers to design systems for relatively severe conditions. Significant among the airbag system design parameters that require tuning for FMVSS 208 are the speed of deployment and the firmness of the airbag. The airbag must be quite firm to dissipate the energy of an unbelted 50th%ile MHIII dummy at the required crash velocity. However, that degree of stiffness may be greater than is necessary for smaller occupants or for occupants involved in crashes of lesser severity. Additionally, an occupant who is restrained by a seatbelt as well as an airbag, will not require an airbag with the same degree of firmness as would an unbelted occupant. The result is that too much restraint energy may be applied to occupants under certain accident conditions. During a 30 mph (48 kph) barrier crash, the velocity of the occupant movement within the vehicle interior typically requires that the airbag must be substantially full 30 milliseconds after initiation of deployment [3]. This is necessary in order to allow the airbag time to provide adequate space for the absorption the occupant's kinetic energy. This deployment speed dictates the need for very high inflation flow rates that translate into very high forces in close proximity to the airbag. While these forces pose no threat at distances involving normally seated occupants, they may impart injurious forces to occupants who happen to be positioned too closely to the deploying module. Real world crashes have a high degree of randomness. Despite designer's best efforts to predict and test for various crash scenarios, some crash situations may result in an unbelted occupant being too close to the module upon deployment. The problem is particularly acute when small children are involved, since their lower mass increases the possibility of injuries. [4] Restraint systems of the future will incorporate adjustable components that will be tuned for various factors such as occupant weight, crash severity, seat 1928</page><page sequence="2">belt usage and occupant position within the passenger compartment [5]. Appropriate sensors must be employed to detect these conditions and a control system must be developed to use the information to produce an appropriate response. This entire assembly of sensors and adjustable restraints can be considered to be part of an advanced "Adaptive Restraint System". This paper presents the state of development of this system and presents the results of testing and analysis. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED SYSTEM Typical restraint system performance can be improved when one considers the variety of actual crashes that occur on our highways. For example, the vast majority of seatbelts on the road today are simple retractable bands that hold an occupant in place. In a crash, the tension in the belt increases nearly linearly with the amount of stretch imparted to it by the occupant. Thus, the tension in the belt is ever increasing, translating into increasing force levels imparted to the chest of the occupant. Since injuries are related to peak forces and accelerations sustained by occupants, this type of restraint presents possibilities for improvement. "Constant force" seatbelt systems are under development that limit the amount of tension in the belt (and therefore the force placed on the occupant) by allowing compliance at a pre-determined constant force level. Additionally these seat belt systems utilize electrically actuated high-output pre-tensioners to impart a pre-load to the belt to further increase its effectiveness. [6] The constant-force seatbelt and airbag together create a system that can be finely tuned to provide nearly optimal restraint performance in a given crash situation [6], However, this still represents a system that is optimized for only one particular crash scenario. Various size occupants require different restraint force levels. A system tuned for an average male at 35 mph (56 kph) will be more firm than is desirable for a smaller, lighter occupant. Similarly, a system tuned for the average person may have too little restraining capability to keep a heavier person from impacting the windshield or instrument panel. The optimal restraint force changes as other factors such as crash severity and belt usage vary. Ideally, restraint systems should be able to adjust for these factors. To provide optimal restraint, multi-level restraint devices should be capable of adjusting restraint forces, to particular situations. For instance, a constant force retractor is under development that offers three levels of load limiting, adjustable in real time in response to the conditions present at the time of collision. Likewise, two methods will be presented to adjust the restraint force provided by an airbag. The first is a multi-level inflator to alter, not only the volume of gas introduced into the airbag, but also the velocity at which this gas is delivered. This output is varied by the manner in which the inflator's two initiators are actuated. For a low level deployment, only one squib is fired. For a high level deployment, both squibs are fired simultaneously. If an inflation level between the high and low is desired, a delay can be programmed between the actuation of the two squibs to finely tune the output. This is shown in Figure 1 . The second method of adjusting an airbag's restraint force is to vary the amount of gas that is vented out of the bag during occupant restraint. Figure 1: Multi-Level Inflator Tank Test 400 _ jj) 1 50 - - Ja - A - 10 msec Delay ! 2 100 Tr - ® - 30 msec Delay 50 W - + - |_ow Leve| only omomoiooLoomo T-cOTfcor-OiOOJoou-) Time (msec) For normally seated occupants, it is desirable to introduce a full airbag early in the event to initiate occupant restraint as soon as possible utilizing all available space for energy absorption.

However, the particular conditions present at the time of the crash may dictate that different restraint forces be applied depending upon those conditions. In order to adjust the restraint force provided by an airbag for normally seated occupants, the amount of gas vented out of the airbag will be adjusted by means of vent openings in the airbag housing. These openings are electrically actuated at the time of the crash to control airbag stiffness during the crash event. Figure 2 illustrates the chest acceleration levels as a result of adjusting both the venting characteristics and inflator output as predicted by 1929</page><page sequence="3">MADYMO simulation. A study was set up with a PAB system designed to FMVSS 208 requirements, except that a 5,h%ile FHIII replaced the ôO'Hile MHIII in our model. As can be seen from the figure, if the inflation level is lessened in response to the lower mass of the occupant, the peak accelerations actually increase. When the inflator output is left unchanged and the venting is increased, the chest accelerations are decreased as compared to the baseline system. This venting system cannot replace a multi-level inflator. For occupants who might otherwise be injured by the high deployment speed of an airbag, the multi- level inflator's ability to decrease flow rates can have a significant effect on injury criteria. Figure 3a-c shows the results of static out of position testing with a 5,h%ile FHIII at distances of 25, 150 and 250 mm from the PAB module. The tests were run with an FMVSS 208 inflator and also with a low level .inflator to quantify improvements in injury criteria. As can be seen from the figure, reducing inflator output may significantly decrease the potential for deployment-related injuries. Figures 3a-c: Static Test Results For a 5%ile FHIII In summary, a sensor system will need to detect the following inputs: 1 ) Seat belt usage 2) Occupant proximity to airbag 3) Occupant weight 4) Crash severity A control system in turn will take these sensor inputs and utilize them to adjust: 1) Airbag fill velocity 2) Gas volume introduced into the airbag 3) Airbag venting area 4) Seat belt load limiting. Accurate sensing of these various factors is critical for an effective system. The following sensors are being developed to control the adaptive restraint system presented. Occupant Position - The proximity of an occupant to the airbag module is a very important factor in determining correct airbag deployment forces. An electric field occupant presence and proximity system is under development. This system consists of a series of copper foil sheets embedded into the instrument panel and oriented in such a way as to act as a capacitor. Rather than a traditional capacitor, however, where the electric field flows between two plates, the orientation of these plates acts to project an electric field outward, toward the occupant. Since humans have enough moisture in their bodies to act as a dielectric, the presence of a person in the electric field will change the capacitance of the sensor. The magnitude of change in capacitance varies with the proximity of the person to the sensor. Therefore, measuring the change in capacitance can determine the proximity of an occupant to the module. A particular benefit to electric field technology is its ability to discriminate between humans and most inanimate objects which are poor dielectrics. The electric field also can penetrate objects such as newspapers that may block ultrasonic or infrared beams utilized in other occupant sensors. Perhaps the most important benefit to the electric field occupant sensor under development is the system's ability to react in under 2 milliseconds. This response time is fast enough to allow the sensor to detect an occupant being thrown forward in the passenger compartment due to panic braking or a long crash pulse/late fire time event. Occupant Weight - Several companies have weight classification sensors under development. Typically, 1930</page><page sequence="4">these sensors are positioned in the seat cushion. For purposes of this analysis and the physical sled testing presented in a later section of this paper, four load cells were positioned at the seat mounting locations to measure the weight of the occupant in the seat. Seatbelt Usage - Seatbelt buckle switches have long been used to determine if the belt has been fastened and to actuate an audible reminder. While these switches can be used during the early development of adaptive restraint systems, they are not adequate for production level adaptive restraint systems. Hall Effect sensors will be necessary to provide adequate reliability levels when used as an integral part of a production level adaptive restraint system. Crash Severity - A current, state of the art single point sensor system includes accelerometers inside the electronic control unit that measure the reaction of the passenger compartment and a microprocessor to analyze these inputs and make the fire/no-fire decision. Virtually all major single point sensor manufacturers are developing systems that will not only determine if an airbag is needed, but also will be able to discriminate the level of severity of the crash. Integrating all of these variables is a fairly complex problem. Control of each restraint factor depends upon all of the sensed conditions of crash severity, belt usage, occupant weight and position. Moreover, those factors are also interdependent upon each other. For example, the amount of seat belt load limiting required is dependent upon the stiffness of the airbag. A computer algorithm was developed to analyze these factors and determine the appropriate settings for adjustable restraint components. COMPUTER MODELING: MADYMO crash simulation was used to develop appropriate levels to which adjustable restraint factors should be tuned for various crash conditions. A model was assembled to simulate a passenger in a generic vehicle environment and a generic pulse. The model was correlated to a 35 mph (56 kph) crash with a belted occupant using the results of HYGE sled testing. The following factors were modeled: Occupant Sizes: 5,h%ile FHIII, 50th%ile MHIII, and 95,h%ile MHIII Restraint system: Airbag/Seatbelt with Pretensioner and Airbag only Occupant Position: Full Forward, Mid-position, and Full-Forward 1931 Crash severity: 14 mph (22 kph), 18 mph, 30 mph (48 kph), 35 mph (56 kph) For the purposes of this study, crash severity was defined as impact velocity into a rigid barrier at 0°. Simulations were run with various combinations of the above factors and several combinations of airbag venting and seatbelt load limiting. For the initial study, only normally seated occupants were investigated. Previous analysis determined that regulating airbag venting characteristics was more effective than regulating inflator flow characteristics when adjusting restraint forces for normally seated occupants. Consequently, only seatbelt load limiting and venting were varied. Table 1 illustrates the results of the modeling for one of the cases, (50th%ile MHIII, mid-position at 30 mph (48 kph) barrier crash). This process was repeated for other cases until enough information was available to determine optimal restraint characteristics for the anticipated situations. That information, in turn, was used to produce a control algorithm. Table 1: Run No. I Bag Porosity! Load Limiter, kN HIC 3MS - Chest G's| Chest Def. (mm) 1 " OxStd.

A system schematic is presented in Figure 4. Once the various inputs are known, there must be a decision making process to determine appropriate settings for the restraint devices. If only one input is taken into account, occupant weight for example, the restraint system tailoring can be a simple linear adjustment from low-level for a light occupant, to high level for heavy occupants.</page><page sequence="5">However, taking several factors into account increases the complexity of the decision making process. Figure 4: System Schematic The first step in validating the algorithm was to pick various crash scenarios with different factors as defined. Those conditions were then input into a computer program with the algorithm to see what restraint adjustment levels would be chosen. MADYMO simulations were performed on each scenario to compare predicted injury criteria utilizing restraint settings recommended by the algorithm with predicted injury criteria utilizing a baseline system. In this case, the baseline system was a current, restraint system that included a single level load limiting seat belt system and airbag. This number will be used in a mathematical formula to set levels of the adaptive restraint components. See Table 2 for one possible configuration of these factors. Table 2: Factor Magnitude A-Crash severity 1-mild crash, 10-severe crash B-Occupant Mass 1 -light person, 10-heavy C-Seatbelt Use 1 -belted, 2-unbelted D-Occupant to IP 0-touching, 10-normally seated proximity The entire system would be controlled by an electronic module that monitors all relevant factors such as those in Table 2 and chooses the appropriate airbag and seatbelt settings. The first decision to be made is whether the crash is severe enough to fire the pretensioner and set the load limiting level of the constant force retractor. The second decision is whether the crash is severe enough to fire the airbag. At that point, all the factors must be taken into account and the control system must manage the adjustment of the restraint system. An algorithm based on a set of mathematical equations was derived to calculate restraint adjustment levels. This algorithm operates on the assumption that there is a condition where all factors are maximized, calling for the maximum restraint force to be applied. For the airbag inflator, the highest output occurs when the occupant weight, the occupant distance from the airbag, and crash severity are at maximum levels and the occupant is not wearing a seat belt. For airbag venting, the maximum restraint force (and therefore the minimum venting) occurs when the occupant weight, the occupant distance from the airbag, and crash severity are at maximum levels and the occupant is not wearing a seat belt. For the constant force retractor, the maximum restraint force occurs when the occupant weight and the crash severity are at maximum levels but occupant distance from the airbag is minimum. A separate control equation is used for each of the restraint components. The equation compares the state of the actual input factor such as crash severity, occupant weight, etc. to a maximum value and this difference is used to modify the restraint system from the maximum. Weighting factors are then assigned to each input, giving more weight to those factors that will have a greater influence on the particular restraint component setting. For example, a large weighting factor is applied to the occupant proximity sensor signal when it is used to control airbag inflation. This results in a significant decrease in airbag inflation velocity which, in turn, should lessen the possibility of deployment-related injuries. The equation approach allows for a continuous response to the input parameters as opposed to a look up table that has been proposed for these systems. The MADYMO study presented earlier was used to determine appropriate weighting factors for each restraint component. The control of this system is based on the assignment of a number (from 1 to 10, for example) to each of the inputs to represent its magnitude. As illustrated in Table 3, there was significant improvement in injury criteria for all of the crash situations investigated.

Table 3: Adaptive Restraint Modeling 1932</page><page sequence="6">SLED TEST VALIDATION A sled test was performed to further validate the adaptive restraint concept. The main purpose of this testing was to determine if the various conditions could be sensed and the systems actuated, all in the time frame at which a crash event occurs. This particular test condition was designed to determine if the system could recognize an occupant that was thrown out of position due to the crash forces in a late fire event and respond by lowering the output of the inflator. The electric field occupant sensor has been shown to have an extremely rapid response time. Figure 5 illustrates the output of the electric field occupant sensor during a previous sled test. In this case, the output was not used for decision making, but was simply monitored to compare with the actual dummy trajectory. As can be seen by Figure 5, the occupant sensor tracked the head location quite closely, once the head came within the range of the sensor. It should be noted that this test was performed with an earlier version of the sensor having less range than current versions of the device. Figure 5: Comparison of Occupant Position for Capacitive Occupant Sensor vs. Film Analysis (22.4 km/hr velocity hyge sled test.) The simulated crash test was conducted on a 9-inch HYGE sled. The generic test fixture, or "buck," consisted of sheet metal reinforced with rectangular steel tube. A 5th%ile FHIII Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) was situated without a safety belt in the right front passenger seat in a full-forward position. The airbag module consisted of a multi-level inflator, nylon airbag, steel housing with variable venting capabilities and an electric field occupant sensor located within the airbag door. The forward sensing range of the occupant sensor was approximately 14 inches (356 mm). Therefore, the nose of the ATD was positioned slightly beyond that distance so that the occupant would not be detected until it moved into range of the sensor during the simulated crash event. The control electronics were mounted on the sled buck and included a microprocessor to run the control algorithm. During the event, the control electronics would determine airbag firing time and vary the output of the dual-level inflator based on the input from the occupant sensor. The control system also controlled actuation of the airbag variable venting system, although the tailoring of the inflation rate was expected to have the greatest effect on airbag performance in this out of position test. The sled buck with microprocessor and related components are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: Test Setup The Sled was fired at 20 mph (32.2 kph) with a pulse that represented an angular collision. This pulse was chosen because of its relatively late fire time. To ensure that the occupant was quite close to the airbag during deployment, the fire time was further increased to 97 msec. No external signals were sent to the sled buck for control of the restraint devices. The output of the sled carriage accelerometer was routed to the adaptive restraint control electronics which used that signal to determine the initiation of the crash event. The initial fire time of the first squib was programmed into the microprocessor prior to the test, but the second squib fire time, as well as the decision to actuate the venting devices, were all controlled by the algorithm. The timing of the control system's decision-making process for this test is shown in Figure 7. As can be seen, the algorithm chose a delay time of 28.3 msec between the firing of the first and second squibs based on the proximity of the occupant's head to airbag door. Because of the relatively low weight of the occupant and moderate crash severity, the system chose to open all of the airbag vents as well. 1933</page><page sequence="7">PRIMARY SQUIB 5^' ' n H . : VOLTAGE EXCEEDS L_J i i VOLT AT 96.7 MSEC 2.5"" 0 I i I I I I !

The value of the adaptive restraint system concept has been demonstrated through coniputer simulation. Initial sled tests show that the electronics can react quickly enough to be effective. Considerable work remains to test and tune all of the parameters to specific vehicles. Given all of the variables involved with real world conditions, and the limits of presently-available sensing technology, it is probably not reasonable to expect precise restraint system optimization for all of the situations which are likely to be encountered. It is the opinion of the authors that the goal of the adaptive system should be simply to demonstrate significant performance improvements over current, non-adjustable systems. Future work will involve a substantial number of sled tests to demonstrate the benefits of such a system in many more situations, and ultimately, the application of this system to an actual production vehicle.
