In response to the fascination of foreigners who marvelled at the city's singular topography and its reputation for liberty and licentiousness, the bird's-eye view and images of local social types - such as the doge and courtesan - became transmuted into icons of the city's urban identity. The medium and modes of representation used to reproduce the republic's social and physical organization on paper are crucial here, for it was the repetition and sedimentation of visual conventions that forged iconicity. Venice was redefined as a centre in which all the world could be seen. And the mechanisms for this redefinition , as this article argues , emerged , in part , out of print, for it was because the city could be seen from the eye of a bird, on paper as an image, by foreigners - that it could be re-envisioned from the outside in. 'Without any doubt, [Venice] can be called the theatre of the world.'1 So claims the Venetian guide to the visitor in Francesco Sansovino's dialogue, Delle cose notabili che sono in Venetia, published in Venice in 1561. The city as a theatre was an early modern topos; atlases and books of city maps, for instance, contained the cosmos, and viewers could leaf through pages depicting the particulars of a place as if changing scenes. In Venice, however, the concept resonated with widespread perceptions of the city as a stage teeming with foreigners; as Giulio Ballino explained to readers of his book of city maps, Venice was 'inhabited by an infinite multitude of people who come together for commerce from various nations, in fact from all the world. They use all languages and are dressed in different * I am grateful to Villa I Tatti where I was a fellow when writing an earlier version of this article for the conference, Urban Icons, organized by Vanessa Schwartz and Philip Ethington at the University of Southern California in 2004. 1 have continued to benefit from their intellectual energy and enthusiasm when revising this article, and I thank them both, warmly and sincerely, for their insights and suggestions.

By the end of the sixteenth century, however, the city's dominant trading position was being usurped as the centre of European economic activity was shifting toward markets outside the Mediterranean. In spite of waning power on the international political stage - indeed, as if responding to this - printmakers drew attention to the singularity of the city's topography and its inhabitants. By projecting diverse ideas about the city into woodcuts and engravings, Venice and Venetian social types were transmuted into urban icons. With more than 450 printers, publishers and booksellers in the area, printmakers looked beyond the local market to an international one.3 For example, Giacomo Franco capitalized on the presence of foreigners for the coronation of the dogaressa in 1597; the procession was a rare ceremony, not seen since 1557, and the spectacle offered the opportunity to sell engravings (Figure l).4 In one of these prints, Franco has framed a bird's-eye view with a cartouche in which figures of the doge, the elected figurehead of the republic and his consort appear together. Juxtaposed with the stunning cityscape in the print, the doge and dogaressa contribute to an ideal image of Venice in which domestic, political and geographic order overlap.5 By the end of the century, when this print was made, the bird's- eye view with its legend to the city's districts had become emblematic of the republic. So too had its representatives: not only the doge and dogaressa, but also the senator, rettore (governor), courtesan and virgin. These were the leading actors in a larger cast who had become icons of the city. Recognizable because of their distinctive costumes, these social types expressed a range of ideas associated with the city. Scholars have drawn attention to the costumed figures, often shown in couples, which sometimes frame geographical maps in the seventeenth century.6 But it is the earlier history of these chorographic details that is of concern here. Since borders between countries were subject to change in the sixteenth 2 Giulio Ballino, De' Disegni delle più illustri città , &amp; fortezze del mondo (Venice, 1569).

Costume books followed this lead, emulating atlases in scope, but focusing on civic or regional costumes. Print fuelled interest in cities by making comparisons between them easy, a practice encouraged by the publication of series of maps and costumes.8 These were pan-European phenomena and the focus on Venice therefore brings forward conventions that are characteristic of the imagery in general. The lagoon city also stands out from other centres; the iconic status of the imagery discussed here was magnified by the city's singularity: its stunning cityscape and pivotal geographical location, its constitution and its reputation for liberty and licentiousness. The efficacy of prints and the changes I ascribe to them depend on their dynamic relation with social experience, and this is important for 7 John Hale, Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance (New York, 1994), 20. ö Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg's Civitates orbis terrarum 1572-1618 (Amsterdam, 1965) is the most famous.

The novelty of the technology and its conventions - the production of multiples, the combination of prints into series, an international market, the graphic nature of the medium and emphasis on form - are key elements in the changes described below. Moreover, the medium - typically reduced in scale and portable - contributed to the process of condensing a range of meanings into images, a process that underpins iconicity as described here. Through repetition - both the practice of copying models and widespread circulation in woodcuts and engravings - a range of ideas could be distilled into a visual image. An icon, traditionally a portrait, carries, or contains, the presence of the sitter through the icon's likeness to an original (the face of Christ in Veronica's veil, for example, a miracle-working image, or an image that appears miraculously). In his important study of icons, Hans Belting concludes by noting that in the sixteenth century the function of the image changes: 'The new presence of the work succeeds the former presence of the sacred in the work. . .[Instead of the sacred,] it is the presence of an idea that is made visible in the work: the idea of art, as the artist had it in mind.'10 In this new early modern context, the subject matter of a work was becoming subordinated to how it was represented, to the concept and style of the artist. One corollary of this change, as the imagery considered here suggests, was a new concept of the icon; instead of a miracle working image, or copy of a holy image, the icon became a sign. The development of print is key here, since the new media of woodcuts and engraving were at the heart of this transformation. And yet resemblance - the likeness of the icon to the original - did not disappear with what Belting describes as the modern era of art, or Michel Foucault defines as the classical age of representation. Instead, as the bird's-eye view and costume figures suggest, resemblance remains important to the icon's semiotic efficacy. Located at the crossroads between East and West, Venice was a destination for foreign merchants and pilgrims like Canon Pietro Casóla, who wrote of his impressions when embarking on a pilgrimage in 1494. For Casóla the city appeared both 'well ordered and arranged' but also impossible to perceive as a whole: 'I cannot give the dimensions of this city, for it appears to me not one city alone but several cities placed together.'11 Casola's reflections convey the visitor's conflicting experiences of the cityscape: on the one side, the numerous islands and seemingly 9 Bronwen Wilson, The World in Venice: Print, the City and Early Modern Identity (Toronto, 2005), chapters 1 and 2. 10 Hans Belting's emphasis in Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image before the Era of Art, trans.

These fundamentally different ways of perceiving Venice were brought together in the single remarkably coherent image designed by de'Barbari (Figure 2). With its date boldly stamped at the top of the print - 'At Venice 1500' - the famous woodcut declares its own historical importance, as if predicting its archetypal status among printed views of Venice, and even city views in general.12 In his appeal to the Venetian Senate to waive export duties, the publisher Anton Kolb extolled the 'new art of printing', proposing that his immense woodcut would propagate the 'fame of this most excellent city'. Covering nearly four square metres, the print was a representational triumph, both for its size and its meticulous detail.13 The viewer is projected to a vantage-point previously inconceivable. At close range, it is the spectacular detail of the urban topography that comes into focus (Figure 2).

With its striking naturalism, contemporaries could have recognized each house and every contrada , the parish or district, which identified every resident in the city.14 The viewer's physical movement across the vast surface of the print, glancing from place to place, corresponds with the temporality and particulars of lived experiences of the city through which identity is constituted by the accretions of perceptions absorbed through looking. Yet, the replication of elements such as windows throughout the city constructs an image of uniformity. Of course there are strategic exclusions and emphases, such as the orientation and axis established by the figures of Mercury and Neptune that direct the viewer to the political and commercial centres at San Marco and Rialto. Nevertheless, the claim is one of homogeneity. The eye-witness experience of the city resembles republican space as understood by contemporaries in which the mobile spectator moves from place to place, free from the surveillance of the prince. The woodcut is overlaid with inscriptions and toponyms that play with the viewer's perception of surface and depth. For example, the Ducal Palace both resembles the real government building and it is identified by the letters PA LA CI VI (Figure 2). Carved into the woodblock, the name draws attention to the function of the map as a text.15 The use of toponyms would have taught viewers how to interpret the woodcut, to recognize the relation between the name of a parish and its appearance, between signifier and signified, between naming and seeing. The combination of image and text also mobilizes the observer's movement across the surface of the picture plane. Moving away from the surface, by contrast, the evidentiary quality of the cityscape dissolves (Figure 2). It is the city as a whole and the classical frame, with its heroic gods, that comes into focus, arresting the viewer's gaze. The vast lands of the Terraferma - the Venetian mainland seen at the top - have been compressed to a thin band at the horizon, the whole protected by the fortress of Alps that isolates the historical centre in the foreground. Seen from this Olympian point of view - almost perpendicular to the city - the topography appears in plan, the city unpopulated, its geographic contours fixed in time. The name and date, carved into the pear woodblock like an epitaph, point to the picture's status as a sign. This synoptic structure of the bird's-eye view would have encouraged viewers to move between the general and particular, the 'harmonious totality' that Louis Marin identifies with utopie description.16 The point of utopia, for Marin, is its existence as representation, as a fiction that 14 Elizabeth Crouzet-Pavan, ' Sopra le Acque Salse': espaces, pouvoir et société à Venise à la fin du Moyen-Age, 2 vols.

There are social reasons why this is important, but for the purpose of this article, the woodcut, with its combination of local detail and unified whole, emblematizes the relation between the individual resident and the collective, the ideological key to the city's political and social geography. Sources available to dą'Barbari include world maps that were often illustrated with anthropomorphic winds. For example, twelve human faces, their cheeks inflated, blow toward the continents of the world in a page from the first Italian edition of Ptolemy's Geographia , initially published by Nicolo Todescho in Florence around 1480 (Figure 3). Another type appears in the woodcut of the cosmos printed in Hartman Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle ( Weltchronik 1493), a book that Kolb was selling in Venice before 1499.18 A patch of land identified as terra is surrounded by concentric circles illustrating the planets, with God enthroned at the top. Four life-like wind gods fill the corners of the page. This cosmological model was typical of medieval mappaemundi in which Jerusalem was situated at the centre of the universe to signify the pilgrim's journey to the Holy Land.19 In the Kolb and de'Barbari woodcut, the classical frame has subsumed the theological one: the islands of Venice have been substituted for earth, 17 Ibid., 53.

Both the cartographic and the cosmological model have been translated into an image of Venice as a world unto itself, the centre of the universe toward which the winds blow. The landscape emerges from the water, as if conjured from the sea by the eight wind gods that circle the islands, as if a priori to the artist's work. Instead of the artist transcribing the city, Venice appears from the sea miraculously as if fully formed, like Venus - with whom the city is compared - exposing herself.20 The extraordinary verisimilitude of the woodcut and the absence of a document identifying de'Barbari have contributed to questions about the extent of his involvement in the project. Nevertheless, his self-reflective engagement with the medium and the use of naturalism is evident in the work in several ways, and one is significant for understanding the iconic function of the map. Perhaps, as has been suggested on the basis of a posthumous portrait of de'Barbari, the face of the Greek wind god on the upper right is a self-portrait (Figure 4). 21 More certainly, the naturalistic physiognomy functions as an analogue for the mimetic accuracy of the city scape and the mirror image of the printmaker's work. Furthermore, with this face in the image de'Barbari evokes Ptolemy, whose parallel between geography and the portraitist became a commonplace in the Renaissance. For Ptolemy, the geography of the world was analogous with the human face, and its cities, comparable with facial features (Figure 5): 'The aim of the chorographer is to represent only one part, as if one were to imitate or to paint only one ear, or an eye. But the aim of the geographer is to consider the universal whole in the guise of those who describe or paint the entire head.'22 Remarkably, de'Barbari has combined both visual metaphors in the same bird's-eye view as we have seen: the geographer who delineates the entire human face, and the chorographer 's devotion to the eye or the nose seen in the windows and alleys. In this synoptic image, then, Venice was envisioned as both a face and a close-up. The map brings together a range of visual ideas to produce an idealized portrait of the city floating in the lagoon that protects its liberty and sustains its prestige as a trading emporium. This image became the archetype for subsequent maps of Venice, and yet the sheer audacity of the representa- tion - artistically and technically - precluded direct emulation in scale or detail.23 The immense size of the original woodcut, whose six large sheets 20 On Venice personified as a woman see David Rosand, Myths of Venice: The Figuration of a State (Chapel Hill, NC, 2001), 26-46, 100-8, 114-17. 21 Giuseppe Mazzariol and Terisio Pignatti, La pianta prospettica di Venezia del 1500 disegnata da Jacopo de' Barbari (Venice, 1962), 8, 10. 22 Girolamo Ruscelli's translation of Ptolemy, Geografia di Glaudio Tolomeo Alessandrino (Venice, 1598), 1. 23 Although dozens of views of Venice followed, the image was not copied closely until 1635 when it was engraved on a much reduced scale by Matteus Merian and published in Cologne.

Engraving provided the means for this transformation, thereby eclipsing the use of woodblocks for maps.24 Condensed into ever smaller formats, city views had become portable and they could be bound together in series and incorporated into books. Paolo Forlani's map marks a critical point of change, when the temporal embodied experience of looking at the city is cleaved apart from the spatial representation (Figure 6). Forlani calls attention to the convenience of the small form and fine detail enabled by copper engraving in his map of the city from 1566; indeed, in the text he invites comparisons with the print's predecessors, a reference to the de'Barbari map. The two metal plates could be printed on a single large sheet, a dramatic reduction from the six (and sometimes twelve) sheets required for the six blocks of de'Barbari's woodcut.25 The impressive legend - with hundreds of references - was also intended to facilitate the viewer's vicarious experience, a feature explained the following year by Leandro Alberti on the verso of his map of Venice in his Isolario : we have supplied in part with this legend, a letter or number that corresponds to the church, or other thing that one wants; that number or letter then, one will find in the figure, and where it is, will be the place looked for; and conversely, having found the letter or number in the figure, and then located it in the legend, one will be able to know what place it is.26 The canals, like those in the Forlani map, are identified by Roman numerals in the legend and they progress sequentially around the islands, enabling the viewer to circumnavigate their contours. The Arabic numerals identify the city's contrade but these bear little relation to movement through the city. One can locate a number in the map, and then find the name of the parish in the list, but unless one is familiar with the city, it is much harder to start with a number from the legend and find it in the map. Despite Alberti's emphasis on the reciprocity between the image and the legend, then, the engraving would not have assisted visitors trying to navigate the alleys of Venice. However, it does compensate, as he notes, for the fact that it is impossible to picture all the bridges, churches and details in a small format. Thus in contrast to de'Barbari's woodcut, in which all these features would have enabled viewers to traverse the surface of the picture and to recognize their parish, a viewer of Alberti's or Forlani's map mediates between the image and the text. Moreover by abandoning 24 On the technological and aesthetic considerations of copperplate engraving see David Woodward, Maps as Prints in the Italian Renaissance: Makers, Distributors &amp; Consumers.

These ideals were explicitly linked to the urban fabric of Venice where the 'beauty and splendor' of the city's landscape were celebrated as physical manifestations of 'its excellent government'.28 This political ideal and the mechanisms of the legend work together with the bird's-eye view published in the first volume of Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg's Civitates orbis terrarum (1572) (Figure 7).29 An elegant cartouche located in the middle of the legend contains a group of costumed figures. It is a section of a procession, copied from a much longer series of figures, with the crucial figures of the doge and senators: representatives of the monarchical and oligarchical components of the mixed government, and also members of the ruling nobility. The grand chancellor, who precedes the doge, represents the citizen class, and thus serves as a gesture toward those more elite Venetians who were constitutionally excluded from the government. Flanking the cartouche is the legend; the system of contrade has become emblematic of the resident's fixed, immutable place in the Venetian mondo, a sign of the city's unique social and political geography. Still anchored to de'Barbari's cosmological ideal, the bird's- eye view contributes to an image of Venice as an autonomous and well- arranged universe. No longer a portrait of the city, the three registers of the print function allegorically; to adapt William Empson's definition, the print impresses on the viewer the sense that the three levels 'correspond to each other in detail and indeed that there is some underlying reality, something in the nature of things, which makes this happen . . . But the effect of allegory is to keep the . . . levels of being very distinct in your mind though they interpenetrate each other in so many details.'30 With the cleaving apart of time and space - registered, in part, in the legend and the iconic view of the city's contours - what was once the mobile eye of the person in the street has been transformed into a process of interpretation on the part of the viewer situated outside the frame. While Venetians were preoccupied 27 Gasparo Contarini's text was published in the vernacular in 1544. La Republica, e i magistrati di Vinegia . . . nuouamente fatti uolgari, etc., trans. E.

The bird's-eye view has become a sign for Venice, an image that supplements the narrative it accompanies. This iconic function is illustrated in one last example; a miniature image of the city appears on the frontispiece of Giacomo Franco's Hobiti delle donne veneziane, a series of engravings that illustrates Venetian female social types and rituals (Figure 8).31 The bird's-eye view is now framed in a circular cartouche that resembles a convex mirror.32 Emphasizing the desirability of the object, the mirror reflection focuses on the act of viewing, as if reflecting the image of Venice in the eye of the beholder. The frontispiece thereby allegorizes the Olympian view of the geographer's eye. In one of the dedications Franco explains his new concept, highlighting the startling impact of the world's expanded geography: Here. . .is the design. . .of the marvelous city of Venice in spherical form, a real portrait of the world. . .similar to the orb of the earth. . . One sees, even outside of the contained body of Venice, the Giudecca, in a guise that resembles the new world;. . . the districts [contrade] are in such a number, as are the provinces of the world.33 Franco has rotated the bird's-eye view of Venice about seventy-five degrees to the east and projected it on to a sphere, transforming the islands of Venice into the continents of the world. Giudecca with its terra incognita to the west represents the new world of America; Dorsoduro and San Polo are Europe; Cannaregio and Castello stand in for Asia and Africa respectively. Rialto occupies the position of Venice on world maps as the crossroads between continents. And San Marco is located on the crest of the globe, at the centre of the Venetian world, sited as the New Jerusalem. Through print, the city was re-envisioned: seen from the outside in. Readers open the book to see local costumes and customs, to see the world in Venice. Thus far I have suggested how the bird's-eye view was transformed into an icon, a sign that resembles the original but that also mobilizes the observer's interpretative skills. First, the embodied experience of moving through the city, made possible in the de'Barbari woodcut by its vast scale and mimetic realism, moved outside the frame, into the legend and details that surround the image.34 By the beginning of the seventeenth century, 31 Giacomo Franco, Habiti delle donne veneziane intagliate in rame nuovamente da Giacomo Franco (Venice, 1614).

In city maps, as we have seen, the traditional value of resemblance remains crucial for the image's status as an icon; even</page><page sequence="15">Venice, print, and the early modern icon 53 though it is reduced in scale and detail, the likeness still refers back to the series of images and associations that are condensed into it. This holds true for the costume illustrations as well. However, in contrast to the changes that occurred in printed maps, the images in costume books remained remarkably constant; here it is the focus on the contours of the figures, their social meaning and the dissemination of copies that forged their iconic status. Printmakers in the Véneto were particularly enthusiastic for this new genre; nine costume books were published there between 1540 and 1610, about one third of those produced in Europe.35 Cesare Vecellio, for example, whose famous books were published in Venice in 1590 and 1598, reproduced some 600 costumes from around the world.36 He used as many as 60 plates to illustrate the attire of Venetians, the city where he lived himself. Vecellio was among those who presented a different costume on each page (Figure 15) but several illustrators engraved multiple costumes on folded folio sheets in an atlas-like format. For example, both Abraham de Bruyn and Jean Jacques Boissard used the large sheets to demonstrate that costumes from a given centre could be identified on the basis of shared visual characteristics (Figure 9). 37 A variety of attire was also depicted on single sheets, and I use Ambrogio Brambilla's folio engraving here to introduce some of the visual strategies that are also characteristic of printed series (Figure 10, detail).38 Female figures are arranged in four horizontal rows that begin with three examples from Rome and conclude with Indiana and Calicvtica. Throughout the sheet, the 28 figures are identified by labels and the same profile is used for each place of origin, thereby setting the sartorial characteristics into relief. The standard format not only designates costume as the marker of difference, but also calls attention to similarities among Italian and European costumes. Fantastic headwear and hemlines, such as the endless brim sported by Egyptia and the three-tiered tower on Arabia, highlight peculiarities imagined for distant lands. The relation between the contours of the costumes and the composition of the sheet as a whole would thereby have highlighted bonds with neighbours. Viewers from Venice, for instance, would have identified more easily with Roman or Florentine attire than with the more articulated gestures and garments worn by those from distant lands. The conventions would have enabled Italians to compare their dresses to those of other locales, screening out the details that protruded beyond the contained contours of those costumes found in European centres. 35 See ibid., chapter 2. 30 For a translation of Vecellio's 1590 edition, see the forthcoming book by Margaret Rosenthal and Ann Jones. 37 Abraham de Bruyn, Omnium poene Gentium Imagines (Cologne, 1577). 38 On the print, see Wilson, World in Venice, 74-6.</page><page sequence="16">54 Urban History Figure 9: Jean Jacques Boissard, Venetian Women, Habitus variarum orbis gentium (Mechlin(?), 1581), engraving, oblong folio (photo: by permission of the British Library, London) 146.i.lO In the sixteenth century, as demonstrated by hundreds of printed illustrations, it was less the body than what was worn over the skin that served as the locus of alterity. The necessity of this representational strategy is pointed out by Nicolas de Nicolay, geographer to the French king, in his Navigations et pérégrinations orientales. First published in Lyon in 1567 following Nicolay's extensive travels through the Ottoman Empire, the book was enormously influential; all subsequent illustrators replicated the costumes and poses. The book contains 60 'portraits' of men and women from a diversity of regions that the author claims were drawn from life. The costumes are highlighted by the absence of any setting, and the placement of the figures close to the picture plane. These sartorial differences, as Nicolay stresses in his preface, were all the more significant in view of the natural order of the world. In contrast to animals, which 'are confined according to species . . . and elements that are natural to them', humans are able to extend their domain, discovering a world beyond 'the country of one's birth ... in all those habitable lands and navigable seas'. 'This is great evidence', explains the author, 'that man is the only animal that was made for all the world.'39 In the wake of discoveries of worlds unknown 39 Nicolas de Nicolay, Les Quatre premiers livres des navigations et peregrinations orientales (Lyon, 1568), preface.</page><page sequence="17">Venice, print, and the early modern icon 55 Figure 10: Detail of engravings by Ambrogio Brambilla (after Battista da Parma), first published by Claudio Duchet in Rome around 1590 (photo: by permission of the British Library, London) 146.i.lO to Europeans, then, and in striking contrast with the regional variations seen in flora or fauna, the contours of the human body, unexpectedly, and perhaps surprisingly, appeared to be universal.

In 1581 De Bruyn's illustration was copied by Jean Jacques Boissard in his series that was printed in Lyon (centre, Figure 9). In turn, Boissard's figure was traced, to which the identical scale and mirror image of the copy attest, by the engraver of a printed Album Amicorum (Figure 11). This album, a form of traveller's journal to which I will return, was first published in Leuven in 1599 and subsequently reprinted in 1601 and 1605. Even the Venetian artist Vecellio adopted the figure for his woodcuts, using the familiar silhouette for both the Venetian Virgin and the Bride before her Marriage 41 Copying was not always slavish however. For example, Pietro Bertelli, whose first volume of costumes was published in Padua in 1589, played with the perceptions of foreigners whose chronicles record their fascination with female types (Figure 12). The Venetian Virgin was much discussed and in Figure 12 Bertelli plays with the contradictory image of marriageable girls who 'do walke abroad with their breastes all naked',42 but also 'go 40 On the exactly reproducible statement see Williams M.

As these examples indicate, the Venetian Virgin signified a civic social type, and that idea circulated through print. Orderly classification of peoples from around the world required a systematic format and illustrators had a variety of sources on which to draw. Artists' model books are one example as sheets from a fifteenth- century north-east Italian manuscript demonstrate. On one page, six famous men are arranged on two rows and identified by labels. They are positioned equally close to the picture plane and apart from each other with no background, a convention that enabled artists to copy the figures into different contexts.44 In the costume books, by contrast, these conventions facilitated classification and supported claims to objectivity and encyclopaedic knowledge. De Bruyn makes the analogy with scientific illustration explicit in the preface of his costume book.45 Moreover his own zoological engravings demonstrate that it was form and surface patterns that were used to classify fauna.46 Print media were also ideal for representing the characteristic features of plants, and botanical illustration evolved to facilitate the identification of flora in the field.47 Here, too, artists drew on general characteristics instead of particulars; the portrait of a type was delineated with graphic precision and identified by a name. Botanical illustrations also found their way into emblem books, a genre that was popularized by Andrea Alciati whose collections of symbols and pithy statements appeared in 75 editions before 1570.48 A variety of foliage is depicted on pages toward the end of the 1564 edition of his Diverse imprese accommodate a diverse moralità. Here the analogy between flora and costume figures is particularly striking. Each tree has been extracted from the ground, identified with a label and brief verse, and surrounded by an elaborate frame. This format is emulated in many costume books including Vecellio's woodcuts, where the figures stand alone, cut from their urban context as if plants pulled from the ground (Figure 15). 43 Casóla, Canon Pietro Casola's Pilgrimage, 145. 44 The manuscript (Rome, Istituto Nazionale della Grafica, inv. no.

However, some Venetian figures clearly resonated more than others, as evidence from travellers to Venice illustrates. Earlier I noted that artists like Pietro Bertelli were responding, in part, to the impressions of visitors that circulated in chronicles. The Venetian Virgin was iconic because the social type had become a topos, a figure that stands in for that other rhetorical commonplace: liberty. 'Preserved' from foreign domination, as one contemporary put it, the city was 'verginea'.49 The Virgin was only one of the Venetian types who became an icon; the doge, dogaressa and courtesan were also ubiquitous in printed costume books and albums of travellers from north of the Alps. In contrast to printed costume books, which offered the viewer vicarious travel, the Album Amicorum, or Stammbuch (friendship album), was typically small and oblong and carried by its owner, often students from northern Europe, who journeyed to universities away from home.50 Alciati's Emblemata was one of the most popular books for albums and editions were printed with blank sheets to collect signatures of friends, coats of arms and also costume illustrations. Many books offered religious inspiration and moral guidance, such as Philipp Melanchthon's Loci communes theologici , while others were bound from blank pages.51 On one level, students could reflect on the motivational ideas conveyed in the pictures, texts and comments inscribed by their professors and colleagues; as one publisher advertised, the reader 'will see himself in it as in the Socratic mirror, and will find what defects in himself he must improve'.52 He also noted that Schädtbücher (books causing mischief) might be a more accurate description than Stammbücher. In fact ludic content appears frequently in the imagery and the list of signatures could be used for drinking games. Sociability was important and the books functioned as passports, since an illustrious signature could open doors.53 Signatures of friends - presented in the company of emblems, costumes, allegories, 49 Girolamo Priuli, I diarii (1494-1512), ed.

The prominence of vestments from Venice, where there was no university, offers clues with which to understand the function of costume illustrations more generally. Illuminated in brilliant gouache colours, and typically accompanied by a motto and signature, the images convey the impression they are painted from life, as if figures seen in the flesh by the signatory or the owner. However, to use the case of the dogaressa as an example: her popularity in the images bore little relation to the real experiences of visitors, since between the public festivities for the coronations of Zilia Dandolo Priuli in 1557 and Morosina Morosini Grimani in 1597, when most of the manuscript and printed illustrations considered here were made, there was no wife of a doge to be seen. Figures of the dogaressa in two albums illustrated here demonstrate that artists were copying the same models; the style of the illustrators varies, but the cloth- ing, poses and gestures attest to the use of shared prototypes (compare Figures 13 and 14). Similarly, Vecellio's woodcut of the Venetian Cortigiana replicates the gestures, attire and silhouette seen in an illuminated example (Figure 15). Like the printed books, manuscript costumes were also drawn from memory and copied from earlier models. The professional quality of many of the painted illustrations indicates they were produced by</page><page sequence="22">60 Urban History Figure 15: Cesare Vecellio, Cortigiana , De gli habiti antichi, et moderni (Venice, Damian Zenaro, 1590), woodcut, 8o, 20 cm (photo: Museo Correr, Venice) Cortegiana Venetiana from an Album Amicorum, manuscript, watercolour, gouache, ink (photo: by permission of the British Library, London) MS Egerton 1191 document illuminators and printmakers for whom the use of pattern books was a familiar workshop practice.54 Emblem books were used for albums, as noted above, and the concept sheds light on how social types - people - could become urban icons. In emblem books, abstract concepts are personified by a person, typically a woman, whose costume and attributes are explained in an accompanying text. There is of course a long history of personifying virtues and vices, but emblems in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries are often complicated allegories, a new visual language that needed the text as a key. Emblems were frequently illustrated in friendship albums, usually without this text since the owner would have learned the more cryptic details which he could then explain to inquiring friends. In an Album Amicorum, figures of Detractio and Veritas are painted on the verso and recto of two pages and thus stand across from each other (Figure 16). The moral contest is clear to the uninitiated observer, since the billowing garments of one figure reveal substantial flesh, whereas the other is decorously clad in a toga. On the level of their attributes, however, the emblems address a more knowledgeable viewer. Veritas carries a burning heart to signify her virtue; the two-faced figure of Detractio sprouts a slanderous 54 Rosenheim traced more than 50 document illuminators and woodcutters in Nuremberg between 1550 and 1600, some of whose marks appear in the albums.

He attributes their success to the ways in which they distilled experience into visual images, thereby enabling the world to be classified and ordered.58 The costume figures, which were collected in albums alongside emblems, operated in a similar way. Earlier I proposed that the Venetian Virgin functioned as a symbol of the city's own virginal state; the Virgin had become a sign for an abstract idea, a sign that also prompts a chain of associations with moral values, such as chastity, and also desire and beauty, all ideas that could be paralleled with the city itself, which the 55 Cesare Ripa describes Detraction in Iconologia : or, Moral Emblems (London, 1709), p. 22, fig. 86.

The costume images are symbolic, but the process is short-circuited, as it were, since the referent - the social type - is present in the picture. Thus the icon works on two levels: as a representation, since political, moral and civic concepts have been translated into emblems, but also like a portrait, because the icon resembles people who were understood to inhabit the city. Thus for northerners, who collected Venetian costumes in their albums, what mattered was more likely the figure's allegorical function. The dogaressa was a 'walking Idea',59 'a feminine symbol of domestic virtue', the apex of patrician luxury, constancy and the ideal wife.60 The veiled Virgin and the courtesan were equally popular among owners of albums. Where the courtesan, in Margaret Rosenthal's words, 'embodied the city immersed in luxury, spectacle, disguise, commercialization, voluptuousness, and sensuality', the Virgin signified Venice's immaculate origins, chastity and republican longevity, all preserved from foreign domination.61 Thus the dogaressa, Virgin and courtesan, in tandem with the male types - doge, senator and rettore - responded to the image of Venice as it was perceived by foreigners, as modest, veiled, concupiscent, exotic, sober and austere.62 By collecting foreign types alongside the signatures and arms of their associates, these albums would have enabled travellers to shape their own experiences of the world into a moral cosmography. Understood in this context, the function of illustrations in printed costume books and in maps come into sharper focus. In Giacomo Franco's map, as we saw at the beginning of this article, a cartouche containing the doge and dogaressa sits below a bird's-eye view of Venice (Figure 1). The engraving commemorates a specific event, and thus contemporaries would have identified the doge as Marin Grimani, who the likeness resembles, and his consort, Morosina Morosini. But the couple can also be understood, as I suggested, as an emblem of the domestic and political order that underpins the civic harmony represented in the map and legend. In costume books the figures are not supported by the urban framework for which they stand in and the resulting legibility contributes to their efficacy as symbols. The city views that make up the six volumes of the Civitates orbis terrarum (1572-1618) referred to earlier are an exception that proves the rule. Many contributing artists incorporated figures in the foreground that were copied from costume books.63 To make the 59 On the chaneine of personalities into allegories see Fletcher, Allegory, 26-8. 60 As Ernesto Masi described the dogaressa, she was the 'simbolo femminile della virtù domestica'.

The plan of Cologne, for example, features a river that runs horizontally along the upper part of the sheet. The city extends in a wide arc below the river and a small half-circle of the urban structure appears above. This distinctive plan has been paralleled for formal effect by the prominent wide circular collars worn by a man and two women pictured on the lower left. Francis Hogenberg's view of Piazza San Marco is another example from the Civitates in which local apparel and architecture are made to resemble each other. Here the artist has drawn analogies between the domes of the church, the turbans of Muslim visitors and the breasts of the courtesans in the foreground. The parallels are subtle, but consistent; throughout the atlases of the Civitates illustrators adjusted the costumes, architecture, topography and even local livestock to demonstrate geographical commensurability. By bringing together bird's-eye views and costumes, Giuseppe Rosaccio's 1607 engraving Abiti antichi et moderni d'Italia illustrates the shared conventions of both (Figure 17).

The chorographic grid of details, like the serial format of books of city views and costume books, would have encouraged observers to compare the examples with each other and thereby to learn the salient features of each. Rosaccio's caption describes the figures as abiti , the contemporary term for costume. Derived from the Latin habitus , or aspect, the word signified the ways in which apparel invested bodies with meaning through the quality of the fabric and the tradition and conventions attached to dress.65 The word is also defined as contegno , meaning attitude and behaviour and thereby conveying those attitudes to which people are inclined habitually or innately. Abiti , then, identified those aspects of clothing that were aligned with place, and these were the ideals inscribed in the costume prints: the social roles and characteristics that distinguished regional diversity across time. In this article I have been emphasizing the visual strategies that developed in these early prints to engage viewers in new ways. Maps and costume books constituted a sudden and pervasive experience with alterity that redefined the relation of Europeans to their place in the world and forcefully shaped their perceptions of it. In the printed maps the increasing emphasis on information surrounding city views prompted the viewer to mediate between the text and the image. The impact of this exchange would have depended upon the novelty of the repeated experiences of looking at images in tandem with the didactic effect of the visual conventions. These strategies forged the iconic status of both the bird's-eye view and costume figure; by translating embodied experiences of the city into images, prints condensed particulars into visual ideas. These prints communicated concepts about the republic to foreigners, but this process was also a reflexive one, a process that would have altered Venetians' perceptions of their place in the city. Evidence of such effects, or resistance to them, requires situating printed imagery within the wider representational and social system in which they operated; urban planning for example, and efforts to legislate the appearances of Venetians and foreigners in the city through sumptuary legislation and the Inquisition, were among those experiences that overlapped with visual imagery. This social history is beyond the scope of this article, but I hope to have shown that this reciprocity is inscribed in the images, in the iconography and forged through the medium. Projected outside the city, but tethered to it by the toponyms and social categories that identified their place within it, Venetians may have begun to recognize themselves in the picture. Inhabitants may have identified with the images, resisted them or been excluded by them, but it is this double-sided operation that emerges as characteristic of the early modern urban icon. 65 Dizionario dell Lingua Italiana (Florence, 1971), 9.</page></plain_text>
