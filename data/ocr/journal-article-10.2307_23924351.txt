University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006. Pp. xxii, 464; 16 color illus., 168 black-and-white illus. The publication in 1898 of the first monograph dedicated to the now well known Sarajevo Haggadah, a manuscript produced in northeastern Spain during the early decades of the fourteenth century to accompany the Passover liturgy, inaugurated the scientific study of illuminated Jewish manuscripts produced dur ing the Middle Ages.1 Over the subsequent century-and-a-bit, the Sarajevo Hag gadah was approached principally through the limiting lens of questions central to Jewish studies: what, exactly, is "Jewish" about "Jewish Art" and how does this manuscript, along with the others frequently grouped with it, manifest this mythic "Jewishness"? Such concerns are, likewise, mirrored in earlier scholarship's almost obsessive preoccupation with the identification of Late Antique sources for the later medieval manifestations of the phenomenon—indeed, the argument of "Jewish ness," as is often the case in nationalistic or ethnocentric studies of culture, depended on this "continuity." Though much of medieval art history abandoned these meth odologies decades ago, as Katrin Kogman-Appel demonstrates (with commendable evenhandedness, as well as copious bibliography) in the introduction to her study, such approaches have remained typical in the somewhat isolated corner of the dis cipline Jewish manuscript studies had staked out for itself. Kogman-Appel wastes no time in separating herself from these practices and assumptions. The book makes two contributions of particular importance. First, Kogman-Appel successfully and firmly returns not only the Sarajevo Haggadah but also each of the Spanish Hag gadot she examines to the visual and historical contexts from which they proceed, dedicating careful attention both to similarities and differences between individual manuscripts and to the group as a whole. Second, and perhaps more importantly— though this is not a specifically stated aim of the book—it opens up this rather insulated group of extremely interesting objects to dialogue with the rest of late medieval European and Mediterranean visual culture. The first chapter is devoted to the introduction of the seven Passover books, each of which opens with an introductory cycle of images depicting selected bib lical narratives, which will be the subjects of the chapters to follow, beginning with matters of codicology, paleography, textual variants, quality, size, and format. The author departs from the premise that the similarities in style and iconography which have previously been invoked as justification for studying these manuscripts</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 247 as a coherent (and, indeed, closed) group should be revisited with care, though in the end she does locate them all along a continuous geographic and chronological horizon: Cataluña and Aragón during the first half of the fourteenth century, during the reigns of Jaime II and Alfonso IV. Each of the following three chapters offers a detailed consideration of a pair of related Haggadot, beginning with the Golden Haggadah and British Library, Or. 2884; chapters 3 and 4 are devoted to the Rylands Haggadah and British Library Or. 1404, and the Sarajevo Haggadah and the Bologna-Modena Mahzor, respec tively. In her discussion of the first pair, Kogman-Appel sets out to probe the dif ferences between the two books (which she demonstrates to be significant) as well as to speculate concerning the production processes that distinguished each one; similar methodology drives the following two chapters where, through a series of extended and well-conceived comparisons, the author meticulously considers the relationships between the Spanish Haggadot and their presumed models. These chapters revisit such canonical art historical notions as recensions and model books (of which no example has survived) as well as "motif books, generic guides, and iconographie (or pictorial) guides" (51) for a discussion of which art historians are on slightly firmer ground. In the end, Kogman-Appel rejects each of these pos sibilities on its own as a satisfactory explanation for the co-existence of numerous and striking similarities and equally undeniable differences. Instead, she coins the term "formal congruence" (53) to describe the iconographie and stylistic connec tions between the image program of a particular manuscript (or of individual ele ments within that image program) and a large and varied body of comparando with no firmly documentable relationship to the object of study, suggesting that most of the images she studies were generated by the artists themselves, who largely depended on their own memories of objects and/or motif books or collections that they had seen. Though the possibility certainly merits consideration, this argument is one of the weaker ones offered by Kogman-Appel, particularly given that it is proposed as a replacement for other equally unproven (and, ultimately, probably unprovable) theories. Much more intriguing (and convincing) is Kogman-Appel's distinction be tween the reactions of the Haggadot artists to their French and Italian models (56 72). Citing the notoriously unwelcoming climate with which the Ashkenazic Jews were confronted in France and northern Europe from the late thirteenth century forward, Kogman-Appel views input from French Bibles Moralisées as having been, though unmistakable, limited in comparison to the significant and varied influences she documents from an Italian context. Though she acknowledges, for example, the Sarajevo Haggadah's debt to French sources, she argues that the specifics of this connection are comparatively limited. She suggests, conversely, that the makers of British Library, Or. 1404 had direct access to Italian models but</page><page sequence="3">248 Reviews not to French ones, and that the connections are generalized throughout the image program—the images do not, in other words, necessarily depend on the artists' having had access to specific books, but rather to their intimate knowledge of an entire visual culture. The argument becomes particularly compelling when it is buttressed, in the conclusion to part 1, with observations concerning the degrees of acculturation and cultural interaction with Christians which would have been nec essary for motifs and techniques to be transferred from Christian to Jewish hands, whether in Italy or in Cataluña, and which characterized the position of Jews in Italian as well as in Catalan societies. Kogman-Appel is careful to demonstrate, however, that Christian sources were not copied slavishly but rather altered and adapted meaningfully, noting that, though it is not possible to identify a corpus of motifs that might be described as a specifically "Jewish" iconography, the visual programs of all the Spanish Haggadot, whether or not specific relationships may be demonstrated between them, tend to avoid the same themes, such as the repre sentation of God in anthropomorphic form. Part 2, subtitled "Meaning and Message," is of significant methodological importance and should be of great interest to scholars, not only of medieval art history but also of cultural interactions both in the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean world at large. In a detailed examination of the relationship between the visual programs both of the Spanish Haggadot and of illuminated Jewish manu scripts in general to midrash commentaries (essentially, exegesis of the Hebrew Bible—the tanakh—which includes legal, ritualistic, moralizing, folkloric, and anecdotal interpretation), Kogman-Appel takes on the truisms that have long held sway in extant scholarship, arguing forcefully against the existence of a continuous Jewish visual tradition derived from midrash literature with roots in Late Antique images and commentaries. She does uphold, however, the central importance of midrash literature to our understanding of these manuscripts, noting that the texts which would have been most influential in the context in question would have been of both home-grown and Ashkenazi provenance—all relatively recent. She cements the relationship, moreover, by noting that these texts would have been known— whether through actual reading or through oral transmission in the form, for example, of weekly sermons—to most members of any audience one might imagine for the manuscripts under consideration. The illustration programs, as might be expected, substantially "edit" the biblical texts most frequently interpreted as Christological in Christian contexts through the application of typology. Kogman-Appel, again in disagreement with some other scholarship, does not believe that these visual programs, though they may be related to texts originally composed with polemi cal intent in the face of an increasingly insistent onslaught of Christian attempts to convert Jews from the late thirteenth century forward, were themselves conceived with a specifically polemical intent vis-à-vis Christianity.</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 249 Rather, she suggests that the visual programs respond to polemical issues within the Jewish community itself. In Iberia earlier centuries had witnessed the almost complete acculturation of Jews and Jewish culture to an Islamic society, one whose intelligentsia was fascinated by the assimilation of philosophy and rationalism—ultimately of Greek derivation—to the exigencies of Islam. Just as Iberian Jews embraced many Arabic literary genres, topoi, and even stylistic fea tures and applied them to the creation of a body of literature which many spe cialists consider one of the high points of medieval Jewish culture, so did many Jewish scholars embrace the concepts of rationalism and attempt to apply them to religious questions. In so doing, they challenged—in a way viewed as dangerous by the more conservative elements of society—the midrash, the wisdom of the ancient rabbis and scholars heretofore considered unimpeachable. As the thirteenth century advanced, however, and as the balance of power in the Iberian peninsula shifted irrevocably toward the Christian states, the rationalist controversy reached its boiling point, provoking some members of the Jewish scholarly community— perhaps the best-known among them being Nachmanides (Rabbi Moshe ben Nach man, 1194-1270)—to return to the fundaments of midrashic commentary roundly rejecting rationalism in all its forms. Kogman-Appel convincingly relates the pro duction and illustration of the Spanish Haggadot, with their renewed emphasis on a literal and historical understanding of the scriptures, to this larger cultural phe nomenon. These manuscripts, however, betray no input from the other important body of critics of the rationalist position, the Kabbalists, and Kogman-Appel attri butes this to the controversial nature of many of the Aggadah preferred by these mystics—the aristocratic or upper middle-class and scholarly patrons she proposes for these manuscripts were possibly concerned with orthodoxy. Kogman-Appel is careful to note that these image programs were purely didactic in intention and that no devotional function should be imputed to them. It is, however, certainly worthy of much further discussion among readers of this important study that prominent among the tools to which the patrons of the Spanish Haggadot had most ready recourse in their rejection of rationalist discourse and concomitant embrace of tra ditional exegesis were extensive programs of images.
