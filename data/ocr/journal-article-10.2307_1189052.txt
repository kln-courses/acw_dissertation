<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imaging Women's Spirituality E. LISBETH DONALDSON Interest in how women might be understood as human beings with a "spark of the divine" that can evoke creative and political action has inspired discourse generated by the women's movement. During the past 20 years, new insights about problems (victimization, marginalization) and about potential (public achievement that is recognized, private in- sights that heal) have contributed to perceptions of women's values and behaviors as normative, as being normal even when they differ from those of men.' From this strong beginning, more and more women-centered publications are attracting a broad base of support and have contributed to the ongoing development of many who consider them- selves experienced teachers. Recently, several new videos have stimulated controversial responses, perhaps because they present such immediate visual imagery that viewers cannot fail to become emotionally involved in the discussion. Some media examples are reviewed here, together with a summary of selected writings that represent new images of women's spirituality. They offer educators exciting curricular alternatives for encouraging student development and help to counter some of the negative effects of backlash. Director Donna Read's successful Canadian National Film Board (NFB) trilogy, God- dess Remembered, The Burning Times, and Full Circle, about women and spirituality provides ' Charlene Spretnak, ed., The Politics of Women's Spirituality: Essays by Founding Mothers of the Movement (New York: Anchor Doubleday, 1994).

This image of ourselves as holy or whole human beings, a woman-centered image at the core of ourselves, fre- quently is symbolized by the Goddess. "Many people today use the word 'Goddess' as a metaphor-a way of symbolizing a concept that is positive for women, politically and psychologically. Others speak of the goddess as immanent, present in the world today; the spark of divinity within themselves. Some say that knowledge of the Goddess ignites their creative impulses."3 Whatever the motivation, more and more women throughout the world are responding to female aesthetic and spiritual imagery that evokes high-level values within themselves and, consequently, assists them to value themselves more highly. The forces thereby unleashed have so much strength and power that throughout the ages, people have died for such beliefs. The spiritual impulse may do more to unite women and the men who listen to them than anger toward injustice or a political stance with regard to equity. The Goddess metaphor appeals to increasing numbers of women because it is an image that evokes women's history, it empowers, and it illumines creativity. Women have often lacked mentorship in each of these spheres. Just as the disguised Goddess Athena mentored Telemachus, ancient Odyessus' son who watched over the family while the father was absent, today women are turning to the Goddess as "mentrix," an image inspiring them to interpret their experience of being female.4 Nevertheless, this quest is a heroine's journey evoking shyness and vulnerability; thus, for many Western women it is easier to use some form of symbolism other than that of a woman. However, the power of guided imagery is well known to sports competitors, especially to swimmers, figure skaters, and skiers. In addition, business people and other professionals, such as teachers, are encouraged to develop a vision and to be clear about their mission so that they can achieve their goals. Why then should women be excluded from envisioning themselves as having a spiritual core which radiates their lives? This brief discussion summarizes some thoughts about women-centered spirituality and what might be the effect of such "imaging" or "imagining" on children, especially girls. The demographic realities of this century, recent scholarship about women's history, probes of both physical and social scientists, creativity of artists, multicultural traditions, and the very human desire to know ourselves better all contribute insights that illumine both the personal and the collective journeys of those who image women as spirit and with spirit. DEMOGRAPHICS The last decade of a century is a vantage position from which to view changes that have occurred during a period slightly longer than current Western expectations of a normal life span. Caught up in claims of being 50 percent of the population, many women 2 Donna Read's video trilogy was completed in 1989, 1990, and 1993 and is available from the NFB marketing offices in Ottawa and the United States for approximately Can$75.

Women over 50, some of them well educated, often have a sense of shock when, as a result of recent scholarship about women's lives, they recognize their marginalization, particularly in Western history. The immediacy of so many issues connected with the women's movement (child abuse, single parenting, poverty, accessibility to education and employment) has often blurred the impact of longer-term changes. However, demographic shifts during the past hundred years comprise the roots in which the women's movement of the twentieth century is grounded. Perhaps an example from Canada, a country in which women are advantaged relative to most other nations, helps illustrate the point. Many women elsewhere in the globe currently live in conditions that Canadian women experienced at the beginning of this century; the lifestyles and demographic patterns of non-Western women are only begin- ning to reflect the substantial changes that have rapidly transformed Western cultures, and educators have had a major facilitative role. The fourth census of Canada, conducted in 1901, reported that among a total population of 5,300,000 citizens, the ratio of females aged 15-45 years was 124 per 1,000 people.5 "Accidents of pregnancy" and "puerperal conditions" were the major causes of death among women aged 15-45 and contributed to deaths among women aged 14 years and 45-54 years. These figures exclude other common causes of death such as tuberculosis and circulatory diseases, and according to the report, actual mortality rates may have been as much as 10 percent higher. The gender balance that had been reported at birth between newborn babies and younger children changed after puberty; many men in midlife were left widowers with young children. By midcentury, between the 1920s and the 1970s, maternal mortality rates had dropped from 5 percent each year to 0.2 percent or less per year, while neonatal death rates had dropped from more than 40 per 1,000 births to fewer than 12. That is, fewer mothers died, and more babies lived. By the final decade of the century, the number of live births per 1,000 population had dropped to 14. Canadian women are having fewer children, later in life, and the number of children a woman is expected to have during her lifetime is fewer than two, a number lower than the rate at which the population perpetuates itself. While people are still marrying at the same rate as they did 75 years ago, they are waiting until they are older; 28 percent of the marriages end in divorce; and 70 percent of divorced Canadians eventually remarry. Since midcentury, the changes in family lifestyles have been profound; smaller families, urban careers, divorce, and public benefit systems are but a few of the dynamics affecting Canadians and their educa- tional systems. There are now more women alive between the ages of 35 and 50 (midlife cycle) than ever before in human history, and many have relatively greater education, money, and independence than previously. They fight to be accepted in societies that have been modeled on male career paths, male power structures, and male value systems, and these women are winning their battles. Whether perceived as a "critical mass" or as a "gen- derquake," these women are literally changing the cultures in which we live.' The long- 5 Demographic data were prepared by Statistics Canada.

However, like many first waves of human change, the vision is cloudy, confused, and contradictory. Change is cyclic, and points of clarity are often subsequently muddied by foggy goals. One of the more simplistic aspects of the women's movement is a tendency to label some attributes, such as an interest in relationships, as gender-specific behavior. Considerable diversity is evident. For instance, differences between REAL women who espouse traditional values and EGALE lesbian activists appear greater than similarities except for one focus: women committed to each organization want more recognition for women's rights as exemplified by their lived experiences and lifestyles. What is healthy in this political activity is an agenda based on women's images of themselves, even when the images are vastly different from one another. From this activity women are acquiring a sense of history and developing a stronger sense of identity. These changes, however, need to be validated by inclusive curricula and insightful teachers. WOMEN'S HISTORY Read's video trilogy is a well-edited documentary summarizing highlights of scholarship about women's history, emphasizing Western culture which, being more "civilized," has been more repressive with regard to female goddesses. The concept was initiated by Studio D of the Canadian National Film Board, the only such women's studio in the world; Read, a freelance editor with Studio D since 1981, was asked to direct the project. The first video of the series, Goddess Remembered, visualizes an almost forgotten heri- tage: our foremothers. Interdisciplinary interpretations of neolithic symbolism have gener- ated an argument that a nonviolent, earth-centered, "gylanic" culture evolved during the millennia that preceded the Bronze Age (3500-3000 B.C.).7 This peaceful, creative, gen- der-equitable culture apparently persisted in such Mediterannean island cultures as Crete and Malta until 1500 B.C. In continental Europe, however, wars based on territoriality and trade moved tribes into larger and larger units of social organization that were patterned increasingly on male dominance. Nevertheless, among rural women, Goddess cults per- sisted. The technology of print literacy eventually assisted priests in negating the last vestiges of female religious practices during a period in which medicine became a profes- sion (A.D. 1350-1750). The early "Great Goddess" was a life-giver, a transformer, and a destroyer-more than maiden, mother, and crone. In Western history, the midwife or witch became inverted into a negative character, but, originally, she symbolized an inter- connectedness with life on earth that late twentieth-century ideologues are once again beginning to appreciate. If identification with such early manifestations of the divine, meaning the mysteries and the unknowns and our resultant humility in the face of our ignorance, leads to "living more wisely on the Earth," then why not develop personal rituals that become political action? This approach is suggested by Charlene Spretnak, who believes that an awareness of women's spirituality focuses attention on the dynamics of interconnectedness.8 How- ever, warns Janet Biehl, if ecofeminism restricts itself to metaphors that elaborate only the qualities of "caring and nurturing," the consequence will not be "liberatory," but limiting: "What of goals such as consciousness, reason, and above all, freedom?"'9 And, what 7 Sources used in the video include two of the most influential scholars in this field: Marija Gimbutas, The Language of the Goddess (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1989); and Raine Eisler, The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1987). 8 Charlene Spretnak, The Spiritual Dimension of Green Politics (Santa Fe, Calif.: Bear &amp; Co., 1986). 9 Janet Biehl, Finding Our Way: Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1991), p. 25 (Biehl's italics).

They quest for symbols through which they might explore answers to questions about how to more meaningfully live their lives. Read's second video, The Burning Times, is painful to watch. Between 1350 and 1750 in Europe, thousands of women were tortued, burned, and put to death because of confessions extracted following guidelines in the handbook Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of witches), used by inquisitors. Although this tape is not print-referenced, academic sources interviewed for the documentary claim it was "the women's holocaust" with a "high estimate of 9 million" killed over a period of 300 years, 85 percent of whom were women. As part of the renunciation of women's wisdom, festivals honoring life-death connections, such as the October Hallowed Evening, became travesties mocking older women denigrated as hags and witches. With such an inversion of representations of women's knowledge, according to historian Barbara Ehrenreich, "It is difficult to find our own voice and hard to remain true to it.""11 Read herself has learned just how difficult the struggle can be. Production of the third tape was postponed, delayed, and nearly prevented by NFB internal bureaucratic changes and external pressure led by the president of the Catholic Civil Rights League who complained to his member of Parliament and obtained a review from the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission in 1991.12 Constant lobbying by individuals and support from women's groups resulted in its production and distribution, an effort acknowledged by the long list of credits on the tape and cover. Over $100,000 was raised privately, and, unlike the first two tapes, production credits are shared between the NFB and the Great Atlantic and Pacific Film Company, Read's company. The NFB received more than 1,000 letters asking for the tape, which was released in the United States 1 year before Canadian distribution. In Alberta, the first tape of Full Circle was received in late 1993, an arrival welcomed by many women, but creating negative reactions among others who immediately destroyed at least one copy. A tribute also should be paid to the men whose careers have been affected by the series. One such example is Mathew Fox who, though no longer a Dominican priest, continues to teach creation-centered spirituality. In the 10 years it took to complete the trilogy, Read passed through all of the classical stages of a mythical quest. She met goals, survived challenges, and returned triumphant. As commentator on the final tape, Read observes that she has come fall circle herself: while she was not always comfortable with some of the rituals, on-site filming in eight countries exposed her to the artifacts of past Goddess worship, to modern rituals, and to cultures where the connection has been less disrupted than that of Western heritage. As a consequence, she believes that "the Earth is alive" and that the common ground of all life is Planet Earth. Full Circle represents, then, the efforts of some women leaders to envision a future more filled with possibilities, with less energy spent on survival, and more integration of our personal and collective stories. 10 Raine Eisler, "The Goddess of Nature and Spirituality: An Ecomanifesto," in In All Her Names, ed.

This "heroine's journey" is a model for living, as writes another feminist, Maureen Murdock: "We are a pilgrim people, we are on ajourney together to learn how to honor and preserve the dignity of all life forms seen and unseen, therein lies our heroic power."'" If the cultural image of our times is that of the blue planet floating in space, then the nurturing of that planet is partially women's responsibility. This coming of age of the women's movement goes beyond a search for roots and past symbol- ism. It is pervading the scientific culture and inspiring artists. SCIENTIFIC PROBES A very different Canadian video, The Chilly Climate, documents the alienation many women experience at universities as they acquire postsecondary credentials, particularly in sci- ence.14 The drift of talented women away from the physical sciences is a concern that affects everyone in society. In addition to "the drift from" is a concern about achievement, a movement toward maximizing creativity. Gender differences in creative achievement may be as much environmental as biological, according to psychologists. Over a period of 10 years, a colleague in the department of chemistry has noted gender differences between the way males and females learn organic chemistry." After exposure to three-dimensional models and practice in spatial manipulation, females im- proved more than did males in term tests. An ability to conceptualize chemical models in three dimensions is apparently related to academic performance: differences in spatial abilities affected grades by as much as 7 percent, and women quickly narrowed the gap after working with spatial models. In 1991, when first-year students were asked to rate their level of competence in academic skills, girls ranked themselves significantly lower than boys in thinking and reasoning, problem solving, and visualization, but better in planning and organizing and time management. While males preferred learning with visual aids, females preferred small group discussions. In another study, although grades dropped equally among both male and female entry-level university students, 50 percent of female scholarship science students did not reapply for their grants, while males did apply to continue as scholarship students.'" These data suggest that men and women may learn subject material differently and thus may develop quite different perceptual "worlds." If scientific knowledge and decision making are based on male perceptions and male priorities, it is possible that science, as presently construed, represents a version of the world that is gender-biased. Among ecofeminists, arguments are made that this male bias contributes to an imbalance based on exploiting natural resources and stockpiling weaponry, thus continuing the paradigm in which the secrets of Mother Nature are "teased and tortured" out of her, as Francis Bacon once wrote during the Renaissance.,7 An argument could also be made that until women learn to image and to visualize concepts in at least three dimensions, they will live in a flat world that excludes them from full "1 Maureen Murdock, The Heroine's Journey (Boston: Shambhala, 1990), p. 183.

Furthermore, these results should be a call to arms for teachers, whether female or male. In the social sciences, evidence is mounting that "forming images in the mental eye" is somehow connected to creative thinking.'8 While the debate rages about biological brain differences versus socially mediated development and environmental influences, it seems that girls who experience a "tomboy" phase have more developed spatial abilities. Other environmental or cultural influences such as a lack of time and money or a dependent need for approval impede achievement. As any mature woman will attest, exclusion from the corridors of education is exclusion from the corridors of power. As well, a lack of role models does not boost self-confidence in situations where assertation or aggression wins the day (or the research grant). Finally, women's cultural values have emphasized procreation rather than creation. Creativity appears to require a balance between self-confidence (a belief in one's talent) and self-worth (a belief in one's value) that seems to have been more often a male than a female struggle, perhaps because, as some suggest, mothering is an effective creative act for many women. However, it is a creative act that no longer consumes so much of a woman's full-time life span, as the statistics quoted earlier confirm. Another consideration is the characteristic of male persistance (literal single-mindedness, some would argue) which may foster achievement through several crucial stages of the creative process. Although the nature-versus-nurture discussion is unlikely to be resolved in this cen- tury, changing demographics, personal expectations, and gender opportunities are likely to influence behavior, and possibly scientific careers, as much as any current theory about women's abilities to conceptualize abstract models and then to imagine possible applications. In other words, we are the generations that are walking the talk. And, as always, the artists among us listen to echoes from the past while trying to envision a better future. ARTISTIC CREATIVITY Scientific probings, based on the ability to envision symbols in three dimensions, require discipline and creativity. Is it possible there are relationships between that type of visioning and artistic discipline and creativity? Is it possible that imaging a women-centered spiritual- ity, the having a "spark of the divine," would help women to perceive themselves as creators, whether scientific or artistic? Read's artistry with a visual medium is but one expression of how Goddess imagery is inspiring creative women. Two other examples are provided in the stories of Roberta Rees and the music of Marsha Epstein. Rees is a 1993 Calgary Cityscope Honour Roll winner, the first Markin-Flanagan Distinguished Writer in Residence at the University of Calgary, and winner of several prestigious writing awards. In her short story, "Ethel Mermaid," the narrator knows the cardboard cutout mermaid is "not an idol, this Mermaid is not for worship, God," but, in the beam of a flashlight as she rises out of the water, "I swear I hear her sing, I swear her lips tremble all the way across the river into dark trees, I see the li-i-ight, I see the li-i-ght."'9 With deft humor, Ethel Merman's lusty joy of living has been transformed into an anthropomorphic Goddess, a mermaid who models laughter, love, and life-eternal characteristics of the female trinity. 18 Jock Abra and Suzanne Valentine-French, "Gender Differences in Creative Achievement," A Survey of Explanations: Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs 17, no. 3 (August 1991): 233-84. 19 Roberta Rees read her unpublished short story, "Ethel Mermaid," at the Laudes Matris Benefit, Alberta Vocational Centre, Calgary, on February 15, 1994. 200 May 1996</page><page sequence="8">MEDIA REVIEWS Epstein, a specialist in medieval music, sought the face of the "mother-God" as a composer. Her work, Laudes Matris (In praise of God the Mother) is a five-part chorale, derived from ancient Gnostic, Sumerian, Chinese, medieval, and modern prose adapted for a 30-woman choir with accompaniment. "The journey of rediscovery, then, is a process of looking forward to what is missing from our spiritual vocabulary, looking backward to search for models, then forward again to begin living with the assembled case of per- sonnae."20 In addition to the words, the music itself has been drawn from pretonal musical heritages as well as twentieth-century sprechstimme-chanting techniques, and the resultant offertory of women's talents to women's spirituality is enthralling. However, the struggle to ensure the production of women's creative work for other audiences continues while the recording of women's intellectual history is in its infancy.21 In her documentaries, Read asks her sources, "How did you get started?" Frequently the response is literary; an early source, Robert Graves's influential White Goddess is specifically mentioned. I "got started" because of Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon.22 If everything in nature is recycled (i.e., usable in some form), then I had never found plausible answers to my questions about God, the Holy Spirit, and women's divinity until I read of women priestesses who knew how to open the gates "between the worlds." Charlotte Spivack writes of the distinctively feminine "new enchanted quest," fantasy worlds created by women that suggest preferable modes of reality. They are modern metaphors for "the search for meaning, for identity," metaphorical worlds that have complex human beings, both male and female, who use their powers to sustain ecologically balanced cultures.23 As this brief overview suggests, research in both the physical and social sciences demon- strates that the ability to image, to visualize a model, is essential to creative achievement. Such artists as Read, Rees, and Epstein use their media to create their vision and to share their images, helping others to become more farsighted, more illumined. Increasingly, this journey includes visits to non-Western images of women's spiritual quests. MULTICULTURAL IMAGES Western women, relatively advantaged in many aspects of the life cycle, are often uncom- fortable when they realize that non-Western cultures have more continuous spiritual traditions with regard to goddess imagery. It is a paradox that the material and the esoteric spheres of life are so frequently separated geographically and culturally as well as experientially. While Western women often have more material advantages, they are bereft of traditions that honor women's spirituality. One new program that helps bridge these distances is Rise Up and Call Her Name.24 This 13-week curriculum, edited by Califor- nian Elizabeth Fisher, is an encouragement to "explore global earth-based spiritualities" 20 Marcia J.

The program took years to develop, partially because of an attempt to be inclusive with respect to cultural differences, partially because the pilot generated extensive critiques, and partially because of difficulties in obtaining reputable sources. As one who piloted an earlier version, I was pleased to receive the video accompa- nying the final package; however, I supplement courses with materials more relevant to the Canadian context, often inviting representatives of a culture to co-lead sessions. The video, exquisite because of the visual reinforcements, also is enhanced by original chants composed by Nancy Vedder-Shults. Women's traditions of storytelling through quilting, dance, song, and artwork in pottery and clothing are so much more rich than is our written tradition, which is a much more recent development. Therefore, the video format often captures the diversities more eloquently. Rise Up and Call Her Name evolved from a pioneering program, Cakes for the Queen of Heaven, created by the Reverend Shirley Ranck. After millions of women, and men, had participated in the course in which pre-Christian Western Goddess traditions are explored, the demand for a similar program about non-Western traditions resulted in the second package. In addition to the video, the Rise Up and Call Her Name kit contains guidelines for discussing culturally sensitive issues, suggestions for rituals, reference lists, and other resource materials. Now in its second printing, the program is used in a variety of courses in many educational institutions. Thus, the Goddess has become an image for innumerable women searching for a more meaningful existence. THE JOURNEY Scholars in religion have been as active as in any other discipline in discussing women's interests, and their contributions help readers to make multicultural links, to raise the profile of women within Christianity, and to think about the proposed alternatives. When these discussions include the Goddess, the lack of "feminine symbolism of the divine" in Christianity becomes the immediate question to address, not the quest for a relevant image.25 Discovery of appropriate imagery seems to come from the lived experiences of contemporary women and their interpreters, leaders who often have been energized by reconstructing past cultures, excited by constructing fantasy worlds, or mobilized by re- flective insights. Integrating these strongly experienced subjective worlds with the objecti- fied world of reason, of disciplined mental imagination, is not easy. Yet, from these disparate sources some themes emerge. Women's spiritual domain as it is being envisioned today, no matter how hazy the image, is Goddess-centered. Five characteristics or components of the Goddess image are listed but they are interrelated, not ranked, not separated, and not complete. She is being reborn. Through our experience and reflections, through our thoughts and creativity, through our feelings and sharings, she is immanent. That is, she is within us, and we are learning to recognize her and express her presence. In our struggles to become more fully human, to identify with what is female, to honor ourselves, we are birthing her. It is not easy labor, but it is an irreversible process. Like all births, it is part glory, part fear, and part mystery. 25 Among the many contributors to this discussion are Dawne McCance, "Understandings of the 'Goddess' in Contemporary Feminist Scholarship," in Goddess in Religions and Modern Debate, ed.

As constant in change as the rotating of seasons, the phases of the moon, the growth from infancy to maturation, and as individual as each in its time, she is ever present, but always differing. She is maiden, midlife, and crone. "Midlife" is the least defined because of the dominance of the mother image, the disparagement of the profes- sional image as represented by the midwife, and the struggle of so many contemporary women to integrate a multifacted existence without many positive role models. More than mother, the Goddess is nature and nurture. As with all cycles, she is not to be taken for granted, because cycles denote various types of change, but it is the consistency of change itself, from one phase of a cycle to another, that is permanent. One then plans for change, proactively, rather than reacting to the shifts as they occur. She is of this seasonal-influenced planet Earth, immanent in our lives. She is evoked in flowing waterfalls, mighty trees, hard seeds, warbling birds, spontaneous smiles, offertory dances, and shared insights. The wisdom seemingly developed from imaging the Goddess fosters a sense of interconnectedness, an awareness of a role played within the web of life. If the Garden of Eden is the planet herself, our enduring garden in space, then perhaps it is not too fantastical to image our species as the stewards. Among our species, women might act as a life-sustaining "critical mass," not as nuclear-induced destroyers. Surely, such an image is worth a conversion from current societal priorities that have created such ecological imbalances in so many parts of the globe. She is spiritual, but not religious. During this early phase of reclaiming symbols, imagery, and meaning that represent women's lives and values, groups meet out-of-doors, at kitchen tables, and in community halls, but rarely in churches or at lectures. That which is being nurtured is not yet ready to be institutionalized, but the sense of women as spiritual beings is global. On every continent women are meeting to celebrate being women, to share stories, to honor our aesthetics, to witness our lives. As we do so we move beyond a generic identification with the blue planet or the Earth; we begin to make a more positive identification with our gender. We recognize our spark of the divine as female. She is shared, a collective regeneration of personal power. The Goddess may be an individualized metaphor, enhanced by quiet moments of meditation, but the stories, the energy, and the momentum are a collective offering to life. She is a means by which the individual woman may come in from the margins of society and help to reconstruct its decaying center. She is the inspiration by which groups of women will change the world. She is woman power. These five characteristics sketch a woman-centered spirituality that still is difficult to image clearly. As if in a dream or a mist, the presence of the Goddess is sensed, but only occasionally, and briefly, do we perceive her clearly. As individuals and as women, our journey has just begun. It may take us to the depths of our souls, thus helping us to appreciate the heights. It may lead us into dark shadows, from whence we turn toward the light. It will undoubtedly expand our experience of living, thereby enhancing the quality of life. It will result in diverse and more creative achievements. We are coming full circle. CONCLUSION This interdisciplinary overview has been inspired by excellent videos which are enriching the dialogue about women-centered spirituality. The discussion is an attempt to clarify the need and desire for women to image themselves within a female paradigm as spiritual beings. Framed by the context of late twentieth-century Western demographics and recent scholarship about women's history, questions raised by physical and social scientists about intellectual connections between visualizing, achievement, and creativity are also summa- Comparative Education Review 203</page><page sequence="11">MEDIA REVIEWS rized. Leadership provided by artists working with various media also helps image the Goddess, a metaphor for the aesthetic and creative values which enrich lives. Visual media also help reduce cross-cultural boundaries; thus, non-Western women's spiritual traditions may be more easily accessed. Glimpses of the "Goddess" suggest five characteristics that women, and their male supporters, from diverse faiths, cultures, and backgrounds might honor. These changes have profound implications for educators, who cannot remain gender- blind if they are to carry out their moral obligation to facilitate the development of young minds and to renew society by inducting these youth into modes of thinking that help them face the challenges of the next century. Visionaries are needed. These children must not learn to live in intellectual flatlands based on left-right dichotomies. To survive, they need to acquire a global perspective and insights derived from "the Goddess" that empha- size life-affirming interconnections between women and men as well as with other species. One universal human need appears to be a desire to know ourselves better. Women have been caught up in survival, in a struggle to meet the bottom 50 percent of achieve- ment. Developing the higher levels, the top 50 percent, is a different sort of challenge. To maximize our abilities we need to image ourselves as having "a spark of the divine," as resonating with life. As we do so, we develop creative talents, the discipline to achieve, and we will generate wonderful evidence of our insights. These offerings will enrich the world as well as our own lives. One challenge, however, will be the extent to which educators facilitate these possibilities. Thus, it is wise, perhaps, to be reminded that "there's gonna be women (and men) jump up and start tryin' to make a religion out of it and tryin' to sound like experts and tryin' to feel big and look clever in front of other women (and men). And they'll get tired after a while, and give up, but the truth will still be there for the ones who keep lookin' for it."26</page></plain_text>
