<plain_text><page sequence="1">CYRIL BAILEY, PHASES IN THE RELIGION OF ANCIENT ROME. (Sather Classical Lectures, vol. x). Oxford University Press: London; Humphrey Milford, 1932. Pp. 340 + ix. 15s. The occasion of the Sather Classical Lectures at the University of California has given Mr. Bailey the opportunity of developing his own conception of Roman religion in its progress from birth to decay: the present publication gives us the privilege of listening in to his discourses. The learning that lies behind the composition of this book is judiciously veiled-only appearing occasionally in the text and being reserved in the main for an Appendix of notes; but the pleasant and easy style should not lead us to forget that what Mr. Bailey offers us is the fruit of long and profound studies and research. Novelty, in the sense of new facts, is hardly to be expected in so well-tilled -a field, but novelty in the sense of fresh appreciation and observation is refreshingly present throughout. Mr. Bailey is in the main a faithful member of the school of Warde-Fowler, with strong affinities for the school of Wissowa in Germany. His work has the typical merits and demerits of his school. Roman religion is presented, shorn of much muddle and misconception, first in a primitive form-the religion of house and fields of the early farmer-then growing under Greek and Etruscan influence into the form in which we know it in the late Republic-finally passing under the Empire through partial restorations and Oriental influences to its inevitable decline. The method is timple and consistent, the application admirable in its sureness and dexterity. And yet we are not always quite happy. We have no right to expect that the attempt to discover the religion of a pre- historic Rome will be easy, even if it be possible. Yet it is attempted here with considerable confidence, and decisions are sometimes asked for-for example on Janus, as nothing but the spirit of the door-on evidence which seems to many either weak, ,or even adverse. Again, a Roman worship of the dead is positively denied. Yet the ancient evidence seems to prove nothing less, and constant reiteration that the Lares are spirits of the fields and farm, and never anything more, leaves untouched much good e-vidence that either goes beyond or contradicts that view. Mr. Bailey's final denial of ancestor-worship in Rome is given in such a form that we do not know what he really denies. ' We may restate the view that the dead are indeed recognised in Roman cult and given their due, but are not thought of as divine beings to be placated with offerings and prayed to for prosperity' (p. io5). To others the evidence may suggest that we are far more certain of the main fact of ancestor-worship in Rome than of its exact limitations. Mr. Bailey has no hesitation in rejecting the view, strongly championed by Sir James Frazer, that the Roman deities were thought of in human relationships, such as marriage and parenthood. Here many Roman students will feel sympathy with him and will be ready to believe that it was only Greek influence that made the Roman gods wholly anthropomorphic, even if Greek influence, through Cumae and, perhaps, through Etruria, may have to be admitted as earlier and more pervading than is yet fully realised. Yet, when we come to what really look like developed forms of primitive Roman numina,- Spes, Pax, Pietas and the rest-Mr. Bailey will not recogni e them as such, but describes them as ' pallid figures and more like a group of public virtues, than full-blowni deities ' (P. I37). This failure to appraise the real importance of the Virtues is very general,</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND NOTICES OF RECENT PUBLICATIONS 85 in no sense peculiar to MVIr. Bailey: it is, however, we are convinced, a blind spot in the present view of Roman religion. On pp. I20 ff. the great authority and importance of Apollo at Rome is recorded, and at the same time obscured by comment. Apollo, we are told, at Rome was the Healer and no more: ' he must not exercise his capacities in other spheres ' (p. I2I). Surely the Sybil and her books of fate are always and most intimately connected with the prophetic god of Cumae. Beyond these few controversial points which we have selected for discussion, there is a very wide range of delightful exposition and illuminating interpretation. And, even if a reader may now and again find himself unable to accept Mr. Bailey's own conclusions, he will still have to thank him for a candid presentation and discussion of the facts needed to determine judgment.
