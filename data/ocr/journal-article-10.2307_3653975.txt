<plain_text><page sequence="1">"The Whole Internal World His Own": Locke and Metaphor Reconsidered S. H.

Fourfold Annihilation &amp; at the clangor of the Arrows of Intellect The innumerable Chariots of the Almighty appeard in Heaven And Bacon &amp; Newton &amp; Locke, &amp; Milton &amp; Shakespear &amp; Chaucer' Two features of these encomia to John Locke, composed by James Thomson, Thomas Gray, and William Blake, are immediately striking. Firstly, they are delivered by poets in a tradition customarily seen as a reaction to the intellec- tual climate induced by Locke's Essay, a book which Blake famously claimed to regard with "Contempt and Abhorrence."2 Secondly, the familiar and some- what hackneyed characterizations of Locke as philosopher of common-sense, 'James Thomson, "Summer" (1556-59), The Seasons, ed.

For Gray he is "veri magne Sacerdos," great priest of truth; Thomson places him in a pantheon including Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and Chaucer; and this ranking is ex- plicitly endorsed in Blake's "Milton &amp; Shakspear &amp; Chaucer." Comparable praise of Locke's imaginative power is conspicuously absent from even the most generous tributes of recent commentators.3 Even if Locke's philosophical contribution to a variety of debates is fully acknowledged, the question remains of why his major work, An Essay con- cerning Human Understanding, was held in such high popular esteem-ven- eration is not too strong a word-during the subsequent century. The text itself appears an improbable candidate for such canonization: George Saintsbury ac- cused its prose of being "positively mean in every point of style,"4 and certainly in comparison with the poised and lucid ironies of Berkeley and Hume, it can- not but appear prolix, diffuse, and repetitive. The chief (and frequently only) merit grudgingly accorded to it is of disarming informality. Rosalie Colie's emphasis on the "exploitation of the generic and rhetorical possibilities in the essay form itself" highlights the conscious manipulation of authorial distance through which Locke creates the effect of sprawling inclusiveness and incom- pletion, but at the expense of conceding that "in exchange for the frankness with which the essayist appeared to present his thinking self, he was allowed certain liberties from logical rigour."5 Though the suggestion that a major philo- sophical text seeks to evade "logical rigour" might seem damning enough, there is a still more insidious equation of Locke's "middle-style," his desire "to make, what I have to say, as easie and intelligible to all sort of Readers as I can," with a complicity with the expectations of his audience.6 Other critics, notably John Richetti, have put a more positive gloss on the "simple and fortu- itously concocted circle of friends" to whom the Essay is addressed, but even these accounts have been obliged to stress the representative and consensual nature of Locke's thought.7 This view is perhaps most elegantly expressed by Leslie Stephen: "Locke ruled the thought of his own and the coming period 3 See Jerome J.

He ruled, that is, by obeying."8 William Walker correctly observes that "identifying and interpreting meta- phors of mind" in the Essay are "standard practices of mainstream philosophi- cal commentary from Leibniz to Rorty," but also notes that these analyses are usually concerned with the degree to which Locke's reliance on figuration was at variance with and compromised his epistemological doctrine.9 I would argue that the poetic tributes previously quoted offer a more suggestive and adequate guide to the original impact of his work. In order to substantiate this claim, I shall begin by examining Locke's apparent renunciation of, yet paradoxical dependence upon metaphor; go on to look at the connection of the "Horizon" to the elegiac presentation of memory and the ethic of mental "Labour"; and conclude by analyzing the complex interdependence of candle and sun within the light imagery employed in the Essay. One obstacle to detailed analysis of Locke's rhetoric has been his apparent indifference, and presumed hostility, towards the realm of the aesthetic. Yet the myth of the philistine philosopher, readily endorsed even by his strongest pro- ponents, collapses under even the most cursory of inspections.10 Locke was personally, as one might expect, highly cultured: one-time professor of Greek, a bibliophile whose library included seventy-three works of English literature, including Donne and Milton, and an occasional composer of verses himself, including his own epitaph." He endorsed Sir Richard Blackmore more as an "Enemy to all Philosophick Hypotheses" than as a poet, though this, perhaps, may be regarded as insufficient excuse.12 The dogged Socinian exegesis offered in The Reasonableness of Christianity is specifically concerned with establish- ing a lowest common denominator for Christian belief: Locke's other scrip- tural commentaries reveal an acute hermeneutic mind.'3 8 English Literature and Society in the Eighteenth Century (London, 1904), 47. 9 Locke, Literary Criticism, and Philosophy (Cambridge, 1994), xiii.

In Some Thoughts concern- ing Education, Locke begins with inveighing against the "torment" of Latin composition for ungifted children, but then urges that if a son "have a Poetick Vein, 'tis to me the strangest thing in the World, that the Father should desire, or suffer it to be cherished, or improved. Methinks the Parents should labor to have it stifled, and suppressed, as much as may be." There is a degree of mock- earnestness in this cautionary tale: Locke goes on to give the helpful tip of "reading the excellent Greek and Latin poets" rather than "making bad Verses of his own, in a Language which is not his own."14 The vocational advice that "Parnassus" provides "a pleasant Air, but a barren Soil" must be taken in the context of other comments such as "many a good poetic vein is buried under a trade, and never produces any thing for want of improvement."'5 There is an evident and perhaps not wholly unjustified distaste for the social milieu of the Restoration court: "if he proves a successful Rhymer, and gets once the Repu- tation of a Wit, I desire it may be considered, what Company and Places he is like to spend his Time in, nay, and Estate too." The pursuit of poetry is coupled with "Gaming" and regarded as equally inimical to thrift, industry, and pros- perity, a form of"Defiance to all other Callings, and Business."16 In the Essay the parallel rebuke to the "Poetick Vein" centers on the resis- tance of metaphor to pragmatic or utilitarian concepts of language. The issue is first addressed in the implicitly antithetical status of "Wit" which resides in "the assemblage of Ideas ... thereby to make up pleasant Pictures, and agree- able Visions in the Fancy," and "Judgement," which requires "separating care- fully, one from another, Ideas, wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by Similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for an- other" (II, xi, 2). The latter faculty is therefore a "way of proceeding quite contrary to Metaphor and Allusion," whose "Beauty appears at first sight, and there is required no labour of thought, to examine what Truth or Reason there is in it" (II, xi, 2). The "labour of thought" with which "Beauty" is contrasted is itself vividly metaphorical and may be seen as not merely compatible with but even synonymous with the process of "assemblage."'7 The "entertainment and pleasantry" of Wit is here, however, indulged: though "not perfectly conform- able," it is spared the "affront" of further examination. Later in the Essay, however, 'figurative Speeches" are directly attacked "as an imperfection or abuse"; for "if we would speak of Things as they are, we 14 The Educational Writings of John Locke, ed.

Walker, Locke, Literary Criti- cism, and Philosophy, 115-27, cites many other instances of an "implicit rehabilitation of rhetoric" as a legitimate mode of persuasion in questions of faith and belief. 16 On the potentially radical implications of this ethic of labor, see Richard Ashcraft, Revolutionary Politics and Locke's Two Treatises of Government (Princeton, 1986), 262-68.

The "Order and Clearness" which are exempted from criticism are themselves produced by the "Art of Rhetorick" and may be seen as powerfully integrated into the broader metaphorical structures of the Essay, of temporal construction and aspiration towards a transcendence which is dramatized most powerfully in the unmediated experience of light. Locke cannot abandon rhetoric, only substitute a vigorous colloquialism for an eru- dite scholasticism. The parallel between Lockean and Newtonian paradigms, to use the Kuhnian term, has long been familiar: a distinction must be drawn, however, between their respective cultural disseminations. The "problem-situation" established by Newtonian physics was incomprehensible to all but a handful of mathema- ticians: as Thomson observed, "but a few/ Of the deep-studying race can stretch their Minds/To what he knew."'9 The social assimilation of the Principia relied on the mediation of an elite of hierophants who promoted the authority of Newton's work to support, broadly speaking, latitudinarian, progressivist, and proto-capitalist policies.20 Locke's psychology could not claim such an awe- some power of prediction, though its explanatory convenience and flexibility should not be underestimated. But the familiar style of the Essay required no such intercession. Thomas Reid is typical in his insistence that "perhaps no book of the metaphysical kind ... has been so generally read by those who understand the language."21 This is borne out by its spectacular record of reprinting. Despite initial opposition, the Essay went through four editions within ten years of its publi- cation, whereas the Principia was not even translated into English until 1728. In the peak years, between 1727 and 1760, it went through nine separate edi- tions, in addition to inclusion in four sets of collected works. Daniel Waterland's 18 Somewhat remarkably, Philip Vogt, in his recent essay, "Metaphor in Locke's Essay," JHI, 54 (1993), 1-18, claims to be unable to locate this passage (15n), choosing instead to base his discussion of analogy on a single brief passage (IV, xvi, 12), which is subsequently as- serted to offer an "analysis of metaphor" per se (10). 19 "A Poem Sacred to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton" (133-35), The Castle of Indolence and Other Poems, ed.

For the following century, "Locke's philosophy blends spontaneously with the ordinary language of all educated men."23 Locke gives the first moder discussion of personal identity and in so do- ing creates a complex, exacting, and coherent language of the self. Its funda- mental assumptions about the human mind include the model of receptacle, with the senses as "inlets" to an otherwise insurmountable enclosure; an inter- nalized psychic space, inhabited by constellations of atomic particles; and a presiding consciousness in the alternate guises of eye, candle, and workman. The constitutive role of memory makes imagery of vacancy, acquisition, and storage central: the initial reception of sense-data emphasizes the passivity of perception, but in a secondary movement the "Workmanship of the Under- standing" (III, iii, 12) labors incessantly to reconstruct a world. These are not discrete and isolated images but form a system of prohibitions and imperatives, unified yet internally kinetic, which underlies any subsequent attempt to estab- lish a psychic language working within this terrain of debate. I would stress the generative power of Lockean metaphor, in contrast to recent commentators such as Philip Vogt, who restricts it to a heuristic analogy designed to signify a commitment to a probabilistic epistemology, and to Wil- liam Walker, who argues that the transference of rhetorical categories into em- piricist psychology allows a reverse movement of decomposition into Nietzschean tropology.24 To comprehend this dimension more fully, we need both to grasp the intricacy of the internal mechanisms of the Essay and to unravel its complex permeation of a wide range of subsequent texts. It will be helpful to begin with perhaps the most famous single image in the Essay: 22 Daniel Waterland, Advice to a Young Student. with a Method of Studyfor the First Four Years (London, 1730), 23; Blake, Jerusalem pl.15: 14-16 E 159. 23 Stephen, English Literature and Society, 47. 24 Vogt, "Metaphor in Locke's Essay," 4-6, 14-16; Walker, Locke, Literary Criticism and Philosophy, 18. 246 S. H. Clark</page><page sequence="7">Locke and Metaphor That external and internal Sensation, are the only passages that I can find, of Knowledge, to the Understanding. These alone, as far as I can discover, are the Windows by which light is let into this dark Room. For, methinks, the Understanding is not much unlike a Closet wholly shut from light, with only some little opening left, to let in external visible Resemblances, or Ideas of things without. (II, xi, 17) It is the domesticity of Locke's images of constriction-the "dark Room," the "empty cabinet" and the "closet"-that makes them peculiarly effective. Yet the metaphoric resonance of these apparently mundane comparisons can scarcely be exaggerated. "Five windows light the cavern'd Man," as Blake puts it, and Plato's parable of the cave is certainly as relevant an analogue as the "dark closet" in which Newton performed his optical experiments.5 There is a simi- lar emphasis on servitude and exile: the mind has been sentenced to the inter- minable and claustrophobic toil of reconstructing a world from the partial and unreliable data afforded by ideas. Blake's comment that "Reason once fairer than the light" has now been "fould in Knowledges dark Prison house" finds support in Locke's own earlier writings: "Without the help and assistance of the senses," the mind "can achieve nothing more than a labourer working in darkness behind shuttered windows."26 As the famous definition of the "extent of our Knowledge" that begins the fourth book makes clear, the "windows" are never truly open: Since the Mind, in all its Thoughts and Reasonings, hath no other im- mediate Object, but its own Ideas, which it alone does or can contem- plate, it is evident, that our Knowledge is only conversant about them. (IV, i, 1) Once the premise is established that the "immediate Object" of our "Knowl- edge" is "Ideas," the possibility of any direct perception of the world is re- moved and a new question emerges: what, if anything, lies behind "Ideas"? This line of argument leads into the idealism of Berkeley, in which there are only images, given stability and order by a divine perceiver, with no material substratum behind them, and the skepticism of Hume, where the issue is deemed impossible to resolve. 25 Europe, pl.iii: 1 E60. See Opticks: or, a Treatise on the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light (London, 1704), 2:2, 18. Vogt's dismissal of the analogue as "merely coincidental" ("Metaphor in Locke's Essay," 5) may be contrasted with Reid's comment that "PLATO's subterranean cave, and Mr LOCKE's dark closet, may be applied with ease to all the systems of perception that have been invented": Intellectual Powers, 2:7, 117. 26 "then She bore Pale desire" (60-61) E446; Locke, Essays on the Law of Nature, ed.

Let us chace our imagination to the heavens, or to the utmost limits of the universe; we never really advance a step beyond ourselves, nor can conceive any kind of existence, but those perceptions which have ap- peared in that narrow compass.27 Granted the basic principle, Hume's position is virtually unassailable but not therefore particularly influential: the social currency of such Pyrrhonist anxi- eties has been greatly exaggerated. What fascinated the period was not so much the logical difficulties of the issue of solipsism as the implications of Locke's language of memory, which had now been raised to the primary principle of continuity of self.28 Similarly, it is not the intellectual conundrum of the "veil of ideas" that recurs throughout the writing of the period, but an apprehension at the "narrow compass" of the self, of its ever-tightening boundaries, and of a literally con- tracting psychological space. This preoccupation with what Blake terms the "bound or outward circumference"29 can be seen as stemming from a famous image in the introduction to the Essay: Whereas were the Capacities of our Understandings well considered, the Extent of our Knowledge once discovered, and the Horizon found, which sets the Bounds between the enlightned and dark Parts ofThings, between what is, and what is not comprehensible by us, Men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avow'd Ignorance of the one, and imploy their Thoughts and Discourse, with more Advantage and Satisfaction in the other. (I, i, 7) The blend of skepticism and humility here advocated seems brisk and prag- matic, a substitution of secular ignorance for sacral mystery, a manifesto for activity in the world insofar as it is knowable. The overt intention appears to be to instill a chastened pragmatism: to prevail with the busy mind of Man, to be more cautious in meddling with things exceeding its Comprehension; to stop, when it is at the utmost Extent of its Tether; and to sit down in a quiet Ignorance of 27 "Of the idea of existence, and of external existence," A Treatise of Human Nature, ed.

(I, i, 4) "Quiet Ignorance," however, can offer no more than a pseudo-repose, a spuri- ous stability that is immediately reabsorbed into a potentially infinite regress. "Examination" proves to be a treadmill rather than a "Tether": we must exam- ine our examinings of examinings. There are two underlying imperatives that make a placid acceptance of limitation impossible. The first is theological: "paradise, wherein was tranquil- lity" was lost by the Fall, and we are now subject to a regime of pain.30 "Man" without this goading, "would be a very idle inactive Creature, and pass his time only in a lazy lethargick Dream" (II, vii, 3). Ignorance is culpable but certainty unattainable: the only viable response is to yield up a ceaseless tribute of effort. Superimposed on this and often indistinguishable from it, there is a continuous intensity of aspiration: "Nothing being so beautiful to the Eye, as Truth is to the Mind; nothing so deformed and irreconcilable to the Understanding, as a Lye" (IV, iii, 20). The transcendence, which Locke sought to abolish by rejecting the possibility of pure intellection, reemerges as an ideal outside man's "narrow scantling of capacity" (II, xxi, 59), but nonetheless preserved within the inter- stices of the Essay's rhetoric. The insistence on the "Horizon," the "Extent" of whose "Tether" is determined by the "veil of ideas" and the physical barriers of the senses, has the paradoxical effect of intimating that the "enlightned ... Parts of Things" might lie outside those "Bounds."31 Yet if, as Blake protests, the empiricist reliance on the "five senses" served to "inclose" the "infinite brain into a narrow circle,"32 the strength and nobility of reason are shown at their greatest intensity in this voluntary self-confine- ment. Locke's almost ingenuous disavowal of excessive ambition conceals an edict of colossal power.33 This was appreciated and applauded by the French philosophes: Voltaire writes that "he dares sometimes to affirm, but he dares also to doubt.... Locke considers at last the extent or rather the nothingness of human knowledge"; and Condorcet concurs that "Locke was the first to dare to fix the limits of human intelligence, or rather to determine the nature of the truths which it could know, and the objects which it could grasp."34 30 The Reasonableness of Christianity, Works, VII, 5.

No such locus of ontological per- manence and ethical responsibility exists for Locke, and though not directly attacked, the concept is marginalized into virtual insignificance (II, xxvii, 25). Hence everything humanly individual resides in the "Person": a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self, the same thinking thing in different times and places; which it does only by that consciousness, which is inseparable from thinking, and as it seems to me essential to it. (II, xxvii, 9) The Oxford English Dictionary only records three previous usages of "con- sciousness," two now obsolete, and only one, by Cudworth, even remotely comparable. In the sense of "the totality of the impressions, thoughts, and feel- ings, which make up a person's conscious being," the term is a Lockean coin- age and as such typically resistant to precise definition. It includes three major senses: the experience of present sensations, one's awareness of oneself as hav- ing those sensations, and the ability to repeat past sensations to relate them to the present self. This final sense, as a virtual synonym for memory, locates personal identity in an act of retrospective comparison. There are immediate problems with such a definition, for they do not effect the central point that personal identity is made dependent upon memory, and the continuity of the self becomes necessarily temporal.39 35 The Four Zoas, 24:5 E314; 30:8 E319. 36 The Four Zoas, 30:5 E314. 37 The Four Zoas, 63:24 E343. 38 Discourse on the Method, IV, The Philosophical Works of Descartes, ed.

Clark</page><page sequence="11">Locke and Metaphor The fidelity of ideas to the external world is determined by their degree of clarity, which is in a state of "constant decay" (II, x, 5). The mind can only hope to defer, by efficient techniques of storage, the loss of their "first Fresh- ness," which must be "faded or tarnished by Time" (II, xxix, 2). Hence the crucial importance attached to memory, the "Store-house of our Ideas" (II, x, 2): a mental life is posited whose dominant concern must be to conserve these ephemeral mediations of an antecedent and otherwise unknowable reality. So the employment of memory becomes central to all mental acts, and this enforced reliance precludes any further interrogation of the now sacrosanct faculty. Shaftesbury concludes, "for my own part, I take my being upon trust"; Joseph Butler abruptly breaks off his essay, "Of Personal Identity," when fac- ing "a Question concerning the Truth of Perception by Memory," which means "Here then we can go no farther"; and Reid devotes an entire chapter to vener- ating this "original faculty given us by the Author of our being, of which we can give no account, but that we are so made."40 Yet Locke's account of reten- tion also supports antithetical emphases: So necessary and excellent a Faculty is the Memory of Man, that all other Abilities of the Mind borrow from hence their Beauty and Per- fection; for the other Capacities of the Soul are almost useless without this.... Without Memory the Soul of Man would be but a poor destitute naked Being, with an everlasting Blank spread over it, except the fleet- ing Ideas of the present Moment. Isaac Watts here celebrates the opportunities opened by Locke wiping the slate clean, so to speak, and providing the basis for a doctrine of human per- fectibility.41 The tabula rasa makes it possible to envisage an open-ended ex- pansion of the self, with no obstacle to endless vistas of both psychic and social progress. Lord Chesterfield could confidently pronounce that "a drayman is probably born with as good organs as Milton, Locke, or Newton; but, by cul- ture, they are much more above him than he is above his horse"; and in his painstaking efforts to preserve this differential, he brings up his illegitimate son strictly according to "the famous Mr. Locke's book upon Education."

Although a strong proponent of environmental determin- ism-"Nine Parts of Ten are what they are ... by their Education"43-his view is both more complex and more equivocal. Even in the Essay there are delicate and scrupulous observations on the child coming to consciousness (1, ii, 25) and praise for its intelligence as "least corrupted by Custom, or borrowed Opin- ions" (1, ii, 27). In Some Thoughts concerning Education this deference can assume strong Platonic overtones: They are Travellers newly arrived in a strange Country, of which they know nothing: We should therefore make Conscience not to mislead them.... The native and untaught Suggestions of inquisitive Children, do often offer things, that may set a considering Man's Thoughts on work.44 The unformedness of the child is an active reproach to what Blake calls the "errors of acquired folly."45 But opposed to this there remain elements of the Calvinist idea of the unbroken "Will": children "with Bawling and Peevishness contend for Mastery" and therefore "should be used to submit their Desires, and go without their Longings, even from their very Cradles."4 The autono- mous, even demonic, will of the child thrives on idleness: the slightest hint of the "Sauntring Humour" must be immediately extirpated through a curative regime of "constant bodily Labour."47 And it is this preoccupation which be- comes powerfully integrated with Locke's epistemology. The spectacle of Chesterfield, the aristocratic sensualist, urging such an ascetic discipline upon his son appears almost ludicrously incongruous: I hope you employ your whole time, which few people do; and that you put every moment to profit of some kind or other.... [W]hat I can- not forgive, in any body, is sauntering, and doing nothing at all, with a thing so precious as time, and so irrecoverable when lost.48 42 Letters by the Late Right Honourable Philip Dormer Stanhope Earl of Chesterfield written to his Son Philip Stanhope Esq.

Public granaries are filled in plentiful years; not that it is known that the next, or the second, or the third year will prove a scarce one; but because it is known, that, sooner or later, such a year will come, in which the grain will be wanted.49 The logic of the image must be pursued. There can be no further harvest, merely starvation unto extinction. The ultimately futile nature of the struggle is recognized in the somber elegiac power of Locke's famous account of memory: Thus the Ideas, as well as Children, of our Youth, often die before us: And our Minds represent to us those Tombs, to which we are approach- ing; where though the Brass and Marble remain, yet the Inscriptions are effaced by time, and the Imagery moulders away. The Pictures drawn in our Minds, are laid in fading Colours; and if not sometimes re- freshed, vanish and disappear. (II, x, 5) The refreshment itself, however, must "vanish and disappear" in its turn. The image of the psyche as a tabula rasa can be traced at least as far back as Aristotle's De Anima, and as Philip Vogt points out, direct usages of the term are ex- tremely infrequent in the Essay.50 Locke's originality, however, lies in his con- necting it with the continual temporal erosion of consciousness itself: "Time, I daily find, blots out apace the little Stock of my Mind."5' The self does not merely grow from voidness: it must also return to the "everlasting Blank." In forgetting things, one forgets oneself: the eighteenth-century sense of mutabil- ity is inexorably self-directed. This does not, however, entail simple acquiescence as is suggested by an examination of Locke's ethic of mental labor. A second stage of consciousness is also implied in which the mind labors to reconstruct a world. As Locke himself acknowledges, his psychological language is composed of"Words taken from the Operations of sensible Things, and applied to certain Modes ofThink- ing" (III, i, 5).52 Even the claim that these may be empirically verified, "when 49 Chesterfield, Letters, LXXX, I, 195. 5s See The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation, ed.

This is what it sees: Sensation ... is, as it were, the actual entrance of any Idea into the Understanding by the Senses. The same Idea, when it again recurs without the operation of the like Object on the external Sensory, is Remembrance: If it be sought after by the mind, and with pain and endeavour found, and brought again in view, 'tis Recollection: if it be held there long under attentive Consideration, 'tis Contemplation: When Ideas float in our mind, without any reflection or regard of the Under- standing, it is ... Reverie.... When the Ideas that offer themselves ... are taken notice of, and, as it were, registred in the Memory, it isAttention: When the mind with great earnestness, and of choice, fixes its view on any Idea, considers it on all sides, and will not be called off by the ordinary sollicitation of otherIdeas, it is that we call Intention, orStudy. (II, xix, 1) Ideas themselves acquire some degree of volition ("offer themselves," "solli- citation"), with the capacity to "float" alluringly, in contrast to the "Bottom- ing" and "grounding" performed by reason. Many of Locke's most acute psychological observations occur through simi- lar vivid literalisms, local accidents in the prose, resistant and evocative. More important, though, is the depiction of thought as "Actions," as a linear process occurring in spatial dimensions ("Ideas" have "sides"), almost invariably de- picted by verbs of physical exertion and synonymous with "pain and endeav- our." Locke's very syntax places all thought in bondage to "labour" and "suc- cession," insists that the self can only be constituted through activity in time. The limits within which it operates are fixed by theological sanctions that re- serve the prerogative of creation and destruction for the Deity: The Dominion of Man, in this little World of his own Understanding, being muchwhat the same, as it is in the great World of visible things; wherein his Power, however managed by Art and Skill, reaches no farther, than to compound and divide the Materials, that are made to his Hand; but can do nothing towards the making the least Particle of new Matter, or destroying one Atome of what is already in Being. (II, ii, 2) Locke, Literary Criticism, and Philosophy, 116, argues that "ideas of reflection" are "formed through borrowing and transference in a manner akin to metaphor." 254 S. H. Clark</page><page sequence="15">Locke and Metaphor The analogy between the composition of ideas and that of physical particles has prompted much unease among Locke's philosophical apologists: Michael Ayers for example, dubs it "in effect a sort of conceit, doing no philosophical work."53 This analytic reduction to "Materials," however, is the necessary pre- liminary for the "Workmanship of the Understanding" (III, iii, 12) to construct a world, or, as Blake scoffingly but accurately puts it, to "build a Universe with Farthing Balls."54 Locke's psychological vocabulary is composed almost exclusively of terms of "Art and Skill": "assemble" "bring together," "combine," "compare," "en- large," "frame," "form," "fashion," "rank," "repeat," "separate," "set by," and "unite."55 Its homogeneity consolidates into a narrow but extremely vigorous ideal of what thought can achieve. As Locke writes to Molyneux: I am always for the builders who bring some addition to our knowl- edge, or, at least, some new thing to our thoughts. The finders of faults, the confuters and pullers-down, do but only erect a barren and useless triumph upon human ignorance, but advance us nothing in the acquisi- tion of truth. Of all the mottos I ever met with, this, writ over a water- work at Cleve, best pleased me. Natura omnes fecit judices paucos artifices56 The stress is always on the builders not the buildings, the making not the monu- ment (even "pullers-down ... erect"). Thought is an internal battle to subdue and control, and then engage in a perpetual process of reconstruction. Blake gives a splendidly economical formulation of this struggle in one of the open- ing plates of Milton: "Within labouring, beholding Without: from Particulars to Generals/ Subduing his Spectre, they Builded the Looms of Generation/ They Builded Great Golgonooza Times on Times Ages on Ages."57 This cap- tures Locke's sharp division between the mind "Within" and the sensory world "Without," with "beholding" providing the raw material of ideas. Even though Los, the Spirit of Prophecy, is here said to be "Subduing his Spectre," the 53 John Locke, I, 18. 54 "Public Address," E579. See R. S.

He gave it to the use of the Industrious and Rational, (and Labour was to be his Title to it;)....59 The contractarian anthropology of the Second Treatise is never brought into precise relation with a Christian anthropology of the Fall: there are vague refer- ences to a Classical "Golden Age," but also complaints about the "negligent, and unforeseeing Innocence of the First Ages."60 There is no concept of an unfallen state, but instead of an unfallen labor. One cannot but be wary before trespassing on the bitter and protracted debate on Locke's theory of property. Nevertheless I would suggest that one set of difficulties arise from his reluc- tance to separate the activity of labor from its product: The Labour of his Body, and the Work of his Hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the State that Nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his Labour with, andjoyned to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his Property.61 The logic of Locke's argument about the benefits received from contracting into civil society demands that the intrusion of money into the state of Nature should be seen as a necessary and progressive step, which allows commodities, exchange, and society itself to come into being. Yet the severance involved is constantly stressed: we are told that it has no "real Use" except preventing waste, and only a "Phantastical imaginary value"; and that "amor sceleratus habendi, evil Concupiscence" has now "corrupted Men's minds."62 Authentic labor involves being "mixed ... with" and "joyned to" what has been made: this 58 Elsewhere in Blake (Jerusalem, pl.77 E232), this imagery takes on an unequivocally exhortatory function: "to Labour in Knowledge. is to Build up Jerusalem: and to Despise Knowledge, is to Despise Jerusalem &amp; her Builders." 59 Two Treatises of Government, ed.

(IV, xiv, 2) Two points need to be stressed here: first, despite the pietistic "we," the "way" is fiercely and consistently contrasted with the "common road": second, 63 See E. J. Hundert, "The Making of Homo Faber: John Locke between Ideology and History," JHI, 33 (1972), 3-22 4 John Dunn's phrases, from his discussion of the Puritan concept of the calling in The Political Thought of John Locke: An Historical Account of the Argument of the Two Treatises of Government (Cambridge, 1969), 220 65 Two Treatises, 2:61, 326. 66 Conduct, III, 248. 67 Conduct, III, 201. 68 "Metaphor in Locke's Essay," 16-18.

"Twilight" is the antithesis of and not the prelude to a "State of greater Perfec- tion." We are born ignorant of every thing.... God has made the intellectual world harmonious and beautiful without us; but it will never come into our heads all at once; we must bring it home piece-meal, and there set it up by our own industry, or else we shall have nothing but darkness and a chaos within, whatever order and light there be in things without us.69 An external world of radiant intelligibility must be filtered and reduced before it becomes compatible with human understanding. "Order and light" are situ- ated'"without us": our present experience is that of"darkness and a chaos within," which may be mitigated though not wholly overcome by the "industry" which reassembles the "piece-meal" data of ideas. At times, quest and struggle be- come their own justification, subsuming or even directly opposed to, the con- cept of truth as certainty, product: So much as we our selves consider and comprehend of Truth and Rea- son, so much we possess of real and true Knowledge. The floating of other Men's Opinions in our brains makes us not one jot the more knowing, though they happen to be true. What in them was Science, is in us but Opiniatrety. (I, iv, 23) Or, more succinctly, "Whatever is commonly received, has the mark of the beast on it."70 In Bacon the various categories of"idols"-of the tribe, the cave, the mar- ket-place, and the theater-all spring from the original corruption of the human mind, its ineradicable gravitation towards error.7' Locke absorbs some of this terminology directly-"Men worship the Idols that have been set up in their Minds" (I, iii, 26)-but in the crucible of his tense and restless intellect, the cultural manifesto becomes an issue of personal salvation.72 Bacon, with a kind of self-preening hindsight, presents himself as an object for admiring emula- 69 Conduct, III, 249. 70 Conduct, III, 227. 71 See in particular, Francis Bacon, Novum Organum, Propositions xxxviii-xliv, James Spedding et al.

Every one declares against blindness, and yet who almost is not fond of that which dims his sight, and keeps the clear light out of his mind, which should lead him into truth and knowledge?74 The beckoning absolute of the "clear light" is typical of the residual (though unconsummated) transcendence sublimated in Locke's use of the trope. To sub- stantiate this claim, I now wish to analyze the opposition between the internal light of the candle and the external radiance of the sun. In Bacon the lumen siccum intellectus is the means by which the mind can cleanse itself in order to know the ideas in the divine mind, which are the laws of nature. This is roughly equivalent to Locke's image of the "Candle of the Lord," the most famous instance of which occurs in the introduction to the Essay: It will be no excuse to an idle and untoward Servant, who would not attend his Business by Candle-light, to plead that he had not broad Sun-shine. The Candle, that is set up in us, shines bright enough for all our Purposes. (I, i, 5) The ultimate source of the image is Proverbs 20:27, The Spirit of a Man is the Candle of the Lord. This is almost certainly mediated through the sermons of Whichcote, where it is heavily Platonized as the first "Emanation" of Divine Truth that "flows from God, in the first Instant and Moment of God's Creation; and then it is the Light of that Candle which God set up in Man, to light him."75 Locke incorporates the image with typically ingenuous literalism: ideas follow each other, "not much unlike the Images in the inside of a Lanthorn, 73 Writing to his disciple, Samuel Bold, Locke describes the preparations for receiving thought almost in terms of a mystical sacrament.

This "spark of the divine nature" is identified with the "light of reason," which, if followed, could enable pagans to escape damnation: He that made use of the candle of the Lord, so far as to find what was his duty, could not miss to find also the way to reconciliation and for- giveness, when he failed of his duty: though, if he used not his reason this way, if he put out or neglected this light, he might, perhaps, see neither.76 The candle, by what Culverwel describes as a "weak participation in some- thing that is more bright and glorious,"77 allows us to experience "here and there, a little of this clear Light, some Sparks of bright Knowledge" (IV, xvii, 15). The claims of the individual conscience to dignity and autonomy rest solely "in following the Dictates of that Light God has given him."78 He that does otherwise, transgresses against his own Light, and mis- uses those Faculties, which were given him to no other end, but to search and follow the clearer Evidence, and greater Probability. (IV, xvii, 24) Although the OED restricts the seventeeth-century usage of "inner-light" to Quakerism (7b), it is interesting to find John Sergeant, in 1697, claiming Locke "had introduced a kind of Fanaticism into Philosophy; built, in the main or in great part, on a pretended Inward Light by means of those Imaginary and Visionary Ideas."79 The image recurs prominently in Deist writings,80 and even in Locke this self-authenticating principle can acquire directly political over- tones: The Subject part of Mankind, in most Places, might ... with Aegyptian Bondage, expect Aegyptian Darkness, were not the Candle of the Lord set by himself in Men's minds, which it is impossible for the Breath or Power of Man wholly to extinguish.

Clark</page><page sequence="21">Locke and Metaphor A candle is, nevertheless, only a candle, and even the most obedient of servants might wonder why they had been condemned to an eternal nocturnal exist- ence.81 In a long line of Protestant homily, it signifies the insignificance of man in relation to the sun of divinity: "Though the candle of Reason excell in light the Glow-worms of sense, Yet it is but a candle not the sun it self; it makes no day, only shines in the darknesses of the night."82 Culverwell eloquently ex- presses the same awareness, yet refuses to regard this limitation as absolute. The sensuous prospect of reunion is celebrated rather than withheld: 'Tis but a brief and compendious flame, shut up, and imprison'd in a narrow compasse. How farre distant is it from the beauty of a Starre? How farre from the brightnesse of a Sun?... God never intended that a creature should rest satisfied with its own candle-light, but that it should run to the fountain of light, and sunne it self in the presence of its God.83 For Locke, reason, denied any such communion, must instead make do with the somewhat fustian substitute of"truest and best notions."Yet it is through the trope of sunshine that God is presented with greatest immediacy and con- viction: the listlessness of the occasional anthropomorphism: that we finding imperfection, dissatisfaction, and want of complete happiness, in all the Enjoyments which the Creatures can afford us, might be led to seek it in the enjoyment of him, with whom there is fullness ofjoy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures for ever more. (II, vii, 5) This demands to be compared with the surge and intoxication of the account of self-evident knowledge: This part of Knowledge is irresistible, and like the bright Sun-shine, forces it self immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever the Mind turns its view that way; and leaves no room for Hesitation, Doubt or Examination, but the Mind is presently filled with the clear Light of it.

Locke's attempts to annex some comparable status for the "tedious and not always successful Labour of strict Reasoning" (IV, xix, 5) cannot help but seem, despite their chastened humility, meager and almost incongruous in compari- son: When we find out an Idea, by whose Intervention we discover the Connexion of two others, this is a Revelation from God to us, by the Voice of Reason. For we then come to know a Truth that we did not know before. When God declares any Truth to us, that is a Revelation to us by the Voice of his Spirit, and we are advanced in our Knowledge. (IV, vii, 11) The experience remains stubbornly irreconcilable with that of"intuition": "For in this, the Mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the Truth, as the Eye doth light, only by being directed toward it" (IV, ii, 1). This antithesis betwen truth as "pains of proving or examining" and the flooding in of "bright Sun-shine" is arguably the crux of the whole Essay; a continual striving towards that which can be granted but never achieved, a possibility excluded by the epistemology, but whose continued presence within the rheto- ric never ceases to goad Locke to new intensities of effort. Kant rebukes Locke for allowing the pure concepts of understanding to be derived from experience and thereby having "opened a wide door to enthusi- asm-for if reason once be allowed such rights, it will no longer allow itself to be kept within bounds by vaguely defined recommendations of moderation."84 When Locke specifically addresses himself to this problem, a comparable ca- pitulation takes place within his rhetoric: the iconography of light refuses to be restrained by the prolixity of propositional truth. The style of his chapter "Of Enthusiasm" should be compared to the unruffled composure of Shaftesbury's "A Letter concerning Enthusiasm," where the subject-matter is spoken about rather than addressed, consistently belittled, never brought into relation to its author's own Platonic rhapsodizing.85 The verbal felicities, the ostentatious ease and tepid gracefulness, are assumed to confer a social and moral authority that can safely confine and diagnose enthusiasm as a sociological phenomenon. In contrast Locke displays a consistent distrust of common sense as social corrective, and an overt hostility to received authority. The enthusiasts are ap- 84 Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, ed. Norman Kemp Smith, (London, 19332), 128. 85 Shaftesbury, Characteristics, I, 5-39 262 S. H. Clark</page><page sequence="23">Locke and Metaphor pealed to on terms of equality, accorded an urgent respect that at times verges on desperation: at one stage Locke is even reduced to "beseeching."86 The cru- cial admission comes in the fifth section: "GOD I own cannot be denied to enlighten the Understanding by a Ray darted into the Mind immediately from the Fountain of Light" (IV, xix, 5). This undermines Locke's position in two ways. Firstly it draws on the Platonist theory of emanation extremely directly: "But the publishing and manifestation of this Law ... does flow from that heav- enly beame which God has darted into the soul of man, from the Candle of the Lord, which God has lighted up for the discovery of his owne Lawes."87 In so doing, Locke both allows enthusiasm to occupy the position that Culverwel here allots to the "higher reason," and concedes that its origin differs only in degree and is thus no more inherently improbable. Secondly, "immediately" is here used in its older sense of "unmediatedly," and so makes the "Ray" as unassailable a form of knowledge as simple ideas.88 Once the premise is granted that our own unmediated experience cannot be challenged, and Locke's whole epistemology rests on this principle, of inner autonomy, that "when a Man says he sees or he feels, no Body can deny it him, that he does so" (IV, xix, 10), the authenticity of the "internal Light" cannot be legitimately challenged. The presence of such overtly disparaging phrases as "groundless Opinion," and "the Conceits of a warmed or over-weening Brain" cannot stifle the excited appreciation of, and covert identification with, the state of enthusiasm displayed in the central sections of the essay (6-8). It is acknowledged to act "more pow- erfully" than either reason or revelation: the moralistic caveats of"check" and "restraint" are swept aside by a language of physical release, even ecstasy: And the whole Man is sure to act more vigorously, where the whole Man is carried by a natural Motion. For strong conceit like a new Prin- ciple carries all easily with it, when got above common Sense, and freed from all restraint of Reason, and check of Reflection, it is height- ened into a Divine Authority, in concurrence with our own Temper and Inclination. (IV, xix, 7) "Strong conceit" is addressed as a young god, "(be)got above common Sense," "freed," asserting its full stature: it is "our own Temper and Inclination," not that of a hypothetical enthusiast, that dissolves, flows in "concurrence" with 86 "If they say by the Light it brings with it. which shines bright in their Minds, and they cannot resist, I beseech them to ..." (4: 19:11). 87 Culverwel, Light of Nature, 69. Locke specifically denies a similar claim by the Cam- bridge Platonist, John Smith, because of the "savour of Enthusiasme" (Correspondence, 687, II, 488). 88 The OED defines it as "without intermediary, intervening agency or medium," and cites Locke on simple ideas as an example: "We immediately by our Senses perceive in Fire its Heat and Colour." 263</page><page sequence="24">"impulses," "Inclination," and "natural Motion," and is "heightened into a Di- vine Authority." Shaftesbury's appeals for a generous and inclusive variety of perspectives to subject all opinions to the "test of ridicule" is not so permissive as to allow the enthusiasts the right of reply.89 Locke, however, launches into a pseudo- polemic on their behalf, the satirical intention of which is rapidly abandoned, as the light imagery that permeates the Essay crystallizes into a celebration of the "Ease and Glory it is to be inspired and be above the common and natural ways of Knowledge" (IV, xix, 8): Reason is lost upon them, they are above it: they see the Light infused into their Understandings, and cannot be mistaken; 'tis clear and vis- ible there; like the Light of bright Sunshine, shews it self, and needs no other Proof, but its own Evidence: they feel the Hand of GOD moving them within, and the impulses of the Spirit, and cannot be mistaken in what they feel. (IV, xix, 8) "Reason is lost upon them," not only because wasted but also because defeated, stymied: they are "above it" not only in their arrogance, but also in their state of transcendence. The tone loses its peevishness: the striking localization of"there" seems to open up internal vistas of translucence inside the recipient. Locke's rhetorical question, "Would he not be ridiculous who should require to have it proved to him, that the Light shines, and that he sees it?" (IV, xix, 8), becomes curiously self-directed, and provokes a reply that, despite the belated disavowal of"this is the way of talking of these Men" (IX, xix, 9), it is impossible to read ironically: It is its own Proof, and can have no other. When the Spirit brings Light into our Minds, it dispels Darkness. We see it, as we do that of the Sun at Noon, and need not the twilight of Reason to shew it us. This Light from Heaven is strong, clear, and pure, carries its own Demonstration with it, and we may as rationally take a Glow-worme to assist us to discover the Sun, as to examine the celestial Ray by our dim Candle, Reason. (IV, xix, 8) The switch of governing pronoun from "they" to "we" is nominally a shift into the free indirect speech of the enthusiasts: this, however, surely becomes an assertion of the spiritual potential of redeemed man. The truculent sarcasm withers before the power of the sun trope: instead the contrast between the 89 Characteristics, I, 10. 264 S. H. Clark</page><page sequence="25">Locke and Metaphor "Light from Heaven ... strong, clear, and pure" and the fallen "twilight of Rea- son" produces a blend of pathos, envy, and resignation.9 Thus it becomes possible to see Locke's prose not as a platitudinous cor- roboration but containing its own internal drama: a sublimated Calvinism in which fall and separation demand unending and self-authenticating toil, spurred on by a vision of radiance forever denied. The awe which the Essay inspired must be understood in terms of the heroic astringency of his intellectual enter- prise: Since it is the Understanding, that sets Man above the rest of sensible Beings, and gives him all the Advantage and Dominion, which he has over them; it is certainly a Subject, even for its Nobleness, worth our Labour to enquire into. (I, i, 1) The "Nobleness" of the "Subject" both elicits and becomes synonymous with the "Labour" with which it is pursued, in a continuous dramatization of the questing and irredeemably single intellect in pursuit of the "Original, Certainty, and Extent of humane Knowledge" (I, i, 2). And in the course of this search, I would suggest, it is the productive power of Lockean metaphor, both in its internal frictions and subsequent intertextual transformations, that enables the philosopher, in Thomson's words, to make "the whole internal world his own."
