Printed in Malaysia The 'Pastrone System': Ita l Film from the origins to World War I Silvio Alovisio Before Itala: Carlo Rossi &amp; Co. _W _ _hile the first Italian film was released in 1905, it was only around 1906 and 1 907 that the national industry began to take off. Along with new investments, production companies, distribution exchanges, and permanent movie theatres, a growing popular audience came into view.1 In a time of radical transformations and modern opportunities, the city of Turin offered several con- ditions (economic, technological and cultural) favourable to the development of a national film industry.2 Itala Film was created in Turin in 1908, from the remnants of another Turin film company, Carlo Rossi &amp; Co, which had closed down shortly be- fore.3 Formally created by Carlo Rossi and Guglielmo Remmert in 1907, Carlo Rossi &amp; Co. from the start had hired technicians from Pathe, a practice first adopted by Cines and later by Itala.4 In the summer of 1907, Rossi hired a young and inexperienced twenty-five-year-old accountant, Giovanni Pastrone. At Carlo Rossi &amp; Co. Pastrone had an impressive career; within a few months, he was made chief executive. In one year of activity, Rossi had given his com- pany an international dimension, but he was not a proficient administrator. He liquidated the com- pany in February 1908, in disagreement with the internal restructuring plans that Remmert had de- signed with his father-in-law, engineer Carlo Scia- mengo.5 Remmert and Sciamengo, as well as Pastrone, wanted to rebuild the firm, even if that meant creating a new one. A few months later, possibly in May 1 908, a new company, called Itala Film, began production.6 Sciamengo was the chief executive and Pastrone the artistic director. The links with Rossi &amp; Co. were several: the offices were the same; Itala's first films were simply reissues of Rossi's, with the addition of a new logo and differ- ent intertitles; the personnel came from the 'old' company; even the new company's trademark was graphically similar to Rossi's. And, quite impor- tantly, Itala made use of Rossi's unique distribution network. The company had been one of the earliest to penetrate foreign markets.7 In its early stages, Remmert held the owner- ship of Itala. Shortly afterward, however, he left managerial responsibility to Sciamengo, the ma- jority shareholder (although the formal change of property would occur only in 1911). Meanwhile, Pastrone expanded his role from artistic director to include large administrative duties. The 1908/09 crisis and Itala's international expansion Itala emerged in a period of crisis for the film industry, both in Italy and abroad. As often occurs for new businesses, the crisis was connected to the Silvio Alovisio is a Doctoral Candidate in Cin- ema Studies at the University of Turin.

In the early 1910s, although distribution was structured locally, a new marketing system of film renting began to emerge. Meanwhile, the drastic reorganisations of the American film industry were threatening to keep Italian companies out of the highly profitable US market. In this uncertain situation, new companies such as Itala found opportunities for growth and development. Taking full advantage of what Carlo Rossi &amp; Co. had put into place (an experienced administration, international contacts, and even modern equipment) and combining it with solid capital and new managerial skills, Itala survived the emergency with new initiatives on the international scene. When the most powerful European film producers met in Paris in February 1909 to study common solutions to the crisis and to restructure the mar- ket, Itala's Carlo Sciamengo played an important diplomatic role on be- half of the Italian film industry. He fought the new Pathe-inspired rent- ing policy and tried to address the crucial issue of the MPPC's protec- tionist scheme. Domestic markets, especially in Italy, were not enough to support developments of produc- tion; the immense American market was a necessary outlet. In those years, Itala conducted an aggres- sive marketing campaign to gain access to foreign markets. In 1910, through an alliance with Tyler Film Co., it became the greatest export- ing company in the UK. In Russia, Sciamengo established exclusive re- lationships with Hanzonkov, the big- gest domestic distributor, while in France Itala was able to exhibit two to three new films per week. Still, the American market remained the sub- ject of the Turinese company's most ambitious commercial plans.9 In 1909 and 1910, Sciamengo made two business trips to the US. During the first one (ac- companied by Arturo Ambrosio) he refused to ac- cept the conditions dictated by the trust. Thus, Itala did business with a few independent distribution companies: Film Import and Trading Co., New York Motion Picture Co., and Bison - whose films Itala distributed in Italy.10 During the second trip, Sciamengo entered partnership with another inde- pendent firm, the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Co., and ensured two weekly releases. The results of these strategic expansions were remark- able: between 1 908 and 1911 Itala was the most important Italian film exporter in the US. And the success of Pastrone's La caduta di Troia (The Fall of Troy, 1911) appeared to threaten even the Gen- eral Film Company's monopoly. 251</page><page sequence="3">252 To strengthen its position, in 1912 Itala opened a New York branch, Itala Film Co. of America, linked to the distribution network of Film Supply Co. of America. Despite the company's ambitions, however, that year its US exports began to decrease, possibly due to interrelated causes: the company's obstinate and exhausting prefer- ence for feature films and the equally all-consum- ing preparations for Cabiria (1 91 4). Labour division For the standards of contemporary Italian cinema, Giovanni Pastrone set up quite a sophisticated and advanced production system. Museo Nazion- ale del Cinema (Turin) has preserved an astonishing pre-1914 document that details the company's production regulations and policies at a time in which the national film industry still did not clearly distinguish among professional roles and tasks.1 In the production process, the first step was the preparation of the story outline (soggetto). Before finishing it, the writer was to give the company the opportunity to evaluate the inherent production costs ('when he has completed two thirds of the scenes, he must inform the manager's office'). Once the story outline had been prepared, the artistic director began detailing 'all the materials necessary for the completion of the film'. He had the opportunity of suggesting 'those changes that appear useful to him, although once the script has reached a definitive version, he cannot but follow the written instructions'. When the production plan was set, the film director negotiated with the front office and with other directors for the use of available studios. Then the shooting might begin, regulated by a pre- cise daily schedule. During shooting, the director's authority depended on the cameraman who had the final word on outside lighting. The equivalent of the stage director had the responsibility to 'have the set ready half-an-hour before the beginning of each shooting session'. Actors were required to show up on the set 'dressed, with their make-up done, and ready to follow the director's order'. At the end of the day, a technician developed the dailies, verified their quality, and approved them for editing. In post-production, the director had 'the right to be present during editing, if he so wishes, and to express his comments on the proc- ess'. Pastrone divided the assignments according to a vertical structure, still hesitating between a direct (almost artisanal) control of every step of the process and a hierarchical distribution of tasks. At Itala in the early 1 91 Os several production modes coexisted.12 They ranged from a sort of director system, which differentiated between 'scriptwriter', director, and cameraman, to a distant approxima- tion of the American central producer system, characterised by serial production, multiple shoot- ing units, and a strong division of roles between director and producer. In the Italian context, in fact, there was not such a figure as the producer, whose position would have been between the director and the chief executive. But Itala had Giovanni Pastrone. Pastrone's position and role illustrate Itala's peculiar internal organisation. He was a co-owner, really a minority shareholder, so unlike such American producers as Griffith, he could exercise direct control over the capital invested. More pre- cisely, Pastrone's role was similar to the one played by Thomas Ince: he oversaw in detail the prepara- tion and production of all Itala's films.13 With ref- erence to the American model, Pastrone furthered the distinction between central producer and direc- tor in his relationship with the other directors at Itala. As for his own professional profile, however, such distinction was meaningless. He was both, central producer and director until the end of his career in 1923. Trained within the old operator system, he knew all the crafts and skills of film production. But by combining the owner-pro- ducer's common disposition for vertical hierarchy and personalised supervision, with the modern labour and management divisions, Pastrone be- came a unique kind of producer in the panorama of Italian film industry. Between 1 909 and 1 912, Pastrone set out to develop a professional and elaborately articulated staff at Itala. By hiring several talented cameramen and directors from French and Italian companies, he created a script department.14 From the early 1 91 Os, he had an average of six directors working yearly at Itala.15 In 1912, he hired one of the world's most talented experts in optical effects, Segundo de Chomon, a decision that had an im- Silvio Alovisio</page><page sequence="4">The 'Pastrone System': Itala Film from the origins to World War I Fig. 2.

New performers arrived both from France and from Turin's surrounding region, trained in either films or in vernacular and amateur theatre. Thus, Itala's collaboration with one of Europe's most re- nowned stage actor Ermete Zacconi, was quite exceptional. In the early 1910s, Zacconi acted in two successful Itala films: Padre (Palace of Flame, 1912), directed by Gino Zaccaria, and Lo scom- parso [Disappeared, 1913], directed by Dante Testa. Politics of genre When Itala was established, only a few genres had been explored by Italian film production: drama, comedy, and the actuality.17 After 1911, the de- velopment of the feature film caused the decline of the actualities and the expansion of comic sub- jects into longer comedies. Since Itala intended to invest and grow on an industrial level, none of these four genres was excluded. What was needed were clear manufacturing procedures for each genre so as to achieve production optimisation, consistency and novelty. Pathe had already devel- oped production standards and routines as early as 1904; Cines followed in 1907 and Ambrosio in 1 908. Within a short time, Itala, too, reached the same levels, both in terms of variety and quan- tity of film output. The chart (Fig. 3) offers a comparative over- view of four companies' film production between 1908 and 1914.18 If the Pathe column offers evi- dence of the remarkable superiority of the French company, the table suggests that by 1908 Itala, together with Cines and Ambrosio, led the domes- tic output.'9 That year, the newly born Turinese company (together with Carlo Rossi) comprised about thirty per cent of the total domestic produc- tion, while Cines and Ambrosio each contributed twenty per cent. In 1909 and 1910 the pace of production further increased due to the arrival of actor-directorAndre Deed, but between 1 910 and 1911 Itala's output began to decline. Itala would never return to its market dominance. By 1911, with about twenty production companies working in the country, Itala's share was reduced to ten per cent. Deed's departure even affected the average film length, which fell to less than 1000 feet. After 1912, the production of actualities, so crucial in the first years, almost disappeared.20 In 1913, with the beginning of the Cabiria project, the production gap between Itala and the other Italian firms widened dramatically. That year, Itala produced only five per cent of the national output, while Cines contributed a remarkable twenty-five per cent. To better assess this situation, one must note that 1913 marked the definitive establishment of feature film production in Italy. Itala was among the most enthusiastic supporters of this change and the quickestto drop the produc- tion of shorts and comiche (short comedies). With the historical epic La caduta di Troia (The Fall of Troy, 191 1), Itala was the first Italian film company to step beyond the 600-metre mark and to define two-reelers as 'feature films'. The com- pany repeated itself that year with the Grand Guig- nolesque drama La cella n. 13 (Cell n. 13, m.610). An increase in footage was not granted to the genre of the historical epic and modern adventure drama without reason. Both had deep ties to popu- lar entertainments like feuilettons and theatrical melodramas, but were also linked to the more cul- turally prestigious domain of literary and historical classics. Thus they better embodied the goals of social expansion and cultural amelioration that Itala and other film producers had sought since 1910-11. Itala's first feature films attempted to combine literary ambitions with highly spectacular visual de- lights. The production alternated between austere but edifying films such asAmore d'oltre tomba (Af- ter Darkness, Light, 1912) and The Pa/ace of Flame, and adventure stories such as Vittoria o morte [Victory or Death, 191 3], Tigris (1913), or violent and unsettling dramas such as I misteri della psiche (The Mysteries of Souls, 1912). Unlike Ambrosio and Cines, Itala did not devote feature production to the genre of comedy, preferring in- stead the release of two-reel comiche such as those starring Mario Morais and Ernesto Vaser. By 1 91 3-1 4, the two-reel format was no longer syn- onymous with the feature film. The company reacted quite conservatively to the outbreak of WWI: production was temporarily suspended, then shortly resumed while the work- force was cut. Because of its previous sparse out- Silvio Alovisio</page><page sequence="6">The 'Pastrone System': Itala Film from the origins to World War I put, Itala did not suffer the war crisis as much as Ambrosio and Cines, whose production decreased quite dramatically. Types of comedies and serialisations As already mentioned, Itala first invested in short comedies (comiche), from a fraction of a reel to up to two reels. In 1908, the percentage of comiche represented twenty to twenty-five per cent of Itala's yearly output (the same at Cines, al- though Itala produced more titles). In 1909, due to the arrival of actor and director Andre Deed, that percentage climbed to forty per cent and in 1 91 0 it reached the peak of forty-five per cent.21 Itala's short comedies were of three kinds. The first one was the trick comedy, which was usually very short (less than 200 feet). The comic effect was tied to a bald subversion of common sense and the conventions of everyday life. A frequent strategy, common to the French genre of dislocations mysterieuses, was the dismembering and recom- position of the human body, as in Un uomo a pezzi (Man in Piece[s], 1 908) orChi ha visto la mia testa? (Who Has Seen My Head?, 1908). Ordinary ob- jects became animated or provoked unusual reac- tions, as in Armadio misterioso [The Mysterious Wardrobe, 1 908] and Le peripezie di un materasso [Adventures of a Mattress, 1 908, Carlo Rossi]. The second type was the farcical comic scene. The prototype was Lumiere's L'arroseur arrose, but what changed was the length (up to 400 feet in 1908) and thus the narrative articulation. Typical were the reproductions of sketches from variety theatre, as in II cugino mangiatore di tartufi (He Is a Cousin Who Eats the Truffle, 1908) or II signor Testardo (Mr. Stubborn, 1910). Mostly, the sub- genre comprised reversals of social and biological order. Animals assumed anthropomorphic fea- tures in films like II cavallo salvatore (Horse to the Rescue, 1908) and II cane spazzacamino (Sweep Dog, 1910). Women displayed a heretofore un- known violence, as in Una signora furiosa [An En- raged Woman, 1908]. Rituals of honour were usually dissolved into grotesque parodies like II duello dei paurosi (Timid Duellers, 1908) while social roles were suspended in films like Lo sciop- ero dei lattanti (Baby Strike, 1 908). The most vul- gar parodies were often alternated with social farces or micro-pochade, adapted from the tradi- tion of French vaudeville's comedies of marriage life, such as Discussione ad oltranza (You Shall Pay for It, 1 909) and II capodanno della gelosa (Jeal- ous Wife's New Year's Day, 1910). The trivial na- ture of these carnivalesque inversions combined with the characters-heroes' limited interest in the outside world (as was the case with Deed) kept these comiche from being socially subversive. In- stead, their ideological ambiguity displayed con- servative traits: they ended up enforcing an ultimate sense of interclass compromise and unas- sailable social stability. The last comic type was the chase comedy, one of Itala's specialties. The chessboard topogra- phy of the residential quarters outside Turin be- came an ideal scenery for the construction of a composite space that could be crossed by both famous and anonymous comedians. In the first months of 1 909, the hiring of Andre Deed and the beginning of a series based on a single well-developed character, Cretinetti (known in the US as 'Foolshead'), made Itala's comic pro- duction grow in quality. At Itala, Deed made more than one hundred films, enabling the Turinese firm to be not just the first, but the only Italian company to make serial comedies, at least through 1909. After Deed's arrival, the key word at Itala was standardisation, which extended its meaning from production to distribution. The comic genre be- came Itala's main resource for access to interna- tional markets.22 The famous dilemma of whom to engage from Pathe, Andre Deed or Max Linder, was solved by opting for the comic who had first established and perfected serial production. Deed had started the Boireau series as early as 1906, whereas Linder began only in 1 909. By acquiring Deed's celebrity and experience, Itala quickly grew, both financially and professionally.23 In Cretinetti's serial comedies, the genre's fa- cility to draw from a variety of sources became institutionalised. On the one hand, Deed's charac- terisations owed a special debt to Nice's vernacu- lartheatre, songs, and jokes, but also to the French performative tradition of the Folies Bergeres, Thea- tre du Chatelet, Melies's trick films, as well as Pathe's chase comedies (poursuites). On the other hand, through Deed's example the compound structure of the genre was crystallised in an efficient industrial format. The collaboration between Deed 255</page><page sequence="7">256 Silvio Alovisio Fig. 4. One of the several comedies produced by Itala Film: Cretinetti volontario della Croce Rossa (Foolshead, Volunteer of the Red Cross; Itala Film, 1910), starring Andre Deed (far left). [Courtesy of Museo Nazionale del Cinema (Turin).] and Pastrone allowed a centralised scheduling of production. Itala's film product became easily ex- portable due to the combination of trademark and character, independent of the quality of any single film. Standardisation as well as recognition and demand of a brand name were the traits of a blos- soming industrial aesthetics. Deed played a char- acter recognisable by his repeated actions, consistent world vision, and frantic narratives. For Cretinetti, space became a medium in which to communicate a restless and dynamic cosmology. The obsessive presence of spatial thresholds (sky- light, doors, windows, elevators, stairs, shop win- dows, etc) highlighted by a uniquely systematic use of long shots, emphasised Cretinetti's inability to inhabit ordinary spaces or places. For him, the streets of Turin were simply passageways in which to venture and from which violate, the thresholds of households, shops and cafes. Attracted to and rejected by indoor and outdoor spaces, higherand lower places, even Paradise and Hell - staged in Come fu che I'ingordigia rovino il Natale a Cret- inetti (Greediness Spoils Foolshead's Christmas, 1 91 0) -Cretinetti cannot remain still. Rest or stasis are not allowed him. This compulsive and neurotic mise-en-scene postulated and reinforced the star's precise spatial cosmology. The persistence of this cosmology defined both the character's aesthetic and his serial marketability. The historical film: from tableau vivant to the quality film Throughout 1 908-09, Italian film companies sys- tematically structured their production around film genres. The combination of spectacular value, pedagogical significance, and cultural status launched the historical film as the most prestigious and profitable genre. The staging of history allowed Italian cinema to gain esthetic le- gitimacy and commercial viability among bour- geois audiences. Pastrone's move from the 210 metres of Una congiura contro Napoleone I [Plot- 256 Silvio Alovisio</page><page sequence="8">The 'Pastrone System': Itala Film from the origins to World War I Fig. 5. La caduta di Troia (The Fall of Troy, Itala Film, 1911) by Giovanni Pastrone and Romano Luigi Borgnetto. [Courtesy of Museo Nazionale del Cinema (Turin).] ting against Napoleon I, 1909] to the famous 3500 metres of Cabiria (1 91 4) is the best example of this progress. At Itala, the exploitation of the genre was sys- tematic without being intense. Between 1908 and 1 91 1, the company produced 'only' fifteen histori- cal films, and in later years the annual output de- creased, in concurrence with the production of Cabiria. In 1908, the average length of an Itala historical film was approximately 180-200 me- tres, or two-thirds of a reel, a size long enough for narratives rich in ellipses and tableaux vivants. The pedagogical exposition was often concentrated in the depiction of a single exceptional event, the historical biography's key episode, or in the simple depiction of a past historical setting.24 Between 1909 and 1911, the historical genre gained wide international success, developed new ambitions, and extended its average length. In 1909, Giulio Cesare (Julius Caesar) and Napoleone e la principessa di Hatzfeld (Napoleon and Princess Hatzfeld) achieved great economic and critical success in America. A year later, the distribution of Isabella di Aragona (Isabel of Aragona), Luisa Strozzi (Louise Strozzi), and Ag- nese Visconti (Agnes Visconti) did not encounter similar enthusiasm, but 1911 was a triumphant year. The Fall of Troy, a daring production of 610 metres, was groundbreaking and served as an ex- ample forfuture productions. It was followed by the shorter (but still lengthy for the times) Clio e Filete (Clios and Phyletes, 475m).25 After The Fall of Troy, the combination of feature production and histori- cal film became indivisible. The extended length enabled the solution of the genre's two main con- cerns: the improvement of set designs for spec- tacular effects and the extension of subjects' variety (biographies and literary adaptations) to achieve narrative sophistication. The overall ambition, in Pastrone's retrospective observations, was that 'cinema had to be presented as an art'.26 Indeed, the association of cinema as a poten- tially popular medium with the texts and symbols of highbrow culture started quite early at Itala. The 257</page><page sequence="9">258 Silvio Alovisio 1908 historical productions were much more than simple depictions of past anec- S i: iB dotes. Although constrained i .. by a short format, they com- t | bined popular iconography |- with adaptations from known historical biogra- phies or major literary works, such as Giulio Cesare (Julius Caesar, 1908), Principessa p e schiava (Princess and Slave, 1909) and the al- ready mentioned The Fall of Troy and Clios and Phyletes. Others were adaptations of contemporary sources as in Niccolo de' Lapi (Niccolo De Lapi, 1909) from Massimo Fig. 6. Giovanni P&lt; D'Azeglio's historical novel (tala Film, 1914). (1 866), La maschera di ferro [Courtesy of Muse&lt; (The Iron Mask, 1909) from the famous work of Alexander Dumas pere, and La marchesa Ansperti (Marchioness of Ansperti, 1911), adapted from Gerolamo Rovetta's play, Romanticismo (1 902), which was also made into a film by Cines, Film Artistica Gloria and Ambrosio. Overall, Itala's historical production was or- ganised around three major strands. The first mainly catered to the domestic market and dealt with the drama of political unification. Some exam- ples include: / carbonari [The Conspirators, 1 908], Vita per vita (Life for a Life, 1 909), and La figlia del patriota [The Patriot's Daughter, 1909]. The sec- ond strand comprised productions set in medieval and Renaissance times, which aimed at both do- mestic and international markets. Interestingly, be- tween 1910 and 1911, Itala made six biopics devoted to important women living in that period: Agnese Visconti (Agnes Visconti, 1910), Isabella d'Aragona (Isabelle of Aragon, 1910), Caterina duchessa di Guisa (Chaterina, Duchess of Guisa, 1910), Ginevra di Scozia (1910), Luisa Strozzi (Louise Strozzi, 1911) and Giovanna di Braganza (Joanna of Braganza, 1911). The third strand of films regarded those his- torical and biographical productions primarily made for the European markets, especially France and England - apparently the American market astrone (left, wearing a hat) on the set of Cabiria o Nazionale del Cinema (Turin).] favoured historical epics set in Greek and Roman times. Titles such as II sire di Montmorency (Lord of Montmorency, 1909), Linda di Chamounix (Linda of Chamouny, 1910), Giovanni Milton (John Mil- ton, 191 1), II cinque marzo [5 March 1910], were all productions that staged events unrelated to It- aly's past history and culture, but that dealt with modern and contemporary historical events, such as the French Revolution. Between paradigm and exception: the case of Cabiria As mentioned above, the crisis of 1 908-09 ended with a strong production increase. The progres- sive systematisation of production and distribution changed the ways Italian movies were designed and marketed. The ultimate combination of finan- cial shrewdness and technical skills was best em- bodied a few years later by Cabiria. The film occupied a contradictory place within the 'Itala system', caught between tradition and innovation. On the one hand, Cabiria continued Itala's and Italian cinema's inclination toward monumen- tal historical production, learned cultural refer- ences, and widely popular spectacular appeal.27 But, Pastrone's plan to complete something excep- tional - in terms of length, profusion of means, and Silvio Alovisio 258</page><page sequence="10">The 'Pastrone System': Itala Film from the origins to World War I cultural status - ended up depressing the pace and standards of the company's ordinary production. And this occurred in 1912 while Itala was gaining momen- tum in domestic and foreign markets. If Cabiria's success appeared to have opened up rich distribution possibili- ties while the film's profits encouraged further expan- sion of studio facilities, the film could not establish any new commercial standards. The economic and labour resources invested in the film's completion had been excessive and dispropor- tionate: its success made Itala's exports dramatically Fig. 7.

At the beginning of WWI, Pastrone moved to other spectacular gen- res, mainly opting for the modern passionate drama casting 'irresistible divas', or for the serial adventures centred on the muscular Maciste. Balanced between continuity and difference, Cabiria reinforced the European cinema's stylistic paradigm based on the centrality of the shot (or its 'autarchy', as Noel Burch has defined it), at the expense of editing.28 But by adopting the excep- tional solution of the tracking shot, while remain- ing within the traditional boundaries of the single shot, the film resulted in something quite innova- tive. In Cabiria, one can detect the safe experimen- tal innovations realised in Itala's previous films: the panning shots of The Fall of Troy, the visionary special effects of Tigris, and also the narrative sym- metries of Come una sorella [Like a Sister, 1912]. We might describe Pastrone's typical tactics as in- spired by the desire to renew styles and productions and devise new 'functional equivalents', while safely respecting proven commercial standards.29 Experimentation and new stylistic possibilities did not initiate a legacy, even if one considers such sophisticated films later as II fuoco [Fire, 1 91 5] and Tigre reale [Royal Tiger, 1916]. After 1914, Pas- trone failed in his ambition to create a modern company, capable of producing both standard commercial products as well as films of excep- tional artistic quality.

See Franco Prono, 'Atti di nascita del cinema a Torino', in Ira Fabri (ed.), Le fabbriche della fantas- ticheria (Turin: Aleph, 1 993), 81. 6. Recent archival research has shed light on Itala's financial history, although the exact date of its foun- dation is still uncertain. See Silvio Alovisio, 'Proposte di studio su un archivio aziendale. L'ltala Film negli archivi del Museo Nazionale del Cinema di Torino', in NSB, 73-87. 7. The first to reach the British market via The Hepworth Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Rossi &amp; C. had also estab- lished solid contacts with Germany (via Otto Schmidt), France and Belgium (via Paul Hodel). On December 1907, the Turinese company had also started exporting in the US, under contract with the Chicago-based Kleine Optical Co. 8. See A. Bernardini, 'An Industry in Recession: The Italian Film Industry 1908-1909', Film History 3, no. 4 (1989): 341-368 and Riccardo Redi, 'La crisi del 1909 e il Congres des dupes', Immagine 33 (Winter 1995-1996): 6-16. 9.

A Bison Register (#101) is preserved in the Itala Film Collection (Al 60/6), Museo Nazionale del Cinema (Turin). 11. See Itala Film Collection, A159/3.

For distinctions among modes of production, see David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, and Kristin Thompson, The Classical Hollywood Cinema (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985). In particu- lar, see Janet Staiger, 'The Hollywood mode of production to 1930', pp. 85-153. 13. Pastrone himself recognised the dualism of his role at Itala: 'I was a director, but I was also an industri- alist, or better a businessman. I had to recoup the investments, and my films had to persuade distribu- tors that they were doing great business.' See G. Sadoul, 'A colloquio con Giovanni Pastrone', Cen- trofilm 14 (1960): 1 1. The parallel between Pastrone and Ince is suggested in Paolo Cherchi Usai (ed.), Giovanni Pastrone e gli anni d'oro del cinema a Turin (Turin: UTET, 1986), 7-10. 260 Silvio Alovisio</page><page sequence="12">The 'Pastrone System': Itala Film from the origins to World War I 14. The list included Raoul Compte and Georges Cail- laud from Path6, but also Italian technicians Renato Bini and Silvio Cocanari, both 'first generation' employees respectively from SAFFI-Comerio and Cines. Their impact was phenomenal: Giovanni Tomatis, the extraordinary cameraman who shot the African scenes of Cabiria, grew up professionally at Itala. 15. Among the French directors, consider Andr6 Deed and Lucien Nonguet from Path6, and Vincent D6ni- zot from Eclair. Among the Italians, Itala hired Gino Zaccaria and the directors and comedy writers San- dro Camasio and Mario Morais. 16. For an overview of the work and impact of Segundo de Chom6n at Itala Film, see Simona Nosenzo, 'Segundo de Chom6n en la Itala Film: verosimilitud y artificio de lo imposible', Archivos de la Filmoteca 20 (1995): 105-112. 17. In the Italian language it is possible to distinguish long and short comedy by referring to the former as commedia and to the latter as comica. 18. Quantities here discussed refer to film titles not film length. As filmographic sources I have used ACI and Henri Bousquet, Catalogue Path6 des ann6es 1896 6 1914 (Edition Henri Bousquet, 1993-1995). For the year 1908, I have incorporated the production of Carlo Rossi &amp; C. with that of Itala in light of the business continuity between the two firms. 19. Path6's data refers to the production of the French company and to those of its partners (i.e. SCAGL, Film d'Arte Italiana). 20. Between 1909 and 1912, Itala produced about sixty non-fiction films or 10 per cent of its total output. The genre comprised actualities, newsreels, touristic documentaries, commercials, didactic and scientific films - for which Itala was renowned. Interestingly, in 1908 the other major Turinese company, Am- brosio, devoted half of its resources to non-fiction. 21. At Cines the percentage of comedies remained unchanged for 1909, while it climbed to 30-35 per cent in 1910, a comparatively modest increase despite the hiring of Ferdinand Guillaume (Ton- tolini), Lea Giunchi (Lea) and Pacifico Aquilanti (Coc6). 22. The audience's vast appreciation of the genre in- creased the number of copies produced per each comedy, with the result that among Itala's surviving prints, more than 60 per cent are comedies. 23. Itala's representative in Paris, Paul Hodel, would sell Deed's works to exhibitors without even showing them. Cretinetti - known in France as Gribouille- allowed an average profit of 70/80 per cent per print while the standard profit did not exceed 25-30 per cent. See Sadoul, cit., 8. 24. The narrative highlight was, for instance, a violent death in Giordano Bruno (1908), a glorious defeat in L'eroe di Valmy [Hero from Valny, 1908], or the hero's poisoning in II principe di Challant (Prince of Chalant, 1908). In other instances, the main attrac- tion was the historical setting itself, with the events depicted being purely anecdotal, as in Episodio medievale (Medieval Episode, 1908) or Un matri- monio sotto il Terrore (Wedding Under Terror, 1908). 25. In 1910, only two Italian films exceeded the 400- metre length: Cines' Giovanna la Pazza [Johanna, The Mad Queen, 438m] and Film d'Arte Italiana's II Trovatore (437m). 26. Sadoul, 9 27. Films such as Marcantonio e Cleopatra (Antony and Cleopatra, Cines, 1913), Spartaco (Spartacus, Pasquali, 1913), and Nerone eAgrippina [Nero and Agrippina, Gloria, 1914], share the same ambition of 'grand edification'. 28.

The expression is from David Bordwell, 'The classical Hollywood style 1917-1960', in D. Bordwell, J. Staiger, and K. Thompson, 5.
