<plain_text><page sequence="1">STRUCTURAL PATTERNING IN KWAKIUTL ART AND RITUAL ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL Barnard College, Columbia University This article adopts a structuralist perspective to analyse the meaning of Kwakiutl art objects from the late nineteenth century. The Kwakiutl year is divided into two contrasting seasons, the secular period of summer when potlatches are held by descent groups, and the sacred period ofwinter involving ceremonies of initiation into secret societies. The former celebrate relations with ancestral animals, the latter enact relations with supernatural spirits that nevertheless take an animal form. Systematic stylistic devices serve to distinguish ancestral animals depicted in clan crests from their supernatural counterparts. These devices work through the exaggeration or distortion of particular features in representations of the latter. Thus the stylistic and representational contrasts in the art can be shown to correspond with the division of the Kwakiutl year. The investigation of meaning in art is a topic of longstanding interest in anthropology. Several anthropological studies of art have shown how it can convey significant themes within a society. For example, in her study ofWalbiri iconography Munn (1973) likens this graphic or representational system to a language and attempts to derive meaning by relating art to the wider sociocultural order. She links the affective load carried by designs to their instrumental function in bringing about desired ends. Similarly, Wither- spoon (1977) holds that Navajo art expresses the concepts, states and conditions of happiness, goodness and well-being which comprise the Navajo understanding of their way of life. The meaning of Navajo art, according to Witherspoon, is obtained by elucidating the relationship between the characteristics of a work of art (such as a rug or sand painting) and Navajo values, as expressed through the semantic aspects of language. Like Munn and Witherspoon, Forge (1966; 1967; 1973), in his study of Abelam art, sees art as part of a system of communication whose purpose is to convey concepts and values. Art, for Forge, is similar to language. In examining the sociopoliti- cal position of the Abelam artist, he shows how artistic productivity relates to the attainment of leadership positions. In this article, we shall examine messages conveyed in Kwakiutl art relating to basic themes in their culture. In our analysis, we shall adopt a structuralist perspective derived from the work of Levi-Strauss. His approach to art is the same as that which he adopts in his analyses of kinship and mythology. As in these other areas, art is seen as a form of communication. The meaning of an element lies in its position within a relational system, as it does in language. Levi-Strauss observes that 'as is the case with myths, masks, too, cannot be interpreted in and by themselves as separate objects. Looked Man (N.S.) 25, 620-40</page><page sequence="2">ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL 621 upon from the semantic point of view, a myth acquires sense only after it is returned to its transform~ation set' (1979: 12). This is also the case for masks. The richness of the ethnographic record and the striking quality of the art have stimulated some interesting analyses of Northwest Coast material. Using some ofBoas's ideas from Primitive art, which we ourselves discuss below, F. Morphy (1977) charac- terizes symbolic or schematic art as the utilization of a series of features to represent certain animal forms which in turn function as visual representations of social groups. She distinguishes this kind of symbolic art from what she calls 'realistic' art. Faris (1983) sees the function of elaborate aesthetic display at potlatches as a way of emphasizing status in the political-economic sphere. Vastokas (1978) has used a cognitive approach in her examination of Kwakiutl art to demonstrate the presence of general organiza- tional principles such as bilateral symmetry and tripartite structure, but she does not deal with the relationships between the principles embodied in the art and other aspects of Kwakiutl culture. We intend to explore the question of meaning in Kwakiutl art dating from the turn of the century, by relating the art to a basic division in Kwakiutl ritual and culture between baxus (secular) and tsetsequa (sacred). This distinction was made by the Kwakiutl themselves and was expressed in a division of the year into two periods, each with its own appropriate rituals and social structure. A wide variety of carved and painted objects were used and these played an important role in these rituals. This article is about art as anthropologists define it, just as they define religion, kinship and economics. Essentially, these are Western analytical categories. The objects of Kwakiutl material culture which we shall be discussing will be treated analytically as art objects, in the same way that shell money is treated as an economic object. By calling them 'art objects' we do not mean to imply that they cannot simultaneously be viewed analytically as religious objects, economic objects or objects encodingkinship relations. These objects obviously have a variety of meanings and associated behaviours in the world of the Kwakiutl. During the last century, many of the objects we will be considering were removed from their Kwakiutl context, shorn from the drama, music and dance with which they were associated, to be displayed in the static contexts of the world's most famous museums. In these museums, the objects acquired new and different meanings. In this article, we suggest that the pervasive distinction between tsetsequa and baxus is reflected in the art in three ways: 1) Kwakiutl art objects can be classified into two sets corresponding to this distinction. Art objects in one set are used at one time of year, and in one set of ceremonies, while the objects in the other set are similarly limited in their use. 2) There are systematic stylistic differences between the art of baxus and the art of tsetsequa. 3) Stylistic elements characteristic of each of the two sets can be paired. Thus, one stylistic element of a baxus piece may be paired with another stylistic element in the piece in the tsetsequa realm with which it corresponds. In establishing such correspondences, we work within a structuralist paradigm which seeks to determine the underlying patterns linking superficially distinct cultural domains. Social organisation and ceremonial life of the Southern Kwakiutl We begin with a discussion of the relevant ethnographic material. This discussion is based primarily on Boas's ethnographic description of the Southern Kwakiutl around</page><page sequence="3">622 ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL Fort Rupert. Boas's first visit to British Columbia occurred in 1886, and, beginning in the 1890s, he conducted fieldwork among the Kwakiutl, observing the Winter Ceremonial in 1895 and subsequently publishing on it and other topics in 1897. This source, along with the voluminous ethnographic data obtained later by Boas and Hunt in the form of texts, gives us a picture of Kwakiutl culture in the last decades of the nineteenth century. By the time of Boas's first visit to the Kwakiutl, they had experienced almost a century of contact with Europeans. When Vancouver and Manzies, the first Europeans to describe the Kwakiutl, visited the Nimkish village in 1792, its inhabitants were already in possession of Spanish muskets, the result of direct or indirect trade in otter skins. Regular trading relations with Europeans, specifically with the Hudson's Bay Company, began soon after that. The Kwakiutl knew the fur market very well, succeeded in getting the highest prices for their furs, and were regarded as competitors by the Hudson's Bay Company (Codere 1950: 21 sqq.; 1961: 438). In 1849, the first Hudson's Bay trading post was set up with the founding of Fort Rupert. Those Kwakiutl groups that moved to Fort Rupert acted as mediators in the trade between the company and other Indians, became wealthy as a result, and were able to potlatch more frequently (Codere 1961: 455). Fort Rupert remained the most important settlement until 1881, when an agency and mission were set up at Alert Bay, bringing to the Kwakiutl the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, a school, sawmill and canneries. By this time the Kwakiutl were also involved in commercial fishing and lumbering. Though the first Canadian legislation to prohibit the potlatch was passed in 1876, it was not strictly enforced, and the 1890s - when Boas did his fieldwork - marked a period of increase in the frequency and elaboration of potlatches and winter cere- monials. We shall be concerned with the art and ritual of this period. In order to understand the difference between the art of tsetsequa and the art of baxus we must go into some detail about this basic division in Kwakiutl ritual and culture.1 The Kwakiutl division of the year into two distinctive and contrastive periods is reflected in many aspects of their life. The summertime, called baxus, is the period when people are involved in economic activities and when potlatches are held. Boas glosses the term baxus as 'profane', but we characterize it as the secular period. Tsetsequa, which means 'secrets', is the winter period (Boas 1897: 418). During this time, the Kwakiutl believe that a supernatural power is present in and around the villages, which sanctifies all activities. This is the period during which the winter ceremonial is held. In this article, we refer to this time as the sacred season. When the sacred season begins, quarrels, sickness and unhappiness are forgotten. According to Boas, 'the Indians express this alternating of seasons by saying that in summer baxus is on top, the tsetsequa below, and vice versa in winter' (Boas 1897: 418).2 During baxus, Kwakiutl tribes are subdivided into numayms, cognatic descent groups (see Rosman &amp; Rubel 1971). These cognatic descent groups are organized according to basic principles of kinship which are different from those that organize social groups during the tsetsequa winter season. One set of myths, found in the family histories collected by Boas, gives details about the origin of the numayms from particular ancestors, along with names and rites which belong to each numaym (Boas 1921). For every numaym there exists a complete series of ranked names and associated potlatch seats. Each individual can claim numaym membership through either his mother or father, and individuals may belong to more than one numaym.

RUBEL 623 in individuals usually having a single primary numaym affiliation. By bestowing a name owned by a nuhnaym on a child at a potlatch, the numaym formally lays claim to that child. The inheritance of chiefly position, embodied in a name and a seat, is based upon a rule of primogeniture. This division of Kwakiutl society into numayms with chiefs, ranked positions and family histories is operative during baxus. Since numayms and the myths that tell of their origins are associated with baxus, podatches marking the transfer of such names and the telling of myths associated with them are held in the summer, during the baxus period. Potlatches are occasions when guests from other tribes and numayms are called to witness the validation of membership and rank in a numaym by the bestowal of names which have been handed down from the first ancestors. At potlatches, the myth associated with the name is re-enacted, frequently dramatized with masks and other ritual paraphernalia. The rights to use the crests, masks and other forms of decoration are embodied in the myths. As one of the chiefs recounted at a potlatch, 'Indeed, indeed that is the speech to make at the first meeting of these great tribes, 'for we are told by our ancestors that we are to follow the road they made for us to be walked on.... These are the great names of my chief who lived before me, for you, tribes. Now I will tell the history, the myth of our great chief (Boas 1921: 191-3). Here the Kwakiutl chief is collapsing myth and history into a single diachronic record. In Boas's Family histories, he does the same. These histories often begin with an eponymous ancestor who is a bird or an animal, and who is soon transformed into a man, and they then continue up to the time when George Hunt recorded them. The sacred tsetsequa season is introduced by a liminal period. After the an- nouncement that a winter dance is to be held, all must be cleansed and abstention from sexual intercourse is observed. During this time, the whistles which represent the voices of the spirits of the winter dance sound closer and closer to the village, and people use names and songs appropriate to the summer for the last time. When the initiates are captured by the spirits and disappear, the liminal period has ended and tsetsequa has begun. In discussing the relationship between the two seasons, Boas states: 'Thus, at the beginning of the winter ceremonial the social system is changed.... During this period, the place of the clans [numayms] is taken by a number of societies, namely, the groups of all those individuals upon whom the same or almost the same power or secret has been bestowed by one of the spirits' (1897: 418). The origins of the secret societies are embedded in a set of myths which are different from the myths about the origins of the numayms. Secret society myths relate to the acquisition by ancestors of special supernatural powers. These have been transmitted to their descendants for generations. They are acquired through initiation into the secret societies, which takes place during tsetsequa, the sacred period. Boas likens this initiation to the vision quest of the Plains Indians, in which individuals isolate themselves and, through starvation, deprivation and sometimes mutilation, attempt to induce a trance during which a supernatural being appears to them and then becomes that individual's guardian spirit and protector. On the Plains, the number of guardian spirits was unlimited, since each man had his own spirit. Among the Kwakiutl, individuals inherited the equivalent of guardian spirits. From the legends which I have told, it appears that these spirits appeared first to the ancestors of the clan, and I have stated that the same spirits continue to appear to the descendants of these mythical ancestors. The number of spirits is limited, and the same one appeared to ancestors of various clans</page><page sequence="9">624 ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL [numayms] of different tnbes. But in these cases he gave each of his prot&amp;ges his powers in a slightly different form.... the spirits give new names to the men to whom they appear, but these names are in use only during the time when the spirits dwell among the Indians - that is, in winter. Therefore from the moment when the spirits are supposed to be present, all the summer names are dropped, and the members of the nobility [meaning Kwakiutl of the highest rank] take their winter names.... Thus the ha mats'a, nu mal, bear dancers, etc., form each one society, which consists of a limited number of names, because members of the society each derive their membership from the initiation of one of the ancestors of the nobility (Boas 1897: 418-19). Since they are based on different principles of organization, membership of the secret societies cuts across that of the numayms. Rights to become an initiate in a particular secret society follow the same rules as numaym membership, and secret society membership can be acquired through one's mother or father. However, rights to secret society membership are also transferred through marriage and can even leave a numaym. Repurchase ofthe bride by her father (representing her natal numaym)3 almost invariably includes the transfer of winter ceremonial rights from the father to his daughter's husband. This usually means that such rights are being transferred to the daughter's son. The option exists, however, for a son-in-law to give those rights to another heir of his, such as his sister's child. In such a situation the privileges may be passing from one numaym to another. Boas points out that the hamatsa first came to the Kwakiutl through marriage, not more than a century before his first fieldwork among them. Since the ceremony of initiation into the secret societies is exceedingly expensive, it may be combined with a marriage repurchase at a potlatch. However, secret society initiation ceremonies could only be held in the winter during tsetsequa and the marriage repurchase potlatch would be held, in this case, at the same time. Boas gives no information to indicate that the Kwakiutl were concerned by this penetration of baxus into tsetsequa. If marriage repurchase is held at a potlatch during the summer, the box containing the winter ceremonial privileges remains closed and under a blanket, and is not opened until the winter ceremonial is held. Kwakiutl tradition relates that when ancestors obtained their spiritual protectors they were also given both the right to perform certain dances, and certain secret songs. When the initiate emerges from seclusion and performs his song and his dance, he is re-enacting the myth of how his ancestor first acquired the spirit. According to Boas, when the initiate wears his mask and ornaments, 'he personates the spirit' (1897: 396). In this, the initiate has crossed a dividing line and become nau 'alak, supernatural. Boas presents a list of the spirits with whom the ancestors were originally in contact. These spirits are still present today and it is they who capture the initiates. There are several major spirits, but Baxbakualanuxsiwae seems to be the most important, since the spirits whom he controls dominate the winter ceremonies. Baxbakualanuxsiwae is a cannibal who lives in the mountains and is always hunting men. Associated with him are the following subordinate spirits: hamatsa (a cannibal, in whom Baxbakualanuxsiwae has instilled the desire to eat human flesh), hamshamtses (a less violent cannibal), nontsistalal (devourer of fire), nane s Baxbakualanuxsiwae (the cannibal grizzly bear), kinqalalala (his female slave who procures human flesh for the hamatsa), qominoqa (his wife or servant who also procures flesh for the hamatsa), hoxhoku (a fabulous bird who eats men's brains), haialikilal (a friend of Baxbakualanuxsiwae). An initiate comes into contact with either Baxbakualanuxsiwae or any of his subordinates during his initiation, and then becomes the personification of one of the subordinates, the same one that his ancestor personified. Each of these supernatural creatures has his own song and</page><page sequence="10">ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL 625 dance. In addition, there are other spirits, such as nulmal and qoaxqoaxualanuxsiwae, the cannibal raven, and still another class of spirits associated with winalaqilis, the war spirit, who are important in the winter ceremonies. Initiates who personify the spirits discussed above become members of the higher- ranked category of secret societies, known as 'the seals'. This includes the hamatsa, hamshamtses, kinqalalala, nulmal, nane, etc. (Boas 1897: 419). The remaining societies are quequtsa, 'the sparrows', subdivided into small groups on the basis of age and sex. Just as numayms are ranked with respect to one another during baxus, the secret societies are also ranked, with the hamatsa on top. Boas points out how the order of seating at a tsetsequa ceremony indicates the ranking of societies.4 The subdivisions of the quequtsa (sparrows) have animal names. The reason for this sheds light on the Kwakiutl conception ofthe relationship between humans and animals. Boas notes: 'the Indians give the explanation that the ceremonial was instituted at the time when men still had the form of animals.... The present ceremonial is a repetition of the ceremonial performed by the man animals or, as we may say, a dramatization ofthe myth. Therefore the people who do not represent spirits, represent these animals' (1897: 420-1). Two of the female societies are called qaqaqao, 'hens', and mosmos, 'cows'. According to Boas, 'The present societies of the women are quite new, as is shown by their names - hens and cows. The former were called until about twenty years age waxwaxoli' (1897: 419). The winter ceremonies were constantly changing as a result of dances and rituals introduced from other tribes, either through intermarriage or through conquest. These new women's groups are simply another example of this process. The introduction of new dances and rituals meant that the repertoire of dances and secret society personages for each Kwakiutl tribe was somewhat different. Membership in the higher ranked secret societies also confers 'the right to eat human flesh' (Boas 1897: 337). This refers primarily to the hamatsa. During the winter ceremonial which Boas observed, members of the hamatsa society bit people and simulated the eating of human flesh. However, George Hunt, Boas's informant, told that his father had witnessed the killing of a slave from Nanaimo in the early days of Fort Rupert. The slave's body was cut apart and given to the highest hamatsas, and the face of Baxbakualanuxsiwae was carved on a rock on the beach where the body was eaten. The slave's wife cursed the killers, and within five years they all died (1897: 439). The winter ceremonial begins with the abduction of the initiates by the spirits. This is dramatically described as follows: Suddenly the roof of the house shook violently. At the same time, a boy was seen on the entrance of the house being wafted up and down. He hung perfectly limp while he was flying to and fro. Sud- denly he had disappeared. After a short time his bloody clothing and his head ring of red cedar bark fell down through the roof, and soon the bloody clothing of a girl also fell down.... Three of our youths have been taken away by the spirits. Now our winter ceremonial shall begin (Boas 1966: 189). During his seclusion, the initiate acquires knowledge about his supernatural spirit and its magical gifts. The purpose of the winter ceremonial is to bring the youth back and to exorcise the spirit which has seized and possessed him. To do this, the members of all the secret societies perform their winter ceremonial songs and dances, wearing masks and full costumes and using ceremonial paraphernalia, such as rattles. The winter ceremonial is held in a special dance house called lo'peku, meaning 'emptied' because it has been emptied of everything profane. The uninitiated can only enter the house when dances are being performed, and they must stay at the left side of the entrance.</page><page sequence="11">626 ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL There is a relationship between the Kwakiutl winter ceremonial and shamanism. Initiation of novices in the winter ceremonial is analogous in all details to that of a shaman, and 'Among the Kwagul [a Kwakiutl tribe] the participants are all called "shamans..."' (Boas 1966: 135, 172). The shaman is active during the portion of the winter ceremony devoted to the exorcism of the spirit from the initiate. The relationship between animals and humans takes different forms during baxus and during tsetsequa. The ancestral familial relationship between animals and humans is acted out during baxus when family histories are dramatized at potlatches. In these family histories, ancestors are described as the descendants of 'supernatural' animals. Boas refers to 'the numerous tales of ancestors who came from heaven, took off their masks, and became men, for in all these cases the mask has remained the crest of the clan' (1897: 337).5 During baxus, men hunt and eat animals, who may in fact be linked to their ancestors, asking the spirit of the hunted animal not to be offended and to send other animals in the future to be hunted. In contrast to baxus, during tsetsequa the winter ceremonial enacts the relationship between humans and their secret society spirits. These spirits are special forms of supernatural animals, like Cannibal Raven, Cannibal Grizzly Bear, or other 'fabulous creatures', as Boas calls them, who, during tsetsequa, capture and 'devour' the initiates. After their 'deaths' and a period of seclusion, initiates are 'reborn' during the tsetsequa ceremony. It is as though animals and humans have two aspects - one manifested during baxus and the other during tsetsequa - which are inversions of one another. As Reid points out, during baxus humans hunt, kill and eat animals, while during tsetsequa the supernatural animal spirits associated with secret societies hunt and devour human beings (Reid 1976). Boas's ethnographic data deal with the Southern Kwakiutl around Fort Rupert, but there appears to be a basic structure common to all Kwakiutlan-speaking groups. In 1940 Drucker made a study of secret societies, covering those parts of the Kwakiutl area not dealt with by Boas. He looked primarily at the Heiltsuk-speaking Wikeno, Bella Bella and Xaihai, and the Xaisla (Haisla), all Northern Kwakiutl groups. His research indicated that there was a degree of variation between the ritual systems of the Northern and Southern Kwakiutl. He observes that, 'Instead of the single "winter ceremonial" of the Southern Kwakiutl which Boas describes, the northern tribes had two or three distinct ceremonial systems... The general pattern of all of the rituals was the same' (1941: 227). All these groups had a series of dances in the fall, referred to by Drucker as 'Shamans' Series' (tsitsiqua), which include most of the elements of the winter ceremonial described by Boas. They also had a different series of dances in the spring called dluwulaxa or mila, which were usually held in conjunction with potlatches. Drucker notes that the key word tsitsiqua, which is used among the Northern Kwakiutl (with some variations) for the Shaman's Series of dances and among the Southern Kwakiutl (tsetsequa) for the winter ceremonial, is the Heiltsuk word for shaman. Both Drucker and Boas point out that some Southern Kwakiutl tribes, Koskimo, Blunden Harbour, and Neeweetee (La'Lasiqoala in Boas's text, 1895: 621) had two distinct series of dances, like the Northern Kwakiutl. However, most of the Southern Kwakiutl had incorporated these rituals into one tsetsequa ceremonial conducted only in the winter. It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the Kwakiutl organized their life differently during the two seasons of baxus and tsetsequa. The social structures during</page><page sequence="12">ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL 627 the two periods of the year were distinct and the mythic supports for these distinct structures were enacted through the staging ofdifferent ceremonials during each period. Individuals had one name which was used during baxus and another name which was used during tsetsequa, implying that each person had a 'summer' and a 'winter' form. Boas presents the two forms of organization operative at different times of the year as if they were quite distinct. However, there are certain underlying principles which they both share. One of these is the principle of rank, which has one manifestation during baxus, where chiefs make their names - and those of their numayms - great by potlatching, and another during tsetsequa, when humans don masks and are transformed into supernatural creatures which are ranked with respect to one another. Although descent from ancestral animals is enacted in potlatch ritual and depicted in crest art, these animals are not significant in the claims to rank asserted in the potlatch. Rank in this baxus context is the product of human relationships established through a succession of potlatches. During tsetsequa, by contrast, when the numayms are not operative, the secret societies which replace them are ranked and the seating in the ceremonial house graphically expresses this rank system. The masks worn by individuals in tsetsequa are immediately identifiable as representing supernatural creatures with particular rank positions in the hierarchy, though the origin of the hierarchy of spirits and their organizations is not known. In contrast to baxus, where rank is the product of relationships among humans, during tsetsequa rank is a product of the relationship between humans and the supernatural. Nevertheless, those of chiefly rank in the different numayms are also the ones with access to positions in the highest-ranked secret societies. Moreover, the same animals, though in different manifestations, feature in both forms of social organization. Marriage is another principle which breaches the boundary between these forms. Thus, though the rituals of winter and summer have an oppositional relationship to one another, there is also a degree of commonality and interpenetration. Opposition and transformation in Kwakiutl art The art of the Kwakiutl demonstrates the same division which we have discussed above. The art embodied in the masks and ritual paraphernalia that are used in initiation to secret societies, through form and style, proclaims itself to be the art of tsetsequa and thus differentiates itself from the art of baxus. As will be demonstrated below, in style baxus constitutes the unmarked category and tsetsequa the marked category. Together, they form a transformation set. Though the two categories of art share many of the same visual characteristics, and portray different forms ofthe same animals, an additional characteristic marks the art of tsetsequa. In Boas's early work, Primitive art (1955 [1927]), he discusses the art of the Kwakiutl, together with the art of other Northwest Coast societies. He uses the concept of style which he defines to include technical processes, form elements, and systems of ar- rangement of those form elements. The latter two relate to the nature of representation and to the meaning of the art. Boas's analysis focuses on the conceptualization of a single category of 'living things', which includes humans, animals, and forces of nature such as wind, echo, sun and moon, monsters and mythological creatures. These are all personified in an anthropomorphic manner in the art by being given a face. Thus, octopuses, snails, mosquitoes and dragonflies are all depicted with faces. The faces of animals and humans appear very similar, but the placement of ears differentiates them.</page><page sequence="13">628 ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL Humans have ears on the sides of the head and animals' ears are on the top of the head. In nature, hawks do not have external ears or mouths separate from their beaks; however in Kwakiutl art, however, they are portrayed with ears and mouths below their sharply curving beaks. When a mask contains a hawk's beak and ears placed on the side of the head, it is a representation of a 'human'-hawk or mythical man-animal, meaning an ancestor of humans. When the hawk as an animal is being represented artistically, the ears appear on the top of the head. By an artistic device, the Kwakiutl readily recognize the difference between hawk as a man-animal, and hawk as a supernatural bird. The Kwakiutl also distinguish different animal forms according to whether they inhabit the land, the sea or the air. This distinction is reflected in their art in that land animals are portrayed with paws; creatures of the sea with fins; creatures of the air have feathers. The faces of creatures of the air are also modified in that beaks may replace mouths or be added as in the case of the hawk. Animals of the sea include fish and sea mammals in a single category. Kwakiutl art reflects the notion that animals and humans are interchangeable. As shown above, the Kwakiutl believe that in mythic times the ancestors of men were animals. When these animal-ancestors removed their masks, they became human beings and ancestors of particular numayms.6 The mask became the crest of the numaym and just as the mythic animals removed their masks and became humans, present-day humans don the masks and become their eponymous animal ancestors in dramatizing the origin myths of their numayms during potlatches. The unity of man and animals is also illustrated by the fact that the winter ceremonial was said to have come to the Kwakiutl when humans were man-animals (nu'xnemis) and still had animal form. During the winter ceremonial, the initiate returning from the period of seclusion wears the mask of, and personifies, the supernatural animal of the secret society. During both times ofthe year, masks are the means by which men transform themselves into different manifestations of animals. H. Morphy has noted that 'different cultures select different features of animals when representing them in art' (1989: 5). In Kwakiutl artistic representations ofanimals, what is portrayed is not necessarily what we consider to be most distinctive about that animal, but rather the essential characteristics of the animal from the Kwakiutl point of view. Boas shows how these characteristics represent distinctive features which mark the separation of animals from humans, and one animal from another in Kwakiutl art. For example, in masks and other artistic portrayals, the eagle is symbolized by a large curved beak with its point turned downward, the killer whale is symbolized by the large dorsal fin, blow hole, and large head with elongated nostrils, round eye and large mouth with teeth, and the bear is symbolized by large paws, a large mouth with teeth and protruding tongue, a large nose and a sharp upward turn from snout to forehead. Monsters and mythological creatures are represented in the art by combining the distinctive features of one type of creature, for example, wolf, bear or raven, with those of another, for example, killer whale, to produce a Sea Bear, a Sea Wolf or a Sea Raven. Such monstrous creatures represent combinations which cross boundaries. As Morphy notes in his discussion of Fabulous Beasts, 'composite animals can have a cultural reality that may be more revealing than representations of known species because they create sets of species that cross-cut our categories and force us to ask questions about the relationships between those creatures in the cultures concerned'</page><page sequence="14">ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL 629 (Morphy 1989: 5). The 'Fabulous Beasts' of the Kwakiutl cut across their categories as well as ours. The combinations are not however limitless in that there are apparently no mythological creatures which combine features of land and air forms, such as flying bears or flying wolves. Rather, characteristics ofcreatures ofthe sea are always combined with characteristics of one of the other two categories. It is not clear why, for the Kwakiutl, anomalous creatures can cross certain boundaries and not others. Kwakiutl myths recount how humans frequently visit the undersea villages of the killer whale and the sea lion. It is interesting to note that creatures the Tlingit consider anomalous such as the land otter, which lives in two different domains, are associated with shamans and are portrayed on rattles used in shamanic performances (Jonaitis 1986: 89-90). This association of shamans with anomalous creatures also seems to hold among the Kwakiutl. The beings from whom the Kwakiutl shamanic initiate receives his power include such anomalous creatures as lizard, toad, frog and loon. These creatures all occupy more than one domain, either land and water or air and water (Boas 1966: 135). Our hypothesis about the distinction in Kwakiutl art between that associated with baxus and that associated with tsetsequa is supported by an examination of the objects depicted in Hawthorn's Kwakiutl art (1979). The book is a broad-ranging study of Kwakiutl art objects which comes close to representing a compendium of every kind that the Kwakiutl produced. Hawthorn's work draws upon the collection of the University of British Columbia Museum. The material in the book is based upon information from Kwakiutl informants coming to the Museum, rather than on Hawthorn's own fieldwork. Many of the objects were made in the twentieth century, while others came from 'family collections they [the Kwakiutl] were no longer using, as many families abandoned the potlatch feasts and gift giving that had been the core of their social life' (1979: viii).7 For Hawthorn, meaning is equated with function, as it was for Malinowski. The many kinds of utilitarian objects such as hooks, halibut knockers and whistles are categorized on the basis of their uses. Masks are discussed in terms of the person or thing personified, which is identified by a Kwakiutl term, and their ceremonial settings and mythic associations are often provided. These constitute their meaning. Hawthorn notes that 'the beings associated with the winter dances are rarely portrayed outside of these dances and rarely, if ever, shown in representations oflineage myths; but are reserved for the most sacred parts of the winter ceremony' (1979: 29). Many of the best-known Kwakiutl mask types - Crooked Beak (fig. 1), Cannibal Raven (fig. 2), and Nulmal or Fool Dancer (fig. 3) - are used only during the tsetsequa period. In contrast, other types, such as the Raven (fig. 4) and Grizzly Bear (fig. 5) masks representing family crest myths, are used only during baxus. Rattle types and other kinds of decoration also fall into one or the other of these two categories, according to Hawthorn (1979: 94). During tsetsequa, the round rattles are shaken by the he'liq a or healers to pacify the hamatsa when he emerges from seclusion and begins biting people's flesh. They are frequently in the shape of a skull (see fig. 6), and sometimes in the shape of a human head. The chief's raven rattle (see fig. 7) appears to have come to the Kwakiutl originally from the Haida and Tsimshian, by way of the Heiltsuk (Boas 1897: 629-30). This type of rattle was used in ceremonies in which the dancers were not supernaturally possessed in the way in which they were during tsetsequa. They wore masks representing mythological ancestors and in these</page><page sequence="15">630 ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL FIGURE 5. Gnrsly (Gnrzzly) bear mask (Boas 1909, plate L, opposite page 500). ceremonies they re-enacted family myths (Hawthorn 1979: 49, 94). The raven rattle contrasts with the round type of rattle used in tsetsequa. From Hawthorn's information it would seem to be associated with baxus. Sound is a significant element in Kwakiutl ritual drama. According to Hawthorn, 'the use of sound to characterize the ever present supernatural spirits among humans was a very important part of the winter society dances' (1978: 94). The voices of the spirits are represented by whistles. As noted above, the sound of whistles becoming louder signifies the approach of the spirits and the beginning of the winter ceremonial season. Carved batons were beaten on long planks to keep time for the singers and dancers. Whistles, batons, and clappers in use during tsetsequa are not used in baxus. Red cedar bark decorations and the double-headed Sisiutl serpent motif are used only in tsetsequa, while helmet head-dresses and the chief s ceremonial staff are apparently used only in baxus. The division is not absolute since feast dishes, some ladles and spoons seem to be used in both baxus and tsetsequa. Dzonokwa as a mythic figure has several manifestations which are associated with both baxus and tsetsequa. Boas notes that the Dzonokwa of Height, ( inches. Fig 51 Breadtb, 8 inches.

Raven rattle (Boas 1897: 623). the clan legends is a wild woman who lives in the woods and steals children in order to eat them. Dzonokwa, in this instance, would appear to be cannibalistic during baxus, relating, no doubt, to her anomalous status. This form of Dzonokwa is represented on many house posts and masks (Boas 1897: 372). The Dzonokwa of the tsetsequa ceremony is a member of the seal society, who lumbers to her seat guided by a rope, and is otherwise always asleep. She is attired in a bear-skin, to which the mask is attached (Boas 1897: 479). Hawthorn adds still another vision of Dzonokwa, important in the potlatch, as a male wealth-giver, carrying a basket in which the chiefs coppers were stored before distribution. The portrayal of Dzonokwa in masks remains the same, sunken eyes and round protruding mouth, though these masks represent totally different aspects of Dzonokwa in baxus and in tsetsequa. There is a special room for the initiates within the house used for the winter ceremonial. Boas includes a picture which shows an unmasked hamatsa initiate emerg- ing from this room through the mouth of a depiction of a cannibal raven (see fig. 8 for a diorama depicting this). In the picture, the novice is coming out for his first dance. Having been devoured by the cannibal spirit, the initiate emerging from the room is depicted as being regurgitated by the raven. After this, he seems to re-emerge from the side of the room wearing the mask of the cannibal raven which is supposed to be growing out of his body (Boas 1897: 446-7). The numaym house stands in sharp contrast to this (see fig. 9). The house front and its totem pole are elaborately decorated with family-owned crests, all associated with baxus. The numaym house personifies the order and equilibrium of the secular world. In contrast, the house of the winter ceremonial epitomizes the supernatural.</page><page sequence="17">632 ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL Fi-. IS. HOUSE FRONT OF THE CLAN GCI liQAM. NEUNISH. FIGURE 9. House front of a numaym house, Nimkish (Boas 1897: 378). The period of the winter ceremonial is one in which the boundaries of the society are permeable. The initiate bursting through the raven's mouth of the sacred room personifies disorder, the unruly disorder of the shaman.8 Nulmals, the Fool Dancers who help the hamatsa to enforce the rules of the ceremonial also illustrate this disorder (see the nulmal mask in fig. 3). They are filthy, their enormous noses dripping with snot, and they run about throwing stones, hitting people with sticks, breaking boxes, kettles, houses and canoes, and tearing and soiling beautiful new clothing which offends them. As Boas notes, they 'act the madman in every conceivable way' (1897: 466-7). If baxus is a time of sanity and orderliness, then tsetsequa is a time of madness and creative disorder. Not only is there a division between the two times of the year, but also there is a significant qualitative difference between them. During tsetsequa, the Kwakiutl live in the world of the supernatural, an exaggerated and distorted world which the shaman experiences as a result of deprivation or the taking of hallucinogenic drugs. His vision of this world is conveyed in the art used during tsetsequa through grotesqueness and exaggeration. Just as baxus and tsetsequa are in an inverse relationship with one another, so also are the styles of art associated with these two times of the year in a transformational relationship. But this relationship is of a different type. As we have pointed out, certain features of the animal are singled out and used for the representation of that animal in a metonymic fashion. In the form of the animal which is portrayed in the art of the secret societies during tsetsequa, one of those features is exaggerated and made grotesque. The features which represent the</page><page sequence="18">ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL 633 vanous animal forms portrayed during baxus can be said to constitute the unmarked category. The exaggeration of a single feature which characterises the art of tsetsequa makes it the marked category. Within the category of birds, raven and eagle form a contrastive pair, distinguished solely by the shape of the beak. When portrayed in art, the eagle's beak is sharply curved and the raven's beak is straight. This is the way they are represented in masks used in baxus (see figs. 4 and 10). When depicted in masks associated with tsetsequa, beaks are exaggerated, so that the beak of the raven becomes very long, as in the mask of the cannibal raven (fig. 2). One would also expect that the curved beak of the eagle would be transformed into a grotesquely crooked beak of something equivalent to a cannibal eagle. However, neither Hawthorn nor Boas makes reference to a supernatural entity, cannibal eagle, or illustrates a mask depicting such a creature. Instead, Hawthorn lists under the category of 'Hamatsa Bird-Monster Masks' the Galokwudzuwis (Crooked Beak), of which she has many illustrations. However, she does not see Crooked Beak as a monster form of eagle. There are two masks pictured in Boas (1897) which are clearly of the same type as Hawthom's 'Crooked Beak' (fig. 11, compare with fig. 1). In the text and in the captions he identifies these as masks of Baxbakualanuxsiwae, who was mentioned earlier as the chief cannibal spirit, in whose house the other spirits lived (1897: 448, fig. 77, plate 30). In contrast to Boas, Hawthom states that the presence of Baxbakualanuxsiwae is made known through whistling sounds and that he is invisible e~~~ FIGURE 10.

Hence there are no objects depicting Baxbakualanuxsiwae in her book. By pointing out the common feature shared by all depictions of tsetsequa animal forms, that is exaggeration and distortion, our analysis shows that there is a relationship between the artistic representations of two forms of bird-creatures with curved beaks. One is the eagle, which is the representation of a lineage ancestor in its baxus form. The tsetsequa counterpart with its exaggerated beak is the Crooked Beak (whether it represents Baxbakualanuxsiwae or his helper Galokuudzuwus). Wolf and bear are contrasted within the category of land animals by virtue of the different ways the snout is portrayed in masks. The bear's snout is short and blunt (see fig. 5), while that of the wolf is elongated with the nose raised at the end (fig. 12). Features of snout and mouth are exaggerated in the forms of these animals portrayed in the tsetsequa winter ceremonial (figs. 13 &amp; 14). FIGURE 12. Wolf mask (Boas 1909, plate XLII, opposite page 436). FIGURE 13. Grisly (Gnrzzly) bear mask, DzawadEenox tribe (Boas 1909, plate LII, opposite page 520). The caption refers to a myth in a volume of Kwakiutl texts which indicates that this is a winter ceremonial mask.</page><page sequence="21">636 ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL Concluding discussion In this article we have been concerned to stress the importance not only of the ideas which Kwakiutl art encodes, but also of the stylistic features employed to express them. We have tried to shed light on the underlying structure of the art, as it relates to aspects of cognitive structure. In Ucko's terms, we have tried to make inferences 'from visual images about the ways the people who created and used the art thought about the relations between humans and animals' (Ucko 1989: xii). The cognitive structure to which the structure of the art is related is as follows: the Kwakiutl envision a world of living beings in which humans, animals and forces of nature exist on a single continuum. Alongside this world is another, consisting of supernatural, spiritual beings, which are seen only when humans are in contact with the supernatural. This is the world they see themselves entering during the tsetsequa winter ceremonials. While the everyday world of baxus is controlled and orderly, the world of the supernatural they enter during tsetsequa is relatively unrestrained and disorderly, though it has an order of its own. The Kwakiutl see a cyclical relationship between the two: they take turns in being on top. This seems to us to contrast with a vision of the supernatural as inchoate and 'becoming', in which the orderly distinctions of the natural world are not yet established. Two concepts of time seem to be involved here. As conceived during baxus, time is ongoing with a present and a past. It includes a former time when ancestral animals were transformed into men and a present during which men re-enact the myth of how this occurred at potlatches within a current sociopolitical context. However, today they are no longer in contact with the spirits of those ancestral animals. Tsetsequa is in a sense 'out of time' or timeless. The spirits that initiated the ancestors are still present today, and they devour the present-day initiates just as they devoured their ancestors. The organization of the secret societies of tsetsequa are renewed and recreated under the tutelage of the supernatural spirits each winter. We have demonstrated how the structure of these ideas is reflected in Kwakiutl art. Just as the supernatural world represents a transformation of the 'real' world, the stylistic devices in the art for portraying the beings of that supernatural world represent exaggerations of their 'real' counterparts. The exaggeration of one element has me- tonymically come to stand for the whole. As we noted earlier, men and animals are unified on the most abstract level. On a lower level of abstraction (in both life and in art) men are separated from animals. This first occurred when ancestral animals were transformed into men. In a process analogous to giving birth, men were separated from their animal ancestors. In the normal course of events, during baxus, men eat animals, incorporating the animals into themselves and begging their pardon for having to eat them.9 During tsetsequa, initiates eat men, and in the process are human no longer but 'become' supernatural animals. The boundaries separating men, associated with culture, from animals, associated with nature, are breached in the ritual and the art becomes the means for breaching the boundaries, since the wearing of masks is the device that enables men to cross over into the other category. When they don tsetsequa masks, they are also able to carry out tabooed behaviour - to eat other men. Leach's ideas about the relationship between art and the category of taboo are clearly relevant to this analysis. He writes of how art makes possible the crossing of cultural boundaries, and how meaning is to be found in showing the way in which art 'may</page><page sequence="22">ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL 637 be saying what may not be said' (Leach 1973: 227). Elsewhere, he argues that things which are intrinsically ambiguous with regard to a significant boundary are sacred and are therefore given exaggerated treatment (Leach 1983: 256). The art of the Kwakiutl winter ceremonial crosses just such a boundary, and the elements of grotesqueness of that art are an illustration of the stylistic use of exaggeration to portray that which is sacred. The cannibalistic creatures who devour human initiates, portrayed artistically in the winter ceremonial, demonstrate the way in which Kwakiutl art deals with tabooed topics - through distortion. The distinction made by Pasztory (1982) between shamanic art and non-shamanic art is also relevant to the present discussion. She has noted that art on the Northwest Coast associated with shamanism is often made more grotesque and distorted in order to express the emotional content of the trance state. This differentiates these objects from 'more socially motivated' ones (1982: 12). Pasztory's explanation ofthe grotesque- ness of shamanic art would also seem to account for the grotesqueness of tsetsequa art. Boas had earlier pointed to the same kind of contrast in the art of Siberian peoples. He calls attention to the distinction between the crude decoration on the clothing of shamans and the finely detailed applique work on the fishskin clothing worn by people on festive occasions among the Gold tribes of the Amur River area in Siberia (1955: 67). Pursuing this point, Jonaitis (1983) observes that the shamanic art style among the Tlingit is characterized by crudeness and disregard for the conventions of crest art, because it constitutes a visual representation of the supernatural. With regard to the stylistic oppositions between shamanic and secular art, she notes that 'those shamanic art works that are antithetical to artistic standards are not examples of "bad art", but instead visual symbols of the shaman's participation in the realm of the spirit. When the shaman wished to indicate his sacred status during his curing rituals, he displayed to the community art works that did not adhere, perhaps intentionally, to secular conventions of artistry' (1983: 131). In a later, more comprehensive work on the art of the Northern Tlingit, she sees an important distinction between secular or 'crest' art displayed at potlatches and the art of the shaman used in shamanic performances, noting both stylistic and iconographic differences Jonaitis 1986: 25, 26, 32-3). This distinction which Jonaitis makes for Tlingit art, and the oppositional relationship she sees between the two kinds of art and associated ritual, has obvious relevance to the Kwakiutl distinction between baxus and tsetsequa. However, while Tlingit shamanic art is distinguished by the deliberate crudeness of its execution, in Kwakiutl tsetsequa art it is not crudity but exaggeration and distortion that signify the realm of the supernatural. Levi-Strauss long ago recognized that the exceptional feature of Northwest Coast art was the way in which it synthesized the serenity exemplified by Chartres and the carnival atmosphere of the amusement park (Levi-Strauss 1943: 180). We have tried to illuminate the ways in which these contradictory images are employed in the art of the Kwakiutl. The art of tsetsequa conveys this contradictory feeling of both awe and buffoonery. The element of buffoonery, however, is entirely absent from the art of baxus. The stylistic and representational contrasts in the art associated with the two seasons epitomize the differences that the Kwakiutl themselves recognize between them. Together with the forms of social organization and ceremonial life enacted in</page><page sequence="23">638 ABRAHAM ROSMAN &amp; PAULA G. RUBEL each season, the art objects of the Kwakiutl only make sense - as we have shown - when seen as part of a complex transformational set. NOTES We should like to thank Tim Ingold, Howard Morphy, and the two anonymous readers for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this article. l The use of the present tense in this discussion denotes the ethnographic present. 2 This distinction between secular and sacred is at odds with Goldman's (1975) conclusion that all of Kwakiutl life, including the potlatch, should be encompassed within the religious sphere. 3 At a marnage, goods passed from the bnde's numaym to that of the groom at a potlatch. Some time later, usually after a child was born, another potlatch was held at which the bride's numaym gave goods to the groom's. Boas refers to this second potlatch as the repurchase of the bnde. 4 'The order of seats which prevails in summer is also suspended and a new arrangement takes place. The seal society have the seats of honor in the rear of the house, and among them the highest hamatsa has the first seat, in the middle of the rear of the house. At both sides of the hamatsa society sit the bear dancers and other members of the seal society. At the extreme ends of this society sit the nulmal, the messengers of the hamatsa. The killer whale and rock cod societies sit in front of the seal society.... The henelk and the whale society sit next to the nulmal....' (Boas 1897: 436). 5 An example of this is the family history of the numaym Maamtagila, which begins, 'I shall first talk about Matagila, the Grey Seagull. It is said that he was flying along inside of Gwadze. Then he took a rest at Kodagala. Then he desired to have what was a pretty beach and he took off his bird mask and became a man' (Boas 1921: 938). 6 In the mythology of some South American societies, such as the Ge, all creatures were originally human until the divinity turned some of them into animals (Wilbert &amp; Simoneau 1984). This represents a different point of view of animal-human relations from that of the Kwakiutl. 7 Hawthorn further notes that 'with the achievement of greater prosperity and the return of open potlatching, materials came in from the southern Kwakiutl less frequently' (1979: xiv). The Kwakiutl now store their ceremonial regalia at two museums which they have established at Quadra Island and Alert Bay. These museums also contain the potlatch matenal seized by the Canadian Government in 1922, which has now been repatnated. 8 We owe this insight to Tim Ingold. 9 Walens considers the theme of hunger and orality to be central to Kwakiutl culture. Control of hunger is the mark of humanization. The ritual taming of the hamatsa's desire to eat human flesh is seen as 'a metaphonc extension of child socialization' (Walens 1981: 15, 137).
