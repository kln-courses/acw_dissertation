<plain_text><page sequence="1">Attitudes Toward Animals CHRISTINE STEVENS, President, Animal Welfare Institute Teachers of biology in secondary schools are often asked to help students perform surgical or other painful experiments on animals. Such requests usual- ly stem from press reports of organ transplants, space journeys, and similarly dramatic occurrences in science that have struck a young, impressionable mind with a wish to imitate. There are more tangible inducements, too. Cash prizes, free trips, and other emoluments are offered for science-fair projects that have received little or no scrutiny from the humane point of view. The current situation has become so serious that the National Society for Medical Re- search (NSMR) recently issued a revised set of guiding principles drafted by representatives of nine national scientific societies. The principles are based on a reconsideration of the 1959 and 1968 versions, neither of which had succeeded in preventing grue- some abuse of animals by untrained youths. "Guideline" Weaknesses The Animal Welfare Institute (headquarters: New York City) welcomes the tightening of the guiding principles as a step in the right direction but cannot endorse them. The view of one of the organizations that took part in writing the new draft is worth quoting. An editorial by D. A. Price in the October 1, 1969, issue of The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association states in part: Will the revised "Guiding Principles" discourage unacceptable experimental use of animals by secon- dary school children? Hopefully, they will, but much depends on the "qualified adult supervisor" and the "biomedical scientist" whose judgment and attitudes are the only effective deterrent, under the "Guiding Principles," to venturesome students who would re- move organs or disfigure mice, rabbits, or even dogs, and expect the animals to survive. The NSMR pro- vides a highly useful framework for group action by scientific organizations interested in the experimental use of animals. Especially commendable has been NSMR's expressed intention to review the "Guiding Principles" periodically and revise them when neces- sary. Dr. Price also points out that "without restrictive guidelines and informed supervision, some students would attempt survival surgery on the most readily available species, little realizing or caring how ill- equipped they are to perform such procedures with- out training in anatomy, surgical technique, pharma- cology, microbiology, and other disciplines which contribute to the sum total of a surgeon's compe- tence." In fact, students from age 12 onwards have attempted such surgery, and they have won prizes for it and received publicity, money, certificates, and praise. Too often, the genuinely sound scientific work by young people has been passed over by science-fair judges who are impressed by theatricality more than by intellectual achievement. It is unfortunate, too, that a medical degree does not necessarily qualify a person as an educator. Not even parenthood can guarantee his good judg- ment of character development in the child. A start- ling example recently publicized in an Animal Wel- fare Institute Information Re-port involved a little sixth-grade girl whose physician father helped her to win a "Certificate of Merit" by doing brain surgery on rats and watching them die-while she recorded in a large, childish hand their final moments. 77</page><page sequence="2">Rachel Carson, who gave profound thought to this subject, wrote: To the extent that it is ever necessary to put cer- tain questions to nature by placing unnatural re- straints upon living creatures or by subjecting them to unnatural conditions or to changes in their bodily structure, this is a task for the mature scientist. It is essential that the beginning student should first be- come acquainted with the true meaning of his sub- ject through observing the lives of creatures in their relation to each other and to their environment. To begin by asking him to observe artificial conditions is to create in his mind distorted conceptions and to thwart the development of his natural emotional re- sponse to the mysteries of the life stream of which he is a part. Primary Considerations What are the primary considerations of the high school biology teacher? And how do they relate to youthful demands to conduct animal experiments for which neither the student nor the teacher is qualified? 1. High school students should grasp the mean- ing of the scientific method, with its rejection of prejudice and of information which can be demon- strated to be wrong. This essential concept is more likely to be confused than advanced by premature attempts at destroying the perfection of the whole animal. 2. High school students should understand the importance of advanced studies in the different scientific disciplines. They should not be encouraged to suppose that hit-or-miss methods constitute sound scientific inquiry or that brief survival of an animal following amateur surgery is an achievement. 3. In learning to think in biological terms and to appreciate the complexity of life functions, the feelings of living animals should be stressed. The biologist who has no empathy with the subjects of his studies is impoverished by his insensitiveness. The average student who is not continuing into a biological career is hardened and made less humane if his early studies hurt or terrorize animals. 4. The side effects of biological instruction re- quire careful consideration. They may have a dan- gerous relevance to contemporary violence, which is becoming more sadistic in character as gratuitous beatings, torturings, and killings of people and ani- mals become more common in lower and lower age- groups. Such youthful tendencies must cause all educators, regardless of their particular subject, the gravest concern; but they relate most closely to studies in which a choice must be made as to wheth- er pain, fear, and death may be infficted on a captive animal for no purpose greater than the presumed education of the student. The quality of mercy is no less admirable now than it was in Shakespeare's time, and it is more desperately needed in a world of crowded populations and intense technological power. Thus the biology teacher has a special duty and responsibility to teach kindness, gentleness, and modesty as he teaches ways of studying living forms. To break down and analyze is only one form of study. Careful observation, accurate description, precise measurement, overall grasp of the problem, and, most importantly, the ability to imagine and form concepts-all these are vital objectives for students. Cruelty by Imitation-with Help Mere slavish imitation of adult scientists in the news cheapens the objectives and the means of scientific inquiry. Furthermore, if the student ob- tains the extensive aid that immediate supervision by a trained biological scientist often confers, he obtains an unfair advantage over other students competing for prizes in the fair, and the question of who has actually done the project-a question which plagues many thoughtful biology teachers and science fair judges-clouds whatever success the project attains. In a recent case, a girl won a free trip to Washing- ton and $250 for a project in which she starved blinded sparrows to death. She begged off, when criticized for cruelty, by claiming that her whole project was nothing but a description of work she had seen done while on a National Science Founda- tion grant at the University of Texas. The question of whether she was guilty of cruelty, plagiarism, or deliberate misrepresentation in order to win a prize remains unresolved. The Scientific Committee of the Animal Welfare Institute in a recent communication to biologists stated: Experiments involving pain to animals have no place outside legitimate programs for acquisition of new information or in bona fide research institutions and places of higher learning. It is indefensible to hurt or kill animals in the name of scientific inquiry when no knowledge or skill contributing to human or animal welfare or safety is gained thereby. Ele- mentary and secondary school "experimentation" does not meet these criteria. Furthermore, this type of exercise can damage the young student's emotional development by teaching him to rationalize and con- done the unjustified inflicting of pain; it can blunt his intellectual development by giving a false im- pression of the meaning of scientific research. Two Clear and Simple Rules Two rules, whose brevity and simplicity leave no room for doubt and confusion in the mind of student or teacher, have been widely accepted by teachers seeking clear guidelines or their students. At meet- ings of the National Association of Biology Teachers, the National Science Teachers Association, the American Animal Hospital Association, and the American Veterinary Medical Association, the Ani- mal Welfare Institute has presented booth exhibits at which manuals free to teachers were distributed, together with these rules. The great majority of teachers and veterinarians who discussed them 78 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, FEBRUARY, 1970</page><page sequence="3">agreed with the concept they express: the avoidance of any noxious procedure, rather than attempts at limiting such procedures through clauses requiring more or less close, more or less well-qualified super- vision. The supervision clauses in guidelines has not stopped cruel projects by teenagers in the past. Though we welcome any move to limit the amount and degree of pain infliction, nevertheless, we be- lieve high school biology teachers would be better advised to set the following two rules for their students: 1. Animals being observed by students must al- ways be maintained in the maximum possible con- dition of health, comfort, and well-being. 2. No vertebrate animal used in primary or secon- dary school teaching may be subjected to any ex- periment or procedure which interferes with its normal health or causes it pain or distress. If these rules are followed in classroom teaching and announced for use in science fairs, cruelty can be eliminated from high school classes and projects without in any way reducing scientific thinking or the development of the best in young potential biologists. Examples of a Double Standard Contrast the projects of two science-fair winners, both of whose projects reached the stage of exhibi- tion at an international fair: 1. A 17-year-old did extensive tissue-culture stu- dies in order to determine "Viral Effects on Specific Bovine Fetus Cells in Vitro." His paper demonstrat- ed the thorough manner in which he had studied tissue-culture methods, with careful and accurate measurements clearly stated, and his ability to draw conclusions from his work. 2. An 18-year-old had been doing brain surgery on squirrel monkeys for four years and hoped to do one of his operations before television cameras at the science fair. (This was prevented by invoking a state law requiring that animal experimentation be conducted only in licensed institutions.) During the fair, one of the animals that had previously been subjected to his amateur surgical efforts died of infection caused by the surgery, and the necropsy carried out at Michigan State Veterinary College showed the neglect and bungled efforts to implant electrodes in holes the youth had bored in the animal's skull. This was the 25th squirrel monkey to go under his scalpel. He had had advice and "supervision" by doctors at the University of Miss- issippi medical school. The first project conformed to the Animal Wel- fare Institute rules. The second met the standards of the guiding principles in effect at the fair. Whether such projects will continue under the June 1969 guiding principles remains to be seen. Humane Alternatives in Biology The teaching of biology has become more and more important as advancing technology changes radically the conditions under which people live. It is essential that high school graduates have a sound grasp of biological principles, including suf- ficient schooling in ecology and an understanding of the earth as a closed system that must live or die with the waste products of existing human societies. As conservation and the struggle against massive pollution come rapidly to the forefront of human concerns, a humane attitude toward biology teaching becomes increasingly necessary. The wise biology teacher will help his students to appreciate to the fullest extent the variety of life forms, their unique qualities, their beauty and appropriateness to the environment in which they thrive. Many animals and plants are threatened as never before; and for future biologists the disappearence of species is a form of robbery. Every serious teacher of biology has a stake in the preservation of species, for if the biological sciences are to advance broadly the magnificent abundance and the superb quality of living things must be maintained. Biology should be true to its own principles. Ancient prejudices against animals have no place in biology teaching. To mistreat them or to permit them to be mistreated because they are "only ani- mals" suggests that the most elementary biological facts have not been mastered. Anthropomorphism has led to some comic errors in past centuries, but 20th-century thought has been more often plagued with extreme forms of anti-anthropomorphism. This attitude has stultified animal psychology-making it self-conscious and rigid in phraseology and experimental design. New knowledge was nearly impossible to obtain until ethologists entered the field, with their observations obtained far from the little cages with electrified grids that were expected to explain why animals behave as they do. Five-in-One Vaccine A German company has developed a five-in-one vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, and measles. No Petting Young wild animals may be killed by the touch of a human hand. They die from starvation when their mother is frightened away by the scent of man.
