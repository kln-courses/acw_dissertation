A REASSESSMENT Bee Yun Abstract: Ptolemy of Lucca's sympathetic description of republican self-rule together with his unfavourable view of monarchy in the De regimine principum has led many scholars to categorize him as a pioneer of civic republicanism. The present study refutes this common opinion. It illuminates Ptolemy's theory of government through its relationship to the papalism he repeatedly expressed in several works. This study argues that Ptolemy's theory of government in the De regimine principum was inspired by his papalist convictions, and demonstrates how that theory clearly reflected Ptolemy's papalist point of view, especially in the context of the feud between Pope Boniface VIII and the kings of Western Europe, in particular, Philip the Fair of France. Introduction Ptolemy of Lucca (c.1236-c.1327) has long been regarded as the first and most radical republican thinker of the later Middle Ages. In modern his toriography, Ptolemy's thought has been repeatedly described as the earliest manifestation of the ideal of self-government and civic liberty inspired by Aristotelian political philosophy and the experiences in the city communes of Northern Italy.3 1 Institute for Social Sciences, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.

The original title given by Thomas was De regno ad regem Cypri. The manuscript tradition suggests that the title De regimine principum stems from Ptolemy. See Jiirgen Miethke, 'Spatmittelalter, Thomas von Aquin, Aegidius Romanus, Marsilius von Padua', in Die Rezeption der aristotelischen Politik von der Antike bis zum 19. Jahrhundert, ed.

According to him, regal rule, being both repressive and exploitative is basically the same as despotic rule which is, in Aristotelian terminology, rule held over slaves (2.8.2,2.9.2 and 4.8.4). This form of rule is necessary for people who, not knowing the benefits of good government, can only be gov erned by harsh discipline (2.9.5 and 3.11.9). By contrast, political rule desig nates a government by one or by many, according to its own statutes (2.8.1 ). It is suitable for a wise and virtuous people (2.8.4-5 and 2.9.4), such as the citi zens of the Italian city communes and the ancient Roman republic (2.8.1). While this typology of government has increasingly attracted the attention of scholars in the last decades for its radically anti-monarchical and pro republican tone, it has also remained one of the greatest riddles in the history of European political thought, because Ptolemy's discussion in De regimine principum and other works is full of descriptions, estimations and prescrip tions which contradict his very radical typology of government. As scholars have agreed, his argument shows no specific anti-monarchism which is what his typology of government would seem to suggest. Accordingly, it still waits for clarification what argument Ptolemy really intended to convey with his typology of government. The present study will address this question, while illuminating some core aspects of his thought from a new perspective. It will argue that Ptolemy's main inspiration was papalism, not republicanism in the proper sense, and that his theory of government was a direct expression of his papalist commitment. It is undisputed that Ptolemy remained a devoted supporter of the Pope's ultimate authority throughout his life. Ptolemy enhanced his papalist view in various places and occasions throughout his literary career. In his Determinatio compendiosa de iurisdictione imperii (Ά short determination of the jurisdiction of the Roman Empire', henceforth Determinatio compendiosa),6 he ardently defended the prerogative of the Pope to approve the election of the emperor, insisting that without the Pope's approbation no rule could be legitimate.7 In De regimine principum, Ptolemy emphatically vindicated the Pope's supreme power, arguing that the Pope's lordship as the sole dispenser and minister of Christ is elevated above all other lordships (3.10.9) and preferred to all other lords (3.10.11).8 Nevertheless, scholars have hesitated to understand Ptolemy's political ideas in connection with his papalism, because his unfavourable view of regal rule in his typology of government seemed to them to exclude any support 6 Determinatio compendiosa de iurisdictione imperii, ed. M. Krammer (Hanover, Leipzig, 1909). 7 See Jiirgen Miethke, De Potestate papae (Tubingen, 2000), pp. 86-94.

Blythe said: 'Ptolemy's advocacy of political rule for a virtuous people and hostility to monarchy could not be extended to the church without destroying papal monarchy, which would have gone against Ptolemy's most fundamental belief.'9 Thus, Ptolemy's open advocacy of the papal monarchy inevitably became a conundrum for scholars. Charles Till Davis, to whom modern Ptolemy research owes much, once asked: 'What of the great regimen regale presented by the papacy? Can Ptolemy's belief in its virtue and divine ordination be reconciled with his civic republicanism?'10 I will show that these questions are founded upon a misunderstanding of Ptolemy's theory of government and its inspiration. I will first show why his negative characterization of regal rule cannot be an attack on the papacy. I will further argue that Ptolemy's theory of government does not exclude the full acknowledgement of the legitimacy of monarchy. In these explications I will expose some basic assumptions and discursive practices involved in the ecclesiological and political discussions of the later Middle Ages. As will become clear, those who have been puzzled by Ptolemy's theory of govern ment have been misled by ignoring those assumptions and practices. After an explication of Ptolemy's theory of government, I will turn to its historical background. I will focus upon the feud between Pope Boniface VIII and Philip the Fair of France, and the ideological struggle prompted by it. I will argue that Ptolemy's typology of government was a direct reply to the royalist ideology of his time, and that his papalist commitment determined his position toward republican self-rule. It will show Ptolemy as a theoretician who was deeply involved in the struggles which the papacy had to bear in the face of increasing challenges by the territorial monarchies at the beginning of the fourteenth century. Regal Rule: Divine and Secular Most of the confusion surrounding Ptolemy's political ideas has resulted from the failure to properly take into account the radical separation of the divine and the secular in Ptolemy's political thought. Although quite often neglected in modern research on medieval political ideas, an acute awareness of the qualitative difference between the divine and the secular played an important role in the ecclesiological and political writings of medieval authors, and this is true first of all in the case of Ptolemy's political thought. The distinction between the divine and the secular was the fundamental assumption underlying the medieval view of the world. In the later Middle Ages this distinction was further articulated, especially under the strong 9 Ptolemy of Lucca, On the Government of Rulers, trans. Blythe, 'Introduction', pp. 44-5. 10 Davis, 'Roman Patriotism', p. 414.</page><page sequence="5">PTOLEMY OF LUCCA 421 influence of the pseudo-Areopagite's theory of hierarchy. The world which the authors of the later medieval era imagined was like a ladder at the top of which God governs as the source of power and the principle of unity. The divine and the secular, or the spiritual and the corporeal, existed on two differ ent ranks or stairs of this ladder." In the course of the ecclesiological and political controversies since the thirteenth century, the supporters of the power supremacy of the Pope drew on this difference between the two orders to bolster their own position. The spir itual order is placed above the corporeal order according to its superior degree of perfection, and it must guide the latter. Thus, they argued, the secular rulers who represented the corporeal order had to obey the lordship of the Pope whose government was claimed to be divine.12 Ptolemy supported this position. As has already been mentioned, Ptolemy stressed the vertical relationship between spiritual and secular power. But in conceiving the distance between the two power spheres, Ptolemy went much further than other papalist theoreticians. Not only did he stress the qualitative difference between the divine and the secular monarchy, he also attributed to them two opposite origins and characteristics. They are con trasted in Ptolemy's thought just like day and night. Ptolemy's definition of regal rule at the beginning of his discussion in De regimine principum was given exclusively in view of the secular monarchy. According to Ptolemy's explanation in the Determinatio compendiosa, the regal rule of his time had its origin in the perversion of human will and nature in the post-lapsarian period. Originally, in the State of Innocence, the human race knew no such regal rule. The government that existed in that stage of his tory was 'not rule of the kind represented as servitude'. It represented the rela 11 On the development of the medieval notion of hierarchy since the twelfth century, see David E.

This argument was certainly not confined to the papalist theo reticians of Ptolemy's time. This opinion had been common among the authors of earlier times, and was sharpened in the struggle between the Roman Church and the lay rulers of Ptolemy's time.

YUN tionship of consulting and directing, just as among the angels.13 When the original social harmony in the State of Innocence crumbled as the result of the perversion of human will and nature, however, regal rulers such as Cain, Cham, Nimrod, Belus and Ninus14 appeared who, possessed by a sinful lust for domination, wielded their power with haughtiness and arrogance. Besides this regal rule, Ptolemy assumed the existence of another kind of regal rule which had a different origin yet still preserved the original nature of regal rule. Such was the government of Christ. According to Ptolemy, the rule of Christ is far from being tyrannical, but functions according to the principle of consulting and directing. In the nineteenth chapter of the third book of De regimine principum, Ptolemy designated Christ as the first directing, the first consulting and the first moving principle (3.19.2). Ptolemy believed that the papal monarchy embodied Christ's type of regal rule. While invested with the fullness of grace given by Christ (3.10), the gov ernment of the Pope has not been affected by the perversion of human will and nature. It has a different substance. It is no accident that Ptolemy distinguishes papal government from earthly regal rule in the later discussion in De regimine principum, specifying it as sacerdotal-regal (3.10.1)15 — the same attribute that he applies to Christ's rule in the Determinatio compendiosa.'6 Along with Christ, Ptolemy thus designates the Pope as the first directing, the first consulting and the first moving principle (3.19.2). It is consequential that Ptolemy insisted in the Determinatio compendiosa that the papal government of his time share its principle of government with the ancient Roman republic. Just as among the Romans, where the magistrate or consul elected for a year took daily counsel from the senate, the Pope takes counsel from the cardinals.17 13 Determinatio compendiosa, ch. 17, p. 36. 'Licet enim in hominibus etiam in statu innocentie fuisset prelatio, sed alio intuitu et secundum aliam rationem, quia non in quantum dominium opponitur servituti, quia hoc est penale, sed offitio consulendi et dirigendi, sicut in angelis ...'. See Blythe, 'Aristotle's Politics and Ptolemy of Lucca', p. 108. 14 In De regimine principum, he added the rule of Semiramis, the wife of Ninus, to his examples of tyrannies. De regimine principum, 3.7.1. 15 Ptolemy divided rule into four categories there: sacerdotal-regal (sacerdotale et regale similiter), regal (regale solum), political {politicum) and household (oeconomicum). 16 Determinatio compendiosa, ch. 6, p. 16. '... Christus habuit dignitatem sacerdotalem et regalem in summo gradu'. 17 Ibid., ch. 31, pp. 63-4. 'The ancient Romans, as is clear from what I said above, are especially commended for this in the period in which their state flourished. For he to whom they had committed its magistracy or consulate for a year... took counsel daily with the senate concerning the multitude, so that they might do those things that are wor thy. The Roman Church acts in the same way today, for the supreme pontiff takes counsel with the cardinals, who hold the position of senators.

Ille enim, cui</page><page sequence="7">PTOLEMY OF LUCCA 423 It is not difficult to understand what this radical differentiation of the origin and characteristics of the two kinds of regal rule implied. The enormous dif ference between them signifies the unbridgeable dignity gap separating them. The one is heavenly, free from the sin of the flesh, and virtuous, the other by contrast is earthly, the result of sin from the outset, and full of vice. The one is the object of homage, the other of contempt. There can thus be no competition for supremacy between them. It is the duty of the kings of the monarchies of this world to obey the monarch of the heavenly kingdom. Ptolemy's radical differentiation of the divine and the secular power spheres and his dual conceptions of regal rule might be quite perplexing for modern people who have lost the acute sense of the difference between the divine and the secular and their hierarchical relationship. It is therefore fully understand able that, as we have seen above, some scholars expressed their embarrass ment in the face of another conception of regal rule working in his theory of papal government. Overlooking the fine differentiation of the world into several stages of being in Ptolemy's theory of government, they supposed that his definition of regal rule given at the beginning of De regimine principum should automatically apply to all of his discussions on monarchy. But such an undifferentiated view was exactly what the authors of the politi cal literature of the high and later Middle Ages had repeatedly warned against. We find such a warning, for instance, in De regimine civitatum ('On the gov ernment of cities'), written around 1228 by John of Viterbo. After having defined the purpose of the state at the beginning of his discussion, John adds hastily: Ί don't mean the Holy state, the heavenly Jerusalem, which is called the great city, city of our God, whose understanding I will leave for the theolo gians and the heavenly men, because I cannot direct rudely my mouth against heaven. I speak rather about the state of this world.'18 magistratum seu consulatum pro suo anno commiserant. .. cottidie agebat cum senatu consilium de multitudine, ut, que digna sunt, gérant, quemadmodum adhuc hodie Romana observât ecclesia, summus enim pontifex cum cardinalibus, qui locum possident senatorum).'

YUN Because the papal monarchy had generally been believed to belong to the spiritual order since Innocence III,19 medieval authors also concluded that the papal monarchy could not be subjected to the same kind of theoretical scru tiny as the secular states. In his discussion of the dangers of tyranny in the Policraticus (1156-9), John of Salisbury said Ί leave untouched the Roman Church, which on the authority of God is the parent and nurse of faith and moral character and, protected by heavenly privilege, cannot be judged and censured by men'.20 The qualitative difference between papal and secular government and the impossibility of dealing with both kinds of government in the same terms remained a theme even for Niccolô Machiavelli, a representa tive figure of later medieval and Renaissance 'secularism'. He wrote in the eleventh chapter of II Principe: 'Since they [sc. Church principalities] are pro tected by superior cause, to which the human mind does not reach, I omit speaking about them because, since they are set on high and maintained by God, to discuss them would be the act of a man presumptuous and rash.'21 For many authors before and after Ptolemy, it was a taken-for-granted assumption that what was spoken in regard to a human institution did not nec essarily apply to a divine institution because the mystery of the latter exceeds human reason. Their discussion in their political writings concerned the secu lar government. Their treatment of the papal government in those writings was mainly to show the princes why and how they should obey and imitate the government of the Pope. We must understand Ptolemy's typology of government in terms of this general assumption and convention. De regimine principum was a work writ ten for lay rulers about their government. His primary concern in the work was the government of the secular monarchy. It would hardly have occurred 19 Kenneth Pennington, The Prince and the Law, 1200-1600: Sovereignty and Rights in the Western Legal Tradition (Berkeley, LA and Oxford, 1993), pp. 44-5. 20 John of Salisbury, Joannis Saresberiensis Episcopi Carnotensis Policratici sive De Nugis Curialium et Vestigiis Philosophorum Libri VIII, ed.

I cite the English translation from Machiavelli, The Prince, in Machiavelli: The Chief Works and Others, trans. Allan Gilbert, Vol. 1 (Durham, 1965), p. 44. One might regard Machiavelli's remark as a ritualized expression of modesty, or even as ridiculing the holiness of the church-state, as almost all Machiavelli scholars have believed. Even if his remarks were purely rhetorical, they demonstrate that the consciousness of the specificity of papal gov ernment, and the consequent need to consider it differently, was still influential among his contemporaries in the late Italian Renaissance.</page><page sequence="9">PTOLEMY OF LUCCA 425 to Ptolemy (and almost certainly most of his contemporary readers of De regimine principum) that his negative definition of regal rule could be taken as a universal statement concerning all sorts of regal rule, first of all, the regal government of the Pope. Ptolemy's Vision of Self-Limiting Regal Rule When Ptolemy claimed, as was mentioned, in the Determinatio compendiosa that the papal government of his time was founded upon the same principle of directing and consulting as the ancient Roman republic, his intention was surely not to say that the rule of the Pope was also political. Apart from Ptol emy's repeated designation of the papal government as regal, such an under standing was impossible for Ptolemy for the reason that, in his theory, political rule could be realized solely among people who were virtuous enough to take responsibility for their fate by governing themselves. In the Christian kingdom, where the salvation of the soul matters, however, such virtuous and self-sufficient citizens do not exist. Without the guidance of the Supreme Pontiff, no one can reach salvation. All are entirely dependent upon the leadership of the Pope, and regal rule is the sole possible form of government. The model of regal rule that Ptolemy outlines in this characterization of the papal government can be termed 'self-limiting' because it is based upon the voluntary decision of a king to impose certain limitations on his theoretically absolute sovereign power in order to ward off the dangers of arbitrary rule and deterioration into tyranny. The ideal monarch who, although being sovereign and not bound by posi tive law, voluntarily seeks the consultation of other people and bases his deci sion on their consensus had constantly stimulated the imagination of medieval intellectuals." This self-limiting model of kingship can be found, for instance, in the anthropomorphic conception of the monarchy developed by John of Salisbury in which the king, the head in his organic analogy, rules the whole state, the body, in collaboration with the senate which is signified by the heart.23 Accursius, one of the most important glossators of Roman law in the thirteenth century, wrote in his glossaries on the dictum 'princeps legibus 22 On the notion of consensus in medieval political and ecclesiological thought, see Yves Congar, 'Quod omnes tangit ab omnibus tractari et approbari debet', Revue Historique de Droit Français et Etranger, 36 (1958), pp. 210-59 (now in German translation in Grundlagen der modernen Volksvertretung, ed.

YUN solutus est' in Dig. 1.3.31 of Corpus Iuris Civilis: 'The prince is loosened from the law. That is from laws founded by another . . . Nevertheless by his own will he subjects himself.'24 The idea of a kingship which is sovereign, but in which power is shared with the ruled, or, more precisely, with their wisest representatives was also crystallized in the more popular image of the legend ary King Arthur, who ruled his kingdom with his knights around a round table which symbolized cooperation and harmony in medieval imagery. Ptolemy was not the first to draw the papal monarchy in the image of a self limiting kingship. Hostiensis, a key figure in the development of medieval papalism in the thirteenth century, had already described the rule of the Pope in these terms, in glossing the words of Innocent III 'possumus supra ius dispensare' ('we can dispense from the law') in the first recension of his Lectura: 'As if he would say, "We are bound by no law, but are placed above all laws and councils . . . Nevertheless, we will rarely deviate from the com mon law. It is proper that we do this, even though we are not bound to do so." '25 A full understanding of Ptolemy's view of the monarchy is possible only when we take into account the idea of a self-limiting kingship which he believed was realized by the papal monarchy. Like other papalist theoreti cians of his time, Ptolemy believed that the lay rulers should model their gov ernment after the example of Christ and the Pope. He wrote that, as the Evangelical Voice promised, humans could approach the State of Innocence if they imitated Christ in their justice and sanctity (3.9.2). All the secular rul ers in the world should strive for the good of their flocks, that is, the utility of their subjects, as the Pope did in his imitation of Christ (3.10.8). Ptolemy was virtually arguing that the lay kings should endeavour to realize the self-limiting kingship exemplified by the papal monarchy. Ordnungen im Selbstverstàndnis des Mittelalters, ed.

But before condemning Ptolemy for his inconsistency we must take into account the specific discursive practice that existed among medieval authors. In the context of medieval political theories, such an acknowledgment of the necessity and usefulness of repressive power was part of the apologetic scheme for explaining God's permission for evils in the world and did not contain any insistence that a tyrannical regime should continue. This becomes obvious once we look at some representative arguments which similarly find the cause of tyranny in the need to discipline bad people. Isidore of Seville said in his Sententiae ('The Sentences'), that 'when kings are good, it is thanks to God, when they are bad, however, people are to be blamed. According to the merit of people the ruler's way of life is deter mined . . . When God is angry, people get such a king as they deserve on account of their sin.'27 Thomas Aquinas expressed a similar notion in the ear lier part of De regimine principum, saying that tyranny was allowed by God for people's sin ( 1.7.12). These remarks which seem to acknowledge the util ity and even the necessity of bad rule were, however, intended neither to give full justification to tyranny, nor to insist that it should continue further.28 Their 26 See Blythe's remark that Ptolemy uses the term regal rule 'sometimes in the tech nical sense of one ruling without any laws, which he condemns, sometimes as a synonym for king, who could be good'.

'Reges quando boni sunt, muneris esse Dei; quando uero mali, sceleris esse populi. Secundum meritum enim plebium disponitur uita rectorum . . . Irascente enim Deo, talem rectorem populi suscipiunt, qualem pro peccato merentur.' 28 For the history of the concept of the tyrant and its use during the Middle Ages, see first of all Jiirgen Miethke, 'Der Tyrannenmord im spateren Mittelalter: Theorien iiber das Widerstandsrecht gegen ungerechte Herrschaft in der Scholastik', in Friedensethik im Spatmittelalter: Theologie im Ringen urn die gottgegebene Ordnung, ed. Gerhard Beestermôller (Stuttgart, 1999), pp. 24-48. Although medieval authors agreed that tyr anny had to be given up, it did not automatically lead to an acknowledgment of tyrannicide and revolt. On the controversial meaning of the theory of tyrannicide by John of Salisbury, the representative proponent of tyrannicide in the Middle Ages, see Jan van Laarhoven, ' "Thou shalt not slay a tyrant!"

YUN point was to advise people to make efforts to examine their own faults and improve themselves before attempting to abolish tyranny.29 Our discussion demonstrates that Ptolemy's negative characterization of regal rule should not be understood in deterministic terms. It only illuminates the danger of tyranny inherent in one-man rule that is unchecked by collective control and the law. This warns monarchs and other readers that a monarchy which is despotic in its origin, if unchecked, will soon degenerate into a tyrannical regime which exploits its citizens and deprives them of liberty. Ptolemy's practical suggestion is the voluntary subjection of monarchs to col lective control and a respect for the law exemplified by popes and other kings in history. We may term Ptolemy's way of employing the concept of regal rule didactical. Of course, this didactical use of a concept leaves many logical problems in its wake. But it could have been fully legitimate in the discursive practices of medieval political discussions. The case of Gregory the Great illustrates very well how this didactical discursive practice worked. As is well known, Gregory the Great taught that political power, along with slavery, was born out of the sinful lust for domination after the Fall. Thus, for Gregory, state power was a most unnatural form of life that contradicts the pre lapsarian equality among people. It is unnecessary to say that Gregory did not intend with this negative definition of the origin of state power to delegitimize state power itself. His purpose was entirely didactical, namely to bring home to rulers the normative boundary for their governments. All rulers should remember the sinful origins of their power and resist the temptation toward tyranny inherent in their institution. With the original equality among men in mind, they must always make efforts to govern their subjects with love.30 In his typology of government in De regimine principum, Ptolemy prac tised the same discursive practice. His virtual position toward regal rule is well summarized in the following remark in the later part of De regimine prineipum\ 'Despotic rule is in some regions necessary for kings, not because of the nature of regal rule, but on account of the merits and pertinacity of the subject (3.11.9).'3I In this sentence he silently retreats from the negative defi nition of regal rule that he had initially given. Kings are not necessarily des potic; they become despotic only occasionally on account of the sinfulness of 29 In this spirit, Thomas says the following in the De regimine principium: . for a people to deserve to obtain this benefit from God [.sc. the liberation by God from the tyrant], it ought to cease from its sins, for divine permission gives rule over the impious as vengeance for their sins (... ut hoc beneficium populus a deo consequi mereatur, debet a peccatis cessare, quia in ultionem peccati divina permissione impii accipiunt principatum)', De regimine principum, 1.7.12, p. 597. 30 Tôpfer, Urzustand und Siindenfall, pp. 79-84. 31 De regimine principum, p. 558.

On this point Ptolemy is not arguing differently from other medieval authors. It is apparent that for Ptolemy the question of a concrete constitutional form, whether regal rule or political rule, was not a decisive criterion for assessing the quality of a government. Good regal rule can be as desirable as good political rule. In this respect Ptolemy shared again in the common atti tude of his time. In their discussions on good government, authors of the later Middle Ages did not pay much attention to the differences between govern mental forms. This situation did not change even after the introduction of Aristotle's Politics. Most took a relativist stance when discussing the forms of government and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Although the authors of the fourteenth century, while commenting and explicating Aris totle's theory of government, often discussed the subject of an ideal govern ment, they mostly agreed that there were no absolute truths in the matter. Both a monarchy and a republic could enhance the welfare and political liberty of a people.32 Now we can understand why there is no single remark about resistance against regal rule in Ptolemy's entire work. Blythe once wondered: 'Ptolemy could have insisted that since all kingships are despotic, every people should work for its overthrow and the establishment of a political government under the control of the whole people. This would have made him the earliest of the radical Aristotelian proponents of republicanism.'33 He suggested as a solu tion that Ptolemy's 'Augustinian' conviction that even perverted rule is born of the necessity to correct a perverted people might have led him to affirm its 32 Janet Coleman, in her study on the concept of liberty in the political ideas of the later Middle Ages, summarized the situation most adequately as follows: 'Political theo rists on one hand, and citizens or subjects on the other, were less concerned with the monarchical or republican shape of their constitutions than with the maintenance of com munal liberties against the licence of magnates.' Janet Coleman, 'Structural Realities of Power: The Theory and Practice of Monarchies and Republics in Relation to Personal and Collective Liberty', in The Propagation of Power in the Medieval West, ed. Martin Gosman etal. (Grôningen, 1997), p. 209. On constitutional relativism, see the excellent survey in Blythe, Ideal Government, esp. ch. 10. Needless to say, this relativist notion is owed partly to the tradition from earlier ages that did not view the obedience to a king as contradicting the liberty of a people, as long as the right of the ruled to participate in the election of the ruler was not denied. See Johannes Fried, 'Ûber den Universalismus der Freiheit im Mittelalter', Historische Zeitschrift, 240(1985), pp. 320-1.

YUN continuation, dispensing with a theory of resistance against it.34 But, as has already been indicated, no medieval thinker understood the 'Augustinian' doctrine as an affirmation of exploitative and repressive rule. The reason for this lack of a theory of resistance against monarchy in Ptolemy's work is sim ple: he was not an anti-monarchist.35 Ptolemy's Refutation of Royalism Ptolemy's theory of government contains a strong warning against the dan gers inherent in unchecked one-man rule and an emphatic argument for self-limiting kingship. Ptolemy was surely not the first to have such a con cern. It was out of the same concern that, for example, Thomas Aquinas, who regarded monarchy as the best form of government, suggested blending the monarchy with elements of collective consultation and the rule of law in his master plan for an ideal government in Summa theologiae,36 But Ptolemy seems to have been more alert to the danger lurking in monarchical govern ment and the need to impose some limitation on it than any other medieval author. 34 Ibid., pp. 24-9. 35 Our discussion shows that there exists no substantial 'contradiction' between Ptol emy's thoughts in the Determinatio compendiosa and De regimine principum. It sheds a light on the recent controversy surrounding the chronology of Ptolemy's work. Tradi tionally the Determinatio compendiosa has been believed to have been written during the late 1270s and early '80s. Based on this chronology, Blythe argued that Ptolemy's politi cal thought evolved from its earlier stage in the Determinatio compendiosa over the course of almost twenty years into the mature Aristotelianism of De regimine principum (Blythe, 'Aristotle's Polities', especially pp. 116-18). However, this traditional chronol ogy has become questionable after Jiirgen Miethke's new dating of the Determinatio compendiosa. Based on his comparison of Ptolemy's arguments with the papal approba tion theory of that time, Miethke convincingly concluded that the work was written around 1300, i.e. only two years before De regimine principum. See Miethke, De potestate papae, pp. 86-94, esp. pp. 88-90 (in his dating he is in agreement with Schmugge, 'Fiadoni, Bartolomeo', p. 320). Blythe is unwilling to accept Miethke's chronology. See Blythe 'Aristotle's Politics', pp. 106-7, n. 15, and Blythe and La Salle, 'Was Ptolemy of Lucca a Civic Humanist?', especially pp. 240-1. By showing that there is no substantial change of position between the arguments in the two works, this study supports Miethke's chronology, which suggests that they were written around the same time, while refuting Blythe's hypothesis of Ptolemy's ideological evolution. 36 See Thomas' s plan for a government 'well mixed out of the monarchy, as far as one leads; out of the aristocracy, as far as the multitude rules according to their virtue; and out of democracy, the rule of a people, as far as those rulers are elected out of the people and the election of the rulers belongs to the people (... bene commixta ex regno, inquantum unus praeest; et aristocratia, inquantum multi principantur secundum virtutem; et ex democratia, idest potestate populi, inquantum ex popularibus possunt eligi principes, et ad populum pertinet electio principum).'

The course of the development of the feud between Boniface and Philip is well known: in the beginning there was a dispute over the taxation of the clergy in France between Boniface and Philip. This clash was followed by Boniface's promulgation of the bull Clericis laicos (25 February 1296) in which he insisted that the clergy should not be subjected to the heavy taxation of lay rulers. The affair was exacerbated by the arrest and condemnation of Bernard Saisset by Philip's court in 1301, which resulted in Boniface's condemnation of Philip and his promulgation of the bull Unam sanctam (18 November 1302), fully confirming the power supremacy of the Pope.37 It ended in an attack on the old Pope in Anagni (7-8 September 1303), which led to the latter's death (12 October 1303).38 Ptolemy's theory of government, especially his strong suspicion of a mon archy's tendency toward despotic rule, accurately reflects the view of the papacy during this period. In Clericis laicos, we already find the lay power holders stigmatized from the very beginning as lawless robbers hostile to the church: 'Antiquity teaches us that laymen are in a high degree hostile to the clergy, a fact which is also made clear by the experiences of the present times; in as much as, not being content with what is destined to them, they strive after what is forbidden to them and loose the reins in pursuit of what is unlawful.'39 This accusation of lay power-holders reflects the atmosphere of the papacy in the face of Philip's challenge. Boniface later threatened to excommunicate 37 Unam sanctam is edited in Les Registres de Boniface VIII, ed. Georges Digard, Vol. 3 (Paris, 1886), n. 5382, cols. 888-90.

YUN Philip 'like a stable-boy' in a speech to the French ambassadors in the consis tory of Anagni (24 June 1302).40 If we compare Ptolemy's theory of government to the royalist claim put forward by the theoreticians and propagandists of the French side at that time, it becomes even clearer that Ptolemy's warning against the danger of tyranny in regal rule and his emphasis on a respect for law and consultation are a direct reply to the challenge of the French camp. We find the royalist argument for mulated in an exemplary manner in the Disputatio inter clericum et militem (Ά Debate between a Clerk and a Knight', hereafter Disputatio) — a brief tractate written by an unknown author around 1302 (i.e. about the same time as Ptolemy's De regimine principum) in the form of a dialogue between a knight and a clergyman.41 In the dialogue, which reflects the actual disputes between the French throne and the papacy, a knight faithfully defends the right of the French king to impose rules upon the clergy for the safety and welfare of the kingdom. The priest's response to this claim is that such a right is reserved only for the emperor.42 The following answer by the knight deserves to be quoted in its entirety, because it clearly shows that the actual debate focused exactly upon the issue Ptolemy addresses in De regimine principum, namely the relation ship between the king's power and the law: 'Just as it is for the emperor to establish laws over the whole empire, and to add to them or withdraw them, so also may the king of France either reject all imperial laws, or change them in whatever way pleases him, or, having proscribed and abolished them from the whole kingdom, promulgate new ones if he likes.'43 With this confirmation of the sovereign right of the French king, the knight gives a warning to the clergy: 'So, lord clerk, curb your tongue and acknowledge that the king by 40 J.A.

Dyson (Bristol, 1999), pp. 12-45. 42 The historical background to this part of the dialogue is an attempt by Boniface to mobilize the German emperor against Philip, which led to the agreement on approbation of Albrecht as emperor in 1302. As can be documented from his letter dated 30 April 1303, Boniface, underlining the supreme power of the emperor over kings in the world, appealed to Albrecht to punish and correct the 'arrogance of the French who say they rec ognize no superior (superbia Gallicana, que dicit, quod non recognoscit superiorem)'.

It is unnecessary to say that Ptolemy never intended to affirm such rule as neces sary or even useful, which would have amounted to giving a letter of indul gence to Philip and other potential challengers to the authority of the Roman Church. Ptolemy's argument was that by respecting the law and the will of their subjects kings should resist the innate danger of their rule. Although Ptolemy's continuation of De regimine principum cannot simply be regarded as political propaganda, his concern for the rule of law and collective consul tation in government is certainly an attempt to refute the challenge of royalist ideology. Seen with the hindsight of modern historians, the difference between Ptol emy and the anonymous author of the Disputatio was not a matter of principle. In fact, the argument of the knight in the Disputatio repeats an old idea in juristic dictum that a king is the emperor in his own kingdom (Rex est imper ator in regno suo), which Jean de Blanot had already formulated in the middle of the thirteenth century.45 This dictum was also known to and even used by the Roman Church, as can be seen in the use of the legal formulation 'the king does not recognize any superior in temporal matters (rex ipse superiorem in temporalibus minime recognoscat)' by Pope Innocent III in his decretal Per venerabilem (1202).46 Concerning the relationship between positive law and the power of the king, there was virtually no difference in principle between Ptolemy and the anonymous author. Although Ptolemy stressed the rule of law and consulta tion, he acknowledged the king's right to take exceptional (i.e. extra-legal) 44 Disputatio, p. 42 (trans, p. 43).

The anonymous author of the Disputatio who claims that the French king may exceed the boundary of the law made clear simultaneously that such a right should only be exercised for the necessity of the kingdom {pro regni necessitatibus), for the exigen cies required by the time {secundum exigentiam temporum)47 and only after a consultation concerning justice and appeals to the reason of his nobles {aequitate et ratione consulta, aut cum suis proceribus).4S As our observations have demonstrated, what separated Ptolemy and the anonymous royalist was not a difference between republicanism and monar chism. It was not as a republican thinker that Ptolemy defended the rule of law and consultation. The real inspiration for his theory of government was his papalist commitment. This will become even clearer when we understand the limit of his sympathy for republican self-rule. Ptolemy: Republican Thinker? Ptolemy's sympathy for the people and the political institutions of Italy's city communes is undeniable. However this sympathy is not independent from his papalism. The city communes in Italy had long been the allies of the papacy in its struggle against the German emperors. Liberty had always been the leit motif in the justification of their alliance. The historical struggle fought by the union of the papacy and the Lombard League in the late twelfth century against Friedrich Barbarossa, the Hohenstaufen emperor, set forth the double slogan, 'the Liberty of the Communes' and 'the Liberty of the Church'.49 By assisting the Pope, the city communes were supposed to be serving the gen eral cause of liberty. It is no wonder that Ptolemy found in the citizens of the communes the uncorrupted nature of man, and in their political regime, the nest of liberty. 47 Disputatio, p. 40 (trans, p. 41). 48 Ibid., p. 42 (trans, p. 43). 49 Gina Fasoli, Friedrich Barbarossa und die Lombardischen Stadte: Konstanzer Arbeitskreis fiir Mittelalterliche Geschichte, Vortrdge und Forschungen, Vol. 12: Problème des 12.

Nevertheless, we can suppose that his ideas and concepts have much in common with that of Guelfs.</page><page sequence="19">PTOLEMY OF LUCCA 435 This explains why Ptolemy's sympathy for republican rule hardly went beyond an emotional dimension, bearing almost no theoretical or practical fruits worthy of the title of republicanism. The limitation of his sympathy is demonstrated by the paradox found in the eighth chapter of the fourth book in De regimine principum where he wrote: Certain other provinces have a virile spirit, a bold heart, and a confidence in their own intelligence, and these cannot be ruled other than by political rule — a common name which must be extended to aristocracy. Such lord ship is especially vigorous in Italy, where, for the reason mentioned, the inhabitants were always less prone to be subjected than others, so that if you should want to bring them under despotic rule, this could not be done, unless the lords tyrannized. This is why the islands in the region, which always had kings and princes, such as Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, always had tyrants (4.8.4).50 Ptolemy's interpretation of the past and present of the Italian provinces and islands in this passage is founded upon and confirms his basic idea that some peoples are destined to live in liberty. The monarchy is able to enforce its rule on such peoples only through the use of violence, on account of its despotic character which goes against the nature of such peoples. One is mistaken, however, if one infers Ptolemy's republicanism from this passage. At that time Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily had been under the rule of monarchs, the first two by James II of Aragon since 1297, the last by Freder ick III since 1296. Especially noteworthy is that these regimes owed their establishment to Pope Boniface VIII, who claimed his right as suzerain over those provinces and islands and gave James the investiture of Sardinia and Corsica in 1297 and consecrated Frederick's rule over Sicily after the Treaty of Caltabellotta (August 1302).5' Ptolemy's position on this policy is impor tant: in all situations he acknowledged and supported Boniface's decisions. 50 De regimine principum, p. 564.

Taie autem dominium maxime in italia viget: unde minus subiicibiles fuerunt semper propter dictam causam. Quod si velis trahere ad despoticum principatum, hoc esse non potest nisi domini tyrannizent: unde partes insulares eiusdem, quae semper habuerunt reges et principes, ut sicilia, Sardinia et Corsica, semper habuerunt tyrannos.' 51 For the general course of the great power struggle in Italy after the Sicilian Ves pers, a popular insurrection against the rule of the French Anjou in 1282, see Steven Runciman, The Sicilian Vespers: A History of the Mediterranean World in the Later Thirteenth Century (Cambridge, 1953), chs. 16-17.

Ptolemy's basic argument was that the Pope, superior to all secular rulers, has the right of transferring a rule and deposing of a ruler according to his judgment. Ptolemy complemented this general argument for papal sover eignty with reference to historical traditions that showed the special bond of those provinces and islands to the Roman Church; Sardinia and Sicily had already been given to the Roman Church by Constantine the Great in honour of his mother;53 Apulia had been under the rule of the Roman Church as a con sequence of the Donation of Constantine·,54 martyrs' blood shed on the soil of Sardinia and Corsica proved once again the special bond of those provinces and islands to the Roman Church.55 It requires no great feat of imagination to infer that Ptolemy would have welcomed the establishment of the monarchi cal regimes in these Italian provinces and islands, which Boniface VIII con ducted in his capacity as suzerain.56 Fodale, 'Sizilien: II.

It might be a matter of dispute exactly who was the official ruler over Sicily at the time of Ptolemy's composition of De regimine principum. Before the Treaty of Caltabellotta Frederick's lordship had been bitterly contested by Charles II of Anjou. Regardless, the exact lordship over Sicily is not a decisive question for our discussion. Charles's rule over Sicily was understood equally as a fief from the Pope. 52 Tractatus de jurisdictione ecclesie super regnum Apulie et Sicilie, in Etienne Baluze and Giovanni Domenico Mansi, Miscellanea, Vol. 1 (Lucca, 1761), cols. 468-73. 53 Ibid., 468b. 54 Ibid., 468a. 55 Ibid., 468a-b. 56 Whether Ptolemy wrote the treatise as direct support of those regimes is uncertain, because we have no exact idea when he wrote it. Those provinces and islands had been the focus of a power struggle among the powerful monarchs throughout most of Ptol emy's literary career. Emilio Panella and Antoine Dondaine dated it to 1308-14.

Thomas Kaeppelli and Emilio</page><page sequence="21">PTOLEMY OF LUCCA 437 We should not think that Ptolemy bent his republicanism in favour of the papalist cause on which he laid more value. Rather, in the eyes of Ptolemy, no liberty was greater than that under the Supreme Pontiff. His assessment of Otto the Great's campaign into Italy against Berengar II, found in the seventh chapter of the Determinatio compendiosa, shows that for him liberty was always synonymous with obedience to the Roman Church. When he approved of Otto's subjugation of Italy, he stressed that it was undertaken 'with the con sent of the papacy' ,57 Therefore, as far as those monarchs acknowledge the Pope's sovereignty over those Italian provinces and islands and obey the guidance of the Roman Church, the concrete form of government did not Panella, Vol. 4 (Rome, 1993), p. 323; and Antoine Dondaine, 'Les "Opuscula Fratris Thomae" chez Ptolémée de Lucques', Archivum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 31 (1961), p. 171. Schmugge agreed with them in his article in Dizionario biografico, p. 320. But 1 did not find in their dating any substantial argument. Blythe seems to have reservations about this estimation but did not submit a new dating. See Blythe, 'Aristotle's Polities', p. 114.1 think, however, it is possible that it was written in the course of or the aftermath of the Treaty of Anagni (June 1295). The ground for my supposition is the contents of Ptolemy's arguments, which strongly allude to the historical events of that time. The problem over Sicily was a central issue in that treaty, in which James agreed to renounce his claim over it, and Boniface's lordship over the island was restituted. The investiture of James as the ruler of Sardinia and Corsica was also decided in this Treaty. Bringing James and Charles to agreement in that treaty, Boniface relied on his claim of lordship as suzerain over those islands. Boniface's argument almost exactly agrees with Ptolemy's in the Tractatus. Ptolemy begins his discussion by criticizing those who stood for the lordship of the German emperor over those islands while denying the Pope such a right, which seems to be an allusion to the protest of Frederick III; he rejected the decisions of the Treaty and made further claims for his lordship over the kingdom of Sicily, by appealing to the imperial right of the Hohenstaufen. All things considered, it may be con cluded that Ptolemy's Tractatus was written against the background of the Treaty of Anagni, and the latest date of Ptolemy's tractate would be the autumn of 1302, when the dispute over Sicily was finally settled through the Treaty of Caltabellotta. Certainly the development of the political dispute in the following years does not make it entirely impossible to date the work between 1308 and 1314. Nevertheless, I prefer my dating, because it seems strange that Ptolemy does not mention in the Tractatus the excommuni cation and deposition of Frederick in 1296, where the principle of papal sovereignty was again manifested by Boniface VIII. As Blythe also notes, the latest event mentioned in the work is from 1283 and, if we date the tractate around 1308 to 1314, as Panella, Dondaine and Schmugge believe, we must explain why Ptolemy omits the important events concerning the lordship over Sicily and Apulia for about twenty-five years after 1283. However, the matter of the date is not too important. Even if the work was written much later, it does not change the fact that Ptolemy would not have objected to the deci sion of Boniface regarding the rule over those provinces and islands. 57 Determinatio compendiosa, p. 27.

YUN matter any longer. This was a natural conclusion for a man like Ptolemy, a firm supporter of the Pope's supremacy. Conclusion Since the middle of the twelfth century, we repeatedly hear voices from the major European countries that assert the sovereign right of their kings.58 In England around the twelfth century, in France in the middle of the thirteenth century and also in Spain and Sicily around the same time, the king was declared to have supreme power in his own territory.59 Although the papal government did not always contest such a claim, it was inevitable in the long run that the insistence on power supremacy by the pope would collide with it. The conflict between Boniface and Philip marks the climax of this collision.60 The conflict opened the floodgates to the pamphlets and tractates which attempted to grasp the relationship of the two mighty powers of Western Europe and to theoretically bolster the causes favoured by them.61 Ptolemy's political thought represents an instance in this ideological struggle. It is not surprising that Ptolemy elaborated the papalist argument in his con tinuation of De regimine principum. Around that time, Thomas was taken to be the theoretical stronghold for the power supremacy of the Pope. Not acci dentally were some passages in Unam sanctam taken directly from Thomas's Contra errores Graecorum.62 Ptolemy also firmly believed that the point of Thomas's idea in De regimine principum was the defence of the power supremacy of the Pope. In the Tractatus, he summarized that Thomas wanted in De regimine principum to teach that 'the priesthood of Christ and conse quently his vicar is preferred to all lordship on account of his commission'.63 While deploying his argument in De regimine principum on behalf of the 58 On the development of the sovereignty idea concerning the secular monarchy, see Calasso, I glossatori; Michael Wilks, The Problem of Sovereignty in the Later Middle Ages (Cambridge, 1963), esp. part. 2; Walther, Impériales Kônigtum; Wyduckel, Princeps legibus solutus; Pennington, The Prince and the Law. 59 Wyduckel, Princeps legibus solutus, pp. 139-41. 60 Ibid., pp. 141-3. 61 For the most recent and compact but informative overview on the production of those works, see Miethke, De potestate papae, pp. 68-82. 62 Tilmann Schmidt, 'Unam sanctam', in Lexikon desMittelalters, Vol. 8 (1997), col. 1215; Watt, 'The Papacy', p. 162; Karl Ubl, 'Die Genese der Bulle Unam sanctam; Anlass, Vorlagen, Intention', in Politische Reflexion in der Welt des spdten Mittelalters: Essays in Honour of Jiirgen Miethke, ed.

Our observations make the traditional attribution of Ptolemy's thought to the republican tradition no longer sustainable. What decisively inspired Ptolemy's radical typology of government was the need to counter the royalist claims of his time. Similarly we must be cautious in speaking about the decisive influence of an Aristotelian political view on his political ideas. Although the Aristotelian theory of government provided him with useful conceptual tools, it was not under its banner that Ptolemy developed his political view. Although Ptolemy's political thought is papalist, it also marks an important phase that European republican language went through in the earlier stages of its development. The concepts and idioms formulated by Ptolemy (certainly misunderstood as the voice of Thomas) influenced the development of Euro pean republicanism in the pre-modern era.64 As an important moment in the making of later medieval and early modern republicanism, Ptolemy's theory of government should be further studied. Nevertheless, it would not mean seeing Ptolemy as a pioneer of civic republicanism inspired by the Aristote lian political view as has previously been the case.
