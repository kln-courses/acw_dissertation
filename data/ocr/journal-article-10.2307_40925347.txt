<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN BESTIALITY SEX, ANIMALS, AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUBJECTIVITY V^n March 21, 2006, a dog handler was convicted of charges brought against him in conjunction with the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib detention facility in Iraq. Army Sgt. Michael J. Smith, aged twenty-four, was found guilty of six out of thirteen indictments. Smith expressed remorse for only one of those convictions, his con- viction for indecency. That conviction stemmed from Smith's "direct- ing his dog to lick peanut butter off the genitals of a male soldier and the breasts of a female soldier." Smith said: "It was foolish, stupid and juvenile. There is nothing I could do to take it back. If I could, I would" (Dishneau 2006a). Smith expressed remorse for having his dog engage in sexual acts with his fellow soldiers. What made this one charge among the many for which he was convicted legible to Smith as an offense? Smith apologized for the one act that involved other Ameri- cans, and for an offense that situates his case within a practice that is foundational of the social order itself, that is, the practice of construct- ing subjectivity by criminalizing bestiality. His reference to his acts as "juvenile" marks them as a rite-of-passage into adult maturity; his apology itself performs a learning process by which he comes to rec- ognize subjects (those fellow beings who have legal standing in the courts and interpersonal recognition from acts such as apologies) by distinguishing them from animals (those nonsubjects that lack legal and discursive representation). There is no mention here of the Iraqi detainees, or of the dog. My pointing out that second absence will in and of itself seem ludi- crous, and my linking the dog with the detainees might come across as offensive: of course Smith didn't apologize to the dog. After all, we reserve rights and apologies exclusively for human beings, because only they participate as subjects in the structural and representational Cultural Critique 76- Fall 2010- Copyright 2010 Regents of the University of Minnesota</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 99 schemes that make up the symbolic order. Representational subjec- tivity sets human beings apart from all other living creatures - it lies at the core of our secular notion that human beings are special, that there is such a thing as human exceptionalism. I borrow the term "human exceptionalism" from Kay Anderson, who uses the phrase to describe the belief that each human being is fundamentally different from all animals (426). That belief has its strategic purposes in allowing us to conceptualize human rights as a category of legal, ethical, and sym- bolic representation that extends subjectivity beyond state boundaries. But I worry that human exceptionalism actually enables abuses be- cause it sets up a dichotomy between human beings who have repre- sentational subjectivity and animals who lack it. Smith's apology exemplifies this problem. He defines representational subjectivity onto- logically and tautologically: one has rights by virtue of being human, and one is human by virtue of having rights. By that definition, ani- mals lack rights because they are animals, but all too easily, those who lack rights, such as the abused detainees, are animalized. Human and animal are categories that lay claim to utter ontological fixity but are highly fungible. Any creature who is not deemed human becomes sub- ject to abuse without recourse to ethical standards that would mark such injury as a wrong: Smith never apologized to the detainees he brutalized; like the dog, they remained to him nonsubjects, beyond recognition. Ultimately, human exceptionalism does not protect human beings from abjection, but it enables abuse by creating animality as a posi- tion of nonsubjectivity and of socially sanctioned abjection. Abjec- tion takes on many forms, but one thing "interlocking oppressions" such as racism, sexism, and homophobia have in common is that their mechanisms of shame and violence revolve around literal and figu- rative animals.1 The abjection of animals is the sine qua non of these forms of domination (Adams and Donovan, 9). That abject animality is not simply outside of the legal order; it is foundational to it. Giorgio Agamben (1998) made a similar argument by reexamining Michel Foucault's notion of biopower as a key mech- anism of sovereignty in the state of exception. Agamben has demon- strated how the abject position of a "bare life" that stands outside religious and social law, and which he identifies with the role of the homo sacer, is the disavowed origin for the equally unlawful position</page><page sequence="3">100 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS of the sovereign. Useful as I find Agamben's account of this nonsub- ject who can be put to death without violating human or divine law, it overlooks the fact that in cases of bestiality, animals historically became subject to the law that put them to death.2 Bestiality then pro- vides an instance in which the homo sacer and the sovereign directly encounter one another. In that encounter, we see suspended the dif- ferentiation between subjects and nonsubjects that underlies the sym- bolic order and its concomitant forms of representation. Bestiality marks a moment, I will argue, where symbolic representation is both suspended and emergent, where the metaphoric and the metamorphic conjoin and become differentiated, where the categories of the human subject and the animal abject come into play. Agamben provides little by way of allowing us to imagine that encounter because his theoreti- cal apparatus has no notion of affect, either psychological or physical, and of its ability to function as a mode of recognition that is different from symbolic representation. The trope of bestiality raises questions about the figurability of tropes, and the representation of violence in the form of animalization and bestialization offers a glimpse into the nature of violence as such. Identifying the abjection of embodied animality as the origin of mod- ern subjectivity, I argue that rethinking the body as a discursive and intersubjective site enables us to understand and critique the mecha- nisms of violence. I further develop the lead of critics who have chal- lenged our understanding of subjectivity by defining it as a shared, not an isolated quality. Taking issue with the ideological gesture that "casts emotion as proof of the human subject/' Rei Terada, for instance, exam- ines instead the "common ground of the physiological and the psy- chological," and argues that "emotions emerge only through acts of interpretation and identification by means of which we feel for others" (Terada, 4, 21). In taking up the relationship between human beings and animals, my work tests the boundaries of who or what can count as an "other" that we feel "for," and what forms such "feeling" takes in the context of bestiality. What both discourses neglect to develop is an understanding of the specifically gendered and sexual constructions that occur via bes- tiality. Taking for one of my key premises the claim that subjectivity is founded on a series of related disavowals - of race, gender, and species - I focus on the specific work that the ordering of hierarchies</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 101 does, and the extent to which it is compatible with a biopolitics of "othering." Bestiality and its criminalization offer a model for the emergence of human subjectivity. I understand bestiality through its historical definition as the performance of human-animal sexual rela- tions and in its broader use as a synonym for any act of sodomy. In this discussion, bestiality signifies as a mode of embodied animality, that is, of human interaction with the animal body and an animaliza- tion of human bodies. Taking seriously the commentators who have linked the abuses at Abu Ghraib with white hegemony (Patricia Williams) and have read the photos as replicating the representational logic of dominatrix images (Susan Sontag), I trace an arc from William Bradford's Ply- mouth Plantation to current detention practices in order to understand the abjection of animalized nonsubjectivity on which the systemic production of human subjectivity hinges. At stake in the conjunction I draw between historically disparate textual and visual examples is the operation by which animal representations produce states of being and beings in the state. THE DISAVOWED ORIGINS OF SUBJECTIVITY: BESTIALITY In Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647, one of the American ur-texts, William Bradford describes the trial of sixteen-year-old Thomas Granger. Accused of a "horrible case of bestiality/' Granger was con- victed of having had sexual intercourse with a mare, a cow, two goats, five sheep, two calves, and a turkey (Bradford, 355). Following the punishment for such offenses dictated by Leviticus 20:15, the animals were put to death in front of Granger, before he himself was executed. Considering the animal carcasses to be unclean, the settlers destroyed them without using the meat or skins they could have yielded. Elab- orating on the reasons for this harsh punishment, Samuel Danforth explained a few years later in The cry of Sodom enquired into (1674): Bestiality, or Buggery, [occur] when any prostitute themselves to a Beast. This is an accursed thing ... it turneth a man into a bruit Beast. He that joyneth himself to a Beast, is one flesh with a Beast. . . . This horrid wickedness pollutes the very Beast, and makes it more unclean and beastly than it was, and unworthy to live amongst Beasts, and therefore</page><page sequence="5">102 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS the Lord to show his detestation of such Vilany, hath appointed the Beast it self to be slain. (5)3 By his acts of bestiality, Granger had abdicated his standing as a human being. Having "prostitute[d]" himself by physically becoming "one flesh with a Beast/' his sexual relationship to animals also cor- rupted his soul with "horrid wickedness" and turned him from a human being "into a bruit Beast." The language escalates into the hys- terical - the beast verbally proliferates and becomes "more unclean and beastly than it was"; its degree of beastliness increases. This notion that beastliness is not an absolute but has varying degrees reflects a deep uneasiness about the distinction between human beings and animals. By criminalizing a crossing of the species barrier, the law tries to establish and naturalize ontological categories that it simulta- neously reveals to be highly unstable. Human subjectivity emerges via the criminalization of bestiality. Bradford's and Danforth's accounts reflect that the law does not simply apply to a subject that exists a priori; it constructs the human- ity of that subject (or his lack thereof). By demanding that human beings ought not to engage in sexual acts with animals, the law regu- lates the boundary between human beings and animals. This act of prohibition simultaneously defines the difference between human beings and animals as absolute and yet fungible. While it maintains that human beings and animals are absolutely different from one another and therefore ought not copulate, it acknowledges that such copulation occurs. Sex itself takes on the power to be ontologically transformative: it moves Granger from the category of the human to that of the animal. That transformation occurs via Granger's relation- ship to the law. By engaging in a sexual encounter with an animal, he forfeits his rights and the law's protections; he inhabits the same rela- tion to the law as animals, and suffers the same death as they. Exempt from legal subjectivity, animals are nevertheless subject to the law's punitive reach. That punitive reach defines those condemned to death by law as animals: animals function as a category of legal death from which the law temporarily and conditionally exempts human beings. Granger witnessed the death of the animals with whom he had had intercourse as a métonymie act in which his own execution was in- scribed. In losing his legal subjectivity, his right to life and liberty,</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 103 Granger becomes subject to the law, victim to its punitive powers, and inhabits the position of abject animality from which the law tem- porarily exempts those whom it grants legal subjectivity. This legal mechanism then reveals bestiality to be an underlying structure for social formation and regulation. Alphonso Lingis and Midas Dekkers have argued for the per- vasiveness of bestiality, by insisting that it underlies all acts of love: in making love even to a fellow human, we are always encountering an animal or animalized other (Lingis, 46; see also Dekkers). Useful as their arguments may be for allowing us to reflect on the alterity of love, they don't help us to see the power differential at play in acts of bestiality, nor do they enable us to understand fully the complex lit- eral and symbolic meanings of this social foundation. As Danforth's use of bestiality and buggery as synonyms indi- cates, the legal standing of a man depends on his compliance with mandated sexual practices. In Totem and Taboo (1913) Sigmund Freud links bestiality and incest to explain the disavowed foundations of heteronormative patriarchy. On the surface, the prohibition against bestiality and against incest may seem to follow diametrically opposed logics - one being a prohibition against straying too far from the range of sexually acceptable partners, the other a warning against not stray- ing far enough. Certainly, critical discourse dating back to Aquinas has argued for and upheld such distinctions and mapped the two into differential relationship with each other (Davidson, 42). However, Freud departs from this line of interpretation. Arguing that a totem is "as a rule an animal" which "is the common ancestor of the clan," he points to an act of cross-species miscegenation that inaugurates human social formation (2). Freud asks: "How . . . did ['primitive' men] come to make the fact of their being descended from one animal or another the basis of their social obligations and, as we shall see presently, of their sexual restrictions?" (3 n.2). Observing that "almost every place where we find totems we also find a law against persons of the same totem having sexual relations with one another and consequently against their marrying," Freud speculates that "the most ancient and important taboo prohibitions are the two basic laws of totemism: not to kill the totem animal and to avoid sexual intercourse with mem- bers of the totem clan of the opposite sex. These, then, must be the oldest and most powerful of human desires" (31-32). Freud further</page><page sequence="7">104 I COLLEEN GLENNEY B0G6S explores this conjunction between the desire to kill the totem animal and to have intercourse with members of the totem clan: seemingly digressing into a discussion of children's animal phobias (a topic that also preoccupied him elsewhere, for instance in the case of the "Wolf- Man" that he documented in a History of Infantile Neurosis), he con- cludes that they "displace some of their feelings [of fear] from their father on to an animal" (129). The payoff of this analysis for Freud lies in his comparison between children and "primitive" men, which enables him to suggest that "the totem animal is in reality a substi- tute for the father" (140-41). Freud explains early social formation as contingent on the figure of the animal and its ability to regulate het- eronormative social relations; the totem animal both predates and originates the formation of the social and symbolic order. The subjectivity that is being negotiated in trials of bestiality is then directly tied to what Judith Butler has called the "heterosexual matrix," which she also refers to as the "matrix of gender" and the "matrix of power" (1993, 27). Butler argues that compulsory hetero- sexuality defines who counts as a subject. At stake is not just the "strate- gic aim of maintaining gender within its binary frame," but that aim itself serves to "found and consolidate the subject" (1999, 179). As concerned as she is about the effects these mechanics of power have on subject formation, Butler ultimately shares with the order she cri- tiques an assumption that subjectivity is always already human. Tak- ing Butler's argument a step further by challenging that assumption, we can recognize that the subject produced by compulsory hetero- sexuality under the rules of patriarchy is doubly man and mankind - there is a dual operation here of androcentrism and anthropocentrism: at the site of bestiality, the discourse of species and the construction of gender conjoin to create a notion of subjectivity that mandates physical behavior for the construction of the human. Butler (1997) has described physical behavior not just in terms of normative heterosexuality, but also in terms of gender performance, that is, as the daily acts through which we conform to social expecta- tions of how our bodies ought to signify. Useful as her argument is for de-ontologizing gender, it runs the risk of re-ontologizing species, in that it is implicitly humans and humans only who perform gender and participate in this social construct. The exclusion of animals from the matrix of gender relegates them to a realm of nonperformative</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 105 embodiment that is hypersexualized precisely because it is denied gen- dered status and figured as nonrepresentational physicality. Barred from participating in the social construction and figuration of gender, animals - and those who are animalized - are relegated to a position of what I will call bare sex, that is, a position of hyper-embodiment that is denied social meaning. But how can we understand the bare sex of animalized life if by definition it is removed from the symbolic order? To address that question, I turn to an overview of the current shift in "animal studies" from a preoccupation with animal rights - that is, with the law that regulates subjectivity - to "animal rites" - that is, performances of subjectivity that focus especially on the inter- action between different species. FROM ANIMAL RIGHTS TO ANIMAL RITES: AN OVERVIEW The question whether and how states of being are conjoined with ways of being in the state inaugurated and shaped a still developing field of social activism and academic inquiry. The modern animal rights movement and the intellectual enterprise of animal studies emerged from Peter Singer's engagement with a key passage in Jeremy Ben- tham's writing that challenged the kind of theocratic law practiced at Plymouth Plantation, a passage that I am interested in for the light it sheds on how we might rethink the representational registers of subjectivity. In his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (1789), Bentham worried that The day has been, I grieve to say in many places it is not yet past, in which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of slaves, have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing, as, in England for example, the inferior races of animals are still. The day may come, when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the</page><page sequence="9">106 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversible animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not, Can they reason? Nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suf- fer? (283) Calling for nothing short of a revolution through his references to the recent French overthrow of "tyranny/7 Bentham envisions a Utopian state in which the wrongful withholding of rights from animals will be redressed. Bentham challenged Christian theologians' belief in a great chain of being that justified the submission of "animal creation" to abusive practices of dominion on the basis of a hierarchical distinc- tion between "inferior races" and superior species. He also rejected rationalist philosophers' notion that human beings and animals were fundamentally different from one another, and that an absolute "fac- ulty of reason" and "faculty of discourse" separated all human beings from all animals; Bentham pointed out that some animals were "more rational" and "more conversible" than some human beings. Recogniz- ing that such comparative terms still placed animals and those likened to them at a disadvantage, he redefined the very grounds of rights- bearing when he argued that subjectivity could be located in feeling, that is, in the physical capacity to suffer.4 Pitting participation in the symbolic order (the capacity to talk) against an embodied experience (the ability to suffer), Bentham calls to our attention the power that figuration has to create a nonfigurative category of abjection into which the physically "other" can be lumped. He insists that the body itself has legibility and meaning in excess of the symbolic order. Peter Singer self-consciously modeled his call for Animal Libera- tion (1975) on Bentham's claims, and specifically styled his work as the next step in the struggle for racial, gender, and now species equal- ity. Grounding his appeal for animal liberation in the belief that sub- jectivity and responsibility emerge where there is actual or possible suffering, Singer argued that the interests of human beings do not necessarily outweigh those of animals, and that both need to be mea- sured against the greater good. Yet this focus on suffering as the marker for ethical consideration risks subscribing to the kind of essentialism Singer hoped to abolish. By using suffering as a measure for legal and ethical subjectivity, Singer locates ethics in naturalism: as Cary Wolfe</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 107 has pointed out, Singer anchors "the contingency of the social contract" on "noncontingent natural ground" (39). To avoid replicating the essentialism that animal studies sets out to critique but risks repeating, Wolfe insists that we shift our attention from animal rights to what he calls "animal rites." Taking humanism for a starting point, he argues that we need to expand our categories for subjectivity and rights-bearing across species boundaries when certain criteria are met: "when our generally agreed-on markers for ethical consideration are observed in species other than Homo Sapiens, we are obliged to take them into account equally and to respect them accordingly" (42). This approach hopes to deconstruct the humanism from which it departs, without resorting to essentialist categories. But as always, the devil is in the details. A growing body of work especially in the social sciences has ques- tioned essentialist readings of animals and examined the extent to which the encounter between human beings and animals shapes both.5 Approaching animals from a constructionist viewpoint, historians Harriet Ritvo and Keith Thomas have documented how seemingly stable categories such as animal breeds emerged at specific historical moments and reflected the changing relationships between human and nonhuman animals (Ritvo 1985, 1987, 1991, 1994; Thomas). Inscrib- ing animals not only within history but also within a history of sexu- ality,6 feminist scholars such as Carol Adams have argued that the construction of the embodiment of women and of animals mirror one another in that patriarchal Western society consistently abjects both (Adams and Donovan). Pointing out that animals consumed for food disappear "both literally and figuratively" from cultural conscious- ness, Adams argues that women's sexualized bodies all too often stand in for the "absent [animal] referent" (Adams 1994, 17). Opening positions of animality to discourse analysis, Adams argues that the boundary between human beings and animals is not stable, and points to the gendering of that instability: she demonstrates that sexual dif- ference and species distinctions are the disavowed sites where patri- archy asserts the dominance of men and mankind while denying the claims of women and animals. Whereas Adams's feminist approach overlooks the homoerotics of animal abjection and runs the risk of reinstating the gender bina- ries she sets out to critique, Donna Haraway draws from postcolonial</page><page sequence="11">108 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS studies an interest in hybridity that she mobilizes to rethink sub- jectivity as queerly blended. In "A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s" (1985) and The Com- panion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness (2003), Haraway argues that postmodernity has given rise to subjectivities that stretch across technical and species barriers. Rejecting ontologi- cal claims, she insists that we need to understand subjectivity as a relational category that emerges in the interaction between human beings and companion animals such as dogs. Eroding the very ground for human exceptionalism, Haraway argues that dogs are not about oneself. . . . They are not a projection, nor the realiza- tion of an intention, nor the telos of anything. They are dogs; i.e., a species in obligatory, constitutive, historical, protean relationship with human beings . . . dogs are about the inescapable, contradictory story of relation- ships - co-constitutive relationships in which none of the partners pre- exist the relating, and the relating is never done once and for all. (2003, 12) Haraway shifts our attention from notions of individual subjectivity as an a priori given to an understanding of subjectivity as a relational category that emerges in the encounter between different beings. Try- ing to replace the violent abuses of bestiality with mutually affirma- tive "acts of love," Haraway imagines a subjectivity that emerges from and generates an ever widening social fabric, a global politics based on affect: she argues that "acts of love like training in Vicki Hear ne' s sense breed acts of love like caring about and for other concatenated, emergent worlds. That is the core of my companion species manifesto" (2003, 61). The reference to Hearne bears explication because her work ex- emplifies the pitfalls of rethinking the body as a site of alternative representation and subject formation, in local and global contexts. Abandoning the Benthamite concern with suffering, Hearne inscribes animals in a Jeffersonian model of happiness. Arguing that working animals are engaged in a pursuit of happiness, she resorts to an essen- tialist claim that their desire to labor comes from "something within the animal" that she defines in "Aristotelian terms, not as a synonym for pleasure or antonym of suffering but as something associated with ethics" (1991, 60). In her seminal work as an animal trainer and writer, Hearne identified training as a process by which animals and human</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 109 beings develop a joint "language" that confers "mutual autonomy and trust" (1987, 34). Appealing as her description may sound, the path she describes for achieving that autonomy is disturbingly paternalis- tic: exonerating anthropomorphism, her work becomes patronizing and (posthumously) downright imperialist when she appropriates the comparison between human beings and animals to insist that "we don't imagine we can grant civil rights to human beings without first assum- ing authority over them as teachers, parents and friends, but we have lately supposed, strangely, that rights can be granted to animals with- out our first occupying the ground of commitment that training them instances" (1987, 49). In writing about companion animals, Hearne creates a notion of intersubjectivity that is highly hierarchical and that makes pedagogy itself complicit with authoritarianism. Perhaps ped- agogy can never be entirely devoid of power hierarchies, but Hearne's notion of "mutual autonomy and trust" includes only animals com- panionable to human beings; it inscribes certain animals within the humanistic fold, and justifies the exclusion of other animals on the very basis of the animal rites she advocates. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have taken issue with the sen- timental investment that people have in "individuated animals," and especially pets, claiming that they take on an "Oedipal" status and are the subject of "narcissistic contemplation" (89-90). Haraway tries to redress these problems by insisting that love is about alterity. Con- ceived in that way, love for an animal can become the prototype for loving others as others. Loving others calls into question one's own subjectivity precisely because we are never sure if that love will be reciprocated. Loving an animal is the ultimate kind of such other-love because it opens us up to the alterity of the other and the possibility that the reciprocity we hope for will not follow. Such love is not the expression of a self-replicating or self-sustaining emotion, but quite the contrary, it makes emotion the very hallmark of posthumanist sub- jectivity. It is in the loving encounter with animals that the possibility for a subjectivity emerges that is deeply relational and nonviolent. Compelling as I find Haraway' s argument, I worry about three things. One, her notion of "love" already seems to depend on an ide- alization of emotion as the antidote to violence, an idealization that alternative practices of "love," such as bestiality, call into question. Second, her identification of companion species relies on a literalism</page><page sequence="13">110 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS by which a dog is always a dog. Yet from its inception in Bentham's writing, animal studies has recognized the fact that animality (just like humanity) is first and foremost a figurative relation to the sym- bolic order. Third, I worry about the pastoral strain that runs through Haraway's manifesto, and about the positions of exclusion that the companion species relationship creates. Focusing on the relationship between shepherds and sheep dogs, we can indeed see the symbiosis between companion species at work, as it finds expression in emotional and discursive registers. But what about the similarly symbiotic rela- tionship between a soldier and a guard dog? As I demonstrate by revisiting Smith's case, the bond between the dog and the soldier becomes the very grounds of aggression against abjected others; the symbiotic relationship between the soldier and the guard dog creates a third position, that of the detainee who is relegated to a position of pure animality that is excluded from legal and ethical consideration, from human rights and animal rites. Yet as a hermeneutic, the model created by "animal studies'7 might be useful for providing us with the tools for reading precisely those dynamics of exclusion, and might enable us to reveal the way in which mechanisms of violence rely on figurations of abject animality. It is with this purpose in mind that I now turn to two images from Abu Ghraib. THE DOG IN THE PICTURE: ANIMALITY AND REPRESENTATION AT ABU GHRAIB The images out of Abu Ghraib become legible in a new way when we think about them in relation to bestiality, on which they trope inces- santly, and they teach us something about the different representa- tional devices at play in depictions of animals and animality. In one image (figure 1), we see Lynndie England, in U.S. Army fatigues, hold- ing an Iraqi prisoner on a dog leash.7 The photo establishes a visual hierarchy: the soldier stands looking down on the detainee, whose face is on the level of her combat boots. Stripped naked, he is rele- gated to a hypersexualized position of nonrepresentational physical- ity, that is, he is reduced to bare sex. The dog leash establishes his animalized position, but also functions as an instrument of control,</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 111 wielded by England, within a disciplinary regime that exercises (ille- gality via punishments and abjection. While Susan Sontag has argued that "a young woman leading a naked man around on a leash is clas- sic dominatrix imagery," there seems to be more at stake here than the reaffirmation of traditional gender roles via their imaginative rever- sal. I find Lynndie England's position in this image downright illegi- ble: she is ambiguously gendered, she seems to be actively giving and passively following orders, she seems to be asserting her subjectivity by enacting a ritual of bestiality that will make her subject to the law from which she seems temporarily to remove herself. The difficulties of reading this image stem from the stakes of this encounter: the image is working out the differentiations between sub- jects and nonsubjects that underlie the symbolic order and its con- comitant forms of representation. Bestiality marks a moment where symbolic representation is both inoperative and emergent, where the metaphoric and the literal conjoin and become differentiated. In that sense, this picture is both illegible and overdetermined: we can read this image as a simile (the detainee is like a dog) or as a metaphor Figure 1. Lynndie England holding Iraqi detainee on dog leash at Abu Ghraib prison.</page><page sequence="15">112 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS (England has leashed a dog). For that matter, this image could stand in for the definition of metaphor that The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms provides: The most important and widespread figure of speech, in which one thing, idea, or action is referred to by a word or expression normally denoting another thing, idea, or action, so as to suggest some common quality shared by the two. In metaphor, this resemblance is assumed as an imag- inary identity rather than directly stated as a comparison: referring to a man as that pig, or saying he is a pig is metaphorical, whereas he is like a pig is a simile.8 The torture depicted in this image from Abu Ghraib captures the very definition of metaphor: using the visual iconography of the leash to suggest a common quality between the detainee and a dog, this stated resemblance inaugurates an imaginary identity between the objects of comparison. But we know that metaphor also doubles back on itself, via a pro- cess Henry Louis Gates has identified as signifyin' (Gates). We perform such an act of reversal by reading these images as acts of "brutality," that is, by judging the soldiers and not their victims as "brutes." Trop- ing on tropes reassigns the attributions of metaphor, but I worry that such metadiscursive distancing nevertheless perpetuates their deni- grating violence. Akira Lippit' s work is useful in this regard: through a reading of Freud's dreamwork, Lippit locates "a kind of originary topography shared by human beings and animals," in which "the ani- mal becomes intertwined with the trope, serving as its vehicle and substance" (1112). Lippit coins the term "animetaphor" to describe the animal as both "an exemplary metaphor" and an "originary meta- phor," and argues that animals function "as the unconscious of lan- guage, of logos" (1113). Following Jacques Derrida, Lippit argues that logos "is engendered by a zoon, and can never entirely efface the traces of its origin. The genealogy of language . . . returns to a place outside of logos. The animal brings to language something that is not a part of language and remains within language as a foreign presence" (1113). The animal thus takes on the role of "a vital metaphor, that enters the world from a place outside of language," a "figure that is metamor- phic rather than metaphoric" (1117-18). Jonathan Elmer and Cary Wolfe have mapped out the complex subject positions that emerge in this play between the metamorphic</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 113 and the metaphoric. Tracing a "species grid/' they identify four posi- tions in the relationship between animals and human beings (Wolfe and Elmer, 100). The four positions they name are: the animalized animal, the humanized human, the humanized animal, and the ani- malized human. The animalized animal is denied any subjectivity, any protection from suffering, "it" (not he or she) is abjected, exploited, abused, destroyed. As Granger's case demonstrates, that animalized animal's noncriminal putting to death is not only sanctioned by but requisite for the legal system: it divides the permissible violence against nonsubjects from the nonpermissible violence against subjects (Der- rida 1991, 112). The counterpoint to the animalized animal is the humanized human, a being who defines his humanity via his ability to exert total domination over the animalized animal, and who achieves humanity by acts of brutality and destruction. Although the human- ized human negates the importance of the animalized animal, that negation establishes his identity. At the very moment of differentiation a relationship exists: human and animal identities depend on one another, and the humanized human's brutality metaphorically likens him to the violence and lack of subjectivity he attributes to the brute, the animalized animal. The metamorphic violence of these associa- tions becomes evident in the use to which metaphor is put in creating the two remaining subject positions, the position of the animalized human and the humanized animal. The use of metaphor to liken a human being to an animal creates the position of the animalized human who is treated to the same kind of abject suffering as the animalized animal. To see the species grid in play and to understand the representa- tional violence it enacts, I turn to a photo (figure 2) that captured some of the abuses committed by Army Sgt. Michael J. Smith, with whom I began this essay. If we follow the picture's horizontal line, the soldier and the detainee frame the dog, who stands between them. He literally occupies the position that Eve Sedgwick has taught us to read as the homosocial relationship "between men." This image enacts the primal scene of patriarchal discipline, bestiality. The dog in this image mediates homosocial longing but fails to transform it into heterosex- ual union. Positioned between the soldier's legs, the dog becomes both the object of anal penetration and an extension of the soldier's own</page><page sequence="17">114 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS phallus. The photo stages a performance of masculinity and of sexu- ality that is extremely exhibitionistic. Yet these extremities become difficult to read: while the soldier directs homosexual longing toward the detainee by turning the dog into a phallic extension that is directed at the object of desire, the detainee is also excluded from the bond of bestiality between the soldier and the dog. The dog simultaneously functions as a mediator, through whom homosocial longing is relayed to the detainee, and as himself the object of the soldier's desire, to which the detainee is either a witness or incidental. This second read- ing, by which we see this picture as an act of bestiality perpetrated by the soldier himself, is further born out if we remember the one act for which Smith apologized, and that was the use of his guard dog for performing sexual acts on fellow American soldiers. The use of the animal for those acts negates the patriarchal order it is meant to estab- lish, in that it performs the acts banished from the social order and from its concomitant mechanisms of legality and subjectivity. Smith's standing depends on a careful orchestration of positions on the species grid. Smith assumes the place of the humanized human in his domination of the guard dog and the detainee; he looms over them, while they inhabit the same lowly level in this image's spatial hierarchy. In his role as the humanized human, Smith dominates the humanized animal, the dog Marco, and the animalized human, the Iraqi detainee whose name, to the best of my knowledge, is not listed on any of the English Web sites that discuss this picture. That ano- nymity, the lack of a name, is itself indicative of the abjection enacted here, which places the detainee outside of the symbolic order. The detainee is confronted by both the dog and the soldier - by compan- ion species at work, in Donna Haraway's terminology. That encounter with companion species places him in the position of the animalized Figure 2. Army Sgt. Michael J. Smith baiting guard dog Marco to frighten Iraqi detainee into defecating.</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 115 animal: excluded from human-animal bonds, he figures metaphori- cally and physically as the other other. The violence of that abjection becomes even clearer if we place the image in its context. Smith and another dog handler, Santos A. Cardona who was tried and convicted on June 2, 2006, had engaged in a contest. Prisoners had urinated on themselves when confronted with dogs. The two dog handlers then used their unmuzzled dogs to see if they could frighten the prisoners into defecating (Dishneau 2006b). In the photo, Smith is trying to elicit an anal response from the prisoner. The Iraqi detainee is relegated to the position of the nonverbal, the purely and utterly physical; the sol- dier is literally trying to turn the detainee into shit. This image produces the detainee as the excess of the patriarchal order. Cynically exploiting the widely held Sunni and Shi' a Muslim attitude toward dogs as unclean animals, the very construction of the dog as a companion species already speaks to a particular cultural position; it simultaneously tries to capitalize on and to disregard other cultural attitudes toward dogs. In confronting the detainee with an unclean animal, it enforces a sense of utter abjection - the detainee is being made unclean in coming into contact with the unclean animal. At the same time, that contamination of contact also ricochets, and makes visible the uncleanness of the soldiers who associate with dogs. The image then opens up fissures in which the mechanisms of patri- archal authority become legible; but what would it mean to extend that legibility to the figures of abjection, to the animal and the ani- malized themselves? FACE TO FACE WITH ANIMALS The dog's presence in this picture facilitates the detainee's removal from the symbolic order and its concomitant forms of legal, social, and verbal subjectivity. It also opens the possibility for a different kind of representational regime to arise. The position of the human- ized animal, like the position of the animalized human, is precarious. In the military's scheme of valuation, military working dogs (MWDs) are animate objects that attain temporary fetish-status, but are de- stroyed when they lose their use value, that is, their ability to regulate and mediate the violence of disciplinary regimes.9 In this scene, the dog</page><page sequence="19">116 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS Marco is serving the disciplinary regime by doing the work of inter- pellation that Louis Althusser associates with the operation of "Ide- ology and Ideological State Apparatuses" (162-70). Althusser argues that the ideological state apparatus functions by interpellating sub- jects. The example he gives for the way interpellation works is hailing: if somebody calls in the street, each person feels addressed and turns around - each person is interpellated as the specific subject whom the authoritative call addresses. But what happens when the prisoner is interpellated by the dog's growling or barking? What happens when the response this interpellation is meant to elicit is physical, bodily, visceral, anal? When the interpellation does not turn the prisoner into an accused, but into a detainee who will be held indefinitely without charges or due process? Is he interpellated as a subject? Can he be interpellated as a nonsubject? The interpellation by a guard dog seems to undercut the very premises of interpellation in that it unhinges subjectivity from symbolic representation. Through the mirrorings that occur in this scene, we can in fact imagine a different kind of subjectivity and representation that is premised on the bodily alterity of the other. In his groundbreaking work on subjectivity, Jacques Lacan exempted animals from the mir- ror scene. He argued that the infant primate quickly loses interest in his mirror image. For the human child, that image becomes the site of fragmentation and loss that forms the basis for his subject formation and his social formation (Lacan, 1-7). The image of Smith multiplies the scene of mirroring: not only are the soldier and the prisoner mir- roring one another, but the prisoner and the dog are also mirroring one another. It is that second mirroring for which Lacan cannot account, which disrupts the symbolic order and allows us to think beyond it, or at least to exploit the fissures within it as sites of critique. Jacques Derrida's final publications before his death on "the auto- biographical animal" located animals at the disavowed core of subject formation. Promising that he would speak frankly, that is, speak of naked truths in conceptualizing the modern subject, he arrived via a series of puns at a point where he imagined what it would mean to appear naked in front of a cat, who "has its point of view regarding me. The point of view of the absolute other; and nothing will have ever done more to make me think through this absolute alterity of the neighbor than these moments when I see myself seen naked under</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 117 the gaze of a cat" (Derrida 2002, 379-80).10 Mapping the cat's gaze onto the very history of subjectivity that denies the cat a gaze yet locates the origins of representational subjectivity in the disavowed site of bestiality, Derrida inscribes animals within an autobiographi- cal mode of writing that founds and confounds the parameters of representational subjectivity by rewriting the mirror scene as an en- counter in which the animal reflects and refracts the human subject. Seeing the cat's gaze, Derrida discovers his naked sex. That naked sex is a social construct in that it emerges in his relationship with the ani- mal. As the foundational site for the construction of sexual identity, the cat's gaze collapses the distinction between sex and gender, and inscribes both in the relationship between human beings and animals. What Derrida allows us to understand is that the very distinction between the signifier and the signified breaks down and emerges in this third space, as a tertium quid that forever defies definition, but in which we can practice violent abjection or nonviolent recognition. The former generates the kinds of abuses we see in the photos from Abu Ghraib; the latter makes those abuses impossible. Whereas Derrida stages the encounter with his cat in the privacy of his bathroom, Emanuel Levinas provides an account that I want to read as countering the scenes from Abu Ghraib. In one of the oddest and most complex accounts he published, "The Name of a Dog, or Natural Rights" (1975), Levinas deconstructs Western attitudes toward animal- ity when he describes his experience in a Nazi detention camp. Lev- inas and his fellow Jewish detainees found themselves in the position of animalized humans whose treatment at the hands of their captors "stripped us of our human skin" and placed them in a "subhuman" position (1990, 153). Despite the "small inner murmur" that kept affirming their "essence as thinking creatures," they found themselves "no longer part of the world" (1990, 153). Levinas's wording here in- vokes and challenges Martin Heidegger's argument that "the animal is poor in world" whereas "man is world-forming" (177). Rejecting such ontological difference, or to be more precise, such different relations to ontology, Levinas indicates that the distinction between human beings and animals is not absolute but relational, that their position in regard to the world is not ontological but situational. Describing himself and his fellow detainees as "beings entrapped in their species; despite all their vocabulary, beings without language,"</page><page sequence="21">118 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS Levinas explores the implications of that realization by examining the parameters of intelligibility (1990, 153). Although David Clark reads Levinas as ultimately subscribing to the notion that linguistic capac- ity separates human beings from animals, and that only the human subject can bear proper witness (197), the distinction Levinas draws between vocabulary and language bears further investigation. Map- ping Ferdinand de Saussure's differentiation between parole and langue onto the prisoners and guards, respectively, Levinas indicates that he and his fellow detainees were capable of individual expres- sion but were barred from having that expression signify in the struc- tural contexts they inhabited. Expanding on this point, he writes that "Racism is not a biological concept; anti-Semitism is the archetype of all internment. Social aggression, itself, merely imitates this model. It shuts people away in a class, deprives them of expression and con- demns them to being 'signifiers without a signified' and from there to violence and fighting" (1990, 153). Arguing that racism's ontology is discursively constructed, Levinas demonstrates that metaphor (the use of archetypal referents) creates metamorphic positions. Instead of language being an absolute human capacity, Levinas argues that it is possible for human beings to be deprived "of expression," and rele- gated to a position of nonsignification. That position of nonsignifica- tion places the detainee in the literal position of animality, where he meets with "violence." Levinas does not merely document that violence but also posits an alternative model of communication. If Levinas himself did not have any experience with German guard dogs, surely he was aware by the time of his writing in 1975 of their use in detention camps. Yet Levinas invokes the dog in a different capacity, as a creature that does not do the bidding of state interpellation and violence, but that performs a different kind of subject formation by giving the body itself a discur- sive register with which to critique the model of abjection practiced by the Nazis. Levinas describes the detainees' encounter with a dog they named Bobby, who visited the camp: "He would appear at morning assembly and was waiting for us as we returned, jumping up and down and barking in delight. For him, there was no doubt that we were men." Introducing a dog early in his piece as "someone who disrupts society's games (or Society itself)," Levinas finds his subjectivity</page><page sequence="22">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 119 affirmed - or rather newly constructed - in the encounter with Bobby (1990, 151). While the prisoners endure forced labor, their relation- ship to Bobby occurs outside the camp's structures of domination, and beyond the working relationship Hearne and Haraway associate with companion species. In the casual and friendly encounter with the ani- mal, Levinas experiences humane ways of being in the world. Indeed, we see here a difference between dogs such as Marco, who are com- panions to guards, and Bobby, who becomes a companion to men with- out entering into a fixed relationship of discipline or pedagogy. However, this figure also seems to reinscribe some of the central notions of subjectivity: as a free agent, the dog seems to occupy the position of the humanized animal in the species grid, and through his acts of seeming volition to reaffirm the humanity of the animalized human. It is not clear that the animal is able to function here in a role as an animal other. Developing as his basic philosophical premise the notion that the face-to-face encounter with the other makes the human human, Lev- inas struggled with the question whether animals could be included in his model of relational, ethical subjectivity. In an interview he gave in 1986, he responded directly to the question of whether animals have a face. Affirming that "one cannot entirely refuse the face of an ani- mal" (2004, 49), he ambiguously argued that his "entire philosophy" hinged on the idea that for human beings "there is something more important than my life, and that is the life of the other. That is unrea- sonable. Man is an unreasonable animal" (2004, 50). At the very moment of differentiation, then, Levinas concludes indecisively: he argues for man's exceptional ethical capacity, yet calls man an "animal." Reject- ing an inscription of human beings in a model of animality, Levinas argues that they are in the exceptional position of creatures for whom the maxim does not hold that "the aim of being is being itself" (2004, 50). But his description of Bobby belies the exceptionalism he claims to endorse: risking his life to seek human companionship (Bobby is eventually "chased . . . away" by the "sentinels"), Bobby engages in the unreasonable act that for Levinas defines ethical subjectivity. Recognizing such emotional intersubjectivity and the privileged role that the body plays in it enables us to expand our understanding of discursive registers. Levinas talks about the guards being episte- mologically and ontologically confused - unlike the dog Bobby, they</page><page sequence="23">120 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS "doubt that we were men." Dogs have a different kind of knowledge that is located in their own bodies: they know by "barking in delight" that the prisoners are men. As a different kind of social knowledge, "barking in delight" becomes Levinas's counter model to the sym- bolic order: the dog's recognition of a fellow being undoes other human beings' withholding of that recognition. Levinas's encounter with the dog marks his humanity, yet at the same time makes humanity sub- ject to recognition by the animal. In the relationship with the animal, on the liminal ground of humanized animality and animalized human- ity, a form of subjectivity emerges that is relational and removed from the violence of the symbolic order. That subjectivity is not human as much as it is humane: it is in his sympathetic engagement with the animal that Levinas renounces the violence inherent in the symbolic order. It is in the dog's "barking in delight" that Levinas sees himself as a man. In the encounter between the detained Levinas and the dog Bobby, we see suspended the differentiation between subjects and nonsubjects that underlies the symbolic order and its concomitant forms of representation. CONCLUSION Documenting as I have done here the relation between abjection and animality is a fraught enterprise because it exposes us to the risk of replicating that abjection: since violence thrives on the abjection of animalized animals, any engagement with the category of abject ani- mality in conjunction with the boundary-crossing between human beings and animals is indeed anxiety producing. We are right to be anxious about comparing detainees to dogs and dogs to detainees. But as long as we give in to that anxiety we are being complicit with the representational violence that marks animality as a site of abjec- tion. If we want to establish a regime of nonviolent recognition, a regime that marks the torture of detainees as a wrong but also pro- vides a legitimate way of critiquing acts of terror from a position of nonviolence, we need to move beyond human exceptionalism and ex- plore a more comprehensive model of representation. However, the two are not simply binaries, where we can choose one over the other. As my emphasis on bestiality as the disavowed</page><page sequence="24">AMERICAN BESTIALITY | 121 foundation of patriarchy and an ongoing practice has made clear, it is in the relation to animals that the social order establishes and repro- duces itself. It seems to me, then, that the key for negotiating between these enmeshed practices is hermeneutic. The hermeneutics I am call- ing for here are ones that read the "symbolic order" in relation to its other, that is, in relation to the bodily, the abject, the animalized that it produces at its founding. By affording that bodily register its own legibility, we achieve two things: a grounds for understanding the mechanisms by which subjectivity produces itself via bestiality, and a means for engaging critically with that production. Notes 1. For a fuller discussion of shame and its operation in the images of Abu Ghraib, see Limon. 2. Jacques Derrida has taken up this issue in relation to the physical con- sumption that this logic legitimates. He coined the phrase "carno-phallogocentrism" to describe a discourse that constructs mankind's subjectivity by allowing for the noncriminal putting-to-death of animals; see Derrida 1991, 113. Akira Lippit points out that Theodor Adorno raises similar concerns in Minima Moralia: Reflec- tions from Damaged Life (London: Verso, 1974): " According to Adorno's transferen- tial logic, violence originates in the encounter between human and nonhuman beings. . . . [T]he ethics of murder is made possible by seeing the animal first as nonhuman, then inhuman. If one's victim can be seen as inhuman, the aggressor reasons, one is then justified in performing acts of violence, even murder, upon that inhuman body, since those acts now fall beyond the jurisdiction of the anthro- pocentric law" (1119). 3. Bestiality evidently remained an issue; see Mather, 44ff. 4. Bentham was not the first philosopher to perform this shift: Michel de Montaigne had traversed similar philosophical ground in his Apology for Raymond Sebond (1580). 5. For the most current scholarship, see the journals Society and Animals and Anthrozoos. 6. Foucault himself has relatively little to say about animals in relation to the history of sexuality, but he does discuss them in conjunction with "The Insane" (see Foucault, 65-84). 7. England had been well prepared for the military's use of animal imagery in the service of violence. In her civilian life, she had worked at the aptly named Pilgrim's Pride chicken-processing plant in Moorefield, West Virginia. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) conducted an undercover investigation at that plant and caught "on video [workers] stomping on chickens, kicking them, and violently slamming them against floors and walls. Workers also ripped the</page><page sequence="25">122 I COLLEEN GLENNEY BOGGS animals' beaks off, twisted their heads off, spat tobacco into their eyes and mouths, spray-painted their faces, and squeezed their bodies so hard that the birds ex- pelled feces - all while the chickens were still alive" (quoted in Ward Harkavy, "Abu Ghraib: A Chicken in Every Plot," Village Voice, May 10, 2005, http:// blogs.villagevoice.com/pressclips/archives/2005 /05/a_chicken_in_ev.php (accessed July 22, 2010). Compared to this description and other photos from Abu Ghraib, the extreme physical violence seems muted in the photo of England and the leashed detainee. But what this picture indicates is the range of representa- tional devices that support abuse. In a 2004 op-ed piece for the Los Angeles Times, Peter Singer drew an analogy between the exemption of chickens from the so- called "Humane Methods of Slaughter Act," which Congress passed in 1978, and the exclusion of detainees from the rights conferred by the Geneva Convention (Singer and Dawn). 8. "Metaphor," in Chris Baldick, The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms (Oxford University Press, 2008), Oxford Reference Online, Oxford University Press, Dartmouth College, http:// www.oxfordreference.com/ views/ENTRY.html?sub view=Main&amp;entry=t56.e712 (accessed July 26, 2010). 9. The military working dog depicted here is Marco, a four-year-old black Belgian shepherd (Dishneau 2006a). According to a press release from the Depart- ment of Defense, MWDs are their handlers' friends, as well as "their trusted com- panion, loyal follower and No. 1 teammate" (Villarreal). The same press release also describes them as "the finest tools the military has to offer." The dog's role as friend or tool depends on the military's convenience; if historic precedent is any indication, Marco will not meet with a happy end. When World War II ended, the army ordered that all dogs who had gone through military training be killed. Of the 4,000 dogs estimated to have served in Vietnam, "281 were killed in action and no more than 250 came home"; the rest were killed, turned over to the South Viet- namese army, or simply left behind when the troops withdrew, discarded along with other military "tools" (Ravitz). 10. John Berger makes a similar point when he writes: "The eyes of an ani- mal when they consider a man are attentive and wary. The same animal may well look at other species in the same way. He does not reserve a special look for man. But by no other species except man will the animal's look be recognized as famil- iar. Other animals are held by the look. Man becomes aware of himself returning the look" (2). Works Cited Adams, Carol J. 1990. The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory. New York: Continuum. . 1994.
