(PLATES I-6) LH III-PROTOGEOMETRIC CAIRNS AT AET6S.1 Introductory note.2 The area of the Protogeometric cairns here described was first dis- covered in 1931, when we opened a trial pit (Fig. 3) which revealed part of a wall (Fig. 4, 6) and behind it what seemed to be a confused mass of stones mixed with black earth, and containing sherds, ranging from a few LH III to Protogeometric. These stones we took to be the remains of a collapsed house. In 1932 the pit was extended, principally to West and North, and though we encountered the same masses of stones all over the area, it became possible to discover some coherence in them. The plan (Fig. 3) and section (Fig. 4) give some idea of the complexity of the remains, but for the sake of clearness the accumulations of stones (all of which it was necessary to plot before they could be removed) between the surface and the remains actually shown are omitted. In the neighbourhood of wall 6 the stones explained themselves as remains of a succession of terrace-walls and their filling, built at various periods to terrace up the area to the North of them, each time with a slightly different alignment. It was only when we had got near virgin soil that the cairns became recognisable. They had naturally suffered in the process of terracing and had been further disturbed by a series of Byzantine cist graves (Fig. 3, I2-2I1; Fig. 5), the makers of which had displaced the stones and contents of the cairns and the earth above them. It is really remarkable that the cairns have survived at all and it is only owing to the skilful and patient work of Miss Lorimer that their structural character has been recognised. 1 For Schliemann's excavations at Aet6s see Schliemann, Ithaca, Peloponnesus, and Troy, 1868, pp. 22-36; and for Vollgraff's, B.C.H. 29, 1905, pp. I46-150. 2 I wish to thank Mrs. G.

For the sake of brevity, only the two best-preserved cairns (2 and 3) are described. I and 4 conform in their general character, but were found to be so much damaged that a full description seems unnecessary. Except for a few aligned stones resting on virgin soil and a few sherds there were no remains of 5, which may not be a cairn at all. A word regarding the building to the North (Fig. 3, 9), of which only the foundations of the North and West sides are preserved. These founda- tions rest on virgin soil, and sherds of various kinds from Protogeometric to 5th century were found in confusion in the soil above them. This con- fusion is not surprising seeing that excavations licit and illicit have been made at this spot. I fancy the sanctuary was built by the Corinthians; but, whether this is so or not, the offerings were deposited not at the sanctuary but some above the cairns and most at the foot of wall 6, which was built (certainly by the first Corinthians) to delimit the cairn area and prevent its being washed away. The fact that the offerings are associated with the cairns and not with the sanctuary is in itself evidence that the cairns are cairns and not chance accumulations of stones. The position of the site is at the highest point of the saddle which connects Mt. Aet6s on the West with Mt. Merovigli on the East, and over which passes the road from the Port of Mdlo to the Port of Pisaet6 (Fig. I; P1. I, 2), from where the crossing to Cephallenia is made. The saddle is roughly equidistant from the two seas. In the terraced vineyards that surround the modern chapel of St. George are many traces of ancient habitation, and on the steep scrub-covered slopes of Aet6s stood a small town divided into two halves and surrounded by walls which are connected with a walled enclosure on the summit (P1. I). The North and South walls of the town were continued Eastwards down the slope and probably enclosed part of the saddle, on which, just North of the highest point, a small piece of polygonal wall running East and West was discovered, to the North face of which a Hellenic tower (P1. I; P1. 2, 5; Fig. 2) of good fifth-century masonry seems to have been added at a later date. On the shore at Pisaet6 a fine piece of wall is preserved running North and South. A study of all these walls will be made by Miss Benton, and I will only say here that they are built in different styles, polygonal and isodomic, that the pottery associated with them is mainly fifth century and that there are no remains which can definitely be assigned to the period of the cairns.1 A local cult of some kind must be assumed to account for the cairns. When Leake visited Aet6s there was a spring here from which streams flowed into the valleys on either side. These have now dried up, but the original cult may have centred round the spring. 1 A few Protogeometric sherds were found just above virgin soil at a depth of about 3 m. in a trial-pit on the East side of the road (P1. I).</page><page sequence="5">26 W. A.

W. A. HEURTLEY. I. THE CAIRNS (Figs. 3-7; PIs. I, 2). South and South-East of this undated sanctuary and immediately North of the region of the Protocorinthian deposit lay a well-marked area characterised by curious accumulations of stones and pot-sherds whose SECTION X-Y 2.67 -B  .r 'a7 ~31~3  i4" T~-~" -2.251 ~p29n i~Pe~Pse 2.60  67  65  ja~z~3~ a.z 0 1 2 3 4M Modern fill containiny stones and Proto Corinthian sherds etc Fil/ at back of Terrace-wall (6) Black ear/h of cairns FIG. 4.-SECTION ALONG LINE X-Y (CF. FIG. 3). nature cannot be determined with certainty. That they are not fortuitous the association of stone and pottery shows; moreover, each group con- tained a stratum of densely black earth mixed with sherds and patches of red. Further, the earth of the whole cairn area, except where it had been disturbed by terrace-making or Byzantine burials, was sufficiently blackened to form a marked contrast with the light brown of the natural soil. It would seem, therefore, that we have to do with the remains either of houses or of funerary monuments; and as the evidence, mainly negative, on the whole favours the latter alternative, the structures are described from this point of view and are provisionally called cairns. Over the whole area in the upper levels Protocorinthian sherds were found, together with a few contemporary or even later objects; they were extremely few in the brown earth East of Cairn I, and below Protocorinthian level nothing at all was found in this quarter. Within the cairns the sherds were almost entirely of Protogeometric coarse domestic or patterned ware, together with</page><page sequence="7">28 H. L. LORIMER a fair amount of LH III and a little Corinthian Geometric. With two doubtful exceptions, no Protocorinthian or later sherds were found within the cairns, which are therefore to be ascribed to the earliest period of the occupation of the site. Various small objects of a kind proper to the Geometric and Protocorinthian deposits are probably to be explained as later offerings, placed above the cairns, a few of which had found their way into the cairns themselves.1 North of Cairn I and extending about a metre farther West the upper stones of Cairn 2 appeared at level 2"Io m. They formed an upper layer with base-level 2"25 m., fairly continuous and mostly two stones deep, while beneath them on the South and East sides a line of stones whose base-level sloped from 2"45 m. to 2"60 m. marked the limit of the cairn in these directions. At one point on the South three stones had been removed to accommodate the skull of a Byzantine interment, but as they had been replaced to enclose it (Fig. 3, 12; Fig. 6 a), the line of the boundary was preserved. Within the boundary there were only a few stones of any size, but at six points (see Plan, Fig. 3) there were heaps of exceptionally large sherds from great vessels of coarse ware and some fragments of tile, while the whole floor was stained red by the disintegration of yet others. The Southern limit broke off to the West, where a sharp rise of .18 m. to "2o m. in the level of stereo occurred, but the 2"IO m. stratum of black and red earth, stone and sherds extended "90 m. farther West. The limits of the cairn on the higher level cannot be determined; it was probably encroached upon by the seventh-century pavement to the West and South-West, and certainly by the Byzantine graves 13 and 14 to the North. The former cut right through the black stratum, which, however, reappeared just beyond the North-East corner of grave I3, yielding between levels 2"25 m. and 2"37 m. a number of small objects, probably later offerings, viz. a bronze finger-ring, the head of a pair of bronze tweezers, three amber beads, and several of glass and bronze. On the West margin, at level 2"27 m., was found the upper part of a bronze pin with a flat terminal disc and a single swelling of the shank a little below it (Fig. 44, no. II 7). This may belong to the original grave-goods, since the type is Protogeometric in origin,2 but the specimens from Salamis, Mouliani and Vr6kastro either have nothing to mark the head, or else a mere thickening. The approximation of this specimen to the regular Protocorinthian type with its terminal disc and two small swellings suggests that it comes late in the series. This would agree with the pottery of the cairn, which included several fragments of flat- 1 All pottery and objects later than Protogeometric from the cairn area will be included in the study of the Corinthian Geometric and Protocorinthian deposits found South of wall 6. This study is to be made shortly by Mr. M. Robertson and will, it is hoped, appear in a later volume of the Annual. 2 Cf.

L. LORIMER bottomed cups which come very near to the Corinthian Geometric cups (e.g. Fig. 18, no. 54) in form; it is not, however, quite certain that the pin belongs to the cairn. In its neighbourhood were found several roughly- made miniature cups (Fig. 38, nos. I12, I 13) of a type fairly common on the site. The higher part of the cairn was divided from the lower by a row of stones resting on virgin soil and following the line of the drop in the level of stereo. This circumstance suggested that the cairn, though certainly forming one whole, since the black stratum extended over both portions, might have been built in successive instalments for a series of depositions. The pottery, however, does not support this hypothesis. Apart from the rough domestic ware which formed the bulk of it, almost all the sherds were patterned Protogeometric and were found equally in all parts. Of the not very numerous Corinthian Geometric one sherd was found in the higher part. It is true that two sherds of fine Protocorinthian were found just within the stones of the South-East extremity, but as there is no other certain instance and only one doubtful one of anything Protocorinthian being found within a cairn, it is probable that they are intrusive. The enormous accumulations of rough ware in the eastern part looked as though they might mark successive depositions, but the presence of tile and the fact that it was impossible to reconstruct from any group of sherds anything like a complete pot point rather to broken earthenware being used as an alternative to stone in building the mound. The sherds may represent the vessels of the funeral feast, deliberately shattered and dis- persed.1 Apart from the coarse plain ware most of the sherds of Cairn 2 came from large Protogeometric vases decorated with bands of black glaze-paint. Cairn 3 (Figs. 6 b; 7 a, b), which lies to the West and North-West of the others, probably represents two contiguous mounds, distinguished on the plan as 3 a and 3 b. What is there shown as the South part of 3 b was removed at the beginning of the 1932 campaign, when it was still regarded as part of the ruins of a house destroyed by fire, and it is probable that a few scattered stones were then removed without record from the South face of 3 a. Originally 3 b had extended over a metre further West, for its black stratum accompanied by formless groups of stones had appeared in the pit opened at the end of the 1931 campaign (Fig. 3). At the middle of 3 a black earth began at I'86 m., and between that level and I'92 m. was found a Byzantine glazed sherd (I2th-I5th cent.) 2 and a Corinthian Geometric fragment, and just above 2"oo m. a Proto- corinthian fragment, both of which are probably intrusive. At 2"02 m. the stones of the topmost layer were visible (Fig. 7 a); they were discontinu- ous, interspersed with sherds (Fig. 7 a) and intensely black earth. The 1 Cf.

Benaki kindly gave this information.</page><page sequence="10">EXCAVATIONS IN ITHACA, I. 31 sherds were mostly of coarse Protogeometric ware, and even the finer pieces were mostly undecorated. There were also the usual red patches and a large quantity of tile. To the East and South the cairn was bounded by a single course of large stones forming the kind of retaining wall (Fig. 7 b) already noticed in the case of cairn I. The earth of the whole area was extremely black except in the North-East angle, where it was brown, a sure indication of disturbance, though still mixed with abundant sherds of coarse domestic ware. The disturbing cause was found between levels 2"20 m. and 2"60 m. in the two Byzantine graves 19 and 20 (Fig. 3). When the retaining wall on the East was removed, the earth under it was found to be black, and outside the wall many sherds of the familiar coarse variety were found in brown earth. They had doubtless been thrown out on the occasion of the Byzantine interments, while others had been shovelled back above the graves; only so can the presence of prehistoric sherds immediately above Byzantine graves be accounted for. No doubt the Byzantine sherd noted above made its way in on the same occasion, and possibly the Geo- metric and Protocorinthian fragments also. West of these graves the black stratum showed in the face of the unexcavated area to the North between levels 2'38 m. and 2'53 m. The drop from I'86 m., the level at which black earth appeared above the stones, shows that the cairn must have terminated a very little way to the North. The black earth continued down to virgin soil, which under the stones was not reached till 2"7o m., whereas the base- level of the stones was 2"84 m. to the West and 2'52 m. to the East. Below the layer of sherds and stones at 2'O2 m. came two layers of stones fairly continuous, and covering the same area; they yielded few sherds, but many fragments of bone. In 3 b (Fig. 6 b) black earth began at level 2"o5 m. and continued down to virgin soil at 2"65-2'75 m.; the stones lay between 2"32 m. and 2'55 m., and in the Northern part were arranged in two layers. For the lowest stone of the Southern part a bed had been cut in stereo. Above the Southern part were found between levels 2"oo m. and 2"25 m. abundant sherds of Corinthian Geometric, including two with a large design of hatched maeander, and some small objects such as occurred in the Protocorinthian deposit. Below 2"25 m. no Protocorinthian was found, but a good deal of coarse and fine Protogeometric, including the two vases, 14 (Fig. i i) and 71 (Fig. 22), and some miniature rough cups. In the spaces between the stones were found at one point fragments of a large pot, and under them scraps of bone which appeared to have been burned, and at another one of the characteristic heaps of sherds. Another such heap occurred in the Northern part at level 2"45 m.; it contained the fragment of a four-lugged pan (like no. 109, Fig. 31 ; Io8, Fig. 37). It is probable that 3 b occupied a good deal of the space marked 3 c on the plan. The black stratum appeared in the East face of the excavation</page><page sequence="11">32 H. L. LORIMER a b FIG. 6.-a, CAIRN 2 FROM WEST, SHOWING BYZANTINE BURIAL (RIGHT) AND SHERD NUCLEI; b, CAIRN 3 a AND b, FROM SOUTH.</page><page sequence="12">EXCAVATIONS IN ITHACA, I. 33 up to a point "50 m. South of 3 b, but it did not extend into the trial pit; it reappeared, however, together with a few sherds of the usual cairn types among and under the lowest stones of the ancient terrace-wall (6 on plan, Fig. 3). South of 3 b, stereo sloped sharply downwards and was cut out to form a bed for the stones in question and, less deeply, to admit the edges of the second course. It seems probable, therefore, that 3 b originally extended as far as this wall, which may have been built to mark off the cemetery when it ceased to be used; 1 or the lowest course may have been a retaining wall contemporary with the cairn. 3 c contained brown earth only, though of a shade rather darker than that of the natural soil; it yielded a number of sherds at different levels, but all of familiar cairn types, perhaps cairn material, which was used as a fill for the terrace wall, as was found to be the case further West. A small round-mouthed oinochoe (Fig. 22, no. 72), found immediately South of 3 b between levels 2"55 m. and 2"65 m., may have been in its original position. One patterned sherd makes an incontestable join with a sherd from 3 a. This may suggest, but does not prove, that 3 a and 3 b were parts of one great cairn. If it was customary, as has been suggested, to break the vessels used at funerals and scatter the fragments, one sherd might easily be found at this distance from 3 a; or it may have been thrown out when the Byzantine graves were dug. The somewhat blackened earth characteristic of the whole cairn area (except where interrupted by the Byzantine graves 13, 17 and 18) filled the space between cairns 2 and 3, exhibiting a few red patches and yielding occasional Protogeometric sherds. Farther North, however, above the Byzantine graves 15 and 16 and extending into the trench between the modern terrace-wall and the Eastern limit of the excavation, the earth from an average level of 2o0o-2"20 m. down to virgin soil, though extremely black, was of a different and peculiar character. Stiff, greasy, and tending to cake when exposed to the sun, it showed no red patches and was practic- ally devoid of sherds. The very few which occurred were featureless and probably late. It will be convenient to postpone the consideration of this region and to examine first the character of the cairns. As has been said, they can hardly be anything but the remains of houses or of tombs. The presence of a good deal of tile in 2 and 3, the best-preserved examples, at first sight favours the interpretation as houses. On the other hand, the total absence of ground-plan, foundations and household implements seems hardly reconcilable with it; and if such immense quantities of sherds were found within houses, it should have been possible to reconstruct a very large number of vases, whereas, in fact, the failure to do so was almost complete. 1 5, if it is a cairn, was for some reason excluded.

To the interpretation as memorial cairns there does not seem to be any insuperable objection. It is true that no certainly human remains have been found.1 Fragments of bone were found in all the cairns and sporadically all over the cairn area; some undoubtedly came from the bones of birds and animals, but the great majority were too fragmentary to admit of identification. The two groups of apparently burned bones from I and 3 were unfortunately in the latter category. If, however, the cairns had been raised over uncremated corpses, traces of bones would have been found lying in something like the order of a skeleton, whereas the small fragments actually found were scattered at random and occurred at all levels. Cremated bones, however, would have little chance of resisting the corrosive action of the soil, and, in fact, in cremation and even in inhumation graves it is quite common to find no human remains 2 unless the ashes have been placed in an urn. Undoubtedly the majority of these bones came from funeral offerings or funeral feast, and whether cooked or no, were not cremated. If, however, cremation was practised at Aet6s, the bodies were not burned on the sites of the cairns, for nowhere was the earth baked hard, as it would be on the site of a pyre. This sug- gests a possible explanation of the greasy black earth described above. Such earth has been noted where bodies have been somewhat imperfectly burned 3; and if the cairns are funeral monuments, it may be that they commemorated cremations and that the greasy earth marks the place of the ustrinum. The cremation of Patroklos, however poetically enhanced, must have a foundation in reality; and if it were customary to lap the body in fat and burn carcases along with it, the site of the pyre would on each occasion be saturated with grease. That here also there was no trace of earth baked hard by repeated fires is not an insuperable objection, for all such traces might well be destroyed when the Byzantine graves were dug. That these graves were not, like the others, associated with intrusive brown earth may be explained by the fact that the diggers encountered no stones as they did in the cairns and merely replaced the black earth which they had removed. If this explanation is correct, the stratum of black earth in each of the cairns are the remains of the pyre, shovelled up along with the the bones and carried from the ustrinum to the site of the cairn. Over them the mound of stones, sherds and earth would be built, for except in the somewhat doubtful case of a group of sherds from I, the pottery showed no traces of fire. Chronologically there is no objection to the theory of cremation, which 1 A report on the bones is awaited. 2 See e.g. Ure, Sixth and Fifth Century Pottery from Rhitsona, pp. 3 and 4. 3 See Olshausen, Zeitschriftfiir Ethnologie, 1892, p. 139.</page><page sequence="15">36 H. L. LORIMER is found on other Protogeometric sites 1; but the evidence at Aet6s is obviously insufficient, and there does not seem to be any prospect of attain- ing to greater certainty unless some kindred but less enigmatic cemetery is discovered. At Hilos, which affords the nearest parallel, the evidence was explicit; the cairns were raised on the sites of the pyres, the ground under them was baked hard, and there were recognisable human remains. THE PAVEMENT. This area was opened immediately to the West of cairns I and 2 to find the limit of the black stratum in this direction. At level I'6o m., about '30 m. below the surface, two female terracotta masks of the ordinary classical type were found. Immediately below this level a black stratum of the average depth of "12 m. appeared in the North-West part of the area; it contained numerous fragments of roof-tile, but very few sherds, and those only of rough and featureless ware. This stratum presumably marks the latest ancient occupation of the site. At level I'84 m. a very rough pavement was reached (Io on plan, Fig. 3) which had no doubt originally formed a rectangle, though now showing triangular gaps both to East and West. After an interval of light brown and unproductive earth the black stratum was reached at a level which varied from 2'20 m. to 2'25 m.; its maximum depth was '04 m. and it contained a few scattered sherds of Protocorinthian. A 'pilgrim flask' with concentric circles on the sides (no. 74; Figs. 24, 25) was found, resting on the black stratum, and slightly lower, the upper part of a typical Proto- corinthian pin and a small perforated disc (Fig. 43, no. 121). The black stratum rested on virgin soil. As nothing later than Protocorinthian was found, the pavement must have been laid down early, presumably not mucn alter 700 B.C. H. L.

Wheel-made. The vases are well baked, but the clay, which is probably local, seems to have been not well adapted for pot-making, since at the unpainted parts of the surface and in the break it is soft and powdery. The colour is normally buff, sometimes greenish-white. A thin mechanical slip of the same colour as the clay forms the ground for the paint, which sometimes covers the whole surface, sometimes is applied only as ornament. As in the case of good Mycenaean pottery, the colour is dark or light accord- ing to the flow of paint in the brush or the pressure of the stroke. Thus black or dark brown thin out to lighter tones of the same colour, or, alter- nately, a short light line may end in a thick dark blob. Deep red thins out to pink, and brown and black have often a blue or purplish tinge. The light tones are also due to some extent to the fact that much of the paint adhered to the ground when the sherds were removed, and even the most careful washing tended further to weaken the colours. If the paint ever had a lustrous quality, this has now disappeared, and it seems that both clay and paint were indifferent. Only in the case of a few sherds, probably imported, has the paint retained its original lustre and the unpainted parts their firm and polished surface. 1 Cf.

The wheel-made pottery forms a consistent but not uniform group; that is to say, the passage from a pure Mycenaean (LH III) phase to full Protogeometric can be observed within it. LH III elements are kylikes, stirrup-vases, loop-handled bowls in which the rim is only slightly everted (12), the bowl with ribbon-handles on the rim (91), the pilgrim-flask (74),1 rope-handles,2 and among ornaments, the freehand concentric loops.3 Fine lustrous paint also is here a criterion of LH III ware. Protogeometric elements are the shallow cups with flat bases,4 plastic rings on the kraters,5 the high conical feet, the advanced rectilinear ornament and concentric circles or half-circles drawn with a multiple brush. The fine group of vases from Lakkithra in Cephallenia recently published by Marinitos,6 well illustrate the kind of LH III ware which was being made in the Ionian islands in the latter half of the thirteenth and the beginning of the twelfth century B.C.7 It is noteworthy that here some of the kylikes have swollen stems 8 and that ringed stems 9 are just developing from them; that rectilinear motives like triangles, diamonds, etc. are still being drawn with slightly curved outlines,10 and that the 'Close' Style is in process of development from the 'Panel' Style.1 Approximately con- temporary is the vase group from Dikita with its almost 'Close' Style krater,12 while the vases from P6lis in Ithaca, shortly to be published,1a seem to belong to the end of the same, with some extension into the succeeding (i.e. Aet6s) period.14 1 Cf. Furtwingler-Loeschke, Myk. Vasen, P1. xiv 92, P1. xx I49 (two-handled); for Protogeometric examples cf. Hall, Vrdkastro, Fig. 89 and A.J.A. v, Pls. I, 2 (Kavotisi). 2 They are, of course, more characteristic of Protogeometric. For references see B.S.A. xxxi, 47, note I. 3 Cf. Marinitos, 'Eqaai. 1932, P1. 4, 5; P1. 5, 13.

Benton in a later volume of the Annual. 14 Shown by the frequency of kylikes with ringed stems and a few sherds of the advanced rectilinear ornament as at Aet6s. Ringed stems are found in Cypriote 'sub- Mycenaean' (i.e. twelfth century) and there is one from Olympia (Olympia, Textband IV, p. Io9, No. I285). Swollen stems occur at Asine in a 'Granary' Style context (cf. A.A., Iq27, p. 379) and at Vr6kastro (Hall, Vrdkastro, Fig. 89).</page><page sequence="43">64 W. A. HEURTLEY Those vases from Aet6s which are LH III illustrate a further stage in the development of provincial Mycenaean.1 There is a high proportion of ringed stems among the kylix fragments; the 'Close' Style has not matured but, instead, we have simple arrangements of concentric loops; 2 spiraliform ornaments have disappeared; the loop-handled bowls are slimmer and have well-defined necks; their feet are higher and more conical. Since 'Philistine' pottery is derived partly from the 'Close' Style and its appearance in Palestine cannot be later than I I80, it follows that the 'Close' Style must have been in existence by the beginning of the twelfth century. The' Close' Style is itself derived from the earlier' Panel' Style, but since in Cephallenia the transition from the one to the other has not been quite effected 3 it is to be inferred that the latest elements there must be dated somewhere about I200.4 Most of the LH III vases at Aet6s must therefore be later than 1200, and only the earliest of them (e.g. the imported LH III and perhaps some of the kylikes) can be placed before that date. The greater number probably belong to the second half of the century. The Protogeometric at Aet6s follows directly upon the Mycenaean and develops out of it." The tendencies apparent in the latest Mycenaean are merely carried a step further and the passage from one to the other occurs without perceptible break, except that which is caused by the introduction of a multiple brush and the consequent mechanisation of ornament. Apart from that, there is, as far as I can see, scarcely anything in form or ornament which is not anticipated or implied, if not at Aet6s itself, somewhere in Mycenaean pottery. 1 Many of the Kavofisi vases illustrate the same stage, e.g. A.J.A. v, P1. I (bottom row) pilgrim flask; P1. ii (top row) pilgrim flask; (middle row) two-handled bowls with the same slim form as ours, and in one case the same ornament; (bottom row) a bowl with pinched-out handles; P1. 2, 4, the form of the hydria is extraordinarily like ours (Fig. 26, no. 75). 2 And the loops have lost their fringes or 'cogs,' for which see Marinitos, loc. cit. P1. iv, 5; P1. vi, 41; P1. x, 148; Wace, Chamber Tombs at Mycenae, P1. xi, 8, Io. There are some good examples in the Patras Museum from tombs in Achaia. 3 Cf. the kraters, Marinitos Eqrlp. 1912, P1. v, 13; Kyparissis AsX-r. 1919, p. 102, figs. I7, I8. 4 When writing the above, I overlooked the fact that a very similar conclusion had already been reached by Skeat (The Dorians in Archaeology, pp. 29, 30), and I was not, consciously at any rate, influenced by it, in forming my own opinion. 5 I formerly thought that a 'sub-Mycenaean' phase should be interposed between the latest Mycenaean and Protogeometric (cf. B.S.A. xxxi, p. 52). I now think this is not so. The Salamis group is still Mycenaean, not sub-Mycenaean. The term 'Sub- Mycenaean ' is, however, appropriate to the mixed twelfth-century style of Cyprus, and to ' Philistine' pottery in Palestine. Cf. a paper which will appear in the Quarterly of Dept. of Antiquities in Palestine vol. iv pts. 3, 4.</page><page sequence="44">EXCAVATIONS IN ITHACA, I. 65 It is not possible to fix precisely the lower chronological limit of the group. It is unlikely that the period covered by it lasted till 850 B.c., the approximate date of the earliest Corinthian Geometric. It is true that among the Geometric vases are certain elements (some peculiar to Ithaca) which look as if they were derived from the local Protogeometric, such as the use of concentric loops,1 and ornaments like 47-49 on fragments of similar form. These may, however, be explained by supposing that the Corinthians found Protogeometric sherds lying round the cairns and borrowed such ornaments as took their fancy for their own pots-evidence, incidentally, that the Corinthian vases were made locally. But such forms as the trefoil-lipped jugs with rope-handles, the pyxides with two-piece handles must have passed into the Geometric style before its transmission to Ithaca. In Ithaca itself the transitional stage is not represented. Actually the Protogeometric gives the impression of not having got far beyond the early stage of its development from Mycenaean. The mechanical dexterity and assurance of the Marmiriane potters, for example, has not been achieved, and, though we can be sure that the Ithacan Proto- geometric belongs to the eleventh century, whether it lasted into the tenth or later it is impossible to say. The hand-made vases have no relation to the wheel-made and must belong to a different tradition. The bowls (I0o4, o105) are of the same form as bowls found at Pelicita in the remains of the Early Helladic settlement,2 which, however, there is reason to suppose continued to exist throughout the Middle into the Late Helladic Age. The ' sauce-boat' (Io6) too is in the Early Helladic tradition and it seems therefore best to regard the hand- made vases as belated products of the pre-Mycenaean civilisation of the island. Matt-painted sherds similar to Io6, lo7 were found at P6lis. As far as the Homeric associations of Ithaca are concerned, if our conclusions, based purely on archaeological grounds, are correct, the ashes covered by the cairns at Aet6s may include those of men who were alive during and perhaps took part in the war against Troy.
