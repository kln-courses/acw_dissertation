<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE EAST SLOPE OF JERUSALEM AND THE TERRACES OF THE KIDRON* LA WRENCE E. STAGER, University of Chicago To her many archaeological accomplishments Kathleen Kenyon added yet another during the excavations in Jerusalem from 1961 to 1967.1 She cut a daringly deep trench down the eastern slope of "Mt. Ophel," just southeast of the site where Solomon's temple and palace presumably once stood. There on this steep slope, she uncovered tier after tier of architectural terracing buried beneath an avalanche of stone and debris. Kenyon was convinced that she had located the much-disputed mill ' of the Bible (2 Sam. 5:9; 1 Kings 9:15, 24; 11:27; 1 Chron. 11:8; 2 Chron. 32:5). I shall argue, rather, that she found a segment of the sadm6t qidrdn (2 Kings 23:4). Three or four centuries before the east slope was terraced, the MB II inhabitants of Jerusalem built a fortification wall some 50 m below the crest of the hill.2 Founded on bedrock and laid at right angles to the slope which inclined at 25* (the modern surface has a steeper gradient of ca. 45"), this wall served as part of the eastern defense line into the eighth century B.C. Upslope and contemporary with the early stages of the fortification, Kenyon discovered less substantial wall fragments from buildings that had once clung to the hillside, unsupported by anchoring platforms.3 By the fourteenth century B.C. the Jerusalemites had learned how to build slope terraces. They completely transformed the eastern part of their city into a terraced landscape that was maintained through frequent repair and rebuilding until the Neo- Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem in 587 B.c. *I am most grateful to Dennis Pardee, G6sta Ahlstr6m, Jeffrey Tigay, Monique Brinkman, and Yigal Shiloh for their critical comments on an earlier version of this paper. I After each season of excavation in Jerusalem, K. M. Kenyon published a preliminary report in PEQ: 94 (1962): 72-89; 95 (1963): 7-21; 96 (1964): 7-18; 97 (1965): 9-20; 98 (1966): 73-88; 99 (1967): 65-73; 100 (1968): 97-109. For popular syntheses of the results, see Kenyon, Jerusalem: Excavating 3000 Years of History (London, 1967) (hereafter, Exca- vating) and idem, Digging Up Jerusalem (New York, 1974) (hereafter, Digging). Her most recent and, I am sad to say, final summary of Jerusalem, written shortly before her death, appears in The Bible and Recent Archaeology (Atlanta, Georgia, 1978). 2 Kenyon's "Jebusite" wall between contours 665- 655 m referred to in Excavating as Wall 1, in Digging as Wall NB. The segment excavated formed a tower or part of a gate. This fortification was presumably replaced by hypothetical Wall 2 (Exca- vating), although no stones survived. This was suc- ceeded in the late eighth-early seventh century B.C. by a massive defense line, 5.00 m wide, Wall 3 (Excavating) = Wall NA (Digging). 3 Kenyon, PEQ 95 (1963): 12. The Early Bronze Age builders of cAi (et-Tell) laid their house walls directly on sloping bedrock (J. A. Callaway, per- sonal communication). This practice contrasted sharply with that of their Iron Age successors, more than a millennium later, who knew how to level the slope by constructing terraces (see n. 21 below).

Some of these revetments reached a height of 10 m or more.4 The construction and fill behind the retaining walls were, however, quite different from those of an agricultural terrace in which deep profiles of imported soil were leveled up to the top of the revetment. Instead, the builders set rib- walls at 1.00 m intervals or more behind, and at right angles to, the retaining wall. They then filled in this series of compartments with medium-sized stones packed in with a little soil and rubble.5 In this way they provided flat and, if maintained, stable platforms for buildings and other structures on the steep terrain. The side walls and roof supports of a few houses set on these stone platforms remained intact even after their destruction by the armies of Nebuchadnezzar. Kenyon repeatedly identified the architectural terraces with the mill6 of Jerusalem,6 a feature of the "City of David" so familiar to the biblical writers that they never bothered to explain what it was. In 1952 J. Simons summed up the dispute about the nature, origin, and location of mill6 this way: As usual, the great number of theories claiming to have solved these problems is inversely proportional to the amount of clear data. With the exception of one single point, viz., that in one way or another the Millo was an element of the defences of the City of David in Solomon's time, everything that has been said or can be said about it does not go beyond a reasonable possibility, and quite often it is less than that.7 Kenyon's excavations determined the probable limits of Jerusalem before and during the United Monarchy. This alone eliminated several older notions about the location of mill6 '. Since nearly everyone agreed that the etymological sense of mill6 ' was probably "filling," Kenyon found a receptive audience of archaeologists and biblical scholars for her clever solution to the problem. Yet I think there are reasons to remain skeptical about this widely accepted identification. To a Late Bronze or Iron Age passerby looking up to the west from the Kidron Valley, the east slope of Jerusalem would have appeared rather like a great flight of 4 Kenyon, Excavating, p. 32. 5 Idem, PEQ 95 (1963): 12 and 97 (1965): 13. 6 Idem, PEQ 95 (1963): 14; PEQ 97 (1965): 13-14; idem, Royal Cities of the Old Testament (New York, 1971), p. 35; idem, Digging, pp. 100, 103; idem, The Bible and Recent Archaeology, p. 50. 7 J.

The stone and rubble cores would have been completely concealed by the retaining walls in front and the various structures on top. If the literal meaning of mill6 ' provides an essential clue to its nature, i.e., a "filling" of some sort, it is not clear to me why the ancient writers would have singled out the filling as the most salient feature of the stone terraces, which stretched for hundreds of meters along the east slope. The mill6 o of Jerusalem seems to have had a more precise location: "David built the city round about from the Millo inward" (2 Sam. 5:9). Olga Tufnell suggested that the raised platform which elevated the Iron Age governor's "palace" above its surroundings at Lachish might have been a mill/'.9 In Jerusalem (Area G, fig. 1), Y. Shiloh has recently unearthed a magnificent stepped stone structure, at least 15 m high. (Its upper courses were already exposed by Macalister and redated by Kenyon to the Hasmonean period.) Shiloh has conclusively demonstrated that the stepped structure predates the eighth century B.C. pillared houses built over its midsection. Perhaps the stepped structure served as a base for the citadel wall or a podium for a building(s) of the royal acropolis.'0 If further excavations show that the royal precincts did extend that far south of the Temple Mount, then the stepped structure might qualify as a candidate for mill6 '. Another objection to Kenyon's identification of the terraces with mill6 concerns the date of its construction. As John Gray has stressed, the biblical data provide no compelling reason for dating the construction of mill6 ' before the United Monarchy and probably no earlier than Solomon's reign (see n. 7 above). Yet the Jebusites began building these terraces in the Late Bronze Age." There is another biblical phrase, gadm6t qidrdn, which I would translate "terraces of the Kidron," that seems to me to be a more apt designation of the architectural terraces excavated on the east slope of Jerusalem. Kidron offers no problems: it is the place-name for the wadi, or valley, that runs along the east side of Jerusalem and eventually empties into the Dead Sea. The meaning of sdmt, which occurs five times in the Bible and twice in Ugaritic, is much more troublesome.12 Its etymology is unknown. The term appears to be feminine 9 0.

Geller, Parallelism in Early Biblical Poetry, Harvard Semitic Monographs, no. 20 (Missoula, Montana, 1979), pp. 132-33. 14 In this mythological text M6t, the god of death, is the probable victim of the vine-dressers, although the meaning of the second element (-4r) of the deity's name is unclear. (For a discussion of the binomial designation of M6t, see D. T. Tsumura, "A Ugaritic God, MT- W-9R, and his Two Weapons," Ugarit-Forschungen 6 [1974]: 407-12.) The last line of the passage is the most difficult. M. Pope renders it: "Let them lop his tendrils [?dmth] like a vine" ("Mot" in IDB, Suppl. [Nashville, Tennessee, 1976], pp. 607-8). But "tendrils" is a contextual guess that cannot be sustained in light of the comparative biblical evidence, especially ?adm6t qidr6n (2 Kings 23:4). I prefer J. C. de Moor's analysis in which the h of ?dmth is taken as the adverbial suffix of direction rather than the pronominal 3 m.s. suffix and ylql, as a 9-form of *qyl, "to fall" (The Seasonal Pattern in the Ugaritic Myth of Baclu according to the Version of llimilku, Alter Orient und Altes Testament, vol. 16 [Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1971], p. 79, n. 30). J. C. L. Gibson captured much of the meaning of the viticultural metaphor in his exegesis of the passage: "He [M6t] is set upon by vine-dressers who prune and bind him and cast him down on the terrace like so much dead wood" (Canaanite Myths and Legends [Edinburgh, 1977], p. 28). 15 De Moor, Seasonal Pattern, p. 125. 16 Albright's views were reported by M.

In the Levant, then as now, these are the products of plants that are usually cultivated on the narrow strips of agricultural terraces rather than in open fields where cereals are more often grown. If my understanding of the Ugaritic evidence is correct, then already by the Late Bronze Age terraced vineyards were a common enough sight in the hills behind Ugarit that bards could evoke their imagery in sustained metaphor without fear of being misunderstood. There is now archaeological evidence of agricultural terracing in the central high- lands of Palestine as early as ca. 1200 B.C., if not before. The best-dated examples of this terrace type come from the Iron I village of Ai. They were excavated by J. A. Callaway at two sites just outside and downslope from the small settlement.'" The slopes below Khirbet Raddana were also girdled with terraces in the twelfth-eleventh centuries B.C.19 These small hilltop villages sustained by terrace farming are typical of the nearly 100 new settlements founded in the hills at that time.20 These highland villagers were well advanced in the techniques of terrace agriculture when they established their settlements de novo on hilltops and laid out their terraced plots on the slopes below. We have already seen that in the Late Bronze Age, but apparently not before, the Jerusalemites had mastered the techniques of architectural terracing. During periods of population increase in this hilly environment with few arable valleys, it would not have taken much imagination on their part to extend the concept to agricultural terracing as well, replacing stone fill with soil. It is also possible that the transposition could have worked in the other direction, but the vicissitudes of excavation and preservation around Jerusalem have thus far provided only architectural examples from the Late Bronze and Iron Ages.21 18 Callaway, "The 1966 cAi (et-Tell) Excavations," BASOR 196 (1969): 16 and figs. 10-11. 19See my article "Agriculture," IDB, Suppl., p. 13. For excavations in the village above the ter- raced slopes, see J. A. Callaway and R. E. Cooley, "A Salvage Excavation at Raddana, in Bireh," BASOR 201 (1971): 9-19. 20 These estimates are based on various surveys of the region: E. F. Campbell, "The Shechem Area Survey," BASOR 190 (1968): 19-41; J. Sapin, "Le Plateau central de Benjamin: essai de geographie humaine et historique (Secteur Rimallah-Nebi Samwil)" (M.A. thesis, Jerusalem, 1968-69); and M. Kochavi, ed., Judaea, Samaria, and the Golan: Archaeological Survey 1967-1968 (Jerusalem, 1972). In 1972-73 1 conducted a survey of several sites (many of them included in the preceding reports) that focused on terracing. For the results of that survey and a synthesis of the village economy, see my article "Anatomy of the Highland Village" in 'Ai (et- Tell): A Case Study in Biblical Archaeology, Callaway, ed., ASOR Monographs, (forthcoming). Later I learned that C. H. J. de Geus had also made a study of terracing that same year, which he sum- marized in "The Importance of Archaeological Research into the Palestinian Agricultural Terraces, with an Excursus on the Hebrew Word gbR," PEQ 107 (1975): 65-74. 1 agree with his conclusions about the widespread use of terracing in the Hill Country in the Iron I period but doubt that the introduction of terrace farming occurred no earlier than ca. 1200 B.C. 21 Seven kilometers west of Jerusalem a small Iron 11 hilltop settlement with agricultural terraces built on the slopes below has recently been partially excavated (G. Edelstein and M. Kislev, "Mevasseret Yerushalayim: The Ancient Settlement and its Agri- cultural Terraces," BA 44 [1981]: 53-56). Wall 1066 and Wall 2073 from EB II Gezer are designated "terrace walls" by the excavators. They might have been "retaining" walls of some sort. It is clear that they were not used to retain slope terraces for agriculture (W. G. Dever et al., Gezer II: Report of the 1967-70 Seasons in Fields 1 and II [Jerusalem, 1974], pp. 20, 25 and pls. 49B and 53B). It would be most surprising to find agricultural terracing at a small, unwalled EB settlement such as Gezer, with fertile bottomland all about, at a time when the large walled settlement at CAi (over 10 ha.) apparently did not have this technology (see n. 3 above).</page><page sequence="7">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE EAST SLOPE OF JERUSALEM 117 There are two biblical texts, both in prose, that I would relate to architectural terracing: 5. 2 Kings 23:4 mhykl yhwh 't kl hklym h'cwym lbCl wl'Prh wlkl sb himym wygrpm mhws lyrwglm bidmwt22 qdrwn (King Josiah commanded his high priest and the doorkeepers to remove) from the temple of Yahweh all the objects that had been made for Bacal, for 'Asherah, and for the whole host of heaven.

These passages provide some direction for locating the ?dmt within the Kidron Valley itself. In the seventh-early sixth century B.C. the east wall of Jerusalem (Wall NA)26 ran just inside and parallel with the "Jebusite" fortification (Wall NB) as far north as the limits of the old City of David. From there, Wall NA continued north for another 300 m, according to Kenyon's projections, until it joined the southeast corner of the Temple Mount or Platform. This extension of the fortification line was at least 25-50 m above the bottom of the Kidron Valley.27 Walking from the Temple to the south or to the east in Josiah's day, one could have been "outside Jerusalem" (i.e., outside the city wall [Wall NA]) but still on the west slope of the Kidron in a matter of minutes. In Jer. 31:38-40 the author28 "surveys" Jerusalem in counterclockwise fashion, starting at the Tower of Hananel, at the northwest corner of the Temple Mount (Neh. 3:1; 12:39; Zech. 14:10), moving west to the Corner Gate (2 Kings 14:13; 2 Chron. 26:9; Zech. 14:10), and completing his measurements on the east side at the Horse 22 Following the Lucianic recension (en 15 em- p)urismn ), A. Klostermann read mii.&lt;re6t ("burning- places") for MT .Fadmn6 (Die Biicher Samuelis und der Konige, Kurzgefasste Kommentar 3 [Nordlingen, 1887], p. 479). Gray translated Wdmt as "terraces" in Deut. 32:32 and Isa. 16:8 but substituted mi.Vre6t, ("lime kilns") in 2 Kings 23:4 because "flatplots" (sdmt) would have been "singularly inappropriate to the ravine of the Kidron below the Temple" (I &amp; II Kings, p. 730, n. c and p. 732). 23 Following qerj not k'thib, erim6t, as do most commentators and translators (see n. 12 above). 24 Reading Cal for MT cad: perhaps dittography from the Cad after Kidron (J.

In the Phoenician colonies at Carthage, Motya, Sulcis, and elsewhere a special precinct was designated as the burial ground for this type of sacrifice: human infants or animals buried in urns and marked with stelae or cippi. See, for example, my article "The Rite of Child Sacrifice at Carthage," J. G. Pedley, ed., New Light on Ancient Carthage (Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1980), pp. 1-1 i, 131-33.

This is probably the same gate referred to in Neh. 3:28 and in 2 Kings 11:16 = 2 Chron. 23:15, in the vicinity of the royal palace. Queen Athaliah was seized by the palace guard, taken through the "horses' entrance to the king's house" (2 Kings 11:16) or "into the entrance of the horse gate of the king's house" (2 Chron. 23:15), and slain there. M. Burrows has pointed out that since the horse gate "obviously led from the temple to the palace, it must have been near the SE corner of the temple enclosure, not far from the city wall but probably not a part of it.""29 If this was the case, then ?dmwt 'I (or Cd) nhl qdrwn should have been just to the south, in the vicinity of the terraced embankments discovered by Kenyon. The Kidron Valley on the east and the Ben- Hinnom Valley on the south (where child sacrifice took place-Jer. 19:1-7) were the scenes of sufficient religious activity of a non-Yahwistic sort to inspire Jeremiah's prophecy about making Jerusalem "holy to Yahweh." It was probably there, in the shadow of the Temple, that King Josiah had the cultic paraphernalia of BaCal, 'Asherah, and the "host of heaven" burned on the adm6at qidr6n.30 I would sum up the textual evidence for fdmt this way: in Ugaritic and Hebrew poetry the term is used to denote "agricultural terraces," especially those on which vineyards were planted (CTA 23:8-11; Deut. 32:32; Isa. 16:8);" but fig and olive orchards were grown on ?dmt as well (Hab. 3:17). From "agricultural terraces" the meaning was easily extended to include "architectural terraces" for buildings (and their adjacent trees and gardens), as in gadm6t qidr6n located on the slopes of the Kidron Valley, south of the Temple Mount (Jer. 31:40). Had the ladm6dt qidr6n been exclusively outside the city wall, there would have been no reason for the directive in 2 Kings 23:4 to burn the cult objects mhws lyrwilm ("outside Jerusalem"). As we have seen, Kenyon's excavations revealed several tiers of architectural terracing built inside the east slope fortification walls of Jerusalem. On the basis of 2 Kings 23:4 one could easily nullify my hypothesis by demonstrating that no Iron II terraces existed outside the walls of Jerusalem, and, therefore, sadm6t qidr6n must refer to something else. The east slope between the Temple Platform and the northeast limits of the City of David might not have been occupied until the eighth century B.C.32 Many of the 29 Burrows, IDB, p. 849; cf. J. M. Myers, Ezra- Nehemiah, The Anchor Bible, vol. 14 (Garden City, New York, 1965), p. 115. 30 M. R. Lehmann's attempt (see n. 16 above) to link ?dmt with a M6t cult has attracted more sup- porters than it deserves (Tsumura, "Ugaritic God," p. 412 and n. 51; cf. J. S. Croatto and J. A. Soggin, "Die Bedeutung von 1'1itti im Alten Testament," ZA W 74 [1962]: 44-50). Lehmann took sdmt as a compound 9d mt, meaning "field(s) of M6t," in Ugaritic, despite the fact that it appears as a single word in these texts. In 2 Kings 23:4 he read gadm6t_ as fedimat, which he derived from jedi mdwet, "fields of M6t/ Death," despite the fact that S and S' are distinguished in Hebrew. Passing over these difficulties, Lehmann reconstructed an annual rite in which members of the M6t cult buried the god- or a suitable substitute "of bodies or their ashes" (cf. Jer. 31:40)-"in the barren grounds of the Idmt for the purpose of reawakening the slain Baal" (p. 366). In Jerusalem the Kidron Valley, with its barren "fields of M6t (=Molech)," became the locus of this cult's activity. But neither the topography nor the climate of the Kidron favors the open arid fields that `edW mwt seem to require. The cultic notion was then supposedly transferred to fields that re- quired irrigation in order to produce crops (e.g., Deut. 32:32 and Isa. 16:8). 311 am grateful to Jeffrey Tigay for calling my attention to the Samaritan interpretation of msdmwt in Deut. 32:32: gw 'nb (Arabic), the plural of g nb, meaning "side" or "flank"; cf. the related word gn 'byh, meaning "curb," "embankment," "levee."

They appeared to be tombs but contained only non-human bones. Cave I in Square A XXVI (fig. 1) was filled with cultic artifacts: hundreds of broken pots, an incense stand, and 84 or more anthropomorphic and zoomorphic terracotta figurines. In addition, the cache contained a pottery rattle and miniature clay models of chairs (or thrones) and tables. Anthropomorphic figurines were abundant: 16 were pillar figurines with pendulous breasts, representing either the "mother goddess," perhaps 'Asherah, or the offerant in the desired state of lactation.34 More numerous were the animal figurines, which included a dog, birds, and horses, some with riders still attached. A few of the clay horses had a disc-shaped applique on the forehead and a mane-like projection between the ears.35 Taking the disc to represent the sun, Kenyon plausibly suggested that these miniature models might have represented the "Horses of the Sun," which Josiah had removed from the entrance to the Temple (2 Kings 23:11). The caves, then, were not tombs but .favissae for a cult center; the latest ceramic deposits dating ca. 700 B.C.36 Kenyon thought that she had located this center in a small building that stood on the same bedrock platform immediately north of the two caves. This structure was ca. 3.35 m wide and of indeterminate length (but not longer than the width of the terrace). Two monolithic pillars (ca. 1.70 m high) were still standing (ca. 1.00 m apart) near what should have been the center of the room. The floor and pillars rested on a stone fill that leveled up the bedrock terrace beneath in a manner similar to that of the earlier architectural platforms 50 m farther south (A 1-I1l and Trench 1)." Because of the small size of the building, Kenyon saw no reason to interpret the well-cut standing stones as roof supports, as she had done for similar pillars in houses farther up the slope. If the pillars were not structural, she reasoned, then they must be ceremonial, i.e., massib6t. From this analysis it followed that other features of the building and beyond should be "sacralized." A perforation in the west wall became a "symbolic doorway" (less than 30 cm wide) through which offerings could be made or libations poured anonymously in the cleft between the face of the rock scarp and the west wall, in front of, but a step below, an "altar" (a small stone feature ca. 1.00 m square and 33 Ibid., pls. 54, 56, 57. 34 In a forthcoming monograph, tentatively en- titled Hebrew Inscriptions and Israelite Religion, J. Tigay prefers the latter interpretation, because of the absence of divine attributes and the emphasis on the maternal aspects (in this case, the large breasts). He places the pillar figurines in the general category of "sympathetic-magical devices to enhance preg- nancy and lactation." W. F. Albright interpreted the "nursing mother" (dea nutrix) figurines in similar fashion (Archaeology and the Religion of Israel [Baltimore, 1956], pp. 114-15). Even if this inter- pretation is correct, it is not obvious whether a pregnant offerant living in Jerusalem at the turn of the eighth-seventh century B.c. would have appealed to a male or a female deity for help in such matters (cf. 2 Kings 23). 35 Earlier statistics for the various types of terra- cotta figurines found in Cave I have been superseded by T. A. Holland's excellent analysis of these and other Iron Age terracottas in "A Study of Palestinian Iron Age Baked Clay Figurines with Special Refer- ence to Jerusalem: Cave I," Levant 9 (1977): 121- 55. He records 149 female pillar figurines (Types A and B) from various excavations in Jerusalem, far more than at any other site in Palestine (ibid., pp. 126-27, fig. 1). 36 Kenyon, Digging, pp. 141-43 and pls. 60-61. 37 Ibid., pls. 54-56.</page><page sequence="10">120 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES two to three stones high) located on the terrace above. This whole complex, then, was one of the extramural shrines whose cult produced the artifacts buried in the favissae. Had this house been found inside the city wall and not been associated with the cave deposits, I am sure that Kenyon would have regarded it as a domestic dwelling rather than a cult center. Yet another room without pillars to the south and outside the wall was not considered a shrine. It partially blocked the entrance to Cave I.3 Both this and the pillared house-"shrine" seem to have been built after the caves were already sealed off in the late eighth-early seventh century B.C. When real massib6t have been discovered, as in the LB open-air shrine at Hazor or the Iron II sanctuary at Arad,39 they occupied the inner sanctum-the focal point of worship. In Kenyon's "shrine" the offerant would have passed through the mass0bdt (pillars) in order to pour his libation through a hole in the wall. C. F. Graesser has raised other objections to Kenyon's interpretation: not only would these be the only pair of massb6_t yet discovered in the Levant but they would also be the tallest pillars used for a cultic purpose, since the row of standing stones erected at Gezer in MB IIC.40 Graesser suggested that perhaps the structure might have been a cenotaph with the two pillars "memorializing deceased persons," but had better second thoughts when, in the next paragraph, he asked somewhat rhetorically: "Could it be that they are after all strengthening structural posts on this precarious slope like the posts higher up the slope?"41 The date of the cache in Cave I to ca. 700 B.C. probably precludes associating it with "Josiah's reformation" (2 Kings 23); besides, there was no evidence that the artifacts had been burned or intentionally damaged.42 According to the Chronicler, there was an earlier "cleansing" of the Temple under Hezekiah, at which time "unclean things" were removed from the Temple and taken to the Kidron Valley (2 Chron. 29:16). An association of the artifacts in Cave I with this event is appealing. Although the passage is set in the (editorial?) context of "purification," there is no explicit statement (as in 2 Kings 23:4) that the things removed were desecrated (cf., however, the "altars" in 2 Chron. 30:14). Regardless of who was responsible for sealing the cultic artifacts in Cave I, they appear to have been buried with the same care that other favissa deposits received.43 The pillared house and the building blocking Cave I were not isolated examples of extramural housing. Some 200-275 m farther south, Shiloh's excavations (in Areas B, D, and E) have revealed more Iron II buildings constructed on "bedrock steps" downslope from the line of the city wall.44 Upslope and inside the wall, houses were set 38 Ibid., pl. 57. 39 Y.

Holland (per- sonal communication) informs me that all of the figurines in the cache had been broken before they were deposited in Cave 1, and the missing pieces were not found. Among the more than 1500 pottery vessels in the Cave, a few were found complete, several could be mended into whole vessels, but many more sherds could not be mended. The nature and condition of these finds clearly indicate that Cave I was a favissa. 43 Ibid. 44 Shiloh, "Jerusalem, the City of David, 1980" in "Notes and News," IEJ 30 (1980): 220 and pl. 28B; idem, "The City of David Archaeological Project: The Third Season, 1980," BA 44 (1981): 165 (right photograph); idem, "City of David: Excavation 1978," BA 42 (1979): 169.</page><page sequence="11">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE EAST SLOPE OF JERUSALEM 121 on built stone terraces. Outside the wall, where there had been no earlier constructional debris, houses were built on the exposed bedrock, which had been quarried into tiers of level platforms for this new suburb on the slope. This area even had a water tunnel/channel (the "Siloam Channel" = Channel II) with apertures in its outer wall for irrigating gardens and orchards on the lower slope and in the valley below.45 In the eighth-seventh centuries B.C. Jerusalem rapidly expanded to four times its former size. A large suburb (probably the misneh, or "second quarter," mentioned in 2 Kings 22:14), sprang up on the western hill and was incorporated behind the massive fortifications of Jerusalem, a city that then occupied 50-60 ha. and included 10,000- 12,000 inhabitants within its walls.46 M. Broshi has cogently connected the expansion of Jerusalem with the influx of new immigrants: first, from the northern kingdom, after Samaria fell to the Assyrians; later, from the countryside of Judah, following the predations of Sennacherib and the subsequent takeover of several Judahite settlements by the Philistines.47 These population pressures must have contributed to the eastward expansion of Jerusalem and to the sprawl of housing beyond its walls and onto the lower terraces of the Kidron Valley. If I have succeeded in locating the sadm6dt qidr6n in the long stretch of stone-built and rock-cut terraces excavated by Kenyon and Shiloh on the west flank of the Kidron, then we are still left with the problem of milI . Kenyon's excavations have bracketed the problem spatially. Temporally there is now no need to look to a period earlier than Solomon's extension of the City of David to the north to join up with the royal acropolis.48 Somewhere in the gap between those two hills the great "filling" might one day be found. 45 Idem, "Jerusalem, the City of David, 1979," in "Notes and News," IEJ 29 (1979): 244-45; BA 42 (1979): 168 and 170 (photograph).

Broshi, "The Expansion of Jerusalem in the Reigns of Hezekiah and Manasseh," IEJ 24 (1974): 21-26. My only quarrel with Broshi, in what is otherwise an admirable essay, is over his inflated estimate of the population of Jerusalem for this period. Following H. Frankfort's density quotient of 400-500 people per ha., Broshi settles on a figure of 24,000 for the aggregate population living within the city walls. According to J. C. Russell, Rome, during the height of Augustan glory, did not have a density of more than 250-350 people per ha. Its inhabitants lived in large, multi-storied apartment houses. First-century Rome must have had much more densely settled residential quarters than "low-rise" Jerusalem had in the time of Hezekiah and Manasseh.
