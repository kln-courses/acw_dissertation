<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. On Spinozistic Immortalit,y. By GEORGE STUART FULLERTON, Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy in the University of Pennsyl. vania. Publications of the University of Pennsylvania; No. 2 of the ' Series in Philosophy'. Philadelphia, 1899. Pp. v., 154. Price 4s. THE main object of this monograph is to examine the " Eternity " which Spinoza ascribes to the human mind. " I have endeavoured," the author says, " to set forth as clearly as possible Spinoza's doctrine of existences and essences and of the passage of the soul from the world of perishable things to that of things imperishable and eternal " (Preface). Part iv. contains a discussion of "the religious element in Spinoza ". In spite of much that is interesting-e.g., the careful analysis in part iii. of Spinoza's use of the terms " Essence " and " Eternity "-I cannot think that Prof. Fullerton is very successful in his interpretation. The fundamental mistake of the book, as it seems to me, is that Spinoza is not taken literally enough. Thus, when Spinoza (in the Tractatus de Intellectus emendatione) describes the infinite being as " omne esse, prweter quod nullum datur esse," our author understands this as " the sum-total of being " (p. 37), " the sum of being " (p. 41), " the sum-total of existing things " (p. 128). Consequently, one is not surprised to find him assum- ing that (for Spinoza) the " concrete reality" is the world of actually existent finite things-the everyday world of the uncritical consciousness: that for Spinoza (cf. e.g. p. 23) " the corporeal world consists of a limit- less congeries of finite individual things," and that " each thing in the corporeal world has its corresponding idea in the world of thought In other words, the ' bodies' and ' minds,' the "things " and "individuals" of the uncritical (" Imaginative") consciousness, are supposed to be for Spinoza's Metaphysics self-dependent realities. Starting from such an assumption, Prof. Fullerton naturally regards Spinoza's " God," " Extension " and " Thought " as abstracted from the concrete things, bodies and ideas. They are " abstract universals," which Spinoza-thorough-paced "Realist" that he is (p. 33)-inconsistently individualises, treats as real or concrete (cf. e.g. pp. 38 ff., 52). It is not worth while to labour this point, For Spinoza as I understand him, ' God,' the ' Universe,' the ' Absolute '-or whatever term may be preferred-is the only completely real thing, the only concrete, individual and self-dependent reality. Finite things-so-called 'individual' men, bodies and minds-are, quad finite and qua distinct things, in varying degrees unreal: whilst, so far as they are real, they are states or modes of the one Individual, God. For Spinoza as Prof. Fullerton understands him these ' finite things' are " concrete realities," all equally and fully real. And the Attributes and Substance are universal concepts abstracted from these real things, which yet-by a confusion characteristic of Real- ists-Spinoza regards as somehow 'real' and therefore ' individual'. A critic who approaches Spiboza in this spirit-however careful his</page><page sequence="2">268 NE W BOOKS. analysis may be in detail--is bound to misunderstand him. Thus-to take only one instance-the whole of Spinoza's Theory of Knowledge (cf. the outline criticism of its principles, pp. 19, 20) becomes confusion for Prof. Fullerton, simply because he treats the human mind as a self- dependent individual: whilst Spinoza regards it as a mode of God's thinking, which is always to some extent dependent upon the other thoughts which form its context-i.e. alwavs, qua individual mind, to some extent (more or less) unreal. Curiously enough, Prof. Fullerton refers to Ethics, ii., 17 Schol., as a passage, in which Spinoza " explicitly recognises " that "he uses the word 'idea' in two distinct senses," and shows by speaking " hesitatingly and indefinitely " that he " never clearly worked out the implications of his own assumptions ". Yet this very passage, if read attentively in connexion with Spinoza's account of Ima- ginatio, disposes of the theory of an ambiguity in his use of the term 'idea'. We shall all agree (cf. Preface and ? 25) that it is wrong to read modern Philosophy into Spinoza-except in so far as it is to be found there already. But then neither ought the Logic of Abstract Identity to be thrust upon Spinoza (cf. ? 8 and passim), unless Prof. Fullerton can produce some evidence to show that it is Spinoza's as well as his own. Nor would students of Spinoza desire-any more than Prof. Fullerton (? 28)-to " confuse his philosophical doctrine . . . with other beliefs " which he may have held and " which are either disconnected with or even contradictory to the doctrine in question ". But I hardly think they will readily accept Prof. Fullerton's exposition as Spinoza's " philo- sophical doctrine ". With regard to part iv., the author at first (p. 116) proposes to include under the word 'religious' "those things that most of my readers, familiar as they are with the history of theological doctrine and philo- sophical speculation, will on reflexion be inclined to include under it ". This is bewildering: but at page 129 we learn that the author thinks that " the history of human thought justifies " him " in refusing to apply " the word ' religious ' "to any philosophy, which, while retaining, perhaps, the word God, has divested the corresponding conception of every shred of anthropomorphic reference ". Surely, if that is so, there was no need to waste space in proving that the Spinozistic conception of God is not " religious ". If to be 'religious' involves what Prof. Fullerton says, it is an unjust slur on Spinoza's honesty to accuse him of being 'religious' himself, and there was no need formally to acquit his system of the charge (p. 153). The translation in the book is on the whole accurate and good: but I have inoticed two slips. " Mentis oculi ... sunt ipsme demonstrationes" does not mean " the eyes of the mind . . . are themselves proofs " (p. 76) nor is "they could not help finding a few harmful things " an exact rendering of -" non pauca reperire debuerunt incommoda " (p. 132). HAROLD H. JOACHIM. A Primer of Psychology. By EDWARD BRADFORD TITCHENER. New York: The Macmillan Company; London: Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., 1898. Pp. xvi., 314. To write a primer of Psychology is an arduous undertaking, and to write it in such a way as to give general satisfaction to psychologists is prob- ably impossible. The public for whom such a work is intended require an exposition which shall be throughout compact, clear-cut, and trans- parent. To introduce reservations and argumentative discussions is to</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 269 imperil success so far as they are concerned. On the other hand, Psy- chology is at present in a transitional state, and this makes it difficult for the psychologist to reach a compact and clear-cut outline of his subject without some degree of mental friction. He cannot help disagreeing tore or less even on important questions, and he can scarcely help feeling a certain amount of irritation at seeing the law laid down on such points in the dogmatic way which is necessary in a primer. I, for instance, feel a disposition to quarrel with Prof. Titchener's pro- cedure in many respects. When he impresses on the mind of the learner the view that the mind is a " sum of processes " I recognise of course that he is relatively justified as against oertain other views which we both hold to be erroneous. But I feel strongly that the statement ought to be modified and supplemented. I myself should have included in the definition not only actual conscious processes but the whole system of permanent possibilities of conscious process, which are called mental capacities, powers, dispositions, etc. I should also have expounded at some length the peculiar nature of the unity and continuity of conscious process which prevent mind from being a mere Heraclitean flux. Again, Prof. Titchener throughout his book assumes the presence of free repro- duction of ideas at every stage of mrental development. The free rein- statement of qualitatively identifiable copies of sensation complexes is regarded by him as the most primitive form of reproduction-the essential condition of learning by experience. I on the contrary hold that past experience may mould and shape practical adjustment to a present situation without recall of ideal images, and I hold that this may and does happen as a primary process and not merely as the result of the dropping out of ideal links which have previously existed. This is not the place to argue such points with Prof. Titchener. The fairer course is to consider his work from a different point of view. In the first place we have to ask, Will the reader for whom the book is in- tended derive substantial benefit from it? I have no hesitation in answering this question by an emphatic affirmative. The reader for whom the book is specially intended and others for whom it is not speci- ally intended may derive from it a substantial body of knowledge and a real increase of clearness and insight. If they fail to do so, it will not ,be the fault of the author. For systematic lucidity and easy mastery of exposition, Prof. Titchener's book has no rival on its own ground. If primers of Psychology are to be written (and I think they should be) he is certainly the man to do it. In conclusion I would draw attention to the feature of Prof. Titchener's work which is likely to contribute very greatly to its usefulness. I refer to the " Questions and Exercises " appended to each chapter. These are drawn up with admirable judgment and ingenuity. The student who works throhugh them seriously and strenuously cannot fail to acquire real psychological power and insight. Prof. Titchener is to be congratulated on his skilful performance of a difficult task. G. F. S. Mental Affections: An Introduction to the Study of Insanity. By JOHN MACPHERSON, M.D., F.R.C.P.E. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd.; New York: the Macmillan Company, 1899. Pp. x., 380. Dr. John MacPherson's Mental Afflections is intended to be "an intro- duetion to the study of insanity'". It is this and more. The book is ciaborated from Lectures, which obviously aimed at two things mainly-</page><page sequence="4">270 NEW BOOKS. a point of view and a description adequate for clinical practice. The "point of view" shows a decided advance on some good text-books ; but the treatment of it is still hampered with a good deal of traditional baggage. The central concept is the functionally composite character of the nervous system, which is a system of systems, the possible dissociation of systems, and the corresponding dissociation of the parallel mental systems. These latter include the "unconscious mind," to which Dr. MacPherson gives great prominence. One regrets that he should draw so much on a metaphysical work like Von Hartmann's when so much well-wrought psychology is available in (say) Janet, or Ribot; for he is ceitainly led into much that has no direct bearing on the concrete prob- len s of the insanities. Then, in dealing with " association of ideas," one naturally expects an author to have regard to the latest criticism of cate- gories, as presented, for example, in Hoffding or Dr. Stout's Psychology. Th tt would have saved the author from speaking of the "contest of idetts " in terms like-" it is certain that only one idea can be present in consciousness at a time; but a struggle between abstractions is absurd and inconceivable" (p. 115). Many similar propositions are open to criticism; but for practical purposes the chapter is good. On the physical side, Dr. MacPherson emphasises the neuron as the functional unit, which, in its varieties of excitability and blocked resistances, suggests an easy formula for many orders of insanity. The hierarchical character of the nervous system is not forgotten; buit it is not made as prominent as its importance warrants. It is puzzling to see why the book begins with heredity, and the causes of insanity. Here, I think, the author yields needlessly to traditional exposition. He does not take up very decisive ground on the heredity or non-heredity of acquired characters. He emphasises the " transmutation of neuroses " in heredity, so indicating a leaning to Weismann's view. Then as to classification, the author no more than other authors succeeds perfectly in systematising the insanities; but his excellent exposition of the toxic insanities certainly achieves something of system. His " insanity of the degenerate " is also a justifi- able and well-worked-out section. Had he begun with his exposition of the psycho-physical parallelism-lamination, centres, neurons, dissociation he would have been better able to exhibit the " causes of insanity " as operating on a known organisation and so originating the "forms" of insanity. Then he could have classified the clinical insanities to suit the purposes of practice. But, with all deductions, the book remains a solid presentment of the leading facts of alienism on its practical side. W. LESLIE MACKENZIE. Institutes of Education. By S. S. LAURIE. Second Edition. Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd. Pp. This volume contains in a summarised form the matter of an important section of the author's class lectures. Those who agree with Mr. Sidg- wick's protest against the lecturing system at our universities will welcome the book as a step in the direction of reform. It is to be hoped that the professor's colleagues will soon follow his example: dictation is a somewhat elementary exercise for university students. On the other hand, what is good for the students is not perhaps equally good for the book. It necessarily bears traces of its origin; and indicates its purpose by a more than usually elaborate arrangement. There are too many divisions and subdivisions for those who have no examination in view. But students will appreciate the careful classification, while general readers will take pleasure in notifig the skill with which the writer keeps</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 271 steadily in view the essential unity of the subject. For Prof. Laurie claims to have established an unbroken chain of rational interdependence from his first principles to his ultimate rules and applications. The contrast between the attuitional and rational planes is made to produce valuable applications; and the exclusion of memory and imagination from the " dynamic process of mind as such," gets rid of much of the confusion that the usual classification of those modes of being conscious involves. The practical identification of reason and will is at first startling, but after all we see no cause to refuse our author's invitation when he begs us " to go deeper down and see in Will the root, possibility and essence of this very endowment which in its fulness, that is to say, as including the form in which it moves to its end, viz., knowing and willing, is called Reason " (p. 117). We doubt, all the same, whether he would be willing to let us make a general application of this system of Concept-interpretation, after the manner of Prof. James. It is in- teresting to note that though Prof. Laurie has adopted a new principle, and has followed entirely his own method, he has reached a body of sound doctrine in education which cannot fail to commend itself to all experts in that subject.

These works are severely practical in character. Only in the last, and there only in an appendix, do we find a theory: the theory of an astral fluid, respired by the heavenly bodies, and absorbed by the Pacinian corpuscles of the human hand. Apart from this contribution to philo- sophy, the significance of the books lies in their existence and selling power. As indices of the present state of folk-psychology in a civilised nation, they may find mention in a psychological journal.

Veitch's " Introduction " is omitted, and a preface written in popular terms by T. J. McCormack substituted for it. The book is well printed, and should prove extremely useful.- The reprint of De Morgan's Illustrcations has been reparagraphed, fur- nished with descriptive sub-headings, and carefully indexed. - Miss Frances Welby's translation of Ribot's General Ideas is accurate and readable.-Mr. Stanley's Psychology deals cursorily with the definition of psychology, knowing (sensation and perception, memory, ideation and introspection), feeling and will, ahd ' special' psychology. The essay</page><page sequence="6">272 NEW BOOKS. reads easily and fluently. Unfortunately, the writer has not grasped the fact that the ' sensation' of experimental psychology is not the knowing- atom that it is in associationismn; and accordingly burdens his text with a number of wholly irrelevant details. Social Laws: an Outline of Sociology. By G. TARDE. Translated by H. C. WARREN, with a preface by J. M. BALDWIN. New York and London: The Macmillan Co., 1899. Pp. xi., 213. Price, $1.25; 6s. This is a good translation of a brilliant little book. It should, however, have been indexed; and we regret to see that Prof. Baldwin has con- sented, even "on the insistent request of the publishers," to help perpetuate an unworthy custom. The 1glernents of Vital Statistics. By A. NEWSHOLME. Third edition. London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1899. Pp. xii., 353. We are glad, in days when the biological and psychological sciences are making such wide use of the statistical method, to call attention to the new edition of this sound and wholesome book. Dr. Newsholme's third edition is, in fact, almost a new work. Fewer English tables are given; a number of foreign ones have been introduced; and the exact method of construction of a life-table is shown in detail. The chapters deal with population, births and deaths, disease, marriage, mortality in relation to age, climate and occupation, duration of life, statistical fallacies, etc. Syl1labms of Psychology. By J. H. HYSLoP. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1899. Pp. 116. Price, $1.00. This number of the " Columbia University Contributions " contains abstracts of ten chapters upon psychological topics, entitled " Introduc- tion," "The Conditions of Consciousness," "Sensation," "The Special Senses," " Consciousness and Attention," " Memory," " Apprehension or Intuition," " Thought or Ideation," " Emotion," and " The Will or Cona- tion ". The syllabus " has been designed solely as a time-saving instru- ment in " the writer's " lectures on the subject, and as a guide to" his " students in their readmg and study ". The references are only to "the current and most important English works on the subject of Psychology " (James, Baldwin, Dewey, Hoffding (!), Titchener, Ladd, Stout, Sully, Hamilton). In offering the syllabus to the general public, as well as to his classes, the author invites criticism upon his work. While it is difficult to criticise a series of propositions which must, from the nature of the case, be tLhrown into dogmatic and more or less aphoristic form, it may be said without fear of unfairness that the syllabus does not -present a coherent system of psychology, still less a system of modern psychology. It may be said, further, that the compilation has been carelessly done: witness the remark, " See any work on the subject of Consciousness " (p. 11);" Brain, Senses and Intellect (p. 18); " McKindrick " (p. 19); the assumption of the validity of Weber's law for temperature, with the fraction X (p. 26); the size of the finger-tip sensory circle given as "2 m." (p. 27); constant references to the " Philosophic Review"; "two instruments, which function, however, has one organ " (p. 30); and so throughout. We rejoice to strike a few references to the sources as we read on; but what shall we say of " Helmholtz, Physiologische Optik, pp. 692-695 (First Edition) " (p. 72) 2 We doubt whether the syllabus, as it stands, will not waste as much time as it is intended to save.</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 2-73 L'Etre Suboonscient. Par Docteur E. GYEL. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1899. Pp. 191. This book, thoiagh intended for serious students, will have considerable attraction for the general reader. It is short, systematically arranged, and written with great clearness. It contains accounts of some striking cases of multiple personality, thougllt-transference, etc. It asserts the necessity of regarding force, intelligence, and matter as forms of the single principle of the universe, touches on the miseries of life and the desire for immortality, and declares that only the scientific explanation of fa.cts can lead the way to a philosophy that will satisfy mankind. Dr. Gyel's main object is to explain what he understands by the sub- conscious being and by its power of " exteriorisation " or manifestation of itself apart from the physical organism of the conscious being, and to show how this hypothesis throws light on facts which are left unexplained by the hypothesis that mind is a function of the brain. The subconscious being coexists with the normal conscious being, and can act, perceive and think independently of the muscles, the organs of sense and the brain. It has a substratum of homogeneous fluid sub- stance, which is inaccessible to the normal senses, can pass through solid objects, and can be in part projected to a great distance. By the action of the subconscious will it can be caused to assume different forms; and in the process of exteriorisation, which takes place in the trances of mediums or in the sleep of hypnotic subjects, it may take organic molecules with it. Its knowledge is partially acquired through the normal senses, either consciously or not, and partially by means which cannot be normal. It is reasonable to suppose that all subconscious psychical elements have been conscious psychical elements. But we find the subconscious being displaying knowledge which we know to have been inaccessible to the conscious being. Such cases can be explained on the hypothesis that the subconscious being is the " synthetic product of a series of successive consciousnesses," each of which ends with the death of a human organ- ism. Dr. Gyel illustrates his argument by referring in footnotes to various cases of abnormal manifestations. These are taken from Azam's Hypno- tismne et double Conscience, Rochas' Exteriorisation de la Sensibilit, Aksakof's Animisme et Spiritisme, the Annales des Sciences Psychiques and other sources. " Lucidity," or the faculty of acquiring exact know- ledge without the help of the normal senses and without thought-reading, generally occurs in a state of hypnotic sleep. The subconscious being is active, the sensibility is exteriorised, and the hypnotic subject "' sees " or "hears " at a great distance. Sleep is, physiologically, a resting of the nervous centres; but the diminution of functional activity does not ex- plain the psychology of sleep. But if there is a subconscious being inde- pendent of the brain, logical and coherent dreams present no difficulty. There is no satisfactory physiological explanation of hysteria. Dr. Gyel suggests that it is due to defective subconscious direction, which may be caused in various ways. The external influence of circumstances and education on the conscious being may be too strong. The organism may be complicated and the subconscious being not sufficiently developed to know how to use it. Or the subconscious being may be too highly developed and consequently forced to struggle with an organism too coarse for its purposes. Again, the existence of a subconscious being would account for the permanence of personality amid nolecular changes. The most difficult part of the theory is the relation between conscious- ness and subconsciouisness. The one is transient personality, the other, enduring individuality. The part of consciousness is to enrich subcon- 18</page><page sequence="8">274 NEW BOOKS. sciousness, which stores up and synthetises the acquisitions of the senses. Subconsciousness "is, for the most part, independent of the normal will and consciousness" (p. 129), and hence it is difficult to determine where it begins and ends; but it exercises a general guidance in the manifesta- tions of consciousness, and may be supposed to know and influence consciousness without being known by it. The subconscious being furnishes the conscious being with innate faculties and predispositions, and adapts these as far as possible to the organic conditions, for the development of the conscious being; and, since it evidently has some power of directing matter, may have some share in the development of the organism. All this is very vague; but Dr. Gyel is not attempting to prove any- thing, but merely to show what deductions might be made from his, hypothesis, if true, and how it would solve the problems of normal and abnormal psychology. And he adds that it would do more than that. If the personality that exists from birth to death is transient, if individu- ality endures and advances through successive incarnations, if 'ultimate happiness is attained by the observance of moral law, man is set free from the false principles of authority and social justice, assured of im- mortality and provided, by his belief in the progress of humanity through the free efforts of individuals, with an adequate mnotive for conduct. E. F. STEVENSON. Esquisse d'un Enseignement base sur la Psychologie de l'enfant. By PAUL LACOMBE. Paris: Armand Colin et Cie. The brilliant epigrammatic style of this little book must not distract our attention from the solid common sense with which the whole subject is treated. No doubt educational heresies are so common now that M. Lacombe is much less out of the rut than he thinks he is; yet his revolt against the fonctionnaire way of regarding education is none too common in France where such a revolt is urgently called for. The existing system would do admirably if only the pupil were not a child, and " s'il etait en bas age un estimable professeur de l'Universite ". Against the present dogmatic instruction our author recommends what he calls dialectic, instruction. This new method corresponds in everything but name with the method rising into favour in all quarters and usually labelled as heuristic. M. Lacombe is, however, more thorough than most supporters. of this method. His view of a teacher is not " en homme qui, sachant tout, enseigne tout, mais en homme qui aide a apprendre tout ce qu'on veut savoir ". If a child wants to know about bookbinding, let the teacher take him to a bookbinder's. The Psychology upon which the enseignem,ent is based naturally interests us here. We have no objection to the limitaStion of our forces over the child to the three levers, curiosity, imiitation and amour propre. We even admire the epigrammatic use of his " la moutonnerie des enfants ". But on pages 71 and 72 we find a theory sketched out which surely deserves fuller treatment. All formal logic is based upon the assumption that the processes of mind are the same no matter what the subject upon which the mind acts. Without a word of apology to the author -bf the Outlines of the Laws of Thought M. La- combe tells us that the intellectual operations differ with the subject,, and concludes his paragraph with the pregnant words: " A l'enfant qui demeurerait tout X fait ignorant de l'une de ces maitresses branches du savoir humain, il manquerait l'idee de l'un des procedes qui composent la raison humaine ". He meets the educational difficulty by suggesting typical forms to illustrate all the different processes, but we cannot help</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 275 feeling that the psychological foundation is a little too easily gained to be quite secure. Another example of a serious difficulty summarily dismissed is to be found in the footnote on page 203. Whatever may be said of his premises, M. Lacombe carries them logically to practical and useful conclusions. Psychologische Untersuchungen ueber das Lesen. Von BENNO ERDMANN und RAYMOND DODGE. Halle: Max Niemeyer, 1898. Pp. viii., 360. As its title implies, this book gives a rgsum6 of the works on reading that appeared prior to 1896, and records the results of additional expdriments on new or disputed points. The volume begins with a summary of the preceding discussions, having particular reference to the controversy between the alienists as to whether reading is by letters or entire words. This serves to introduce the treatment of the problem as a whole. The first phase of the question that the authors consider on their own account, and the one to which they contribute most new material, is as to the part played by eye movements and pauses in reading. The funda- mental question in this connexion has regard to the number and conditions of the pauses that are mnade in reading a line. The conditions fall into two classes. The first, the merely physiological, are to be found in the size of the field of clear vision; the second are furnished by supplementing in terms of context. The distance of each eye movement is about one half of the diameter of the field of clear vision, but varies with the part of the line, and with the degree of familiarity with language, subject matter, and text. It is less for proof-reading than for ordinary reading (reading for the meaning). In general, it can be said that the pauses in eye-movements are most frequent when context helps least. Chapters iii.-viii. are devoted to a discussion of the question of the nature of reading, whether by words or separate letters, and the problems that Wundt has treated under the head of 'the range of attention'. The authors constructed a new instrument, which is a combination of the revolving disk of Goldscheider and Miiller and the projection apparatus of Scripture. It consisted, essentially, of a camera with a revolving disk before the lens. The length of the exposure is- controlled by adjusting a radial slit in the disk. They assert that it possesses the advantages of great accurracy and of binocular adaptation. Wundt I has called attention,, in his recent criticism, to the fact that the great accuracy for small time intervals is of little or no value, because of the long latent period of the retina, and that the Helmholtz and Cattell instruments both permit the use of the two eyes. The results obtained confirm that of Cattell, that four or five letters can be seen.with a single exposure, and that four or five times as miany letters can be read, if they are grouped in familiar words. In this field, too, two factors are to be distinguished. The one is, again, the physio- logical range of clear vision; the other, the apperceptive factors. With discrete letters, not all that are within the limit of the field of clear vision can be read, i.e., come into consciousness; while when the letters are grouped in words, more. letters can be read than can be clearly seen. That is, letters that extended beyond the field were read, and'words could be read that were so far away that the separate letters could not be seen. Moreover, in connected sentences less than a line in length, words could be read that fell entirely without the field of clear vision. In view of these facts and the errors that are made in reading indistinct 'Phil. Stud., vol. xv., p. 287.</page><page sequence="10">276 NEW BOOKS. words, the conclusion is reached that reading is in terms of the general form of the word rather than of the separate letters. The rough form of the letters, and the letters clearly seen, work together and mutually correct each other in the reading process. Where the form is ambiguous, the letters determine the way in which the word is read; and the form determines, where the letters clearly seen are ambiguous. In no case, however, is there an optical spelling-through of the word. Again, there can be no letter-by-letter translation from the optical element to the auditory element, for the sounds do not run pArallel to the letters. On the whole, the results justify the assertion that reading is always by words, and never primarily by letters. The last two chapters of the book are devoted to a discussion of the reaction times that enter into the reading process. First under this head there is a long critique of the method of deducing the psychical timres employed by Cattell. The examination results in a rejection of the divisions of the earlier workers, as based upon insufficient data. New principles are suggested in their place, but even these are not considered as entirely trustworthy. In their own results, the authors are content to give the uncorrected total times, and make no attempt to allot their due proportions to the different constituent processes. The results of the experiments in this department, too, go to support the miain contention. It is fouind that a word of four letters can be recognised more quickly than a single letter, and that the time gradually rises for eight, twelve and sixteen letter words. There is little criticism to be passed upon the work. It might be objected that the authors have devoted too much attention to the physio- logical and external factors in reading, to the exclusion of the more subjective or apperceptive factors: but that does not affect the value of their results. The treatise, as a whole, is a model of patient work. The writers have erred, where they have erred at all, on the side of too great care. In some cases, they have laid themselves open to the charge, of thoroughness for the mere sake of thoroughness, without reference to the end to be accomplished. There is also a suggestion at times of verbosity in the explanations: but we can forgive them all this for the pleasure of feeling that, in this day of concentration, some have been able to write without considering limitations of space. Although the conclusions of the book hardly do more than confirm the results of earlier investigations, it is an advantage to have the material brought together -in a convenient form. W. B.

Ueber die ausserhalb der Schule liegendem Ursachen der Nervositdt der Kinder. Von Prof. Dr. A. CRAMER. Berlin: Reuther &amp; Reichard, 1899; London: Williams &amp; Norgate, Pp. 28. Price 9d. net. The process of association as regards adults has been studied experi- mentally by various psychologists. Prof. Ziehen, himself a prominent associationist, is now engaged in association experiments with children. In the present contribution he selects for discussion the nature of the trend of ideas when a given idea is presented. In essays yet to follow he intends to investigate the child's store of ideas, the velocity of, its ideational movements, and the course and rapidity of association under special conditions. The children experimented with were exclusively boys, about forty-five in number,^ between the ages of eight and fourteen,</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 277 of lower middle class standing, and belonging to the Serninarschule in Jena. All the experiments were conducted in one and the same room, almost all between 9 and 11 A.M., and lasted not longer than twenty minutes. It was generally sufficient to say to the child " Tell me what occurs to you first ". The initial idea was suggested verbally, and was chosen at random, e.g., one series begins "ship, gold, bed, green, bad, ink, freedom, grey, flesh, butterfly, similar ". The nature of the replies varies. Some children tend to explain the word; some take refuge in alliteration, rhyme, or other verbal similarities; and some follow the suggestions of close relationship (as horse-carriage, cat-mouse, bread- butter, Christmas-nuts). The mass of the answers, however, cannot be traced so largely as in adults to persisting associations. Here is a good sample from a boy nearly eleven years old: " red-yellow, Jena-Weimar, sun-moon, water-fish, yellow-money, donkey-horse, coachman-coach, white-black, school-children, table-chairs, book-school, exercise book- children, stick-man, black-white, house-wall," etc., etc. Prof. Ziehen thinks it unquestionable that children, between eight and fourteen, are more pronounced visuals than adults. The origin of the associations our author traces to two sources--contiguity and feeling tone; pure and undisputable associations by similarity he has never observed. Lastly, he thinks that association inquiries offer valuable hints to teachers as to the individuality and capacity of children. This scanty outline misses of necessity several points of importance. The task which Prof. Ziehen has set to himself and which he has so conscientiotisly performed opens a field of inquiry that is certain to attract many to its cultivation. What strikes one, on the negative side, is the artificiality and cramped scope of these experiments. Children, like adults, are normally immersed in a topic, in a system of thought, and hence normal association, unlike what lies before us for review, is systematic. Is it, then, safe to deduce from such premisses conclusions as to regular thinking? Again, we should like to see the initial ideas varied. Let the same word be given re- peatedly; let words of one class be chosen; let words such as "that, him, how, not " be selected; let a number of associations be demanded; in fine, let the normal process of association be examined. To us it seems that the mechanical or quantitative standpoint should be replaced by a more many-sided, comprehensive, and freer method, much like that which is employed in the physical sciences generally. Prof. Cramer's analysis of those causes of nervousness in children which lie outside the school, is admirable. He takes a very sane view of the whole subject. He holds that nervousness is not a disease in the strict sense, and that it can often be prevented or cured. He protests against the growing literature on Degeneration which produces what it is sup- posed to combat. He significantly points out that the presence of nervousness in a family is of limited importance, since half of those who are untainted have tainted relatives. He divides the causes into endo- genous and exogenous. Among the former he specially considers heredity, direct (father or mother) and indirect (more distant relatives). Among the latter he enumerates a large variety of factors, e.g., neglect, poverty, pampering, ignorance. HIe insists that children should not be artificially stimulated during illness and convalescence; that parents should not be too eager as to the progress of their children at school; and that corporal punishment, which is now dispensed with in madhouses and criminal establishments, should not be administered in the home. On the whole, Prof. Cramer regards the roots of nervousness as being widespread; but he thinks that intelligent treatment may reduce the evil to a minimumn. The pamphlet is to be recommended to parents and teachers. GUSTAV SPILLER.</page><page sequence="12">278 NEW BOOKS. Die Spiele der Menschen. Von KARL GROOS. Jena: Gustav Fischer; London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1899. Pp. iv., 526. This work is marked by the same qualities and is written from the same point of view as the author's Spiele der Thiere. It is divided into two parts. The first, comprising 464 pages, is devoted to a detailed account of the various forms of human play. An imposing mass of material is utilised, drawn partly from observations of children and partly from anthropological sources. In classifying the forms of play, the author makes a broad division between those by which the individual obtains mastery over his own psychophysical organism and those in which his relation to other individuals is a prominent feature, so that they serve to educate him in social behaviour. Under the first head are brought the playful exercise of the "sensory apparatus," of the " motor appara- tus," and of the higher mental capacities. Under the second head are brought plays of competition and conflict, love plays, imitative plays anld social plays (in a more special sense). The second part of the book is entitled " Theory of Play ". It discusses the nature and function of play from various points of view: physiological, biological, psychological, aesthetic, sociological and pandagogic. Full critical notice will follow.
