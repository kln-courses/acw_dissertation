<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAM NORTH THE AUTOMATIC MAN October 30 I've been searching for a face. Everyone passing by gets a good scrutiny now. D'you ever try and turn your own eyeballs into magnets, in the hope of catching someone? Don't do it. I caught sight of myself in the Tesco window and I looked merely desperate, if not repellent. But over and over I have failed to recognise that person, trap them, or win them. I do such things because I have been indulging too long in private. And why's all this privacy happened in the first place? Because of a predicament I find myself in. There are breaks in the time that we get to run along our own lifespan, when we fiddle messily with a bit of toast, and don't give a damn about the plate or the knife or the jam sticking to the table. That's where I am now: most of my hours seem to pass me by. I can be pressed close enough to people to see the grain in their skins and still comes the mournful thought that they're of a different species. So worked over by the Original Incident that everyone seems impossibly far away. I want my head held. I want someone who knows exactly how to do it, tight, with their open hands moving over the surface of my hotbrain, and I will relax, breath by breath, and hide my face in the soft corner of their neck while they continue to press and stroke my brow. 76</page><page sequence="2">Sam North (Fingers still cold from the latest dawdle on the balcony. That little jutting slab of concrete is the coldest place in the world.) It is unconscionable to think that while I'm waiting this person exists. She (it will be a female) is walking around, unknowing, carried along until the umpteen millionth intersec tion of Time and Space brings us together. But I need her now. I can't wait. If only I could tweak fate, or reach into her head and guide us into a start. To set it up from this anonymous distance, I'd begin by planting an episode into her head. It's not that I want to hurt her, I just want to share my own hurt, I want her to take some of it off me, just by understanding. I'll fill her darkest insides with this, putting her through it to make it stick. The opening scene is this room with me as the sole occupant. I'd take her up close so she'll know me again: a man aged twenty-two with sallow skin arranged loosely around a collec tion of unremarkable features, framed by hair hanging in long curves. The topmost line of my eye turns down at the outer end, making me look starved. My eyes are black and set quite close at the top of my nose. My nose curves in the Roman style. I'm of medium height and on the thin side. Hair runs a course up my middle, spreading to the sparse fan on my chest. In that Shortest Possible Glance you'd give me if we passed in the street, you would say, 'Frenchman' or 'Bistro chef.' Her first task is to get me out of the front door. She'd have to use both hands and march me into the corridor, she might need to shout, 'No complaints! Just do what I say!' She'd be looking down the tunnel towards the front door. It's gloomy, but at the end there is one pin-prick of light. A spyhole. I'd complain, and point, 'Look through the spyhole!' We walk down the corridor and she'd press her eye to the cold surface. We all know those wide-angle scenes, curled to fit in the circle of your view. I'd ask her to swear that there's no-one there, so she'd tell me, 'No-one.' 77</page><page sequence="3">Mississippi Review I'll slip the locks on her memory, continue inserting this important log. On we go, opening the front door by turning the Chubb key, and then the Yale. Both locks are brand new. She'd have to learn to notice these things, to feel the quality of the mecha nisms. My locks move smoothly. Solid, and sounding like they're dumb (they don't know my secrets but they have a duty to safeguard them). Don't like going through that door ... Talking to her right now, it's charmed me. Wherever she is she won't know that I'm here, hanging loops of words in her head, but I'll persist. 'Outside, you're suddenly in no-man's land. These shared concrete stairwells. Used to funnel the mass of the public to their front doors. There are hundreds of them. We'll be passing a few. Old men patiently fit new locks: top, bottom and middle. A rubbish chute on the first landing. Even the trash gets executed. We're walking past. These stairs go on ... count ten flights.' I'm sorry for what I am about to do, but it's for a reason: so we can meet on a sound footing. 'Now we're outside and walking, it's not going to take too long. Friends?' The sky opens when you walk out of the block. No more just the colour of the window, it's the real thing, with depth, like on my balcony. All the other blocks are there as usual, defying the sky. Hundreds of flats are arranged in the cheapest way pos sible. It's all been worked out on paper, each flat the same. Us people trot along dotted lines, the compartments in our minds are designed to shrink so we fit. Outside the front gates of the estate we'd turn left, walk alongside the railings. Above us, the balcony with the red painted rail-that's my flat. Now, it would be important, for the sake of this experiment, that she's feeling good. The last thing I ought to do is scare her. So I'd fit the scene up appropriately, say, give her the sense that my hand is round her shoulder, tell her an effective joke. I'd 78</page><page sequence="4">Sam North arrange things well: there'd be money in her pocket which she just got paid, it would have been a good week, whatever sort of week she likes best, she'd have had a laugh, or worked and pushed herself bloody hard, or perhaps good sex is at the party waiting for her. The lines in the pavement pass beneath our feet. 'What I love,' I'd say, 'is the way you can ride the bounce of a new pair of trainers.' The leather fashion boots are shining up at her. The Doc Marten's are just run in. Whatever. There's hours of new time ahead of her, for her own use. We turn the corner and head for the Alley. It's a useful short cut, a tunnel under the railway line that only a few of us know about. The train's thunder shakes the dampened, old and for gotten brickwork. We feel in the thick of it, nippy round the houses, saving ourselves some spare minutes with our knowl edge of the city. We feel clever, and fit and well, calm and peaceful, also, uncluttered with everyday worry, or adventur ous, or we're fizzing with energy. We feel brave as a matter of course. If there's anything we don't want, it doesn't matter. We can take our pick. We feel like the sort of people we ought to be. We go on through the Alley, calm, unknowing. At the party we have a reasonably good time. It was on the way home, retracing the same route, that's when it happened. The event is scalded on my memory, and not a day goes past when I don't pick over the details. What kind of ghoul am I not to be able to switch into forget-mode on this? Fragments of action within what must have been an entire sequence: I have the man, a black male, idle, standing in his camel-hair overcoat like he's waiting for a bus, with his hands loose in his coat pockets. I have him swaying into my path unexpectedly to ask a polite question about the time, please. I have my over-friendly answer, my last moment of dumb confi dence. I don't have his face, or his hands, although I must have seen them clearly when he held my wrist to see the watch for himself. I have his voice, his careless slouch, and the loud double click of the knife as it sprung open on its way from his pocket. I can see, in lurid detail, like I've tinted the memory for special 79</page><page sequence="5">Mississippi Review effect, the blade against the underside of my wrist. That is a shivered splinter of a memory that's gone in, something that I wanted so much not to have happened that I end up re-running it, making it happen over and over as a warning. When he got what he wanted (the watch and my wallet) he pushed me off, uttering an insult. I angrily strode about not knowing what to do; just as I was feeling glad that I'd escaped with my jewellery intact, got off quite lightly, maybe-except, that is, for what was then just a hint, a new something, knowl edge, the awful first settling of fear in the eaves-I noticed wetness and looked down to see that the push had been a deliberate wound, and then I saw the man running at me again, accompanied by others. That's when I turned to chase hard for that short-cut home, that gritty, cold-infested Alley. This is where I'll implant her with what happened, so she'll know me. I'd take her to the exact spot, over by the soaking wall, where the sediments have crept to make a thin bed of slime over the ruptured tarmac. Let the thunder from a train turn us forward a few minutes; suppose that time has flown, and brought us to a moment of crisis ... I speak slowly inside her head, 'It's dark, you're out of breath from running so hard, pounding the pavements, your arms carving the air, useless limbs! You're not bothering to check the roads for traffic, just running with instinct, the threat of them at the back of your neck, you're willing yourself to get home. Here in the alley they catch you and hold you. In this exact spot. All draw breath. One coughs on the outward gasps. Or is it a laugh? (Another arrives late and bends over his knees to pump air.) When they push you to the ground you feel the cool slip of the sediment on your cheek. Do you know the hand groping the back of your head? What's the connection? Why are they doing this to you? The hand presses your face into the slime, until the corner of your mouth hits the tarmac underneath. Your lip is pinched between your teeth and the ground. Now is the time to tell you, while you're struggling to pull your lip free and they're pressing harder and your bare tooth, you know, the sharp 80</page><page sequence="6">Sam North incisor at the corner, is being driven into the ground, now is the time for you to know that they are doing this for a fucking good reason, the best reason-because they want to.' (She's imagining it. If she's riding a bus she's beyond her stop. She's staring, wondering why she's seeing this.) 'You've been trying to take the strain onto your chin but the weight of the man, as he rocks back and forth with his hands on your head, overwhelms you, your tooth is the victim. I haven't got good teeth. That one was capped, so it was already vulner able. It snapped quite easily at the time, the one next to it went too. How long would it take before yours would break? Any way, now, for my sake, I want you to feel it levered against the gum and then snap. They already had your money, back at the Original Incident. They already had your blood. Not serious blood, but now they find it again, and kick it, where itbleeds into your shirt. They kick it again. It's fun. They kick and they kick their own wound until it's got too long since you passed a breath and you lose consciousness. So you find bliss, a release, folded round the force of the incoming trainers.' What shape does the inside of someone's character take? Will I recognise it from the outside? I should listen carefully, having finished, to see if there are any repercussions to my story. I can recall something, it was after I lost consciousness. There was no more breathing, no more noises in their throats, the sudden absence of hands-on violence, but I do remember these rootless, vague 'thuds' drifting into my stomach. I didn't feel them. It was like a spiritual thing. I heard them with my inner ear. There . . . that's where I'm really, fucking, inescapably bruised, where no blood gets to, where there's no immunity, where no polypeptide chains can be called up to carry away the infection.... I don't think that I'm cruel, myself. I have a motive: I want someone to be here with me in this hole that I've drilled myself into, to walk beside me, round and round in small circles in a bare flat in London. I'm desperate enough to force myself on her, I can't wait for us to intersect. 81</page><page sequence="7">Mississippi Review I'd pick her up and lift her arm round my shoulder. We hobble well together, like in a war movie if there was a bit of smoke. I'd take her home and wait to share an understanding. She could say that she'd seen much worse, suffered trauma more concentrated and poisonous than that which we've just gone through. I considered that before I started, decided it didn't matter. We're not trying to put a premium on a particular sort of violence here. Whatever it is that's blighted anyone's life in that way, it has an effect on me now. This is what happens: it makes me sour with grief. I'm with them, I'm on their side, and I'm so fucking angry. For instance when I watch TV footage of the Nazi holocaust I break into a shaking, blinding, automatic rage of sympathy. I feel dirty, and violent, and burnt up with a thousand detailed considerations of my revenge. Our revenge. I tell you it's not television any more. We've been forced to take it personally, she and I as we make our way back to the safety of the flat. You know what the difference is? It's something frightening that's left behind when the bewilderment, the an ger, the growling plans for revenge and the utterances on justice have all been worked out and cast aside, it's the answer, what it all boils down to. It'sfear that makes all the difference. We're passing by the railings now, struggling along under each other's arm. Not far to go. 'Your eyes are unwilling to look much around you but I promise they're working better than ever before, they only look glazed and shuttered because they are seeing too much of a bad thing. These railings? No, not simple railings put up to stop people getting in, not for you, it's no wonder your eyes are closing because the railings show themselves to you now as a row of rusty spears welded together and set in concrete, waiting for the next accident or suicide . . .' In the flats directly above, each inhabitant has a private door onto a small concrete balcony. Climbing the stairwell I'd have her look down at our feet, trying to control the difficult operation of getting hers moving one after the other up the steps, past the individual tragedies of the cigarette ends smeared flat into the concrete, the filters, each 82</page><page sequence="8">Sam North with a small circular stain printed on the end, levered up, in pain. The door is ours, the keys fit, the locks obey. It's a pleasure, how smoothly they move, slide behind us, sealing out danger. (Admit to the charade, to what we're talking about here, one isolated chef, bitten by fear and infected by it, inventing a friend like a school kid .. .) The flat not safe until 'she' arrives. Because this isn't good enough, how it is Inow, filling in time with an invention. It isn't possible, is it, for an invention to take me into the bedroom, lay me down, hold my head tightly in its hands, and press the surface of my brow with its thumbs? Move them in patterns. Repeat them over and over, until they're something, anything, that I can be 100%, top-to-toe sure of. Then I can sleep ... No, not allowed. Heart slowing. The blood's pulse, no longer banging in my ears, dropping back down to my chest. Repeat to myself a list of peaceful things ... I shall increase my searching in the streets for a face. How much longer am I going to have to wait? One more thing. Perhaps I'll visit again, when she sleeps. I'll whisper, 'Look through the spyhole again. Not the same, is it? You approach it now with a certain reverence. The distortion is alarming. And you see him now, the tall figure waiting, a cloak draped over his arm. D'you know who he is?' He is my Opponent. He isn't too much of an invention because, after all, my attacker had my name and address from my wallet and I was certain he'd turn up. The imagined figure was merely put there to prevent him-if you expect something to happen, it never does, so it was by way of a fervent expectation. In the beginning I imagined a black male wearing a camel hair overcoat and carrying the nasty sounding flick-knife in his pocket. I recreated the man's behaviour: he lounged outside the 83</page><page sequence="9">Mississippi Reviezw front door, often blocking the stairwell by leaning the length of one arm against the wall and staring down at his feet. He hardly looked at me at all. He didn't need to. It wasn't long before I deduced that it was he who was leaving all the cigarette butts in the stairwell and who put the lift out of action every day. Then he changed, became more than just a direct figuration of that man's impending arrival. This was due to a fright I had one night. I don't know why I woke up. I was looking out from mybed and what I saw made my eyes stir quickly into wakefulness. There was a hooded figure standing just beyond the bedroom door. As I stared harder to make it go away the figure resolved into a clearer shape: tall, black like a shadow, with a hood sloping onto his shoulders and a cloak that fell to his feet. He stood perfectly still. I couldn't see a single contour of his face. After a while I realised he couldn't be human, no-one could remain motionless for that long. I can't imagine being more awake than I was then, my elbow so nerved up I could hardly lean on it. I stared. My first ghost? That's when I thought: 'This is my Opponent.' I looked hard; the shape swam from the force of my concentration. Exciting, because still it stayed there. I tried to communicate-'Who are you?' I expected a hollow voice to reply in my head, but the figure remained impassive. The night gained status. To think that I'd conjured this figure. It wasn't the end of it when I realised that the bedroom door was shut and the hooded figure 'in the hallway' was made up of the dressing gown and towel hanging on the back of the door. Because the figure made his mark. He's a more suitable Opponent. He encompasses more than the simple imagining of a violent man who once turned you over and still has your name and address. More symbolic. He's acquired melodra matic stature. 84</page><page sequence="10">Sam North November 3 Leave the bathroom, step into the corridor, (wide enough for two people to pass except where the fuse box and gas meter are fixed into a white cupboard) and the front door is on your left. It has a frosted glass panel in the middle of it with the spy hole on top. Turn right, walk two paces, and the kitchen is on the right, a well organised set-up with stainless steel surfaces made to my own specification (my job makes me fussy). Beyond the kitchen, a spare bedroom. Beyond that, my bedroom. Opposite, on the other side of the corridor, is the lounge, which has a condensation problem; pools of water leave tide marks on the painted window-sill in winter. From here there's a wide view over London as the window takes up most of one wall, spread ing the city like a living map in the mind of someone who spends too long in this room. The square mile of stomping-ground beneath the window is well pegged out in my mind with place names: the Alley, the place of the Original Incident; the Tube. At night the window turns into a flat display of lights shining through your own reflection in the glass. Behind the wall is somebody else's lounge exactly the same but back to back. There live the people who have the fights in a foreign language which I hear either when I'm lying in bed or in here looking out of the window. Terrible long sentences of gibberish in a deep voice (from him) are cut into by her sharp commands and her screams that aren't fearful screams, more like things designed to stop him. The pattern of the flat is repeated six hundred and twenty times in blocks on three sides. I bothered to count. I'm on the fifth floor, with the standard broken steel box that used to be a lift. I've travelled hours of time in front of the big window in the lounge, either standing with my elbows on the sill or sitting in the fat chair, focusing alternately on the outside world and then on my reflection; a fly on the wall crawling along on the fifth floor would see me standing, sitting, facing up to something that you can't organise out of your life, thinking, thinking round 85</page><page sequence="11">Alississippi Review and round the bloody little serpent, banging my head against nothing (and it still hurts): I could open the door onto the little balcony and scramble over the rail untidily, it would be exciting to begin with and I'd be curious about the end, I could do it out of sheer curiosity, and to escape the misery of being this side of the fence. So there's a carrot dangling in front of me and I'm being thrashed from behind, but I don't want to lose, I want to turn round and snap the bloody stick into pieces. I refuse. I'll drag something out of the muddle and it'll be the answer. November 5 Walking towards the Alley (the usual order to myself: cross the road, walk past on the other side), my sight fidgets on the rubbish at the entrance, looking for dead bodies and discarded babies, I probe deep in the perspective of it, planning revenges, it's like how my fingers work on a spot on my back, you wish the thing would disappear, but you can't help touching it, making it worse. In my hand, as I walk, I carry twelve postcards written out in a plain style, to be seeded around my area. I will deliver them, paying a small sum so they'll be shown in newsagents' win dows. I imagine I will stop and read them, wherever they are, over the coming weeks, as though they might tell me something about myself. 'Room to rent. Easy-going. A quiet place. Cheap.' I think, Like a hand of cards, a gamble to win her. This fear. See how it colours everything differently: as I round the shoulder of pavement I hear, from the building on my right, a scream. I stop and look up. Evidence of an old sign nailed to the wall: 'Council . . . development of 64 Maisonettes . . .' From behind the sign comes the girl's cry again, breathless, clumsy. It's a terrified noise coming from a female's throat as I stand, 86</page><page sequence="12">Sam North powerless. There are other sounds, like she's being assaulted. Every few seconds I hear more shouts and screams coming from the maisonette. But I know I'm going to turn on my heel and walk down the road. Mental paralysis. As I walk away I feel that each step is responsible for another injury to her. Disgusted at the sickness that's infected me so thoroughly. I'll remember those energetically recoiling steps each time I mark them again, I'll always look up to the silent row of windows, waiting for a sign, or evidence, or some form of relief, forgiveness. November 6 My pictures, hung in the lounge: the one near the door is by Salvador Dali entitled 'The Anthropomorphic Cabinet.' It shows a figure reclining on the floor, propped on its arm, a series of drawers coming out of its stomach and chest. A piece of cloth is hanging from the third drawer. Hair sprouts from his chin. It's painted with an intense lucidity, so weird in detail that you can't believe that you recognise it. It has one arm outstretched to wards a distant doorway that lets onto a street scene where ordinary people are walking. I'm uncertain as to whether it's reaching out for help, or inviting people into the empty brown space, but whichever, it makes the figure look lonely. At the other end of the room facing the Dali is a picture by a man called Chaissac, of a face, painted in a naive style, mostly green. The eyes are large and distinctly coloured. One is soft and kind to you when you look at it; the other, yellow, looks angry enough to kill, and it would be for a good reason; the rage comes at you with tenacity. Growing from the top of the head is a thick stem on top of which is set a curved growth. This growth is the answer to everything. If you were to look into the kind eye that responds to pity and ask the face, 'Why?', it would with a gentle 87</page><page sequence="13">Alfississippi Reviezv lift of the eye indicate the growth as the reason. If you look into the angry eye, and ask, 'Why?', it would lift a finger and point at you-you'd find you had a growth of your own. The picture has a depth to it, obscured by the cloudy mauve, the depth is behind the picture. This copy of the Chaissac is hanging in the perfect place because behind the wall is next door's lounge and when I hear the rows coming through as a fast succession of his angry, unintelligible sounds, intersected by her commanding screams, I look at the Chaissac, see the weight of the growth on the stem, the anger, sadness-then it makes perfect sense. November 7 I pray fervently every time an ambulance goes past, sometimes you see shady figures through the darkened windows and I address themdirectlyand extravagantly, {Whateverhappened,alltheluckIcan drag out of this fucking city, have it!' Even if the most heinous ciminal has been scraped off the tarmac and put in the back there, I think it's a place which could change him, because he would be suffering. I could watch him suffering. The ambulance set me thinking of the war and the past generation of people who signed on the dotted line and found themselves living with daily horrors for years. Some people, I'd heard, who had no physical courage, could find it in them if they became ambulance drivers because they were free from the aggression of it all, they were released from the posturing. They enjoyed a different sort of courage. So I did it because, could I find something for myself in their mould? Managed to get out of the door past the Opponent. Fuck him and the evil smelling blanket he holds out for me. I can still hold myself up. The feeling when I was on my way to the ambulance station? That I'm getting a new chance. 88</page><page sequence="14">Sam North If I'd been an ambulance driver, would I have gone into the Screaming Maisonette? Would a polyester uniform and a funny hat have made any difference? It may have helped me deal with my fear, I would have had a role to hold onto, something to do with the vehicle, the uniform and the other people with me, all in the same uniform, expecting each other to go in. I would have been carried by the momentum. My job, my paid work to go in. Always the girl's screams will run ... At the ambulance station a man treated my enquiry with quiet humour. 'Don't want to work here, surely not?' He took me over to another man in an office, who was wearing a different uniform. I repeated my question to him. Application form. Remember. The men and women that I saw in the office and around the vehicles had something going. They made an atmosphere, which I briefly stepped into. I wanted to stay, share a quiet joke with the first man, and follow an order, simply and correctly, from the second man, be part of things. November 9 Turned up late for work several times this week. The manager has a measure of curiosity, he wants me to explain, tell him it's all a mistake, he's not going to lose his chef. He's worried because I have a speciality which brings him folding cash: black currant steak ... It's ridiculous to cry over such an absurd thing. The waitress Sally heard me in the staff bog and came in. I'd been waiting for somebody, anybody, so I'd left the door unlocked. She asks the question in a voice for babies, dropping on one knee in front of my throne of unhappiness, 'What is it?' '. . . the black currant steak! Bloody thing!' 'What about it?' 'I can't do it any more. Can't. I'm sorry ... 'You do it fine . . . you're the only one who can.' 89</page><page sequence="15">Mississippi Reviezv 'That's ... that's the bloody trouble. Why can't someone else do it for once?' 'I know, I know. I'm fed up with this place too.' She speaks kindly, putting some real effort into me. There's a genuine search of my face going on. So why can't I use her? Because she hasn't got what I want. She's like a professional, yes, but I couldn't take someone who so obviously looks like they want to help me, that would be humiliating. I take the knife from where I'd stuck it into the wall and hold it down the length of my knee. 'Look at this thing,' I say. 'I think we ought to get back to work now.' She's put on a firm voice. She wants to control the knife, it's frightening her. 'It's a ... it's a knife.' I gasp over the last word. My tears are dried up. It feels like my eyes are smoking. 'Have you any idea,' I continue, 'how difficult it is to say that word?' 'What's the matter? What are you crying about? I can't help until I know.' 'That's the worst . .. that's what's so fucking stupid . . . it's nothing. There's no reason!' I start to laugh. The laughter dissolves our worry like magic, and she joins in happily. The trouble in the bog with the chef is all part and parcel of the soap opera of the restaurant. It's all television. Sally leaves, still laughing. I dangle the.. . thing, the thing with the blade and the handle ... I put the tip of the blade to my scar (note thrill of horror) and I imagine myself gutless. My search for the face ... The restaurant is good for that. I have a licence to observe. Make special Chef's trips out among the tables to enquire whether the food is satisfactory. Solici tous questions. She won't be eating the black currant steak, when I ask her why not she'll say it's because she's vegetarian. I'll then describe how the quarter-carcasses arrive in a recognisable shape, how I have to take my own set of . . . my half dozen-they could be 90</page><page sequence="16">Sam North described as my personal set of weapons-to deal with the animal, and in the middle of my blood-thirsty description ... she'll unstring my fear? November 11 Yesterday: the little girl in the park came up to me because I was talking to her dog. She was friendly and confident and we sat down eventually because we were talking for such a long time. I became interested when she said she didn't like boys. 'Why, what is it about boys?' 'Something.' 'There's something about boys?' 'Yes. Something that puts you off.' 'Is it something cruel?' 'Yes.' 'Are you afraid of boys?' 'Yes.' I felt moved with pity and friendship. Here, in this miniature person, was a smaller version, an understanding (but with lower horizons) of everything that is threatening to drown me out of my own life. It was when I looked at her and saw how her fine hair blew across her face, how her clumsy half-made hand drew it back, how her eyes glistened like newly-made and her smile held steadily and eagerly in spite of her fear of boys, that's when I nearly made a fool of myself. I considered telling her the details of my own fear, how I was not 'afraid of boys' but afraid of one particular sort of boy-but that yes, she was right, every boy had that mean streak in the colour of his eye that could turn him into a mad dog. What stopped me from saying all this was that I remembered: I am a boy. 91</page><page sequence="17">Mississippi Review November 12 What's up in my head? What's going on that I'm not allowed back in to control it? I remember when I thought the whole thing would disappear after a few aspirins and a talk with some policemen. Note-slight discomfort, turning so urgently to the 'per sonal' section of the local paper. There it is, in a line with the others, my ad: 'Isolated,fearful, hang-dog chef, lost in maze ofconcrete, seeks afemaleface with a light like Florence Nightingale's. I'll lick your wound if you'll lick mine. Box 3072' People all over the city will sneer. They'll read through them, as I do, scanning quickly to find sex and distress. This week's list. But somewhere, my face, the one whose help I'm waiting for, will read and feel her interest quicken. Of course, turn then to reading more of those little violent paragraphs: 'An eighty-seven year old crippled widow is recov ering in hospital after three masked men...' Frustrated, full of energy that's powerless, that has no root. November 18 In the dark I listen to the noises within this giant, broken, everything-square block of patterned and obstinate concrete. Some noises are familiar: an inexplicable rattle from upstairs, the sporadic row in a foreign language barely muffled by my bedroom wall. I need to hang onto something, a peg, set somewhere in the future, to reach out for, to stop all this darkness from crowding me. The face I'm looking for has been born, has grown up, is walking around somewhere, perhaps not far away. She just needs to come close enough. Can you turn fate? Can you hustle a chance along faster? 92</page><page sequence="18">Sam North I'm not looking for sex, or prettiness. I like the way a woman's body works, the practice of getting a good fit be tween the male and female skin, the progress of a smile, a sexual stance to the eye, but I've seen all this, it's not what I want. The face, when I find it, will speak to me. It will be something to do with kindness. November 22 Just seen a film, a documentary about Tibet. It followed a certain ritual that takes place as part of the religious scene up in the mountains. The men prepare themselves for this one day which is spent in the temple on the mountainside. Some rock back and forth and knock out single beats from the skin drums with a curved stick. Some chant. There's incense, sent out in great quaffs of smoke by the man swinging the container. It all amounts to a tiny collection of devout people, descended from a consistent history, gathered on the side of a mountain so vast it could make one of the haunches of this planet; and the pinpoint, the focus of the whole ceremony, is the tip of a dagger. A man dances with this weapon. His pace is slow, one step takes minutes to move to its conclusion. The dagger leads the dance, the man, its partner, follows in a tortuous pattern. The idea is that the man should engage with the dagger and it will enter him and cut out all the bad feeling that's built in him throughout the year. He will be exorcised. There are lots of reasons why it doesn't work with me. When I bring the knife towards me in an imitation of one of his moves, I feel an increase in the volume of my bad feeling. I have a bad feeling about the knife itself. I haven't got the ability to impart any symbolic power to this kitchen implement, its brutal facticity holds me bewitched. It has the cold dullness of a shark's eye. It has literally got under my skin.

I can never have another history, I'm landed here dealing with this. November 30 Second-hand bed, dressing table, chair, (?98 from the Oxfam furniture store). Tomorrow, put up hanging rail. Rent agreed at ?20, OK, minimal for a small room in a flat virtually bereft of homely comforts. Not sure about her face. She is older than me, but even taking that into account it's harsh. Looks like you could split logs with it. (She's not trying to be quiet in there, I can hear her cough, and the drawers tunnelling in the dresser.) I feel servile when I talk to her, maybe because she looks clever? Or because I'm taking money from her. Don't think she'll be tolerant of anything I might give away about myself; she has a prickly, unsympathetic heat in her eye. She's called Chrissy. She works in quality-control for a food manufacturer. That makes her a technician, or a scientist? Didn't ask for details. She thought I'd want a reference from her employer, the last thing I'm worried about, I have an immediate reward more important than regular payment of rent: whether she's 'the one' or not, I have this great wash of confidence, a new weapon for my personal security. Feel as safe as a new lock. There's another person. Her with me. Excerptedfromi The Automatic Man. Reprititd by permissiotn of the auiithor. 94</page></plain_text>
