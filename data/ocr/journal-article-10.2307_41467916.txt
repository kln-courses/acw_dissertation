<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Eighteenth Century, volM no. 1 "Go, Get Your Husband Put into Commission": Fielding's Tom Thumb Plays and the Labor of Little Men Deborah Needleman Armintor University of North Texas "In Tasks so bold, can Little Men engage" - Pope, "The Rape of the Lock"1 "my Grand-mamma hath often said, / Tom Thumb , beware of Marriage" - Fielding, Tom Thumb2 In 1730, Henry Fielding wrote a series of love poems addressed to "Celia," otherwise known as Charlotte Cradock, whom he eventually married in 1734.3 In one of these poems, entitled "To the Same. On Her Wishing to Have a Lil- liputian to Play With," the author muses: "May I, to please my lovely dame, / Be five foot shorter than I am; / And, to be greater in her eyes, / Be sunk to Lil- liputian size."4 Reduced to Lilliputian size - just under six inches, according to Swift's Gulliver's Travels - Fielding imagines himself dancing on his beloved's hand and carted along in her gown, hat, and pocket, in order to "be, / My Celia, what is prized by thee."5 The poem's conclusion finds the miniature Fielding positioned on the sleeping Celia's pillow "[w]hile I survey her bosom rise," a voyeuristic scenario permissible only because, as he admits in a paren- thetical phrase, "afraid she could not be / Of such a little thing as me" - his body and genitals, and their proximity to Celia's body and genitals, no longer posing a sexual threat to her, even in bed.6 And yet therein lies the "catch" of Fielding's Lilliputian fantasy: the extraordinary circumstances that grant him unprecedented access to Celia's body and bed leave him physically unable to do anything about it. Becoming what Celia desires, "a Lilliputian to Play with," reduces his entire body to penis-size and thereby makes his own geni- talia both physically and symbolically irrelevant. Hence, Fielding states, "Here would begin my former pain / And wish to be myself again."7 Read alongside Fielding's better-known works of "little man" literature - the popular two-act comedy, Tom Thumb (1730), and the three-act Tragedy of Tragedies (1731) - the author's 1730 Lilliputian love poem to his future wife underscores a prominent comical theme in the plays that has yet to be critical- ly explored: the question of how the thumb-sized protagonist and his beloved fianc√©e, the statuesque Princess Huncamunca, will consummate their 69</page><page sequence="2">70 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY impending marriage.8 Whereas in the poem Fielding precludes sexual inter- course between a Lilliputian man and the woman he desires, in the Tom Thumb plays he goes so far as to suggest that Tom Thumb's size actually makes him a superlative sexual partner for the "real-life" modern English woman. Tom Thumb makes the argument himself when, in the last lines of the epilogue to Tom Thumb , he propositions the women in the audience who might regard him as sexually incompatible because of his "inferior Size." If they put him to the test, he proposes, they might find him to be a superior lover: But, for the Ladies, they, I know despise The little Things of my inferior Size Their mighty Souls are all of them too large To take so small a Heroe to their Charge. Take Pity, Ladies, on a young Beginner; Faith! I may prove, in time, a thumping Sinner.9 The double meaning of the word "thumping" in "thumping Sinner" under- scores the sexual joke by linking Tom Thumb's "thumping" stature - "thump- ing" meaning "of striking size" - with his ability to "thump," meaning to pound as does a "fist, a club, or any blunt instrument" (OED). "Thumb," like "thump," has a double meaning of its own, being a symbol of female masturbation, and also, like the word "Thomas," a common early- modern colloquialism for the penis. Through these and other double enten- dres, the plays reiterate in act after act the joke that marital consummation is only possible for Tom Thumb and his normal-sized bride-to-be if she uses his entire body as a phallic sexual prop - that is to say, a human dildo. This method of conjugal intercourse, Fielding makes clear, would provide great pleasure for Huncamunca but great danger for Tom Thumb, who risks not only physical discomfort but also the possibility of being literally swallowed up in the act. This brings us to the most surreal and satirical dimension of this comical pornographic scenario: its appearance throughout the plays in the economic and gastronomic terms of male labor and female appetite, with Huncamunca as hungry consumer and Tom Thumb as both devoured object and abused worker. When we consider that Fielding's fantastical presentation of spousal inti- macy was conceived at a time marked by a dramatic rise in female consump- tion of the economic variety, the plays' central dirty joke reveals itself to be as socioeconomically relevant as it is bawdy.10 Starting in the 1720s, as recent crit- ics of eighteenth-century culture have noted, the quantity and quality of "goods" in England were greater and more available to a wider range of con- sumers than ever before.11 The consumption of goods came to play an increas- ingly prominent role in social life, establishing the origins of the consumer- based society in which we now live. In the early 1700s, it was not uncommon</page><page sequence="3">ARMINTOR- FIELDING'S TOM THUMB PLAYS 71 for those skeptical about the new consumerism to project their anxieties over this socioeconomic development onto the bodies of English women, portray- ing them as all-consuming, ravenous devourers of goods. "Although women's voracity has long been asserted," writes Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wal- lace, "history awaited the proliferation of consumer commodities to make the specific connection between female appetite and the world of goods. With the birth of a consumer culture, women were assumed to be hungry for things - for dresses and furniture, for tea cups and carriages, for all commodities that indulged the body and enhanced physical life."12 By portraying one such woman-consumed thing as a pocket-sized man, Fielding's Tom Thumb plays combine these anxieties over female consump- tion with anxieties over contemporaneous changes in the cultural arenas of heterosexual courtship and marriage. When women become insatiable con- sumers of goods, the plays suggest, what is to stop those women from extend- ing their behavior in the marketplace into the realms of courtship and mar- riage, and becoming insatiable consumers of men? Or, to put it another way: what is to stop men from becoming the consumed objects of this new breed of woman? This paranoiac reasoning behind the sexual humor of Fielding's Tom Thumb plays, though of course comical, is not entirely isolated from the cul- tural reality of Fielding's time. By the 1730s, gender roles and marital roles were shifting to conform to the new rules of the new middle-class cult of com- panionate marriage, in which women were thought of no longer as merely exchanged goods in marriage but also as discerning buyers in the marriage market. It is in the context of this cultural climate that Fielding portrays Hun- camunca as an insatiable female consumer who might literally devour her husband-to-be on or before their wedding night. By depicting the little man not only as the object of the female consumer (as both her commodity fetish and sexual fetish), but also as her menial laborer (referring to Tom Thumb as Huncamunca's "Chimney-Sweeper," 1.3.55, and her "commissioner to dis- charge," 2.10.44), Fielding suggests that in a culture in which women are the consumers and men the consumed, women relinquish their roles as producers (of children and of breast milk) in marriage and as consumed objects (as wives and prostitutes) in the marital and sexual marketplace, and men become soci- ety's new sexual labors and the objects of the new female consumption. Extending "To the Same. On Her Wishing to Have a Lilliputian to Play With" into a full-fledged narrative, Fielding's Tom Thumb plays transform the per- sonal poem's subtle sexual humor into a bawdy social satire on modern courtship in the age of the new consumerism. I. Such a reading of Fielding's Tom Thumb plays requires an investigation into two other little men of the period: "Monsieur Thing" and "Signior Dildo," the</page><page sequence="4">72 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY protagonists of an underanalyzed late-seventeenth- and eighteenth-century comical pornographic genre best described as anthropomorphic dildo poetry. Representing sexual props as miniature menial laborers, these poems not only illuminate the sexual and socioeconomic satire behind Fielding's Tom Thumb plays, but also qualify as the plays' unacknowledged forebears. Based on actu- al single-legged anthropomorphic phallic sexual props sold in English "toy shops" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, these poems depict their dildo protagonists as French or Italian male workers in the hands of enormous English women who subject them to a form of sexual intercourse character- ized in both the poems and in Fielding's plays as an oppressive and emascu- lating form of abuse.13 In each of these poems, the foreignness of the anthropo- morphic male dildo only highlights the Englishness of the women who abuse him.14 In contrast to non-anthropomorphic early-modern dildo literature, a genre which typically portrays the sexual prop as a symbol of female autoerotic or homoerotic sexual pleasure independent of men, anthropomorphic dildo lit- erature provides heterosexual scenarios in which the key players are women (the users) and men (the anthropomorphic sexual props themselves).15 In these texts, heterosexual relations appear as exploitive arrangements between worker/commodity (men) and consumer (women), a characterization that sexualizes the economic exploitation of the menial laborer in the new capital- ist economy, and targets the new consuming English woman. One such poem, "Dildoides" (1722), commonly attributed to Samuel But- ler, opens by characterizing the titular props as both inanimate commodities and oppressed foreign workers.16 Based on a real-life event in which a London mob burned a shipment of imported French dildos, the poem begins with one objecting member of the crowd defending the dildos by appealing to the self- interested capitalist instincts of the other men in the group. Characterizing the dildo as an asset to female consumers, but above all to the male capitalists in the audience, he claims: If Ladyes rather choose to handle Our Wax in Dildo, than in Candle, Much good may't do 'em, so they Pay for't And that the merchant never stay for't. For neighbours is't not all one whether They wear in Shoes, or P - cks our Leather?"17 This mercantile speaker goes on to claim that although he shares his compatri- ots' hatred of foreigners, he intends to put his self-interest before his xenopho- bia (or rather, to combine the two) by putting "Monsieur Dildo" to work for his own benefit:</page><page sequence="5">ARMINTOR- FIELDING'S TOM THUMB PLAYS 73 Like you, I Monsieur Dildo hate, But your intentions let's Translate; You treat 'em may like Turks, or Jews, But I'le have two for my own use.18 The social and economic hierarchy in these passages is clear: at the bottom of the ladder is the exploited foreign worker, Monsieur Dildo; in the middle is the female consumer who consumes him; and at the top is the male capitalist who profits from both the labor of Monsieur Dildo and the buying habits of the female consumer. Predating Marx's description of the "mystical" quality of the commodity fetish in capitalist culture, "Dildoides" characterizes the props as priapic gods worshipped by the female consumer: commenting upon the actions of the members of the all-male mob who, "[f]orgetting each his Wife and Daughter, / Condemn'd these Dildoes to the Slaughter," the narrator sarcastically exclaims, "Oh! Barbarous Tymes, when Deitys / Become themselves a Sacri- fice!" 19 However, rather than confirming their wives' and daughters' idolatry by turning these little men into martyrs, the pyromaniacal mob ultimately defeats the seeming immortality of the dildos' always-erect condition, negat- ing the mystical status of these props once and for all: "Priapus thus in Box opprest, / Burnt like a Phoenix in his Nest, / But with this fatali difference dyes, / We find no Dildoes from his Ashes Rise/'20 Leaving the dildo-burners victorious over the female commodities that challenge their own authority as husbands and fathers, the poem uses the figure of the little man to satirize the misogynistic emasculation anxieties behind condemnation of female consumerism, while at the same time casting doubt on the dildo-defender's belief that men are the beneficiaries, rather than the victims, of female consumption. In contrast to "Dildoides," the poem "Signior Dildo" (1673, first printed in 1703), commonly attributed to John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, introduces its protagonist not as a foreign worker, but as a foreign gentleman, a "Noble Ital- ian call'd Signior Dildo."21 And yet, "Signior Dildo" asserts its protagonist's alleged gentleman status only in order to expose it as a false pretense: "Were this signior but known to the citizen fops, / He'd keep their fine wives from the foremen of shops," the narrator remarks, suggesting that in spite of his pretensions to class privilege, Signior Dildo is in fact a mere consumer com- modity 22 Although Signior Dildo enjoys the access to high society that his gen- tlemanly status provides him, that status and access only serve to make him the abused commodity of female consumers of the English aristocracy who "stifled him almost beneath her pillow, / So closely sh'embraced Signior Dildo," rather than the abused commodity of female consumers of the bour- geoisie.23 The titular little man's 'tragic flaw,' the poem reveals, is his false con- sciousness regarding his own commercial status. Like the procapitalist dildo-</page><page sequence="6">74 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY defenders of "Dildoides," the "little man" protagonist of "Signior Dildo" dis- avows female consumerism's emasculating effects upon the male body. The anonymous "Monsieur Thing's Origin: Or Seignior D 's Adventures in Britain" (1722), the most narratively complex of these poems, introduces its protagonist as a multinational anthropomorphic dildo of French birth and Italian citizenship (interchangeably referred to as "Monsieur" and "Seignor") who emigrates to England and finds work performing grueling sexual labor for English women. Although the majority of the poem characterizes Mon- sieur Thing as an oppressed foreign menial laborer made to "slave and toil" for insatiable English female consumers and supervisors, the poem begins by suggesting that upon moving to England and making his unique talents into a profitable career, Monsieur Thing has successfully ascended the socioeconom- ic ladder and become a mercantile capitalist and bourgeois English husband. In the beginning of the poem, Monsieur Thing arrives in England with his family, in search of work and lodging: When SEIGNIOR first at London did arrive, Was put to shifts to know how to contrive, Or find a Place where's Family shou'd live. At length all day after they had been trudging, Tire'd with Fatigue, in seeking of Lodging, Were shew'd a TOY-SHOP, nigh to Covent- Garden.2* In the lines that immediately follow, Monsieur Thing seems to have become a social-climbing mercantile capitalist whose "Qualities" and "Capacity" seem to have earned him success, renown, and, above all, the status of Englishman:25 Where for some time they liv'd in private Room, But soon became unto the Publick known, Because his Qualities were really such, Cou'd with small Help do Little or do Much : For his Capacity, made Denizen, 'Twas thus Monsieur became an Englishman.26 As evidence of Monsieur's ostensible climb up the social ladder, the pro- ceeding lines characterize an increase in the shop's dildo inventory as a testa- ment to Monsieur's success as a potent paterfamilias who, having added to his family (of dildos), and having acquired the bourgeois pretensions befitting a successful "Englishman," moves his growing family from the toy shop in Covent Garden to a larger and better one in the Fleet: Before 'twas long, the Number did increase, So the last Brood were to chuse a new Place, That he should not be taken for a Clown,</page><page sequence="7">ARMINTOR- FIELDING'S TOM THUMB PLAYS 75 A Station chose, in Middle of the Town, In TOY-SHOP Large, and nigh unto a Church, In Fleetstreet did this Lovely Creature perch.27 However, Monsieur Thing soon discovers that he is not a socially mobile English capitalist after all but is instead an abused immigrant slave laborer whose "Drudge" is to "slave and toil" for the benefit of English women. What the beginning of the poem praises as his "Qualities" and "Capacity" turn out to refer not to any special talents but instead to his objectified body's utility to female consumers as an inexhaustible working machine that produces female sexual pleasure. The women forc'd him in the Summit of their Bliss ; And after they had tasted, made a Drudge Worse than a Waterman, who wears a Badge, Or Ticket-Porter in the Street that plies, Burthen'd with Loads, is in no worse Disguise, Than to their Lust he is a Sacrifice.28 Capable of infinitely producing female sexual pleasure because of his eternal- ly erect state, able to withstand incredible abuse, and, like the Marxian worker in a capitalist economy, unable to stake any claim to the product he makes (female sexual pleasure), this self-made "Englishman" turns out to be the par- adigmatic objectified, inexhaustible, slave laborer.29 In being even "[w]orse than a Waterman" or "Ticket-Porter" (my italics) - and other free wage laborers in that Marxian category of "individuals" who sell "the particular expenditure of force to a particular capitalist, whom he confronts as an independent individual" - Monsieur falls under the Marxian category of the slave laborer who "belongs to the individual, particular owner, and functions as his laboring machine."30 The unfortunate reality of this little man's status as a laboring machine becomes painfully apparent to him when - after posturing as an upwardly mobile bourgeois Englishman - he finds himself snatched up by a merchant's wife who boldly work'd him up unto an Oil, So did she make the Creature slave and toil; She wrought him till he was just out of breath, And harrast SEIGNOR almost unto Death; Until he was forc'd to chuse a new Place, To alter somewhat of his Slavish Case.31 Prior to this pivotal moment in which Monsieur Thing is "slavishly" abused by the merchant's wife, he has been comically oblivious to the fact that whatever the illusory distinctions might be between the slave laborer and the</page><page sequence="8">76 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY mercantile individual who is supposedly "free" as a real or honorary "Eng- lishman" to ascend the social ladder, all working people are mere instruments of production in the eyes of the consumers who benefit from their labor. Fan- cying himself a bourgeois Englishman, Monsieur Thing has mistaken what he sees as his success as an upwardly mobile mercantile capitalist for what are really the signs of his own commodification (being sold in various stores alongside other identical commodities). It is no coincidence that the abuser who brings Monsieur Thing to this tragicomic realization is the wife of a mer- chant: in the poem's reality, men only imagine themselves to be at the helm of the capitalist system. English female consumers, the poem suggests, are the ones who truly reap the rewards of capitalism, at the expense of little men. II. Invoking these poems' sex-as-menial-labor discourse, Fielding's Tom Thumb plays depict the modern Englishman, specifically the husband or husband-to- be, as an abused, menial-laboring phallic toy in the hands of the new consum- ing woman. These poems' likely influence on Fielding's Tom Thumb plays is apparent in an early conversation between Huncamunca and her attendant, Mustacha, in which the latter criticizes her mistress's desire for a man of Tom Thumb's size. Proclaims Mustacha: "I am surprised that your Highness can give your / self a Moments Uneasiness about that little insignificant Fellow, / Tom Thumb. One properer for a Play-thing than a Husband - / Were he my Husband, his Horns should be as long as his Body" (2.3.15-18). To any mem- bers of an eighteenth-century audience aware that the term "plaything" could refer not only to a child's toy but also to a sexual prop, the joke that the thumb- sized protagonist is better suited for a dildo than a husband would have been hard to miss.32 Huncamunca's rejoinder - " Tom Thumb's a Creature of that charming Form, / That no one can abuse, unless they love him" (2.3.32-33) - not only accuses Mustacha of desiring him, but also hints at the physical dis- comfort for Tom Thumb of being used in a sexual scenario in which Tom Thumb's "charming Form" makes physically loving him the same as physical- ly abusing him (as we have seen in the "slavish case" "Monsieur Thing"). In The Tragedy of Tragedies , Grizzle similarly characterizes Huncamunca's diminutive fianc√© as "properer for a Play-thing than a Husband": And can my Princess such a Durgen wed, One fitter for your Pocket than your Bed! Advis'd by me, the worthless Baby shun, Or you will ne'er be brought to bed of one. Oh take me to thy Arms and never flinch, Who am a Man by Jupiter ev'ry Inch. (2.4.19-24)</page><page sequence="9">ARMINTOR - FIELDING'S TOM THUMB PLAYS 77 And yet, as the play continually reminds us, while Tom Thumb's pocket size might indeed make him unable to cause his wife go into labor, it makes him perfectly fit for another sexual labor of his own. Tom Thumb's status as the laboring sexual prop of his wife-to-be is brought to the fore by the ludicrous metaphors and analogies that Tom Thumb and Huncamunca use in anticipation of their marriage and its consummation.33 In the following early speech, for instance, Tom Thumb expresses his delight that he is now able to throw aside his bloody war garments (from the war he suc- cessfully waged upon the giants that had been threatening the kingdom) and enter the bed of his beloved. Now that "[t]he dreadful Bus'ness of the War is over," he proclaims (1.3.50): I've thrown the bloody Garment now aside, And Hymeneal Sweets invite my Bride. So when some Chimney-Sweeper, all the Day, Has through dark Paths pursu'd the Sooty Way, At Night, to wash his Face and Hands he flies, And in his t'other Shirt with his Brickdusta lies. (1.3.53-58) In the first two lines of the passage, Tom Thumb's clumsy effort to contrast his bloody garment of war with the promise of "Hymeneal Sweets" actually ends out making an inadvertent and rather gory comparison between the blood of war and the hymeneal blood of conjugal sex. And yet the truly "perverse" sub- text of those lines does not fully reveal itself until the remaining lines, in which Tom Thumb goes on to compare himself to a chimneysweep who washes him- self of the soot he has acquired having "through dark Paths pursu'd the Sooty Way" and then lies in bed with his " Brickdusta " (a term affectionately describ- ing the hypothetical chimney sweep's wife as the rosy color of "brickdust" [OED]). Although Tom Thumb obviously intends to contrast the dirty work of the chimneysweep with the clean and pure love between a spousal couple, his continued imagery of dirtiness (from the blood of war to the soot of a chim- neysweep) indirectly compares the soot that covers a chimney sweep to the mess that will cover Tom Thumb's body on his wedding night, thereby linking the chimney sweep's labor in a chimney to the work of Tom Thumb's body in coitus, while comparing Huncamunca's vagina to a chimney's "dark Paths," and equating Tom Thumb - as his fianc√©e's miniature menial laborer - to the chimneysweep who laboriously pursues them. III. Significantly, Fielding's emphasis upon marriage is the narrative feature that most distinguishes these plays from the anthropomorphic dildo poems and the plays' other literary precursors, the seventeenth-century ballads "The His-</page><page sequence="10">78 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY tory of Tom Thumb" (n.d.) and "Tom Thumbe His Life and Death" (1630). The narrative of the plays begins in medias res , with Tom Thumb's return to King Arthur's kingdom after having heroically slain the giant that had been threat- ening the kingdom. When King Arthur asks the little hero to name his reward, Tom Thumb asks to marry the King's daughter, the Princess Huncamunca, who is fortunately already in love with him. The King grants Tom Thumb's wish, but the Queen Dollallolla, who secretly desires Tom Thumb, is outraged. Meanwhile, Lord Grizzle, Tom Thumb's romantic rival, conspires to do away with his little enemy.34 All this sets the stage for the outrageous final scene, in which the much-anticipated wedding between Tom Thumb and his physically mismatched fianc√©e is prevented by an enormous cow who swallows Tom Thumb offstage. Not to be outstaged by this bovine intruder, Tom Thumb returns from the cow in the form of the ghost, only to have his ghost "mur- dered" by Grizzle. The absurd murder of Tom Thumb's ghost prompts a paro- dically Hamletesque finale in which the entire cast kills each other off one by one until the only one left standing, the King, takes his own life so as not to be the odd one out.35 Whereas the early ballads narrate the death-defying adven- tures and mishaps on the part of the miniature hero while testifying ironically to his virile masculinity, the plays shift the focus of the Tom Thumb narrative from a series of life-threatening adventures to a single danger that hovers over Tom Thumb throughout the plays: his impending marriage and its consum- mation.36 While the ballads lack any marriage plot whatsoever, in Fielding's plays the marriage plot is the narrative's driving force. By the same token, the ballads have Tom Thumb swallowed by a male giant, while Fielding's plays feature a woman, his future bride, who threatens to swallow him up with love on their wedding night - and another female consumer, the enormous cow, who ultimately does. In this sense, Fielding's depiction of a milk-producing cow as a consumer of men functions as the plays' most overt symbol of the detrimental effects for the English husband of the female producer-turned-consumer, especially given contemporary con- cerns that English women's consumption of tea would make them incapable of producing breast milk.37 IV. Even prior to Tom Thumb's death-by-cow, Fielding's excessive use of oral imagery in scenes featuring Huncamunca satirically suggests that the enor- mous appetites of the new female consumer threaten the life and dignity of any Englishman who desires her. In one exchange between Huncamunca and her father, the King finds his daughter in a state of despair, and asks, "What is the Cause? / Say, have you not enough of Meat and Drink? / We've giv'n strict Orders not to have you stinted" (2.4.6-8). "Alas! My Lord," Huncamunca complains, "a tender Maid may want / What she can neither Eat nor Drink -</page><page sequence="11">ARMINTOR- FIELDING'S TOM THUMB PLAYS 79 "(2.4.9-10). "What's that?" inquires the King (2.4.11). "Oh! Spare my Blushes, but I mean a Husband" (2.4.12). In The Tragedy of Tragedies, Fielding extends the joke by having the King console his desirous daughter, "Oh! thou shalt gnaw thy tender Sheets no more, / A Husband thou shalt have to mumble now" (2.4.9-11) - "mumble" meaning "to eat in a slow, ineffective manner, as if without gums" (OED). In both plays, when Tom Thumb says of his bride-to- be that "she shall be mine; / I'll hug, caress, I'll eat her up with Love, Whole Days, and Nights, and Years shall be too short / For our Enjoyment; ev'ry Sun shall rise / Blushing, to see us in our Bed together," the audience is perfectly aware that the opposite is true: it is Huncamunca, of course, the female con- sumer par excellence, who is apt to "eat [him] up with Love" "in [their] Bed together" (2.2.20-23). To perpetuate this sexual satire, Fielding makes use of anal imagery as well. Consider the following speech of Huncamunca's in The Tragedy of Tragedies, in which Fielding underscores the modern suitor's or husband's status as the anal-erotic sexual prop of an insatiable female consumer. Engaged to her beloved Tom Thumb, but having previously promised to marry Grizzle, Hun- camunca laments: I, who this Morn, of two chose which to wed, May go again this Night alone to Bed; So have I seen some wild unsettled Fool, Who had her Choice of this, and that Joint Stool; To give the Preference to either, loath And fondly coveting to sit on both: While the two Stools her Sitting Part confound, Between 'em both fall Squat upon the Ground. (2.10.62-70) Characterizing both the tiny Tom Thumb and his normal-sized rival as inanimate objects on which to position her "sitting part," Huncamunca reveals that she sees all of her male lovers, regardless of height, as virtually indistinguishable commodities, mere sexual props. Simply by wanting to be the husband of this desirous female consumer, Fielding implies, a normal- sized man can shrink to the size and sexual status of a mere Tom Thumb. Vagi- nal and phallic imagery function similarly in another speech of Hunca- munca's, which occurs immediately before their wedding is scheduled to take place. After being eagerly encouraged by the King to impregnate his new bride (a task which, as Grizzle points out, Tom Thumb will have a hard time achieving), an over-excited Tom Thumb exclaims, "I'm so transported, I have lost my self" (2.8.19), upon which Huncamunca responds: Forbid it, all the Stars; for you're so small, That were you lost, you'd find your self no more.</page><page sequence="12">80 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY So the unhappy Sempstress, once, they say, Her Needle in a Pottle, lost, of Hay. In vain she look'd, and look'd, and made her Moan; For ah! The Needle was for ever gone. (2.8.20-21) Given the bawdy dildo jokes leading up to this moment, Huncamunca's comparison of Tom Thumb's small body on their wedding night and a seam- stress's needle lost in a stack of hay underscores his status as a phallic female commodity and instrument of production that her genitals might literally and permanently devour in the act of conjugal intercourse. Although Hunca- munca characterizes the needle's disappearance as a grave misfortune, the implicit joke is that the modern English husband, like the proverbial needle that gets tragically and irrecoverably lost in the haystack, is ironically a com- mon and easily replaceable commodity in the eyes of the new female con- sumer. In The Tragedy of Tragedies, the Queen herself characterizes the husband as a devourable morsel when praising a polygamous giantess named Glumdalca: "Oh happy state of Giantism - where Husbands / Like Mushrooms grow, whilst hapless we are forc'd / to be content, nay happy thought with one" (1.3.32-34). 38 While Fielding's thumb-sized protagonist is warned to "beware of Marriage" to this new breed of woman, his consuming woman laments that the new marriage marketplace is not consumer-friendly enough to suit her appetite for vast quantities of goods. Just as the multiplicity of goods is what most distinguishes the new consumer culture from the old economy, so does the multiplicity of consumable little husbands signify marriage the most advanced and desirable form of marriage for Fielding's caricatured modern woman. V. Both the anthropomorphic dildo poems and their better-known dramatic suc- cessors reveal an aspect of eighteenth-century anxieties over female consump- tion unacknowledged by recent criticism on the literature of nascent con- sumer culture: in these texts, misogynistic anxieties over female consumption are projected not only onto the female body but onto the male body as well. In the Tom Thumb plays, the most striking example of the little man as a symbol of this reversal comes in The Tragedy of Tragedies when Tom Thumb compares himself to a female prostitute while describing his relation to Huncamunca and Glumdalca: In the Balcony that o'er-hangs the Stage, I've seen a Whore two 'Prentices engage; One half a Crown does in his Fingers hold, The other shews a little Piece of Gold;</page><page sequence="13">ARMINTOR- FIELDING'S TOM THUMB PLAYS 81 She the Half Guinea wisely doth purloin, And leaves the larger and the baser Coin. (2.7.28-33) Counterintuitively, the commodified and sexually objectified body here belongs not to a female prostitute but to the future husband of a princess. By extension, the sexual consumers of this little man are in turn the women, Hun- camunca and Glumdalca, with the coins of different sizes and values signify- ing their relative charms. The labor of little men, Fielding suggests, is the voca- tion of every modern husband and male suitor of the new consuming woman, no matter what his class or stature may be. As Grizzle says in The Tragedy of Tragedies , Think'st thou that I will share thy Husband's place, Since to that Office one cannot suffice, And since you scorn to dine one single Dish on, Go, get your Husband put into Commission, Commissioners to discharge, (ye Gods) it fine is, The duty of a Husband to your Highness (2.10.41-46) Employing conspicuously mixed metaphors of oral consumption and menial labor, Grizzle complains that as Huncamunca's "Commissioner to discharge" in the delegated "Office" of husband, as one "put into Commission" to do his "duty," and as a "dish" on which she dines, any husband or suitor of the new consuming woman is but a mere Tom Thumb. For Fielding in the early 1730s, as for Grizzle, the answer to the question of what the modern woman wants in a husband seems to have been "a Lilliput- ian to play with." Even in the case of Fielding's later and more even more famous Tom narrative, Tom Jones , we can see the same dynamics at work in the passage in which Tom gives his beloved Sophia a bird, which she names "little Tommy." "Little Tommy," the narrator informs us, "for so the bird was called, was become so tame, that it would feed out of the hand of its mistress, would perch upon the finger, and lie contented in her bosom, where it seemed almost sensible of its own happiness; though she always kept a small string about its leg, nor would ever trust it with the liberty of flying away."39 As a not-so-dis- tant relative of the Tom Thumb plays, the "little Tommy" anecdote shows that for Fielding the figure of the little man never quite lost its relevance as a metaphor for the modern husband's dubious role in a commodity-oriented culture that engenders a new kind of female desire.40 NOTES My thanks to the anonymous reader for the helpful comments and suggestions. 1.

Recent Fielding criticism has had surprisingly little to say about the author's inter- est in sexual and marital relations between little men and normal-sized women. Criticism on the Tom Thumb plays, from 1918 to the present day, has been primarily concerned with reading the plays as either burlesques of Restoration tragedy or as satires of Walpole and the royal family.

Peter Wagner cites the testimony of Georges-Louis Lesage, a Frenchman who trav- eled through England in 1713-14: "According to this French traveler, who is not identical</page><page sequence="15">ARMINTOR- FIELDING'S TOM THUMB PLAYS 83 with the author of Gil Bias , there were always some women in St. James's Park, London, carrying baskets full of dolls which seemed to be in great demand with the younger ladies. Instead of legs, the dolls sported a cylinder, covered with cloth, which was about six inch- es long and one inch wide. Lesage reports in an anecdote that a young woman found her purchase too big and ordered a smaller one. But the saleswoman insisted on being paid in advance, arguing that she would not be able to sell it, if ever the young lady changed her mind, since only big ones were being asked for."

Rousseau and Roy Porter (Chapel Hill, 1988), 46-68, 53. 14. As Paul Gabriel-Bouc√© notes, the tendency in eighteenth-century English literature to characterize the dildo as an object of French or Italian origin is "a constant linguistic and moralistic reflex in eighteenth-century England: anything 'naughty' may safely be ascribed to those lecherous Continentals." Paul Gabriel-Bouc√©, "Aspects of Sexual Toler- ance and Intolerance in X√úIth-Century England," The British Journal/or Eighteenth-Century Studies 3 (1980): 173-91, 180. 15. While anthropomorphic dildo poetry has yet to be recognized as a sub-genre unto itself, there have been a number of critical writings on seventeenth- and eighteenth-centu- ry dildo literature in general. Roughly speaking, these critical analyses tend to fall into one of two categories: those that situate dildo literature in the context of contemporaneous cul- tural anxieties over depopulation and masturbation (see Wagner and Gabriel-Bouc√©), and those that explore the feminist and anti-feminist implications of texts in which artificial penises are characterized as superior to real ones (see Emma Donoghue, Passions Between Women : British Lesbian Culture , 1668-1801 [New York, 1993]; and Harold Weber, "'Drudg- ing in Fair Aurelia's Womb': Constructing Homosexual Economies in Rochester's Poetry," The Eighteenth Century 33.2 [1992]: 99-117; and Jeffrey Kahan, "Violating Hippocrates: Dil- does and Female Desire in Thomas Nashe's 'The Choice of Valentines'" Para*doxa 2.2 [1996]: 204-16). 16.

David L. Vander Meulen, vol. 46 (Charlottesville, 1993), 250-62. As in "Dildoides," "Signior Dildo" also equates female dildo consumption with idolatry. Addressing female readers, the narrator explains: At the Sign of the Cross in St. James Street, When next you go thither to make yourselves sweet By buying of powder, gloves, essence, or so, You may chance ≈•get a sight of Signior Dildo. You'll take him at first for no person of note Because he appears in a plain leather coat, But when you his virtuous abilities know, You'll fall down and worship Signior Dildo. (253-55) Here, it is Signior Dildo's indefatigable use-value (his "virtuous abilities"), rather than his exchange-value, that make him an object of female worship.</page><page sequence="16">84 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 22.

Literate audiences in Fielding's day who may never have encountered the poems "Monsieur Thing's Origin" and "Dildoides" may have heard of the minor scandal report- ed in the Daily Journal of June 9, 1722 (eight years before Fielding's Tom Thumb), under the headline "Just published, Monsieur Thing; or Seignior D do's Adventures in Great Britain" ( Daily Journal. London, June 9, 1722). The full text of the item reads: "Just pub- lish'd Monsieur Thing; or Seignior D do's Adventures in Great-Britain, at the Pamphlet Shops of London and Westminster, excepting the French Hugonets, who were so unnatu- ral as to refuse their Countryman a Place in their Shop at the Royal-Exchange, which pre- vented others from being sold, as the Author supposes, she had the Original by her and would not suffer herself to be tantaliz'd with the Picture. She sent Constables to suppress the Hawkers." 33. Peter Lewis and J. Paul Hunter have each noted Fielding's use of "completely fatu- ous" and "ludicrously extended" metaphor and simile in the Tom Thumb plays. Lewis claims that its effect is to mock the overly metaphorical language of Restoration tragedy (Lewis, 123). For Hunter, its effect is to show that "metaphor has gone mad, and the artist is shown to have totally lost control of his words" (Hunter, 29). In my reading, Fielding uses bad metaphor to suggest lack of control, not on the part of the artist, but on the part of the characters who utter them. These ludicrous metaphors, in other words, function as pre-Freudian Freudian slips uttered by Tom Thumb and Huncamunca. 34. In The Tragedy of Tragedies, a giantess named Glumdalca joins the cast of lovers and rivals, and falls instantly in unrequited love with Tom Thumb. Launching yet another lit- tle man/big woman scenario, the King falls in love with the giantess at first sight. 35. The two versions of the play differ slightly in their resolution of Tom Thumb's fate: in Tom Thumb, our little hero is eaten by the cow before the marriage can take place; in The Tragedy of Tragedies, the cow consumes him immediately after the wedding. Yet in spite of these differences, one crucial fact remains consistent: in both plays Fielding makes clear that Tom Thumb dies before he and Huncamunca have a chance to consummate their marriage. 36. The ballads' title pages read: "TOM THUMBE, his Life and Death: Wherein is declared many Marvailous Acts of Manhood, full of wonder, and strange merriments" ("Tom Thumb, His Life and Death," Remains of the Early Popular Poetry of England, ed. W. Carew Hazlitt [London, 1866], 167-92, 167). For a reading of Richard Johnson's History of Tom Thumb, a seventeenth-century prose version of the ballads, see Anne Lake Prescott, "The Odd Couple: Gargantua and Tom Thumb," Monster Theory: Reading Culture, ed. Jef- frey Jerome Cohen (Minneapolis, 1996), 75-91. Little is known about the precise origins of Tom Thumb, but W. Carew Hazlitt's Remains of the Early Popular Poetry of England (Lon- don, 1866) provides an informative literary history. Hazlitt surmises that Tom Thumb dates back to the late sixteenth century, citing a reference to a "Treatise of Tom Thumme" in Nash's Pierce Peniless His Supplication to the Devili (1592). Hazlitt cites subsequent refer- ences to Tom Thumb dating from Ben Jonson's reference to Tom Thumb falling into a pud- ding in The Fortunate Isles (1624) to William Wagstaffe's satirical "Comment upon the His- tory of Tom Thumb" (1711). Two years after Fielding wrote The Tragedy of Tragedies, Eliza Haywood and William Hatchett set the play to music in The Opera of Operas (1733), which</page><page sequence="17">ARMINTOR - FIELDING'S TOM THUMB PLAYS 85 was generally faithful to Fielding's dialogue, with the addition of various songs. Jonathan Swift mentions Tom Thumb in "A Tale of a Tub" (The Writings of Jonathan Swift, ed. Robert A. Greenberg and William B. Piper [New York, 1973], 263-371, 299), as does Laurence Sterne in The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy , Gentleman (ed. Melvyn New and Joan New, vol. 1 [Miami, 1978], 41). In the late eighteenth century, children's chapbooks appeared with titles such as Tom Thumb's Folio: Or a New Penny Play-Thing for Little Giants to which is Prefixed an Abstract of the Life of Mr. Thumb and an Historical Account of the Wonder- ful Deeds He Performed (1789). Susan Stewart provides a succinct history of the Tom Thumb legend in On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection (Baltimore, 1988). 37. As Kowaleski-Wallace explains, the new female-oriented tea-drinking culture caused middle- and upper-class women to be thought of as consumers rather than hetero- sexually reproductive producers of children and of the breast milk to sustain them (Kowaleski-Wallace, 34). 38. Glumdalca's name is an obvious reference to Glumdalclitch, Gulliver's giant young mistress in the Brobdingnag section of Swift's Gulliver's Travels. 39. Fielding, The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (Hanover, 1975), 159. 40. Likewise, the plays also show that Fielding's Female Husband (his infamous tale of female cross-dressing and dildo use) is not the author's only flirtation with the dildo as a symbol for the tenuousness of modern masculinity.</page></plain_text>
