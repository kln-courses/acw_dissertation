<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Explanation of Social Behaviour. B3y ROM IIARRE anid PAUL F. SECORD. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1972. Pp. 327-4-vii. ?3.75. Tlahis book is both tempting and tantalizing. 'Tempting' because its main thesis is the liberating notion that it is possible to treat people, for scienti- fic purposes, as if they were human beings. 'Tantalizing' because its approach to the psychological study of man recommends potentially fruitful modes of interpretation without clearly showing how these general recommendations are to be specifically effected in empirical investiga- tions of personal thought and behaviour. The degree of liberation promised by the book will be appreciated by those who are familiar with current social psychological literature. Aca- demic social psychology is, indeed, overwhelmingly artificial, trivial, and banal. The wider human significance even of arresting findings-such as Milgram's discovery that nearly 70 per cent of people are apparently prepared to kill one of their fellows as a punishment for failure in a rote- memory task-is typically obscured by the poverty of psychological interpretation considered appropriate to the experimental situation. This state of affairs is primarily due to the eager acceptance by psycho- logists of a positivist methodology of science which is even less suited to the human condition than it is to natural sciences such as physics. The alternative is to adopt an anthropomorphic model of man, to treat man as man and thus to include psychological phenomena that are recognized by everyday psychological intuitions if not by most professional journals in the field. The collaboration of two authors-one a philosopher of science and the other a social psychologist-allows for the illustration of philosophical points by reference to the empirical literature, and the book should thus interest those who are familiar with only one of these conceptual sources. The philosophical position is basically that expounded more fully in Harre's Principles of Scientific Thlinking, with which readers of Mind are presumably acquainted. Harre's general attack on positivism in science is related to recent work in the philosophy of mind (such as Strawson's account of persons), in order to provide a justification for admitting the fully personal into the domain of the strictly scientific. The philosophical exposition is less careful than that in Harre's longer book, but it is here</page><page sequence="2">472 BOOK REVIEWS juxtaposed with empirical psychological studies which are not discussed in the Principles. (The proof-reading is also less careful: before the book is reprinted, this should certainly receive attention.) In addition, numer- ous examples illustrate how philosophers' analyses of ordinary language terms may be helpful in the design of empirical psychological studies and the clarification of psychological theories. The authors refer to their overall orientation as an 'ethogenic' approach: 'If we follow the paradigm of non-positivist science, explainingbehavioural phenomena involves identifying the generative "mechanisms" that give rise to the behaviour. The discovery and identification of these "mechan- isms" we call ethogeny. We believe that the main process involved in them is self-direction according to the meaning ascribed to the situation' (p. 9). Ethogenic investigation involves the identification of behavioural episodes, and what counts as an episode is basically decided by the mean- ings ascribed to the behaviour in the introspective accounts of the agents participating in it. This also decides on the validity of any particular hypothesis concerning generative mechanisms, or implicit meanings, and the intersubjective agreement of accounts (given by agents and observers) is the court of final appeal where ethogenic hypotheses are to be judged. Harre and Secord draw heavily on the social psychological work of Goffman, Garfinkel, and Schutz, in elaborating their 'common sense' model of man as a rule-following animal. Goffman's writings suggest the importance of the 'dramaturgical standpoint', and contribute to the distinction between 'causal' and 'formal episodes' (roughly: units of behaviour which can be explained without reference to rules or meanings, in contrast to units which cannot). Garfinkel shows the useful- ness of 'disrupting the social fabric to discover in the consequent reaction, its generating rules' as a general methodological technique (p. 150). And Schutz provides a justification for taking seriously the phenomeno- logy of common sense psychological theory, as expressed in people's verbal accounts of what they are up to in their behaviour. This overall conceptual approach is exemplified not only in relation to writers (such as Goffman) of a broadly 'ethogenic' character, but also in discussion of studies conceived within the accepted positivist and opera- tionalist style. For instance, the authors sketch the relevance of their anthropomorphic model of man to the research of Festinger and others on cognitive dissonance, to the work of Rosenthal on experimenter bias, and to that of Milgram on quasi-murderous 'obedience'. In each case they show how experimental conclusions may be vitiated by a design which assumes an oversimple (or even basically nonpsychological) model of the human mind. The point is not that experiments are in principle useless, but that they should be more closely related to the true nature and complexity of everyday psychological phenomena. Harre and Secord provide some pointers indicating ways in which the design of experimental and non-experimental research could be improved. A fuller and more systematic account of this issue would be of great benefit to the develop- ment of social psychology. In surn, Harre and Secord offer a symptomatology, a diagnosis, and a prescription. Most social psychology is trivial; the causative factor is the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 473 professional acceptanice of a positivist methodology radically uinsulited to the study of human nature; and the cure must lie in a psychological science whose basic concepts are allowed to be personal and intensional in type, without prejudice to the scientific status of the associated empirical enquiry. Their symptomatology is ungainsayable, their diagnosis is correct, and in the general character of their prescription lies the only hope of amelioration. Whether their ethogenic manifesto can be clearly spelt out so as to provide the specific details of drug and dosage required by the particular needs of their patient remains to be seen.
