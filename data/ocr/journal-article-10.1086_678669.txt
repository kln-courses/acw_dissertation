      <p>This edited volume provides an expansive and somewhat scattered introduction to the diverse theoretical perspectives and practical approaches that have been applied to the complex task of science communication. Twenty-seven chapters are organized into four parts: What it Helps to Know Beforehand (seven chapters); Policy-Makers, the Media and Public Interest Organisations (seven chapters); What You Can Do and How to Do It (11 chapters); and And Finally, Evaluating and Embedding Science Communication (two chapters).</p>
      <p>The first part is essential reading for scientists, and provides a conceptual overview of how the task of science communication has been approached over the past several decades. Evidence suggests that a “one-way” interaction between scientists and the public (scientists delivering information to an “unknowing” public) is often unsuccessful. In contrast to this so-called “deficit model,” early scientific engagement with the public on its own terms (the so-called “dialogue model”) has shown promise in fostering meaningful and fruitful dialogues on scientific endeavors. Too often, as Lock’s chapter emphasizes, scientists continue to embrace the deficit model of science communication, and fail to consider that their worldviews are not the only way in which scientific knowledge can be framed, and believe that knowledge alone will move the public toward a more scientific perspective. The important messages of the first part seem lost in the second and third parts of the edited volume, which emphasize practical issues and strategies. Some of the chapters in Part II would have been strengthened through inclusion of the large body of empirical research on how science learning occurs. Indeed, some of the recommendations (e.g., the use of anthropomorphism and metaphor in science communication) are known to be problematic, particularly in the context of communicating evolutionary concepts. Nevertheless, the bulk of the second part is likely to spur innovative ideas on how to effectively engage with the public through media, science festivals, and other activities. The brief final part of the book provides an accessible overview of how to determine whether a particular activity or event has achieved its intended goals.</p>
      <p>Overall, this edited volume provides many perspectives that will most likely be surprising to scientists, perhaps explaining why science communication is so often unsuccessful.</p>
