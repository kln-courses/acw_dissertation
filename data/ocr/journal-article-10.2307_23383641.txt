The excavation was directed by Shlomo Goldschmidt on behalf of the Israel Department of Antiquities. Few fragmentary architectural features and sediment accumulations were exposed, containing a fairly large quantity of Chalcolithic finds. The excavation was never published, even though the site was re-surveyed in the late 1970's by R. Gophna. This paper presents a final excavation report of the 1955 excavation, and deals with the site's chronological position along the northern Chalcolithic cultural sequence. It turns out, as was already claimed by Sadeh and Gophna following the survey results, that the site's ceramic typology represents a transition between pre-Ghassulian and Ghassulian Chalcolithic horizons.</page><page sequence="2">420 URI DAVIDOVICH &amp; YOSEF GARFINKEL excluding the site's brief mention in N. Tsori's survey of the Beth-Shean area (site 100; Tsori 1958, 1962), the excavation was forgotten and the finds were never published. Even when the site was re-surveyed by R. Gophna in the late 1970's, and a relatively small ceramic assemblage from that survey was published and discussed in detail (Sadeh and Gophna 1991), the surveyors did not refer to the 1955 excavation, which had yielded a much larger amount of Chalcolithic pottery that was stored in the IAA storehouses. In the course of the renewed excavations at Tel Tsaf, and the on-going research project conducted by one of the authors (Y.G.) regarding the proto-historic sequence in the Central Jordan Valley, it was decided to publish a final report on the 1955 excavation of the Sde Eliyahu Water-Reservoir. In this paper we present the available material from the excavation, and discuss the pottery assemblage, the main category of finds from the excavation, against the typo-chronological background of the Chalcolithic period in the Central Jordan Valley. We shall argue that typologically the assemblage has both Pre-Ghassulian - Middle Chalcolithic in our terminology (Garfinkel 1999, 153-199) - and Ghassulian Chalcolithic attributes, and therefore should be regarded as "transitional" between these two chrono-cultural units. The same general conclusion was reached by Sadeh and Gophna (1991) based upon the latter's survey collection only. The current research is based on the material kept in the IAA storehouses in Beth Shemesh, which include six boxes of pottery and few other finds from the site, and on the documentation found in the IAA archive in the Rockefeller Museum. The latter includes the following documents: 1. A memorandum written by N. Tsori to S. Yeivin, then the director of the Department of Antiquities, regarding the discovery of the site and the necessity to perform a salvage excavation (Tsori 1955). 2. One page written by S. Goldschmidt, the excavator, in which he summarizes the excavation (Goldschmidt 1955). 3. A memorandum written by M. Prausnitz after visiting the excavation (Prausnitz 1955). 4. Five untitled field photographs taken by Tsori on 11.2.1955, in the middle of the excavation, and another photo taken at an unknown location at the beginning of the excavation. 5. A measured plan of the excavation area, drawn by a surveyor from the kibbutz, as no surveyor was sent by the Department of Antiquities (Goldschmidt 1955). 6. A catalogue notebook containing a list of over 900 finds collected during the excavation and recorded after an initial sorting. The numbers in the catalogue generally match those written on the finds which were kept in the storehouses. All these documents, as well as others which mention later visits to the site and archaeological work in its vicinity (see below), are found in a file designated "Sde-Eliyahu, Water-Reservoir". This is the official name of the site, though the excavator had coined it "the Sde-Eliyahu ridge site" The excavation permit number, given retroactively by the IAA, is &amp;-9/1955.</page><page sequence="3">SDE-ELIYAHU WATER-RESERVOIR 421 THE SITE AND THE EXCAVATION The site of Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir is located on a moderate slope, which divides the Central Jordan Valley in the area of Beth-Shean into two distinct "terraces" - the "Beth-Shean terrace" to the west and the "Ghor terrace" to the east (grid ref. 19738/20565, according to the excavators survey; Figure 1). The slope is part of a 20-40 m high step which developed along the western marginal fault of the Dead Sea Rift during the terminal Pleistocene and the Holocene due to tectonic activity (Zilberman et al. 2004). The slope is built of tufa sediments of the Bet She'an formation, deposited during the late Pleistocene prior to the tectonic movements (Zilberman et al. 2004). Both west and east of the escarpment, the tufa layers are covered by 1-5 m thick colluvium. The nearest natural spring is situated some 700 m east of the site, although it is possible that in the past other permanent water sources existed even closer to the site. The archaeological potential of the site was first discovered at the beginning of January 1955 by several members of Kibbutz Sde-Eliyahu, led by S. Goldschmidt, during the construction of a water reservoir for the settlement (Goldschmidt 1955; Tsori 1955). N. Tsori, then inspector of the Department of Antiquities in the Beth-Shean area, visited the site and observed two ancient pits, cut by a modern trench. The pits contained pottery sherds and flints which were preliminarily dated by M. Stekelis to the Chalcolithic period (Tsori 1955). Later, it turned out that the relevant layers had already been removed at the foundations of the reservoir itself (Prausnitz 1955). As a result, the archaeological excavation, which began at the end of that month, concentrated around the modern trench and the pits observed in it, some 50-70 m east of the reservoir. The excavation lasted two weeks (31.1-14.2.1955), and was carried out with the assistance of 8-10 workers, supervised by Goldschmidt. The excavation extended over an area of 100 m2, with 41.5 m2 to the northeast of the trench and 58.5 m2 to its southwest (Figure 2). The excavator defined four main stratigraphie elements, described here from top to bottom (Goldschmidt 1955): a. Topsoil layer (c. 0-30 cm below original surface), in which were found "sherds of different periods" (the excavator does not specify which periods exactly; but see below). b. Layered accumulation of carbonate sediments (which he terms 'sinter surfaces'), naturally deposited, which contained Chalcolithic pottery (c. 30-60 cm below topsoil in the eastern part, and 30-100 cm in the western part). c. "Living floor" of the Chalcolithic period, consisting of a roughly horizontal layer of the natural tufa, of which the whole ridge is built (see above). This layer also forms the bed rock of the site. d. Fragmentary architectural features found in relation to the "living floor", and pits that were dug from the latter into the tufa bed-rock. Within this sequence, the definition of the second element is somewhat unclear. In the catalogue of finds from the excavation Goldschmidt refers to three 'surfaces' as part of the</page><page sequence="4">422 UK1 davidovich &amp; yosef garfinkel HUfl m'm ' 0 -ShUnaN"/ Figure 1.

The presented plan is a reproduced copy of the original plan, drawn by a surveyor from the Kibbutz (courtesy of the Israel Antiquities Authority archive). loci to which the finds are related, but the meaning of these 'surfaces5 and their stratigraphie and spatial location is not presented anywhere else. It seems that this term is used to define different levels inside the natural/anthropogenic layered accumulation found above the "living floor". In any case, the excavator discerned only one occupational phase within the stratigraphie sequence described above, that is the "living floor" and the man-made features associated with it. This conclusion seems to be concordant with the similarity of the pottery assemblages collected from the different contexts, i.e., the accumulations above the "living floor"floor" and inside the pits, as recorded in the catalogue of finds (and see below). The architectural features found in the excavation include the already-mentioned two pits, which extend from the trench to the northeast, a semi-circular wall fragment built of "stones and bricks", and another shallow depression hewn into the tufa bedrock to the southwest of the trench (Figure 2). The contour of the pits is irregular. The length of the larger, northwestern pit is c. 2.1 m (apart from the segment that was demolished by the trench), and its width measures 1.7 m (Figure 3). The dimensions of the southeastern pit are somewhat</page><page sequence="6">424 11111 davidovich &amp; yosef garfinkel -*Â» ** *&gt;V Figuer 3.

The lower terrace of the Central Jordan Valley (the Ghor) is seen in the background (courtesy of Israel Antiquities Authority archive). smaller, its preserved length is c. 1.5 m, and its width is 1.2 m. The depth of both pits is c. 0.9 m, and they are not lined nor coated with any material. Neither the nature of the fragmentary wall, nor its stratigraphie relationship with the pits, is discussed by the excavator. The boundaries of Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir site are hard to determine. The documented correspondence discussed above mentions the existence of Chalcolithic pottery also near the reservoir itself, and in other small soundings that were made during the construction works. Similar evidence was reported in a few later instances, when further archaeological investigations in the area took place. While digging probes using mechanical equipment along the step from Tel Rehov southwards, most probably in 1974, a few sherds characteristic of the Chalcolithic period were reported by C. Epstein c. 150 m north of the location of the 1955 excavation (Epstein 1974). In October 1977, P. Porath, then inspector of the Department of Antiquities in the area, wrote a memorandum regarding Chalcolithic pottery sherds, among them a possible churn fragment, found inside a trench dug in order to repair a damaged water-pipe; the grid reference given is located some 250 m southeast of the 1955 excavation area, in the Ghor plain (Porath 1977a). More sherds and flints were collected from the area around the reservoir a month afterwards, during a survey conducted by R.</page><page sequence="7">SDE-ELIYAHU WATER-RESERVOIR 425 Gophna and group of students from Tel-Aviv University, accompanied by Porath (Porath 1977b). The pottery assemblage from this survey was later published by Sadeh &amp; Gophna (1991). Finally, it should be mentioned that Chalcolithic pottery was found also in a recent survey of Shlukhot map (in the course of the Survey of Israel), along the natural escarpment and in proximity to the reservoir (A. Cohen-Tavor, personal communication). When summing up the evidence, it appears that a large Chalcolithic site is spread around the 1955 excavation area. However, two important reservations should be noted: first, it is possible that some of the "find-spots" are composed of sherds and flints that had moved from their original deposition locations in the course of time; second, since the Central Jordan Valley is known to be 'packed' with Proto-historic sites (e.g., Tsori 1958), it is possible that the various find-spots represent several sites, differing from each other spatially and/or chronologically. This reservation also applies to the 1977 survey results published by Sadeh and Gophna (1991). Those scholars based their conclusions on an insecure, unstratified collection of sherds, which could have been originated from several phases of a multi-strata site, or from a few small sites. Moreover, a surface collection does not embody in most cases a a complete assemblage of a single cultural phase, another factor which can mislead a typo chronological evaluation of the site. With this in mind, we abstain from estimating the size of the Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir site and its exact boundaries. The assemblage collected in the 1955 excavation will be dealt with independently, and will form the basis for the chrono cultural evaluation of the site in its original and limited spatial definition. THE POTTERY OF THE 1955 EXCAVATION When examining both the finds kept from the excavation and the catalogue of finds, it seems that the recovery of artifacts during the excavation was done in accordance with the methods used in those days. The sediments were not sifted, and only large pottery fragments and few flint and stone artifacts were kept and documented. According to the catalogue, the majority of the finds from the excavation are Chalcolithic pottery sherds (above 90% of the total). Later pottery, mainly Byzantine, constitutes another 5% of the finds, but most of it was discarded at the end of the excavation (only seven unindicative sherds were found in the stored boxes). The rest of the finds, which form less than 3% of the total assemblage, are other Chalcolithic artifacts, mostly flints and ground-stone vessels, to be described below. Over 800 Chalcolithic pottery fragments were recorded in the catalogue, but only 627 of them were found in the IAA storehouses. This bulk is comprised of 113 body sherds and small unindicative rim pieces, 161 bases or base fragments, 126 handles and 233 indicative sherds, mostly rims (with few churn handles and chalice fragments); four specimens were defined as other clay artifacts. It seems that most of the body sherds were thrown away during preliminary sorting, and only a few, mainly decorated fragments were kept and</page><page sequence="8">426 uri davidovich &amp; yosef garfinkel catalogued. On the other hand, it is fairly reasonable to assume that most of the 'special' and indicative sherds - bases, handles and rim fragments - were kept, an assumption which forms the basis for the statistical analysis of the assemblage. It should be emphasized that the Chalcolithic pottery retrieved from the different contexts, as recorded by the excavator in the catalogue, shows the same typological and technological traits, and therefore can be viewed as representing one chronological stage. Before concentrating on the typological aspect of the pottery, a few technological characteristics should be pointed out. All types are hand-made, including small straight-sided bowls, which in some nearby Chalcolithic sites are frequently wheel-fashioned (e.g., at Abu Hamid; Roux and Courty 1997). The overwhelming majority of vessels and vessel-types are made of coarse ware, containing fairly large amounts of temper, either light (carbonates?) or dark-colored (basalt?), with a maximum size reaching 5 mm in the cruder vessels. The color spectrum of the clay is wide, ranging from yellowish-grey to reddish-brown. Only a few small bowls and holemouth jars are made of well-levigated, beige-to-pink clay. These examples also share relatively thin walls compared to the rest of the vessels. The typological division of the vessels in the Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir pottery assemblage is rather difficult for two main reasons. The first is the almost total absence of complete vessel forms, or even large parts of upper body and rim sherds. Second, as mentioned above, the industry is totally hand-made, causing a large variety in rim forms in each general type and on the 'border' between two close types (e.g. ,between holemouth jar with raised rim and bag-shaped jar with very short neck). Therefore, our typology was deliberately limited to few general types, applied also to the statistical analysis (Table 1). The table presents the total number of indicative fragments counted in each type, and the type's relative incidence in the assemblage. In the last column we compare our local typology to a comprehensive typological study of the two relevant chrono-cultural phases, i.e., the northern Middle Chalcolithic (comprised mostly of sites in the Jordan Valley; Garfinkel 1999: 154 199) and the Late (Ghassulian) Chalcolithic (Garfinkel 1999: 200-275).

The majority of the bowls are red-slipped on both the inside and outside faces, while some are slipped on one side only; a relatively small number of bowls is not slipped at all. Two other features are sometimes applied to the outer faces of these bowls, a strip of rope decoration (Figure 4:12) and strap handles (Figure 4:8). Both small bowls, with a diameter measuring 14 cm and less, and very large bowls, with diameter exceeding 30 cm, are rather rare in the assemblage. As mentioned above, some of the small bowls are made of well-levigated clay containing few inclusions. Small and large bowls are also characterized by the use of red slip on both faces (Figure 4:1-3, 15). Three of the large bowls have somewhat flaring rims, in contrast to the usual straight-sided profile. The rest of the open forms are also characterized by straight-sided or slightly rounded profiles. These include basins, which differ from the medium-sized and large bowls mainly in the thickness of their rims, which equals or exceeds that of their walls (Figure 5:1-4); one intact small shallow platter with flaring rims, which continues a Wadi Raba tradition (Figure 5:5; Figure 6; Garfinkel 1999: 122-123); one complete lid with raised knob handle (Figure 5:6; Figure 7); and one medium-sized bowl with rounded body and a spouted strainer attached below the rim (Figure 5:7). To this list we may add the four chalice fragments, which exhibit mainly the joint between the bowl and the high base (Figure 5:8), with one fragment of a fenestrated pedestal (Figure 5:9). It should be noted that none of these vessels is red slipped, and only the basins are decorated with other, various decoration forms (applied rope decoration, thumb impressions on rim, a strip of drop incisions; Figure 5:2-4). Holemouth jars are the dominant group among the closed forms.

All three types are characterized by relatively open shapes, with the upper part curving inwards only slightly The simple holemouth jars feature simple, pointed or rounded rims, and they occur in a variety of sizes (rim diameter ranges between 9 and 30 cm; Figure 8). Red-slip is a common decoration form in this type, as well as delicate rope decoration below the rim (Figure 8:10-11). The second type, the holemouth jar with a raised rim, is characterized by the same rim forms and decoration techniques. The rim part is separated from the vessel's body by means of soft or sharp carination, in a manner that leaves no more than 0.5 cm to the part above the carination, which may be vertical or even everted (Figure 9). This type is actually the most common closed form in the Sde-Eliyahu assemblage, an impression which becomes even more significant when taking into account the resemblance between the holemouth jar with raised rim and the bag-shaped jar with an extremely low neck, the most frequent jar type (see below).</page><page sequence="14">432 UR1 DAVIDOVICH &amp; YOSEF GARFINKEL a \ / I \ 10 11 0 5 10 No. Excavation No. Type Decoration and comments 1 no number simple holemouth high-quality red slip and burnish, inside and outside 2 294 simple holemouth undecorated 3 544 simple holemouth undecorated 4 325 simple holemouth red slip, inside and outside 5 776 simple holemouth red slip, inside and outside 6 668 simple holemouth undecorated 7 841 simple holemouth undecorated 8 209, 232 simple holemouth undecorated 9 no number simple holemouth traces of color on rim, inside and outside 10 528 simple holemouth incised fingernail impressed near the rim 11 153 simple holemouth red slip and rope decoration, outside; red strip on internal rim Figure 8.

This type differs from the previous two in the overall massiveness of the vessel and in that its rim thickness is equal to or larger than the wall thickness. All the specimens belonging to this type share a relatively open shape and a wide aperture. The rims are either square, widening inward or outward, and sometimes grooved to form a kind of ,'gutter" rim (Figure 10:1-2). In most cases, there is a strip of applied rope decoration below the rim; red slip is found only in the smallest specimen belonging to this type (Figure 10:3). Jars constitute the other major group of closed vessels in the assemblage. Two main forms can be distinguished: a bag shaped jar with a very low neck, and a 'regular' low-necked jar. The first type is in fact the continuation of the holemouth jar with a raised rim, however here the rim is more prominent and a short neck is developed (Figure 11:1-6). There is a large variety of sizes within this type, but all share the same basic form of slumped shoulders and everted rims. Red slip is occasionally found on both the outer side of the vessel and the upper part of its inner side. The second type of jar has a more elaborate neck, though still low (not more than 5 cm between the carination and the rim), and the rims flare outwards more pronouncedly (Figure 11:7-10). Decoration includes red-slip or applied rope strip on the shoulder. Three items were defined as miscellaneous closed vessels. One is a small jar with high, straight-sided flaring neck (Figure 12:1). Another item is either ajar with very high neck, or an elongated holemouth jar, with a loop handle attached to the body (Figure 12:2). The third example is part of a very wide and massive vessel, possibly a half-closed pithos resembling the thickened rim holemouth type (Figure 12:3). None of these specimens is decorated. The last type in the assemblage, identified only through two typical handle fragments, is the churn (Figure 12:4-5). No rims which could have been positively related to this type were found. Both handles belong to the rounded edge of the churn's body, and they seem to Figure 10. Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir pottery, 1955 excavation: holemouth jars with thickened rim.

The Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir assemblage includes 126 handles. Of these, three were already discussed: two churn handles, and a vertical knob handle of a lid (Figure 5:6; Figure 7). The 123 fragments left may be classified into three types: a lug handle (one specimen; Figure 13:1), strap loop handles (n=64) and loop handles with a round hole (n=58). The two major types differ in the cross-section - flat in the former (Figure 13:2-5), triangular or rounded in the latter (Figure 13:6-12). The loop handles with the round hole, though resembling the pierced handles typical of the Ghassulian Chalcolithic, are truly pierced only in very few instances {e.g. Figure 13:8). Of the 161 base fragments counted in the assemblage, 136 are attributed to the common flat base type (Figure 14:1-12). In most cases, the thickness of the base is homogenous in section, but in some of the bases there is a minor bulge in the middle of the base (Figure 14: 10-12). It is not clear if and how this bulge is related to the manufacturing technique of the vessels. Other types of bases which appear in the assemblage are disk base (n=18; Figure 14: 13-14) and ring base (n=7; Figure 14:15), neither significantly pronounced. Two specimens show distinct surface manipulations on the lower part of the body immediately above the base, one in the form of incised drops, possibly made using a hollow reed, and the other in the form of short incised lines (Figure 14:1-2; Figure 15). Decoration is applied to 249 sherds of the total assemblage. Since most of the pottery from the excavation was not kept after the initial sorting, the frequency of decoration in general and of each decoration form in particular can not be calculated in regard to the whole assemblage. Nevertheless, we may state few introductory remarks regarding the various decoration forms, before dealing with the relative distribution of the various decoration techniques per vessel type, analyzed through the examination of indicative fragments only.</page><page sequence="20">43 8 davidovich &amp; yosef garfinkel 17 r Â¥ 0' W 5 10 No. Excavation No. Type Comments 1 532 jar jar - varia jar with high and straight-sided neck 2 no number jar jar - varia extremely high-necked jar or elongated holemouth 3 19 jar jar - varia pithos? large krater? 4 389 churn pointed edge handle 5 247 churn pointed edge handle Figure 12.

It is likely that red slip was applied to even more vessels in the present assemblage, but deteriorated and became unrecognizable in the course of time, as it is often visible only as traces of slip. Only three sherds have both red-slip and burnish, in a tradition reminiscent of the Wadi Raba culture (e.g. Garfinkel 1999: 142). Other decoration forms include strips of applied rope decoration (n=37), thumb-impressed rims (n=4) and bands of incised or impressed decoration (n=6). In a number of cases a combination of two decoration forms is visible on one vessel (Figure 4:12; Figure 5:2, 5; Figure 14:2). Table 2 shows the distribution of the different decoration forms in relation to the vessel type categories, not including all decorated sherds which are not indicative typologically. Figure 14.

Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir pottery, 1955 excavation: two bases decorated with incised patterns. This table should not be considered without reservation, mainly with regard to the red slip numbers (see above), but some tendencies may be observed. First and foremost, the overall percentage of decorated sherds in the indicative assemblage is very high (123 out of 233 sherds; 52.8%). The red-slipped sherds alone make up 46.4% of the total number of all indicative sherds. Secondly, it can be clearly seen that red slip decoration is far more common in the open vessels. It should be noted that 59 of the 63 red-slipped bowls are slipped both inside and outside, while most of the closed forms are slipped on the outside and on the upper part of the interior. Finally, it is also clear that the cruder vessels, such as basins and holemouth jars with thickened rims, are almost totally lacking of any red slip, but are often decorated with strips of rope decoration, either applied, impressed on rim or incised.

The handle itself is rather irregular, since its hole is relatively small comparing to the massiveness of the handle. Therefore, it is hard to reconstruct the original position of the handle, or to connect it to a specific type of vessel. The anthropomorphic shape was achieved by perforating two small holes, one on each side of the handle's main ridge, and by cutting that same ridge slightly below the holes, as if to create a a pronounced nose. The handle is broken immediately below this cut, and it is uncertain whether a mouth or other features were shaped at the bottom of the handle. Four additional ceramic artifacts appear in the assemblage. Two of them may be termed 'stoppers', as they are pieces of pottery re-used and shaped in an approximately round form, possibly to serve as lids (Figure 16:2-3). The other two items are probably parts of one vessel; they share very thick cross-sections, coarse clay and unsmoothed surfaces (Figure 16:4-5). The original artifact could have been either a model of some kind, a large container or even an open mould, but there is no way to reconstruct its complete shape using these pieces alone. Two ceramic spindle whorls are mentioned in the catalogue of finds (n. 114 and 894), the latter is even sketched as having a bi-conical shape, but they were not found in the stored boxes. The flint assemblage includes 15 large items. Of these there are six flakes, three blades (all broken) and six tools. It is clear that the flint "assemblage" does not represent a systematic collection of flints during the excavation. The six tools are described here briefly, and five of them are presented in Figures 18-19: 1. A complete adze, relatively short and wide in proportions (IAANo. 55-111; Figure 18:1). It bears polish marks on the working edges.</page><page sequence="26">444 URI DAVIDOVICH &amp; YOSHF GARFINKEL I I 0 2 4 Figure 16.

This item is broken and most of it is missing, thus it is not clear whether it was made on a flake or on a blade. The stone assemblage is also quite small. It includes six items, four of which are made of basalt, one of another volcanic, very porous rock (possibly scoria), and the sixth is a limestone pebble, possibly used as a weight (Figure 20:6). The basalt objects include three fragments of bowls with smoothed surfaces (Figure 20:1-3), and one broken, flat pebble which might have served as a small pounding palette (Figure 20:4). The scoria pebble (Figure 20:5) might have been used in grinding. It should be noted that two other grinding stones are mentioned in the catalogue (n. 112 and 895), but they were not found among the stored finds. One complete sea shell was also found in the excavation. It was identified by D. Bar-Yosef as Glycymeris insubrica, originating from the Mediterranean (n. 286 in the catalogue). DISCUSSION The 1955 excavation at the site of Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir does not enable thorough comprehension of many aspects concerning the site's nature and material culture. However, the excavation did yield a sizeable and rather unique pottery assemblage, which most probably originates in one single occupational episode.</page><page sequence="28">446 uri davidovich &amp; yosef garfinkel n Figure 18.

Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir, 1955 excavation: stone artifacts. There is no doubt that most of the pottery types, such as straight-sided bowls, basins, chalices, lids, simple holemouth jars, low necked jars and churns appear in typical Ghassulian sites, in the central Jordan Valley as well as in other regions. Of the nearby excavated sites, we may mention the upper levels at Abu-Hamid (Dollfus and Kafafi 1986, 1988, 1993) and at Jebel Sartaba south of Pella (McNicoll et al. 1982; Smith and Hanbury-Tenison 1992), Tel Ali stratum la (Garfinkel 1992) and Gesher Quarantine Station (Covallo-Paran 1997) as sites in which parallels to these vessels were found. But, at the same time, other typical Ghassulian Chalcolithic types are totally absent from the Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir assemblage, such as small wheel-fashioned straight-sided bowls, goblets, multiple-handled jars and high necked jars. Moreover, regional features of the Ghassulian pottery, like the shallow platter and the huge pithos (Garfinkel 1998; Tsori 1967), are also not present. To this list we may add the absence of red-painted bands on the rims of bowls, a feature known as "lipstick" decoration, which is rather common in Ghassulian Chalcolithic assemblages. On the other hand, the Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir assemblage does include typological features which are rare or non-existent in Ghassulian contexts: the holemouth jar with a raised rim, the bag-shaped jar with an extremely low neck, the appearance of rope decoration and broad strip handles on the exterior of medium-sized bowls, and the rather large number of loop</page><page sequence="31">SDE-ELIYAHUSDE-ELIYAHU WATER-RESERVOIR 449 handles, some of which broaden considerably in the attachments to the vessel's body. All these features are, in fact, characteristics of pre-Ghassulian, Middle Chalcolithic assemblages from the Jordan Valley and other areas, and are found in sites such as Tel esh-Shuna North (de-Contenson 1960; Gustavson-Gaube 1985, 1986), Tel Abu-Habil (de-Contenson 1960), Tel Ali stratum lb (Garfinkel 1992) and Tel Tsaf (Gophna and Sadeh 1989). Nevertheless, Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir site can not be placed entirely within this chronological frame, since it already shows features which are found only (or mostly) in the next, Ghassulian phase of the Chalcolithic, for example the churn, the pierced handle with triangular profile and triangular cross-section, and the thumb-impressed rim. Furthermore, few characteristics of the Middle Chalcolithic phase, such as the swollen-necked jar, the bow-rim jar and the carinated bowl (the latter two are in fact remnants of the Wadi Raba tradition which appear for the last time in Middle Chalcolithic contexts), are not present at the assemblage at all. The distinct "Tel Tsaf decoration" of the Jordan Valley Middle Chalcolithic (Gophna and Sadeh 1989) is also totally absent, though Tel Tsaf is located only 6 km southeast of Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir site. On the whole, it seems that the Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir pottery assemblage should be viewed as a transitional assemblage between the pre-Ghassulian and Ghassulian ceramic horizons of the Central Jordan Valley. As such, it may be parallel to specific phases which precede the Ghassulian Chalcolithic at multi-strata sites excavated in the region, for example the "middle levels'5 (or part of these levels) at Abu-Hamid (Lovell et al. 1997, 2004)1, plot M lower phase at Jebel Sartaba (Lovell 2000; Smith and Hanbury-Tenison 1992) or part of stratum XIII sequence in area XXXIID at Pella (Lovell 2000). Unfortunately, the exact correlation between these sites and the Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir site can not be reached for the moment due both to the limited amount of pottery that was published from the sites, and the lack of stratigraphie details and radiometric dating from Sde-Eliyahu Water Reservoir site. In conclusion, it turns out that Sadeh and Gophna's (1991) verdict concerning the typo chronological position of the site match the analysis results of the excavation assemblage. Nevertheless, we still believe that uncontrolled, random collection of sherds in an area dense with Chalcolithic activity, should not form the sole evidence for such a precise chronological evaluation. In any case, the Sde-Eliyahu Water-Reservoir site forms another important constituent in our understanding of the rich cultural sequence of the Central Jordan Valley during the Proto-historical periods. 1. The stratigraphy of Abu-Hamid and its chrono-cultural implications, as presented in recent works (e.g. Dollfus and Kafafi 2001: 167 ; Lovell et al. 1997, 2004), is not accepted by the authors, but these problems will be dealt with elsewhere (meanwhile see Banning 2002: 152-153; Garfinkel 1999: 158).</page><page sequence="32">450 UR1 DAVIDOVICH &amp; YOSEF GARFINKEL ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank H.
