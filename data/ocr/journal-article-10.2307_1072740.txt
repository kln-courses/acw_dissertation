<plain_text><page sequence="1">CORPORATE STANDING TO ALLEGE RACE DISCRIMINATION IN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIONS The Reconstruction Congresses that passed the fourteenth amendment and the Civil Rights Acts' doubtless perceived race discrimination as an evil affecting physical, not jural, persons.2 More recently, courts interpret- ing these provisions have recognized that corporations, like "real" per- sons, may be harmed by racial bigotry.3 Yet no clear doctrinal basis has emerged for granting corporations standing4 to assert race discrimination claims. Courts have usually allowed corporate litigants to press these claims, sometimes invoking the associational rights of the corporation or its members," elsewhere stressing the need to vindicate the rights of third I U.S. Const. amend. XIV; 42 U.S.C. ?? 1981, 1983, 1985, 2000d (1976). Other provisions might be included under the label "Civil Rights Acts"; the above sections are, however, the provisions most easily adapted to remedying harm suffered by corporations from race discrimination. See infra notes 76-81 and accompanying text. 3 See Hudson Valley Freedom Theater, Inc. v. Heimbach, 671 F.2d 702, 706 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 103 S. Ct. 127 (1982); T &amp; S Serv. Assocs. v. Crenson, 666 F.2d 722, 724-25 (1st Cir. 1981). See also Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 477-78 (1980) (plurality opinion) (interpreting Public Works Employment Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. ? 6705(f)(2) (Supp. V 1981)). Corporations might also suffer discrimination based on gender or national origin. Never- theless, civil rights claims based on these harms have been almost nonexistent. The notable exception is NOW v. Goodman, 374 F. Supp. 247, 250 (S.D.N.Y. 1974), in which standing was denied the plaintiff National Organization for Women. 4 Unless otherwise indicated, "standing" in this note refers to the ability of parties to assert particular legal rights. This sort of "prudential" standing question does not arise un- less the party seeking a hearing has already met constitutional standing requirements, such as injury in fact that is "likely to be redressed by a favorable decision." Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38 (1976). See also Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59 (1978); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975); United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669 (1973). 1f By pegging corporate standing to associational rights, the Supreme Court has on occa- sion transformed equal protection/race discrimination claims into first amendment disputes. Compare NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 444 (1963) ("Because our disposition is rested on the First Amendment as absorbed in the Fourteenth, we do not reach the considerations of race or racial discrimination which are the predicate of petitioner's challenge to the statute under the Equal Protection Clause.") with id. at 445-46 (Douglas, J., concurring) ("This Virginia Act . . . reflects a legislative purpose to penalize the N.A.A.C.P. because it pro- motes desegregation of the races. . . . Discrimination also appears on the face of this Act."). See also NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449 (1958) (Court invoked associa- tional rights to prevent disclosure of NAACP membership lists). More recently, some courts have argued that associational harm suffered by a corporation's members may provide 1153</page><page sequence="2">1154 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 69:1153 parties.6 Neither of these approaches is satisfactory, however. Racial bigotry targeted at the corporation itself does not implicate corporate rights of free association.7 Third-party standing, though often granted, is both dis- cretionary with the court8 and arguably dependent on the legal status of the third parties involved.' Moreover, the third parties themselves are often unable to pursue discrimination claims: shareholders, for example, may not recover under the Civil Rights Acts for harm to the corporation they own.10 As a result, race discrimination directed at businesses owned or operated by minorities may be insufficiently deterred. If a corporation could assert its own right to be free from race discrimi- nation independent of the rights of its shareholders and employees, the uncertainty surrounding corporate standing under the fourteenth amend- ment and the Civil Rights Acts would disappear. Instead of depending on discretionary judgments by courts, corporate targets of discrimination could rely on the same automatic standing granted to individual victims. Such an approach is consistent with most corporate standing results; its chief effect would be to give those results a firmer legal foundation. The sole obstacle to granting corporations standing directly has been judicial reluctance to attribute racial character to something so incorpo- real as a business enterprise. Like a natural person, a corporation may be the target of race discrimination, whether because of the color of its mem- standing for the corporation to assert a private civil rights claim. See, e.g., NOW v. Sperry Rand Corp., 457 F. Supp. 1338, 1342 (D. Conn. 1978). O Des Vergnes v. Seekonk Water Dist., 601 F.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1979), vacated and re- manded on other grounds sub nom. Heritage Homes, Inc. v. Seekonk Water Dist., 454 U.S. 807 (1981). 7 Logically, a corporation can have an associational rights claim in its own right only where the complained-of act deters it from associating with someone. Hence, on those rare occasions where courts have recognized nonderivative corporate associational rights, the cor- poration invariably has suffered discrimination aimed at individuals, and not just itself. In NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1962), for example, Virginia's legal malpractice statute apparently sought to deter certain kinds of litigation and accordingly limited the NAACP's right to associate with prospective litigants. See id. at 428-29 (majority opinion); id. at 445- 46 (Douglas, J., concurring). 8 E.g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975). See generally 1 C.

In each in- stance, the corporation suffers racially motivated injury, yet in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,"1 the United States Supreme Court said in dictum that a corporation has no racial identity and cannot bring a claim in its own right.'2 The Court's statement appears to bar the one approach that might both explain the results of past cases and provide certainty for future ones. This note reconsiders the Arlington Heights dictum and finds it want- ing. After analyzing the alternative approaches that courts have taken and might take to standing in corporate race discrimination cases, the note discusses Arlington Heights and subsequent federal cases in which corporate plaintiffs alleged race discrimination. It then briefly examines the legislative history of the fourteenth amendment and Civil Rights Acts, finding that the framers of those provisions neither anticipated nor resolved the standing question. Next, the note analyzes analogous situa- tions where the law either requires or prohibits attribution of personal characteristics of shareholders or employees to corporations. Drawing on these parallel areas of the law, the note concludes that corporations often acquire racial identity in fact and therefore should have standing to base claims on that identity in law.13 I. JUDICIAL CONSIDERATION OF THE STANDING QUESTION A. Alternative Roads to Standing Courts might grant corporations standing to assert discrimination claims using any of three doctrinal methods. First, courts might allow a corporation to assert the rights of natural persons, such as shareholders, 1 429 U.S. 252 (1977). " Id. at 263. 13 Ascription of racial character to corporations may pose difficult definitional questions. Courts may have to decide whether a corporation is sufficiently associated with a racial minority to raise a race discrimination claim. Questions of what percentage of a corpora- tion's directors or workforce must be members of a racial minority before a corporation shares in their racial identity are likely to be perplexing. They are not the subject of this note. Because civil rights is a matter of longstanding federal interest, such definitional problems are proper issues for federal common law. Cf. Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U.S. 363, 366-67 (1943) (federal common law governs question of whether delay bars an action by the United States to recover on a forged check innocently cashed by a bank). Congress has provided some guidance by defining a "socially and economically disad- vantaged small business concern" in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. ? 637(a)(4)-(5) (Supp. V 1981) and a "minority business enterprise" in the Public Works Employment Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. ? 6705(f)(2) (Supp. V 1981). For a discussion of these provisions see infra text accompanying notes 133-37. Of course, in the context of civil rights litigation a court need not restrict itself to these definitions of minority enterprises.</page><page sequence="4">1156 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 69:1153 officers, employees, or business associates. Second, courts could permit a corporate civil rights claimant to assert its right of free association when- ever discriminatory actions obstruct its attempts to do business with mi- nority groups. Finally, corporations could attain standing in the same way natural persons do: as creatures with racial character who have suffered discrimination because of that character. This choice of doctrinal tools affects both the scope and clarity of the standing rule. The Supreme Court has often stated that absent exceptional circum- stances, a party is denied standing to assert the rights of third persons." Exceptional circumstances occur more often than one might suppose, however, for the Court has frequently approved third-party standing over the past thirty years, especially in the discrimination context.1" In Bar- rows v. Jackson,16 the Court permitted a white homeowner to assert the civil rights of a black purchaser as a defense against a suit by another owner seeking to enforce a restrictive covenant prohibiting sales to blacks. Although Barrows initially may have applied only to defendants, recent federal decisions indicate that white plaintiffs may recover for harms suffered from discrimination aimed at blacks.17 Like white individ- uals, corporations may sustain injury at the hands of persons or organiza- tions who seek to harm blacks. Accordingly, at least one court has explic- itly granted third-party standing to corporations alleging race discrimination.1 Third-party standing as a solution to corporate standing difficulties has two problems, however: it is entirely discretionary with the courts, and it rests on third-party rights that may not always exist among corporate shareholders. Despite the list of cases ignoring the "rule" against third- party standing,19 courts always are free to deny standing to assert an- 14 See, e.g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975); Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1974) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 443-46 (1972); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.

"I See supra note 15.</page><page sequence="5">1983] Corporate Standing 1157 other's rights.20 The Supreme Court has on occasion overruled discretion- ary standing where lower courts found reason to grant it.2' Even if denials of standing are rare, a discretionary third-party standing doctrine pro- vides an escape for courts seeking to avoid troublesome substantive is- sues. Accordingly, corporate claimants will not always be able to invoke third-party rights, and discrimination against minority-owned businesses will sometimes escape punishment. Further, a corporation's race discrimination claim may be misstated if framed in terms of third-party standing. Generally, injury to a corpora- tion is not legally cognizable as injury to its individual shareholders.22 Courts have uniformly applied this rule to civil rights claims.23 Standing to assert third parties' rights presumes the existence of legal rights in those third parties. Thus, when corporations sustain injury because of their shareholders' race, courts might well refuse to allow third-party standing on grounds that the shareholders have no legal right to be free from discriminatory harms to the corporation they own. Corporate rights of free association are also a flawed foundation for race discrimination claims. The Supreme Court has approved the stand- ing of a corporation to assert its own associational rights as well as those of its shareholders.24 Yet an associational rights approach will not always be effective when corporations suffer race discrimination. Not all injuries to corporations due to racial animus cause associational harms. Bigots in the business world may target "black" companies for hostile treatment without aiming at any officers or shareholders in particular, not because those companies do business with blacks or support black political causes, but because in the eye of the discriminator they possess black racial char- acter." Corporations so harmed are deterred, not from doing business with blacks, but from doing business at all. This type of harm may not affect associational rights. Because discrimination is aimed at the corpo- ration only, its ability to associate with others is unaffected.26 The only 10 See supra note 8 and accompanying text. 21 E.g., McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 429-30 (1961). " Green v. Victor Talking Mach. Co., 24 F.2d 378, 382 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 278 U.S. 602 (1928). See also N. Lattin, The Law of Corporations ? 11 (2d ed. 1971) (except in rare instances, harm to a corporation gives rise only to a suit by the corporation or to a share- holder's derivative suit); Annot., 167 A.L.R. 279 (1947) (discussing the rule and its exceptions). " See supra note 10. 24 In NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963), the Court stated: "We think petitioner may assert this right on its own behalf, because, though a corporation, it is directly engaged in those activities, claimed to be constitutionally protected, which the [challenged] statute would curtail."

But these rights also may be unaffected by race discrimination aimed at businesses. Sharehold- ers who joined together for purely economic and not political reasons have probably not engaged in any communicative activity, a necessary predicate to asserting associational rights.27 The better approach in these cases is to focus solely on the injury to the corporation rather than on any violation of its constituents' rights. The argument that corporations can possess racial identities focuses on the corporation's injury. Like the third-party approach, it looks at the connection between the corporation and third parties, but its approach is to ask whether that connection is strong enough to shape the corpora- tion's identity, at least in the eyes of those who discriminate. Like associ- ational rights standing, recognizing race in corporate bodies protects those who incorporate to advance minority group interests through politi- cal action. Standing based on racial identity goes further, however, be- cause it also protects those who seek only to compete in the business world on an equal footing. B. The Arlington Heights Decision The United States Supreme Court has only once directly addressed the question of whether a corporation has standing to allege race discrimina- tion.28 In Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop- 27 As mentioned supra note 5, the right of association is a first amendment right. E.g., Marchioro v. Chaney, 442 U.S. 191 (1979); United Mine Workers v. Illinois State Bar Ass'n, 389 U.S. 217 (1967); Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Virginia, 377 U.S. 1 (1964); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449 (1958). Because this right derives from the first amendment, communication of some sort is essen- tial to its assertion. Cf. Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Virginia, 377 U.S. 1, 8 (1964) (litigation for nonpolitical purposes is sufficient communication to trigger first amendment protection). And although the Supreme Court has granted limited first amendment protec- tion to "the free flow of commercial information," Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Vir- ginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 764 (1976), the Court has never indi- cated that the first amendment protects commercial conduct as well as commercial speech. Cf. Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557 (1980) (promo- tional advertising by electrical utility protected); Linmark Assocs. v. Township of Wil- lingboro, 431 U.S. 85 (1977) (real estate "For Sale" signs protected); Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748 (1976) (price advertis- ing of pharmaceutical drugs protected). 28 Justice Black raised the question of corporate racial identity for polemical purposes in dissent in Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 303 U.S. 77, 83 (1938) (Black, J., dis- senting). In that case Justice Black sought to refute the proposition that the word "person" in the fourteenth amendment includes corporations by citing Justice Swayne's dissent in the Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1873) (Swayne, J., dissenting). Justice Swayne argued that "by 'any person' [in the language of the fourteenth amendment] was</page><page sequence="7">19831 Corporate Standing 1159 ment Corp.,2 the Court, in a single sentence of dictum, rejected the no- tion that a corporation could be the direct target of race discrimination. It did not decide whether a corporation had standing to assert the rights of third persons in a race discrimination suit.30 In Arlington Heights, a nonprofit development corporation (MHDC) sought to build racially integrated low and moderate income housing in a Chicago suburb. Together with individual plaintiffs, MHDC challenged as racially discriminatory the suburb's refusal to rezone for multi-family units."' The district court assumed that MHDC had standing, but dis- missed the complaint for failure to show intent to discriminate.32 The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ignored the standing issue and reversed on the fourteenth amendment equal protec- tion claim."" On appeal, the Supreme Court addressed the standing issue. The Court said that the corporate plaintiff had met constitutional34 standing re- quirements by showing that it had suffered an injury "'likely to be re- dressed by a favorable decision.""' Turning to prudential limitations on standing, the Court said that MHDC could assert its "right to be free of arbitrary or irrational zoning actions."3 The Court noted, however, that a race discrimination claim lay at the heart of the litigation. Addressing that claim, Justice Powell declared that "[a]s a corporation, MHDC has no racial identity and cannot be the direct target of the petitioners' al- leged discrimination."37 With that single line, the Court raised and dis- missed the possibility that a corporation might have a racial character which could support a race discrimination claim brought in the corpora- tion's own right. The Court was able to rule against MHDC's standing to bring a race discrimination claim without having to dismiss the lawsuit, because it meant all persons within the jurisdiction of the State. No distinction is intimated on ac- count of race or color." Id. at 128-29 (emphasis in original). Justice Black added, "Corpora- tions have neither race nor color." Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. v.

Because an individual plaintiff had standing to pursue the civil rights claim, the Court did not decide whether MHDC had standing to assert third-party rights.39 C. Subsequent Federal Court Decisions Since the Arlington Heights decision, a number of corporations have brought race discrimination claims. One district court, relying on Justice Powell's dictum, dismissed a complaint for lack of standing,40 but other courts have allowed claims to proceed despite Arlington Heights." In Des Vergnes v. Seekonk Water District,42 the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit followed the Arlington Heights dictum, but granted a corporate plaintiff third-party standing to litigate its race discrimina- tion claim.43 Two years later, the same court acknowledged the possibility of corporate racial identity by making proof that the firm is minority- owned the initial element of a discriminatory intent argument." Another federal court admitted its uneasiness about allowing a corporation to bring a race discrimination claim.45 The court decided, however, that a close corporation wholly owned by blacks could bring a claim as a "'black' corporation" under 42 U.S.C. ? 1981.46 Aside from the First Circuit's brief treatment, only a Second Circuit S3 Id. at 264. 39 Id. at 263-64. 40 Hudson Valley Freedom Theatre, Inc. v.

"48 HVFT's claim alleged that defendants, Orange County and various county officials charged with administering the local CETA program,49 had denied its application for CETA funds and had delayed or terminated previously approved CETA programs.60 HVFT asserted that the defendants acted with racially discriminatory intent in violation of HVFT's constitutionally and statutorily protected rights.5' In its com- plaint, HVFT stated that it brought suit in its own right and not on be- half of third parties.92 The district court, ruling that "a corporation, as a faceless creature of the state, may not assert claims of racial discrimina- tion under the Fourteenth Amendment on its own behalf, and cannot be the 'target' of racial discrimination," dismissed the civil rights claim.53 On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed the dismissal of the equal pro- tection and Title VI"4 claims."" Judge Friendly's majority opinion first reasoned that Title VI's language did not limit its relief to persons who had suffered discrimination because of their own race, color, or national origin, so long as the discrimination suffered was based on someone's race, color, or national origin. 6 The court did not rest its decision on this 47 671 F.2d 702 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 103 S.

In holding Arlington Heights inapplicable where a corpora- tion's purposes or the character of its shareholders prompts discrimina- tion resulting in corporate injury, the court did not specify whether the corporation derives a racial identity from its purpose or shareholders or whether, though remaining racially neutral, it is somehow able to rest its claim on its shareholders or the people it serves. In support of its holding, the court cited the Supreme Court's willingness in Fullilove v. Klutz- nick" to entertain the equal protection claim of white-owned construc- tion firms challenging a ten percent set-aside for "minority business en- terprises" mandated by the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.69 Judge Friendly interpreted the Court's willingness to hear the claim with- out discussing standing problems as tacit support for the proposition that a corporation may bring an equal protection claim when it suffers harm due to race discrimination aimed at its shareholders.60 As additional au- thority for its holding, the court cited T &amp; S Service Associates v. Cren- son,61 which held that a corporation did have standing to bring a claim under 42 U.S.C. ? 198162 alleging race discrimination in the award of con- tracts, but that a black 100% shareholder did not. Judge Friendly remarked on the hardship that would result if a corpo- ration were denied standing because it lacked race, while a shareholder's claim was also barred because the corporation had sustained the injury.68 Noting that the prudential limitations on standing are intended to ensure "that the most effective advocate of the rights at issue is present to Amendment, whereas here the plaintiff seeks relief also on the basis of 42 U.S.C. ? 2000d, which says that "No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

The court did not comment on its decision to reverse the dismissals of the equal protec- tion clause and Title VI claims only. Although its treatment of Title VI was peculiar to that section of the Code, it is unclear whether it believed that its second rationale is inapplicable to sections 1981, 1983," and 198567 and to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. Corporate standing to allege race discrimination thus remains a hope- less muddle. Some courts have simply ignored Arlington Heights.,8 The Second Circuit, by distinguishing it from Hudson Valley Freedom Thea- ter, has invited new corporate civil rights claims. Moreover, by suggesting that HVFT and minority corporations do have racial identity, the Second Circuit has impliedly criticized the Arlington Heights dictum and limited its application. Just what Judge Friendly would replace Arlington Heights with, however, remains unclear. The Second Circuit essentially adopted a statutory interpretation which mandates third-party standing. Yet that interpretation covers some civil rights provisions but not others, so that whether discrimination against black businesses is to be deterred may depend on whether those businesses' lawyers can fit their claims into the "right" statutes. II. CONGRESSIONAL INTENT AND THE STANDING QUESTION If the protections of the fifth and fourteenth amendments and the Civil Rights Acts were by their terms unavailable to corporations, the question of corporate capacity to have racial character would be unimportant. The doctrine that the law confers rights on corporations as well as on natural persons is, however, an old one, and the constitutional status of corpora- tions has evolved to the point where corporations have some, but not all, constitutional rights.9 Accordingly, the United States Supreme Court has 64 Id. (quoting Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 80 (1978)). 6 671 F.2d at 706-07. 66 42 U.S.C. ? 1983 (1976). 67 42 U.S.C. ? 1985 (1976). 68 See, e.g., T &amp; S Serv.

Secretary of Defense, 61 B.U.L. Rev. 1271 (1981). The earliest Supreme Court cases adjudicating the constitutional status of corporations antedated the development of the modern economy in the United States and the wide- spread adoption of general incorporation laws, as well as the ripening of an ideology of cor- porate legal personality, which accompanied these economic changes. G. Henderson, supra, at 37. See also Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 61, 86 (1809) (hold- ing corporations not citizens for purpose of diversity jurisdiction). 70 Unlike the privileges and immunities clauses of article IV and the fourteenth amend- ment, the constitutional guarantees of due process and of equal protection of the laws, as well as most civil rights legislation, speak in terms of the rights of "persons," not "citizens." The "conspiracy theory" of the fourteenth amendment makes much of this choice of words. Relying heavily upon oral argument by Roscoe Conkling (a former member of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the fourteenth amendment) in San Mateo County v. Southern Pac. R.R., 116 U.S. 138 (1885), proponents of the theory argue that the amendment was drafted deliberately to extend substantive rights to corporations. See, e.g., 2 C. Beard &amp; M. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization 111-13 (1930). The conspiracy theory is now widely discredited. See Boudin, Truth and Fiction about the Fourteenth Amendment, 16 N.Y.U.L.Q. Rev. 19 (1938); Graham, The "Conspiracy Theory" of the Four- teenth Amendment, 47 Yale L.J. 371 (1938) [hereinafter cited as Graham, Conspiracy The- ory 1], Graham, The "Conspiracy Theory" of the Fourteenth Amendment: 2, 48 Yale L.J. 171 (1938) [hereinafter cited as Graham, Conspiracy Theory 2]; McLaughlin, The Court, The Corporation, and Conkling, 46 Am. Hist. Rev. 45 (1940). Although there is no convinc- ing evidence that the framers of the Reconstruction amendments and the Civil Rights Acts deliberately worded them in such a way as to include corporate rights in the Constitution and statutes, they doubtless did understand the word "person" to include corporations. Al- most thirty years before Reconstruction, when the Taney Court announced that corpora- tions are not article IV citizens, it also said that they are, for some purposes, legal persons. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, 587-88 (1839). See also Graham, Conspiracy Theory 2, supra, at 194 ("It is now plain that corporate personality, as a constitutional doc- trine, antedated the Fourteenth Amendment...."). On February 15, 1871, Representative John Bingham introduced H.R. 349 "extending to [life insurance] corporations the privi- leges and immunities guarantied by the Constitution to the citizens of the respective States." Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess. 1288 (1871), reprinted in The Reconstruction Amendments' Debates 481 (A. Avins ed. 1967). Arguing for adoption of the bill, Representa- tive Ben Butler of Massachusetts explained that the bill's premise was that the privileges and immunities clause applied to corporations, but that constitutional rights were unen- forceable unless a statute provided for their enforcement. Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess. 1289 (1871). The bill, and its proponents' arguments, said nothing of due process and equal protection, perhaps because its proponents assumed that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 had already made the rights encompassed by those phrases enforceable. A bill enacted in February 1871 provided that in all subsequent legislation the word "per- son should extend to "bodies politic and corporate" except where context indicates a nar- rower construction was intended.

More recently, the Supreme Court has said that "by 1871, it was well understood that corporations should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis."

Deveaux, 9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 61, 86 (1809). In that case, Chief Justice Marshall addressed the question whether a corporation chartered in one state could sue or be sued in a federal court of another state under diver- sity jurisdiction. Marshall wrote: "That invisible, intangible, and artificial being, that mere legal entity, a corporation aggregate, is certainly not a citizen; and, consequently, cannot sue or be sued in the courts of the United States, unless the rights of the members, in this respect, can be exercised in their corporate name." Id. Since Deveaux, the Court and Con- gress have wrestled with the question of corporate citizenship for diversity purposes. See Navarro Sav. Ass'n v. Lee, 446 U.S. 458, 461 n.7 (1980); G.

The fourteenth amendment and Reconstruction era Civil Rights Acts sometimes spoke in terms of "persons" and sometimes in terms of "citi- zens," and much has turned on the distinction.7 Although congressional Republicans undoubtedly understood the implication of their semantic choices, it was the plight of individuals, not of corporations, that underlay their actions." Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and framed the fourteenth amendment's first section in response to enactment of the Black Codes78 in several southern states. In the face of the Codes, the Civil Rights Acts were intended to put beyond question the freedmen's citizenship and to ensure them equality before the law.79 To resolve doubts about Congress' constitutional authority to enact the 1866 Act, the framers of the fourteenth amendment largely incorporated the Act into the amendment's first section.80 Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (Ku Klux Klan Act), now present day sections 1983 and 1985, in response to continued depredation of the freedmen's rights.8" Quite naturally, therefore, the congressional debates focus on the freed- men's rights and give no inkling that the rights of black corporations were considered by Congress. None of the debates suggest that anyone antici- pated that black-owned corporations would be among the beneficiaries of the fourteenth amendment and Civil Rights Acts because the idea of black-owned and black-managed businesses would have been fantastic to 70 1 C.

Given the setting of the debates and the racial at- titudes of even some of the strongest supporters of the freedmen's rights, any different reaction would have been surprising. Unlike the Reconstruction Congresses, the Congress which passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did address, briefly, the rights of minority-owned businesses. The bill ultimately enacted was the House version of the bill as amended in the Senate.63 The Senate Committee on Commerce re- ported out an earlier version of the Act, S. 1732,84 which roughly corre- sponded to Title II of the Act dealing with places of public accommoda- tion. Section 3(a) of S. 1732 guaranteed "the full and equal enjoyment" of covered establishments to "[aill persons.""' In its section-by-section anal- ysis of the bill, the committee report stated: "Person," as that term is used in subsection 3(a) and other sec- tions of the bill, may include other than natural persons, as in the case where a business entity is refused the right to purchase, use, rent, or hire goods, services, or facilities on account of the race, color, religion, or national origin of its owner or operator.8 The Senate Commerce Committee's definition of "person" is a significant acknowledgment of corporate racial character, but it applied to an early version of the Act and stands as a few lines amidst millions of words of debate. Yet, as with Reconstruction legislation, congressional silence with respect to corporate victims of racial bias is unsurprising. Much of the debate on Title II centered on the insult and humiliation suffered by those turned away from public accommodations on account of race.88 The Senate Committee Report described S. 1732's primary purpose as com- I' Graham, Conspiracy Theory 1, supra note 70, at 386 n.50 ("[Olne searches the debates in Congress and in the ratifying legislatures in vain for any intimation to the effect that the Fourteenth Amendment afforded prospective relief to corporations."). Most radicals, sub- scribing to a laissez-faire philosophy of self-help, were unwilling to take any legislative steps beyond providing the freedmen equality before the law. Many, believing the freedmen una- ble to compete, assumed that they would find their place near the bottom of society. See G. Fredrickson, The Black Image in the White Mind 178-86 (1871).

Loss of dignity and in- sult are personal experiences that seem inapplicable to corporations. That there is but a single reference to discrimination against black businesses in the vast legislative history of the various Civil Rights Acts is unsurprising. This dearth of comment reveals that Congress understood race discrimination in terms of personal harms. Although passing refer- ence in the Senate Report to discrimination against corporations points to recognition of corporate racial character, the legislative history gener- ally shows that claims by minority-owned corporations were neither ex- plicitly included nor precluded. The issue was simply not decided. It does not follow that corporations should have no claim alleging race discrimination. Courts have read the amendment and the Acts expan- sively to permit claims unanticipated by, and sometimes contrary to the intent of, their framers.90 In 1873 Justice Miller wrote that the fourteenth amendment's equal protection clause was "so clearly a provision for [blacks]" that it would probably never be applied in favor of any non- black claimant.91 A mere thirteen years later, the Supreme Court read the fourteenth amendment to protect corporations without regard to their ra- cial composition.92 Courts have also been expansive in their treatment of the Civil Rights Acts, holding that sections 1981 and 1983 should be liberally construed." As noted above, corporations may bring a section 1981 claim.94 Courts 89 S. Rep. No. 872, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. pt. 1, at 16, reprinted in 1964 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.

Bickel, The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 56-59 (1955). Nevertheless, he concludes that Brown was properly decided, because the amend- ment must be treated as organic and responsive to the "moral and material state" of each era. Id. at 59-65.

Interpreting the meaning of "person aggrieved" in the Civil Rights Act of 1968,100 the Supreme Court held those words to allow standing as broad as that permitted by article III of the Constitution."'0 Other courts have also said that standing in civil rights actions should be as broadly construed as article III permits.102 None of these cases attribute race to corporate bodies. All of them, however, urge a sweeping approach to standing under the Civil Rights Acts in order to strike effectively at forbidden discrimination. Similarly, congressional silence as to the racial status of corporations provides no direct support for extending standing to those entities on the same terms as to natural persons. Still, silence is as consistent with acknowledging corporate racial character as with the Arlington Heights dictum. Congress and the courts have authored a body of law aimed at curbing discrimina- tion affecting individuals. One therefore looks in vain for clear guidance on issues involving corporate harm. Nevertheless, lawmakers' strong feel- ing against discrimination itself suggests that courts should expand standing as the need becomes apparent. III. ASCRIBING PERSONAL TRAITS TO CORPORATIONS Commentators long ago pointed out that nineteenth century juris- prudes had misdescribed corporations when they called them "fictitious" or "artificial" beings.103 The description failed, first, by casting real and powerful institutions as mere creatures of the law. Early twentieth-cen- tury legal scholars, the images of the Robber Barons and the great trusts fresh in their memories, could not comfortably adopt a theory of the cor- poration that relegated it to a shadow world of legal fictions instead of 95 League of United Latin Am.

As a result, the law of corporations has created a set of legal rules that operate upon the assumption of reification.108 Of course, at times the law recognizes reification as a simplifying device that may distort real relationships and work an injustice. The alter-ego doc- trine, or "piercing the corporate veil" is perhaps the clearest instance where courts insist on penetrating the corporate form to reach the corpo- ration's constituents.'09 When piercing the corporate veil, courts look behind the corporate en- tity and determine the rights and liabilities of the individual constituents according to their own acts and omissions. But even when courts treat a corporation as a separate entity, they may scrutinize the corporation's constituents closely to determine its legal status. Not surprisingly, reifica- tion often leads to very "human" characterizations of the corporation. Corporations are said to enter into contracts as if they were capable of assent and to make corporate charitable contributions as if they could feel charitable sentiment. In these cases, the source of the corporation's imputed human characteristics causes no concern. Sometimes, however, the human traits or capacities attributed to a corporation clearly belong to its shareholders, its agents, or both. Indeed, the source of these attrib- utes often becomes a critical legal question.110 104 See, e.g., Machen, Corporate Personality, 24 Harv. L. Rev. 253 (1911). 105 For a discussion of reification of the corporation, see W.

When the veil is pierced, it disappears-the separate entity is wholly disregarded. When the veil is not pierced, the law still recognizes the corporation as a separate entity, but one which often draws upon some or all of its constituents in adopt- ing any particular trait. The rights or liabilities of the constituents are separate from the corporation's, and constituent and corporation may face different legal treatment. Occasionally, for example, courts have held corporations criminally liable for their agents' misdeeds while acquitting their agents.1"' A number of the traits which courts ascribe to corporations carry a uniquely human character. Intent is a state of mind, hence seemingly be- yond the capacity of an impersonal economic entity. Nationality is partly inherited, partly adopted as cultural heritage, but in any event a wholly personal, individual characteristic. Both intent and nationality thus re- semble race, which is itself arguably part state of mind, part physical in- heritance. Following is a brief exposition of the judicial treatment of cor- porate intent and nationality and the statutory treatment of corporate racial identity. Then, the granting and limitation of selected constitu- tional rights to corporations is briefly explored. This preliminary look yields no clear rules for deciding when to assign personal character to corporate bodies, but it does present several contexts in which the law views corporations in human terms. The analysis then returns to the problem of ascribing race to corporations in civil rights actions. A. Ascription in Three Contexts 1. Criminal Intent Originally, the canon law provided for punishment of corporate misbe- havior by excommunication, but in the thirteenth century Pope Innocent IV ended the practice, saying that a corporation could not suffer excom- munication because it had no soul to lose.112 Presumably for similar rea- sons, an old maxim taught, "societas delinquere non potest" (a corpora- tion can do no wrong).1" Lord Holt stated the eighteenth-century English 345 (H.L.), discussed infra note 131 and accompanying text, was the question of whose at- tributes to impute: those of a single officer or those of the remaining directors and shareholders. "I See, e.g., American Med. Ass'n v. United States, 130 F.2d 233, 253 (D.C. Cir. 1942), aff'd, 317 U.S. 519 (1943); United States v.

"114 Several conceptual obstacles stood in the way of corporate criminal lia- bility. Most stemmed from a reluctance to impute human motivations or physical power to an entity which lacked body, soul, and mind. Because corporations possessed neither soul nor mind, they were thought incapa- ble of having mens rea. Having no bodies, they could not commit such crimes as battery or manslaughter whose elements included physical acts. They could not be indicted, as they could not plead in person, or pun- ished, as there was no physical person to punish. Finally, they were pro- tected from liability by the doctrine of ultra vires, because any criminal act was by definition outside the legitimate purposes for which they were chartered.-" For most courts, attributing mens rea to corporations was the hardest of these conceptual problems. Throughout most of the nineteenth cen- tury, American courts balked at imposing criminal liability on corpora- tions for specific intent crimes.1" In an oft-cited opinion, the New Jersey Supreme Court stated that "a corporation cannot, in the nature of things, ... be liable for any crime of which a corrupt intent or malus animus is an essential ingredient."'117 Towards the end of the nineteenth century, American jurisdictions gradually began to hold corporations liable for specific intent crimes.1"' on Corporate Criminal Liability, 19 U.

Contrary to Lord Holt's statement of English law, eighteenth-century English courts would hold corporations criminally liable for nuisance. The courts drew a distinction, however, between such acts of "nonfeasance" and acts of "misfeasance" for which, following the doctrine of ultra vires, the corporation could not be held liable. Elkins, Corporations and the Criminal Law: An Uneasy Alliance, 65 Ky. L.J. 73, 86-87 (1976). Early American deci- sions applied this same rule. See State v. Ohio &amp; M.R.R., 23 Ind. 362 (1864); State v. Great Works Milling &amp; Mfg. Co., 20 Me. 41 (1841). The English courts extended corporate crimi- nal liability to acts of misfeasance in 1842 in The Queen v. Great N. of Eng. Ry., 9 Q.B. 315, 115 Eng.

In a case holding a corporation guilty of conspiracy, one court said: It seems to me as easy and logical to ascribe to a corporation an evil mind as it is to impute to it a sense of contractual obligation. There is an obvious physical difficulty in rendering a corporation amenable to corporal punishment, but there is no more intellectual difficulty in considering it capable of homicide or larceny than in thinking of it as devising a plan to obtain usurious interest.121 The Supreme Court later formally approved the notion of assigning corporations criminal intent. In one case, the Court held that when a cor- poration's agents act with the authority conferred on them, their acts and intent can be imputed to the corporation for purposes of assessing crimi- nal liability.122 The modern view that corporations can be guilty of most crimes comports with the Court's holding. Most commentators accept that mens rea can be attributed to the corporation; much of the remain- ing debate has centered on whose mens rea can be attributed, the acts for which it is attributed, and the defenses available to the corporation.123 2. Alien Status American law has long recognized the possibility that corporations can be enemy aliens.124 American decisions arising out of World War I based findings of alien status on place of incorporation, as one might determine a natural person's home country solely from his place of birth.12 These decisions treated corporations as wholly separate from the natural per- sons who own and work for them, because the corporation's official home, 9 United States v.

''29 In other circumstances, the Second Circuit has refused to allow place of incorporation to determine a corporation's nationality, when the vast majority of its shareholders were not nationals of the chartering nation.130 Since World War I, British law has paralleled the current American approach, holding that even a corporation chartered in the United King- dom may acquire enemy status, depending on the nationality or enemy character of its agents or of those who control it. This "control test" fo- cuses on directors and officers, but the nationality of shareholders may be material in determining the character of the controlling group.'3' The Versailles Treaty also focused on the nationality of those who controlled the corporation.

Racial Identity Outside the contexts of standing and the Civil Rights Acts, some fed- eral statutes have directly addressed the racial character of corporations.

The statute defines "minority business enterprise" as a business at least 50 per centum of which is owned by minority group members or, in case of a publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of the stock of which is owned by minority group mem- bers. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, minority group members are citizens of the United States who are Negroes, Span- ish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.136 These acts legally impute shareholders' race to corporations. One might more accurately say, however, that these acts recognize that others im- pute racial identity to corporations in the everyday world. Proponents of the amendment to the Public Works Employment Act argued that it was necessary to end an historical pattern of discrimination against minority- owned firms in the awarding of public contracts. This history and the evidence that proponents cited in support of the provision demonstrate that statutory imputation of racial identity was merely an effort to catch up with the everyday perception of these firms. Although the fifty per- cent minority ownership threshold was positive law, the racial identity of these firms predated enactment of the amendment. Proponents spoke of "minority businesses" as entities with real racial identities that needed the aid of the amendment, not as firms whose racial characters were the creation of legislative fiat.137 B.

The Constitution speaks of rights which are by nature personal. The first amendment protects rights of self-expression. Guarantees against forced self-incrimination and unreasonable searches and seizures are often understood to protect privacy rights of those subject to criminal investigation.140 The capacity for self-expression and the desire for pri- vacy are indisputably human. Although these characteristics may seem more abstract than intent or race, they nevertheless represent human in- dividuality in a broad sense. The Supreme Court has taken three strikingly different approaches in deciding whether the protection of personal rights provided by the first, fourth, and fifth amendments should be extended to corporations. In First National Bank v. Bellotti,141 the Court held that the first amend- ment protects corporate speech without regard to the identity of the speaker.142 Corporations thus receive the benefits of first amendment cov- erage solely because they engage in protected activity and not because of any human characteristics they might exhibit. In contrast, the Court has held that the fourth amendment protects corporations because a "corpo- ration is, after all, but an association of individuals under an assumed name and with a distinct legal entity.'143 It is precisely the fact that the only indirectly from the legally cognizable interests subsumed under the corporate form."

Finally, the Court has denied corporations the fifth amendment privilege against forced self- incrimination on the theory that a corporation is inherently incapable of maintaining a "'private enclave where [it] may lead a private life.' "144 Thus, without an explicit rationale, the Court attributes human charac- teristics to corporations in granting them certain rights and invokes cor- porate impersonality in denying them others. C. Ascription of Racial Character to Corporations One recurring theme in cases attributing personal characteristics to cor- porations is the representative role of the corporation. Courts have noted that individuals form corporations to pursue their business purposes. As an aggregate of individuals, the corporation is also an aggregate of those individuals' rights or characteristics. Where courts have ascribed owners' or officers' rights to corporations, they have often done so on the premise that corporations assert those rights in a representative capacity. Thus, courts have been solicitous of the right of shareholders not to be harassed by repeated prosecutions of their corporation for the same offense.145 144 Bellis v. United States, 417 U.S. 85, 91 (1974) (quoting Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U.S. 52, 55 (1964)). In United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694 (1944), the Court stated: The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is essentially a personal one, applying only to natural individuals. It grows out of the high sentiment and regard of our jurisprudence for conducting criminal trials and investigatory proceedings upon a plane of dignity, humanity and impartiality. It is designed to prevent the use of legal process to force from the lips of the accused individual the evidence necessary to convict him or to force him to produce and authenticate any personal documents or effects that might incriminate him. Physical torture and other less violent but equally reprehensible modes of compelling the production of incriminating evidence are thereby avoided. Id. at 698. Both Bellis (partnerships) and White (unincorporated labor union) involved noncorporate collective organizations. White, however, followed an earlier Supreme Court decision, Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 74-75 (1906), which held that the fifth amendment privilege does not extend to corporations, and Bellis followed White. The fifth amendment protection against double jeopardy, however, does extend to corporations. See infra note 145 and accompanying text. 145 On a number of occasions, courts have held that the fifth amendment's double jeop- ardy clause extends to corporations. United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564 (1977) (assumed without discussion); Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141 (1962) (per curiam); United States v. Security Nat'l Bank, 546 F.2d 492, 494 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 950 (1977). The language of the clause, which speaks of "jeopardy of life or limb," would seem to preclude extension of the protection to unnatural persons. But relying on cases that have chosen in other contexts not to read "life or limb" literally, courts have chosen not to deny the clause's applicability to corporations. United States v. Security Nat'l Bank, 546 F.2d at 494-95. The Second Circuit has explained that the rationale for double</page><page sequence="26">1178 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 69:1153 Similarly, the Supreme Court has viewed the corporation's claim to fourth amendment protection as an expression of the pooled fourth amendment rights of the individual shareholders.1" Pursuing the logic of representation, courts should not assign individ- ual rights or characteristics to a corporation when the corporation does not assert them in a truly representative manner. The Supreme Court observed that a business organization's documents lacked an "essential element of confidentiality" and therefore differed from personal ones in ruling that a partnership had no fifth amendment privilege.147 In effect, the Court said that because a business organization cannot treat its docu- ments in the manner that a shareholder would treat his own, it cannot be exercising its shareholders' constitutional privilege in a representative ca- pacity. One might well wonder whether a corporation "taking the fifth" might inevitably avoid incriminating some corporate members or officers to the possible detriment of others. Unless criminal guilt permeated the whole business, assertion of the privilege would represent only a part-and hardly the most worthy part-of the corporation. Protecting fourth amendment interests, on the other hand, protects all corporate members who want privacy, not merely all who fear criminal prosecution. Ascribing personal traits to corporations may also benefit those who are not the corporation's constituents. Underlying the Court's decisions to protect corporations against unreasonable searches and seizures and double jeopardy may be a belief that permitting these practices with cor- porate defendants would infect police and prosecutorial practices when dealing with individuals.148 Congress imputes "minority" character to "minority business enterprises" to help disadvantaged segments of soci- ety because those enterprises embody the interests of their minority own- ers. Judges and juries assign corporations intent at least partly to ensure effective state oversight and regulation of criminal business activities. The law treats some businesses as aliens to prevent subversion during wartime. The public policy or regulatory rationale for ascription often as- sumes that corporations represent their constituents. Courts impute in- tent to corporations for criminal acts because they assume that the corpo- rate action represents the evil purposes of those who manipulate the corporate actor. Similarly, the state designates certain corporations alien jeopardy protection to corporations is protection of the individual entrepreneurs and share- holders who comprise the corporation. Id. 146 See supra note 143 and accompanying text. 147 See supra note 144 and accompanying text. As described above, the Court has held similarly in the context of a corporate defendant. Id. 148 See also First Nat'l Bank v.

Another theme runs through the various ways the law assigns human character to corporations. As legal treatment sometimes reflects the way corporations embody their members' human characteristics, it may also reflect the way outsiders see corporations. If the rest of the world treats a business as if it had human motivation, nationality, or race, it may not matter that the corporation in fact possesses none of these qualities. Per- sonification of corporations may begin as an aid to expression or a con- venient shorthand, but eventually the anthropomorphic metaphors as- sume realistic proportions. The law appropriately recognizes these perceptions, for they inevitably influence social and economic behavior. Thus, when Congress defined "minority business enterprises," it merely recognized that many people impute racial character to corporations and adjust their behavior accordingly. Based on their perception of its race, people may actively seek to do business with a corporation or shun it completely. Corporations also may identify themselves with particular groups in order to achieve political goals or maximize profits. To the ex- tent society has an interest in protecting or deterring certain kinds of race-conscious action, public perceptions will be important independent of actual racial identity. So long as bigots discriminate against businesses managed or owned by blacks, other businesses will be less likely to hire black managers, and other black investors will find it more difficult to pool their capital. The point is not that imputing racial identity to a cor- poration is necessarily bad: society may wish to encourage businesses to publicize their minority ownership or management in order to provide role models for disadvantaged groups or generally to assist those groups' integration into the economic mainstream of society. The point is rather that popular perceptions of businesses as in some sense racial gives them racial character. Applying these themes, it is reasonable to ascribe racial character to corporations. Corporations may not necessarily seek to represent their constituents' racial identity, although some do, but often that representa- tive role is thrust upon them. Their shareholders' or directors' race may be a highly visible element of the corporation's image. The very premise of a corporation's claim alleging race discrimination is that at least one person, the defendant, has harmed the corporation because to him it rep- resented the race of its constituents or customers. Representativeness thus arises both from within and without the corporation-the result of both the character of the corporation's constituents and the perception of those outside the corporation. If a corporation therefore represents the racial characteristics of its in- dividual owners, operators, and customers, it should receive the protec- tion of the fourteenth amendment and the Civil Rights Acts. Broadly</page><page sequence="28">1180 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 69:1153 stated, the purpose of the amendment and Acts is to provide equal rights for all persons.149 In part, equal rights must mean an equal opportunity to take part in the national economy. Section 1981 recognizes as much by protecting the rights of "[a]ll persons . . . to make and enforce con- tracts."I'IO One way people exercise these rights in any modern economy is by participating in corporate organizations. Shareholders of course expect that the corporation will represent them in their entrepreneurial capacity, not as potential section 1981 claimants. Litigation is not usually the rep- resentative role for which people organize corporations.151 Where the cor- poration is closely identified with its constituents, however, and where the constituents could invoke the protection of the fourteenth amend- ment and the Civil Rights Acts if they were doing business in some other form of organization, the corporation becomes not merely an association of people doing business, but an association of people of the class pro- tected by the amendment and the Acts doing business. At that point, the corporation, as representative of its constituents, should be able to claim a right to be free of race discrimination. Moreover, the widespread popu- lar adoption of this anthropomorphic metaphor ascribing race to corpora- tions confirms the corporation's representative role in vindicating its con- stituents' aggregated civil rights claim. Permitting those who discriminate to escape punishment for their acts merely because the injury is done to a corporation, rather than to a partnership or sole proprietorship, or to the corporation's constituents as individuals, inadequately deters discrimina- tory behavior and undermines the goals of the amendments and Acts. Such arguments derived from legislative purpose would be inapplicable if statutory language proscribed the expanded meaning suggested. As noted above, civil rights statutes framed in terms of the rights of "citi- zens" do not accord protection to corporations.152 In other cases, however, Congress has not prohibited a broadened standing rule. Indeed, courts read the Acts and the fourteenth amendment as mandating liberal stand- ing rules.153 Of course, the mere fact that no one else is available to vindicate an 149 See Virginia v.

The corporation, as a collective entity, itself has rights-the rights of the members it rep- resents. Corporate standing based on race merely reflects reality. IV. CONCLUSION Confronted with corporate plaintiffs raising race discrimination claims, some courts have chosen to ignore the dictum in Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. 65 By allowing corporate plaintiffs to go forward with their claims, these courts wisely have permit- ted corporations who can unquestionably meet constitutional standing requirements to seek remedies for real harms. Justice Powell's dictum in Arlington Heights might have been correct in the most formal sense, but the perceptions of both those who promote and those who attack minor- ity-owned businesses belie his words. As members of a community which still speaks in terms of "WASP" and "Jewish" law firms, lawyers should not be surprised that people often perceive corporations, and other orga- nizations as well, as having racial identity and other personal characteris- tics. Those perceptions create racial identity where none physically exists, and that identity invites the discrimination that Congress has plainly sought to prohibit. The fourteenth amendment and the Civil Rights Acts primarily protect individual rights. Despite the broad concept of equal rights before law for all persons envisioned by the drafters of these provisions, individual rights will diminish if individuals are unprotected when they combine in a corporate form. In applying these provisions, therefore, courts must match the ingenuity of those who would deny equal rights to some. If corporations are the targets of discrimination because of their sharehold- ers or directors' race, they should have available to them the same reme- dies that those shareholders or directors would have as individuals. In- deed, in other circumstances the law already imputes constituents' rights or characteristics to corporations in order to further public policy or vin- dicate the constituents' rights. Abandoning the Arlington Heights dictum and allowing corporate claimants to bring race discrimination claims would serve both of those purposes. R.N.S. 154 Schlesinger v.
