<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ancient Cemeteries of the Chukchi Peninsula* S. A. ARUTIUNOV, M. G. LEVIN and D. A. SERGEEV The complex problem of the origin of the Eskimo is very closely linked with the broad problem of the time and locale of the formation of the economic- cultural type represented by the Arctic sea mammal hunters. A great deal still remains to be learned in this respect. Elucidation of these problems is ham- pered by our inadequate knowledge of the archae- ology of the Arctic regions of northeastern Asia and northwestern North America - especially the coasts of the Chukchi Peninsula (Chukotka). Among the studies that have been made in Chukotka one can cite the monograph by S. I. Rudenko (Rudenko 1961) giving the results of his 1945 archaeological recon- naissance along the coast of the Chukchi Peninsula; the work of N. N. Dikov in the interior (various papers in Zapiski Chukotskogo Kraevedcheskogo Muzeia, Vyp. 1, 1958, and vyp. 2, 1961);1 and re- ports by A. P. Okladnikov (Okladnikov 1953; Oklad- nikov and Nekrasov 1959) and a few others. But the ancient Eskimo cemeteries which have been discovered and investigated in recent years are outstanding among the archaeological sites of Chukotka. The Uelen cemetery, discovered in 1955 and already known through a number of preliminary reports, was excavated over the course of four field seasons (1957-1960) by the Chukotka section of the Northern Expedition of the Institute of Ethnography, Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (Certain por- tions of the cemetery were excavated independently by N. N. Dikov in 1956 and 1958; the materials re- covered are not included in the present report.) Our work at Uelen yielded a very large quantity of ma- terial which is presently undergoing study. Some of it has been made available in preliminary reports (Levin 1958, 1960; Levin and Sergeev I960; Sergeev 1959).2 It is the aim of this communication to sum Translated by Chester S. Chard from Kratkie Soobshcheniia Instituía Etnografii, Vyp. 38, pp. 57-69. Moscow, 1963. JSome of these have been summarized or trans- lated in Chard 1960a and Dikov 1963 - Ed. 2 Several of these will appear shortly in a vol- ume of archaeological papers in the series Anthro- pology of the North: Translations from Russian Sources, edited by Henry N. Michael and pub- up certain results, also of a preliminary nature, of the excavation of the Uelen cemetery, inasmuch as the work there has now been completed. Our expedition opened a total of 76 burials at this site, which was used over a long period of time - a fact which is evident both from the presence of superimposed burials and also from the typological differences in the associated artifacts. That part of the cemetery excavated in 1960 will serve as the clearest example of this (see Arutiunov and Sergeev 1961). However, an overwhelming majority of the burials can be assigned to one major period - that of the Old Bering Sea culture. The basic criterion for the classification and periodization of the ancient Eskimo cultures is, of course, the typology of structural features and decora- tive elements of the harpoon complex, especially of the toggle harpoon heads. Examples of the latter were recovered from 37 of the graves opened by our party, totalling 171 specimens in all. The most de- tailed classification of ancient Eskimo harpoon heads is that provided by Collins (Collins 1937). This classification, like any other, is conditional to a considerable extent; and as our material shows, it is also not sufficiently comprehensive. Nevertheless, an attempt to determine the distribution of some of his types among the harpoons from the Uelen cemetery has a certain interest. Let us consider the heads with an open socket for the foreshaft. In this series 27 specimens belong to type Ix, which is characterized by the presence of two line holes, one above and the other below the end of the socket; by a trifurcated symmetrical spur, two lashing slots for holding the foreshaft in the socket, and by the presence of side blades which are aligned in the same plane as the axis of the line holes. Thirteen specimens may be assigned to type Iy, which differs from the preceding only in the posi- tioning of the side blades at right angles to the plane of the line holes. Three specimens can be referred to type IIx, which is characterized by a single line hole and an lished by the University of Toronto Press for the Arctic Institute of North America. A summary of Levin and Sergeev 1960 will be found in Chard 1960b - Ed. 143</page><page sequence="2">144 asymmetrical trifurcated lateral spur, and also by the presence of two side blades which are aligned in the same plane with the line hole and by two lashing slots. Type Ily, which differs from IIx in the position of the side blades at right angles to the plane of the line hole, is not represented in our collection. Twenty-five harpoon heads are assignable to type IIIx, defined as having an irregular, asym- metrical spur, one line hole, and an end blade parallel with the line hole. Type Illy, in which the end blade is at right angles to the line hole, is not represented at Uelen. In the series with open sockets, such types as II(a)x, III(a)x, II(b)x and II(c)y - representing slight modifications of the corresponding main types noted above - comprise only one or two examples. Six heads with open sockets do not conform to any of the types in Collins1 classification. In Fig. 1, type Ix is represented by No. 2, type Iy by No. 3, type IIx by No. 8, type IIIx by Nos. 17 and 18, type II(a)x by No. 16, and type III(a)x by No. 19. Nos. 1,4,5,6 and 7 do not conform to the classification. In the series with closed socket, type IIIx is the most numerous (20 examples). This is char- acterized by a trifurcated symmetrical spur with the center prong longer than the other two, and an end blade parallel to the single line hole (Fig. 1, Nos. 10,11). Such types as IVy, Vx, V(a)x and Vy are represented by a few specimens each, the last being the most numerous (six) (Fig. 1, Nos. 12 and 20). These are rather similar types characterized by a single simple, straight spur, one line hole, and an end blade parallel to the latter (group x) or at right angles (group y). In a special category are five harpoon heads with open socket not represented in Collins1 clas- sification (e.g. Fig. 1, Nos. 14,15) and belonging to types characteristic of the Birnirk culture (Ford 1959: 75-79). The remaining heads (about 50 in number) can- not be classified with any assurance, either be- cause of their poor state of preservation or because they were placed in the grave in an unfinished con- dition (i.e. they are blanks for harpoon heads). The generally accepted periodization of the ancient Eskimo cultures as a rule includes the following stages: Old Bering Sea, Okvik, Birnirk, and Punuk. All of these cultures are represented in the materials from the Uelen cemetery. More than a third of the toggle harpoon heads recovered can be considered typical of the Old Bering Sea culture. It is not so simple to isolate those of the Okvik culture. In many cases (some 25 specimens) it is difficult to decide whether a given harpoon head should be classified as Old Bering Sea or Okvik. Roughly as many can with more or less con- Arctic Anthropology 2, 1 fidence be assigned to the Okvik culture. Seven heads can be classified as Birnirk, and approximately the same number of Punuk. Over 40 cannot be clas- sified in this fashion with any assurance due to poor preservation, incompletion or lack of decoration. In the majority of graves the inventory belongs to the Old Bering Sea type. Associated with this in- ventory characteristic of the Old Bering Sea culture were found objects which are considered typical of the Okvik culture. Such a combination is not sur- prising, since in any scheme of periodization these stages are regarded as contiguous, and a transition from one to the other is quite natural. The question is, which of these cultures - Old Bering Sea or Okvik - preceded the other. The view that Okvik is the older is widely held. Larsen and Rainey have taken this position (1948: 155). In Giddings1 survey (1960: 123), Okvik I is dated to the 5th- 3rd cen- turies B.C., Okvik II from the 3rd- 1st centuries B.C. to the 1st century A.D. In the last few years works based on determinations of the age of the ancient Eskimo cultures by the radiocarbon method have ap- peared. According to these data, the Okvik culture is dated to a later time in comparison with the Old Bering Sea culture: 3rd century A.D. for the Old Bering Sea culture and 5th century A.D. for Okvik (Rainey and Ralph 1959: 373). The accuracy of these data should not be overestimated; it is necessary to take into consideration possible serious discrepancies in the results of radiocarbon analysis, caused first of all by the condition of the specimens from dif- ferent sites. But on the whole, it seems very probable that the Old Bering Sea culture is older as compared with Okvik. Analysis of the materials from the Uelen cemetery points in this direction. However, we would like to emphasize that in our opinion there was a definite and rather protracted stage during which the Old Bering Sea and Okvik cultures co-existed. This is rather definitely attested by the presence in the same grave at Uelen of an inventory typical of either culture and even of objects combining the distinctive features of both styles of ornamentation. Unfortunately, the Okvik culture is still insuf- ficiently known. The materials from the Okvik site, excavated by Rainey more than 25 years ago, have never been adequately published. But nevertheless it is already clear that one can scarcely speak of a direct evolution of the Old Bering Sea culture from Okvik or, on the other hand, of the Okvik culture from Old Bering Sea. These cultures are close to one another, and it appears that in the present case we are dealing rather with local variants which existed among the separate groups of the ancient Eskimo population of the Bering Sea. As yet we cannot point to the centers where these local characteristics arose. However, it is very probable that in the area we have studied cultural influences, and especially artistic- stylistic ones, from both centers were interacting.</page><page sequence="3">Arutiunov, Levin, and Sergeev: Ancient Cemeteries 145 The presence in modern times of several dialects among the Eskimos of Chukotka attests that even in adjacent groups significant local differences could have existed here. On the other hand, under the conditions of life prevailing among the ancient Eskimos, who regularly carried out quite long jour- neys by sea, mutual intercourse between even very remote groups was not ruled out. In this way, in- dividual culture traits could have been diffused. During the analysis of the inventory of the in- dividual burials, another circumstance could not be overlooked. The Eskimos of Chukotka in recent times are known to have utilized Punuk harpoon heads which they found in the ruins of ancient set- tlements for whaling, removing the stone end blades from them and replacing these with iron blades (Arutiunov and Sergeev 1961). This could have also occurred in earlier times. Individual burials belonging to the Birnirk and Punuk cultures were discovered in the Uelen cem- etery. The question of their dating has not evoked any differences of opinion. The Bimirk culture fol- lows after the Old Bering Sea-Okvik stage, and the Punuk culture replaces Birnirk. The Birnirk stage is dated by radiocarbon to the 8th century A.D. and the Punuk to the 10th century. The graves at Uelen assigned to these late cultures are isolated ones; they look quite alien among the main mass of burials which are similar to one another and evi- dently represent a large clan cemetery. In certain areas of the site some burials were overlain by others. This made it possible to clarify the situation regarding the relative chronology of individual types and complexes in the inventories. An especially interesting area was excavated in 1960 (Arutiunov and Sergeev 1961). Here it was possible to work out the differences between the early and late variants of such categories of the inventory as harpoon heads and "winged objects". Of great significance was the discovery in 1959 of an engraving tool with an iron blade which is dated to a time no later than the middle of the first millennium A.D. (Levin and Sergeev 1960). This is the oldest find of iron in the Arctic. In the present paper we will not touch on the rich and distinctive art of the ancient Uelen people, which is represented to some extent in the previous preliminary reports. We will note only the general wealth of the inventory from Uelen - e.g. no less than 18 "winged objects" were found. In 1960, when Sergeev was excavating the last portions of the Uelen cemetery, word was received that human bones had been found at the abandoned settlement of Tunytlen on the right bank of the Eiliukeu River. There were also reports of finds of bones on the left bank of the river in the region of Cape Verbliuzh. An archaeological survey carried out in these areas by Sergeev in 1961 turned up a 19th century cemetery near Tunytlen and another of the same age two or three kilometers from the coast in the region of Cape Verbliuzh. But near the ruins of the old settlement of Ekven an ancient Eskimo burial place was discovered on two knolls 800 meters from the shore. The graves were located by the presence of whale bones and stones projecting above the surface. Fifteen graves were opened on the western knoll and three on the eastern. Work at the Ekven cemetery has only begun. Only after further excavations will it be possible to render any definitive assessment of this site. The eighteen graves opened yielded an inventory typical of the Old Bering Sea-Okvik stage. Comparatively few of the harpoon heads here have two line holes; the predominant types are IIIx and Illy. The objects from the Ekven cemetery resemble the main body of the inventory from Uelen. At the same time, major local distinctions are undoubtedly present. These distinctions are manifested in details of the manu- facture and decoration of the toggle harpoon heads, in the richness of the ornamentation, and in the unusual sensitivity and fantastic nature of the ob- jects. Harpoon foreshafts - usually undecorated - were found here covered with complicated ornament (Fig. 3). Six "winged objects" were recovered from graves, some of them fanciful to the point of being grotesque. Of particular interest are the amulets of walrus ivory (Fig. 4), in which the gifted ancient carvers were able to embody almost the entire gamut of game animals: representations of the heads of walrus, mountain sheep, seal, polar bear and some kind of a whale-like creature of such a composite nature that the same detail of the object in one fore- shortening represents a sheep horn and in another, walrus tusks, etc. Anthropomorphic representations - almost entirely of faces (only one figurine was found portraying the entire human body) - are very diverse; along with fully realistic ones there are also schematically executed examples. Tattooing in the form of bird tracks is represented on the cheek-bones of one specimen, along with labrets in the cheeks (Fig. 5). Deserving of special attention is the representation of a human face on a decorated object of walrus ivory of unknown function. It is a composition of elements of curvilinear design of Bering Sea type (Fig. 6). Also of interest are the models of kayaks (Fig. 7), adz handles and clay pots, all of walrus ivory, found in various graves. Several fragments of pottery with textile impressions were found. Noteworthy is the comparatively large quantity of objects made of bone and horn (or antler): punches, scoops, spatulas. Many well preserved wooden ob- jects were also found at Ekven, especially in burial No. 12. Here was found a bow which does not differ from those still in use among the Eskimos in the 19th</page><page sequence="4">146 century, a fragment of a spear thrower and a squared wooden shaft inserted into the socket of a "winged object" - the first such find, and of great importance for elucidating the purpose of this enigmatic object (Fig. 8). The complex construction of certain graves should also be mentioned. Wood was widely used in their construction: the bottom and sides are made of massive wooden blocks, the top of thinner ones. Whale bones were even more extensively employed - ribs, jaws, scapulas. For instance, burial No. 9 had side walls made of jaws, a floor of scapulas and a covering of ribs. Burial No. 15 had a cover- ing of two massive jaws resting on ribs placed crosswise, etc. As we said, the excavations at the Ekven cem- etery have just started. There is every reason to expect that further work at this site will provide important new material on the ancient culture of the Asiatic Eskimo The excavations in the Uelen and Ekven cem- eteries have yielded important craniological ma- terials. The series from Uelen numbers around 70 crania in various stages of preservation. Sixteen crania have so far been recovered from Ekven, where preservation of bone is very good. These represent the first cranial series assignable to the Old Bering Sea and Okvik cultures. (Only isolated crania are known from Collins1 excavations on St. Lawrence Island). The principal characteristics of these series may be mentioned. The craniological type of this ancient population who buried their dead at Uelen and Ekven is very close to that of the modern Eskimo with respect to the principal racially diagnostic traits. The series from the cemeteries differ from modern Asiatic and Alaskan Eskimo series chiefly in the structure of the vault - -the ancient crania being considerably longer, narrower and higher. The cranial index in the Uelen series is 71.6 for males and 70.8 for females. In the Ekven series the corresponding indices are 69.2 and 69.0. On the whole, the ancient series from Chukotka are closer to series of modern Eskimo from Labrador and Greenland. The Uelen and Ekven series are not completely identical. The crania from the Ekven cemetery are characterized by the considerably greater length of the vault and breadth of the malars. There are also differences in other traits. The considerable antiquity of the markedly dolichocranial type on the Asiatic shore of Bering Strait, which is demonstrated by the materials from these two cemeteries, is a new and very substan- tial argument in support of the view that this type preceded the mesocranial "western" type in the western part of the Eskimo territory. Any discus- sion of these problems, as well as a description of the ancient series, lies outside the scope of the present report. Arctic Anthropology 2, 1 BIBLIOGRAPHY Arutiunov, S. A. and D. A.
