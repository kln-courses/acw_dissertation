<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Divine as Inaccessible Object of Knowledge in Ancient Platonism: A Common Philosophical Pattern across Religious Traditions Ilaria Ramelli I. INTRODUCTION The notion of the divine as an inaccessible object of human knowledge and reasoning is prominent in philosophers - theologians of the first four centuries ce who display a refined cognitive approach to religion and a sophisticated treatment of the problem of "theo-logy." Greek 0soXoyia means reasoning and speaking (X,óyoç) about the divine (Oeóç), but if the divine is unknowable, how can theology work? Notably, these thinkers all belong to the same philosophical tradition, that of Platonism (so-called Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism), but they come from three different religious traditions. Philo of Alexandria (first century bce to first century ce) comes from Judaism, in particular Hellenistic Judaism. Plotinus (third century ce) comes from so-called "paganism," a general term for ancient cultic traditions other than Judaism and Christianity that is more useful than correct from the point of view of historians of religions.1 Finally, Ori- gen of Alexandria (second to third centuries ce) and Gregory of Nyssa 1 For a discussion of "paganism'V'Hellenism" as religion or culture in late antiquity see e.g. Aaron P. Johnson, Religion and Identity in Porphyry of Tyre.

Philo was a Jewish Platonist, Plotinus a "pagan" Platonist, and Origen and Gregory of Nyssa were Christian Platonists. Notwithstanding their affiliations to different religious traditions, these thinkers' reflections on the divine as an impossible cognitive object for humans are remarkably homogeneous. It will be argued that this homoge- neity is mainly due to their common philosophical tradition, which pro- vides them with a shared epistemological and ontological pattern. All of these philosopher-theologians share a dialectic and a tension between a declared apophaticism - the awareness that the divine is indeed an inacces- sible object of knowledge and expression for humans - and a discourse about the divine in which they nevertheless engage. It will therefore be nec- essary to clarify this dialectic. This will not have to be sought on the reli- gious plane, since the dialectic at stake is trans-religious and common to all of these imperial and late antique Platonists. II. PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY All of these thinkers were both philosophers and theologians. From our post-Kantian perspective, philosophy and theology are two independent disciplines, with different methodologies and objects, but this was not the case in late antiquity. From the viewpoint of Patristic philosophers, and especially Origen and Gregory of Nyssa, the study of God, i.e. theology, was the culmination of philosophy. This is why Origen did not teach theol- ogy without having taught the rest of philosophy first, and why he banned atheistic philosophical schools from his teaching, as his disciple Gregory Thaumaturgus attests in his panegyrical oration for Origen. In his Com- mentary on the Song of Songs prol. 3.2-4 Origen, after dividing philosophy into ethics ( ethica ), physics ( physica ), "epoptics" ( epoptica ), and logic (log- ica), posited epoptics as the crowning glory of philosophy.2 Epoptics is the branch of philosophy that investigates "the divine and heavenly things" (epoptica de divinis et caelestibus ), that is, theology. Thus Origen regarded Michael York, "Paganism as Root-Religion," The Pomegranate 6 (2004): 11-18 classifies religions as gnostic, dharmic, Abrahamic, and pagan; cf. York, Pagan Theology: Pagan- ism as a World Religion (New York: New York University Press, 2003). 2 Origen, Commentary on the Song of Songs prol. 3.2-4. 1 will cite all sources in classical style, whenever book, chapter, and/or paragraph numbers are available.

In his Homilies on Genesis 14.3, too, he admitted that "the learned of this world thanks to the study of philosophy [ per eruditionem philosophiae ] were able to grasp many truths."3 Among these truths he included theological tenets. For instance, "many philosophers write that God is one [unum esse Deum ] and created everything [cuncta creaverit ]. In this respect they agree with God's Law. Some also add that God both made and governs all by means of his Logos 'per Verbum suum ], and it is God's Logos that regulates all."4 Origen in this passage cited the traditional (Stoic) division of philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics, but interestingly ascribed to logic the realm of meta- physics and theology as well: "Logic is that part of philosophy which con- fesses God the father of all."5 The incongruence results from the fact that the tripartite division of philosophy was Stoic, and in Stoic immanentism both metaphysics and theology were reduced to physics. But Origen, who was no immanentist, could by no means accept such a reduction. For Philo, theology was essentially exegesis of Scripture, which is all about God, and this interpretation was to be performed through the lenses of philosophy, especially Platonism. His attention focused primarily on the Bible, as Valentin Nikiprowetzky, David Runia, Peder Borgen, and David Winston have rightly emphasized.6 Philo's approach was therefore exegetico-theological, but philosophy offered him an indispensable frame- work for his exegesis. In Plotinus's view, too, philosophy included the inves- tigation of the divine realm, which was metaphysics at its highest level. Indeed, Aristotle himself treated theology as a synonym of metaphysics as opposed to physics: "Three are the theoretical branches of philosophy: math- ematics, physics, and theology [[xa0rpcmxr|, cpvamļ, GeoXoyixn]."7 Thus, Plotinus's discourse on the One - attempted, suggestive, and limited at the same time, as will be pointed out shortly - is both protological and theolog- ical . 3 Origen, Homilies on Genesis 14.3. 4 Origen, Homilies on Genesis 14.3. 5 Origen, Homilies on Genesis 14.3. 6 Peder Borgen, Philo of Alexandria (Leiden: Brill, 1997); Valentin Nikiprowetzky, "L'ex- égèse de Philon d'Alexandrie," Revue d'Histoire et de Philosophie Religieuses 53 (1973): 309-29; Nikiprowetzky, Le commentaire de l'écriture chez Philon d'Alexandrie (Leiden: Brill, 1977); David T.

PHILO Philo oř Alexandria interpreted the Hebrew Bible (in its Greek translation, the Septuagint or LXX) in the light of Platonic philosophy, and indeed he has many themes in common with so-called Middle Platonism.8 He could read Scripture with Platonic lenses thanks to an allegorical interpretation. This is what Christian interpreters of the Bible such as Origen and Gregory of Nyssa would do as well. However, unlike some extreme Jewish Hellenis- tic allegorists against whom he seems to have reacted, Philo did not reject the historical aspect of Scripture. He kept both the historical and the alle- gorical planes at the same time.9 Likewise, the roots of Philo's apophaticism and mysticism, too, are found in his biblical exegesis.10 Philo interpreted some biblical episodes as the allegorical expression of the necessity of apophaticism: this meant the awareness of the limit of human cognitive and discursive-expressive power when it came to the divinity in itself, that is, its nature or essence as distinct from its activities and their products. This clearly presupposed a transcen- dent notion of the divinity, which squares with Platonism but not with an immanentistic system such as Stoicism (the latter influenced Philo as well, but more on the ethical than the ontological plane). These allegorical expressions appeared precisely in passages which have been fruitfully com- pared11 with the parallel interpretations of Origen and Gregory of Nyssa. This meant that there was a strong continuity in this respect between Philo, Origen, and Gregory of Nyssa. Indeed, Philo inspired Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Gregory of Nyssa with the principle that the divinity is unknowable in its essence (oůoía), and therefore also ineffable, but knowable through its activity . Indeed, "What Is cannot be grasped from itself alone, without anything else, but only through its works, either qua creator or qua ruler."12 The 8 1 limit myself to referring to the synthesis offered by David T. Runia, "Philon d'Alexan- drie," in Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques , ed. Richard Goulet, vol. 5/a (Paris: CNRS, 2011), 363-90. 9 See Ilaria L.E.

These two aspects are kept distinct from one another. What humans can know about God is that God is, 15 but not what God is. Because of God's transcendence, human intellects cannot grasp the divine essence, but some help to this end can come from the revelation of God in Scripture.16 For Philo, just as for Clement, Origen, and Gregory, divine revelation in Scripture represents an important factor that moderates negative theology. It is a gnoseological factor in that it allows human beings to know something of the divinity, which would otherwise be precluded. This cognitive factor, however, is subject to strict rules of interpretation. Allegoresis, in the sense of the allegorical exegesis of the sacred text - in this case, that of Scripture, but in the case of "pagan" Neoplatonists, for instance, poetry and various forms of traditional myths and rituals - is the key to grasping the true meaning of the Bible, but it is also a key available to few, those who master this hermeneutical tool. This tendency to exclusiv- ity in relation to allegoresis is particularly evident in Clement and, to a degree, in Origen, but also in "pagan" Middle Platonists and Neoplato- nists, from Plutarch to Porphyry to Sallustius, who cherished allegoresis. Just as Clement, Origen, and Gregory of Nyssa after him, Philo bases his apophatic theology on Exod. 20:21, the passage in which Moses enters the darkness where God is: "Now the people were standing at a distance, but Moyses went into the darkness where God was." Philo and his follow- ers interpret this darkness (oxótoç) as a reference to God's unknowability.17 Non-seeing is a metaphor of human cognitive impairment before the divine. 13 Philo, The Changing of Names 10; 15. On God's ineffability in Philo see Sean Mc- Donough, YHWH at Patmos: Rev. 1:4 in its Hellenistic and Early Jewish Setting (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1999), 79-84.

This is a remarkable limitation to "theo-logy" (Öeo-Xoyia), reasoning and discourse on the divine. The divinity in its own nature is an inaccessible object of human intellectual sight, that is, of human epistemic equipment. In Exod. 33:20-23, God says to Moses that he will be unable to see his face, but he will only see his back: "You shall not be able to see my face. For a person shall never see my face and live. . . . You shall stand on the rock. Now, whenever my glory passes by, then I will put you in a hole of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I pass by. And I will take my hand away, and then you shall see my hind parts, but my face will not appear to you." By means of his allegorical exegesis, Philo refers this pas- sage, as well, to God's unknowability.18 Philo's interpretation - which, as will be pointed out, was followed by Origen and Gregory of Nyssa - is that God's existence is easy to grasp, whereas God's essence is unknowable. However, the search for God is the noblest among human activities. Thus, the cognitive impairment of human beings before the divine should not stop their "theo- logical" investigation. In On Flight 165, too, Philo interprets Exod. 33:23 ("you shall see my hind parts, but my face will not appear to you") in the sense that only what is "behind" God, "at his back," is know- able to human beings: God says: "You will see my back parts [xà ÔJtíoco], but my face [xò jtqóocojtov] you will not behold." For it is sufficient for the wise man to know what comes after and follows [ta àxóXovOa xai éjtófieva], and the things which are after God [öoa jxexà xòv 0eóv]; but he who wishes to see the principal Essence [xfļv Ô' r|Y8^ovixrļv oůaíav] will be blinded by the exceeding brilliancy of its rays before he can see it.19 The visual metaphor of blindness due to the excessive brightness of the divine essence is typical of Philo.20 As will be demonstrated below, Gregory of Nyssa followed Philo in his exegesis of precisely this biblical passage in 18 Philo The Special Laws 1.32.50. 19 Philo On Flight 165. 20 Francesca Calabi, "La luce che abbaglia: una metafora della inconoscibilità di Dio in Filone," in Origeniana , voi. 8, Origene e la tradizione alessandrina , ed.

PLOTINUS Like the Jewish exegete Philo, the "pagan" Neoplatonist Plotinus was also convinced that it was impossible for human beings to comprehend and describe the essence of God. This is the supreme principle, what Plotinus calls the One or e'Ev. For him, humans can only cognitively grasp, under- stand and express what is "around" the divinity and "what concerns it" or xà Jtepi auTOÛ (exactly this notion will appear again in the writings of Gregory of Nyssa, who was very well acquainted with Plotinus's thought). Already Numenius, a Neopythagorean and Middle Platonist well known to Plotinus as well as to Origen, maintained that "the first Intellect [voûç], which is called absolute Being, is entirely unknown to humans." 22 The One, however, for Plotinus is even beyond Being, just as it is beyond the Intellect (Novç). The latter proceeds from the One as a second hypostasis or principle, but the One is above it. According to Plotinus, human cognitive sight and language imply a separation between the subject who sees and speaks, and the object of this sight and speaking. As a result, human intellection and language pertain not to the One, but to duality; as such, they begin only at the level of the Intellect, one step after the One.23 Therefore, the One, the supreme principle 21 David Bradshaw, "The Vision of God in Philo of Alexandria," American Catholic Phil- osophical Quarterly 72 (1998): 483-500. Philo was received in Patristic mysticism more than in ancient Jewish mysticism; on the latter see e.g. Peter Schaefer, The Hidden and Manifest God: Some Major Themes in Early Jewish Mysticism (Albany: SUNY Press, 1992); Daniel Matt, "Varieties of Mystical Nothingness: Jewish, Christian, and Buddhist Perspectives," Studia Philonica Annual 9 (1997): 316-31; Joseph Dan, Ancient Jewish Mysticism (New York: Mod Books, 1990); Ori Sokes, Mysticism in Judaism , Christianity , and Islam: Searching for Oneness (Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008). 22 fr. 17 Des Places.

This is because the One, as already mentioned, is anterior and supe- rior to the Intellect, which is the second principle in Plotinus's metaphysical scheme, and qua talis is inferior to the One. Plotinus's triad of first princi- ples - the three agxinai vjiooxáoeiç: the One, the Intellect, and the Soul - is indeed strictly hierarchical. The second principle derives from, and is subor- dinated to, the first; in turn the third principle derives from, and is subordi- nated to, the second.24 Thus, the One comes before, and is beyond, any human act of intellection and any cognitive grasp. This is why we humans can only "limit ourselves to say something that concerns it" or that "is about/around it."25 Plotinus explains the main reason why it is impossible to "touch" and "grasp" the One: because the One, which is "beyond Being" (èjtéxeiva ovtoç), is infinite (ajteiQOv), and "it is ridiculous to try to grasp and circum- scribe what is infinite by nature."26 Plotinus also uses the reverse argument: not only can the One not be grasped intellectually because it is infinite, but moreover it is infinite because its power cannot be grasped or encompassed: "It is necessary to conceive the One as infinite . . . because its power is impossible to comprehend."27 As will be demonstrated, this argument is also paramount for Gregory of Nyssa's negative theology, which owes much to that of Plotinus. Plotinus insists that the One, which is infinite, can be contemplated only on the basis of finite realities, because humans cannot grasp the infinite and indefinite (cbreipov, àÓQioxov): "If your mind cannot find anything definite because the One is none of these things, you just stick to these, and contemplate on their basis."28 In Plotinus's view, the One can be known and expressed only in the negative: "We say what is not , but what is, we cannot say."29 This is the Neoplatonism: Non-Discursive Thinking in the Texts of Plotinus , Proclus , and Damas- cius (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000). 24 On the possible influence of Origen on Porphyry's characterization of Plotinus's three principles see Ilaria L. E. Ramelli, "Origen, Greek Philosophy, and the Birth of the Trini- tarian Meaning of Hypostasis," Harvard Theological Review 105 (2012): 302-50.

The use of many negative adjectives in reference to the supreme principle or first divinity was already deployed in Middle Platonism: for instance, âpQrycoç, "ineffable," âc()08YXXoç, "unspeakable," àjrsQÍYQajrxoç, "impossible to cir- cumscribe," 'ir' e/cov jrépaç, "unlimited," etc.30 This trend will continue in "pagan" and Christian Platonism as well, as will soon be clear. According to Plotinus, due to the very superiority of the One to the Intellect, to Being, and to finitude, humans can have no knowledge of the One on the cogni- tive-epistemological plane: "neither knowledge nor intellective intuition of it."31 This would later be emphasized by Proclus.32 For this reason it is necessary for the soul to go far from science and all of its objects, because every knowledge and every science implies a multiplicity and therefore detaches the soul from unity and the One itself. In fact, whenever the intel- lect knows, this immediately produces a duality of knower and known: For science is reasoning, and reasoning entails multiplicity [Xóyoç yàç) f| smarriti] jzoKkà ôè ó Xóyoç].

The One cannot be expressed or even thought, since this immediately implies a duality and multiplicity, but the philosopher, never- theless, does speak of it. He or she does so not in a positive or assertive way, but by way of indication, to give hints to those who want to contemplate: The One cannot be said or written - and nevertheless we speak and write , to lead people toward it [jiéfxjtovxeç eíç ouxó] and to awaken them from the slumber of words / reasonings to the wake of contemplation [àvayeÍQOvreç èx tcòv ^óycov èjti tt]v 0éav], as though we indicated the way [coojteQ óôòv ôeixvúvreç] to those who want to contemplate.35 This methodological statement by Plotinus is also fundamental to keep the "mystical" union with the One (which he is going to describe) within the realm and scope of philosophy. Union with the One thus becomes a kind of apophatic culmination of the theological branch of philosophy. At the same time, Plotinus likely wanted to mark the distinction between this union at the limit of philosophy and any such experience promoted by mystery reli- gions. Plotinus's philosophical theology is notoriously different from later Neoplatonists' religious-theurgical drift. Olympiodorus classified Proclus, together with his inspirers Iamblichus and Syrianus, among the "religious" exponents of Neoplatonism, as opposed to the "philosophical" exponents such as Plotinus and Porphyry: "Some, such as Plotinus, Porphyry, etc., give priority to philosophy; others, such as Iamblichus, Syrianus, Proclus, and the whole priestly school, give priority to the priestly art," ieQ(XTixr|.36 For Plotinus the One cannot be known intellectually (by the intuitive intellect, voíjç), let alone reached by means of a discursive approach (through ôiávoia or discursive reason), but can be contemplated in ecstasy . At the epistemological level, this difference is decisive. Philosophical dis- course on God, on the supreme Principle (the One), is a hint to mystical union with God. Humans cannot gaze at God, neither with their physical nor with their intellectual sight, but they can experience God in another way: in a mystical experience. This is an ecstasy, a mystical union: 34 Nelson Pike, Mystic Union: An Essay in the Phenomenology of Mysticism (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992). 35 Plotinus Enneads 6.9.4. 36 Damascius, Commentary on Plato's Phaedo 1.172. 176</page><page sequence="11">Ramelli ♦ The Divine in Ancient Platonism The comprehension [crùveaiç] of the One can be attained neither through science [xax' smcmļļiTiv] nor through intellection [xaxà voTļoiv], as in the case of the other intelligible beings, but thanks to a presence [xaxà Jtapovaíav] that means more than science [èmaxrmTiç xpeixxova]. . . . The One is present [jrapcov].37 This reception, which is meta-cognitive proper, is called by Plotinus Jiíaxiç, "trust/faith," a term which in Plotinus receives a much more positive connotation than in Plato. Indeed, Plato ranked Jtíoxiç with eixaaia ("rep- resentation, apprehension through shadows, conjecture") at the lower tiers of knowledge, far inferior to discursive reason (ôiávoia) and intuitive in- tellect (vovç). However, Plotinus's moxiç bears a different sense than Christian Jiíaxtç, "faith."38 This act of meta-cognitive comprehension for Plotinus is not an epistemic possession, which, as has been pointed out, would immediately imply dualism and separation. Rather, it is the action of receiving the One as present , in an authentic union: It will be sufficient to be able to touch it in an intelligible way [vo8Q(bç èc^áipaoBai] [. . .] Only later will it be possible to reflect [auXÀOYÍÇea0ai] on it.

This "touching" is "something better and greater than knowing it" or elôévai, the verb that expresses the cognitive grasping of objects.40 This experience can be done only by means of abstraction from everything else.

Here Plotinus warns that "it is impossible to grasp [vofjaai] the One until in the soul there is the impression [tújtoç] of something else." Therefore, in order to contemplate the One, the soul "must leave all external realities [jtcxvtcov tü)v £§o) acķefiēviļv] and turn entirely toward its interiority [ejtioīpa^fļvai jtqòç xò eïoco JtavTTļ] . . . after giving up knowing everything [ayvoriaavta tà jrávxa], first sense-perceptible objects and then the intelligible forms themselves, one should forget even the knowledge of oneself [ayvor|aavTa ôè xai afrtóv]." The negation of all knowledge and the abstraction from all objects of knowledge bring the soul toward the One in a theology that is "negative" in that it draws on such a negation and abstraction. Forgetting even the knowledge of oneself is the peak of this abstractive process; Chris- tian mystics will build on this and conceive mysticism as a self-offering.42 Abstraction was indicated already in Middle Platonism, by Alcinous, as a way that leads to some knowledge of God on a par with the analogical way.43 These would later be labeled via negationis and via analogiae respec- tively. Likewise Plutarch and Clement of Alexandria presented abstraction as a way to contemplation - Clement in particular as a means to ascend to the first Intellect, Noôç.44 Porphyry would follow his teacher Plotinus with regard to abstraction.45 Indeed, for Plotinus the One is present in silence. Since the One has no existence (tò ļirļ vjrocraxv), one must stop any rational investigation into it and be silent.46 The One is the silence that remains after the removal of the Difference that necessarily exists between the subject and the object of 41 Ibid. 3.17; cf. 6.7.36; 6.8.21. 42 James Wetzel, "What the Saints Know: Quasi-Epistemological Reflections," in The Wiley-B lackwell Companion to Christian Mysticism , ed.

V. ORIGEN OF ALEXANDRIA Origen was a fellow-student of Plotinus at Ammonius Saccas's school in Alexandria, and he can probably be identified with the homonymous Neo- platonist mentioned by Porphyry in the Life of Plotinus, by Proclus, and by other Neoplatonists.48 Like Philo the Jew, Origen the Christian supported the thesis of the incomprehensibility of God's nature or essence on the epi- stemic plane, and the possibility for humans to know only God's works and activities (egy a and evegyeiai): In the limits of our scarce forces, we have known the divine nature [divina natura ] by considering it more from its works [ex operum suorum contemplât ione] than through our cognitive capacity [ex nostri sensu contemplatone ]. We have observed its visible crea- tures and have known by faith those invisible, because human frailty [humana fragilitas ] cannot see everything with its eyes and know everything with its reason [ratione complecti' . For the human being is the weakest and most imperfect among all rational beings.49 47 "Tfļv ôè ēx8Ģ0xrļxa, ÎV fj vooûv xai vooú^ievov.

More - albeit with a different perspective than in the present essay - in John Dillon, "The 179</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ APRIL 2014 There is something that is precluded to human sight: God's nature. In his Commentary on the Gospel of John 19.6.35-38, in a passage that will exert a strong influence on Gregory of Nyssa, Origen claims that God's nature and power (c|&gt;t&gt;ôiç and Stivante;)50 are even beyond being (ovaia). Thus, humans cannot reach them: they cannot "see and observe" (ÓQÕoôai) or "contemplate" (0eo)Qeiv) or "perceive" (voeîv) them, but barely "peer at " (èviôeîv) them. This is precisely a verb for a difficult object of observa- tion, be it physical or intellectual sight (i.e. cognitive faculty). According to Origen, the Godhead cannot be known by human rea- son,51 and yet it is mysteriously intelligible, "intelligible thanks to an in- effable power or faculty" (aģ(*r'T(p tivi ôwá^iei voí1XÓç), even though it transcends everything.52 In particular, God transcends being or ovaia and intellect or voûç,53 but at the same time is also the supreme Being.54 Indeed, only the "invisible and incorporeal nature" (((nJôiç àÓQaxoç xai àacó^iaxoç) of God is Being in the fullest and most proper sense.55 Every other being is a being, an ovoia, exclusively by virtue of participation in the Being that is God.56 Origen felt the need to maintain the identity between God and the absolute Being because of Exod. 3:14, which in the Septuagint reads: eyco eijji ó ö)v, "I am the One who Is." This, from the biblical side; but he also wanted to stick to Plato's identification of the Being and the Good. The divinity is the Good and the Being, while evil, its opposite, is non-being. This idea will return in Gregory of Nyssa and other Christian Platonists such as Evagrius, Ps. Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor. Origen, for instance, declares that "evils are not substances / beings."57 Unlike crea- tures, which are good insofar as they participate in the Good, the divinity is the Good. It is the Good itself, avToayaQóv - a Numenian term - by essence.58 God is the absolute Good, the Good per se. Knowledge of God in Origen," in Knowledge of God in the Graeco-Roman World , ed.

Iamblichus knew Origen's thought and seems to have been influ- enced by it in various respects, as is emerging from ongoing research. After speaking of the epistemic process of deducing God's essence on the basis of God's activity and works in creation, Origen describes God as a Monad and Henad ("a unity") in On First Principles 1.1.6. Since God is "an intelligible nature" and not material or corporeal, Origen argues, the Godhead is "simple [intellectualis natura simplex ]; absolutely nothing can be added to it . . . but it is a Monad [(iováç] in an absolute sense, and, so to say, a Henad [éváç]: intelligence and spring from which every intelligence gushes out." This passage is extant in Rufinus of Aquileia's Latin trans- lation, but it is noteworthy that Rufinus chose to leave Origen's original Greek terms for "monad" and "henad," without translating them. This is probably because he considered them to be technical terms. Thus, in Ori- gen's view, the Godhead is the principle of everything, and therefore we must not deem it composite. This absolute simplicity takes God away from the grasp of human knowledge, just as it does the One according to Ploti- nus, as has been pointed out above. Consistent with this, in On First Principles 1.1.5 Origen illustrates the excellence and cognitive incomprehensibility of the Godhead, who is incomprehensible and impenetrable in its reality. Every human thought is inevitably inferior to, and cannot grasp, the Godhead itself, just as a spark is infinitely inferior to the splendor of the sun. So is human intelligence inferior to the intellectual and spiritual realities, and these in turn are inferior to God. God is superior to all of these, ineffably and inestimably excellent. This is a development of the Platonic metaphysical model of tran- scendence. VI. GREGORY OF NYSSA Gregory of Nyssa, the youngest and most philosophically minded of the Cappadocian Fathers, is the most insightful follower of Origen and the 59 Origen On First Principles 2.9.1; 3.5.2; 4.4.8. 60 Iamblichus On Mysteries 1.5.18. 181</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ APRIL 2014 greatest Patristic Platonist along with Origen himself and Augustine of Hippo. His reflections on apophaticism are marked by a profound influence of Philo and, above all, of Origen and Plotinus. Indeed, he was very well acquainted with the works and thought of all of these Platonists. In his Homilies on Ecclesiastes Gregory interprets Ecclesiastes 3:7 (a verse concerning "a time to speak and a time to be silent") as follows: "The time to be silent is when one wants to investigate the nature of God , whereas the time to speak is when one wants to announce the wonders of his works"61 Like Plotinus, Gregory thinks that the very essence or nature of God is impossible to express and must lie in silence. In Against Eunomius 2.1.105, Gregory declares that divine realities, which "exceed both word and discursive thought [xà vtibq Xóyov te xaì ôiávoiav]," must be "hon- ored with silence" (qicdjcQ xi|xâa0at). What can be grasped cognitively and can therefore be expressed is God's activity in the world, first of all the Creation.62 Like Plotinus, Philo, and Origen, indeed, Gregory maintains that God's nature or essence (ovoia) "is known only in the impossibility of being understood [xataX,rļ(ļ)0fļvai]." 63 This is why Gregory, for instance, in his dialogue On the Soul and the Resurrection - an intentional Christian remake of Plato's Phaedo64 - uses a great many negative adjectives in refer- ence to God. For example, God is invisible, unspeakable, impossible to define, incorporeal, immaterial, impalpable, unlimited, non-dimensional, and God's essence is inaccessible. God's essence is a precluded cognitive object, and its characteristics must be inferred by analogy; its existence is revealed by the contemplation of the world (Psalm 18:2: "The heavens are telling of divine glory, and the firmament proclaims his handiwork"). Like Plotinus, in fact, Gregory maintains that only by analogy can God be known, and this to a very limited extent. In his Homilies on the Song of Songs Gregory remarks that, since God's infinite nature is inaccessible to human minds, we must proceed by conjecture. We must start from our knowledge of the world, and "try to represent to ourselves the incompre- hensible by means of what we can comprehend, on the basis of a certain analogy ."65 61 Gregorii Nysseni Opera 5 p. 414. 62 Especially on Gregory of Nyssa see also Philipp Renczes, "The Patristic Notion of 'Divine Grace' on the Horizon of Apophatic Theology," in Silenzio e parola nella patris- tica (Rome: Augustinianum, 2012), 39-53. 63 Gregory of Nyssa Against Eunomius 1.373. 64 On this dialogue, with commentary, see Ilaria Ramelli, Gregorio di Nissa Sull'anima e la resurrezione (Milan: Bompiani-Catholic University, 2007); reviews by Panayiotis Tzamalikos, Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008): 515-23; and Mark Edwards, Journal of Ecclesiastical History 60 (2009): 764-65. 65 "êx xivoç àvaXoyíaç": Gregorii Nysseni Opera 6.36-38. 182</page><page sequence="17">Ramelli ♦ The Divine in Ancient Platonism The infinity of God is a crucial point in Gregory of Nyssa's negative theology, and this point partially depends on Plotinus.66 The latter, as dem- onstrated earlier, used the following double argument: not only that the One cannot be grasped intellectually because it is infinite, but also that it is infinite because its power cannot be grasped or encompassed. The same argument is repeated by Gregory of Nyssa, who draws on both Plotinus and Origen on this score: the divinity is impossible to grasp precisely because it is infinite.67 God's nature is consequently impossible to "touch" and "conceive" (àvéjtac|)ov, àxaxavórjTOv), and it is "superior to any grasp [àvTÍXrjtyiç]" provided by reasoning.68 Gregory, like Plotinus (and Philo), ascribed infinity to God - but not to evil. "Only what is contrary to Beauty and the Good is limited, whereas the Good, whose nature is not susceptible of evil, will progress toward the unlimited and infinite."69 Gregory thus posited God as ajtetQOV, and evil as limited, in that it is the opposite of God. It is not to be ruled out that Gregory was consciously "correcting" Plotinus, who, in turn following Plato, described as ajieipov both absolute evil and the One.70 Gregory probably realized that, if evil is ajtetQOV and the One / Good / Godhead too is ajreiQOV, there is not enough opposition between the two, which there- fore risk telescoping into one another. Gregory of Nyssa's apophatic theology - the awareness that the di- vinity in itself can be known and spoken of only in negative terms - refers to the specific area of God's transcendence. God's nature or essence (((yúaiç or ovaia), infinite as it is, cannot be known, whereas God's activi- ties or operations (èvépyeLCXi) can be known and spoken of. This is the same line as Philo's and Origen's. In his treatise To Ablabius: There Are Not Three Gods , Gregory states that names do not reveal God's nature , what the Godhead is in its essence, since this is "unnamable and ineffa- ble" (àxaxovó^iaoxóv xe xai a^paoxov). Rather, names describe some- thing of what pertains to it (literally: what is "about/around it" [jtepi 66 Although the connection with Plotinus is not investigated, the centrality of God's infin- ity to Gregory's apophaticism is caught by Ari Ojell, "The Constitutive Elements of the Apophatic System of Gregory of Nyssa," in Studia Patristica , vol. 41, eds.

Now, this something "does not at all indicate what divine nature is in its essence [xax' oiiaiav]."71 The divinity, invisible in its nature , becomes visible in its works , and can thus be understood by human intellects in some respects concerning its nature (literally, again: "abouti around if [jrepi ouTtļv]). Here, too, Greg- ory relies not only on Plotinus, but also on Origen, Against Celsus 6.65, who used in a similar sense the expression "what is around/about," xa JT8QÍ. This phrase in turn was already employed by Clement of Alexandria, between the second and the third century ce, in a passage that deals pre- cisely with the abstractive process in the human cognitive grasp of God.72 Origen elaborated on the same concept and expression in Commentary on the Gospel of John 13.21.124: it is possible to find in Scripture clues to say "something" (ti) "regarding God's nature or essence," Jtepi ovoíaç 0eoû. The same concept and expression is also found in Plotinus, in Enneads 5.3.14: the One is ineffable, a(i$T]TOv, because to say "something about it" is, after all, "to say something," xi, but the One is not merely "some thing," that is, a thing among all others. The very same idea and expression will be found again in another "Origenian," a milestone in Christian apophati- cism: the early sixth-century Neoplatonist called Ps. Dionysius the Areo- pagite, who was deeply influenced by Proclus.73 Gregory specifically follows Philo in his interpretation of Exod. 20:21, the passage in which Moses enters the darkness where God is.74 Like Philo and Origen after him, Gregory draws a distinction between God's essence or nature , unknowable, and God's existence , knowable and actually known. He draws the same connection as Philo did between Exod. 20:21 ("Moyses went into the darkness where God was") and Psalm 17:12 ("He made darkness his hideaway; around him was his tent, dark water in clouds of air") in reference to the very same allegorical interpretation of the cogni- tive inaccessibility of God's nature.

Philo, as already indicated, referred this passage to God's unknowability in The Spe- cial Laws 1.32.50, and so does Gregory. Gregory indeed follows Philo in his exegesis of Exod. 33:23 in reference to apophaticism, and, in this case just as in many others,78 he follows him through the lenses of Origen. Greg- ory observes that this episode must be interpreted allegorically, since it has no literal meaning, because it speaks of the "back" of God. This entails a notion of corporeality, and therefore an anthropomorphism, which is absurd in reference to God. God has no back, since God has no body what- soever. God is incorporeal: this is a tenet of Platonism - against Stoicism and Epicureanism, for instance. On the same grounds Philo also denied any anthropomorphic feature in God, but Gregory's argument and terminology evidently stick to Ori- gen's theory of Scriptural allegoresis in On First Principles 4. Here the absurdities at the literal level of Scripture (àôúvaxa and akoya , "things that are impossible and illogical" according to Aristotelian literary-critic terminology79) are said to reveal that the passages that include them cannot be interpreted literally, but must be understood allegorically. Exactly divine anthropomorphisms - the attribution of human or material characteristics to God - such as the notion of "the back of God" are a kind of "absurdity" that Origen adduced as a reason to reject the literal meaning of a biblical passage and interpret it allegorically. The notion of God's face is of course no less anthropomorphic than that of God's back, but Philo, Origen, and Gregory tend not to choose this as an example of blatant anthropomor- phism. All of them, however, do interpret both God's face and God's back allegorically. 75 Origen Against Celsus 6.17; Commentary on the Gospel of John 2.172; and Fragments from the Exegesis of the Gospel of Luke 162. 76 This has been argued in Ramelli, "Philosophical Allegoresis." 77 On this tradition see e.g. Denys Turner, The Darkness of God: Negativity in Christian Mysticism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996). 78 As is demonstrated in Ramelli, Philosophical Allegoresis. 79 Aristotle inquired into àôvvaxa in literature, especially myth, in Poetics 1460ab.

Rob- ert Lamberton and John Keeney (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992), 30-40. 185</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ APRIL 2014 There are further proofs of how Gregory did know Philo's exegesis of a biblical passage, but decided to keep closer to Origen's exegesis of that passage. Gregory links Exod. 33:23 (interpreted as an exhortation to follow God) with Deut. 13:4, which speaks of "walking after God," and with Psalm 62:9, about sticking to "the back of God." The same connection had been drawn by Origen.80 Gregory, on the other hand, chose not to interpret the words "my back," "what is behind me" in an eschatological sense.81 In so doing he left aside the eschatological exegesis of those words - perhaps to be traced back to Philo, On Flight 165: "what comes after and fol- lows" - which Origen knew and developed.82 In the second of Gregory of Nyssa's Homilies on the Song of Songs , the soul, personified as a character in a dialogue, addresses God as follows: "Your Name is beyond any other name and is inexpressible and incompre- hensible to any rational being." Likewise in Homily 6: "How is it possible that the One who is beyond every name be found by means of the pronun- ciation of a name?" Indeed, "the divine, from the point of view of its nature, is ungraspable / untouchable [àvéjraqpov] and incomprehensible [àxaxavÓT1TOv] . . . ineffable [aģģīļtov] and inaccessible [avemßaxov] to reasoning."83 This is why we know only its existence, and not its essence.84 This is what Philo also maintained, as has been remarked above. In his sixth Homily on the Beatitudes , Gregory insists that "the divine nature , in what it is per se, is beyond any thought that can comprehend it, inaccessible and unapproachable to every conjectural intuition." Likewise in Against Eunomius 2.67tí. he illustrates the impossibility of grasping intellectually and expressing the divine substance. He does so by interpret- ing the migration of Abraham as an allegory of the soul's ascent to the One, that is to say, the Plotinian One identified by Gregory with God the Trin- ity.85 Gregory explains that from knowledge based on sense-perception, symbolized by "Chaldaean" wisdom, one can pass on to the intelligible realm by analogy.

Then he considered it a sure and clear clue of the knowledge of God to believe that the Godhead is beyond every sign that provides its knowledge.86 In Gregory's Homilies on the Song of Songs negative and positive the- ology intermingle,87 after the model of Origen's commentary on the Song of Songs. In the twelfth homily Gregory hammers home and further devel- ops the same apophatic thesis: As for what always turns out to be beyond any impression that can reveal it , how could it ever be understood by means of an indication included in this or that name ? This is why the soul excogitates every meaning of names , in order to indicate that inex- pressible Good , but every discursive capacity of reasoning is always defeated and declared inferior to the object that it is look- ing for. This is why the soul says: "I have called him as I could, excogitating words that indicate its inexpressible beatitude, but he was always superior to the indication suggested by their mean- ings" The same experience often happens to the great David as well, who invokes God with an infinity of names, and yet recog- nizes that he has remained inferior to the truth. For Gregory, just as for Philo, by means of names we can only say " how God is" (jicoç èoxi), and not " what God is [tí boti]."88 Divine names are established by humans "on the basis of each of the divine activities [èvéQyeiai] that we know"89; "the divine is denominated with different appellatives which refer to its manifold activities"90 Indeed, the divinity, 86 Gregory of Nyssa, Against Eunomins 2.89. 87 This is noted by Martin Laird, "Apophasis and Logophasis in Gregory of Nyssa's Com- mentarius in Canticum Canti corum" in Studia Patristica , vol. 37, ed.

VII. CONCLUSION The notion of the divine as an inaccessible object of human thought and reasoning is very similar in these philosopher-theologians - Philo, Plotinus, Origen, and Gregory - who belonged to the same Platonic philosophical tradition, but to three different religious traditions. The similarity of their reflections on the divine as an inaccessible epistemic object for humans, which can nevertheless be experienced in a meta-cognitive way, seems due to their common philosophical tradition. Most interestingly, all of these thinkers show a tension between the apophaticism they declare - repeatedly proclaiming that the divine is an impossible object of human thought and language - and the discourse about the divine (0eo-Xayia) that none of them gives up developing. In order to be able to say something of the divine, notwithstanding all, they pursue the strategy of differentiation. That is, they establish that the divine's intimate nature or essence is inaccessible, and indeed does not offer itself as a cognitive object, but that the divine manifests itself in its effects. For Philo, Origen, and Gregory, moreover, the divine manifests itself through Scripture. Unlike Plotinus, they considered the Bible to be the reve- lation of the divinity. However, Plotinus also postulated a direct access to the divine, not through a cognitive, intellectual process, but through the mystical experience, which allows one to "touch" what one cannot "see" with the eyes of the body or of the soul. This possibility, too, was admitted both by Philo and by Origen and Gregory of Nyssa. Philosophical discourse about the divine, "theo-logy," is thus described by Plotinus as an indica- tion, a hint, that points to the mystical, non-dualistic experience of an object (God) that, qua object of knowledge and therefore qua epistemic object, is inaccessible.
