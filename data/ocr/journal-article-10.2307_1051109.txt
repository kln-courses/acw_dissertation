<plain_text><page sequence="1">COVENANT AND CONTRACT: A FRAMEWORK FOR THE ANALYSIS OF JEWISH ETHICS Louis E. Newman * I. THE CENTRALITY OF COVENANT One way of describing the incarnate character of radical faith in the life of Israel is to say that for this people all human relations were transformed into covenant relations. Promise-making and promise-keeping were the essential elements in every connection between persons. Religion became such a matter of covenant.1 The fact that covenant played a central role in the religious life of ancient Israel has long been recognized by historians, theologians and other careful leaders of the biblical text. Walther Eichrodt's monu- mental Theology of the Old Testament remains perhaps the best known and most extensive treatment of covenant themes in the He- brew Bible. But in recent years biblical scholars and theologians as diverse as Jon Levenson, James Muilenberg, Eugene Borowitz, Rose- mary Ruether and David Hartman have increasingly devoted their attention to the concept of covenant, both its biblical roots and its persistence as a central category of religious life for Jews and Chris- tians into the moder era.2 Yet, the implications of covenant for Jewish ethics have not re- ceived the attention they merit. To be sure, it is universally acknowl- edged that Jews, traditionally speaking, have understood their religious obligations within the context of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.3 And some have noted that, as a conse- * Associate Professor of Religion and Director of the Program in Judaic Studies, Carle- ton College, Northfield, Minnesota.

This corporate, communal relationship between God and Israel does not preclude a more personal relationship between the individual Jew and God, 89</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION quence of this, Jewish ethics are addressed to members of a cove- nanted community, rather than to autonomous individuals.4 Some have also explored the tensions within the covenant idea between par- ticularism and universalism, while others have distinguished between the conditional and unconditional dimensions of the covenantal rela- tionship.5 Still, there has been no systematic effort to correlate the category of covenant in all its richness and subtlety with diverse streams within Jewish ethics. My goal here is to take some preliminary steps in this direction. I will first explicate the category of covenant in Jewish tradition in relation to the concept of contract in the Anglo-American legal tradi- tion, and then sketch its implications for Jewish ethics. Before doing so, I should say a word about analyzing the concept of covenant in terms of a legal category like contract. At first glance, it might appear problematic to analyze religious categories in terms of secular ones. Indeed, in another context I have argued that this can generate "pseudo-problems," issues that arise precisely because religious data often do not fit neatly into Western philosophic categories.6 Yet, in this instance, American legal concepts may be apposite to the task. In the first place, numerous studies have traced the influence of Puritan ideas about covenant and religious community upon the development of early American legal thinking.7 In the work of Locke and Hobbes, for instance, the social contract was modeled on the notion of a cove- nanted community, both in ancient Israel and in the contemporary reformed churches which were influenced by Calvinist thought. Given that our most fundamental legal and social institutions were modeled, however indirectly, on biblical covenants, it makes sense to which may carry its own religious and moral obligations. Indeed, Jewish literature is replete with accounts of saints and holy individuals who exemplified just such an intense, personal piety. In a traditional context, however, these personal religious obligations can never super- sede or supplant the religious obligations of the individual as a member of Israel. It is as a member of that covenanted community that the individual Jew has a relationship with God in the first place. 4. D.

Moreover, Harold Berman has argued that the foundations of contract law can be traced back through canon law to certain biblical norms about taking oaths.8 To the extent that such an historical connection exists, there is good reason to suppose that an analysis of biblical models of covenant in terms of contract theory may shed some light on the nature of cove- nantal theology and ethics. This exploration of covenant theology and ethics investigates two basic questions: first, what sort of relationship is this covenant be- tween God and Israel, and second, in the context of this covenant, how does Israel understand the nature and significance of its moral life? The biblical text offers more than one model of the covenant between God and Israel,9 and these diverse understandings of cove- nant, I suggest, underlie certain classic disputes within traditional Jewish ethics. So, while covenant has provided an enduring theologi- cal context within which Jews traditionally have addressed ethical questions, it also has opened the door to numerous (and incompatible) understandings of the relationship between God and Israel, each with quite distinctive implications for Jewish ethics. Before proceeding to analyze Israel's covenantal relationship with God, it is important to be clear about the nature of what we are analyzing. I take it that for ancient Israelites (and for their Jewish and Christian successors, as well), "covenant" functions as a meta- phor for the relationship between the community and God. After all, in many respects this divine-human relationship is utterly unique, un- like any purely inter-human relationship. For one thing, since the divine party to the relationship is not knowable in the way another human is, God's qualities can be apprehended only indirectly. More- over, the radically unequal power of the divine and human partners to this relationship distinguishes it from any ordinary relationship be- tween individuals or groups of individuals. In particular, God, while a partner to the relationship, also retains the power to enforce its terms, to police and judge Israel's performance of its role within the 8.

Finally, this convenantal relationship is understood to obtain between God and future generations of Israelites, not yet born at the time the covenant was established. God, being eternal, has the ability to enter into a relationship which transcends the time limits of individual human lives, or even of whole generations. In this way too the relationship between God and Israel is incomparable to any other sort of relationship. Notwithstanding these obvious differences, it is precisely the bib- lical writers' (rather audacious) assumption that this relationship is much like an interpersonal human relationship. For the most part, God is conceived in largely anthropomorphic terms and the relation- ship that "He" has with "his people," like an interpersonal bond, in- volves complex emotional ties and mutual responsibilities. So too it undergoes the ebb and flow characteristic of all human relationships. Like bonds between people, this covenant between God and Israel does not arise in a vacuum, but rather within the context of a histori- cal relationship between God and this particular group of people be- ginning with its founder, Abraham. By the same token, once established the covenant shapes the subsequent historical relationship between the two parties, providing a certain stability and predictabil- ity to their interactions. To analyze the covenant between God and Israel, then, is to ask what sort of human relationship most closely approximates it and, concomitantly, how Israel understands the nature of its own religious- moral duties in the context of that sort of relationship. In Jewish tradition, as I hope to show, a variety of metaphors are employed to explicate the meaning of the covenant between God and Israel. Our task, as interpreters of this tradition, is to explore the ways in which each is suggestive and compelling, to indicate its limitations, and to sketch its implications for a theory of Jewish ethics. II. COVENANT AND CONTRACT: A TYPOLOGY OF RELATIONSHIPS The whole conception of the relationship between God and man is legal. God enters into a covenant with man whereby He contracts that in consideration of man performing certain stipulated duties He will bestow upon him certain rewards. The God of the Old Testament is essentially a lawgiver and a judge, and it is this aspect of the Deity that is constantly emphasized.10 10. LORD MACMILLAN, LAW AND OTHER THINGS 64 (1937). 92 [Vol. 9</page><page sequence="5">COVENANT AND CONTRACT Macmillan's view, that the covenant relationship is essentially contractual, is hardly a novel one. After all, characterizations of Old Testament religion as legalistic and of the Old Testament God as a stern judge are at least as old as the New Testament. In order to test the adequacy of this view, it is necessary first to explore briefly the nature of contractual relationships, at least as we understand them in the Anglo-American legal tradition. While it is notoriously difficult to define precisely the nature of a contract, all agree that it is a promise or set of promises enforceable at law.11 The elements of a contract which distinguish it from a non- enforceable promise are 1) mutual assent (offer and acceptance) and 2) some detriment on the part of the promisee (consideration) which that individual undertook in response to the promisor's offer and which the promisor sought to induce through the promise. Thus a contract is a bargain entered into freely by both parties, (at least) one of whom makes a promise in exchange for the other's doing or giving up something. Of course, contracts can be bilateral, such that both parties make promises to one another. But in any case a contract exists only when there is a "bargained-for-exchange." Understood in this way, there are several features of contractual relationships that deserve to be highlighted. First, individuals enter- ing into a contract act in a free, uncoerced manner. The creation of a contract, then, always implies that the parties could have elected to contract with others, or not at all. Second, contracts give rise to legal duties and corresponding rights that would not otherwise exist.12 The purpose of entering into a contract is to create a legal rela- tionship which generally will be enforceable by some legal sovereign.13 Finally, this legal relationship is self-contained. It does not depend for its validity on there being any extra-contractual relationship be- tween the parties at all. Of course, it often happens that parties to a contract (e.g., friends, spouses, etc.) have significant personal ties to one another, but the contractual relationship per se does not require 11. My analysis throughout this article utilizes a basic theory of contract, though one which is still current among legal scholars. I have not attempted to take into account the many subtle and complex variations among contracts. Many of these have arisen in response to our rapidly changing commercial climate and so have little if any applicability to the cove- nantal relationship between God and Israel. 12. As a practical matter, contracts sometimes include provisions that reiterate pre-ex- isting legal rights and duties. Still, the purpose of creating a contractual relationship is to establish the terms of a specific legal relationship that, apart from the contract, does not yet exist. 13. While it is true that certain types of contracts are void or voidable, the purpose of creating the contract is to establish a valid legal relationship which will be enforceable. 89] 93</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION or presuppose this. In this sense, a contract in itself creates a legal, as distinct from a personal, relationship. With this understanding of contract in hand, we turn now to ex- amine the nature of Israel's covenant with God. As we do so, it is important to delineate three distinct dimensions of that relationship and to consider them separately- 1) its origin, that is, how the covenant comes into being, 2) its scope, that is, the terms of the covenant, and 3) its duration, that is, whether the covenant is conditional or unconditional, revocable or irrevocable. In looking more closely at these dimensions of covenant we will dis- cover that, in each instance, the relationship may conform more or less closely to a legal contract. After exploring these aspects of cove- nant and the various ways in which each has been construed in Jewish tradition, I will take up the implications of this typology for Jewish ethics. 1. Origins Jewish tradition provides at least two different accounts of the origins of the covenant between God and Israel. The legalistic or con- tractual model of God's relationship with Israel can be seen most clearly in Exodus 19:5-6: "Now then, if you will obey Me faithfully and keep My covenant, you shall be My treasured possession among all the peoples. In- deed, all the earth is Mine, but you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel." And Moses came and summoned the elders of the people and put before them all the words that the Lord had commanded him. All the people answered as one, saying, "All that the Lord has spoken we will do." This passage surely depicts what we would identify as the formation of a contractual relationship. We find an exchange of promises which has been bargained for-God promises to bestow upon Israel certain benefits in consideration for Israel's promise to conduct itself in di- vinely sanctioned ways. God's offer is clearly made with the purpose of soliciting a response which, in turn, is given with the purpose of accepting that offer. We therefore have precisely the sort of bargain which, in our terms, establishes a legal contract. Both parties to the [Vol. 9 94</page><page sequence="7">COVENANT AND CONTRACT contract enter the relationship freely and of their own accord.14 The terms of the covenant presumably are those enumerated in the Deca- logue, which appears in the very next chapter and which Mendenhall long ago identified as following the accepted form of ancient Near Eastern treaties.15 But other sources describe the origins of the covenant quite dif- ferently. Consider the following passage from Deuteronomy 4:35-40: It has been clearly demonstrated to you that the Lord alone is God; there is none beside Him. From the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; on earth He let you see His great fire; and from amidst that fire you heard His words. And because He loved your fathers, He chose their offspring after them; He Him- self, in His great might, led you out of Egypt, to drive from your path nations greater and more populous than you, to take you into their land and give it to you as a heritage, as is still the case... Observe His laws and commandments, which I enjoin upon you this day, that it may go well with you and your children after you, and that you may long remain in the land that the Lord your God is giving you for all time. On this view, the covenantal relationship is not strictly a contractual one. It fails to be a contract precisely because there is here no bar- gain."6 God's mighty deeds on Israel's behalf constitute a gift given before the terms of the covenant were offered and accepted. It is therefore, at best, a kind of past consideration which cannot be in- voked in the formation of a later contract. Rather, the Israelites are morally indebted to God for redeeming them from slavery. Doing God's will, then, is a way, perhaps the only adequate way, for the Israelites to demonstrate their gratitude. This passage depicts the covenant relationship and the moral duties which it entails as arising in the context of a pre-existing relationship, established through God's acts of benevolence and Israel's experience of deliverance. This same point of view is reflected in the Mekhilta, an early rabbinic compilation of Scriptural exegeses (or midrash) on the book of Exodus: Why were the Ten Commandments not given at the beginning of the Torah? This may be compared to a person who came to a land and said to the inhabitants, "I will rule over you." The inhabitants 14. The fact that the Israelites enter this covenant freely is an especially salient feature of the covenant ceremony recorded in Nehemiah 10. 15. See Mendenhall, Covenant in 1 INTERPRETER'S DICTIONARY OF THE BIBLE (1962). 16. See E.A. FARNSWORTH, CONTRACTS 52 (1982) for a discussion of agreements which fail to be legally enforceable contracts in precisely this way. 89] 95</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION replied, "What have you done for us that you should rule over us?" Upon which the stranger built for them a wall, brought in water, led them in battle, and then said again, "I will rule over you." They replied, "Yes, yes." So, too, the Almighty liberated Israel from Egypt, split for them the sea, caused manna to fall, and brought forth water. Then He said to them, "I will rule over you." They answered, "Yes, yes."'7 These texts indicate that Israel's covenant with God is grounded in the gifts that God earlier bestowed and the corresponding benefits which Israel received. Whether God performed these acts on Israel's behalf in order to create a sense of obligation on their part matters little. The point is that Israel has an intimate relationship with God before the covenant between them is established. Thus, Israel's cove- nantal obligations arise in the context of a pre-existing personal and moral relationship with God. 2. Scope Turning to the second dimension of covenant, its "scope," we must examine the terms of the covenantal relationship itself. Specifi- cally, we want to know how broadly or narrowly these terms are to be construed. In the most general sense, of course, the terms of the cove- nant are contained in the Torah. The text of the Torah (literally, "in- struction") is God's revelation to Israel. The words of the Torah, therefore, contain the terms of this covenant-what God expects of Israel and what Israel may expect in turn of God. But the question remains: is the text of the Torah exhaustive or only suggestive? Does it specify Israel's covenantal duties fully or only minimally? Here again traditional Jewish sources suggest that covenant may signify 17. MEKHILTA TRACTATE BAHODESH, chapt. 5 on Exodus. A third, and quite radical, view of the origins of covenant emerges in another rabbinic passage (Sifre Num., Shelah § 115; Sifre Deut. Ekeb § 38): When God redeemed the children of Abraham, His friend, He redeemed them, not as children, but as slaves, so that if He imposed upon them decrees, and they obeyed not, He could say, "You are my slaves." When they went into the desert, He began to order them some light and some heavy commands .... They began to protest. Then God said, "You are my slaves. On this condition I redeemed you, that I should decree, and you shall fulfill." The same view is expressed more tersely and graphically in a passage from the Babylonian Talmud, (Shabbat 88a). In commenting on Exodus 19:17 that Israel stood "at the foot of the mountain" or literally, "under the mountain," the rabbis state that God held Mt. Sinai over them like a barrel and said, "If you accept my Torah, well and good, but if not, this shall be your burial ground." The authors of these passages imagined the covenantal relationship, not as contractual or even moral, but as purely coercive. God is the commanding sovereign, Israel the subservient slave. This view does not appear to be represented within the biblical corpus, however. 96 [Vol. 9</page><page sequence="9">COVENANT AND CONTRACT either a relationship which is strictly contractual or one which is more holistic and interpersonal. We find the terms of the covenant presented in a legalistic way in many passages throughout the Pentateuch. The language of Deuter- onomy 4:44-45 is typical: "This is the Teaching that Moses set before the Israelites: these are the exhortations, laws and the rules that Moses addressed to the people of Israel, after they had left Egypt." Similarly, Deuteronomy 28, which contains a lengthy list of blessings for those who "observe faithfully all God's commandments" together with a list of curses for those who do not, concludes with the words: "These are the terms of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to conclude with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb."'8 In this view, the Torah constitutes a written contract.'9 The terms of God's relationship with Israel are circumscribed, encompassed fully by the detailed laws found in Scripture.20 By contrast, the following passage from Deuteronomy 10:12-13 represents a more holistic view of covenant: And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God demand of you? Only this: to revere the Lord your God, to walk only in His paths, to love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and soul, keeping the Lord's commandments and laws, which I enjoin upon you today, for your good. On this view, observing the laws enumerated in the text is part, but only part, of what God demands. For one thing, those who scrupu- lously observe the law might nonetheless lack true reverence or love of God. The covenant demands not only that Israelites conform to a set regimen, but that inwardly they possess the proper attitude toward God. Moreover, loving and serving God wholeheartedly might take any number of forms. The specific laws which God enjoins, while indispensable, might be suggestive rather than exhaustive; a bare min- imum rather than a thorough compendium. From this perspective, it seems, the covenantal relationship is too fluid to be reduced to a legal formula.21 18. Deut. 28:69. 19. See FARNSWORTH, supra note 16, at 374 for a discussion of the Statute of Frauds which requires that certain types of contracts are enforceable only if written. 20. See also Deut. 7:9-11. 21. A similar perspective is reflected in W. S. Wurzburger's Covenantal Imperatives in Samuel K. Mirsky Memorial Volume: Studies in Jewish Law, Philosophy and Literature (1970). Wurzburger argues that at Sinai Israel experienced primarily a revelation of God's presence, and only secondarily of specific rules as the content of revelation. There are thus covenantal 89] 97</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION On occasion, we find these two positions articulated side by side in the same Scriptural passage. Consider, for instance, Deuteronomy 26:17-19: You have affirmed this day that the Lord is your God, that you will walk in his ways, that you will observe his laws and com- mandents and rules, and will obey Him. And the Lord has af- firmed this day that you are, as he has promised you, His treasured people which shall observe all his commandments, and that He will set you, in fame and renown and glory, high above all nations that He has made: and that you shall be, as He promised, a holy people to the Lord your God. On the one hand, the contractual, reciprocal character of the relation- ship is clearly reflected here. The emphasis is on the specific duties, spelled out in "laws, commandments and rules," which Israel promises to perform and on the specific benefits, "fame and renown and glory," which God promises to bestow in return. On the other hand, this relationship is, at least partly, open-ended, a matter not so much of observing specific rules as of "obeying God's voice." Insofar as this covenant between God and Israel is a legal con- tract, its demands are finite and reducible to writing. The text of To- rah spells out the terms of the relationship, and what is not stated explicitly can be inferred from its words. But insofar as the covenant is a holistic relationship it is, like all human relationships, dynamic. The demands that it makes cannot be fixed in advance or set in stone once and for all time. Israel's duties, from this perspective, are poten- tially infinite; they arise not from the text of Torah, or even from the interpretations of that text, but from living in relationship with God.22 When we read about "keeping God's laws, commandments and rules," we are in the realm of covenant as contract. When we read about "walking in God's ways" and "being a people holy to the Lord," we are in the realm of covenant as interpersonal relationship. These two views of covenant appear to co-exist within the tradition, albeit in tension with one another. 3. Duration The third dimension of covenant, its duration, concerns whether imperatives "which confront us with God's demands upon us in the here and now in all their uniqueness and particularity." Id. at 11. 22. This view, which is prevalent among Christian biblical scholars, tends to contrast the covenant, which is dynamic, with the law which is static. See, for example, D. MCCARTHY, TREATY AND COVENANT 175-76 (1963). [Vol. 9 98</page><page sequence="11">COVENANT AND CONTRACT this relationship between God and Israel is eternal or revokable. Quite obviously, Israel frequently violates God's law; indeed, the whole Hebrew Bible attests that the law was violated more consist- ently than it was observed. And it is equally clear that, under the terms of the covenant itself, Israel's transgressions will be met with divine sanctions, whether in the form of natural disasters or of con- quering foreign armies. But the question remains: Is it possible that Israel's transgressions could provoke God, not only to punish Israel under the terms of the covenant, but to revoke the covenant alto- gether? Could the covenantal bond be terminated entirely, or is it irrevocable? In fact, the possibility of terminating the covenant is first encoun- tered in the biblical narrative immediately following its formation, in response to Israel's worship of the Golden Calf. At that time, God threatens to destroy the people entirely, to found a new nation from Moses' descendants and to form a covenant with them.23 Only Moses' intervention on Israel's behalf saves them and their covenantal relationship with God. This same possibility emerges again in the first two chapters of Hosea when the prophet is told to take a harlot for a wife and have children. One of these is named "lo-ammi, [liter- ally, "not my people"] for you are not My people and I will not be your God."24 This represents a precise reversal of the covenantal formula, "I will be your God, and you shall be My people."25 The notion that God is prepared to sever the covenantal relationship alto- gether could hardly be expressed more succinctly. Insofar as God retains the right to revoke the covenant with Israel, whether or not God actually exercises that right, it could be said that the covenant more closely approximates a contractual rela- tionship. After all, contractual relationships are, by definition, condi- tional and so, if the conditions are not met (to any significant degree) they may legitimately be terminated. This legalistic model of cove- nant is perhaps reinforced by those biblical passages that describe Israel's transgressions as "breaches of contract" with God. The prophets in particular employed legal imagery to describe God's rela- tionship to Israel. We see this in Isaiah 3:14-15, "The Lord will bring this charge against the elders and officers of His people. . ." and again in Hosea 4:1, "Hear the word of the Lord, O people of Israel! For the Lord has a case against the inhabitants of his land ..." In response 23. Ex. 32-33. 24. Hosea 1:9. 25. Lev. 26:12. 89] 99</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION to this breach on Israel's part, God's only recourse is to suspend per- formance of God's own covenantal duties for a period of time.26 Before doing so, however, God invariably gives Israel adequate time to cure its breach, as befits the contractual nature of their relation- ship, through repentance and/or properly obedient behavior.27 In fact, it must be noted that nowhere in the Hebrew Bible or in subse- quent rabbinic literature do we find the assertion that God has in fact exercised the option of terminating the covenant in response to Israel's sinfulness. Nonetheless, the enduring possibility that this could happen is entirely consistent with a contractual view of the cov- enantal relationship. But scripture also presents the opposing view-that God's cove- nant is eternal and so, while it may be violated, it can never be termi- nated. This perspective is presented most powerfully in the words of God's covenant with Abraham, "I will maintain My covenant be- tween Me and you, and your offspring to come, as an everlasting cov- enant throughout the ages, to be God to you and to your offspring to come."28 The covenant guarantees that God's love for Israel is eter- nal; nothing Israel does, however grievous, can sever that bond.29 God may be displeased with Israel and chastise them severely, but the bond between them is unbreakable. This is expressed with particular poignancy in Isaiah 54:7-10: For a little while I forsook you, but with vast love I will bring you back. In slight anger, for a moment, I hid My face from you; but with kindness everlasting I will take you back in love - said the Lord your Redeemer .... For the mountains may move and the 26. In the nature of the case, God cannot utilize either of the classic remedies for breach of legal contract, that is, monetary damages or specific performance. There is, of course, no monetary value that could be assigned to the protection and care which God promises to bestow upon Israel, nor to the costs which God incurs in withdrawing that protection. Nor, of course, is there any way for God to force Israel to comply with the terms of the covenant, short of turning them into automatons. 27. For a discussion of curing breaches of contract, see FARNSWORTH, supra note 16, at 613-18. 28. Gen. 17:7. 29. This unconditional view of covenant is often identified with the Abrahamic or Davidic covenants, while the Sinaitic covenant, by contrast, is supposed to be conditional. See, for example, J. BRIGHT, COVENANT AND PROMISE: THE PROPHETIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUTURE IN PRE-EXILIC ISRAEL 23-44 (1976); also, Levenson, The Jerusalem Temple in Devo- tional and Visionary Experience, in 1 JEWISH SPIRITUALITY 48-51 (A. Green ed. 1986). Yet, insofar as the Sinaitic covenant is, from the perspective of the Torah's redactors, built upon the covenant with Abraham and extended (perhaps fulfilled) through the covenant with David, the dichotomy should not be maintained too sharply. Indeed, the Sinaitic covenant itself is, from one perspective, contractual and conditional and from another perspective, eternal and unconditional. 100 [Vol. 9</page><page sequence="13">COVENANT AND CONTRACT hills be shaken, but my loyalty shall never move from you, nor My covenant of friendship be shaken - said the Lord, who takes you back in love. Israel's violations of the covenant have angered God, who has meted out the appropriate punishment and yet, according to Isaiah, the cov- enant itself remains intact. This perspective is reinforced by all those passages that utilize the metaphor of the parent-child relationship to describe the cove- nant, such as Jeremiah 31:36-37: If these laws should ever be annulled by Me-declares the Lord- only then would the offspring of Israel cease to be a nation before Me for all time. Thus said the Lord: If the heavens above could be measured, and the foundations of the earth below could be fathomed, only then would I reject all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done-declares the Lord. And on the verse earlier in the same chapter (Jeremiah 31:3) which refers to God's "eternal love" for Israel, the rabbis comment: "It does not say, 'with abounding love,' but 'with eternal love.' For you might think the love with which God loves Israel was for three years or two years or a hundred years. But it was a love for everlasting and to all eternity."30 III. COVENANT THEOLOGIES AND JEWISH ETHICS Myth is less likely to dictate specific moral directives than it is to inscribe the general-and normative-contours for moral life. It can point to the nature and locus of the good, to the cosmic con- text of moral behavior, to the nature of moral agency, and to the significance of moral community. At the same time, the myth may indicate the threats to the moral life as well as the consequences of immoral conduct.31 To this point I have suggested first, that the concept of covenant is complex, consisting of several dimensions which I have called ori- gin, scope, and duration; second, that there are several views of cove- nant within Jewish tradition; and finally, that these views can be analyzed in terms of the extent to which they conform to a contrac- tual or legal model. I want now to sketch some of the implications of these possibilities for issues in Jewish ethics. In accordance with 30. TANNA D'BEI ELIYAHU, p. 31 as quoted in C. G. MONTEFIORE AND H. LOEWE, A RABBINIC ANTHOLOGY 63 (1974). 31.

What follows is merely suggestive and by no means exhausts the ways in which diverse covenant theologies can and do shape Jewish ethical thinking.32 1. Origins The way in which we imagine the origins of covenant has far- reaching implications for Jewish ethics. Recall that there were two models for the origins of the covenant: one in which God and Israel freely choose to enter into a contractual relationship, and another in which Israel agrees to the covenant as an act of gratitude for God's benevolence. At stake here is the extent to which Jewish ethics is autonomous. If we think of the covenant as contractual, then Israel has knowingly accepted the obligations and privileges pertaining to this relationship. And their moral duties (indeed, all their religious duties) arise autonomously, at least in the sense that the basis of these obligations rests in an act of their own free will. Of course, this model of covenant accords nicely with the liberal tradition in political and ethical theory, and so has had broad appeal since the Enlightenment. This perspective on covenant has been particularly attractive to those moder Jewish thinkers, such as Hermann Cohen and Emil Fack- enheim, who have attempted to assimilate Jewish ethics into a Kant- ian framework. Commenting on the freedom which Israel has in responding to God's offer, Fackenheim writes: The freedom required in the pristine moment of the divine com- manding Presence, then, is nothing less than the freedom to accept or reject the divine commanding Presence as a whole, andfor its own sake-that is, for no other reason than that it is that Presence. It is such freedom that the prophet displays when he responds, "Here I am, send me"; or the people as a whole, when they respond, "we shall do and hearken."33 Fackenheim acknowledges that this is not full autonomy in the Kant- ian sense, for moral duty arises in the context of a choice which God 32. While I have tried to provide concrete examples of texts and thinkers that exemplify each of the tendencies I identify, I would argue that each of these options exists within the tradition, whether or not they have all been consciously articulated and developed historically. My point, then, is to spell out the range of possibilities for a covenantal ethic in Judaism, while recognizing that it may not be possible in each instance to demonstrate explicit connections between a specific model of covenant and the ethical theory of a specific thinker. 33. Fackenheim, The Revealed Morality of Judaism and Modern Thought, in THE JEWISH THOUGHT OF EMIL FACKENHEIM 78 (1987). 102 [Vol. 9</page><page sequence="15">COVENANT AND CONTRACT imposes by offering the covenant to Israel. Yet, Israel's response to this offer is genuinely free, not imposed upon it. If the covenant is contractual in origin, then the duties to which it gives rise are autono- mous in nature. If, on the other hand, we conceive of the covenant as arising out of Israel's gratitude for God's prior acts of salvation and protection, then covenant is grounded in a kind of pre-existing moral duty.34 The moral duty to express gratitude to one's benefactor would appear to be the basis of all legal duties arising under the covenant. As Shubert Spero, a contemporary Jewish ethicist, has put it, "Logically speak- ing, it is not the case that I do what is right because this is obedience to God but rather I obey God because it is right to do so."35 On this view, Israel possesses a limited moral freedom; it is the freedom to choose whether or not to fulfill their moral duty. But they cannot escape a fundamental moral duty to God, on which the covenant rela- tionship is based. That option has been taken out of their hands, as it were, by God's actions on their behalf in the past. As Jon Levenson writes: Because the Abrahamic Covenant is the basis and motivation for the redemption from Egypt, and because the redemption from Egypt is the basis of the Sinaitic Covenant, Israel at Sinai is [sic: in] no position to decline. The language of free choice notwithstand- ing, to decline at this point would be an unpardonable act of ingratitude.36 Israel's covenantal obligations, then, are imposed by God as a mea- sure of what Israel owes for its deliverance from slavery.37 But diverse views of the covenant's origins will shape not only the ground of Israel's moral life, but the very content of its obligations 34. On this analysis, Israel's obligation to observe ritual laws would likewise be a moral duty. 35. S. SPERO, MORALITY, HALAKHA AND THE JEWISH TRADITION 82 (1983). 36. J. LEVENSON, CREATION AND THE PERSISTENCE OF EVIL: THE JEWISH DRAMA OF DIVINE OMNIPOTENCE 143 (1988). Levenson argues that there is a dialectical relationship between autonomy and heteronomy in the Sinaitic covenant, which mirrors the political rela- tionship between the suzerain and vassal in those ancient Near Eastern treaties on which cove- nant is modeled. 37. The contrast between these two models also finds expression in the diverse motiva- tions offered for performance of the divine law. In a contractual model, Israel's primary moti- vations for observing the law will be 1) the duty to fulfill its own promise, and 2) the rewards and punishments that accompany performance and breach respectively. In the alternative, Israel's motivations will be largely feelings of gratitude and love engendered by God's benevo- lence.

ROSETT, A LIVING TREE: THE ROOTS AND GROWTH OF JEWISH LAW 93- 109 (1988). 89] 103</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION as well. The contractual model of covenant emphasizes mutuality and partnership between the parties. It establishes, as Martin Buber and others have noted, a dialogical relationship. In the context of such a relationship, the value of the human partner is affirmed. In- deed, if the covenant is a kind of contractual bargain, then it can be said that God needs Israel every bit as much as Israel needs God. The logical consequence of this is a kind of social activism which stresses that Israel's role is, as the traditional liturgy says, "to perfect the world for the kingdom of heaven." From this perspective Israel's so- cial and political institutions will be seen as playing a positive, indeed a necessary, role in the service of God and in the fulfillment of the covenant. By contrast, a covenant that is imposed by God on Israel stresses the fundamental inequality between the parties. God is active, work- ing in history, guiding the destiny of nations, and revealing the way to moral perfection. Israel, for its part, can only passively accept the truths as they are revealed. Its role is to submit humbly to the divine decrees, grateful for the opportunity to serve the highest master. This passivity is highlighted in the biblical narratives of the exodus and conquest which stress God's power and majesty contrasted with Israel's passivity. Such a perspective can lead to a profound moral quietism, and the corresponding conviction that all is in God's hands. It can also radically affect the significance attributed to Israel's social and political institutions. Like all human endeavors, these will be radically devalued. At times they may even come to be viewed as obstacles to the fulfillment of God's will on earth. As Richard Ru- benstein says: Israel's ancient covenant with Yahweh was an attempt to create just such an alternative to the state's claim to ultimacy. By posit- ing a God who possessed neither human image nor human incar- nation as the power to whom the community owed its fundamental fidelity, the covenant had the effect of rejecting both the doctrine and the institutions that affirmed the ultimacy of the political order.38 Some have argued that there is, within covenant theology, a dia- lectic between heteronomy and autonomy, between power and part- nership. The most extensive development of these themes to date is in David Hartman's masterful work, A Living Covenant: The Innovative 38.

Neusner ed. 1983). 104 [Vol. 9</page><page sequence="17">COVENANT AND CONTRACT Spirit in Traditional Judaism.39 Such an approach has the merit of preserving the complexities of the covenant concept and of acknowl- edging the historical variations that have developed on the theme. But for those who stand within the tradition and wish to live their moral life in the context of this covenant, choices will have to be made. At the very least, religious thinkers committed to clarifying the foundation and nature of their own covenantal obligations will be forced to give precedence to one or another of the options available within the tradition. Indeed, Hartman expresses his preference for the model of covenant that stresses mutuality and partnership, and a good deal of the book is devoted to defending this choice. The point is simply that. in theory, one can accept the unresolved quality of the dialectic between different interpretations of covenant. When the time comes to act morally in the world, however, a commitment to one model or another must be made, if only implicitly. 2. Scope Diverse views of the covenant's scope lead to different conclu- sions about the relationship between law and ethics in Judaism. The question for Jewish ethicists has often been phrased in terms of the role, if any, that independent ethical judgments play in the develop- ment of Jewish law. Some contemporary Jewish ethicists, like Robert Gordis40 and Elliot Dorff,41 have argued that the rabbis consciously interpreted (indeed, even misconstrued) received biblical laws so as to bring them in line with their own moral norms. Indeed, it is claimed that the genius of rabbinic Judaism lay precisely in its ability to mod- ify existing laws to meet the demands of justice as they understood it. Other scholars, like David Weiss Halivni,42 have suggested that noth- ing of the sort ever happened. Indeed, it could not have happened because the rabbis were committed to the view that there could be no valid moral judgments outside the sphere of the law. To suggest otherwise, according to Halivni, is to claim that divine laws as they stand could be immoral, and this is clearly impossible. The dispute among these scholars turns on the way we under- stand the rabbinic interpretations of certain biblical rules. The best 39.

Chiel ed. 1978). 89] 105</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION known examples include the rabbinic interpretation of the famous lex talionis, "an eye for an eye," which the rabbis understood to mandate, not retribution, but monetary compensation equal to "the value of an eye, the value of a tooth," and so forth. In another instance, involving the rule that in the Sabbatical year all creditors had to cancel the debts owed them,43 the sage Hillel ingeniously restricted the applica- tion of the law to actions taken by the creditors themselves. Accord- ingly, he invented a legal fiction, known as a prosbul, by means of which a court could collect a debt on the creditor's behalf, which did not technically violate the Scriptural rule. At the same time, it made it possible for those in need of money to get loans in the years immedi- ately preceding the Sabbatical, which (understandably) creditors were otherwise very reluctant to give. In still another example, the rabbis effectively eliminated capital punishment (though, of course, the Bible mandates it) by introducing extraordinarily stringent conditions which had to be met before a person could be convicted of a capital offense.44 Since these conditions could never be met, no one could be convicted of a capital offense and the death sentence could not be carried out. Yet, how one understands these rabbinic developments, and so too the relationship of ethics and law within the tradition, depends entirely on which model of covenant one attributes to them. Some, like Gordis and Dorff, ascribe to the rabbis the view that covenant is a holistic, ever-changing relationship. In this view of covenant, the re- lationship is primary and the legal content is secondary. Because they attribute to the rabbis this perspective on covenant, they read the sources as evidence of a tension between the demands of the law and the demands of the covenantal relationship. For, from this theologi- cal perspective, it is inevitable that there be conflicts between the re- ceived legal rules and what our covenantal relationship with God demands of us, between Jewish law and Jewish ethics. And it is equally inevitable that, when these conflicts occur, they be resolved in favor of ethics. The contractual view of covenant, adopted by Halivni, leads to precisely the opposite conclusion. As he reads the tradition, the cove- nant is the law, and so fulfilling the covenant means nothing more and 43. Deut. 15:1-2. 44. For example, two separate witnesses had to provide identical accounts of the crime, and of the most minute details of the circumstances surrounding the crime, that they had to have warned the murderer of the consequences of this act immediately before it was per- formed, that they had to ascertain that that murderer was definitely of sound mind, etc. 106 [Vol. 9</page><page sequence="19">COVENANT AND CONTRACT nothing less than fulfilling the terms of the written contract. Thus, there can be no conflict between law and ethics, for, after all, this law is divine and so, by definition, perfect. From this theological perspec- tive, if any established law ever appears less than perfect, the only conceivable conclusion is that we have not understood it properly. Any apparent conflict between law and ethics is just that-apparent, not real-for God cannot have meant for us to apply a revealed law in a way which is blatantly unjust or unethical. In Judaism, law and ethics are one and the same.45 But the extent to which the scope of covenant is understood le- gally will also affect Jewish ethical reasoning. Those who affirm a more contractual model of covenant will be inclined to adopt a for- malist approach to constructing moral arguments. If the covenant is a legal document, it must be interpreted accordingly. Legal reasoning emphasizes the creation and application of rules and principles, the search for precedents, and the use of analogies. It strives for consis- tency, predictability, and logical coherence. It will also give rise to legal codes containing systematic expositions of the law applicable within each sphere of life. As Elliot Dorff has written, "The Cove- nant model, however, provides the basis for Jewish legal development, for God not only commands but enters into a legal relationship through the Covenant. Therefore such legal techniques as interpreta- tion, usage, recourse to course of dealings became appropriate legal techniques to give meaning to the parties' original relationship."46 Of course, Jewish authorities over the centuries have produced a volumi- nous and complex legal literature precisely because they have under- stood the covenant and its terms as fundamentally legal. But the contrasting model of the covenant has also played a role in Jewish ethics.47 Those who have understood the scope of the cove- nant in more holistic terms have adopted a less formalistic and sys- tematic approach to moral reasoning. They have placed less emphasis on interpreting the words of the text (whether biblical or rabbinic) than on intuiting and appropriating the spirit of divine instruction. 45.

Dorff, Covenant: The Transcendent Thrust in Jewish Law, in 7 THE JEWISH LAW ANNUAL 79 (1988). 47. For a discussion of these two models of ethical reasoning, see Ellenson, How to Draw Guidance from a Heritage: Jewish Approaches to Mortal Choices, in A TIME TO BE BORN AND A TIME TO DIE (B. Kugan, ed. 1991). Ellenson identifies the former approach as "legal for- malism," and the latter as "covenantal," but I have tried to argue that each is really covenantal in its own way. 89] 107</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION Their ethical reflections have not proceeded case by case, or principle by principle, but rather in a more homiletical vein. They focus less on defining a uniform system of ethical behavior than on exploring the inner motivations and intentionality that is expressed through moral acts and which, for them, is the essence of the moral life. Through the use of stories and the examples of pious individuals, these ethicists have sought to inspire a kind of moral life that cannot be defined by adherence to rules alone. Because they understand the covenantal re- lationship between God and Israel in more interpersonal terms, their style of moral reasoning is fluid and suggestive, rather than concrete and definitive. This sort of pietistic moral literature was especially popular in the medieval period, the best known example being Bachya ibn Pakuda's Duties of the Heart. But it was revitalized in the musar movement and in Hasidic circles. It continues to exert an influence on modern Jewish thinkers like Martin Buber and, more recently, Eu- gene Borowitz, who writes of his own brand of liberal Jewish ethics that it consists less in obedient observance than in authentically living in Covenant.48 3. Duration Finally, we come to the third dimension of covenant, its dura- tion. One's understanding of covenant as either revocable or irrevoca- ble will have profound implications for the way one understands the significance of Israel's moral life and especially its connection to es- chatology. If the covenant with Israel is, even theoretically, subject to termination, then it can be said that Israel, through its deeds, has the power to undo what God has done. While God may have initiated the covenant, once established it can be revoked by either party. Each transgression of the moral law, on this view, pushes Israel closer to the brink and, conversely, each righteous deed brings Israel closer to the ultimate messianic redemption. Israel, then, is in control of its own destiny. Its moral behavior has literally cosmic reverberations. On this view, Israel's ultimate fate in history, and in a sense God's fate in this world, depends upon its deeds alone. This position re- ceives its classic articulation in the rabbinic comment on Isaiah 43:12 "'You are my witnesses, says the Lord, and I am God.' That is, when you are my witnesses, I am God, and when you are not my witnesses, I am, as it were, not God."49 48. E. BOROWITZ, EXPLORING JEWISH ETHICS 184 (1990). 49. MIDRASH, PSALMS on 123:1. 108 [Vol. 9</page><page sequence="21">COVENANT AND CONTRACT On the other hand, if the covenant is irrevocable, then Israel's responsibility is much diminished and so too is the power of its ethical deeds. Just as Israel could not initiate the covenant, so too it is pow- erless to dissolve it. God's hand in history cannot be forced. No righteous acts can destroy Israel, but then neither can they bring the messianic redemption. So, while the people can still expect to be blessed by God for their obedience and punished for their transgres- sions, this drama is played out in the context of a script whose conclu- sion is not in doubt. This position receives its classical rabbinic formulation in the statement that "Israel, even though it sins, remains Israel."50 Somewhat ironically, given this model of covenant, Israel's place in history is more secure, but only because it depends less on its own deeds.51 The very same dichotomy can be expressed in terms of whether Israel's holiness as a nation is inherent and permanent or acquired and conditional. On the first view, Israel's very status as God's cho- sen people hangs in the balance, as it were, for the people live with the awareness that they could one day be rejected and another people chosen in their place. Israel's holiness as a people is conditional; it is not bestowed as a gift, but rather must be continually reaffirmed and realized through Israel's own obedience to God's law. The contrast- ing view represents Israel's status as God's chosen people as fixed and secure. On this view, Israel's holiness is given once and for all time with the revelation on Mt. Sinai.52 The people are holy by virtue of their unique history; their sole task is to live out the meaning of that mandate. The former position is oriented toward the future, which is uncertain, the latter is oriented toward the past which is sure. The language of the blessing traditionally recited before performing a bib- lical commandment reflects this ambiguity: "Blessed are you, Lord our God, who has sanctified us through your commandments and commanded us to. ... " In one sense, Israel has been sanctified al- ready through the giving of the commandments. But in another sense the point is that receiving the law only made Israel potentially holy. They must forever make this holiness actual and effective through the performance of those commandments each and every time they act in 50. Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 44a. 51. See Schwartzchild, On the Theology of Jewish Survival, in JUDAISM AND ETHICS 291- 302 (D. Silver ed. 1970), who notes that both these views exist within the tradition in dialecti- cal tension with one another. 52. The most famous exponent of this view was the medieval Jewish philosopher, Judah Halevi, who claims in his Kuzari that Jews are inherently superior to others. A similar view, expounded in a mystical context, was held by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. 89] 109</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION accordance with God's will.53 IV. CONCLUSIONS Israel's theology was "historically-conditioned theology," which means covenant-centered theology. God was thought to be a covenant-making, covenant-restoring, and covenant-fulfilling God; Israel a people of the covenant and a covenant-breaking people.54 These reflections on the nature of covenant and its shaping of Jewish ethics lead in a number of directions. Minimally they suggest that secular legal concepts can provide valuable tools for the analysis of ethics in the Jewish tradition. Even a rudimentary appreciation of principles of contract law can help us refine our understanding of models of covenant and see what the implications of these differing models would be. More importantly, the typology of covenant models developed here should challenge certain prevalent assumptions about the mean- ing of that term in the Western religious tradition. It is still widely assumed that the Jewish model of covenant is largely legalistic, espe- cially by comparison to the Christian model. Indeed, this dichotomy has emerged again recently in the work of a Jewish ethicist, Michael Goldberg, who juxtaposes the Jewish covenant, marked by obligations and mutual partnership, with the Christian covenant, characterized by unbounded grace.55 But clearly covenant bears a range of mean- ings in Jewish tradition (and, no doubt, in Christian tradition as well) which are far richer and more subtle than Goldberg and others have tended to assume. And, having recognized the diversity of possibilities inherent in the covenant idea, we would do well to reconsider the suggestions made recently by those both in law and in religion to appropriate cov- enant into our own legal system. Robin Lovin, for example, has pro- posed that a covenantal model of justice could serve as a valuable corrective to the prevailing secular models of political legitimacy in our society. He writes, "A covenantal paradigm of legitimacy, far 53. NICHOLSON, supra note 9, at 191-217, discerns a development within the biblical sources from an early view of covenant as a natural, familial sort of relationship which is permanent to a later view according to which the relationship is more distant and conditional. Concomitantly, Scripture presents Israel's holiness as both "indicative" and "imperative," as both a fact and a goal. 54. Ramsey, Elements of a Biblical Political Theory, 29 J. RELIGION 258 (1949). 55. M.

As we have seen, there are, within Jewish tradition at least, some models of covenant which are quite legalistic and so might reinforce rather than correct the shortcomings of a social contract theory of political legitimacy. By the same token, some models of covenant lead in directions which we would find deeply troubling and almost certainly incompatible with deeply rooted convictions about moral autonomy. Covenant is not one thing, but several. Only when this fact is fully appreciated can we fruitfully consider how we might appropriate covenant into our political and legal thinking, and in what ways it might be useful to do so. To scholars of biblical theology and/or Jewish ethics, I would suggest that the term "covenant" requires greater conceptual clarifi- cation than it has generally received. Hartman, for example, has dili- gently investigated the diverse meanings of covenant, but he too has tended to conflate what are in fact distinct sets of dichotomies. He moves too quickly from conditional vs. unconditional covenants to a discussion of formalistic vs. dynamic forces within the tradition.57 But, as I have tried to show, there are several dimensions of covenant, each of which can be understood in a more or less contractual way, and each of which functions to some extent independently. Though I have not attempted to sort out the possible permutations, it is at least theoretically possible that one could adopt, for example, a contractual view of the origins of covenant, but a more holistic view of its scope, and so forth. This being the case, when discussing the nature of di- verse covenants one must carefully attend both to the distinct levels on which it functions and to the diverse forms it can take. Above all, this study has served to highlight the power and per- sistence of covenant as the dominant metaphor for Israel's relation- ship to God, both in Scripture and in the subsequent rabbinic tradition that builds upon that foundation. The fact that covenant has proved an enduring vehicle for symbolizing Israel's religious life testifies to its ability to express the inexpressible, namely, the mystery of God's election of this people as well as the enormous and bewilder- 56.

From its origins as a political concept rooted in ancient Near Eastern treaty formation, covenant comes to embody a unique and multi-fac- eted relationship between Israel and its God. That God-depicted sometimes as sovereign ruler, other times as lover, still other times as parent-remains throughout a God bound by a covenantal relation- ship to Israel. Covenant proved capable of generating a conceptual framework stable enough to endure the vicissitudes of Israel's history, but also elastic enough to support a remarkable range of ethical and political philosophies. Each of the meanings inherent in the notion of covenant has its appeal and its limitations. But even if some appear more prevalent than others, all are firmly rooted in Jewish tradition. Each understanding of covenant remains a perennial option, provid- ing a rich resource for ethical reflection, as Israel continues its strug- gle to discern the infinite within the finite, to bring the divine within the realm of the human.</page></plain_text>
