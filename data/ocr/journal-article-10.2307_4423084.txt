<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE KENDRICK'S CAVE MANDIBLE P RE H I ST O RI C decorative art in Great Britain is rare before the Bronze Age. One of the most important among the handful of pieces known from before this period is the decorated horse mandible fragment from Kendrick's Cave, Llandudno. Yet this piece and the site of its discovery are virtually unknown. Published in 188o, the mandible was lost to sight between 1885 and its acquisition by the British Museum in 1959, and other important finds from the excavation in which it was discovered have gone unrecorded. The circum- stances of the excavation, the subsequent history of the collection from Kendrick's Cave, and the cultural affinities of the decorated horse mandible are the subjects of the present paper. The investigation of Kendrick's Cave Kendrick's Cave is a small natural cavern on the south side of the Great Orme (or Great Orme's head), a limestone massif on the seaward side of Llandudno, North Wales (O.S. Ref. SH 78008284). The entrance to the cave lies close to and immediately above the Tygwyn road, in the garden of Ardwy Orme (Fig. I), the residence of the late Dr. G. A. Humphreys. The site is described by the Royal Commission as Monument 365 in the Caernarvonshire Inventory-a natural cavern about 50 ft. deep and 16 ft. wide at the entrance, at about 200 ft. O.D. The first published description is in the combined papers by Eskrigge and Boyd Dawkins ( 8 8o). Eskrigge makes it quite clear that the discovery of antiquities in the cave was accidental and had only just taken place. The cavern had 'for many years been occupied by Mr. Kendrick, the lapidary. Some weeks since desiring to enlarge his accommodation he commenced excavation further back into the mountain.' Eskrigge continues with a description of the stratigraphy and the archaeological relics recorded in the course of this enlargement, to which is appended a footnote dated 5 August (18 8o), stating 'further excavations have since been made'. An independent description of some of the archaeological finds by Canon Ingram, published in 1885, describes the cave as having 'been in the gradual process of excavation by a person called Kendrick' and 'recom- mends that further researches seem most desirable, as they might settle any doubts which may have arisen as to the accuracy of the present explorer's state- ment, on which the truth of the discovery of the above mentioned remains in that particular cave rests'. The Shrewsbury Chronicle for 24 September 18 8o, which contains a summary of the Boyd Dawkins report, states that the finds 'might probably have been consigned to the debris from which they had been 230</page><page sequence="2">removed had it not been for a medical gentleman of Bangor, who recognised in them the remains of human beings and the work of human hands'. It seems clear that Kendrick had little education,I and at first took little interest in his discoveries. When these appeared to be of scientific importance he placed them at the disposal of Mr. Eskrigge for scientific examination, retaining their t ?it 2:; ?t 69 68 C 405 M. 4 09--- 3-5?1907 jf~'P ~ 8 A* 0 0 11 " *Z- . r" '~?? i Ft~CJ ~ P -96? ?i9~~C,~ T~Pi~ ~P ~paiD Q.c?~~:~ .?l ?Ii?

Eskrigge's statement of the stratigraphy is quite clear and appears to be accurate in general terms. He recognized a basal cave earth or clay, which Kendrick had penetrated to the depth of 2-3 ft., surmounted by 4-6 ft. of loosely cemented breccia made up of angular limestone blocks, and succeeded 231</page><page sequence="3">in places by a layer of stalagmite. It is this breccia or 'limestone rubble' which contained the archaeological finds, and also some apparent burials of human skeletons. The cave earth contained bones identified by Boyd Dawkins as bison, said to be 'in a different mineral condition from the rest of the bones, and broken to extract the marrow'. These are said to be Pleistocene in date. The succeeding breccia contained, at a level thought to be approximately I ft. above the clay, portions of four human skeletons, two portions of horse mandibles (one decor- ated), two upper canine teeth of brown bear decorated and perforated for sus- pension, and at a point 2-3 ft. above the human skeletons were further animal remains including horse, sheep, and ox. Dawkins regarded the skeletons as burials and the archaeological relics as associated grave goods, which he would assign to the Neolithic period on anatomical grounds, and in contradistinction to the earlier Pleistocene remains in the cave earth. 'The general impression left in my mind by the whole series of remains is that the interment is of Neolithic age and that the cave was used as a sepulchral vault by a family of small Iberic cave dwellers in the neighbourhood.' We have no evidence at the present time of the nature of the deposits as the cave has been much altered since the excavation, and all traces of breccia and cave earth appear to be lacking.4 Modern opinion would certainly not support Dawkins's confident argument, nor does it seem necessary to assume that the contents of a deposit 4-6 ft. in thickness are all of the same date. In view of the lack of evidence for properly associated finds, the discoveries from Kendrick's Cave have to be treated on their own merits. Archaeological specimens from the cave It appears that when the remains from the cave then in possession of his rela- tives were purchased by the committee of the Llandudno public library, after the death of Thomas Kendrick, they were 'not as complete as when submitted to Professor Boyd Dawkins'.s Some of the most important pieces had already been dispersed to private collectors. Some human remains and a few unworked animal bones are now in the Llandudno public library, as are a small series of incised bones possibly of sheep or deer, stained with haematite, believed to be from this cave but unlabelled and not mentioned in any contemporary account. Certain of the collections dispersed by Kendrick have turned up on the market in recent years. A small polished stone axe-head of typical British Neolithic type bearing the label, Kendricks Cave, Llandudno, was presented to the British Museum in 1956 by Mr. Weinreb the London bookseller, into whose hands it had come with a miscellaneous collection. The following year a further group of antiquities, all labelled as from the same source, were brought to the Museum for examination by Mr. J. R. Wright, a young collector in Worcester, who had purchased them from a dealer in that locality. This collection, which included 232</page><page sequence="4">the decorated jawbone fragment, and a number of previously unpublished pieces, were purchased by the Christy Trustees from Mr. Wright in 1959. Among the outstanding specimens mentioned in the contemporary reports are two bear's teeth, and a further group of 'swine' teeth, decorated with trans- verse cut marks and perforated for suspension as part of a necklace. Both these groups appear to have passed through the local dealers' hands in the I930s. The two bear's teeth are thought to be referred to in the entry 'Part of a necklace of bear's claws of prehistoric type'-in a catalogue of a sale at Glynllifon, Caernar- vonshire6 in 1932, located by the Royal Commission. The catalogue unfor- tunately gave no indication of the provenance of these pieces, and their present whereabouts are unknown. It seems likely that they will turn up on the market in the future, when they may be identifiable from the illustration published by Boyd Dawkins. A collection of nine bovid and deer teeth, decorated and perforated in the appropriate manner, but again unlabelled, were acquired by Mrs. Dowler of Penrhyn Bay as part of a local purchase of prehistoric antiquities at approxi- mately the same period, and were presented by her in 1964 to the Rh6s-on- Sea Museum, Colwyn Bay, North Wales. There is reason to believe on internal evidence, and on general grounds, that these are the 'swine teeth' from Kendricks Cave. They have been lent to the British Museum for examination, and are described here by kind permission of the Rh6s-on-Sea Museum. Miscellaneous pieces In addition to the important finds mentioned by the contemporary accounts, the Museum collections include the following specimens labelled as from Kendrick's Cave, and belonging to various periods between the Neolithic and the Roman occupation.

Reg. no. 1959, I2-3, 4. The specimen is made on a flat piece of stone flaked on both sides in a disc form, flat on one side and convex on the other, but with a typical balanced axe-blade termination made from two converging polished surfaces. Though it is formally in the axe clan, Mr. Houlder regards these pieces as allied to knives, and has published 233 Hh</page><page sequence="5">FIG. 2. Kendrick's Cave, Llandudno: I. Bone comb. z.

Length i55 mm. (Fig. 2. ), B.M. Reg. no. 1959, 12-3, 2- This is plainly a variety of the long-lived Early Iron Age type, appearing notably at All Cannings Cross, Maiden Castle, and at Glastonbury and Meare Lake Villages.9 The comb is of importance here, as it has been used to give a compara- tive dating to the decorated horse mandible from the same site (see Appendix I). There is also a series of six fragments of animal bones, including two with articular ends with lengths 70 mm., 71 mm., respectively, probably metacarpals of sheep or deer,'0 incised with a number of separate lines or groups of lines and showing traces of haematite staining (Fig. 3). These are now in the collec- tions of Llandudno Public Library, and are kept in a case with the animal and human bones from Kendrick's Cave. Though they are not labelled, or mentioned in any contemporary publication, they have been preserved at Llandudno with the antiquities from the cave and are generally accepted as such. It has not proved possible to obtain an identification of the animal bones, which may be deer or goat, but are most likely to be sheep. The incisions appear to be some form of tally mark, but do not closely resemble the well-known Palaeolithic bone tallies or Marques de Chasse from France," or the similar objects found in the Mesolithic period in Denmark. Nor do they resemble published Medieval examples. It has not been found possible to find any close parallels for these incised bones, and it may be that they are of modern manufacture. If they are accepted as genuine, and the bones prove to be of sheep, then they are likely to belong to a period later than the Neolithic. Nitrogen analysis would show the age of the bones (as distinct from the incisions) relative to the Iron Age bone comb found on the same site (see Appendix I). The decorated teeth The teeth in the Dowler collection at Rh6s-on-Sea Museuml2 illustrated here (Fig. 4) are thought to come from Kendrick's Cave since they are described in two independent contemporary publications in 188o and 1885. Eskrigge writes (188 0): August 5th. Further excavations have been made resulting in the discovery ... (of) ... a number of small teeth with holes drilled through them, probably used as a necklace. 235</page><page sequence="7">FIG. 3. Kendrick's Cave, Llandudno. Incised deer or sheep bones.

Atypical Though the teeth are of bovid and deer, they bear some resemblance to swine teeth, and it is evident, from the contemporary accounts, that the Kendrick's Cave teeth were never examined by a specialist. But the real significance of this quotation lies in the description of the decoration. Eight of the nine teeth, here illustrated from the Dowler collection, are decorated precisely in the manner that Ingram describes, and though 'from four to six' transverse lines is not accurate for all the teeth, it is the general impression given by the teeth as a whole. In addition to this decoration, each illustrated tooth is perforated in the extremity of the 'fang', rather than in a more central position, as is often the case with perforated teeth of later prehistoric periods. Some, though -rot all, of the teeth are slightly stained red with ruddle, or haematite. Perforated teeth of wild animals are a common prehistoric antiquity in Britain'3 and western Europe, and it is not perhaps appreciated how restricted are the decorated examples. These are virtually confined to the classic Magdalenian stations of Franco-Cantabria, though one Upper Perigordian (Gravettian) and a possible Solutrean example can be quoted. Even among the French Mag- dalenian stations teeth decorated in this manner are comparatively rare. The total number of published sites containing such teeth is probably between fifteen and twenty, and in almost all cases only two or three decorated teeth are illustrated.'4 Though simple perforated teeth are a feature of the British Upper Palaeolithic, for example at Paviland,'s no British decorated example is known to the author. 237</page><page sequence="9">French collectors' pieces of such rarity are unlikely to have been available in the British antique market at any time, and the appearance of more than half a dozen specimens, closely resembling those described from Kendrick's Cave, at a local saleroom a generation after the dispersal of the finds is strong evidence that they came from this locality. The specimens themselves are undoubtedly authentic, and closely resemble French examples. It is reasonable to suppose that the teeth were either imported in Middle or Late Magdalenian times from south-west France, or are of British manufacture in the same general Palaeolithic tradition. A handful of other specimens (usually of carved bone or antler), equally close to their continental models, have been found in British caves.16 The decorated horse mandible The most important piece acquired by the Christy Trustees for the British Museum in 1959 was the fragment of decorated horse mandible, Length: 135 mm., B.M. Reg. no. 1959, 12-3, I, labelled as from Kendrick's Cave.'7 It is illustrated here in Pls. LXXXIv and Lxxxv, taken respectively before and after clean- ing by the Research Laboratory.When the fragment was acquired by the Museum, it was, as can be seen in the photograph, somewhat darker than at present, and covered in places with a thin layer of calcite, which concealed parts of the decora- tion. It was also noticed that the third incisor on the broken side of the mandible was loose and slipped in and out easily. (It has since been secured by adhesive.) The decorated horse mandible illustrated by Boyd Dawkins (1880, 158, Fig. A) is undoubtedly the same piece, as can be verified by comparing the position of the blocks of chevron decoration, where these were visible in 188o. It will be noted that Boyd Dawkins's illustration is drawn freehand and is slightly larger than the original, and that the draftsman has removed the loose tooth-though its socket is clearly visible. The fragment is the symphysis, the front part of the lower jaw (or mandible) of a horse, or, more correctly, as Boyd Dawkins described it, 'the incisors, symphysis, and the diastema, broken away in front of the molar series'. The main teeth-carrying part of the jaw and the articulation with the cheek are missing. There is not really sufficient of the jaw to give a definite idea of size, but Dr. Sutcliffe was able to demonstrate, by comparison with modern horse mandibles, that the Kendrick's Cave specimen appeared to be more robust than such modern material as was readily available. The structure of the symphysis was heavier, i.e. the bone was thicker, and there appeared to be a shorter distance between the cheek teeth (pre-molar) and the incisors than in modern species. A socket for a cheek tooth is in fact present, which allows this observation to be made. Possibly the Kendrick's Cave horse may have been a deeper-jawed animal, resembling Przewalski's horse, but this is purely speculative. 238</page><page sequence="10">When the underside of the mandible fragment was examined after cleaning, it became clear that this was decorated with a number of isolated blocks of care- fully incised ornament, placed at regular intervals round the steeply contoured surface. Before cleaning, traces of haematite were visible in the incisors, but these were removed during the cleaning process. A carefully executed rubbing of the decoration (Fig. 5) illustrates the technique of incision, showing where the craftsman allowed his cutting tool to stray beyond the confines of the decorative panels. However, the flattened illustration of this almost cylindrical piece exaggerates apparent irregularities. In the hand the decoration gives a much greater impression of uniformity. Nearly all the incisions appear to be square in cross-section as if a fairly flat cutting edge was used for them. Exceptionally, the narrow block of rather larger single-chevron ornament near the outer margin appears to have been cut with a different implement, perhaps a knife blade, producing a V-sectioned groove. There seems no reason to believe that such decoration could not have been produced by means of flint implements. In addition to this decoration Boyd Dawkins states that 'the outer surface of the incisors is polished by friction against some soft substance . . . more than it would be naturally in the mouth of a horse'. Ingram's explanation (I8 85) is that the 'two lower equine jaws'7 . .. were probably hung also from the necks of the cave men as ornaments . . . in the same way as the natives of New Guinea wear lower human jaws as bracelets'. The enamel of the outer surface of the incisors is exceptionally well preserved, but not unnaturally so, and the polish seems likely to be due simply to the animal chewing silicious grass. The Wild Horse (Equus Caballus) is favoured by the open steppe conditions of the Late Glacial and earlier interstadial periods and its extinction in Britain is thought to coincide with the post-glacial expansion of forest in Zone IV.'8 The Kendrick's Cave horse mandible, on this argument, is likely to belong to the Upper Palaeolithic or to the Late Glacial (Epi-palaeolithic) cultures and to date from the Allerod (Zone II) at the latest.'9 Alternatively, the mandible could post-date the reintroduction of the horse into Britain and belong to the Bronze Age or possibly to the late Neolithic.20 However, though the post-glacial extinc- tion of the horse is well documented for heavily forested regions, it may possibly have persisted in lightly wooded hill-country in the west of Britain. Piggott2z suggests that, in relatively open country, in Caithness and on the oolitic lime- stone area of the Severn-Cotswold tombs, horse was a common wild animal in the late Neolithic period. There are also claims, though these are generally disallowed, for the association of horse with a late Creswellian industry of post- glacial date.22 A Mesolithic or Neolithic date for the Kendrick's Cave mandible, though unlikely, cannot therefore entirely be dismissed on faunal grounds, until further evidence becomes available for the post-glacial extinction of the horse in Britain. 239</page><page sequence="11">No method of measuring the absolute, or chronometric, age of the mandible by scientific means has so far been carried out, though it is hoped to obtain a thermo- luminescent date for the piece, should this method become effective for the dating of bones of Pleistocene age.23 A nitrogen analysis of the mandible has been undertaken which provides a comparative dating for the piece (see Appendix I). This analysis shows that the mandible is likely to be considerably older than the Iron Age bone comb from Kendrick's Cave (also analysed) and is comparable in nitrogen content with Pleistocene mammal bone from the Welsh caves, and therefore may be of com- parable age. Further analyses of the other Kendrick's Cave pieces, at present being carried out, may be expected to confirm this suggestion. Comparative study of the decoration The Palaeolithic date of the horse mandible suggested by the faunal evidence is strongly supported by its style and mode of decoration. The ornament can be briefly described as four blocks of herringbone, accom- panied by a block of single chevrons placed one above the other. The super- ficial purpose of the ornament, as can be clearly seen from different views illustrated (P1. Lxxxv a, d), is to fill the available field with a carefully and sym- metrically arranged series of ornamental blocks, utilizing the underside of the symphysis, the broadest and most suitable part of the horse mandible for decora- tion, and making allowances for the natural holes which occur on each side. The two blocks of ornament nearest the teeth (Fig. 5, bottom) are both incom- plete as the bone is particularly thin and has broken away to the left and right. The right-hand block of decoration is approximately correct in over-all size and the left-hand block was presumably of equivalent size before the three missing incisors and their sockets broke away from the mandible, as each block has seven rows of herringbone ornament. The two rear blocks of ornament are slightly larger in size, and each contain nine rows of the decorative motif. The design is completed by the block of (ten) parallel single chevrons, for which a different cutting tool seems to have been employed (see above). We have mentioned that the flattened development of the design (Fig. 5) is misleading. The photographs show that the underside of the symphysis, though providing a broad surface area for decoration, is steeply contoured, and the appearance of the design on the original is much more symmetrical than it appears in the rubbing. Additionally, the actual carved design on the light-coloured bone emphasizes the intentional negative quality of the incised ornament, which appears to be intended to make the plain areas of bone between the incised lines stand out from the field. The decoration was incised, presumably with a flint implement. No evidence to the contrary was observed, but the knife or burin, of whatever raw material, must have had a fairly short cutting-edge, as the decorative lines are narrow and 240</page><page sequence="12">close together, much closer than in certain other classes of prehistoric bone engraving. Though the cutting-edge was short and the bone presumably fresh when cut, instances of the tool over-running the desired line of ornament are frequent, and the depth of each individual line is irregular, shallow at one end of the groove and deep at the other. The planning of the ornament in the top right FIG. 5. Kendrick's Cave, Llandudno. Decorated horse mandible. (Decoration unrolled.) Scale i:i panel appears to have gone awry, certain cuts are too far apart or discontinuous, and it looks as if the craftsman was misled here by the change in contour in the centre of the field. When comparing the mandible with other decorated examples, attention has to be paid to the motifs used, to the formal decorative scheme, described above, the scale of the decoration, the use of incised decoration on bones in general, and the use of animal jawbones, and other pieces of the animal skeleton which are unlikely or impossible to have been tools, as suitable subjects for geometric decoration. 241 1i</page><page sequence="13">The principal motive used on the Kendrick's Cave mandible is herringbone ornament, of the type described as the disjointed herringbone. As is made clear by Clark in his discussion of Maglemose Art (I938),24 the motive is quite dis- tinct from single linear chevron ornament (Clark's motive h) or single chevrons placed one above the other (Clark's motive x). Both of these motives are characteristic of Maglemose art, whereas the disjointed herringbone is thought to be completely absent from the Maglemose culture, and rare even in Western Palaeolithic art. Recent discussion of Maglemose art confirms Clark's judge- ment.25 There is only one known piece with ornament similar to herringbone and that is a miniature amber sculptured model animal, the silhouette elk head from Egemarke.26 On closer examination the decoration on this piece clearly resolves itself into the use of the individual linear chevron (motive h), though these are drawn one beneath the other, to produce blocks of ornament at first sight resembling herringbone. Also, the blocks of ornament on the Egemarke head respect the contours of the sculpture and are clearly naturalistic in inten- tion. They were probably an attempt to indicate variation in colour or texture of the animal's pelt, and are not comparable with the abstract decoration on the Kendrick's Cave mandible. There are two other Maglemose pieces which must be discussed as they have chevron ornament, and were found in Britain. These are the engraved deer antler tine from Romsey, Hants (Clark, no. xxxix) and the ox-bone perforated adze- head from the Thames (Clark, no. vi). These pieces are at present in the British Museum and were published in the British Museum Quarterly by Reginald A. Smith in 1934. The Romsey deer tine (B.M.Q. viii. I44-5 and P1. XLVI) is decorated circumferentially in a series of rows of large isolated chevrons, deeply engraved. The Thames adze-head, however, is poorly illustrated in the plate accompanying Mr. Smith's publication. A careful drawing (Fig. 7) shows the beginning of a block of connected chevrons resembling herringbone. This is the nearest parallel to the Kendrick's Cave mandible in Britain, but it is basically unsatisfactory. The Thames perforated adze is very much larger in size and correspondingly coarse in decoration. Liversage has recently discussed the attri- bution of coarse, deeply cut decoration to the Kongemose culture in Denmark (as opposed to the finely drawn Maglemose decorative styles).27 Whatever the exact cultural status of the ornament, it seems most likely that this piece (and that from Romsey) both belong to the Mesolithic cultural tradition of Magle- mose affinities at present recognized in Britain. Both pieces are found within the presently accepted area of distribution of the Maglemose. The Thames adze- head (Reg. no. 1927, 7-7, 3) is recorded by Smith in manuscript as found at Hammersmith,28 within the classic area of distribution. It is also a well-known Maglemose type, though it does not closely resemble the elk mattock heads from Star Carr, the only British examples in this class.29 242</page><page sequence="14">The Romsey antler tine, another typical Maglemose product on Clark's analysis, is found within the extension to the Maglemose distribution in Britain proposed by Wainwright in I956.30 The area originally recognized as Magle- mose comprised the east coast and the low-lying river valleys from Yorkshire to the Thames, where these provided inlets from the east, and as far inland as Thatcham, west of Reading. With the extension of the area it was recognized that riverine penetration probably took place through the Thames valley to the Wiltshire and Somerset lowland, and down into Hampshire, where interfluves and portages from the east are available. But this English distribution is still predominantly a lowland one. The mandible from Kendrick's Cave on the Irish Sea does not fall into the same class in terms of either distribution or design. British Neolithic portable art, and rock carvings on Megalithic tombs in Britain, Ireland, and the Continent, do not reveal any close parallels for the Kendrick's Cave ornament. Perhaps the nearest examples are the bone points with deeply incised single chevrons from Skara Brae, but their relationship is clearly with the Romsey tine, rather than the Welsh mandible, and Piggott draws attention to their probable Maglemose ancestry.3" Again, flat stone plaques of one sort or another are common on sites around the Irish Sea, and several of these in the Ronaldsway culture and at Graig Llwyd in north Wales have decora- tion including zigzags and perhaps (in the case of Graig Llwyd) overlapping chevrons. But it is clear from the other elements in their decoration32 and from the eccentrically placed and isolated use of the motives (as well as from the use of the carefully shaped stone plaques themselves) that these pieces are in the Irish/Iberian Megalithic art world. There is no trace of herringbone ornament itself on these pieces and though one can find a number of examples in which it is used on the larger scale in Megalithic tomb art,33 it is always found in combination with other elements and is used in a manner completely foreign to the piece we are studying. It is the Palaeolithic period which furnishes the best parallels to the Kendrick's Cave mandible, but these parallels are almost entirely from eastern Europe and Russia. The only other British piece with geometric decoration from this period is a small flat bone from the Pin Hole cave, Creswell Crags, incised with a single series of overlapping chevrons in no way resembling herringbone.34 Simple linear chevron ornament and single chevrons stacked below one another, usually very carelessly drawn, are known from the French Palaeolithic3s but disjointed herringbone, so characteristic of eastern Palaeolithic art, is almost entirely absent from the Upper Palaeolithic art of western Europe,36 as it is from the Maglemose culture. In Russia herringbone ornament can be quoted from many of the classic sites. The most striking pieces are those from Mezin, including the phallic figurines or anthropomorphic representations and the ivory bracelets first pub- lished by Volkov in 191 1-12, and the considerable quantity of further figurines from the same source made available with Rudinsky's illustrations in 1931.37 243</page><page sequence="15">The use of herringbone, with the addition of lozenge and Greek key patterns seems to appear on nearly every piece of bone recovered from this site. Similar use of herringbone ornament can be paralleled on other Russian sites such as Kostenki I, Avdeevo, Eliseevichi, and Suponevo.38 Equally characteristic of eastern Palaeolithic art is the use of blocks of ornament, either free-standing as at Avdeevo in Russia and Dolni Vistonici in Moravia,39 or in contact as at the Moravian site of Predmost or at Eliseevichi.40 Decoration in single blocks of rigid ornament is also characteristic of the Russian sites.4' Further illustrations of related blocks of ornament which include the use of herringbone are found at Mezhirich42 and at Mezin43 and it is the latter, probably the richest in portable works of art of all the Russian mammoth sites, which provides the best parallels to the Kendrick's Cave mandible. The scale of decoration, the regularity and closeness between the lines of chevrons, and the relationship of the various blocks of pattern to one another, all seem to resemble the decoration found on the Welsh example. Animal jawbones and scapulae seem to be in use throughout the eastern art province as subjects for geometric decoration. Knives made from horse man- dibles and decorated in incised patterns are well known in central Europe on late Upper Palaeolithic sites such as Pekairna and Petersfels.44 Scapulae decorated in a similar manner are known from other eastern European sites (P1. LXXXVI).45 At Eliseevichi a scapula decorated with chevrons was placed over the burial of a man, with the decorated face downwards towards the burial. At Mezin itself the post-war excavations have revealed both a scapula and a mandible, both of mammoth and not of horse, but both decorated in a similar manner to the ex- amples of block geometric decoration already discussed (Fig. 6). The decoration on the mammoth mandible closely resembles that on the mammoth rib bone from Predmost referred to above, while the decoration on the scapula includes a panel of chevron ornament, no doubt originally more extensive. The unusual thing about these pieces from Mezin is that the designs are executed in red paint, instead of being incised into the bone.46 However, the decoration itself and the purpose behind the decoration of animal mandibles with geometric ornament does provide a clear cultural connection between the Welsh and the east European sites and the presence of haematite in the incisions on the Kendrick's Cave mandible itself may possibly be another parallel to the Russian painted example. The nature of the cave occupation Attention should be drawn to the sparse nature of the cave occupation at the Kendrick's Cave site, as it is represented by the contemporary records of the excavation and the surviving pieces. Finds from the cave range from the extinct 244</page><page sequence="16">Pleistocene fauna of the cave earth to the Early Iron Age bone comb and the loom weight of comparable date. They are, however, few in number and include a number of human skeletons, presumed by Boyd Dawkins to be Neolithic in date. With these the horse mandibles and the decorated teeth were thought (by Dawkins) to be associated. The sparseness of the occupation material is partly explained by the smallness and unimportant nature of the cave itself. It is unlikely that a site of this size could ever have been of great importance as a habitation and the finds in their miscellaneous character resemble those from other small caves of north Wales FIG. 6. Mezin. Mammoth bones, jaw and shoulder blade with design in red ochre. Scale c. 1: 7 (After Sovietskaya Archeologiya 4, 1957, 99-) and elsewhere in Britain. Finds of Iron Age or of Roman date are also a well- known feature of such cave occupations. PIalaeolithic cave occupation deposits in Britain fall into two classes. There are a few caves in fortunate areas which contain Upper Palaeolithic occupation debris as rich in flint implements as the French cave sites. Such are the caves near the southern coasts of Great Britain and south of the ice margin in the last glaciation, such as Paviland, Kent's Cavern, and some of the Cheddar caves. Some of the occupation deposits at Cresswell Crags are equally rich but may not be entirely of Pleistocene date. But the 245</page><page sequence="17">FIc. 7. River Thames at Hammersmith. Perforated ox-bone implement. Scale i:i majority of British Pleistocene cave sites appear to be less fortunately situated in environmental terms. Their occupation debris consists at most of a handful of tools or flakes attributable to the last glaciation. Undoubtedly the Kendrick's Cave occupation deposit belongs to the second category. The Pleistocene occupa- tion debris is so sparse that one might query its very existence and the presence of two groups of artefacts of high quality, the horse mandibles and the decorated 246</page><page sequence="18">teeth, is very surprising in this context. Is it possible that these do not represent occupation debris but are the result of deliberate burial, possibly related, as Boyd Dawkins thought, to one or more of the skeletons making up the Kendrick's Cave sepulture? The use of both teeth and mandibles for burials have their parallels in European Palaeolithic archaeology and the fact that almost a string of decorated teeth were found at this site also points in the same direction. At Paviland Cave, in south Wales, was found one famous Upper Palaeolithic burial, accompanied by sophisticated grave goods. One of the Kendrick's Cave burials may have been of equal antiquity. This seems to be the simplest explanation for the appearance of the decorated horse mandible in such a small and isolated site. G. DE G. SIEVEKING APPENDIX I Dr. K. P. Oakley of the British Museum (Natural History) examined the problem of dating the pieces from Kendrick's Cave in the Bloomsbury collection and advised that nitro- gen analysis was most suitable for demonstrating the difference in age between the two pieces submitted, the Early Iron Age bone comb and the decorated horse mandible. Samples were taken for analysis by the Anthropology Section, British Museum (Natural History), and the analysis was carried out in December 1958 by Mr. G. J. Johnson of the Department of the Govern- ment Chemist. The Kendrick's Cave mandible was cleaned after the samples were taken. The results of the nitrogen analysis, including other samples supplied by Dr. K. P. Oakley for purposes of comparison, are as follows. Per cent. Modern bone c. 4"0 Early Iron Age bone comb from Kendrick's Cave 2-83 Decorated equid mandible from Kendrick's Cave 0o65 Ursus bone (late Pleistocene) Paviland Cave 0O93 The results suggest that the mandible is older than the Iron Age comb from the same cave and comparable in date with Pleistocene material from other caves. This is not a conclusive proof of Pleistocene age as no Neolithic samples have been tested and the Pleistocene mammal, though from a similar environment, is not from the same cave. APPENDIX II Report by the Geological Survey and Museum (Petrographical Dept.) on Stone Axe from Kendrick's Cave, Llandudno B.M. Registered no. I959, 12-3, 4 The axe is made from a dark-grey fine-grained rock. In thin section (ENQ. 1718) the rock is foliated and contains fibrous hornblende, pleochroic in yellowish-green to blue-green; granules of iron-ore; and feldspar which has been saussuritized. There are some remains of larger feldspar crystals, but for the most part it forms a fine-grained mosaic. An exact match has not been found for this rock, but it is very similar in type to specimens of sheared epidiorite from Cornwall and it is possible that it comes from that area. 247</page><page sequence="19">I It seems likely that Kendrick was something of a builders' merchant and monumental stone mason. Humphreys (90o8) says 'as Llandudno developed Kendrick's work increased, and to enlarge his accommodation he began excavating in the back of the cave'. 2 Eskrigge, I88o, 155. It seems likely that Eskrigge was'the medical gentleman from Bangor'. 3 Information kindly provided by Miss Hum- phreys, owner of Ardwy Orme in 1957. 4 Kendrick's Cave was visited by the Royal Commission in 195 I, and subsequently on behalf of the British Museum by Mr. Peter Wild of Dyserth in 1957, to whom I am greatly indebted for a careful and detailed description of the site, now comprising a garden shed with flower beds laid out round the entrance. It appears that much of the back of the cave is filled with boulders, and that little trace of the breccia or cave earth can be seen. The archaeological relics came from near the entrance, just behind the rear wall of the shed. The floor here is now concrete or rock. s Humphreys, 1908. 6 Presumably Glynllivon, 5 miles south of Caernarvon. 7 Houlder, C.

The Kendrick's Cave tallies appear much more carelessly decorated, resembling in general terms finds from such sites as All Cannings Cross (Cunnington, M. E., 1923, pls. 12 and 15) and Wookey Hole (Balch, H. E., 1914, pl. xxvi B, no. 4). i2 I am indebted to Mr. C. H. Houlder of the Royal Commission for drawing my attention to this collection and to Mr. F. P. Jowett for making the teeth available for publication. '3 See, for example, the lists of later examples quoted by Bulleid, A., and Gray, H. St. G., 1917, in The Glastonbury Lake Village, ii. 482-5, and Greenwell, W., I877, British Barrows, 327. '4 Even within the small number of published examples there is a good deal of variation in decoration patterns, some teeth being merely notched down one edge and down one side of a plane surface, e.g. Gourdan, Collection Piette, 58, Cat. no. 48626, and Isturitz, St-Perier, R., 1936, La Grotte d'Isturitz, ii, pl. vii, nos. 10, 12, or very faintly incised as St-Perier, R., op. cit. i, pl. vi. 18. The best parallels for the Kendrick's Cave teeth are ox teeth from Laugerie-Basse in the Christy collection (B.M.), and at St-Germain, Reliyuiae Acluitanicae B, pl. v, nos. 6 and 7; and horse teeth from Mas d'Azil, Collection Piette, 275, Cat. no. 47998h, and Brassempouy; Piette, 1907, op. cit., pl.

Inst. xliii, pl. xxiI. 16 In addition to the pieces described by Garrod in The Upper Palaeolithic Age in Britain there are a number of more recent examples from caves in the Bristol region, including most recently a decorated rib bone from Gough's Cave, Cheddar, published rather eccentrically by Miss Powers (Proc. Univ. Bristol Spel. Soc. xii. 2 (1970), 138- 42), and the decorated bone from Armstrong's excavations at Pinhole Cave, Creswell Crags, as yet unpublished. '7 Originally the front parts of two lower jaws of horse were found, apparently together. Only one of them was 'ornamented with a herringbone pattern' (Eskrigge, i88o), but Boyd Dawkins (I880) claimed that 'the outer surface of the bone has been scraped by the hand in both'. The second horse mandible is still missing. 's Godwin, H., 1956, History of British Flora, 18, 38. This phenomenon is known to archaeo- logists in northern Europe, where horse disappears from prehistoric sites after the Late Glacial period, at least in Denmark and in the north German plain. See faunal lists in Clark, J. G. D., 1938, The Mesolithic Settlement of Northern Europe, 223-8. In parts of Sweden the horse is present through- out the Post-Glacial. Lundholm, 1949, quoted in Zeuner, F. E., 1963, A History of Domesticated Animals, fig. 12. 21. True British Upper Palaeo- lithic sites usually contain a fauna in which horse is abundant, often associated with R. Tarandus, C. Megaceros, and C. Elaphus. See Garrod, D. A. E., 1925, The Upper Palaeolithic Age in Britain, for typical examples. '9 Clark, J. G. D., 1954, Excavations at Star Carr, 192-4. 20 Jackson, J.

Some of the examples quoted in east and south-east England (i.e. Grimes Graves and Cissbury) may well be post-Neolithic in date. 22 e.g. Mother Grundy's Parlour, Cresswell Crags upper middle level. See Garrod, D. A. E., I925, The Upper Palaeolithic Age in Britain, 137, and refs. The excavation is an old one and the evidence for the associations is uncertain. Modern excavations at Cresswell Crags, currently awaiting publication, may do much to clarify the situation. 23 Jasifiska, M. and Niewiadomski, T., 'Thermo- luminescence of Biological Materials', in Nature, 227 (I970), I159- 24 Clark, 1938, op. cit. 177-8. 25 Liversage, D., 1966, 'Ornamented Meso- lithic Artefacts from Denmark', Acta Archaeo- logica, xxxviii. 221-37.
