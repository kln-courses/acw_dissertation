<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HOMERIC QUESTION H. G. D. Turnbull Those incomparable epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey f had descended to the Greeks of the classical age with the name of Homer attached to them, but who Homer was, when he lived, where he was born, were matters of doubt and differing tradi- tion. Herodotus ventured the opinion that Homer lived not more than 400 years before his own day - i.e., between 900 and 850 B.C. Other, however, put his date as far back as the 10th and 11th centuries B.C. Seven cities contended for the honour of having been his birthplace; 'the blind old man of Scio's rocky isle/ to use Byron's words is a picturesque figure that catches the imagination, but the only evidence for identifying him with Homer is the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, and the so- called Homeric Hymns were admitted as early as Aristotle's day not to be the work of the author of the Iliad or the Odyssey. Professor Bury^ however, I believe, inclines to the view that the author of the Iliad was a native of Chios. The Iliad tells the story of some of the chief events towards the end of the ten years' siege of Troy, though the Epic itself ends before Troy had been taken. The first line, which invokes the Muse to narrate the wrath of Achilles, gives us the mainspring of the poem. Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon, the nominal Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Army, and withdraws from the war. The Greeks are eventually hard pressed, and Achille.-, is persuaded to allow his bosom friend Patroclus to take the field. Patroclus succeeds in driving back the Trojans but is killed by Hector. Achilles determines to avenge the death of his friend and after a spectacular duel slays the Trojan champion. The Epic ends with the wonderful scene in which old King Priam goes to the tent of the fierce Achilles to beg for the bod)' of his dead son, followed by an account of the burial of Hector as a kind of funeral march bringing the poem to a simple and dig- nified close, ' and calm of mind, all passion spent.' Into this</page><page sequence="2">144 H . G . D. Turnbutt framework are inserted many episodes, some as interesting in themselves, others as helping to develop the main action, such as those describing the part played by the Gods on each side, the duel between Paris and Menelaus, the achievements of Dio- mede, the duel of Ajax and Hector, and so on. Among them we have some of the most wonderful .of Homer's pictures, such as that of Helen on the walls of Troy pointing out. thè leaders of the Greek host, the beautiful scene between Hector and his wife Andromache, and the lamentation of his wife and mother over Hector. In spite of the episodes the ordinary reader would agree with Aristotle that the poem possesses a remarkable unity of tone and treatment and that the whole is marked by that unique com- bination of matter and form which we term Homeric. The subject of the Odyssey is of course the long wander- ings of Odysseus round the waters and lands of the Mediter- ranean, which, though accurately known to the poet, are pictured as ' magic seas and fairy lands forlorn.' The action of the poem^ as of the Iliad, falls within a comparatively short time, and it is by making Odysseus tell the story of his own adventures up to the point when he is about to embark on the voyage that will at last take him home to Ithaca, that the poet gets the whole of the tale .within his framework. Combined with this thread are two others telling of the journeyings of Odysseus' son Telemachus and of the long struggle of the faithful Penelope with the suitors. The structure of the Odyssey is so skilfully put together that even Wolf himself admitted the difficulty of dissecting it and such attempts as have been made to split it up into an original nucleus with later additions have been generally admitted to be failures and have made practically no converts. To turn now to the main problem. It is to Aristarchus, the greatest of the ancient commentators, who lived at Alexandria about .150 B.C., that we owe the division of the Iliad and the Odyssey into 24 books each. Even in his day there were heretics, Chorizontes or Separatists - who held that the Iliad and the Ody- ssey were not by the same poet. They pointed out certain dis- crepancies in custom and religion, such as the fact that in the</page><page sequence="3">Ťhe Homeric Question Iliad the messenger of Zeus is Iris, in the Odyssey, Hermes ; or of vocabulary and grammar. The general opinion of antiquity was that these heretics had been adequately refuted by Aristarchus. Modern scholars have, of course, added largely to the points made by the ancient separatists. To the argument founded on gram- matical statistics I attach little weight ; we know what can be done by the Baconians with this method. But there are certain difficult- ies in the theory of the one author frhich it is almost impossible to explain away. I njay instance two. The story of the Wooden Horse is not mentioned by the poet of the Iliad, and secondly various differences of religious outlook and belief in the Odyssey seem to belong to a later age than that of the Iliad. We certainly seem to trace a development of moral ideas and of a moralising process applied to the very human deities of the Iliad . And the conception of Hades- the shadowy realm of the dead - has deve- loped. In the Iliad Hades is a dim shadowy realm of which nothing appears to be known. Achilles, in his bitter grief for Patroclus, cries out that though the dead forget the dead in the halls of the departed, yet he will remember his friend; Beyond that we get no hint as to how the poet thought of death. In the Odyssey , on the other hand, though Hades is still the shadowy realm, where the shades of the great flit -sadly to and fro, we have the definite idea of the judge of the dead and the punishment of the wicked. And in the Odyssey too we get the first mention of the Elysian fields, unvexed by snow or storm, ' where life is ever sweet.' The argument that it is improbable that early Greece could have produced two epic poets of such genius is sufficiently answered, I think, by the fact that at Athens, a city of perhaps 30,000 free citizens, a period of about sixty years saw the pro- ductions of the masterpieces of three great tragic poets, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. Having seen then that the case of the separatists is by nò means a weak one, let us turn to modem developments of the Homeric problem. Though it was in an essay by an Englishman^ Robert Wood, that the original suggestion of the Wolfian theory</page><page sequence="4">146 &amp;* &amp;. D. Tnťi%hdt was made, it was the Preface to Wolf's edition of Homer in 1795 that started the modern controversy. Wood had argued that writing was unknown to Homer because Josephus believed that the art of writing was unknown to the Greeks at the time of the Trojan War. On this basis Wolf argued that the Homeric poems were at first handed down by oral tradition, that they were not reduced to writing till the age of Pisistratus, who was said to have collected the scatteréd poems of Homer in the sixth cen- tury B.C., and that the admitted unity of the Iliad and the Odyssey was the result of the labours of later editors. There was, therefore, no one Homer, but Wolf was ready to admit that Homer himself was the author of most of the lays which made up the Iliad and the Odyssey and even that he had done something himself towards combining them into structural wholes. Wolf's theory when first published did not meet with much acceptance; it was rejected for instance by Goethe and Schiller but it was of a type that gave the German Professor many chances for the elaborate theorising so dear to him, and German scholarship still prefers to cut Homer up into separate lays. Lachmann for instance finds 18 or possibly even 22 lays in the 24 books of the Iliad. Nietzsche on the other hand developed the obvious inversion of Wolf's theory, and argiied that Homer was the poet who wove pre-existing lays into the Iliad and the Odyssey . Almost every possible variation has been exploited ; on all these ingenuities we may make two remarks - first, that hardly any two of them agree, secondly, that the authors are far better at the discovery of small and ingenious discrepancies that at the perception of large underlying congruities, and that they very often fail to see the wood for the trees. In England Grote held that the original poem was an Achilleid, not an Iliad, and that it consisted of book I and books XI to XXII. The late Sir Richard Jebb, Dr. Walter Leaf and Professor Gilbert Murray have all adopted varieties of the Wolfian theory. We may mention as a curiosity the theory of that witty writer and occasionally acute thinker, the late Samuel Butler, that the author of the Odyssey was a woman, and that that woman was Nausicaa.</page><page sequence="5">The Homeric Question 147 Modern Wolfians have to admit that two of Wolf's data are unsound. Even before the great excavations at Cnossus in Crete had provided abundant proof, Sir Arthur Evans had shown that writing of a kind was known to the Mycenaeans and that it was used before the date of the Trojan War. His dis- coveries at Cnossus have proved that writing was known there about 2, OCX) BŠC. and that a cursive script was in use shortly before the date of the Trojan War. This Minoan script, as it is called, has not yet been deciphered, though some scholars hold that the Phoenician alphabet, from which the Greek alphabet was imme- diately derived, was itself a development of the Minoan script. Though there is no absolutely certain reference to writing in Homer, there is one passage which is most obviously inter- preted as such (the original Wolfians of course would interpret it as referring to pictographic signs or ideograms) and which we may now confidently take to refer to a letter. Homer then must have been familiar with writing and could have used it he wished, just as Shakespeare must have been familiar with tobacco and may even have smoked it, though he never mentions it in his plays. Secondly, it has been pointed out that the earliest authority for the story that Pisistratus collected the Homeric poems is Cicero, five hundred years after the supposed event, and we may well reject the story as a myth arising out of the custom of public recitals of Homer. The question of writing being thus disposed of, what weight are we to allow to theories such as Grote's that the original nuc- leus of the Iliad was an Achilleid? It seems to me that such a partitioning raises more difficulties than it solves. There are of course discrepancies in the Iliad, but so there are in many of the plays of Shakespeare, which one does not on that account explain by duplicate authorship. To join the 1st book directly with the 11th seems to me to result not in increased clearness and unity but in a less satisfactory story. An Achilleis would omit.the pictures of Helen and Andromache which are Homeric if any- thing at all is Homeric. The unity of language, metre, tone and treatment which marked the Iliad seems to me to be a far more 8</page><page sequence="6">i 48 H. G. Ď. ŤurnbuM important argument than that founded upon the discovery of small inconsistencies, which, it is safe to say, not one reader in a hundred would notice unless he were reading the poem with a special eye to such discoveries. Nobody therefore need consider himself to be an unscientific critic if he holds that the Iliad is substantially the work of one great genius. He of course may have used, and probably did use, earlier lays for the foundation of parts of the whole, and there probably are considerable inter- polations. The most noteworthy of these are the catalogue of the Greek army which takes up part of book ii, and the whole of book 10 which tells the story of Dolon and the night raid by Odysseus and Diomede. These are, I think, the utmost con- cessions that we need feel called upon to make to the Wolfians. Even Wolf himself admitted that when he came to re-read the Iliad he felt his arguments dissolving under the spell of the charm and the unity of Homer. And we have already seen that the Odyssey, though quite likely the work of another great ppet, is impregnable in its unity. As Froude said in his Essay on Homer published in 1851 - one of the best things ever written on the subject : - ' it requires more cunning weapons to destroy a Homer; like his own immortals, he .may be wounded, but he can- not have the life carved -out of him by the prosaic strokes of common men. His poems have but to be disintegrated to unite again, so strong are they in the individuality of their genius.' I have already mentioned how modern archaeology has dis- posed of Wolf's argument about writing. Let us see what else it has contributed towards connecting Homer with history. The older modern view was that Troy was an imaginary city. This was in spite of the fact that Alexander the Great founded a new Ilion on the traditional site of the city of Troy, and that Ilium was a flourishing city under the Roman Empire. With the prophetic instinct of genius Schliemann determined to excavate the site on a mound called Hissarlik. He succeeded in laying bare the successive strata of several Troys but the gre^t walls of the 6th or Mycenaean city (Priam's city) were not brought to light till 1893, three years after Schliemann's death,</page><page sequence="7">The Homeric Question 149 by Dörpfeld. This city may be dated from about 1,500 to about 1,200, B.C., the latter figure agreeing well enough with the tradi- tional date of the fall of Troy. The rivers of Homer, the Scamander and the Simois, have both been identified, and their courses correspond closely to the description in the Iliad. At Mycenae, according to old Greek tradition, had been buried Homer's Agamemnon. This too had been dismissed by modern higher criticism as a fable, but Schlie- mann determined to excavate. Close to the famous Lion Gate he laid bare six graves containing remarkable works of art, some of them of gold and silver, which to all those who did not shut their eyes, were just the kind of treasures described by Homer, the products of that pre-historic civilization depicted in the Iliad and the Odyssey. This civilization received the name Mycensean, but, again with prophetic instinct, Schliemann pointed to Crete as its most probable centre. Schliemann's work, in its own results and in the direction it gave to later archaeologists far outweighs all the labours and ingenuities of all the Wolfians, German and English, put together. Excavation in Crete was impossible for Schliemann; it was reserved for Sir Arthur Evans to reveal the great Minoan civi- lization which had its centre at Cnossqs, and which attained its first climax as early as 2,000 B.C. The term ' Mycensean ' had of course to go, and this remarkable pre-historic ciyilization, with centres at Mycense, Tiryns, Cnossus and Troy, is now known as iEgean. The political map of Greece in the earliest times which we can call historical was very different from that of Homer's day. Instead of the Achaeans, Argives and Dapai of Homer we have the Dorians, Ionians and Aeolians. My- cense is no longer the political centre; Sparta has arisen, and Sicily and Magna Grsecia have come into the picture. The Dorian conquest was unknown to Homer, and the only Dorians that Homer mentions are those that the Odyssey speaks of as settled in Crete. Between the climax of JEgean civilization and the beginnings of Greek history lies a period of almost total darkness on which we may hope that future research will throw</page><page sequence="8">150 H. O. D. Turnbull some light. Whether civilization spread from south to north or whether the Achseans as Professor Ridgeway holds were men from the north who brought some culture to the south, while at the same time adonpting the iEgean civilization of the Pelasgians whom they subdued, is a question to which as yet no certain answer can be given. Homer's Achaeans at any rate were Greek; his own language is an earlier form of classical Greek, and Homer himself tells us in the Iliad that all Greeks spoke the same language which means that different dialects were mutually in- telligible. We may quite reasonably call Homer's own language Achaean. The most interesting and remarkable contribution made in recent years to the study of the Odyssey is that of M. Victor, Bérard, in his two beautiful volumes ' Les Phénicians et I/Odyssee published at Paris in 1903. This work has attracted curiously little attention among English scholars, who are, I think, too much bound to merely literary methods. It has been truly said, that M. Bérard on the other hand has tried to combine the qualifica- tions of the philologist, the archaeologist, the poetic critic and the Homeric scholar with those of the geographer, the historian, the sailor, and the man of common sense. Like Odysseus him- self, he spent ten years voyaging round the Mediterranean in a small craft. He had with him his Homer and the Nautical In- structions issued to pilots by the French Admiralty. Working back from the latter to the first voyages in the Mediterranean, he carefully examined a multitude of sites from the seaman's point of view and he came to the conclusion that the Odyssey is not a fairyland of the poet (as argued for instance by Butcher and Lang) but an account of voyages to actual places faithfully described. His book is illustrated by a wealth of photographs beautifully reproduced, as well as of large-scale charts, and at any rate in a large number of cases he has succeeded in making it almost certain that the author of the Odyssey was describing places which we can visit for ourselves. M. Bérard's theory is that Homer used some sort of ancient Phoenician log-book. The advice of Circe to Odysseus, for instance, about the course to</page><page sequence="9">The Homeric Question 151 be kept through the Straits of Messina holds good today for any small sailing boat. On the accurate information supplied by his Phoenician pilot's guide Homer built up his immortal poem, incorporating into it a human interest and we may add an element of traditional faiiy tale. The date of the Odyssey must be be- fore 735 (the date of the foundation of Syracuse), because Phoenician sea-supremacy had by then declined, and it must be later than 1,050, the date of the destruction of Hyperia (Cume, the Phoenician Cuma). The Odyssey was written during the period of the decline of Phoenician commerce about 900 B.C., i.e., about the date which Herodotus assigns to Homer. The poet wrote at a time when the Greeks were displacing the Phoenicians; he wrote for a developed Greek civilization, but he made use of details which the Phoenicians had been collecting for 200 years. Phoenicians thalassocracy in the Mediterranean was not unlike the British in modern times. England holds coaling stations and strategie points ; the Phoenicians chose shallow har- bours close to the sea, near which they could also find a supply of fresh water. From the written records of these mariners "Homer - or the poet of the Odyssey - learned the secrets of the Mediterranean. The poet or poets of the Iliad and the Odyssey have by most scholars been taken to be European Greeks living under the Mycenaean Empire, but M. Bérard makes out a plaus- ible case for the view* that the poet of the Odyssey was an in- habitant of the city of Miletus. The aristocracy of Miletus revered the memory of the glories of Neleus and Nestor, who were regarded as the ancestors of the Ionian colonists that founded the city about 1,000 B.C. For this aristocracy the author of the Odyssey wrote and in book iii of the Odyssey we get a charm- ing picture of the wise old patriarch Nestor, whom Telemachtts visits in his home at Pylos. Herodotus tells us that Thaïes, a native of Miletus, was of Phoenician origin, and Miletus had a Phoenician quarter and a Phoenician aristocracy. The poet was a true Greek, but knew the Phoenicians and learned from them. I will not pretend that this theory is convincing, but it is certainly plausible. Miletus is mentioned in the Iliad as a</page><page sequence="10">152 H. Q. D. Turnļmll Carian Ally of Troy, but the poet of the Iliad does not, I think, know enough of the geography of the West Coast of Asia Minor to allow us to think of him as a native of Miletus. Monro's conclusion that he was a European Greek who lived before the colonization of Asia Minor is still the most probable. M. Bérard, as we have seen, dates the Odyssey from about 900 B.C. An in- teresting and pretty confirmation of this date has been pointed out by Sir Theodore Cook (the present Editor of ' The Field ') who has done more than anyone else in England to persuade scholars of the value of M. Bérarďs work. It is this Calypso in her sailing orders to Odysseus told him to keep the Bear ' ever on the left as he traversed the deep towards Greece.' The poet tells us how Odysseus saw ■ The Pleiads and Bootes that sets late, and the Bear which they also call the Wain, which turns ever in one place and keeps watch upon Orion and alone has no part in the baths of Ocean.' The last line occurs also in the Iliad, and the whole thing is very probably taken from the Phoenician ' Pilot's Guide.' This course, if followed now, would lead one into Africa, but it has been calculated by Dr. Pearson (proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 1881) that in springtime on the Mediterranean the Bear was just above the horizon but not touching the sea (in Homer's words ' having no part in the baths of Ocean ') at a date between 1000 and 750 B.C. To turn now to M. Bérarďs identifications of places. The land of the Lotus-Eaters is, according to him, the harbour of Marsa-el-tiffa (Port of apples) on the island of Djarba in the Syrtes gulf on the North Coast of Africa. The land of Poly- phemus is Nesida (Porto Pavone) a little island off the coast of Naples. The island of the Sirens is Castellucia in the Bay of Amalfi near the Sorrentine Peninsula. The island of Scheria, the home of the Phseacians, is Corfu. All these identifications are the result of a careful comparison, mainly from the sailor's point of view, of the details in Homer's description with the actual places. Most of them certainly show surprising coincid- ences and go to prove that many of Homer's descriptive epithets which commentators had taken to be nearly ornamental are</page><page sequence="11">The Homeric Question l6â accurate and realistic. There are others which are less con- vincing, such as the identification of Calypso's isle with Perejil near Ape's Hill (the ancient Atlas) opposite Gibraltar. As a sample of M. Bérarďs method let us take the Cyclops' land. Homer says that the Phseacians migrated to Scheria after they had been driven from their original home in Hyperia by the Cyclopes. Now Hyperia and Cyclopes are Greek words, and if Homer is correct we should expect to find their equivalents in another language. Hyperia ' the raised city,' which is the same as the Semitic Cuma. Cuma was west of Naples and Vesuvius. Thucydides calls it ' the city in Opicia ; ' Opikia ' land of eyes ' Kuklopia. Corresponding to it is the old name Oenotria, a Semitic compound meaning * eye-circle.' And a large scale profile map shows us the craters of this volcanic country staring at us like empty eyes. The cave of Polyphemus is the great cavern, on the mainland opposite Nesida called the Grotto of Sej anus and still guarded by the tall pines which Odysseus saw. Polyphemus him- self with his one eye and hurling his rocks at Odysseus ' ship is an incarnation of the volcano, quite in the character of Greek Anthropomorphism. And at each end of Nesida is a great obelisk of rock. These are the rocks which Polyphemus hurled. Such are some of the results and methods of M. Bérard. If I were a man of means and leisure I could not think of a more fascinating occupation than to follow Odysseus and M. Bérard in a small yacht round the Mediterranean and compare for my- self the words of Homer with their interpretations as set forth in the beautiful volumes of the French scholar and explorer.</page></plain_text>
