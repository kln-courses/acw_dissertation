The maker/subject of the building ideal architectural maker. This Heideg is always implicated. garian subject is fundamentally alone, But the nature of that subject is ambiguous. In architecture, unlike the other arts, no one person actually makes the object. Not only is there the distinction between designer and builder, or the multi-layered group of designers in an office, but the design ers and manufacturers of the myriad of products used for a project bring the history of their own making with them. Nor is there currently any real thought of the status of these subjects in the larger realm of culture, an inquiry into his/her position in the complex web of social production. The tradition of crafts, so acutely theo rized in the likes of William Morris and John Ruskin, seems to be missing in a contemporary world where making is "dwelling" in a clearing in the forest, communing with nature, sensitive to the landscape and its natural materi als, and aware, until the damage brought by modernism, of local build ing traditions. This ideal dweller makes buildings that are not only expressive in their ecological detailing, but honor the tactile over the visual, the natural over the man-made, the "authentic" over the commodified. Kenneth Frampton's "critical regionalism" is perhaps the most well known of this tradition, and his "Intimations of Tac tility," an early critical regionalism piece, is a particularly good example of this phenomenon forming a foil for this article. He directs his criticism at "instrumentality," the use of "univer 108</page><page sequence="2">sal" procedures, and promotes, listing tion of labor in architecture.

While their exem plary projects tend to be fabricated of stone or wood, and designed by Aalto and Scarpa, the work implicated here is machined, clad, thin, and produced in a more anonymous, less "master/atelier" context.

His interest is a celebration of the range of these procedures, not a material determinism. In addition, Semper indicates that of the four tech nical arts, textile is primary by lending aspects to the other three, thus imply ing that the knot, as the major opera tion of textile, is the essential archi tectural mode of production, and that cladding, the pinning of the fabric onto the frame, is the significant act of enclosure.

She alerts us to the fact that it should be impossible to ignore this issue in texts like "Pale Houses, Silenced Shadows," Assemblage 37, in which she writes, regarding the beautiful and intricate handiwork of Southern pre-civil war dresses found in an attic. "The splendor of these amaz ingly architectural pieces takes my breath away. 1 think of the labor of dark hands cutting, stitch ing. boning, tatting, embroidering, washing, iron ing, buttoning, but never wearing, never hoping to wear, and I inhale deeply in righteous indigna tion. but also in awe of this rich archive of labor."

Rizzoli, New York, 1988 3 While it may seem that the entire oeuvre of modernism, with its privileging of construction over form, should be included here, I have found that the most interesting development of this theme is outside the canons of high modernism. Someone like Mies, for all of his rhetoric - god is in the details; only issues of construction not form are entertained - doesn't actually develop his buildings or his polemic in a sustained way. His concern is (and this is not a criticism) more spatial than constructive.</page><page sequence="3">PEGGY DEAMER 4 Gravaguolo, Adolf Loos. Rizzoli, New York, 1982, p. 61.

While this separation could be understood to ultimately glorify the purity of true art, Loos is more interested in the potential social liberation that occurs when the utilitarian laborer is spared the burden of making "art" and soci ety spared the need to aestheticize everyday life.

THE FACTORY-MADE HOUSE: GROPIUS ET AL It is ironic to move away from the most (politically) revolutionary of con texts for architectural production-the Russian Revolution-to one of coloniza tion and war. But the issue of the fac tory-made house brings us to these themes. It also seemingly brings together many of the issues raised above: the deployment of the full "apparatus" of mechanical production; the indeterminate but critical issue of the role of design and the architect; the dilemmas raised by the non unique, repeatable object; the poten tial distance between the location of "dwelling" and the location of produc tion. It is ironic also that this context provides the material and expertise to build what was impossible for Tatlin and the Third International. The préfabrication of buildings was a significant feature of the nineteenth century colonization. Not only were industrialization and colonization linked as economic phenomena, but they also were physically linked in the form of the exported prefab building. Used for both military and administra tive purposes as well as for home more refined, recognized architects increasingly became interested in the possibilities of pre-fabrication. World War I brought both the need and the expertise for prefabricated housing, particularly in Germany. There, Walter Gropius, among others, developed mass produced houses. Per haps the most notable experiment was his design for the Growing House exhi bition of 1932. At that time Gropius was a consultant to the Hirsch Copper House Department that had bought the patent for what was known as the Foster Metal pre-fabrication design. The Growing House, made of copper, was a knock-down system in which each structural element constituted a wall-section adapted at its edges to be joined to other sections. Each section was a wooden skeleton frame clad on both sides with metal sheathing, the space between filled with insulation. With World War II, the urgent need for prefabricated construction shifted from Europe to America due to the acute need for housing in wartime industrial centers.
