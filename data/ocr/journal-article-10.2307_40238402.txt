Rhyme can be an exacting taskmaster and a cold tyrant. Pre- occupation with technique and rhyme may make for art that is too selfconscious. This is true especially of rhymes in African languages where words end almost invariably with a vowel, and where stress and accent play an important part in meaning. Here, rhyme may obscure meaning, stem the even flow of thought, and lead even to artifi- ciality and superficiality. Our dramatists and "pure" poets are pioneers and innovators who are trying to find a suitable outward form for their emotional content. They would be well advised to develop as flexible a system as possible. In his "The Concep- tion and Development of Poetry in Zulu", Vilakazi has worked out an interesting rhyme scheme. Actually, it is not new. Vilakazi has been forestalled by the European poets who attempted to develop double and even triple rhyme. Owning her weakness, Her evil behaviour, And leaving with meekness, Her sins to her Saviour. One more unfortunate, Weary of Breath, Rashly importunate, Gone to her death! Vilakazi pleads for a similar development in Bantu (Zulu) poetry. But his scheme is even more rigid and inflexible because the rhyme is not only double (i.e. beginning with the penultimate consonant), but is governed by the class of the penultimate con- sonant. Thus "Zulu" cannot rhyme with "mulu" for fricative alveolars have no ear- relation or even phonetic relation with nasal bi-labials. In this rhyme scheme, there- fore, bilabial consonants can only rhyme with bilabials, alveolars with alveolars, etc. This is too rigid and crippling a scheme for dramatic purposes. It may be suitable for "pure" poetry, but the mountains, the seas, the storms, the earthquakes of tragedy do not lend themselves to a neat rhyme scheme of this kind. The dramatist deals with actions, passions, and furies that burst through the stagnant, dam-like banks of rhyme, and can only be contained in the wider and less defined sea-basin of blank and parallel verse. Says Sir A. Quille r-C ouch, "Those elders of you who have followed certain earlier lectures On the Art of Writing' may remember that they set very little store upon metre as a dividing line between poetry and prose, and no store at all upon rhyme. I am tempted today to go farther, and to maintain that, the larger, the sub- limer, your subject is, the more impertinent rhyme becomes to it and that this imper- tinence increases in a sort of geometrical progression as you advance from mono- syllabic to disyllabic and on to trisyllabic rhyme . . .</page><page sequence="3">14 African Drama m "But when we pass from single rhyme to double . . .we find the English poet almost a pauper; so nearly a pauper that he has to achieve each new rhyme by a trick - which tricking is fatal to rapture, alike in the poet and the hearer ... No one can be clever and ecstatic at the same moment ... If rhyme be allowed to that greatest of arts, if metre, is not rhythm above both for her service?" II What poetic form is suitable for Bantu dramatic work, then? African dramatists should develop a form suitable to the structure, nature and flow of their language. Personally, I think the poetic form used by the ancient Hebrew writers is the best we can find for it is natural to African genius and to our Native speech. What then is the form of ancient Hebrew poetry? In The Outline of Literature it is defined thus: "Parallelism of thought and expression - a sort of magnified alliteration - is the dis- tinctive of all Hebrew poetry". Laurence Binyon gives a more detailed explanation: "Hebrew poetry differs in form from the poetry of other great literatures in not having metre or rhyme . . . But this poetry is not a loose form, like what is known as free verse. Far from it. Its principle is what has come to be called 'parallelism'; that is, a symmetrical arrangement of parallel clauses. The simplest and commonest form is the arrangement of two, or sometimes three, of such clauses, though there are more com- plex forms corresponding to what we call stanzas; and the device of the refrain may be used, as in our ballads, with an enforcing effect. In the couplet, where the parallelism is most obvious, the thought is expressed in the first line and then re-expressed, with a difference, in the second; as if one were to hold up a cut stone to the light and then, turning it slightly, show another facet. "There is no counting of syllables, or of stresses; but this system performs in its own way the function of metre; it has in common with metre what is absent from prose, the expectation of recurrence in the form. "The principle which is the foundation of the form of the poetry pervades also the thought. There is a rhythm of thought as well as a rhythm of sound." This form, it seems to me, is the most suitable because it embraces the elements which already exist in Bantu tribal literature - strong rhythm, repetition, simple and natural imagery, etc. If we adopt this poetic form in our drama, we would be develop- ing and building on what we already have, and not taking something totally alien to our tribal culture. The present writer has used this form in some of his plays. The form is most flexible and has endless possibilities for variety, power and mood. Professor GP. Lestrade confirms my contention that it is inherent in Bantu blood and art.</page><page sequence="4">AND POETRY 15 Child of Mmamokhathsane, Thesele, Thesele, deep chasm, Cattle enter into it on their way, Also people enter into it on their way. You who gave the Bakwena cattle to kill Please give your aunt cattle to kill, Please give Mmasetenane cattle to kill, that she may carry the meat away, That she may say, These are the fat stomachs of cattle and of people. After quoting these two stanzas from a traditional praise-poem (a translation from the original Sesutho), Prof. Lestrade (in The Critic) says, "Another feature of this verse, which will have been noticed in the example above, is the occurrence of parallel- ism, as seen, e.g. in the third and fourth lines of stanza 1, and in the second and third lines of stanza 2 of the above poem. The parallelism is one of meaning in the first place, and of rhythm in the second. In the parallel lines of the first stanza, the latter halves of the lines are identical, while in the remaining half we have the same verb with different nouns as subjects; in the lines in the second stanza, the first halves are identical while in the second half the proper noun Mmasetenane denotes the same person as the common noun nkxonon'as. Such parallelism may be direct, as in this instance, or it may be what may here be called cross-parallelism or chiasmus, the first half of one line corresponding to the second half of another, and vice versa. A further feature of structure of these lines is what we shall call linking, i.e. the repetition of a word or idea occurring in the second half of a line in the first half of the succeeding line, e.g. "It has ploughed with hair on its body, the big beast, The big beast of the Setabanes, Of the Setebanes, of Rapodiles." Metrical rhythm, parallelism, chiasmus and linking are thus the chief features of these poems." Therefore, I plead with all my strength that as far as possible we should develop this form in our African drama.</page><page sequence="5">16 African Drama Î  But there is another and as useful form we could adopt, the form used by Shake- speare and others. It, too, comes naturally and without effort to the African writer. It is native to our genius. "The verse of Shakespeare's early dramas is fluent and facile, full of antithesis, abounding in rhyme, quick and trim in movement, but lacking in melody and in variety of cadence. Formally, it is highly conventional and careful to assert itself unmistakably as verse ... As Shakespeare's power developed his verse became continually more flexible and free, more various in cadence, and more regard- less of regularity. Unstopped lines and light endings continually increase in frequency. Rhyme becomes more and more rare, and extra syllables are more and more often placed at the end of the line. The line itself becomes less and less insistent. The verse pauses anywhere, at quite irregular intervals, and the tendency to pause at the end of a line as such disappears almost completely if not altogether. It depends less and less on line structure, on any orderly and regular sequence of sound within the line, and more and more on the balance of sentences and on emphasis." The tribal poet, too, cared nothing about line structure and regular sequence. He fixed his mind on the poem as a whole. Arguing about something else, Vilakazi un- wittingly confirms my contention, ". . . the Native mind would treat the poem essen- tially as a whole, the parts having very little meaning as such, and not being conscious- ly analysed out as parts ... I think the working of a Bantu-poet's mind . . . presents good food for thought to the 'Gestalt' school of psychologists, who have deeply inter- ested themselves in the working of the brain in memory work. A 'gestalt' is a configu- ration or a pattern characteristic of a given experience, not fragmentary or a partial experience. It is more than the sum total of its parts or its component stimuli. It possesses unique properties of its own that its separate parts do not possess. This may be the mental make-up of a Bantu poet's mind when he tries to ... compose his poems." And from this tribal tendency to the form of verse used by Shakespeare is an easy step, as is already evidenced in the works of some of our modern African poets. We cannot all be Shakespeare, but we can certainly use this form profitably. In it rhythm plays a far more important part than rhyme, and rhythm is essentially African. The tribal African was under the rigid rule of pattern. There were rigid patterns of behaviour, rigid patterns even in architecture (the hut) and in village or kraal planning. This love of pattern certainly had grave disadvantages, but it gave birth to a marked sense and love of rhythm. This sense of rhythm is seen even in the movement of tribal people: how rhythmically graceful and charming is the motion of tribal belles! how rhythmically powerful and warrior-like the trot of tribal males! The element is also well marked in African music and in tribal plastic art. The dances, too, are strongly rhythmical. In fact, one may almost say that the greatest gift of Africa to the artistic world will be - and has been - Rhythm. How can we capture this power of rhythm and infuse it into our dramatic work? There is no doubt that Shakespeare, the Greek dramatists and the Hebrew writers used certain ingredients to produce rhythmic beauty in their works. There is a kind of</page><page sequence="6">AND POETRY 17 rhythmic law underlaying all great literature, all beauty. One ingredient is poetic expression, but there are others. The very regular appearance of ghosts, clowns, fairies, kings, duels, lovers, etc., in Shakespeare, and the common use of the device of the chorus, of suffering heroes and anthropomorphic gods in Greek writers, help to give a rhythmic effect to these literatures. We, too, can use archaic tribal forms to produce a form of poetry and rhythmic effect distinctly African. Rhythm is more than a physical sensation. It is inspired uniformity in motion, giving birth to thought and emotion and visions. [The South African Outlook, vol. 69, 1 April 1939, pp. 88-90. For B.W.
