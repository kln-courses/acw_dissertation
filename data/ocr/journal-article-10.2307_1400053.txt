<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SHACKLES OF REASON: SUFI/DECONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION TO RATIONAL THOUGHT lan Almond Bosphorus University, Istanbul He who claims to know that God is his Creator While not being perplexed, this is the evidence of his ignorance. Futuhat, chap. 50, p. 81 If one were ambitious enough to compile a chronology of oppositions to Western rational thought-a chronology broad enough to include such figures as al-Ghazall, Meister Eckhart, Rousseau, Blake, Nietzsche, and Levinas-it would be interesting to see what kind of common denominators, if any, such a study would produce. Met- aphors of wind, breath, spirit, and freedom would probably abound, along with a common emphasis on 'openness' (futuh/ouvert-an important word for both of the thinkers examined here), an aversion to rigidity and systems, an exaltation of wan- dering, and a defamation of reason as somehow unnatural and restrictive-in other words, a rejection of reason that would be almost aesthetically motivated. In this study, two such oppositions to rational and metaphysical thought will be examined alongside one another: Muhyiddin Ibn 'ArabT's critique of nazar or reflective thought and Jacques Derrida's much wider reexamination of the entire theo-philosophical tradition of the West-the "fundamental conceptual system pro- duced by the Greco-European adventure," as Derrida puts it.2 In dealing with texts whose origins lie almost eight hundred years and many more kilometers apart, one important point should be kept in mind. It is not the intention of this study to turn a thirteenth-century Sufi into a postmodern theorist, any more than it is our desire to 'Islamicize' Jacques Derrida or transform his writings into a form of Islamic mysti- cism (producing a "Jacques of EI-Biar," as John D. Caputo has already quipped). Over the past fifteen years, scholars from departments of comparative religion and theology around the world have been rediscovering in their own religious traditions various precedents for Derrida's deconstructive writings, a trend there is certainly every reason to encourage. Figures such as Pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, Sarmkara, Lao Tzu, and Ayn al-Qudat Hamadani have all been credited with deconstructing the rigid logocentric assumptions within their own respective faiths, rescuing a more authentic spirituality from the legalistic metaphysics of their times.3 Certainly one aim of this study is to show how a similar deconstructive process can be found in the writings of Ibn 'ArabT-a demonstration, however, that is far from turning the Great Shaykh into a medieval poststructuralist. Hopefully, such comparisons will act as a point of departure for this study, and not as a destination in themselves. Rather than simply serving up a postmodern ver- sion of the Futuhat and the Fusus al-Hikam, a number of more serious questions will 22 Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 53, Number 1 January 2003 22-38 ? 2003 by University of Hawai'i Press</page><page sequence="2">be raised: what is the exact relationship between these two thinkers? How analogous can the vocabulary of a Sufi saint be to the work of a contemporary French theorist who, on his own admission, "rightly pass(es) for an atheist"?4 Do the metaphors, strategies, and motifs of deconstruction change their meaning at all in the context of a comparison with Sufism? Can Ibn 'ArabT teach us how to read Derrida differently (and vice versa)? The first thing the attentive reader notices about both Derrida and Ibn 'Arabi is the absolute singularity of their positions. Neither of the two seems willing to attach his writings to a particular school of thought (madhahib) or tradition; a curious soli- tude seems to pervade their work as they critique-sometimes subtly, sometimes openly-practically every thinker they encounter, be they Mu'tazilites or phenom- enologists, Ash'arites or structural linguists, esotericists (al-batiniyya) or existen- tialists. Probably the best example of this in Ibn 'Arabi occurs toward the end of his treatise Shajarat al-Kawn, where the Shaykh envisages an omnitemporal Allah fore- telling to Muhammad the numerous ways in which subsequent thinkers are going to misunderstand His Essence: O Muhammed, I created my creatures and summoned them to Myself, but they differed among themselves with regard to Me. One group among them claimed that Ezra was My Son (IX: 30), and that My hand is fettered (V: 64-69). These are the Jews. Another group claimed that the Messiah is My Son (IX: 30), that I had a wife and child. These are the Christians. Another group gave Me partners. They are the idolators. Another group gave Me a form. They are the corporealists [the Mujassima]. Another group made Me limited. They are the Mushabbiha. Another group made Me non-existent. They are the Mu'attila. And there is another group who claim that I shall not be seen in the hereafter. They are the Mutazilites.5 Not surprisingly, passages such as these have earned Ibn 'Arabi the description 'arrogant' on more than one occasion. Not only does the Shaykh distance himself from his contemporaries, but he puts his criticisms in the mouth of the Divine. Clearly, the author wants to avoid the two dangers present to any Islamic thinker- the possibility of ta'til or complete denudation of God's attributes on the one hand and tashbih or overdetermining God with positive attributes on the other. This diffi- cult course that Ibn 'Arabi charters between the apophatic and the cataphatic will have to be followed carefully if we are to understand exactly why the Shaykh remains aloof from every form of reflective thought. The author's objections to the groups of thinkers mentioned in the passage above-the Mu'tazilites, the Mujas- sima, the Mu'attila, and the Mushabbiha, not to mention the Christians and Jews- are not merely partisan quibbles. Some common error lies at the heart of Ibn 'Arabi's criticisms, some perceived, fundamental mistake motivates his slightly generic dis- missal of five centuries of Islamic thought. Derrida, likewise, cultivates a certain distance between his own textual strat- egies and the thinkers he writes about, isolating moments of self-presence in their work that re-consign them to an uninterrupted tradition of logocentric metaphysics. Unlike in Ibn 'Arabi, praise and critique in Derrida's writings are often subtly Ian Almond 23</page><page sequence="3">blended together, particularly in dealing with figures whose own aims seem to resemble closely those of Derrida's. Derrida's 1964 essay on Levinas, while never renouncing a tone of respect for the thoughts "assembled and enriched in that great book Totality and Infinity,"6 nevertheless portrays a Levinas "resigned to betraying his own intentions in his philosophical discourse."7 In "Structure, Sign and Play," Derrida's "fascination" with Levi-Strauss' "remarkable endeavour" doesn't stop him from finding the anthropologist guilty of "an ethic of nostalgia for origins" (d'ethique ... de nostalgie de I'origine).8 Various figures in Christian negative theology (St. Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, Eckhart), held by many to be a medieval precedent for deconstruction, have received similar treatment from Derrida. On the one hand he has taken great pains to point out his admiration for negative theology-a "corpus at once open and closed," and written in a language "that does not cease testing the very limits of language."9 On the other hand negative theology, for all its radical questioning of metaphysics, still "belongs ... to the onto-theological promise it seems to break."10 It still remains ultimately logocentric in its purpose: to preserve the secret name of God. In other words: just as Ibn 'Arab! believes that no thinker can provide "a defini- tion of the Real [al-haqq],"' Derrida insists that no thinker can escape the history of metaphysics. Even the trinity of Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger, credited with no less an achievement than "the critique of the concepts of Being and truth ..., of self- presence ..., and the destruction of metaphysics," even these initiators of the dis- solution of Western metaphysics remain "trapped in a kind of circle" (pris dans une sorte de cercle).12 Something remains, some kind of special knowledge or realiza- tion, that distinguishes Ibn 'Arab! and Derrida from their respective traditions; 'something' both thinkers feel they have understood, some kind of gnosis or situa- tion, an awareness of a hidden complexity that enables them to recontextualize their predecessors and contemporaries so confidently. It is to the examination of this special 'something' that the rest of this study is dedicated: what exactly motivates the comprehensive rejection by Ibn 'Arab! and Derrida of metaphysical thought? Tempted by brevity, one could sum up the reasons of both thinkers in two easy responses: for Ibn 'Arab!, the philosophers and the the- ologians have yet to understand the simultaneous transcendence (tanzih) and immanence (tashbih) of God.13 For Derrida, Western metaphysics has never really problematized the word 'meaning', nor has it come to terms with the fact that signs do not lead us to 'meanings', but simply to other signs. Such responses, however, would be inadequate. The distrust of metaphysics by both Derrida and Ibn 'Arab! is far more complex, and will involve an analysis of terms such as al-haqq and ecriture if we are to understand their objections at all. The Emancipatory Project in Derrida and Ibn 'Arabr: Freeing al-Haqq and L'Ecriture from the Shackles of Reason Both Ibn 'Arabi and Derrida, in their own contexts, speak of fetters and freedom. It is no exaggeration to say that a certain emancipatory spirit underlies both their 24 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="4">projects-'emancipatory' not in any social sense but rather the emancipation of the unknowability of the Real / the uncontrollability of writing, from the shackles of rational/metaphysical thought. Indeed, one could say the entire aim of Of Gramma- tology is the liberation of ecriture from "the rank of an instrument enslaved to full and originarily spoken language."14 Of course, these are not identical gestures: Derrida's liberation is a purely semantic one, whereas Ibn 'ArabT has a more spiritual aim in mind. Nevertheless, the reaffirmation of something vital, inconstant, and elu- sive that defeats all our attempts to talk about it will play a common role in the vocabularies of both thinkers and evolve according to a common structure. A look at the contexts of the writings of both Ibn 'Arabi and Derrida may help us to understand this better. The People of Reflection (Ahl al-Nazr) and the Idolatry of the Sign In the Futuhat, Ibn 'Arabi points out that the root meaning of the word for reason ('aql) comes from the same root as the word for 'fetter' ('iqal).15 It is a convenient etymology for the Shaykh, whose main objection to the philosophers and theolo- gians is that they narrow and limit a "Divine Vastness" (al-tawassu' al-ilahi) that is without attribute or limit. "Every group have believed something different about God,"16 he writes, always exuding a very definite impatience with those who mis- take their specific beliefs for knowledge of the Absolute. Ibn 'Arabi's impatience here would be with both affirmative and negative schools of theology, both with those who insist that God can be predicated through His effects (the Ash'arites) and with those who say that nothing could ultimately be predicated of God, except only what He is not (the Mu'tazilites). Such a debate would have formed a common back- ground to Ibn 'ArabT's thought, producing such a proliferation of schools, quarrels, and doctrines that one can well sympathize with the Shaykh's words: "I hear the grinding, but I don't see any flour."17 Thus, a believer in the eternal attributes of God such as al-Ash'arT (873-935) can declare: We confess that God is firmly seated on His Throne.... We confess that God has two hands, without asking how.... We confess that God has two eyes, without asking how.... We confess that God has a face.... We affirm hearing and sight, and do not deny that, as do the Mu'tazila, the Jahmiyya, and the Khawarij... 18 whereas other, more apophatically inclined groups such as the Mu'tazilites are capable of producing statements that, for Western readers, are reminiscent of Dio- nysius the Areopagite: He is no body, nor object, nor volume, nor form.... Neither is he provided with parts, divisions, limbs, members.... He cannot be described by any description which can be applied to creatures.... He is a being, but not as other beings....19 In a sense these two extreme positions of tashbih (anthropomorphism) and tanzih (incomparability) provided the parameters of a very wide debate. How much can we know about God? What is the relationship between the Divine Names (the Merciful, the Generous, the Knower, etc.) and the Divinity-are they simply analogies? Or do lan Almond 25</page><page sequence="5">they reflect some positive eternal attributes? How much of our beliefs concerning God are actually valid? How can we ascertain this? If there really is, as the Qur'an says, "nothing like Him" (42 :1 1), then how can we know anything about God at all? Such questions, among others, had been debated over the centuries by the phi- losophers of the Kalam. As Abdel Haleem has shown, the term 'Kalam' is difficult to define with any accuracy.20 Literally, it means 'speech', and denotes the general discussion of religious issues pertaining to the Qur'an-not just the extent of God's knowability, but also such questions as the problem of free will and divine pre- determinism, the status of the Qur'an, and the implementation of the Shariah. 'Kalam' was not simply a discussion of religious topics, however-it usually required the presence of an adversary, an opposite position against whom the various argu- ments could be raised. It is not difficult to see why Ibn 'Arab! wanted to distance himself from the thinkers of the Kalam and dismiss their efforts with words such as 'meddlesome' (fudul) and 'obfuscation'. For a thinker whose entire approach to divine epistemology can be summed up in the (to many) cryptic exclamation 'He/ not He' (huwa la huwa), a thinker who insists that God is both immanent and tran- scendent, such polarizing debates would have reinforced the very kind of binary thinking about God that Ibn 'ArabT was trying to escape. Another aspect of Kalam that Ibn 'Arabi would have resented is its claim to a knowledge of God through reflection and reason (nazar, 'aql), the kind of knowledge that for Sufis could only by obtained through 'tasting' and 'unveiling' (dhawq, kashf). Some past definitions of Kalam are quite telling in this respect-al-Farabi saw Kalam as "a science that enables a person to support specific beliefs and actions laid down by the Legislators"; al-lji goes slightly farther, insisting that Kalam does not support but rather "establish[es] religious beliefs, by adducing arguments and banishing doubts." For Ibn Khald0n, Kalam is "the science that involves arguing with rational proofs in defense of the articles of faith and refuting innovators who deviate from orthodoxy," while the modern Muhammad 'Abduh proposes as a definition "a science that studies the Being and Attributes of God, the essential and possible affirmations about Him."21 In all of these definitions, a certain theme is constant: the acquisition of divine knowledge in order to justify social and legal practices, facili- tate hermeneutics, systematize theology, and ascertain exactly what is orthodox and what is heresy (ilhad). The Incomparability of the Real Ibn 'ArabT's first gesture in reply to the philosophers and theologians is to underline, beneath all the ideas and concepts of God that we construct for ourselves, an utterly unknowable, unthinkable God, bereft of all names and attributes (shifa). This unknowable entity, which is the source of all effects and actions but cannot be described by any of them, he refers to as the Divine Essence (dhat Allah) or some- times the Real (al-haqq)-a word that, for Western readers, is not without its Laca- nian echoes.22 "In our view there is no disputing the fact that the Essence is unknown."23 Rather like Eckhart's God beyond God and Plotinus' Ineffable One, it 26 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="6">remains forever untouched by every proposition we try to make about it. Hence the error of the rational thinkers, who have mistaken their constructs for the Real itself: When a person rationally considers God, he creates what he believes in himself through his consideration. Hence he considers only a god which he has created through his consideration.24 Such constructs Ibn 'Arabi refers to, near the end of the Fusus al-Hikam, as the "God of Belief," which changes according to the predisposition of the believer.25 As we shall see, Ibn 'ArabT has a generally benign attitude toward such constructs, as long as the believer is aware of the "actual situation"-that is, the artificiality of his/her God. The problem with thinkers such as the Ash'arites is that they have built and elaborated their entire theology upon an empty construct-one which they feel sure to be 'God'. It is here where parallels with deconstruction become most interesting; just as Derrida sees all metaphysical thinkers as basing their thought systems upon illusory moments of 'self-presence'-a "center" that is never really the center,26 a signifier that can only ever lead to other signifiers-Ibn 'Arabi sees all reflective thinkers as building their ideas about God on something that is not really God. In both cases, the philosopher falls victim to a certain illusion-the unquestioning conviction that the semantic foundation of the thinker's thought-system ('God', 'experience', 'reality', 'innocence') is somehow sufficient in itself, and requires no further justification. The Infinity of the Real Apart from the incomparability of the Real, which renders every conceptual propo- sition about the Real potentially idolatrous, there are three other reasons why Ibn 'Araby feels that our rational faculties can tell us nothing about the Real-and all three have to do with the uncontrollability/unthinkability of the Real. The first and most important reason why reflective thought is inadequate for giving us any knowledge about God is, quite simply, its finitude: He who does not restrict Him does not deny Him, but affirms His Reality in every formal transformation, worshipping Him in His infinite forms, since there is no limit to the forms in which He manifests Himself.27 ... [T]he intellect restricts and seeks to define the truth within a particular qualification, while in fact the Reality does not admit of such a limitation. It is not a reminder for the intellectuals and mongers of doctrinal formulations who contradict one another and denounce each other ... and they have no helpers. (3 :91)28 Although in this passage it is not so much the unknowable Real that is infinite, but rather its manifestations, the problem such infinity presents to the narrowing param- eters of Reason remains the same. God encompasses an infinite sea of forms, He "possesses relationships, faces and realities without limit."29 Among this endless, ever-fluctuating plethora of images and forms, the philosophers and thinkers have seized upon one or two images and attempted to found their epistemologies on lan Almond 27</page><page sequence="7">them, mistaking them for the Real itself. In this sense, all theologies for Ibn 'Arabi are idolatries (shirk) if they do not take into account the infinite range of divine possi- bilities in addition to their own. Although Ibn 'Arabi has many positive things to say about reason, his insistence on the theologians' ignorance of God's infinite semantic richness pervades both the Fusus al-Hikam and the Futuhat. If Ibn 'Arabi loses his patience with those who chain the Real to their own meanings and dismiss any other manifestation as heresy, Derrida spends a similar amount of energy exploring the infinite semantic possibilities of a text-and how various thinkers have sought to restrict these possibilities to their own interpretations. For Derrida, the desire to restrict a text and make it say only what we want it to is embodied in the 'preface'-the short text with which an author introduces his work, and which is intended to 'sum up' the general aim and intentions of the work that follows, so that no misunderstandings can take place. In Dissemination, Derrida is particularly interested in the Hegelian preface-how Hegel sees, and doubts, the Vorwort as a way of ensuring that certain unacceptable interpretations of his work will never take place. In Ibn 'ArabT's terms, the preface is the attempt to limit the text's infinite possibilities (batin) to one interpretation only (zahir), the others being considered heretical. It chains the semantic infinity of the text to one manifestation and one only-that of the author's desired reading. A preface is an attempt to say what is, has been, and will be: The preface would announce in the future tense ('This is what you are going to read') the conceptual content or significance ... of what will already have been written.... From the view point of the foreword, which creates an intention-to-say after the fact, the text exists as something written ... which ... a bidden omnipotent author (in full mastery of his product) is presenting to the reader as his future.... The pre reduces the future [pos- sibilities of the text] to the form of manifest presence.30 It is this 'reduction' that both Ibn 'Arabi and Derrida, in their own contexts, will object to, even though the reasons for such an objection will not be the same. If Derrida feels the original, reductive purpose of the preface to be an "essential and ludicrous operation" (ibid.), it is not because the text (like Ibn 'ArabT's God) already has within it an untapped infinity of meanings, but rather because of the uncontrol- lable semantic play within the text that must necessarily open up new and unex- pected readings of the work-new readings that no preface, however careful and comprehensive, can anticipate. On this point, at least, the difference seems clear: Ibn 'Arabi resists logocentric reductions of the Real on the grounds of God's inex- haustible Divinity, while Derrida's objections toward totalizing exegesis stems more from a belief in the unarrestable play of forces within the text, rather than any theo- logical concept of its infinite unfathomability. The Unrepeatability of the Real Ibn 'Arabi's second reason why the Real resists all exclusive appropriations lies per- haps somewhat closer to the structure of Derrida's own approach: the fact that the 28 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="8">Real, in all its manifestations, never repeats itself. Ibn 'ArabT's main justification of this is the Qu'ranic verse 55:29, Each day He is upon some new task. It is a feature of the Real that, although alluded to only briefly in the Fusus,31 is elaborated upon quite heavily in the Futuhat: That which is past never returns, since were it to return, something in existence would repeat itself, but there is no repetition because of the Divine Vastness. (pp. 104-105; 11.185.27) [God's] returnings undergo variation (tanawwu'), His Self-disclosures are diverse, and His loci of manifestation are multiple, without repetition. (p. 105; 11.589.28) But the gnostics ... know that "God never discloses Himself in a single form to two individuals, nor in a single form twice." [Ibn 'Arabi is quoting Abu Talib al-Makki, 111.384.18) Because, in one sense at least, God is an infinite storehouse of images, the unre- peatability of the Real is directly linked to the infinity of the Divine Vastness. In one single, theological bound, Ibn 'Arabi re-inscribes every act of signification that has ever taken place as only a minute fraction of the infinite capacity of the Divine. Ibn 'Arabi is hardly the first to place such emphasis on the infinity of God-his origi- nality lies, as we shall see, in the way he fleshes out all the epistemological and hermeneutical consequences of such an infinity. If God encompasses all images, graven and holy, then idolatry is impossible when one is aware of the "actual situa- tion," for all images signify Him. An infinite God who encompasses all images also encompasses all interpretations; hence there is no interpretation of the Qur'an that God has not already understood and comprehended. Seen from the point of view of the Real, the endlessly diverse flow of manifes- tations is an effect of the Real itself, stamping its image upon the corporeal world with a different seal each time, infinitely and omnipresently. From the point of view of the believer, the Real is almost Protean in its movements, forever changing from one form to another, forever manifesting itself in different ways to different groups, while remaining untouched by any of them. If we can keep in mind this view of the Real as a constantly fluctuating source of manifestations, Ibn 'Arabi's dismissal of reason and rational thought as a "fetter" becomes clearer-like Derrida's preface, Reason fetters constant change, it constrains the Real from repeating itself in a dif- ferent way: In the view of the Verifiers, the Real is too exalted "to disclose Himself in a single form twice or to two individuals." The Real never repeats anything, because of His non- delimitation and the Divine Vastness, since repetition amounts to constraint (dhiq) and delimitation.32 To describe God is to restrict Him; to predicate his Essence is to constrain Him. Whoever practices theology, in effect, forces God to repeat Himself, again and again, imposing a banality and a predictability upon God that, Ibn 'Arabi clearly feels, is misplaced. Rational thought ('aql), the tool so treasured by the philosophers lan Almond 29</page><page sequence="9">of the Kalam (mutakallim) as a means to divine knowledge, becomes a way of fos- silizing God's dynamic flexibility. The Real, Whom no signifier can signify, Whom no sign can contain, immediately abandons any name or attribute that the philoso- phers attempt to nail to it, in substantia. The Shaykh is not against anyone naming one of God's attributes, providing they keep the utter unthinkability of the Real in mind. For Ibn 'Arabi, one could even make a distinction between 'authentic' and 'inauthentic' modes of speech concerning God. The authentic thinkers are the Veri- fiers, those who predicate names and attributes to God, but at the same time are aware that the Real has an infinite range of other names and attributes, too. 'lnau- thentic' thought would belong to those who, like the Ash'arites or the Mu'tazilites, fix their own rational/theological constructs onto God, to the exclusion of all other perspectives. Hence the accusation of idolatry (shirk) that Ibn 'Araby levels at the rational thinkers, who mistake their constructs for the Real. The mutakillim all attempt to fix a sign onto the Real, to tie it somehow to their own finite perspective; the possibility that the Real has no sign-that it only moves "from veil to veil"33-does not occur to them. Nor are they in the least disconcerted by the dizzying infinity of God, by the unfathomable reservoir of His forms and faces, which, if they were to realize it, would turn their doctrines from incontestable, overarching Truths into just another glimpse of an infinitely manifesting Divinity. In this depiction of Kalam as 'fettering' the infinite unrepeatability of God, Ibn 'ArabT seems to be entertaining the kind of fear to which both Maimonides and Meister Eckhart gave voice-the fear that people desire knowledge of God ultimately for their own worldly purposes. It is a familiar theme in the Guide for the Perplexed, where Maimonides chastises the sophists who "derive [from the scriptures] inferences and secondary conclusions" in order to exploit the "multitude who listen to these utterances."34 Eckhart also spoke of those who "want to see God with the same eyes with which they look at a cow.... [They] love it for the milk and the cheese and for their own profit."35 Such fears as the unpleasant speculation that all our theologies may be born not out of a humble desire to understand better the will of God and the limits of our own knowledge, but rather out of a will-to-power, a proprietary desire to familiarize and control something for our own self-aggrandizement, fuel Ibn 'ArabT's emphasis on the unknowability of the Essence: Were the Essence to make the loci of manifestation (mazahir) manifest, it would be known. Were It known, it would be encompassed (ihata). Were it encompassed, It would be limited (hadd). Were It limited, It would be confined (inhisar). Were It confined, It would be owned (mulk).36 Manifest-known-encompassed-limited-confined-owned. Ibn 'Arabl clearly sees a danger in too eagerly constructing sign systems about the Real-like the sign systems of the Ash'arites, which, not content with making observations about the various knowable manifestations of the Real (Allah, al-rabb, al-wahd, etc.), trespass beyond such manifestations and make claims about the Real itself.37 In this sense, Ibn 'ArabT's punning of 'aql (reason) with 'iqal (chains) becomes highly apt: when we 30 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="10">attempt to rationalize and speculate about God, we treat Him in the same way that we treat an animal that we want to chain and tame for our own use. One is reminded of the images of writing and zoology that Derrida playfully juggles with toward the end of Of Grammatology: "writing as zoography, as that painting of the living which stabilizes animality [fixant I'animalite]."38 The philosophers of the Kalam wish to do precisely this-'stabilize' the Protean unrepeatability of the Real, standardize the variety of its manifestations, equilibrate and control the unpredict- ability of its theophanies. How far any comparisons between Derrida's unrepeatability of the sign and Ibn 'Arabi's Real can be pushed remains a difficult question. We have already seen how the Real cannot repeat a sign because of the infinite store of its images; for Derrida, the unrepeatability has two, much more terrestrial reasons: the play of presences and absences within the text that renders it semantically unstable, and the infinite num- ber of different contexts outside the text that will forever change how it is read. In different places, Derrida has emphasized one or the other of these factors as a reason for the unrepeatability of the sign/text. Sometimes he stresses the undecidable play of oppositions within a text-what he calls "a determinate oscillation between possi- bilities," a feature he is careful to distinguish from "polysemia": "If polysemy is infinite, if it cannot be mastered as such, this is not because a finite reading or a finite writing cannot exhaust a superabundance of meaning."39 In other words, if Derrida's text is, like Ibn 'ArabT's al-haqq, "infinite," the reason for such unmaster- ability has nothing to do with the infinite imaginal richness of its 'deeper meanings', but rather is because of "a certain fold" (un certain pli)40 within the text, which forever fissures and doubles the text without repeating it. Derrida's debt to the Saussurean 'discovery' of the essentially differential nature of language-that sign systems 'work' not through any positive elements but only through differences, and hence that we only know what something is through what it is not-enables him to see texts as a bristling collection of forces, forever oscillating undecidably between various parameters of meaning. In other places, however, Derrida seems to connect the hermeneutic unrepeat- ability of a text with the uncertain future of its trajectory-the fact that no one can say who will appropriate the text or to what kind of use it will be put. Thus, "there are only contexts without any centre of absolute anchoring,"41 which accounts for the large number of wandering motifs in Derrida's work. The text wanders from reader to reader, its signs forever repeating themselves for different audiences with different results, acquiring a different meaning each time the context is changed. The impossibility of repetition for Derrida stems directly from the potentially infinite number of different contexts in which a text can be read and reread. All this seems a far cry from Ibn 'Arabi's infinitely differing zahir. If the Derridean text, to use Abu Talib al-Makki's words, "never discloses itself in a single form to two individuals, nor in a single form twice," such hermeneutic elasticity is certainly not the product of some vast, Neoplatonic sea of images. Probably because of its reli- gious resonances, Derrida has always been careful with the word "infinite," often preferring the synonym 'non-finite' instead. In Of Grammatology, we are warned of lan Almond 31</page><page sequence="11">the "profound unity among infinitist theology, logocentrism and a certain techni- cism";42 to infinitize God still remains a metaphysical gesture, for it fails to call into question the idea of presence or meaning. This idea of a "positive infinity"-a phrase Derrida uses in his essay on Levinas as a synonym for God43-does not face up to the genuine unthinkability of God but only infinitely defers it, producing no real critique of presence but only an infinite postponement of meaning. Hence Der- rida's refusal to connect the utter unpredictability of his text with a "superabundance of meaning"; far from any idea of plenitude, it is a certain emptiness beneath the text that allows it to double and differ without repeating itself. Nevertheless, it is difficult to say for sure whether Ibn 'Arabi's God-that is, his idea of the Real or Essence-can be so easily dismissed as just another one of the "infinitist theologies" that Derrida regards as a closet logocentrism. There are cer- tainly moments in the Fusus where Ibn 'Arabi's description of God resembles Derrida's description of the text as a constant play of forces, "producing a force of dislocation that spreads itself ... fissuring [the text] in every direction and thor- oughly delimiting it."44 In his chapter on the "Wisdom of Eminence in Moses," for example, Ibn 'ArabT gives a similar description of God as a life-giving chaos: [True] guidance means being guided to bewilderment, that he might know that the whole affair [of God] is perplexity, which means perturbation and flux, and flux is life. There is no abatement and no cessation, but all is being with no non-being.45 This is a picture of God quite different from the calm, unchanging, transcendental infinity of orthodox theology. As God is the source of all polarities-good and evil, immanence and transcendence, mercy and wrath-reaching Him produces a state of perplexity (hayrah) in the believer. Nevertheless, this is still a perplexity that pro- duces, a primordial confusion that allows order to come into being. To underline this, an analogy is made for God with water, whose unceasing course and flow allows all things to live and flourish: The same is the case with water by which the earth lives and moves, as in His saying and it quivers in its pregnancy, and swells in its bringing forth, and brings forth every joyous pair. (Ibid.)46 The idea of creation as a consequence of overflowing is typically Neoplatonic-we see it in authors as diverse as Plotinus ("the One is perfect and, in our metaphor, has overflowed and in its exuberance has produced the new" [V.2.1]) and Eckhart ("God overflows into all creatures, and yet he remains untouched by all"47). The word that Ibn 'Arabi uses for this is fayd, an effusion or radiation. The idea is of interest to us because Derrida also uses the same metaphor (d6border) to describe the way the oscillating, alternative meanings in a text 'spill over' their boundaries and bring a text to life: "If the play of meaning can overflow signification ... this overflow is the moment of the attempt to write" (si le jeu du sens peut deborder la signification ... ce debord est le moment du vouloir ecrire).48 In this use of d6b- order, which means literally to exceed a certain mark or boundary, Derrida is trying 32 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="12">to analyze the elusive moment of the act of writing-the moment when, as soon as the mark appears on the page, a multiplicity of meanings overflows the text and transforms it, giving life to new and various interpretations. Chaos and indeter- minacy, so to speak, give rise to various kinds of order, although how far this cor- responds to Ibn 'ArabT's divine, life-giving harakat and flux will be examined fur- ther on. The Impossibility of the Real: Simultaneous Immanence and Transcendence The topic of perplexity brings us to the third reason why, according to Ibn 'Arabi, the philosophers and theologians can make no proposition about the Real. Up to now, Ibn 'ArabT has been presented somewhat in the guise of a negative theologian: the three reasons why 'reflective thought' remains forever inadequate to representing the Real all involve a radically apophatic understanding of God as incomparable, infi- nite, and unrepeatable. Given Derrida's interest in negative theology, this is an aspect of Ibn 'ArabT's writing that will become increasingly important as we progress. To read Ibn 'ArabT as a negative theologian, in the manner of Eckhart and Dio- nysius, forever stressing the ultimate transcendence and unspeakability of God, makes sense in a certain way: it enables us to understand why the Shaykh criticizes positivist positions such as those of al-Ash'ari, the corporealists, or the Mushabbiha. However, such insistence on the unknowablility of God does not explain Ibn 'ArabT's objections to groups like the Mu'tazilites and the Mu'attila, groups who were equally keen to stress the radical ineffability of God. Far from offering any sympathy toward such positions, Ibn 'ArabT seems to include both positive and negative theologies (both Mu'tazilite and Ash'arite) in his dismissal of the ahl al-nazar or People of Reflection: However, the mistakes of the People of Reflection in the divine things (ilahiyyat) are more than their hitting the mark, whether they are philosophers, Mu'tazilites, Ash'arites or any other sort of the people of consideration.... [Philosophers] are blamed because they make errors in the knowledge of God by opposing the reports brought by the mes- sengers.49 In other words: Ibn 'Arabi's objection against the People of Reflection is not neces- sarily a theological objection-a disagreement with a certain school of thought over a certain issue or the interpretation of a certain verse, something that would require the taking of a position or the elaboration of a doctrine. The philosophers of the Kalam, quite regardless of whatever their own positions are on the eternity of the Qur'an or the attribute(lessness) of God, are guilty of a much more funda- mental error-that of limiting God to only one half of a dualism. When Ibn 'Arabi criticizes the Mu'tazilites and Ash'arites together, he is criticizing two opposite poles of a very familiar debate-that of the knowability of God. One pole emphasizes the absolute transcendence (tanzih) of God, the other His immanence, but neither have understood the actual situation-that the Real can actually be both at the same time: Ian Almond 33</page><page sequence="13">If you insist only on His transcendence, you restrict Him, And if you insist only on His immanence you limit Him. If you maintain both aspects you are right, An Imam and a master in the spiritual sciences. Whoso would say He is two things is a polytheist, While the one who isolates Him tries to regulate Him. Beware of comparing Him if you profess duality, And, if unity, of making Him transcendent. You are not He and you are He and You see Him in the essences of things both boundless and limited.50 To say that God can be two different things at the same time is impossible-and it is precisely this possibility of the impossible, the idea of God as an experience with the impossible, that the thinkers of the Kalam have failed to take into account. In the Tahafut al-Falasifah (The incoherence of the philosophers), al-GhazalT cites this very idea of a simultaneous affirmation and negation ('A is both black and white') as an impossibility that falls within the Law of Contradiction.51 From a deconstructive angle, Ibn 'Arabi's insistence on the simultaneity of everything being He/not He (huwa la huwa) is an important step: it acknowledges the illusion of the dualism, the fundamental mistake of believing God to be either 'this' or 'that', transcendent or immanent, 'out there' or 'in here'. As long as rational thought conceives of God in terms of binary oppositions, "opposing the reports brought by the messengers" in order to establish 'true' knowledge of God, then "reflection can only roam in its own specific playing field (maydan), which is one of many fields."52 Because of its com- mittal to a simplistic, logocentric law of identity ('Is God X or Y?'), reflective thought finds itself a priori unable to grasp the true complexity of God. Moreover, in observing how "the one who isolates Him tries to regulate Him," Ibn 'Arabi seems to anticipate Derrida's own reasons for his objections to binary thought: namely, that whenever two terms are opposed to one another (spirit/flesh, nature/culture, speech/ writing), a hierarchy always ensues; one half of the term is artificially privileged over the other for ultimately ideological purposes. Ibn 'Arabi seems to be prefiguring this-the Ash'arites will privilege 'immanence' over 'transcendence' in order to jus- tify their own versions of God. "From the moment there is meaning," writes Derrida, "there are nothing but signs" (II n'y a donc que des signes des lors qu'il y a du sens).53 Once again, the danger arises of assuming analogous gestures to be identical ones. Both Ibn 'Arabi and Derrida reject binary thought as illusory and, at worst, potentially tyrannical. Whether their objections stem from a common source remains to be seen. Derrida sees binary oppositions as illusions because of a certain semantic emptiness-signs forever need their opposites in order to define themselves negatively. For Derrida, then, to believe in a word like 'transcendence' is to believe in a certain absence. 'Transcendence' and 'immanence' are semantic vacuities that can only pretend to meaning through contrast with their opposites-in other words, the immanent can only be understood as the non-transcendent, the transcendent as the non-immanent. Ibn 'ArabT, however, is making no such critique of meaning; the passage above from 34 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="14">the Fusus is not questioning whether signifiers like 'transcendent' and 'immanent' can ever lead to anything other than signifiers. Ibn 'Arabi still believes in the positive, independent signification of such words, and he still believes these meanings to be opposed to one another. However, it is an opposition that is dissolved in the Real. Ibn 'Araby believes in a God paradoxical enough, all-comprehensive enough, impossible enough to be both immanent and transcendent at the same time. If Der- rida rejects binary oppositions because they veil an absence, Ibn 'ArabT resents the dualism because it veils a presence-the presence of a paradox, the ultimate, unthinkable Oneness of God. It remains the object of another study to see whether it is possible to re-describe this situation in different terms-that is, whether the Oneness of God so central to Ibn 'ArabT's thought is just another logocentric moment of infinite self-presence, or whether such a "negation of negations" actually moves closer to the Derridean oeuvre than anyone could suspect. For now, it is sufficient merely to underline how Ibn 'Araby sees beneath what we call 'God' something infinite enough, uncontrol- lable enough, paradoxical enough to recontextualize and ultimately undermine everything we try to sing, say, or scribble about Him.
