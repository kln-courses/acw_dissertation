<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Other End of the Egg: Religious Satire in "Gulliver's Travels." By MARTIN KALLICH. Bridgeport, Conn.: Conference on British Studies at the University of Bridgeport, 1970. Pp. ix + 119. This book is the outgrowth of an article, "Three Ways of Looking at a Horse: Jonathan Swift's 'Voyage to the Houyhn- hnms' Again" (Criticism 2 [1960]: 107-24), in which Mr. Kallich argued that the fourth book of Gulliver's Travels should be read as a religious satire. The article will be remem- bered by many readers for having been the occasion, along with a similar article by another writer, for a well-known review by R. S. Crane (Philological Quarterly 40 [1961]: 427-30) which pointed out that "the argument in both essays is of that very com- mon type, in studies of this sort, that begins by positing a particular principle or 'context of interpretation' as peculiarly 'proper' or appropriate, on a priori grounds, to the text under consideration and then proceeds to confirm its relevance by construing selected details of the text in conformity with its demands" (p. 427). Kallich refers the reader to this review in several notes (pp. 96 and 111), but apparently he does not take seriously Crane's objections to his mode of argument, for he makes no attempt to answer him and, besides reprinting the greater part of this earlier article in the fourth chapter of the present book, he now has used precisely the same method in construing selected details from the other three books of Gulliver's Travels to confirm his thesis that the entire work is a "profoundly religious satire" (p. 11). Undoubtedly, Kallich would object to this characterization of his method and would point to the inductive procedure he promises at the outset of his study: "Objectivity in this area of discussion of Gulliver's Travels is therefore most desirable. We must accumu- late all the facts dealing with the question. Once this task is accomplished without prejudice, then and only then can we legiti- mately ascertain the meaning of the religious content of the Travels and make a reliable assessment of its substance and its impact</page><page sequence="2">166 BOOK REVIEWS upon an impartial reader" (p. 8). The senti- ments are unexceptionable, but the unpre- judiced accumulation of facts never takes place. Instead of facts we are offered strained interpretations of the text, prejudiced by Kallich's assumption, frequently repeated, that the author of the Travels, as a practicing clergyman of the Church of Ireland, had an "irresistible compulsion" to introduce reli- gious concerns into his satire (pp. 47, 48, 53, 90-91). The extent to which a prejudiced reading of the Travels-what Kallich ingenuously refers to on one occasion as "examining the work from this special point of view" (p. 7)- is necessary to his thesis is indicated by his way of classifying Swift's readers. Most twentieth-century readers of Gulliver's Tra- vels, as Kallich concedes, have detected only the slightest allusions there to religion. They are "misled," "unaware," "completely obli- vious" (p. 84), "insensitive" to certain aspects of religion, or so completely "secular in their orientation" that they are blind to "the religious man with whom they are unable to identify" (p. 8). On the other hand, those eighteenth-century writers and critics who detected religious concerns in the Travels win their laurels as "extremely sensitive" readers (pp. 6, 7). These include the authors of such imitations of the Travels as the Memoirs of Lilliput and A Voyage to Cacklogallinia, who apparently were "inspired by [their] reading of Gulliver's Travels to write a chapter of religious satire," suggesting to Kallich that "a religious reading of the Travels was certainly not impossible" (pp. 4-5); critics hostile to Swift, such as Jonathan Smedley, Edward Young, and James Beattie, who attacked the Travels as irreligious (pp. 5-6, 67-70); and Swift's defenders, such as Deane Swift, W. H. Dilworth, and Thomas Sheridan who, forced to answer his critics on their own terms, insisted that the book contained sound religion and unimpeachable morality (pp. 7, 64-67). In this class of Swift's defenders, Kallich surprisingly includes the anonymous author of Gulliver Decypher'd, a caustic satire against Queen Anne's Tory ministers and the members of the Scriblerus Club by means of a burlesque of A Tale of a Tub in which Peter, Martin, and Jack represent Pope, Swift, and Arbuthnot, and where the usual scurrilities are repeated: Pope is "a little deformed cross-grained fellow," Swift an ambitious seeker after church preferment, and Arbuthnot a quack who has wormed his way into favor as Harley's "pot-companion." Yet the author of this satire is now pressed into service as a defender of Swift's who offered "evidences of his belief" that "the author of the Travels did have religious ideals in mind" (pp. 17-18, 43). Some examples drawn from Kallich's dis- cussion of the first three books of Gulliver's Travels will indicate the extent to which his selection and use of details is governed, not by "objectivity," but by a wish to confirm the relevance of his thesis. He employs three methods for achieving this purpose. The first is that of constructing a definition of religion at the outset which is so broad that it includes not only the beliefs and modes of worship of all religions but also ecclesiastical matters, the relations between church and state, civil laws concerning the exercise of religion, wars and diplomacy affected by religious differ- ences between nations, ethical ideals and norms, and codes of conduct (pp. 8-10). On these terms there is scarcely an item of what has traditionally been described as Swift's political and moral satire in the first three books that cannot be assimilated under the rubric of religion. Second, Kallich sifts the text of the first three books for whatever references to religion he can find there, however slight these may be, and supplies them with an emphasis for which there is no internal justification. A notable example is his dis- cussion of the conversation between Gulliver and the King of Brobdingnag about the state of England in which the king, having ques- tioned Gulliver extensively about the two houses of Parliament, the courts of justice, the management of the treasury, the diver- sions of the nobility and gentry, and the history of their wars and rebellions, at length declares: "I cannot but conclude the Bulk of your Natives, to be the most pernicious Race</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 167 of little odious Vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl upon the Surface of the Earth." Ignoring the numerous other details enumerated by Gulliver, Kallich selects the two which have some reference to religion-- the "several Sects among us in Religion and Politicks" and the venality of the bishops-- and treats these as the principal basis of the king's reproof. "When the structure of religion is [so?] almost hopelessly split by dissent as to destroy the peace and stability of the state," he writes, "when those pre- sumably who should be considered among the most morally honorable and righteous, the holy lords or bishops, are thus infected by sin, the disgusted king cannot help con- cluding his diatribe against Gulliver's native land with his celebrated remarks. . . . At this point, the satire, overcharged with hostility, and much too defensive, much too harsh, much too abrasive for the condition to which it is a reaction, loses its high-minded quality of reasonable persuasiveness, and argues hysteria and despair. Swift's profound com- mitment to the religious ideals-here in the sixth chapter described as being utterly frustrated-undoubtedly contributed to the satiric compulsion and this pathological reaction" (p. 47). Last, Kallich attaches to details in the first three books an arbitrary religious significance for which there is no warrant in Swift's narrative. Thus, the "ancient Temple, es- teemed to be the largest in the whole King- dom" assigned to Gulliver during his residence in Lilliput "must not be considered only an empty building large enough to house Gulliver" but should be seen as "a pro- foundly significant anticipatory irony" point- ing to the religious satire of the first book (pp. 13-14). Again, the fact that Gulliver, when he is seized by the gigantic farmer at the beginning of his second adventure, places his "Hands together in a supplicating Posture" and begs mercy of his captor signifies to Kallich a prayerful attitude indicating that Gulliver has "some glimmerings of religion" (p. 37). When in the voyage to Laputa Gulliver describes a king and his court who inhabit a flying island remote from the subjects they govern and who are so intent on the study of music and mathematics that they ignore the petitions they receive from below, we might conclude that Swift is sug- gesting that these rulers are guilty of in- attention to the business of government. But Kallich finds that "in his satire, Swift is only telling us that science possesses its share of ignorance and that, paradoxically, when in its excesses science denies reason and religion, it simply fosters absurd idolatry. Thus in Laputa Swift indicts superstitious scientists who suffer a kind of moral and religious paralysis" (p. 51). Kallich employs a different method of con- struing details to fit his thesis when he comes to the fourth voyage where, by his own admission, Gulliver's description of Houyhn- hnmland includes no references to religion (pp. 59-60). Here his argument depends on a false analogy between the Houyhnhnms and the English deists, the logic of which assumes that vague resemblance amounts to wholesale identity. The deists, we are told, rejected supernatural religion and the Houyhnhnms have none (pp. 74-77); the deists rejected revealed morality and the Houyhnhnms have none (pp. 77-79); the deists denied Christ to be the sole savior of mankind and the Houyhnhnms do not believe in him (pp. 79- 81); the deists were anticlerical and the Houyhnhnms have no clergy (pp. 81-83). "In short, as symbols of his religious irony, the horses could only represent deists; and, as we well know, Swift detested the deists of his day" (p. 74). Let us accept for a moment Kallich's dubious assumption that a religious context is relevant to the description of the Houy- hnhnms and ask what possible resemblance these creatures bear to the deists. Was Socrates a deist ? Are the Hottentots ? Insofar as the term "deists" can have any historical meaning at all it refers to a specific group who, whatever their nationality or individual differences, were inhabitants of a Christian country, explicitly rejected the supernatural religion of their countrymen, and (as opposed to atheists) espoused a purely natural religion in its stead. The Houyhnhnms, on the other</page><page sequence="4">168 BOOK REVIEWS hand, like all the others whom Gulliver visits on his travels, are inhabitants of a land where the Gospel has never been preached; they are therefore incapable of rejecting what they have never known or of having "effectively 'abolished Christianity"' (p. 83), which has never reached their shores. In the absence of any mention of their religion, moreover, it is scarcely possible to infer that they possessed any, natural or otherwise, much less to describe their "religious views and practices" (p. 74) or to declare that they "cannot tolerate miracles or mysteries in their religion" and "distrust the supernatural" (p. 76). It there- fore exceeds all belief to be told that "Swift as a high churchman would have sensed heresy in the horses' religion" (pp. 74, 80). High churchman or low churchman, Swift would never have passed his ordination examination if he had been incapable of distinguishing between a heretic and an infidel, or if he had assumed that those who live in invincible ignorance of the Gospel are to be condemned because they are not trinitarians (p. 76), do not believe in the Redemption and the Resurrection (p. 78), and "neglect to worship" Christ (p. 82). These are "chiefly Matters of Fact, and con- sequently of Faith," Swift pointed out in his Letter to a Young Gentleman Lately Entered into Holy Orders. "And therefore in this Point, nothing can be justly laid to the Charge of the [Heathen] Philosophers; further, than that they were ignorant of certain Facts which happened long after their Death" (Prose Works, ed. Herbert Davis [Oxford, 1939-68], 9:73). Admittedly, the clergyman who passes for Swift in Kallich's account would be capable of condemning any infidels, ancient or modern, for their ignorance of these matters. His Swift is not the author of the "Thoughts on Religion" who wrote: "I am in all opinions to believe according to my own impartial reason; which I am bound to inform and improve, as far as my capacity and opportunities will permit" (ibid., 9:261). Instead, he is a "fundamentalist" who "did not accept common sense in matters of faith," "opposed the deistic [and orthodox ?] notion of the reasonableness of Christianity," "particularly did not wish to test religious doctrine by subjecting it to the scrutiny of reason," and "had the orthodox church divine's conventional scepticism of reason" (p. 75). In short, he was an intolerant "re- ligious totalitarian" whose comments at times suggest "fanaticism" (p. 82). But even if we were to accept this description, more appropriate to Samuel How the cobbler- preacher, as an accurate portrayal of Jona- than Swift, we should still wonder at the complete absence of internal consistency in his religious satire. For this fanatic who con- demns the Houyhnhnms because "they have neither gospel nor sacraments" (p. 78) is presumably the same author who offered the Brobdingnagians, a "polytheistic and pagan" people, as religious models for the English (p. 48), whose "religious message" in the second voyage is marked by "the great im- portance given a commonsense or rational morality, irrespective of the abstractions of speculative theology and any differences in dogma" (p. 49), and who "informs us" in the first voyage "that the principles of religion ought to be established according to the norms of reason and common sense" (p. 35). What is most questionable about Kallich's interpretation of the fourth voyage, however, is his assumption that a religious context, permitting a discussion of the Houyhnhnms as either heretics or infidels, is in any way .relevant to Swift's satire. It is an assumption based on an implied definition of the Houy- hnhnms as human horses. How else are we to account for his criticism of these creatures for not worshiping "an anthropomorphic God" (p. 60), having no sense of sin (p. 79), and not fearing the torments of hell (p. 78)? Not even Samuel How would have required religion where he found no humanity or expected a concern with the afterlife among creatures with mortal souls. When Kallich argues that Swift's horses are "'fallen' and sinful creatures" who are in need of "redemption by Christ" (p. 80), he must assume that as descendants of Adam they have inherited the legacy of Original Sin. Indeed, he attempts to prove on two occasions that the horses share</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 169 in the Fall because they are subject to death (pp. 59, 80), an inconvenience borne by other animals who are not thought to require a redeemer, and which could be a relevant detail only on the assumption that Swift's horses are a part of Adam's progeny differing from other men in their "outer figure" (p. 84). Yet this assumption is contradicted at every turn by Swift's text, which repeatedly associates humanity exclusively with the Yahoos in contrasting them with the Houyhnhnms. It is thus that Gulliver de- scribes the Houyhnhnms as "a Race of Mortals who were already too apt to conceive the vilest Opinion of Human Kind," that he declares "I ought to have understood human Nature much better than I supposed it possible for my Master to do," and that he finds the Houyhnhnms incapable of dis- tinguishing pride "for want of thoroughly understanding Human Nature." It is thus also that he speaks of "the many Virtues of those excellent Quadrupeds placed in opposite View to human Corruptions," tells us that "I entered on a firm Resolution never to return to human Kind," and when he is forced to do so, learns only by degrees "to tolerate the Sight of a human Creature," since "when I thought of my Family, my Friends, my Countrymen, or human Race in general, I considered them as they really were, Yahoos in Shape and Disposition." On these terms, the Houyhnhnms are presented purely and simply as "rational Creatures," differing in this single respect from other horses, and possessing neither the bodies, the immortal souls, nor the fallen nature of "human Kind." For the purpose of his satire, Swift asks us to imagine a fabulous land in which humanity and rationality are totally separated, in which there exist both a human species completely devoid of reason and a nonhuman species possessed of perfect reason, and then to witness the unwelcome conclusions about his own supposedly rational kind which an ordinary human being would be driven to accept as a result of beholding genuine reason unencumbered by any association with humanity. We may object that the notion of nonhuman rationality contradicts our own experience, conclude that Swift's account is "full of improbable lies," and side with the Irish bishop who declared that "for his part, he hardly believed a word of it." We may even think that Swift could have written a better book if he had produced a religious satire peopled with deists bearing a strong physical resemblance to horses. But at least we ought to respect Swift's artistic integrity enough to leave him what he has written. PHILLIP HARTH University of Wisconsin</page></plain_text>
