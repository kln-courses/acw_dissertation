<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORTHODOX ATTITUDES TOWARDS TEMPLE SERVICE AND IMAGE WORSHIP IN ANCIENT INDIA by HEINRICH VON STIETENCRON Tübingen As yet we have no precise knowledge of the circumstances which induced parts of the Aryan ruling class to start worshipping im- ages of gods. Nor do we know much about the social background, the relative importance in society and the numerical strength of those Aryans who turned towards the worship of images slightly prior to the middle of the 1st millennium B.C. Yet this was an innovation which proved to be important not only in the sphere of religion. It also opened new possibilities for the development of art which gradually began to prosper as a result of the promotion it now received from members of the Aryan society. The process of change from the Vedic altar to the Hindu temple and from the moving celestials to stationary images was accom- panied by bitter feuds between traditionalists and innovators. Orthodox Vedic Brahmins were furiously opposed to the new popular trends in religion. They also fought relentlessly against the new type of priests who were in charge of the temples and their images, who organized processions of the deity through the vil- lage street and treated the deity in analogy to a human king. In a later period these priests became known as sevakas, the servants of god. But they had to struggle for centuries against the social discrimination which they experienced from the orthodox Brah- mans. The reasons for the controversy can certainly not be reduced to a cast conflict. It was not merely a question of defence of Brah- manic privileges against a new group of religious specialists rising from lower strata of society. The texts rather suggest that the conflict was mainly within the Brahman class. It raised much bitterness because solid economic interests were at stake. But its basis was religious : the new trend involved a change in the concept</page><page sequence="2">ORTHODOX ATTITUDES TOWARDS TEMPLE SERVICE 127 of god, a shift in moral values, and a different accessment of the role of the priest. The early Aryan mode of worship was not in need either of an image or a temple. A place suitable for sacrifice was carefully chosen, the ground was cleared, levelled out, ritually purified and covered with a layer of kusa grass as a seat for the deity. A fire was kindled, the sacrificial animal was prepared or soma was pressed. Then the priest-poet invoked the god that he might come to partake of the offerings and grant victory, cattle, wealth, children or long life in return. Attracted by the smell of the sacrifice and by the very power of the priests invoking chant, the god would come from afar, swiftly moving across the air, and settle down at the place of sacrifice wherever it was. The only major difficulty in securing the god's presence arose if more than one sacrifice was offered to the same god at the same time in different places. There was danger inherent in such situation especially if Aryans fought against each other and competition arose in the effort to secure the help of the gods. Then it depended on the skill of the poet-priest, on the magic power of his chant of praise and on the flawlessness of the ritual whether the deity could be persuaded to disregard the offerings of another yajamãna and to come to the place of sacrifice without allowing his chariot to stop at the sacrifice of the enemy.1 The power to secure the presence and benevolence of the god was thus with the priest. This marked the beginning of a long peroid of ever-growing priestly influence in the Aryan community which was hardly disputed before the period of the Upanisads. Outside the small Vedic fold there existed other forms of worship. We do not know how early idol-worship was included among those forms. The numerous findings from pre- Aryan settlements of the Indus valley civilization do not prove the use of anthropomorphic images as cult objects. And of the post-Harappan indigenous population prior to about 800 A.D. too little is known to form any reliable picture of their religion.2 It is only from the period of the 1 RV. 2,18,3; 3,43,2; 4,29,1; etc. 2 The Vedic terms éišnadeva and müradeva are not very clear. A šišnaaeva has been taken as somebody whose god is a phallus. In the word müradeva the Indian tradition relates the first part mūra to mūļa (Kāšikā on Panini 8,2,18) or mūdha (Säyana). Wackernagel connects it with German 'Maul' (Kleine Schriften I, 1953, p. 329sq.). If derived from a root mūr: to coagulate, stiffen (variant of mūrch , mūrchati without sk-Infix) and connected to mūrti:</page><page sequence="3">128 HEINRICH YON STIETENCRON Kalpa-sütras onwards that we can prove the existence of temples as permanent residence of certain deities.8 They were referred to as devakula , devãyatana or devägära, all denoting a house of god in contrast to the chariot ( ratha , vimāna) of the Vedic celestials. Names of the deities are not mentioned. Nor do the texts say any- thing about the mode of worship in these shrines. But their attitude towards these shrines is not yet antagonistic. On the contrary, they demand respectful behaviour in regard to idols and temples. They also refer to the sending of gifts to them. And they prove that the temples were regarded with awe or considered as pure and sacred, as some examples from the Grhya-sutras indicate. The Mãnava Grhya-sütra states that the girl to be chosen as a bride should be examined in a temple (devãgara)4, and according to the Kāthaka Grhya-sütra the branch of a sacred tree which is given to the girl on occasion of a ceremony prior to her wedding should be thrown either in a reservoir of standing water or into a pure temple.6 A student who observes the mahānāmnī vrata , i.e., a vow of fasting which he has to undergo before studying certain Ãranyaka texts,6 is advised by Šankhāyana to fast in a temple (devakula) in the forest or at a place where agnihotra is performed,7 thereby implying that the two places are equally suitable for the purpose. Both èankhãyana and Gautama ordain that a snãtaka , a man whose religious training with the guru is successfully ended, should pass by the temples of gods ( devãyatana ) with his right side turned to- wards them,8 giving thus an early example of pradaksiņa around temples. And Päraskara says that if riding on a chariot a man approaches the residence of a god ( devatã ) he should get down from the chariot before reaching the deity.9 It appears from the last three of these statements that not only the temple in one's own village was held sacred, but other temples stiff body, form, the word mūra might mean: rigid, stiff, immovable. Müra- deva could designate those "whose gods are immovable" (Bahuvrïhi with accent on first member) or "immovable gods" (Tatpuruça, as the form müradevin in Paippalāda Samhitā suggests), in both cases referring to images. 3 Ram Gopal, India of Vedic Kalpasütras, Delhi 1959, p. 475f. 4 Man.

The same applies to caityas also to which the sūtras as well as Buddhist and Jain texts frequently refer. Sacrifices to the deity in a caitya were sometimes sent even from distant vil- lages. In that case provisions were made that the messenger who carries the sacrifice will reach the shrine of the god safely. He carries the finda (a ball of cooked rice) offerings with a carrying pole and receives a piņda for himself as food supply for the journey. If there is any danger suspected on the road, the messenger receives a weapon to defend himself, and if a river is to be crossed, a boat or raft may be provided for him. Interestingly, this messenger may be replaced by a leal of the ņalāsa- tree, sent as a symbolic messenger to carry the bali offering to the caitya. Symbolically, the leaf messenger (palāsa-dūta) is provided with the same equipment.10 While this passage from the Ãsvalãyana Grhya-sutra refers to offerings oí cooked rice, the Pāraskara Grhya-sütra contains a similar arrangement for the transport of an animal sacrifice.11 This practice betrays a marked digression from Vedic conceptions. The deity does no longer come to the place of sacrifice in order to receive his share of the sacrificial animal or the cooked food. Nor does the god stay in heaven, where the uprising flames of Agni used to carry the oblation for all celestials. Instead, a messenger - whether symbolic or not, but other than Agni - has to carry the offering to a different place on earth if it is to reach the god. New realities of religion have forced the age old vertical mediatorship of Agni to be replaced by the horizontal one of the (symbolic) messen- ger : the latter has become necessary because the god has now taken his residence in an image which is permanently installed in a shrine somewhere at a distance from the village. But the change towards later temple worship is not yet fully accomplished. These passages represent an intermediary stage where it is still possible to offer at home a gift and dispatch it symbolically to a deity residing else- where. This is no more possible in a later period when it becomes essential for the worshipper to meet the god personally. He does so either by going to the temple himself - if necessary on a long pilgrimage- or by worshipping him in a small idol which is installed in the house itself. One of the most important early informations about images and 10 Äsv. Gr. S. 1.12,1-6. 11 Pār. Gr.

The sūtra (V. 3. 99: jwikãrthe câpanye) is intended to regulate the formation of the names of divine images. To some of them the suffix -ka is added, to others not ; and with the latter deals this sūtra. From the commentators we know that Pāņini' s rule is based on a distinction between images which were meant for sale and others which were worshipped and cared for by custodians called devalaba. The rule applies to the latter. These images can be either fixed in a shrine (acala) or carried from place to place (cala). In both cases they are meant for worship (pūjārtha) and are a source of livelihood (jīvilcā) to their custodians who receive the giits of the devotees. The devalabas show the images and act as pūjarīs , but they do not sell them: their images are not for sale (apanya). Such images, according to Pāņini , would be named as ¡Šiva or Skanda, without suffix -ka. Opposed to these are images which were displayed for sale. They too were a means of livelihood for their owners, but these owners kept them only for trade and not for the sake of worship (pujãrtha). Such images would be called Šivaka or Skandaka. This linguistic distinction shows that at the time of the famous grammarian there existed people who earned their living as servants of images of gods. And the names of gods directly connected with images or temples in Pāņini and his successors up to Patañjali in the second century B.C. ar e Šiva and Vaisrāvaņa (who is also called Mahārāja,12 Kubera and Dhanapati), Skanda , Samkarsaņa or Rāma , and Vāsudeva or Kesava.lz But neither Indra nor Agni or Varuna and none of the Âdityas is mentioned in connection with images in human form or with temples at this period. It is obvious that the change had not affected essentially the worship of Vedic gods. The petrified rules of their ritual, anxiously guarded by the Brahman priests, rendered them inflexible and unresponsive to new needs of the people. The new mode of worship, therefore, was introduced together with new gods. The change which occurred was essentially one on the emotional level. The ideal of bhakti which found expression in the Švetāsvatara Upanisad and the Bhagavadgīta and implied a devotional approach to a personal god became more and more important. This personal god was not merely propitiated by ritual and sacrifice, nor was he 12 Pan. 4.2.35; Pat. 1.388. 13 Pat. 1.436; Vaisãkha and Skanda (Mahāsena, Brahmanya) can be added from archaeological evidence.</page><page sequence="6">ORTHODOX ATTITUDES TOWARDS TEMPLE SERVICE 131 forced to act on the basis of the primordial correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm. None of these aspects was fully rejected, but the new effort to establish an emotional link with the deity by means of self-surrender and love was considered more important and more rewarding. The god himself was ready to answer these feelings and to bestow his grace upon his followers. He graciously allowed his devotees to see him, he manifested himself permanently in human form and was there for everybody to be approached and honoured and spoken to and asked for help or special boons. For the Vedic Brahman the permanent presence of a god in his image implied danger. As stated before, his powerful position in society had been based precisely on the absence of the gods and in his exclusive ability to call them and secure their help. The per- manent presence of the deity in an image and his free accessibility for all devotees was an open threat to the Vedic priest's social position. The Brahmans therefore resented this development. But they could not hinder the rapidly increasing popularity of the devotional approach. It proved much more attractive than the sophisticated ritual of the brahmaņas and seemed to offer a path to salvation which appeared easier and required less spiritual or material prerequisites than jnãnamãrga, the path of philosophical knowledge, or karmamãrga , the path of sacrifice and ritual. Many people therefore turned to bhalctimārga , the path of devotion, and sought refuge at the feet of one or the other increasingly powerful popular gods. It was under the challenge of the loss of their clientele that a schism took place within the Brahman class. Part of them thought it wise to acknowledge temple cults along with the major new gods and tried to integrate them into the Brahmanic religious system. This implied the necessity of taking over important functions in the temple service by the Brahmans ; it also implied the recognition of the fact that all castes from Brahmans to Šūdras could worship the same god. This was a first and decisive concession to the Šūdras whose complete exclusion from the religion of the upper class could now no more be enforced. The more orthodox Brahmans were strictly against these conces- sions. They continued to consider temple service and image worship as inferior religious activities adequate only for Šūdras and for low people bereft of proper knowledge. To them the religious barriers which separated the three upper casts from the Šūdras seemed</page><page sequence="7">132 HEINRICH YON STIETENCRON absolutely indispensable. And they started a bitter feud against their more compromising colleagues. They turned their back with disgust on those Brahmans who lent themselves for services in temples. Full of contempt they applied to them the same word devalaka which had been used for the Šūdra custodians of images before. And they considered these priests as patita , i.e. fallen from the rank of the Brahman to that of a Šūdra which also implied that they were apãnkteya, i.e. unfit to eat in company with honourable Brahmans.14 The temple priests retorted by boldly declaring that the mere sight of the image of god was worth more than a hundred Vedic sacrifices. In their devaluation of Vedic sacrifices the ideal of ahimsā played an important role16 which was directed mainly against the slaughter of sacrificial animals and was particularly emphazised by the worshippers of Nãrãyana. Therefore similar statements or statements comparing the results of visiting a temple with those of aévamedha sacrifice recur frequently in the Purāņas and in the Mahãbhãrata in connection with the praise of sacred places (tirtha) and the propagation of bhakti. Even the Vedas, the agnihotra and sacrifices rich in fees are not worth a 16th part of the prostration with bhakti in front of the deity.16 Certainly, the continued and bitter polemics against temple priests were partly rooted in a growing jealousy which was prompted by the rapid accumulation of wealth in those temples. It had been customary all along to offer gifts to Brahmans and some such gifts were rather generous as can be seen from the various enumerations of daksiņas in Vedic literature.17 Large donations to certain religious orders are also known as for instance in Buddhist history. But with the rising popularity of temples and images there arose a completely new situation. Now the god himself, visibly manifest in his image, was actually residing in a terrestrial abode. Now he himself could be the receiver of donations, he himself could be the owner and guardian of his treasures. The former awkward situation that greedy Brahmans18 had to be presented with gifts for their services 14 SP. 26,20-23; BhP. I, 139,4-6; I, 139,21. 15 R. G.

Jolly, Recht und Sitte , 1896, p. 104-105; MBh. 3.82,255; 14,3-10; etc. 18 The greedy Brahman is a well known topic in Indian literature and the</page><page sequence="8">ORTHODOX ATTITUDES TOWARDS TEMPLE SERVICE 133 was now to a large extent removed. Not the priest, but the god did receive the gift, and this, of course, promised to produce much better results. For whoever added to the deity's fame by offering richer gifts, or by building temples more splendid than those of other rival gods, could be sure of winning the deity's favour and of gaining heavenly rewards. Consequently, more and richer donations of land, cattle or gold were made to the god in the temple than to any of the orthodox Brahmans. Moreover, the number of potential and actual donors had increased considerably, for now it included not only members of the three upper classes but the whole lowcaste population also, some of whom had become well-to-do people by means of trade. The temple priests, in whose hands the administration of the deity's property lay, would not only live on it comfortably but also use it to carry out costly rituals or to organize splendid festivals in honour of the deity. The temple's big sacrifice or religious festival would attract increasing number of pilgrims and devotees whose gifts would more than cover the expenses. And by the end of the festival both the god's fame and the temple's treasures would have greatly increased. Additional functions of the temple also added to its prestige. Money and jewellery could be deposited there in times of danger. The temple became a place of relative security for refugees and some of the major temples became centres of cultural life. The orthodox were excluded from this wave of success. Their growing jealousy served to intensify the controversy and found its expression in the Mahäbhärata, in the Smrtis and in the Purāņas. The Manu-smrti19 and its commentators reflect the orthodox view very clearly. The devalabas are there defined as persons who live on the god's treasures: devalcoéopabhojî ca nāmnā devalako bhavet.20 While serving the image they take for themselves the food which was offered to the god. In fact, they continue to be what they used to be at the time of Pāņini : professional worshippers who carry out the service of the image jívikãrtham , i.e. as a means of earning their livelihood. And it is precisely this what they are constantly passage in Chãndogya Upaniçad 1,12,1-5 may represent an early persiflage of them. On greedy Brahmans in the Jātakas see R.

They are bitterly accused to offer their religious services for money, just like physicians, shopkeepers and meat-sellers do. They ought to be kept away from offerings to gods and pitrs. Thus Manu says in chapter III, 152: cikitsakã devalakä māmsavikragiņas tathāj vipaņena ca jîvanti varjyãh syur havyakavyayohj / and the commentary of Kullūka on the word devalaka even alleges that they serve their deities not for the sake of religion, but solely for the sake of profit : devalakah pratimāparicārakah , vartanārthatvenaitat karma kurvato 'yam nisedho na tu dharmārtham / 2 1 The Bhavisya Purāņa even contains a warning that if a devalaka Brahman conducts the rites of purification of a deceased person ( samskāra ) he gets hold of all the pitrs and throws them down head first.22 These verses reflect the attempt of the traditionalists to keep at least one domain of general importance lor themselves and to pre- vent the temple priests from interfering in srāddha and samskāra rites. Therefore they continue to pillory the meanness and criminal behaviour of their rivals whom they accuse of robbing the god's own property out of sheer greed by using it for their own purposes. Sinners they are and their acts are so impure that they are equal or even worse than vultures : their punishment in the other world will be to feed oil the remnants left over by vultures : devasvam brãhmanasvam vã lobhenopahinasti yah' sa pāpātmā pare loke grdhrocchistena jivatiH2* According to the traditionslists' view it is also an offence of theft of the god's property when that property is used for ritual purposes. For such expenses it is allowed to use brãhmanasvam , the property which has been donated to Brahmans. It is not allowed to use devasvam , the property which has been given to the god. This regulation is meant to counteract and to declare as unlawful the above-mentioned possibility of rich temples to increase their prestige by the performance of big sacrifices. Particularly striking cases of such sacrifices are directly prohibited, as for instance in the 21 Kullūka on Manu 3.152. 22 BhP. I. 139,22: dvi jo devalako yasya samskāram samprayacchatij so ' dhomukhān pitřn sarvãn ãkramya vinipãtayetl / 23 Manu 11.26; (BhP. I, 139,7; SP. 26.24). The commentary of Kullūka for the word devasvam is: pratimādidevatārtham utsrstam dhanam devasvam I</page><page sequence="10">ORTHODOX ATTITUDES TOWARDS TEMPLE SERVICE 135 case of the costly sattra sacrifice. The sattra was a big soma sacrifice lasting from 12 to 61 or even 100 days and required a number of priests for successful completion. It was beyond the financial possibilities of the ordinary Brahman unless a royal patron or rich citizen paid for it. But for the richer temples the initial cost of such a sacrifice presented no insurmountable obstacle. Therefore the jealous traditionalists laid down a rule that devasvam was not to be used for a sattra sacrifice.24 Several such prescriptions which seem specially designed to keep the temple priests in check are found in the Smrtis and Purāņas. But they failed to curb the new type of worship. The devalabas proved to be good managers. They were successful in increasing the fame and power of many temples to such an extent that they gained far more than regional importance. Tirthayãtrã , the pilgrimage to distant sacred places, became increasingly popular and the major temples became centres of interregional communication. But this outer success does not invalidate the arguments which were advanced by the orthodox Brahmans against the temple priests. From a religious point of view it is not the clever manage- ment of the god's fame which is important, but the personal and whole-hearted devotion towards him. Or, in the case of sacrifice, it is the offering itself which counts as a true gift to god, not the num- ber of people who may be attracted by it. Therefore, if we take the sacrifice in its true religious meaning, the devalaba did not sacrifice at all. He merely pretended to sacrifice by fraudulently offering to the god for a second time what had already been his property be- fore. Thus there was no religious merit whatever in the sacrifice as such. The only merit lay in the field of propaganda, in the spread of the god's fame and glory and in the opportunity given to the devo- tees who had come from afar on the occasion of the festival in order to approach the deity and to win his grace. At this point it becomes obvious that jealousy and the struggle for social privileges were not the only factors in the conflict. There had evolved two contrasting conceptions about the essential qualities and duties of a priest. According to one conception the priest himself should be a man of great spiritual faculties, a rsi, yogin or a knower of brahman , and certainly a bright example for all those who wished to gain salvation. According to the other con- 24 BhP. I, 139,20.</page><page sequence="11">136 HEINRICH VON STIETENCRON ception the priest need not of necessity be a saint. Of course he too is trying to work his own perfection, but his essential task, next to serving his deity, is to lead as many devotees as possible into the presence of god. The two conceptions, one might think, do not necessarily exclude each other. But the fact is that the detachment and spiritual maturity which is needed to suit the first conception would be a serious drawback for the second where an able manager is really what is called for. On the other hand management of religion, while possibly quite irreligious in itself, may produce spiritual results in the hearts of countless and unnamed devotees. The develabas, to whose activities the rapid growth of Hindu sects was probably due about 2000 years ago, were acting according to the second conception of the priest's task. They propagated their religion successfully. Yet when organizing big festivals in order to attract the devotees and pilgrims and to replenish the temple's treasures they acted to some extent in the materialistic spirit of Kautalya. Kautalya , while making various proposals as to how funds for the royal treasury could be raised, says that the devatā- dhyaJcsa, the Superintendent of temples, should raise money from the credulous people by organizing religious fairs or festive gather- ings and by staging miracles etc.25 Kautalya suggested it for the benefit of the king. The devalabas did part of it for the benefit of their god. And the orthodox Brah- mans resented it mainly out of jealousy, but also with a feeling that an essential issue of religion was at stake.

In contrast to the orthodox Vedic views, the new image worship and temple service implied an entirely different concept of god. It also encouraged a different notion of the essential functions of the priest. Vedic gods had been limited in their functions but they ruled universally over these functions without geographical limitations. The localization of gods in images reduced this geographical uni- versality. Regional or even local gods developed. But together with their localization in space went a marked universalization of their functions, especially in the case of a few major Hindu gods : One god was considered as supreme Lord, encompassing within himself all aspects and functions of the other gods, and he could be directly approached for all needs and aims of life, of which salvation or final release gradually attained special importance. The earlier emphasis on the gods' actions and functions within an overwhelming world experienced by man, shifted towards an emphasis on man's thoughts, emotions and actions in relation to a transcendental reality which could be experienced as a personal god. The image made his presence both visible and permanent. Certainly, the geo- graphical limitation brought about by the localization of the god 2 The Vedic terms éiénádeva and muradeva are not very clear. A šišnádeva has been taken as somebody whose god is a phallus. In the word muradeva the Indian tradition relates the first part mūra to mūļa (Kāsikā on Pāņini 8, 2, 18) or mudila (Sãyana). Wackernagel accepting mula : "root" compares it with German "Maul" (The root as mouth of the tree compare skr. pãdapai "drinking with its feet", "tree". Kleine Schriften I, 1953, p. 329f.) Lüders, while classifying muradeva as a Bahuvrīhi like éraddâdeva and ánrtadeva mentions Geldner's note to RV. 10, 87, 2 and renders it as "dessen Götter die Wurzeln sind" (Lüders, Philologica Indica, 1940, p. 364, note 1). All this does not help in making the term muradeva any clearer. Geldner himself translates "Götzenanbeter" (RV. 7, 104, 24; 10, 87, 2; 10, 87, 14). I propose to derive the word from a root mf/mür : "to coagulate", "stiffen" (variant of mūrch, mürchati without sk-Infix. On mürchati see Lüders, op. cit. p. 180) and connected to mūrti : "stiff body", "form". The word mura (mř &gt; mura , like pf &gt; pura , tf &gt; tira etc.) might mean: "rigid", "stiff", "immovable". Muradeva could then designate somebody "whose god is immovable" (Bahuvrīhi with accent on first member) or an "immovable god" (Tatpuruça with rare accent on first member, as the occurrence of the form müradevin in the Paippalāda Samhitā suggests). In both cases the word would refer to images which were possibly worshipped by the non-Vedic community.</page><page sequence="13">138 HEINRICH VON STIETENCRON in an image could be reduced by multiplying images and temples"of the same god.
