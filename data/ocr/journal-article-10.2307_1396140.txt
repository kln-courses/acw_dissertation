Just fifteen years ago, in the wake of the Six Day War, the future of Jewish-Christian dialogue appeared to be singularly unpromising. Many Jews who had responded enthusiastically to the formulations of Vati- can II began to have second thoughts. It was claimed that most Christian religious leaders had remained silent during the harrowing period of May and early June, 1967, when the future of Israel hung in the balance. What good was dialogue if it failed to elicit a response of solidarity on the most critical issue of Jewish concern? Based on the number of relevant books published within the past two or three years, one might conclude today that few topics are of greater importance in contemporary religious thought. For many Christians, the issue of whether their sacred texts and classical theology have an inherent anti-Jewish bias has become explosive. The mode of reconciling the uni- versalistic claims of Christianity with respect for the integrity of Judaism as a living tradition is frequently used as a touchstone for evaluating various theological systems. For Jews, the problems are somewhat different. As has often been noted, Christian theology requires some understanding of Judaism, while the converse is not true.

Are they written in response to a perceived pressure, in the tradition of "know what to respond," or in a genuine attempt to clarify and communicate? Is Christi- anity presented fairly, in a manner that knowledgeable Christians would recognize as valid; is Judaism described in accordance with the consensus of the best modern scholarship; or does the representation of the re- spective faiths retain the distortions and the stereotyped generalizations so familiar from older apologetic tracts? The four books under review exemplify different approaches to Jewish-Christian dialogue; they are satisfying and successful in varying degrees. Issues in the Jewish-Christian Dialogue: Jewish Perspectives on Cove- nant, Mission and Witness, is a collection of commissioned essays, and the problems of the book are not unusual for this format: considerable un- evenness in level and inconsistent appropriateness to the general topic. The first essay is called "The Covenant in Jewish Tradition: Historical Considerations," by Leonard Kravitz (whose name is misspelled in the Table of Contents). It begins, "To speak of the covenant under historical considerations, is to raise questions some of which are not easily answered. What do we mean by 'considerations'? What do we mean by 'historical'? What do we mean by 'covenant'?" I wonder how many readers would feel encouraged to continue after such an opening. Most of the "historical considerations" turn out to be a simplistic narrative of Jewish history from Abraham through the rabbinic period. Starting with the Middle Ages, the historical narrative ends, and we are given instead a procession of thinkers-Halevi and Crescas, Geiger, Rosenzweig, Buber and Baeck-who apparently constitute the "Jewish Tradition." Two of the essays on "Witness and Mission" are similarly disap- pointing. Ben Zion Bokser, writing on "Witness and Mission in Judaism," simply tries to cover too much. His treatment is most inadequate for the "Post-Rabbinic Period." The centuries from the end of the Talmud to Rav Kook are represented by three quotations-from Saadia Gaon, Mai- monides, and Nahman of Bratslav-each expressing a universalistic outlook on the Gentiles. Bokser concedes that "various levels of parochi- alism in Judaism have blunted the universal vision as it is conventionally understood. Centuries of persecution have made some Jews defensive, developing in them distrust, even hostility toward the non-Jewish world." But such attitudes are clearly aberrations in the author's view; the norm is Jewish open-minded toleration in contrast with Christian exclusivist particularism. This essay is a good example of an exercise in apologetics through selective quotation, where what is needed is a balanced treatment of the diverse perspectives in the tradition. Leon Stitskin's piece on "Witnessing and Personal Religious Experi- ence" is an exposition and defense of his own "philosophy of Jewish personalism." While not without interest on its own terms, its value 312</page><page sequence="3">Jewish-Christian Dialogue within the context of this book is not readily discernible. The four remaining essays are decidedly more successful. Elliot Dorff discusses the problematics of the concept of covenant in modern Jewish thought. After analyzing the "objectivist" and "existentialist" approaches, as seen in the work of Mordecai Kaplan and Hermann Cohen, Dorff suggests a set of criteria to judge the adequacy of any doctrine of covenant for contemporary Jewish life. An acceptable doctrine must yield a covenant that is a unique and dynamic relationship between a God so conceived as to be capable of entering it and the people of Israel, imposing both ritual and moral obli- gations on the individual Jew and the Jewish community, containing religious, historical and ethnic dimensions (ties to land and language). Affirmation of this covenant involves effort, pain and sacrifice, but the predominant Jewish response is one of joy. Its purpose is to better the world, culminating in the goal of the messianic era. Dorff then measures the various theological stances in modern Jewish thought against this standard. Much of this formulation reflects what is probably a broad consensus in contemporary Judaism. The most controversial assertion is the fol- lowing: "Any version of the covenant which denies either its obligatory character or the identification of its obligations with classical Jewish law is not a plausible extension of the traditional covenant idea. . . . Any modern interpretation of the covenant must in some way require commit- ment to observing Jewish law, however it is delineated, and must not leave it to the individual to determine the content of the covenant's obligations and which of them he will voluntarily obey. ... In this, Mendelssohn, Cohen, and Rosenzweig are right, while Spinoza, Kaplan, and Buber are wrong." This position would invalidate the claims of a substantial segment of the American Jewish community to participate legitimately in the cove- nant. It would therefore be illuminating for Dorff to add one further category not included among his criteria: the sanctions or consequences of failing to observe one's obligations under the covenant as he con- ceives them. Perhaps the most important essay for the purpose stated in the title is Manfred Vogel's "Covenant and the Interreligious Encounter." Vogel begins by outlining the different possible Christian formulations of the relationship between the "old" and "new" covenant. There are discon- tinuous models, in which the new covenant abrogates the old either by terminating the covenantal status of the Jewish people or by nullifying the substance of the old covenant-the mitzvot-as a means to salvation. And there are continuous models, in which the new covenant is seen not as a repudiation but as a kind of fulfilment of the old. In this second approach, the New Dispensation may be seen as ex- tending the covenant to a new clientele, the Gentiles. Or it may be 313</page><page sequence="4">Marc Saperstein viewed as changing the structure of faith from one inextricably bound up with ethnicity to one based on the ontological transformation of the indi- vidual. This yields a rather unexpected analysis of the relationship between the two kinds of faith. Christian faith, according to Vogel, occurs in the direct, unmediated relationship between the individual and God; Jewish faith requires that the vertical relationship with God be mediated through the horizontal relationship with other human beings. This argu- ment may be something of a shock to those Jews brought up on the cliche that it is Christianity which requires a mediator between the individual and God. One of the functions of this literature should be precisely to challenge tired patterns of thought among one's own co-religionists. Vogel asserts that from the Jewish standpoint, either formulation of the "continuous model" is "acceptable." He does not suggest how Jews are to relate to those Christians who may still affirm one of the discontinu- ous models, or whether dialogue between Jews and such Christians is possible on any level. It is therefore unclear whether he considers aban- doning that model to be a precondition for meaningful interreligious communication. But the essay on the whole is a judicious analysis of a critical issue in Christian thought from a Jewish perspective. The final two essays in the book deal with the Holocaust and its implications for the concepts of Jewish witness and mission. Daniel Polish makes an important point about the need for time, distance and per- spective to assimilate the meaning of the Holocaust into Jewish experi- ence, noting that if the generation of the Exodus and wilderness had produced a Haggadah, it would have been far less uplifting than the one eventually created. He discerns two strands of Jewish witness in the literature that has already appeared: a recognition of the darker side of human nature, and an uncompromising commitment to the life of the Jewish people. Less convincing is his repudiation of the uniqueness of the Holocaust in Jewish experience, his insistence that it should be seen in the context of a history of Jewish suffering different in extent but not in intent. Martin Cohen makes a similar case: the Holocaust is not funda- mentally different from previous historical expressions of evil, and it must therefore pose no challenge to "the theological tradition of our faith, which speaks unequivocally of an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent God." It is only in connection with these categories that the "mission" of Israel makes sense. This translates into a mandate to address not only an internal Jewish agenda, but also the great moral challenges of the post-Auschwitz world: the destruction of the earth's ecosystem, the frustration of basic human needs, discrimination against the disad- vantaged, the dehumanization of individuals. The antithesis of these evils is identified with what Cohen calls the egalitarian-utopian "Wil- derness Ethic" of the Bible. Many Jews have apparently concluded that the lesson to be learned 314</page><page sequence="5">Jewish-Christian Dialogue from Auschwitz is the importance of self-defense framed by a narrow definition of Jewish interests and concerns. The argument that the fulfil- ment of an egalitarian-utopian ideal bears directly upon the welfare of Jews is therefore certainly worth making as a basis for Jewish social activism: "Every human being deprived of the fruits of the Wilderness Ethic becomes a potential anti-semite. Accordingly, Jews cannot rest secure until their mission of the universal implementation of the Wil- derness Ethic has been fully accomplished." I find it surprising, however, that Cohen, a historian, can write, "Jews have traditionally and perennially, wherever possible, been in the forefront of movements designed to further the ideals of the Wilderness Ethic." Unless "wherever possible" covers all counter examples, this is simply a falsification of the record. Like it or not, throughout the Middle Ages Jews traditionally allied themselves with the absolute rule of kings and viewed with horror virtually all movements considered by modern historians as "populist" or "progressive." They felt their well-being was dependent upon strong, even authoritarian central rule, not egalitarian social justice. For every quotation mustered to buttress the claim that Jewish historical experience produced "a respect for the equivalence and dignity of all humanity," a dozen exist that reveal a very different evaluation of the Gentile world. Cohen's agenda may indeed be a good one, but let us not pretend that it emerges unambiguously from the tradition. Such a claim can be substantiated only by rhetorical leger-de-main; it may work in a sermon for Brotherhood Week, but it is inadequate as a firm basis for interreligious dialogue. Jews who expect Christians to confront honestly the anti-Judaic elements in the Christian tradition have an obligation to be no less honest about the exclusivist elements in their own. II The first thing to be said about Clemens Thoma's A Christian Theology of Judaism is that the title is somewhat misleading. The book does many things, but as far as I can tell, does not give what the title promises. The touchstone of any Christian theology of Judaism, as David Flusser points out in a provocative and informative Foreword, is how a Christian thinker will treat the continued existence of the Jewish people and the Jewish religion from New Testament times to the present. Does this survival play a positive role in God's plan; is Judaism a sufficient framework for the fulfilment of God's will without the Christ; what is the relationship between the covenant with Israel and the New Dispensation? While Thoma states at the outset that "Judaism is self-reliant and autonomous," the book does not address in depth these critical questions. A more accurate title, then, might have been "A Christian Theology and Judaism", or "A Christian Theology in Light of Judaism." What 315</page><page sequence="6">Marc Saperstein Thoma does is to draw upon his scholarly understanding of Judaism, es- pecially of the Second Commonwealth and early rabbinic periods, to il- luminate the origins of Christianity, to assess the figure of Jesus, his teachings, and the doctrines about him in their historical context, and thereby to draw certain implications for Christian-Jewish relations. After some introductory thoughts-on "The Theological Dimension of Jewish-Christian Relations", the author outlines his picture of "Early Judaism" (along with others, Thoma repudiates the term "Late Judaism," frequently used by German scholars, because of its implication that Judaism was nearing the end of its useful life). He emphasizes the diversity of Jewish groups and the wide spectrum of positions on critical issues such as the proper relationship to Hellenism and the nature of the commitment to the religio-political good of the Jewish people. His conclusion is that "All the religious ideas and ideals of the New Testament were circulating in some form among the contemporary Jews who did not believe in Christ;" the only new content was provided by the person of Jesus and the theological interpretations inspired by his death. Later, he follows Moltmann in arguing that the Trinitarian view is not incompatible with the Jewish understanding of God. Even the doctrine of Incarnation, he maintains, is not in "unambiguous contrast" with the spirit of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). This latter argument, supported only by a few anthropomorphic verses from the Bible, strikes me as so weak it would more profitably have been omitted. Let the reader be the judge. Thoma then presents his views on the standard problems of New Testament interpretation bearing on Jewish-Christian relations. He ar- gues that Jesus was not a member of any Jewish religious party, but an independent figure who nurtured links with all groups. Jesus' disputes with the Pharisees should not be understood as implying a rejection of the basic assumptions of Pharisaic Judaism. He was not a transgressor of the law. He was put to death for political reasons, not religious ones. The Passion, as product of a tyrannical political system that fostered slander and devious machinations, should unite rather than separate Christians and Jews. There are times when even a well-meaning and knowledgeable Christian writer may touch raw nerves. Consider the following passage: "Had the Jewish public taken more seriously Jesus' preaching against apocalyptic dreams of the future, against Zealot and Pharisee fanaticism toward sin and ritual impurity, against human intolerance and group hostilities, against the amassing of riches, and against religious chau- vinism, the fateful Jewish revolt against Rome (66-73 CE) the destruction of the Temple, and the decimation and deportations of the people might not have occurred." Of course, like all statements of the form "if x had occurred, y would not have occurred," the proposition is by its very 316</page><page sequence="7">Jewish-Christian Dialogue nature not susceptible to empirical confirmation. There is simply no way of either proving or disproving how history would have been different under certain hypothetical circumstances. One would also want to evaluate the underlying assumptions of the statement: that the preaching of Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, is evidence for the existence of unusually widespread fanaticism, in- tolerance, chauvinism and greed among first-century Jews, that these qualities were responsible for the destruction of the Temple, and that they could have been eliminated if people had merely taken a certain preacher more seriously. I doubt that there are many modern historians who would want to defend all of these assumptions. Presumably, Thoma would not endorse the classical Christian teach- ing that the Temple was destroyed because the Jews refused to accept the Christ. But his own suggestion that perhaps the Temple was destroyed because the Jews did not respond to the preaching of Jesus might strike some readers as a modified reformulation of that rather distasteful doctrine. Later, the book turns to a discussion of the theological significance of the Holocaust. After criticizing those theologians who "refashion the grief of the Jews, innocently herded into the gas ovens, into rhetoric against Church and Judaism" (sic: should it be "Christianity"?), Thoma continues, "On the other hand, a believing Christian should not find it so very difficult to interpret the sacrifice [Opfergang] of the Jews during the Nazi terror. His thoughts should be turned toward Christ to whom these Jewish masses became alike [sic], in sorrow and death. Auschwitz is the most monumental sign of our time for the intimate bond and unity between the Jewish martyrs-who stand for all Jews-and the crucified Christ, even though the Jews in question would not be aware of it." These sentences, undoubtedly well-intentioned, raise some troubling questions. Despite the appropriation of the word "Holocaust" from the vocabulary of the sacrificial cult, many would argue that this is an improper choice of terminology. A "sacrifice" is made for a purpose; it subsumes pain under a higher goal; it is supposed to be carried out in accordance with God's will. To refer to the six million as a "sacrifice" is to whitewash the evil of the Nazis, to ignore the absolute and unredeeming irrationality and purposelessness of the "Final Solution". If Thoma were simply to say to his Christian readers, "Think of your associations with the passion of Jesus the Jew, his agony on the cross, his confusion and apparent despair: this is what six million Jews experienced a generation ago," he would help in the creation of constructive empathy. Instead he uses the "crucified Christ" as a way of interpreting the fate of the six million. The "crucified Christ" bears clear theological associa- tions-especially with the doctrines of dedemptive suffering and vicarious atonement-which do not seem appropriate to the agonies of Auschwitz. 317</page><page sequence="8">Marc Saperstein III Pinhas Lapide, who describes himself as an orthodox Jew, has become a rather controversial figure in the Jewish community because of his widely publicized views concerning the origins of Christianity. His earlier formulations were agnostic: he conceded the possibility that the resur- rection of Jesus may have been a historical event, arguing that to deny this possibility is a blasphemous limitation of God's power. In Jewish Monotheism and Christian Trinitarian Doctrine, he takes an unambiguous position: "I accept the resurrection of Easter Sunday not as an invention of the community of disciples, but as a historical event." This alone, he maintains, can explain the transformation of a group of crushed and despairing followers into a rejoicing community of salvation. It was a miracle performed by God to make possible the founding of a Church which would point the way to salvation for much of the Gentile world. Unfortunately, Lapide's opening discussion of "Jewish Monotheism" is a rather dismal performance. The convoluted argument makes three points. First, Jewish authorities have generally taken a mild position toward the theological status of Christian Trinitarian doctrine, con- sidering it a genuine if not entirely pure form of monotheism. Second, there are "many triadic (in no way Trinitarian) traces... to be found in Judaism." And third, the doctrine of Jesus, Paul and the first century primitive Church was indeed pure monotheism, while the Trinitarian doctrine was a later (third and fourth century) development. The first point is a misrepresentation of the tradition. Whether Christianity was to be considered idolatry or not was debated- Maimoni- des, among others, believed that it was-but few authorities who took the more lenient view would have said that the classical Christian doctrine is a genuine monotheism. Many rabbis considered this doctrine to be in an intermediate category: not idolatry, because Christians worshipped the true God, not monotheism, because they worshipped something in addi- tion to the true God. This characterization of Christian belief as shittuf was a convenient way of excluding medieval Christians from the re- strictive Talmudic laws governing relations with idolaters. But the fact that the same belief when held by a Jew would be considered idolatry clearly distinguished it from genuine monotheism. Lapide merely con- fuses the issue. As for the second point, the five pages where he attempts to sub- stantiate his thesis (pp. 34-38) contain some of the most contorted reason- ing, impressionistically irresponsible use of source material, and sloppy documentation that I have ever seen in print. To take just one example, what possible relevance can there be in stating that "Johannes Reuchlin, the student of two rabbis" interpreted the second word of the Hebrew Bible, bara, as an acronym for ben, ruah, elohim (son, spirit, God)? The 318</page><page sequence="9">Jewish-Christian Dialogue implication is that Reuchlin received this tradition from his rabbinical mentors. In fact, this interpretation of bara was standard among medieval Christians who tried to find Trinitarian allusions in the Hebrew Bible. It must be the first time a Jew has ever cited the interpretation to document "triadic . . . traces in Judaism." Lapide shows a remarkable lack of concern for chronology, for accuracy of quotation, or for proper methodology in the use of sources. He has an annoying habit of footnoting even familiar Biblical quotations, but failing to document the most important and problematic references (e.g. "The Spirit, the Glory, and the Lord's Self [in Ezek. 3:12], say several of the mystics-there you have it: the three manifestations of the Godhead"-with no indication of who the several mystics might be or what precisely they did say). This is not how Judaism should be repre- sented for dialogue or any other purpose. Jurgen Moltmann's essay, by contrast, is rather elegant in its straight- forward simplicity. Drawing heavily from A. J. Heschel's The Prophets, and to a lesser extent from studies of rabbinic theology by A. M. Goldberg and Peter Kuhn and of Jewish mysticism by Gershom Scholem, Moltmann distinguishes between the authentic Jewish monotheism of the Bible, the rabbis and the mystics, and the philosophical monotheism classically formulated by Aristotle. The latter entails a conception of God as absolute and indivisible unity, which cannot change, or even feel emotion in response to any external stimulus. The former is a God who communi- cates, freely commits Himself in covenant, passionately participates in His creation, and, most important, suffers with the sufferings of His people. Christians and Jews share the historical experience of the "passion and suffering of their God," as against the apathetic God of the philoso- phers; those Jewish philosophers who eventually adopted the Aristo- telian notion of monotheism "threw the baby out with the bath water." The Christian doctrine of the Trinity, an attempt to articulate this funda- mental religious reality, is therefore not a contradiction to "Jewish" (as opposed to "philosophical") monotheism. There is little in Moltmann's argument that Lapide finds objectionable, and many Jewish readers would probably agree. Moltmann has suggested an important common ground for the two theological traditions; the notion of "dynamic mono- theism" as articulated by Moltmann is characterized by Lapide as the "direction of a bridge between us." Actually, Lapide appears far more impressive in the "Dialogue" section of the book, where he responds to questions from the audience (including the painfully predictable, "What prevents you then from having yourself baptized and becoming a Christian?"). Particularly ef- fective is his argument for the positive meaning of the Jewish rejection of Jesus as Christ: alongside the "small Jewish yes" of the primitive com- 319</page><page sequence="10">Marc Saperstein munity and Paul, there had to be a "large Jewish no," a repudiation by the overwhelming majority of the Jewish people. Otherwise, if all Jews had accepted the resurrected Jesus as Christ, "the entire church would have remained intra-Jewish-and to be honest, we did not need it. Since Sinai we have known the way to the Father. You Gentiles on the other hand were very much in need of it." Moltmann later makes a very similar point; it is a second major issue on which the two thinkers find themselves in agreement. Despite the opening essay, then, there is much in this little book that deserves careful reading. Lapide challenges Jews to think about some basic questions. Is the success of Christianity over the ages a positive part of God's plan? On what grounds can a Jew who accepts the miracles in the Hebrew Scripture deny the possibility that the resurrection of Jesus was historical fact? What should be the proper place of Jesus in the Jewish tradition? How should Jews react if the long-awaited Messiah turns out to be the Nazarene? ("I cannot imagine that even a single Jew who believes in God would have the least thing against that.") While not many would share all of his conclusions, many might agree that a Jewish probing of such issues would produce fruitful results. IV Several years ago, Eugene Borowitz, who teaches Jewish religious thought at Hebrew Union College (New York), was invited to present a major paper to the American Theological Society, giving his evaluation of developments in recent Christian theological writing. His book, Con- temporary Christologies: A Jewish Response, grew out of the reading and thinking for that presentation. It is a book that breaks new ground; so far as I know, no other Jew has done quite the same thing, and there is no Christian counterpart. It is not within my competence to judge the appropriateness of Borowitz's selection of Christian theologians, the aptness of his classifica- tion, or the accuracy of his presentation of their views. As far as the "Jewish response" is concerned, however, the book fulfils at least four functions extremely well. The first continues one of the functions of traditional apologetical literature, on a somewhat higher level. Borowitz articulates for the Jewish community why it is not convinced by Christian doctrine, thereby pro- viding intellectual foundations for what is often an inarticulate emotional response. While much of the older literature was directed toward dis- torted oversimplifications of Christian doctrines, this book responds to the most sophisticated expositions of the past generation. Secondly, the book serves to explain to Christian thinkers what resonance their teachings have in its author, a believing liberal Jew. 320</page><page sequence="11">Jewish-Christian Dialogue who is trained to appreciate the nuances and subtleties of theological argumentation, yet who is also close enough to the pulse of the American Jewish community to express with power and eloquence its concerns. Of particular interest to many may be his chapter on "Christology and Anti- Semitism", in which he examines the thesis of Rosemary Ruether that Christology is inherently anti-Jewish. His conclusion is that this is not valid for the contemporary theologians he has read: "while some rem- nants of [anti-Semitism] are to be found among traditionalist theologians, other traditionalists as well as liberals and post-liberals have found anti- Semitism antithetical to their understanding of the Christ." In this context, it is instructive to compare the recently published conclusion of J.T. Pawlikowski, based on a somewhat different sample, that "Christology continues to suffer from a deep anti-Judaic Malady."' Thirdly, Borowitz informs his Jewish readers what they might learn from Christian thinkers whose works are not exactly best-sellers in the Jewish community. He suggests certain underlying issues on which dia- logue with specific Christian theologians would be fruitful: the proble- matics of historical evidence for religious occurrences, the challenge of explaining a traditional, exclusivistic position in terms of modern thought, the difficulty of identifying what is "authentic" in a religious tradition against the background of historical change and contemporary pluralism, the problem of liberty and its proper constraints, the impact of ethical humanism upon the ethical sense of Christians and Jews. In a particularly suggestive section, Borowitz shows how it may be possible for Christian theological writing to help conceptualize funda- mental issues in the Jewish tradition by attempting to classify Jewish systems of thought in accordance with their treatment of the relationship between "Torah" and "Culture," along the lines of H. Richard Niebuhr's classic Christ and Culture. He finds that Niebuhr's work challenges the contemporary Jewish community in another, yet more important way: to formulate a new foundation for social concern and action that transcends narrowly construed Jewish self-interest. Finally, the book serves to exemplify some rules for inter-religious dialogue. The most important is, as Borowitz puts it, "One cannot discuss other people's religion until one has come to understand it in a way that they would find recognizable. 'What is hateful to you, do not do unto your neighbor."' He sharply criticizes Jewish writers of the past 150 years whose work reveals a "simplistic, perhaps even ignorant" view of Christian ethics. His critique of Leo Baeck's famous essay, "Romantic Religion," which however understandable as a reaction to the Christian stereotype of Jewish "legalism" presents a stereotype no less objectionable, is devastating and long overdue. There is also an important point about liberalism and traditionalism within the respective traditions. Borowitz argues that dialogue should occur between representatives of different religions who share common 321</page><page sequence="12">Marc Saperstein epistemological assumptions: liberal Jews and liberal Christians, tradi- tionalists of both faiths. Otherwise the inter-religious discussion can become hopelessly mired. "To dispute Barth's Christology because of its unscientific sense of reality is not to challenge Barth's Christianity, but his traditionalist way of speaking about religion." With all the concern for methodology evidenced in the book, one is left somewhat confused by a failure to define more precisely the basis of the author's stance in reacting to the Christian teachings discussed. Borowitz explains at the very beginning his own personal theological position as a "Reform Jew of religiously traditional bent," but it is not always clear whether he claims to speak only for himself, or for other liberal Jews, or for Jews as a whole. Quite often, he reacts as an individual: "I do not think," "I also have problems with," "I sense . . . I surmise . . . My intuition in this regard," "an almost complete lack of comprehension overtakes me, surely for reasons of my specific Jewish outlook." But he also uses more encompas- sing terms: "Jews see the issue," "Jews believe," "Jews would then want to inquire," "Jews obviously do not share," "Jews cannot understand." And occasionally, the tradition as a whole is personified: "Judaism felt," "Judaism would be most at home," "Major differences with Judaism surface ... congenial to Judaism.... Judaism believes ... the emphasis on deed Judaism makes primary." What precisely is meant in asserting that "Judaism believes" x and not y? How is this to be determined in a tradition of such extraordinary theological diversity? Borowitz is obviously aware of this problem, and he criticizes Christian writers for a lack of precision on just this score. An outline of the methodological problems in confronting the Jewish tra- dition would have made this book even more valuable. This leads to a more general point. My impression is that most of the Jewish writers represented in these books still conceive of the Jewish tradition in ways that reflect the assumptions of 19th-century Wissenschaft and German philosophical idealism. The "tradition" they speak of is rabbinic theology a la George Foot Moore, medieval philosophy, and Mendelssohn, Cohen, Baeck, Buber, Rosenzwieg and Kaplan in modern times. The work of Gershom Scholem and two generations of his dis- ciples, discoveries that have broken the mold of this "classic" tradition so frequently invoked, seem to have made little impact. Pinhas Lapide contrasts the Kabbalists with "normal Jews like myself." Martin Cohen cites "the theological tradition of our faith, which speaks unequivocally of an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent God" (ac- tually the closest the Jewish world has ever come to a universally accepted theology was probably Lurianic Kabbalah in the mid-seventeenth century, a system for which the concept of divine omnipotence is totally inap- propriate). There is only one passing reference to "Jewish mystics" in Borowitz's book. 322</page><page sequence="13">Jewish-Christian Dialogue 323 Christian writers have for their own purposes seized upon the newly documented evidence of Jewish theological diversity in ancient and medieval times. On the Jewish side, much of the work of assimilating the fruits of modern scholarship into a self-understanding of the Jewish tradition adequate for the most rigorous demands of inter-religious en- counter remains to be done.
