<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS Obituaries With deep regret we record the deaths of these important scholars in the archaeological field: Jan Hendrik Jongkees, profes- sor of Classical archaeology at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands, who wrote extensively on archae- ological and numismatic subjects, died March 4, 1967, at the age of 53; Moshe Stekelis, professor of prehistory at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, outstanding prehistorian with many important discoveries to his credit, died March 12, 1967, at the age of 69; Chrestos Karouzos, director of the National Museum at Athens for twenty-three years and well known for his writings on many facets of Greek archaeology, died March 30, 1967, at the age of 67. Historical Archaeology We owe the following informa- tion to Edward McM. Larrabee, formerly in charge of archaeological research at the Fortress of Louis- bourg, who has been intimately connected with the founding of this new society: The excavation of historic sites in the New World has become a rapidly expanding field of activity. Workers in this field have increas- ingly felt the need for communica- tion, so that their study can have a solid basis. A number of symposia have been held in connection with the meetings of other societies since 1961. For the last six years an an- nual meeting has been held in the southeastern United States, con- ducted by Stanley South of the North Carolina Department of Archives and History. During the spring of 1966 special conferences on the subject were organized at the meeting of the Central States Anthropological Society by Malcolm Watkins of the Department of Cultural History of the Smithsonian Institution and by Arnold Pilling. Out of these sessions grew the resolution to hold a con- ference specifically to consider the status of the entire field, and whether it was desirable to found a new society. The conference, sponsored by Southern Methodist University, was held in Dallas, Texas, January 6-7, 1967, and was attended by over one hundred delegates from all parts of the United States as well as Canada and Mexico. The proposals of a special committee were submitted to the conference, and as a result The Society for Historical Archae- ology was formed. The main interest of the society is in problems within the period since the beginning of European ex- ploration, and related to the effect of European expansion. Thus the starting date varies from the mid- fifteenth century in some parts of the world to the late nineteenth in others. The geographical areas of prime concern are within the West- ern Hemisphere, but can include Oceanian, African and Asian ar- chaeology, as well as that of sites in Europe which have direct bear- ing upon problems outside Europe. In the latter case there will be close cooperation with such counterpart societies as The Post-Medieval Re- search Group in Great Britain. Thus the new society will consider both strictly European occupation (out- side Europe) and aboriginal sites or material showing some form of re- sponse to European culture. The unifying factor is that there is direct or indirect documentary evi- dence illuminating all the problems with which The Society for His- torical Archaeology is concerned. The society encourages interested persons to join. It is intended to in- clude responsible amateurs as well as professional archaeologists, his- torians, museum curators, archi- vists, architects and administrators. Membership is $7.50 per year for individuals and $15.00 for insti- tutions. A publication, Historical Archaeology, is to be issued at least once a year. It will contain major scholarly articles and shorter notes. The contents of the first issue will include the papers given at the Dallas conference. The society will meet during the first half of each year. The next meeting will take place January 11- 14, 1968, at Colonial Williamsburg, and the program will include work- ing sessions for the study of specific material. The officers elected at Dallas were: President, John L. Cotter, National Park Service, Phila- delphia; President-Elect, Edward B. Jelks, Southern Methodist Univer- sity, Dallas; Secretary-Treasurer, Arnold R. Pilling, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202. Applications for membership may be addressed to Dr. Pilling. Beazley Gifts at Ashiflolean The reputation of Sir John Beaz- ley as the greatest living scholar in the field of Greek vase painting is world-wide, but the rôle of Sir John and Lady Beazley as collectors of ancient art is comparatively little known. This rôle now becomes manifest with the opening, on April 24th, of a "Select Exhibition of Sir John and Lady Beazley's Gifts to the Ashmolean Museum, 1912- 1966," and with the publication of a catalogue of 666 objects chosen from more than a thousand given to the Museum during forty- four years. With a foreword by R. W. Hamilton and a biographical sketch of Sir John Beazley by Bernard Ashmole, the catalogue incorporates unpublished notes by Sir John on many of the objects and ends with a complete bibliography of his pub- lished writings through 1966. 217</page><page sequence="2">Nearly five hundred of the objects are illustrated in the catalogue, some with two or three views. As might be expected, the major part of the Beazley collection is comprised of Greek vases: Attic black-figured and red-figured, white- ground and black-glazed wares make up a little over half the total. Mycenaean, Protogeometric, Geometric and Orientalizing vessels are all represented, as are many Hellenistic wares of both Greece and Italy and Roman pottery of both Italy and the provinces. Lamps, terracottas, small bronzes, gems and stone sculpture are all present in series. From outside the Classical world there is a small number of Egyptian antiquities, largely of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, and two Luristan bronzes. Only about three hundred of the objects have ever been published in any form; a large proportion of these are the black-figured and red-fig- ured vases and fragments. The catalogue thus presents a large body of material for the first time and offers more complete descrip- tion and illustration for much that has been published before. The exhibition cannot but add greatly to the prestige of the Ashmolean Mu- seum, just as it adds a new dimen- sion to the universal appreciation of Sir John and Lady Beazley. The exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, England, is open April 24-June 2 and June 27 to September 9, 1967. The catalogue is published by the Oxford Uni- versity Press (30 s.). Abu Simbel Rises The two famous temples of Abu Simbel, which were destined to be inundated after the completion of the High Dam at Aswan, have now been moved two hundred feet up the cliff. The so-called Great Tem- ple, built by Ramses II, is being re- erected in its new location and is nearly completed. The smaller tem- ple, built by the same pharaoh, was still in blocks as of last December, but is expected to be re-erected soon. The story of the fight to save the two temples and various other mon- uments in the upper Nile Valley is well known. Various plans were suggested for preserving the tem- ples of Abu Simbel. In the end the decision was to saw the stone form- ing the buildings and their façades into blocks and to lift them to the top of the cliff, where they would be rebuilt, with artificial hills to be made behind them reproducing their original setting. It was an engineering feat of no small magni- tude to carry out the plan, especially considering the fact that both tem- ples were entirely excavated out of the solid rock. Now most of the difficult task begun in 1965 is finished and the temples will be completely re-erected in the spe- cially constructed setting by the spring of 1969, more than a year ahead of schedule. Our illustration ( furnished through the kindness of Frances F. Jones, who visited the site last December) shows the familiar colossal statues of Ramses, which had also been hewn out of the cliff, in place once again before the entrance to the temple. The upper part of the façade, with a frieze of baboons, is still to be re-erected. The steel arch showing behind the façade is structural, apparently a sort of relieving arch for the superstructure behind the upper façade. The verti- cal steel shaft at the side is a huge building crane set up on top of the cliff for hoisting the stone blocks up from their former location be- low. At present visitors to Abu Simbel cannot see the structures from the west bank of the river. Not only is the level of the water too low but worksheds also block the view. Visitors now disembark from the river boat a short distance down- stream and approach the site from the north. When the Nile rises to the full height of the dam down at Aswan, the old view from the river will be restored. Archaeological Prospecting A most attractive new journal, Prospezioni Archeologiche, has been inaugurated by the Fondazione C. M. Lerici. Beautifully printed, with excellent halftone plates, it is dedi- cated to the modern applications of science and technology to archae- ological prospecting. The first vol- ume (1966) contains the papers presented at the International Sym- posium on New Methods in Archae- ological Prospecting, held in Rome in 1965 to celebrate the first decade of the work of the Lerici Founda- tion. These are all in English, with summaries in Italian, but it is ex- pected that in the future papers will be published in their original language. The journal is to appear once or twice a year. The articles in the first issue are by the following authors: A. Hesse, C. Colani, R. E. Linington, I. Scol- lar, J. Alldred, M. J. Aitken and L. Langan. All deal with new tech- niques for locating objects or features under ground or under water. The subscription rate for three numbers will be 5000 lire in Italy or $10.00 elsewhere, for single num- bers 2000 lire or $4.00. The ad- dress of the Fondazione C. M. Lerici is via Veneto 108, Rome, Italy. 218</page><page sequence="3">Late Roman bathing establishment at Apollonia, from the south. Apollonia Excavations 1966 In the summer of 1966 the Uni- versity of Michigan with the assist- ance of the Corning Museum of Glass continued the excavation of salient areas of Apollonia, Libya, the harbor town of ancient Cyrene (see Archaeology 19 [1966] 56-57 ) . Once again the work was im- measurably assisted by the coopera- tion of the Libyan Antiquities Serv- ice, especially that of Mr. Richard Goodchild, Controller of Antiquities for Cyrenaica. Apollonia is located on the north coast of Africa south- west of Crete. The Piraeus is closer than the Nile: from the Egyptian delta the mariner had to travel about 800 kilometers, from the Saronic Gulf about 600. Distances from Crete and Thera are corre- spondingly less, and it was from Thera, Herodotus tells us, that the stammering Battus led his band of émigrés to North Africa at the end of the seventh century B.c. The Therans settled first on the island of Platea (in the Gulf of Bomba, sixty - five miles east of Cyrene) and sub- sequently at Aziris on mainland Africa, but ultimately they moved to Cyrene at the bidding of the native Libyans. At this time, pre- sumably, they also occupied Ap- ollonia, Cyrene's harbor town. One of our objectives in continu- ing the exploration and excavation of Apollonia was the provision of an accurate contoured plan of the site. We were lucky enough to find the Aero-Exploration company from Frankfurt, Germany, operating on behalf of the Libyan government, and commissioned them to make a contoured plan of the whole area from the air. This work, begun in 1965, has now been completed. Excavation in 1966 was concen- trated in three areas: the perimeter fortifications, an unknown structure within the city walls and the site of the extra-mural Doric temple. In 1965 work had focused on the more northerly of the two round towers of the fortifications and on the blocked city gate. Here several tests were sunk in 1966 against the socle courses of the tower and in front of the blocked gate. Potsherds retrieved from the lowest stratum suggest a date no earlier than the last quarter of the fourth century b.c. for the construction of the round tower, and are thus con- sistent with evidence provided by excavation elsewhere around the perimeter. The wall system - round towers, curtain walls and enfilading towers - was all constructed at the same time. At another point, midway be- tween the two round towers, an- other trench was set against the city wall to test the foundations. Here two chamber tombs were found cut into the vertical face of the bedrock on which the founda- tions for the city wall rest. When the perimeter fortification was built, these tombs were rifled and their stone doors smashed and thrown down before the entrances. Pottery and lamps found here indicate that the tombs were re-used over a period of about 150 years and that their main period was ca. 45Ö-300 B.c. Evidently, when the city walls were built in the Early Hellenistic phase, the city planners took no note of the Classical cemetery, and Apollonia's boundaries were ex- tended by a surrounding wall which did not hesitate to disturb the rest- ing places of earlier inhabitants. At the eastern end of the city, to- ward the acropolis, we began the clearance of one of the enfilading towers. Though the exterior line of the wall probably preserves the Hel- lenistic arrangement, there was ample evidence within of a complete By- zantine repair and rebuilding of the structure. Three arches were in- serted, of which the two southerly are preserved, and a cross wall di- vided the tower into two principal areas. The tower was entered through a doorway from the north, and a postern gate through the city wall immediately north of the tower provided an easy approach. Within the city walls, some two hundred meters east of the city gate, we excavated a structure of which blocks were visible before digging. This building (9.55 m. wide and 18.57 m. long) proved to be a bathing establishment which was never finished. Preserved are the foundations, the floor of the hypo- caust system in the three most easterly units, and one or two courses of the superstructure. En- trance to the building was intended to be from the west into a small apodyterium and thence into the frigidarium, tepidarium and cal- darium. At the east end of the build- ing were located the units intended probably to house the furnace and to provide hot plunge baths a c* m</page><page sequence="4">Doric capital from temple. cessible from the caldarium. Three flues connect the easternmost units with the intended caldarium, and three similar flues link the cal- darium with the tepidarium. A ledge around these hot rooms was pro- vided to help support (along with the brick piers below) the floors of the rooms, beneath which the cur- rents of hot air would flow. No trace of these floors was found but their intended level was indicated by the sills of the rooms and the protruding ledge. The masonry of massive squared blocks does not seem Byzantine by comparison with the masonry of the palace of the Byzantine duke close by. Yet the baths are unlikely to have been begun during the life- span of the Roman baths in Apol- lonia: These were in use until the great earthquake of A.D. 365 damaged them severely. They were never repaired, and 365 is a prob- able date for the beginning of work on our baths. Some of the blocks in this building (to judge by the meas- urements and the dressing) were taken from the city wall. This is likely to have taken place before A.D. 390, when the Asturiani, bar- barians from the hinterland south of the Syrtic Gulf, began to trouble Cyrenaica. Thereafter the robbing of masonry from the fortifications is scarcely likely. Our building, then, was probably begun in the third quarter of the fourth century; work stopped before the plumbers ever got in, and why the building was never completed is a riddle. The shell of the building re- mained untouched until it was de- cided to fill the yawning gaps with debris. Coins, pottery and glass were recovered in great quantities, and coins of Heraclius (610-641) from the lowest levels of this fill were the latest retrieved. It looks as if the fill had all been deposited at the same time, in the first quarter of the seventh century. After the fill had been shoveled in, scruffy squatters appeared on the scene. They laid irregular floors and closed the doorways connecting the units; circular stones set in the floors per- haps served to support poles for a rickety roof. Coins from this oc- cupation level are varied, but in- clude .examples from the reign of Phocas (602-610). These shabby squatters were the last inhabitants of Byzantine Apollonia. About one kilometer to the west of the city wall, between the Moslem cemetery and the sea, lies the leveled platform of an ancient temple. Cuttings in bedrock and ar- chitectural fragments were visible before clearing. The temple was oriented east-west and the ap- proach, now as in antiquity, is obliquely from the road which links Apollonia with Cyrene. After clearing, the area showed cuttings in bedrock to receive the lowest course of the crepidoma of the temple and several achitectural members, among which, as luck would have it, was an almost intact Doric capital. The setting lines and pry holes of the lowest course of the crepi- doma made it possible to calculate the disposition of the blocks of this course. At this level the structure measured 31.93 m. in length and 17.30 m. in width. The Doric capital is highly in- dividual; the sides of the abacus are not vertical but spread outward some 2 cm. in their oblique height of 19 cm. The profile of the echinus is quite straight and is so angled as to spread widely; the height of the echinus is less than that of the abacus. Masking the transition be- tween the base of the echinus and the column neck are the usual four annulets, and the columns had the customary twenty flutes. This cap- ital will be invaluable in reconstruc- ting the elevation; as for the plan, the best mathematical calculations, pending further research, suggest that the temple was hexastyle, with eleven columns on the flank. The date remains unclear. The 1966 season was in every respect most suçcessful. The date of the construction of Apollonia^ city wall was established, an unex- cavated building was cleared and identified as a Late Roman bathing establishment, and Apollonia's first pagan religious structure, the extra- mural Doric temple, was excavated and drawn. In our next and final season we shall again concentrate on the blocked city gate and on important areas within the city wall, and we also hope to complete the photographic and architectural documentation of Apollonia. John Griffiths Pedley Symposium in Beirut As part of its Centennial Year program the American University of Beirut was host to an Archae- ology Symposium March 7-10, 1967. This symposium brought to- gether scholars from the United States, Britain, France, Italy and The Lebanon to discuss the general topic: "The Role of the Phoenicians in the Interaction of Mediterranean Civilizations." Ten papers were pre- sented and several seminar sessions were devoted to various aspects of Phoenician civilization and the pres- entation of new discoveries in this field. The purpose of this symposium was twofold. First, it was felt that a survey of recent research and the discussion of some as yet unpub- lished archaeological finds would help to determine the present status of Phoenician studies. Second, it was considered necessary that a meeting of specialists in this field produce some indication as to the direction Phoenician studies should take in the future. The term "Phoe- nician" was interpreted in its widest sense, both geographically and chronologically, so that the sym- posium was able to cover a broad range of subjects. The following papers were pre- sented: "Relations entre l'Égypte et la Phénicie dans la période de l'empire," by Emir Maurice Chehab (Director-General of Antiquities, Lebanon); "Les relations entre l'Égypte et la Phénicie, du voyage d'Ounamon à l'expédition d'Alex- andre," by Jean Leclant (University of Paris); "The Phoenician Con- tribution to Biblical Wisdom Litera- ture," by Mitchell Dahood (Pontifi- cal Biblical Institute, Rome); "The Alphabet in the History of Civiliza- tion," by David Diringer (Cam- bridge University); "La défense du 220</page><page sequence="5">front méditerranéen de l'empire achéménide," by Maurice Dunand (director, excavations at Byblos); "Seleucus I and the Foundations of Hellenistic Syria," by Henri Seyrig (French Institute of Archaeology, Beirut); "Les Phéniciens de l'occi- dent d'après des découvertes arché- ologiques de Tripolitaine," by An- tonio DiVita (Department of Antiquities, Florence); "New Light on Punic Art," by Sabatino Moscati (University of Rome); "New Evi- dence on the Role of the Sea Peoples in Canaan at the Beginning of the Iron Age," by James B. Pritchard (University of Pennsylvania); and "A Century of Near Eastern Archaeology and the Future," by John A. Wilson (University of Chi- cago). These papers will be published as a Centennial Publication of the American University of Beirut. The Case of the Morgan Centaur The bronze statuette of a gallop- ing centaur wielding a pine branch was first published more than sixty years ago. It arrived in the Metro- politan Museum on loan from J. Pierpont Morgan between 1912 and 1914, and was given to the Museum by his son in 1917. Called Greek on the labels and in publications as late as 1953, it has quietly changed nationality, and in the new arrange- ment of the Greek and Roman collections it is exhibited with the Etruscan and Etrusco-Campanian material. This note will explain the change. The first publication occurred in Le Musée 3 (1906), the short-lived Revue d'art mensuelle that was edited by Georges Toudouze under the direction of Arthur Sambon. Here the centaur is illustrated on plate 1 that accompanies an article by Sambon, "Le Centaure." Its cap- tion reads "Centaure, statuette en bronze trouvée en Asie Mineure," and this is as far as most of the early writers on the centaur looked. By the time Paul V. C. Baur's Cen- taurs in Ancient Art came out, in 1912, the Morgan centaur was classed as Ionic, and Asia Minor was accepted as its provenance. But does Sambon really Say that the statuette was found in Asia Minor? I had long been familiar with the habit of some cataloguers of confusing style with provenance and replacing ethnic adjectives with geographical nouns. "Found in Asia Minor" would therefore be a com- mon mistranslation or mis-editing of the adjective "Ionian" or "Ionic," just as "style of Locri" almost invariably becomes "found at Locri" in certain nineteenth-century sale catalogues. To find the answer to the question one has to look at Sambon's article and not stop with the caption of the plate. I admit that it is not easy to identify the object in the text, but on page 6, in the section on centaurs with human forelegs but equine hoofs, he cites a Caeretan hydria in the Louvre (a detail of which is reproduced in his figure 5) and adds, "l'anse d'un vase archaïque en bronze trouvé en Italie." In this instance he gives no references to a bibliography or to one of his illustrations, and it is indeed odd that the only object illustrated in this article on a half- tone plate is nowhere mentioned specifically in the text. I suspect that the plate was an afterthought or that the connection was deliber- ately left obscure. After all, much of what was published in Le Musée was for sale, and the more impor- tant customers of those days pre- ferred objects that had not yet been talked to death. If we suppose that Sambon merely wanted to allude to the object, having in mind some- body like Mr. Morgan or Mr. Walters, the extra plate would have been enough to attract his attention, and the object itself would have been shown to this important client on his next visit. In any event, it is odd that the only line in the text that could possibly refer to the plate speaks of a handle of an Archaic bronze vase and specifies that it was found in Italy. The connection between plate and text becomes more convincing when we try to think of an Archaic bronze vase with a centaur as handle that was found in Italy; I have never seen any except the Morgan centaur that fits this description. The centaur is cast in one piece with its plinth, a shallow curved strip that was countersunk in a marble base. The curvature of the plinth, however, and its narrow- ness would be meaningless if the statuette were freestanding. This consideration long ago led me to believe that originally the centaur was soldered to the shoulder of a large bronze vessel (dinos), as in the case of the lion facing a boar in Boston, or the lion and bull on the dinos in Ancona (see W. LI. Brown, The Etruscan Lion [I960] 144-1 46). There is also the possibility that it was attached to the lid of a caul- dron of the type discussed by Riis and attributed by him to a Cam- panian workshop. (Collections of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek 2 [1938] 152 ff.). The convention of placing statu- ettes on the rims and shoulders of dinoi is not Greek, but has thus far been encountered only on vessels found - and presumably made - in Italy. Moreover, the style of the centaur is not Greek but more at home in those parts of Italy that were either ruled or dominated by Etruscans. The best parallels for the long face and both beard and 221</page><page sequence="6">Circular pit house at Sun House Hills site. hair occur in Etruscan art. Re- examination of the original publica- tions allows us to discount the provenance given in the caption and to replace it with the indication gleaned from the text; a better understanding of the function of the statuette and another look at its features confirm an Italic origin and justify a change in gallery and label. Dietrich von Bothmer Fellowship Awards 1967-68 The holder of the Olivia James Fellowship of the Archaeological Institute of America for the coming year is Donald R. Laing, Jr. of Western Reserve University. The subject of his study is to be "activities of the Athenians at sea from the late fifth century through the fourth century b.c." Four fellowships have been awarded this year by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foun- dation to scholars in archaeology or related fields. The fellows and their proposed studies are as follows: Peter H. von Blanckenhagen, New York University: The Graeco- Roman art of landscape painting; Richard Brilliant, University of Pennsylvania: The sculpture and coinage of the Roman empire, A.D. 37-68; William A. McDonald, Uni- versity of Minnesota: The human ecology of Messenia from the late Bronze Age to the present; Henry B. Nicholson, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles: The religion of Central Mexico in late Prehispanic times. The American Academy in Rome has recently announced the award of fifteen Rome Prize Fellowships for the coming academic year. Among the recipients of fellowships in Classical studies is Jacquelyn Collins, New York, whose project is a study of frontality in Roman art and the problem of its origin. The national honorary Classical fraternity, Eta Sigma Phi, has awarded two scholarships for the summer of 1967: to Francis Mar- tin Lazarus, Cornell University, who will attend the American Academy in Rome, and Paul David Kovacs, College of Wooster, Ohio, whose award has been aug- mented by the American School of Classical Studies to attend its sum- mer program in Athens. Preceramic House in New Mexico The following report has been furnished by Stewart Peckham, Associate Curator of the Museum of New Mexico: Until about fifteen years ago ar- chitectural remains of the preceramic peoples of the American South- west were known only in the Basket Maker caves of the Four Corners area of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado, and in scattered loca- tions along either side of the south- ern reaches of the boundary com- mon to the first two states. In recent years a number of important dis- coveries of such early dwellings have been made near Vernon and Houck, Arizona, and on the upper drainages of the San Juan River in northern New Mexico and ad- jacent Colorado. The most recent find of a dwell- ing of the pre-pottery period was made near the modern Keresan pueblo of Laguna, about forty-five miles west of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Here, at the Sun House Hills site, an excavation was con- ducted by Stewart Peckham and Robert Alexander of the Museum of New Mexico. The burned remains of a shallow circular pit house were unearthed. Measuring four meters in diameter, the structure had a single central roof support, a basin hearth and a stubby entryway on its east side. Such features are basic to the early dwellings of the Mogol- lon culture of southwestern New Mexico, and while the Sun House Hills site yielded no locally made pottery, contemporary inhabitants of Mogollon settlements 60-100 miles south and west probably were already adept at pottery making. Near the pit house are clusters of deep undercut pits of which about half of a total of forty were cleared in 1966. Most of the pits are about a meter in diameter and pro- vide little indication of their in- tended function. None contained sufficient fire-cracked rocks to sug- gest their use as roasting pits, and neither pits nor pit house yielded vegetal food remains. The confor- mation of the site implies a seden- tary life such as might have been required if its inhabitants were maize growers. If this was the case, the pits may have been for grain storage. A few of the pits are large enough to have served as dwellings, and two pits saw secondary use as repositories for semi -flexed burials. Another skeleton, extended supine, lay beneath the floor of the pit house and was covered with a long, nar- row sandstone slab. Two smudges of hematite near one end of the broadest surface of the slab had the semblance of eyes, as if a crude anthropomorphic or deific representation had been intended. Aside from a single bone awl, artifacts from the site are of stone. Grinding implements are well rep- resented, although for some unex- 222</page><page sequence="7">plained reason the nether grinding stones ( metates ) outnumber the handstones, a reversal of the usual situation in the Southwest. Most flake tools show little or no refine- ment, although gravers, finely flaked bifacial knives and well ex- ecuted bladelets are common. Pro- jectile points are too few and too varied to permit clear-cut cultural and chronological inferences, though this scarcity may connote less reliance on a hunting economy. Substantial amounts of charcoal came from most of the structures excavated, and a sample from the pit house has been submitted for a radiocarbon determination. Judging from the architecture and artifacts, it seems unlikely that the site dates earlier than the fourth or fifth cen- tury of our era. Although the pit house at the Sun House Hills site shows a rela- tionship to the Mogollon culture, too little is known of the attributes and sequence of events of the pre- ceramic period in the Laguna dis- trict for it to be considered as clearly Mogollon, Cochise (the pre- pottery ancestor of the Mogollon culture) or Anasazi. Although the Laguna district was subsequently occupied by Anasazi people, it is not particularly surprising to find a typically Mogollon dwelling in that area. Reconnaissance by Dr. A. E. Dittert, Jr. has demonstrated that contact between these two cul- tures was established in this region at a very early date and was main- tained in varying degrees as long as the Mogollon culture could be recognized as a separate cultural entity. The Sun House Hills site was only one of nine excavated in late 1966 as part of the Museum of New Mexico's highway archaeologi- cal salvage program. In the past thirteen years over one thousand sites within or near highway rights- of-way have been recorded. Through complete or partial excavation, 137 of these sites have been rescued from unrecorded oblivion. The Museum's archaeological salvage projects got their start in 1950, and they have maintained a steady pace during the past seven- teen years, occasionally through the agency of the School of American Research. All told, over five thou- sand sites have been catalogued, 315 subsequently excavated. Construc- tion of new highways, pipelines, powerlines, schools, urban develop- ments and the like continue to re- quire New Mexico archaeologists to be vigilant lest the state's prehistoric and historic resources be obliterated. Such problems are not unique to New Mexico - they are world-wide. Mycenaean Congress The First International Congress of Mycenaeology will be held in Rome, September 27-October 3, 1967. The date, first announced as September 21-27, has been post- poned in order to avoid conflicting with the Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy to be held in Cam- bridge, England. Reports and papers are to be arranged in three sections: archae- ology, philology and history. Re- ports have been promised for the archaeological section by N. Platon, Sp. Marinatos and D. Levi; for the philological group by E. L. Bennett, J. Chadwick, M. Lejeune, C. Gal- la votti, O. Masson, VI. Georgiev and L. R. Palmer; for the histori- cal section by V. d'A. Desborough, M. S. Ruipérez and G. Pugliese- Carratelli. The Executive Committee of the Congress states that scientific and educational institutions in every country may be represented by one or more qualified scholars as official delegates. The official address of the Congress is c/o Centro di Studi Micenei, University of Rome, Rome, Italy. Archaeology in Orbit [The author of the following account of a fascinating new possi- bility for scientific aid to archae- ology is Professor Henry O. Thomp- son of Syracuse University, whose article, "Science and Archaeology" in the Bibi cal Archaeologist (29 [1966] 114-125) provides valuable information and bibliography on other scientific techniques.] In September 1966 the United States Department of the Interior released a report on a project called Earth Resources Observation Satel- lite, abbreviated EROS. Whatever the initials may imply, the Depart- ment's intention is to gather infor- mation on natural resources via satellite. The satellite, the launching date of which was set for 1969 but may be moved up to 1968, will be equipped with television cameras, radar equipment and cameras with various types of sensor films such as infrared. As I read of the plans to study mineral resources, forest reserves, water pollution, etc., it occurred to me that if a satellite could be used to collect this type of information, why not archaeological data also? It may seem a bit odd to go two hundred miles up in the sky to find out what is underneath the ground. However, several things made the idea appear feasible. Aerial viewing and photography have made extensive contributions to archaeological discovery over the past several decades. In 1966 Dr. George Mendenhall, then director of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, carried out some aerial photography with in- frared film in Jordan. Dr. Froelich Rainey, director of the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, has recently used the Air Force's new multi-band camera in his search for ancient Sybaris in southern Italy. This combination of develop- ments led me to approach the Proj- ect EROS Director, Dr. William T. Pecora, as well as Dr. Rainey about using EROS for archaeologi- cal exploration. After some corre- spondence the two men were able to meet and discuss the matter. They concluded that the idea is not only feasible but has an extremely excit- ing potential. Five hundred standard airplane aerial photographs (which must then be carefully fitted to- gether to form a mosaic) are re- quired in order to cover the terri- tory included in a single satellite picture. The efficiency of the latter is obvious. The discovery of archae- ological remains from the air de- pends heavily on light and shadow effects. This is true for both the standard and the new sensor types of photography. Between the time a plane flies over a strip of the earth and then returns to photo- graph the parallel area next to it, light and shadows over the area have changed. A satellite picture records the entire scene with the same light. The variation in vegetation as seen from the air is another factor of importance for the archaeologist. Where the soil is deeper, growth is more luxuriant and where the soil 223</page><page sequence="8">is shallower, as over a wall or other archaeological feature, the vegeta- tion is less so. This, of course, varies with the seasons. The signifi- cance of this is currently being demonstrated by aerial survey work being done in Germany. The advan- tage of EROS will be its ability to cover any spot on the globe at any time - weekly or daily if need be. With this kind of potential, it would take a computer just to process the data obtained. Currently under consideration are plans and suggestions for prelim- inary work with known sites, jungles and underwater remains. The jungle areas of Central Amer- ica, Africa and Southeast Asia are rich in archaeological possibilities. Several of the countries in these regions are taking new interest in their history as well as in the development of archaeological sites for tourism. This suggests that they might welcome this type of "ex- ploration" of their lands. So far as I have been able to de- termine, aerial photography has not been much used for underwater archaeology. It seems a natural next step in this rapidly developing dis- cipline. EROS is already planning on peering beneath the waves to study the formation of coral reefs. Ships have foundered on reefs, and the study of wrecks is a major aspect of underwater archaeology. EROS could easily include the study of wrecks along with the study of reefs. Similarly, the search for minerals, such as iron ore under the Great Lakes, could well be ex- panded to look for ships that have sunk in our great inland "seas." The search for Sodom and Gomor- rah of biblical fame under the waters of the Dead Sea, the study of remains like Port Royal and of harbor installations could be a con- siderable boon to the archaeological world. It is well known that ancient settlements tended to develop on rivers and near good harbors. At the same time, we know that rivers occasionally shift their beds and harbors silt up. A study of such geological features, the formation of shorelines and deltas, may be a guide to the discovery of settle- ments. The location of irrigation dams and ditches will not only be a clue to ancient settlement but may be of value to modern agri- culturalists as well. So, too, the location of water resources in des- ert regions, or in relation to already known sites, may benefit the people there today. EROS would not be able to eliminate ground survey work but it could make it a good deal quicker and hence cheaper. Closely related to survey work are aerial, stereo and contour maps. EROS could produce accurate maps almost instantane- ously. The value of this to archae- ology is readily apparent. EROS and related satellite photography will not eliminate lower altitude aerial photography but will supple- ment it. A satellite may locate fea- tures that aircraft can then look at more closely. One of the less publicized aspects of government activity is the federal government's role in archaeology. It is increasing every year in many ways. To the growing list of its activities we might well have to add Project EROS. In recent decades archaeology has been making more and more use of modern technological develop- ments, particularly electronics. If preliminary work proves fruitful, the next bold and fascinating addi- tion to the list of such developments will be archaeology from outer space, archaeology in orbit. Michael Ventris Award The Michael Ventris Memorial Award for 1966 for Mycenaean Studies has been made to Mr. P. Hynding (University of Copen- hagen). This award is given in alternate years for archaeological studies. A supplementary award from the Memorial Fund has been made to Dr. Paola Pelagatti (of the Soprintendenza alle Antichità, Syra- cuse). Award to E. R. Caley Earle R. Caley, professor of chem- istry at Ohio State University, has for many years been interested in applying chemical techniques of analysis to ancient metal objects. He is best known for his work in analyzing the composition of Greek and Roman coins and has published extensively in the field of archae- ological chemistry. Professor Caley has recently been presented with the 1966 Dexter Award in recognition of his work. This award, established in 1956 by the Dexter Chemical Corporation and administered by the American Chemical Society, Division of History of Chemistry, is given each year "to generate further interest in the history of chemistry." It includes a prize of one thousand dollars and a plaque. t_T • / / • / r .
