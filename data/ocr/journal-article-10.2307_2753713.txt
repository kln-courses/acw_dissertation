<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion Modern China RELIGION in China appears to have been comparatively quiet in the twentieth century. Yet there have been great changes-images thrown out, temples wrecked, religious institutions abolished. From some points of view the changes are anti-religious; but they are also positive and construc- tive. The religious situation is both complicated and puzzling and this book 1 sets out to examine the position in the last fifty years in regard to Confucian- ism, Buddhism, Taoism and Islam. To the young, Confucianism belongs to the past; as a secular institution which has sponsored traditional rites it has been definitely overthrown. The coup de grace was delivered by leaders of the Intellectual Renaissance which began in 1917-Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Hu Shih. In the Manchu period, Con- x Religious Trends in Modern China.

Mao Tse-tung attacks Con- fucianism as semi-feudal, but he advises his party members to learn from Confucious and Sun Yat-sen as well as from Marx and Lenin. Nevertheless, the Communist government has abolished the national holiday of Confucius. What the situation will be after the storms are past, we cannot tell. Reforms in Chinese Buddhism were brought about under the leadership of the abbot, Tai-hsu (i889-i947). Aroused by the destruction of the temples, he "launched a movement to defend the religion, protect the faith, reform the order and promote education." Buddhism was never a national institution until i9i2, when a lay association was established which criticised the inabil- ity of Buddhist clergy to up-hold their religion. The clergy formed a society of their own, the first national organization of Chinese priests. Apathy and inefficiency soon vitiated both, and they fell into oblivion. In i929 the Chinese Buddhist Society was founded by T'ai-hsu but its organization was both loose and weak. Many monks have fled to Hong Kong, and they claim that 200,000 younger monks have been drafted to "fight for the New Democracy." These figures, though probably exaggerated, show in what a plight the Buddhists find themselves. One new form of Buddhism is that of Hsiung Shih-li. He started with Buddhism but developed towards Confucianism. Like Wang Yang-ming and others, he sees complete harmony between the two systems, and in turning Buddhist doctrines to Confucian ends Hsiung represents a new tendency in contemporary Chinese thought. No one can tell how it will develop nor how it will fare in the future, but its activities indicate that Bud- dhist thought is still vital and even goes forth in new directions. Chinese religion has been a religion of the masses. As for Taoism, we know the founding of the Taoist religion in A.D. i43 was but the culmina- tion of an age-old movement promoted among the masses for several hun- dred years before the Christian era. It is surprising how few religious leaders China has produced. But re- ligion has lived, and continues to live, because it has been carried on by the simple folk of China, who represent some 85 percent of the population. The masses follow the beliefs and practices of the three systems and join various religious societies with Taoism as the centre. The decline of Taoism is tantamount to the collapse of the people's re- ligion as a whole. The real spirit is dead and its vitality is fast disappearing. Lack of leadership and lack of a modern programme are causes. There is no Taoist priest of anything like the calibre of T'ai-hsu and while Buddhism and Islam, following Christianity, attempted some sort of a social programme in educational, medical and philanthropic services, Taoism remained inactive. Nevertheless, Taoism still persists as a guiding principle in art and in festivals, and it will maintain its powerful influence on the Chinese people. 8o</page><page sequence="3">Religion In Modern China The Islamic minority in China is a large one and certain trends are ob- servable. These are (i) a tendency towards liberalism-the Chinese Muslims advocate modernism and the wearing of European-style clothes; (2) new attitudes towards the Koran-they study it outside services and study it in Chinese; (3) intellectual awakening-the use of Chinese in general educa- tion; (4) closer identification with nature and life. Islam in the past has been influenced to some extent by Confucianism. The future development of Chinese Islam may not be Confucian, but, if the transformation of Buddhism can be taken as a precedent, it is almost sure to become Chinese. Most Chinese intellectuals frown on superstition, idolatry, belief in origi- nal sin, Creation, an anthropomorphic god, heavens and hells, and miracles. It was, therefore, not surprising that they started an anti-Christian movement in 1922. Critics of Christianity have been classified as rationalists, nationalists and Communists. Among the rationalists is Hu Shih, who believes that philosphy is superior to all religion. Among the nationalists are Tsing Ch'i and Li Huang, who view Christianity primarily as an instrument of Western exploitation. The Communists combine both lines of argument and add that "Christianity is not suitable to Chinese needs." Freedom of religion is supposed to be .guaranteed by the People's Re- public. On the other hand, there are evidences of a state control of religious life, the government openly persecuting the Catholic religion through the closing of churches, confiscation of property and the expulsion and execution of missionaries. It has required all churches to sever their ties with the West and is endeavouring to make Christian doctrine conform to Marxism. "Will the Communist rulers force Marxism on the Chinese intellectuals as a state religion?" We do not know the answer and, though we suspect they will, we do not know what the results will be. All we can say is that, if history repeats itself, the Chinese intellectuals will have neither a state religion nor a scien- tific or aesthetic substitute for religion. They will keep their own kind of religion going and will keep it free. Dr. Chan's book is full of interesting material, and is written by a man who travelled in China in i948-49 and gathered much of his information from obscure-and since inaccessible-sources. He left China in I936 and since then has lectured in Hawaii and other parts of the United States on Chinese culture and philosophy. He shows the trends of religion to be both positive and negative, and in his concluding chapter, he attempts to formulate the basic creed of the intellectuals who have had the most important influence on religion. Dr. Chan believes that, despite Communism, there lies a hope for a re-emergence of strong religious beliefs. London School of Oriental and African Studies E. D. EDWARDS</page></plain_text>
