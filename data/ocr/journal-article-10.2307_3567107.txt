<plain_text><page sequence="1">Visual Anthropology REVIEW ESSAYS Seeing Green: Knowing and Saving the Environment on Film LUIS A. VIVANCO University of Vermont It is clear that the mass media plays a crucial role in the construction and communication of environmental prob- lems and solutions. There can be little doubt, for example, that the rise of tropical deforestation as an international political problem and site of transnational civic activism is due in no small part to the circulation of mass media rep- resentations, especially in the North (O'Connor 1997; Stepan 2001). It is also apparent that not all media are cre- ated and consumed equally. Knowledge of environmental problems relies heavily on nonmediagenic mechanisms of claims making and expert knowledge, and so the mass me- dia often features spectacular and dramatic visual events or processes to draw attention to such claims (Hansen 1993). In other words, we can be told that rain forests are disap- pearing at alarming rates, but the often-cited statistics are not as compelling until one has actually seen the destruc- tion. For example, because they "show" dramatically on film, environmental problems in a place like Costa Rica (the site of my ethnographic research) are often communi- cated mainly as the loss of wilderness and species through deforestation, at the expense of less visually appealing ac- tivities like pesticide abuses resulting from inadequate regulation of multinational agricultural industries like ba- nanas (Hilje et al. 1987; Thrupp 1990; Vivanco 1999). Given the complex role of environmental and media bureaucracies in defining and communicating environ- mental problems (Chapman et al. 1997; Wapner 1996), the linkages between media representations and environ- mental activism are difficult to measure and easy to over- state. Such connections do provoke interesting questions, though, specifically around how "the environment" is represented visually, and the destruction and conservation of nature in the cinematic imagination. What are the vari- ous ways that natural processes are represented on film, and what do they tell us about the compatibility of nature and film? What are the problems posed by depicting envi- ronmental degradation and solutions to it on film? How can documentary film, with its conventional stylistic com- mitment toward realism and objectivity, represent envi- ronmental issues in cultural contexts in which ways of knowing and representing nature and social change can be quite distinct from those of Westerners? This essay considers how such questions are currently being treated in films and film studies whose main con- cern is in a broad sense "environmental." The repre- sentation of nature as a conservation and management problem is intertwined with the invention, development, and commodification of cinematic technologies,1 and en- vironmental films offer a privileged site to consider how nature and its problems are visualized at the crossroads of science, popular education; art, and business. Yet there is no unified genre of "environmental films" with its own codes, structures, or even topics, which can range from the dangers of nuclear energy in industrial societies to wild animals in their habitats. My emphasis here is mainly on documentary works from the past five years so that I may provide information on recent releases of potential inter- est to anthropologists. What these works have in common is that they are "stories about stories about nature" (Cronon 1992), blending carefully crafted scientific and educational perspectives (and pretensions) with norma- tive visions of the causes and consequences of environ- mental degradation. In their efforts to draw attention to potential solutions, they also play on (and sometimes challenge) iconic differentiations and conflicts between peoples, portraying morality tales of Third World peoples living in an either destructive or harmonious relationship with nature, and of heroic environmental activists strug- gling against forces of history. In the visions and argu- ments they articulate, these films provide useful grounds to consider what Escobar has called "the irruption of the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST 104(4): 1195-1204. COPYRIGHT ? 2002, AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION</page><page sequence="2">1196 American Anthropologist * Vol. 104, No. 4 * December 2002 biological" (1997:41), or the global emergence of nature's survival as a central political, ethical, and capitalist prob- lem, and the role of the environment as an increasingly significant site of cultural production and catalyst of con- flict, dialogue, and alternatives around the world. THE FANTASIES OF NATURAL HISTORY FILM It is widely accepted that wildlife and natural history films are environmentally committed documentaries (Bouse 2000). Two recent complementary books on the subject- Wildlife Films (2000), by cinema historian Derek Bouse, and Reel Nature: America's Romance with Wildlife on Film (1999), by historian of science Gregg Mitman-challenge this notion, asserting that the portrayal of nature on film and television generally takes shape as fictionalized narra- tives produced in a highly competitive corporate media marketplace. In fact, both reject the notion that these are documentaries at all, showing that since their origins in the early 20th century, these films have adopted devices, themes, and thrills of mainstream entertainment to ensure commercial success. Bous6, who calls them "docu-dramas," observes, For whether in two minutes or two hours, in a promo- tional trailer or a detailed natural history study, in non- narrative montages or in elaborately plotted dramatic sto- ries, wildlife film and television depict nature close-up, speeded-up, and set to music, with reality's most enticing moments highlighted, and its "boring" bits cut out. [2000:2-3] A central theme for both authors is the constitutive tension in natural history films between the fakery of simulated spectacle and the objectivity of science. Con- sider the recent public furor over revelations that Marty Stouffer, one of America's preeminent wildlife filmmakers, abused animals, staged scenes, and defiled public lands in the filming of his "Wild America" series. What this re- vealed, argues Mitman, "is how firmly Americans wish and expect nature films to be the real thing" (1999:204), based on unadulterated access to authentic and unspoiled landscapes and animals. Filmmakers themselves acknow- ledge that their products are somewhere between, as Bous&amp; suggests, representation and simulation. He quotes cam- eraman Stephen Mills: When we film lions gorging on a bloody zebra in the Ser- engeti, or a cheetah flat out after a bounding gazelle, we rarely turn the cameras on the dozen or so Hiace vans and land-rovers, packed with tourists sharing the wilderness experience. All over the world we frame our pictures as carefully as the directors of costume dramas, to exclude telegraph poles and electricity pylons, cars, roads, and people. No such vestige of reality may impinge on the pe- riod-piece fantasy of the natural world we wish to purvey. [Bous6 2000:14] The fantasy is reinforced by other techniques of camera placement and editing, such as concealing the camera and using telephoto lenses to capture "natural behaviors," (Fig- ure 1) using artificial lighting, and applying stock sounds during editing (Mitman 1999:24). Just as important is the dramatic framework around which films are organized. The archetypal narrative struc- ture of so-called blue-chip (classic) wildlife films is bio- graphical and individualistic, tracing the individual from birth, through the perils of youth, trials of adolescence, adulthood, and death (Mitman 1999:131). Narratives about animal relationships often focus either on Darwin- ian "survival of the fittest" themes that emphasize the in- evitability of individual acts of aggression and violence (what Andrew Ross [1994] calls the "Chicago Gangster Theory of Life") or, on animal kinship relations, in which culturally preferred notions of monogamy, responsible parenting, industrious work ethic, deferred gratification, and the sexual division of labor are presented. Especially violent and sexualized scenes deemed excessive for broad- cast television audiences are self-censored, and sometimes sold separately as "outtakes." In effect, these films place a mirror in the face of Americans and-surprise!--they find their dominant cultural assumptions and ideals reflected in nature, even though the fields of reference the films create are a world apart from viewers' lives (Price 1999). Within the industry, where films are as much commodities as educational tools, the self-conscious dilemma is that if filmmakers reveal these strategies, audiences who partici- pate in the fantasy of wild nature will be disillusioned.2 The blurring between showmanship and science re- flects the fluid boundaries between the uses of film as a re- search and educational tool within the sciences and the rise of film as a technology of mass communication and entertainment during the past century (Mitman 1999:60). Like early ethnographic films, nature films have been pro- moted as scientific records that preserve a natural heritage being lost to the forces of modernity (Mitman 1999:27). Scientists and filmmakers self-consciously placed limits on showmanship early on, as seen in the professional con- demnation of Martin and Osa Johnson, who often staged nature as a spectacle of death and struggle in their films. Ironically, this has also meant that the scientific validity of films relies on perceptions of the filmmaker's virtue and integrity. Ethologist Konrad Lorenz, for example, brought his integrity to the well-respected Encyclopedia Cinema- tographica (Wolf 1952), whose goal was to document single "typical" behaviors of individual species usually around acts of communication. As Bous6 argues, this technique promoted a showman's tendency to distill the natural world into a series of dramatic movements on film (he calls it "canned behavior"), later conventionalized in wild- life films through close-up shots that simultaneously de- contextualize acts and promote feelings of intimacy and anthropomorphism (2000:72). Both authors express gravitas when they consider the implications of these films for environmental change. Mitman is worried that they draw from and reinforce a gap between reality and expectation, whose root lies in a deep incompatibility between nature and the commercial impetus of the film industry. He observes, "Nature is not all action.... Conditioned by nature on screen, we may</page><page sequence="3">Visual Anthropology 1197 :~ " "i''  "?L ii.

Mangelsen, On Nature's Terms, Bullfrog Films). fail to develop the patience, perseverance, and passion re- quired to participate in the natural world with all its mun- danity as well as splendor" (Mitman 1999:207). Referring to the biographical structure and culturally specific themes that consistently show up in films, Bouse worries, "When moral values are presumed applicable to nature, their uni- versalizing is complete. They become absolute, no longer moral values at all, but moral truths" (2000:159). In the end, perhaps because his work is more focused on the technical and institutional aspects of how filmmakers cre- ate nature as wild, Bouse is more cautious than Mitman about the presumed linkages between television viewing and the environmental movement. These books provide crucial perspectives on the his- torical and institutional contexts in which dominant cine- matic images of nature are reproduced and distributed, but there is a frustrating lack of attention to the diverse audiences that watch natural history films. Mitman's America is mainly white and middle class, and his conclu- sions about the meanings of nature films for viewers are more speculative than tested. More importantly, given the circulation of such films and their images beyond the United States, one wonders about viewer reception in the places that are portrayed as unpeopled (think East African savannas or rain forests), where there are ongoing strug- gles over access to resources desired as wilderness reserves. FRAMING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION Processes of environmental degradation carry an aura of crisis, usually confirmed on film by images of destruction- in-progress. Natural history films, for example, communi- cate an animal's prospects of individual (and group) sur- vival by inserting cut-and-paste stock images of habitat destruction like logging.3 Yet relatively few films dedicate themselves solely to the theme, perhaps because audi- ences do not respond well to pessimistic "doom and gloom" scenarios (Bouse 2000:16). The tendency in most is to briefly establish the problem on their way to examine solutions, reflecting an ideology of constructive engage- ment based on action (Grierson 1979). Lost in such a strat- egy can be an understanding of the differentiated and het- erogeneous causes, consequences, and experiences of environmental degradation. Any number of examples could serve to illustrate this point, but consider the recent film On Nature's Terms (de Graaf 2001), which explores the challenges to large predatory mammals in the United States. The film argues that wolves, pumas, and bears are "keystone species," or important indicators of healthy ecosystems, because they require so much open space and</page><page sequence="4">1198 American Anthropologist * Vol. 104, No. 4 * December 2002 regulate other animal populations. Prejudicial attitudes, government policies, and suburban sprawl, however, have contributed to their extermination, with consequential impacts on ecosystem health. That is more or less the ex- tent of it; the film then presents how citizen action is con- serving lands and contributing to species preservation. In arguing for the effectiveness of citizen action, it provides no detail on the contours of Americans' changing atti- tudes toward predators and predator loss, much less the diverse political and social meanings people make of argu- ments about predators and their roles in ecosystems. Presentations on degradation often take shape through discourses of blame in service to a specific solution (Hoben 1995; Leach and Mearns 1996; Roe 1991), such as focusing on deforestation or poaching to justify the creation of ab- solute protection preserves. Two recent films claim both a fuller presentation on processes of degradation and con- found the easy assignation of blame by focusing on the heterogeneous ways people experience and participate in environmental degradation. The first, Since the Company Came (Hawkins 2000), takes place on Rendova in the Solo- mon Islands, where a Malaysian logging company has been cutting and exporting tropical timber. The film's opening frames feature a man cutting down a tree with a chainsaw (a common scene to evoke larger destruction) and then cut to an emotionally charged meeting of the in- digenous Haforai Development Corporation in which vil- lagers are vigorously debating a decision to renew their contract with the Malaysian company. The film is organ- ized loosely around this meeting from a fly-on-the-wall perspective and interspersed with villager interviews. Ex- cept for some brief intercuts of an early-20th-century si- lent film on the Solomons, the film never offers the views of non-Haforai (such as government officials, who at one point are accused of allowing the logging to continue, or of Malaysian logging company officials). Especially without an off-screen voice-over narration, the film validates "local people" as important actors with a range of perspectives on logging and its impacts, in con- trast to narratives that rely solely on experts to tell the story of degradation through objectivist language.4 It also highlights social rifts and conflicts that accompany defor- estation without falling into a common trap in environ- mentalist discourse on indigenous peoples: that environ- mental degradation leads to a unidimensional loss of culture. Gender politics is at the heart of this film's repre- sentation of conflict: While customary lands are inherited through matrilineage, men work as loggers and make deci- sions about logging contracts. The film depicts women who are especially critical of logging and resentful that their voices are ignored in decision making. According to one woman, "To us women, logging is destruction and pollution. We're affected by the pollution in the sea be- cause we collect seaweed to feed our children .... All our fishing grounds now, after logging, we don't have enough fish" (Hawkins 2000) We also see the outlines of an emerg- ing struggle over the formal conservation of the as-yet un- logged and uninhabited island of Tetepare, in which a young woman notifies the camera of plans to resist its fu- ture logging. What has changed in Rendova, according to some of the interviewees, are attitudes toward land and the increased importance of the cash economy. One woman asserts, People tend to think they don't get much out of the land, when in fact they rely on land for gardens, for all they need. Food, water, everything come from land, but they don't see money coming out of it, so they don't think they benefit from their land or their forest. [Hawkins 2000] Even some men who work as loggers are ambivalent about the industry and its effects, denying any easy divide be- tween "pro-" and "anti-" logging perspectives. According to one logger, the devastation is obvious ("rivers that were once crystal clear and now they are muddy" [Hawkins 2000]); and he blames it on the government that since in- dependence (1979) has pursued policies of export-driven resource extraction. Another logger observes that the problem is foreign domination itself: "Of course I cut down trees working as a logger, but I still think about the future too. ... Instead of accepting big logging compa- nies, Asian companies, we should have small mills and cut the timber ourselves" (Hawkins 2000). Where this film falters is in providing a richer context for claims like those above. For example, during the meet- ing, the chief mentions a history of failed Haforai business enterprises, but we have no context for Haforai attitudes toward and experiences with "business" and "develop- ment" (Watson-Gegeo and White 1990). Instead of pro- viding interviews that elucidate these themes, the film juxtaposes its present with old clips from a newsreel that celebrated the positive impacts of Lever Brothers and the plantation economy in bringing civilization and produc- tivity to the headhunters. The technique is common (Stock- ing 1992:398), and the filmmaker's suggestion is obvious: There is a historical continuity in which Solomon experi- ences with outside commerce and development are based on domination and the unilateral extraction of natural and labor resources. The title itself suggests that forces ex- ternal to the island are responsible for local destruction and conflicts; but because this film is not about "the com- pany" as a subject, it obscures the institutional, national, regional, and transnational linkages that help shape the context in which deforestation happens (Utting 1993). Unfortunately, this also reinforces a trope of "good tradi- tion" and "bad present," in which conflict in the present is naturalized as the product of dehistoricized foreign domination. A second film, Second Nature: Building Forests in West Africa's Savannas (Maughan 1996), is more attentive to place-specific categories and practices, focusing on how they differ from broader narratives of environmental deg- radation. Based on and featuring the research of anthro- pologists James Fairheard and Melissa Leach on the sa- vanna-forest mosaic landscape of Kissidougou prefecture,</page><page sequence="5">Visual Anthropology 1199 Guinea, West Africa, Second Nature adds to recent anthro- pological critiques of environmentalist and development crisis narratives that uncritically place blame on local eco- logical mismanagement and overpopulation (Fairhead and Leach 1996; Hoben 1995; Leach and Mearns 1996; Roe 1991). The first frames are self-conscious images of burn- ing trees, but the film quickly establishes that this burning is part of a careful regime of indigenous land management, not an ominous loss of biodiverse habitat.5 The point is to illustrate a provocative Boserupian discovery: What colo- nial and development officials have consistently inter- preted as a once-continuous forest fragmented by Malthu- sian population growth and native mismanagement is in fact a carefully constructed landscape of forest patches cul- tivated on grasslands, and the product of population growth itself. In the course of the film, forest stewards explain that the forests serve as protective fortresses around villages, as hunting grounds, to prevent grassland fires from reaching villages, and to improve grassland soils for cultivation. The point is that such elite misreadings of environmental history are not inconsequential: They underestimate the extent to which any landscape is constantly modified by human intentionality in ways that can even enhance biodi- versity and risk imposing ill-designed solutions on rural peoples (such as population control programs, instead of, say, technical support for reforestation). The reason to watch this film is not so much for inter- esting visual material, and it offers a rather conventional narrative of (in this case, anthropological) experts and lo- cals explaining stages in a process (forest growth) that be- cause of its historical basis is difficult to show. The film also suffers from the larger dilemmas of Fairhead and Leach's research, including ambiguity about whether or not farmers and scientists experience different objective realities and the methodological limits of using aerial pho- tography to make their case of forest expansion over time (Cleveland and Powell 1998:579). In its critical scrutiny of the nature-culture divide, however, it does raise the in- sight that environmental degradation itself cannot be con- sidered independently from specific ecological meanings, practices, and histories. More importantly, it lays effective groundwork for turning the lens on environmentalists and scientific authorities themselves. VISUALIZING GREEN CRUSADES Films about conservation efforts can have a formulaic David-and-Goliath quality, offering compelling visual ma- terial like conflicts between poachers and rangers, popular protests, and heroic activists struggling against oppressive bureaucratic forces. They also, however, inevitably raise basic questions (acknowledged or not) about what strate- gies will work to "save the environment," the forms of knowledge on which environmental practices are based and the social orders and hierarchies such practices imag- ine, and the role of the individual in promoting structural change. Furthermore, they communicate in visual and narrative terms basic tensions about the differences be- tween groups of people-especially their capacity to offer positive models of ecological wisdom-as well as normal- izing assumptions about who defines appropriate relation- ships to nature in conservation initiatives. A dominant narrative, as seen in National Geographic films like Save the Panda, set in China (Birch 1983), and The Rhino War, set in Kenya and Zimbabwe (Clayford 1987), focuses on the actions of morally enlightened indi- viduals whose goal is to save a species from the ignorance, greed, and overpopulation of local people. These films draw heavily on techniques of natural history films, in- cluding images of wildlife set to evocative music and dra- matic storylines of destruction and redemption, although they introduce a new element: the neocolonial figure of the adventurous and self-sacrificing white Westerner whose task is to objectively understand the animal and de- fend its conservation (a role played in Save the Panda by the famous conservation biologist George Schaller, and in The Rhino War by white excombatants in Zimbabwe's civil war). Both films portray rural people in insultingly sim- plistic ways: They are silent background figures, as in Save the Panda, where they have no relevant perspective on pandas and their main job is as porters or assistants for Western scientists; threatening and desperate poachers; or reconstructed allies of conservation who, especially in the case of The Rhino War, which is about the low-intensity warfare between poachers and park rangers, will put their and poachers' lives on the line to help save an animal for their country's national development. These films confirm two basic points familiar to natu- ral history film audiences: (1) that proper conservation is to set up parks managed by experts and patrolled by armed guards, supported by efforts to educate locals about natural resources while keeping them separate from each other; and (2) that individuals, with the appropriate knowledge (science) and equipment (radio transmitters and guns) can make a difference. The strong tendency to rely on racializ- ing stereotypes of Otherness, that in Save the Panda reaches absurd heights with orientalizing music and vaguely threatening descriptive language when referring to modern (Communist) China, supports a worldview in which wilderness conservation is the pinnacle of Western modernity. This has important consequences, one being that the complex histories and ecological knowledge of lo- cal people are deemed irrelevant, if not viewed as obstacles to overcome. As the The Rhino War seems to conclude, perpetual mistrust and even militarization are the sadly inevitable but justified result. The other is to homogenize conservation strategies and knowledge, confirming (erro- neously) that there are no debates over the effectiveness of, much less alternatives to, concepts of conservation ori- ented toward dispossession, a static landscape vision of absolute protectionism, and scientific interventionism.6 A common alternative to this overtly negative orien- talism and scientific triumphalism is the theme of the "green primitive," the romantic notion of the ecological</page><page sequence="6">1200 American Anthropologist * Vol. 104, No. 4 * December 2002 noble savage living in harmony with nature. The Penan of Sarawak, Malaysia, became international celebrities in this respect during the 1980s and 1990s when some of them resisted logging in their territories with the help of a Swiss adventurer named Bruno Manser. This story gained exten- sive media coverage, including BBC and National Geo- graphic films, and an influential 1988 Bullfrog Films release called Blowpipes and Bulldozers (Kendell and Tait 1988). This history is revisited in the Swedish documentary Tong Tana: The Lost Paradise (Roed et al. 2001). While the older films have the aura of urgency, the newer film offers a ret- rospective lament on the paradise Manser found, lost, and then sought to regain when the filmmakers accompany him back to Penan as he returns for "the final struggle" against logging. International attention to the Sarawak situation has often been based on an unapologetic romanticization of the Penan as pristine innocents and the remarkable ability of a courageous individual like Manser to help galvanize their resistance (Brosius 1999). The makers of Tong Tana admit that, like Manser, they have been seduced by a ro- mantic vision of the jungle and the splendid isolation of the Penan community they have come to help. Even while they see the Penan through Manser's eyes, they seem to have doubts about adopting his full-scale search for time- less primitives and gemeinschaft, pointing out that "Bruno is more Penan than the Penan themselves" (Roed et al. 2001). They also hint that the Sarawak struggle is more complex than the "FernGully allegory" (Brosius 1999) of films like Blowpipes and Bulldozers, in interviews with the minister of environment and a German sustainable for- estry official.' Both use bureaucratic language to criticize Manser's activism, though for different reasons: the gov- ernment official, on sovereignty grounds (reflecting the claims of ecoimperialism the Malaysian government used to effectively challenge the international Sarawak cam- paigns), and the sustainable forestry official on the grounds that, while Manser did help generate interna- tional pressure, he missed opportunities for capacity building among the Penan. The film concludes omi- nously, with the notification that Manser is probably dead, self-consciously identifying the end of a hopeful era of resistance among the Penan and affirming the grim re- ality that tropical forest and cultural destruction continue unimpeded. A central problem with green primitive allegories, though, and Tong Tana falls into this trap in spite of its own sense that it should not, is that the overwhelming de- sire for purity denies the voices and agency of the very people it claims to represent. The Penan are central players in this drama, yet we never find out in depth about what they think about either Manser or their situation. They are presented in characteristically unidimensional terms, as either nomadic (pure) or settled (contaminated and losing their culture), confounding more complex realities and in the process assigning them to the natural (not historical) side of the nature-culture divide. Consequently, we re- main ignorant of the divisions between Penan who allied with logging companies and Penan who allied with envi- ronmentalists as extensions of their own historical con- flicts with one another, as Peter Brosius has shown in his compelling research on the Sarawak campaign and Penan activism (1997, 1999). By ranging between romantic and bureaucratic languages, Tong Tana ultimately reinforces a broader depoliticization of rain forest conflicts, eliminat- ing the claims of those who do not conform to idealized images (Conklin 1997:728) while validating interventions defined within bureaucratic institutions (Brosius 1999). As Conklin has pointed out, representations and self- presentations of indigenous authenticity can have their rewards in ecopolitics. Exotic peoples in traditional dress and body decoration offer keen visual material, marking indigenous difference and identity in ways that affirm their closeness to nature (1999:722-723). As documented in the work of Terence Turner (1992) and in the films Kayapo: Out of the Forest (Beckham 1989) and Geoffrey O'Connor's Amazon Journal (O'Connor 1995), Kayap6 have gained international media celebrity by playing up the role of green primitive and noble savage in Western environmentalist discourse, which provided leverage that enabled them a new level of political opportunities and influence, including success persuading the World Bank to not loan the Brazilian government funds for the Altamira dam. At the same time, the spread of representational and communications technologies have created opportunities for indigenous groups to represent themselves in ways in- formed by their own aesthetics of social production and value, actively placing themselves at the intersection of cinematic imagery and ecopolitics. Nevertheless, as the Kayap6 and other marginalized groups have discovered, there are trade-offs involved in aiming such symbolic poli- tics at international audiences, including the dilemma of playing roles handed to them by dominant discourses that prohibit variation from idealized imagery. Furthermore, the success of international campaigns can become a li- ability at the national level where the claims of marginal- ized or minority peoples often represent a challenge to the legitimacy and hegemony of the modern states that en- compass them (Conklin 1997:725; van den Berghe 1992).8 Surely, environmental activism is not a static or in- flexible arena, and it is a highly complicated and even contradictory site of cultural politics and social produc- tion. In the era of "sustainable development," mainstream environmental institutions and funding agencies have be- gun to openly acknowledge that stark separations between people and nature, and alternatively simplistic divides be- tween primitive peoples and modern society, which col- lapse indigenous societies into nature, do not necessarily lead to effective conservation initiatives. Evicting people from the landscape and disrupting traditional productive activities can disempower and impoverish the very com- munities conservation claims to benefit, thereby generat- ing new threats to nature.9 So there is a growing realiza- tion that conservation is not simply about what kind of</page><page sequence="7">Visual Anthropology 1201 nature activists imagine or know they want to preserve or restore; it is also an important arena in which they, explic- itly or implicitly, project and reimagine community, po- litical-economic relationships, and social justice. Reflecting some of these shifts is a new film that has generated substantial popular and festival attention since its release in 2001. The Shaman's Apprentice (Smith 2001) (Figure 2) focuses on the work of Dr. Mark Plotkin, a North American ethnobotanist who started an Amazonian con- servation program called "The Shaman's Apprentice" that seeks to facilitate the transmission of ecological and me- dicinal knowledge from indigenous elders to young peo- ple in an effort to preserve and regenerate Amazonian cul- tures and secure biodiversity conservation. Narrated by Susan Sarandon, the film trades on the considerable public curiosity about shamanism, mixing techniques like dra- matic reenactments, slow motion, archival images, sepia maps, images of sublime nature, and so on, with objec- tivist storytelling in a documentary format. Recounting episodes from his book Tales ofa Shaman's Apprentice, Plot- kin is the hero at the center of the film, demonstrating the subtle and encyclopedic knowledge of healers and discuss- ing through interviews the lamentable fact that such knowledge is dying because young people are taught to re- vere Western medicine over shamanism. He tells us, "The most endangered species in the Amazon is the shaman himself.... When a shaman dies, it's like a library burn- ing down." Mixed metaphors aside-native peoples are natural- ized as "endangered species" and civilized as "libraries"-- this film substantiates claims of sophisticated indigenous Figure 2. Ethnobotanist Dr. Mark Plotkin (rear) with the Jaguar Shaman "Tamo" and Amashina, Tirio people in Suriname (Miranda Productions, The Shaman's Apprentice, Bullfrog Films). intimacy with biodiversity that green primitive narratives only imply and other conservation films ignore. As self- conscious salvage ethnographer, Plotkin urges us to con- sider the empirical rigor of shamanistic biochemistry ("they're better chemists than us in certain instances"), and argues that Western medicine's materialistic bias and search for magic bullets prevents a holistic understanding of disease etiology and the subtle and comprehensive un- derstanding of nature among indigenous healers. In a reenacted scene from the book (that also inspired a scene in Sean Connery's The Medicine Man), we see Plotkin's con- version from skeptic to believer in a dream episode where he is visited by a shaman, which demonstrates the impor- tance of dreams to shamanistic ecological and medicinal knowledge. As a result, Plotkin self-consciously sets him- self up as a scientist-hero: a renegade, sophisticated in the ways of the locals, and not afraid to critique the epistemo- logical limitations of his own knowledge to get at the heart of the problem. Plotkin also knows that his audience (and funders) will include skeptics, and so he is careful to validate Western science's objective methodologies, in- cluding demonstrations of how a botanist prepares an her- barium and translations of indigenous cures into bio- chemical categories. What remain inexcusably hazy in this film are issues concerning indigenous collective property and traditional resource rights, and the controversial politics and eco- nomics around the patenting of indigenous knowledge and plants in international trade regimes that tend to fa- vor pharmaceutical industry interests. Plotkin admits that ethnobotany has been what he calls "a rape and run enter- prise," although the reason for saying this is less to ex- plore how and why it continues, than it is to set up his own conservation program as mutually beneficial solution for indigenous peoples (it perpetuates their culture) and ethnobotany (it learns a lot about cures for disease). At the end of the credits, a statement vaguely answers a question that haunts the rest of the film: "ACT [Plotkin's Ama- zonian Conservation Team] does not engage in bio- prospecting" (Smith 2001). Amazingly, the film does not define, much less acknowledge, the rise of bioprospecting and biopiracy. It therefore does not place "The Shaman's Apprentice" program in the wider context of growing awareness of the problems associated with bioprospecting and the political-economic inequalities that underlie them. These include no or poor compensation to commu- nities by the capitalist enterprises that process and market the products of bioprospecting, payments to individuals and not collectives, and outright illegal collection of plants and appropriation of knowledge (Shiva 1997). The film also ignores the galvanization of indigenous peoples around these problems, some of whom are forming strict collection guidelines, creating networks and centers that advocate for the protection of ecological and medicinal knowledge, and, in celebrated instances, internationally denouncing questionable practices and the abuses of bio- prospecting, such as the recent situation in Chiapas in</page><page sequence="8">1202 American Anthropologist * Vol. 104, No. 4 * December 2002 which University of Georgia ethnobotanists clashed with indigenous peoples organizations (and ultimately failed to get permission to conduct bioassays on collected plant materials) (Action Group on Erosion, Technology, and Concentration [ETC Group] 2001). These debates and new movements point to a broader trend in which indigenous activists and communities have been acting in coordinated ways to produce and con- trol representations of themselves and their relationships with their environments. This is especially the case in the arena of ecotourism, in which some indigenous peoples have been actively contesting the mainstream acceptance of ecotourism as a strategy for sustainable economic devel- opment, cultural preservation, and nature conservation. The UN's declaration of 2002 as the "International Year of Ecotourism" has intensified these organizing efforts, lead- ing to several international meetings this year (in Thailand and Oaxaca, Mexico) and the organization of the Indige- nous Tourism Network, in which indigenous representa- tives have vocalized their concerns about the conse- quences of ecotourism development on their cultural integrity, land rights, and self-determination. At the Inter- national Forum on Indigenous Tourism, held in Oaxaca during March 2002, for example, participants pointed to ecotourism as a rationale that governments and interna- tional agencies (including bioprospectors) use to gain ac- cess to or control over indigenous lands, as well as the un- equal participation of indigenous representatives in planning projects. Other negative impacts include poorly distributed profits, greenwashing, the overuse of habitat by tourists, and outright destruction of habitat to create tourism infrastructure (Vivanco 2002, in press). The alternative visions of tourism emerging out of gatherings like the one in Oaxaca are not based on the re- jection of tourists and ecotourism per se, but the rejection of the industry's market-driven universalism. More impor- tantly, they affirm the diverse and nonprescriptive ways indigenous communities can engage in tourism to support and communicate their goals of cultural and political self- determination. The experience of Yavesia, a small village in the Sierra Juarez of Oaxaca, is indicative of this active appropriation and redefinition of ecotourism. The com- munity has resisted creating "attractions" simply to bring tourists (who are allowed to visit community-owned forest land with local guides) and view their involvement in tourism as a chance to share stories about their steward- ship of the landscape. Conscious of the tendency of tour- ism to displace other productive activities, the project is integrated into other uses of the forest, including a spring- water bottling plant and the collection of nontimber for- est products. Decisions regarding the project and the dis- tribution of its modest economic benefits are made in community assembly, and work is organized through tequio, a responsibility to voluntarily participate in build- ing and maintaining communal infrastructure. Visitor movements and guidelines are coordinated with neigh- boring villages of Ixtlin and Ixtepeji, in order to ensure that no single niche or community gets overrun, and that certain sacred spaces, activities, rituals, and knowledge re- main protected from the tourists' gaze. The point of the Yavesia example is that nature-centered tourism is increas- ingly viewed as one of several strategies for community survival, cultural regeneration, and the communication of indigenous narratives about their own cultural ecologies. Unlike Plotkin's representation of indigenous concerns for cultural survival or the ecotourism industry's uncritical promotion of "sustainable development," territorial and political claims for self-determination are often at the fore- front of how indigenous peoples represent nature, its con- servation, and its visual appreciation. CONCLUSION The Shaman's Apprentice, like many other environmental films and the conservation programs they portray, has popular appeal because it offers a carefully crafted win-win vision of conservation and sustainable development, in which local participation and cultural survival are joined with the farsighted work of visionary scientist-activists. As conservationist propaganda, however, it raises more ques- tions than it answers. For whom is the rain forest actually being saved? That is, how do appeals to universal human ideals obscure the narrow interests that benefit, and what kinds of problems does this create for the people who ac- tually live there? Given the high stakes for national and international bureaucracies competing to legitimate their authority over landscapes, who has access and who gov- erns access to the rain forest? In such circumstances we have more to gain by scruti- nizing the vehicles of representation, including the real- isms they project and the dilemmas they omit, than by taking their messages and images as disinterested indica- tions of "how nature works" and how to resolve its prob- lems. Aside from their artistic and commercial impulses, environmental films are earnest political documents, through which filmmakers and their subjects communi- cate concerns about nature, and even more so, about is- sues not strictly about nature. These films express the emergence of the social orders and practices deemed nec- essary to ensure nature's survival. They also serve to vali- date and perpetuate conservation institutions and initia- tives themselves. Looking at them in this way does not imply that nature as reality is irrelevant but recognizes how thoroughly conflicting goals and practices of visual representation mediate knowledge and the moral certain- ties of environmental problems as well as the social or- ganization of their solutions.

Consider, for example, Teddy Roosevelt's commitment to both landscape conservation and his participation in the film Roosevelt in Africa (1910), which documented a hunting trip to Africa. Ac- cording to Mitman (1999:13), the masculine endeavor of hunting</page><page sequence="9">Visual Anthropology 1203 was at the time considered a "therapeutic balm" for the debilitat- ing effects of urban living and was supported by conservation ef- forts that would encourage people to spend time in the great out- doors. 2. In light of the popularity of so-called reality television and the rise of wildlife blooper films on channels like the Discovery Chan- nel and Animal Planet, it is apparent that viewers are quite inter- ested in "behind-the-scenes" scenarios (even if they are highly ed- ited). 3. Because nature films rarely show the "everyday life" of an actual animal whose habitat is actually being destroyed, these images pro- vide dramatic emphasis in a zero-sum allegory in which human economies expand at the expense of natural populations. 4. The classic film Environment under Fire (Dworkin et al. 1988) of- fers a typical narrative strategy by using a variety of talking-head experts (politicians, scientists, and activists) to explain the nature and scope of environmental degradation in Central America. 5. The image of fire is an especially common one in environ- mental discourse to suggest the urgency of degradation. Famous examples include The Burning Season (Revkin 1990), which is about Amazonian rubber tapper and union organizer Chico Mendes, who became an icon of 1980s grassroots environmental activism, or Shoumatoff's The World Is Burning (1990), which is also about Amazonian deforestation. 6. Alternatives focus mainly on restoring community-level re- source management authority and practices. One of the widely cited examples comes from Zimbabwe itself. The CAMPFIRE (Com- munal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) pro- gram sought to generate support for wildlife conservation by set- ting up resource cooperatives in which communities manage wildlife populations and benefit directly from tourism or hunting licenses. CAMPFIRE has come under critical scrutiny because of conflicts between state bureaucracies, communities, and private initiatives (Derman 1995), and it has more or less disappeared with the political upheavals in Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, it has been widely referenced as an African alternative to the ejection of native peoples from the landscape (Adams and McShane 1992). 7. FernGully: The Last Rainforest (Kroyer 1992) is a popular ani- mated film that presents a story of timeless forest innocents faced with aggressive bulldozers and destruction. 8. Both of these themes are explored in O'Connor's film Amazon Journal (1995). The film, which is an extended critique of the green primitive ideals he has encountered in the Amazonian region and in international sustainable development conferences like Rio 1992, shows the access Kayap6 gained in the international media (with the support of celebrities like Sting), as well media condem- nation of a Kayap6 leader when it was "discovered" that his life- style and pursuit of Western goods conflicted with "who Indians should be." The film also considers the marginalization of Kayap6 within Brazilian politics, precisely because of their identification with international interests that conflict with nationalist and state intentions in the Amazon. 9. This is the most basic ideology of "sustainable development" as elaborated in the UN's Agenda 21, which boils down to the follow- ing: If human beings living in areas of rich biological diversity can- not live economically viable lives, they will inevitably destroy the resource base that keeps wildlife alive and kill the animals themselves.
