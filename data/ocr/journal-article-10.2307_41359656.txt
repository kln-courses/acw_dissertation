<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animal Behaviour. By J. A. Loeser. pp. x + 178. Forty-one text illustrations by Erna Pinner. Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1940. Price 10s. bd. net. This interesting and provocative little book is an adaptation of a more formal publication issued in 1931 under the title Die psychologische Autonomie des organischen Handelns , in which the author attacked the current views on instinct, maintaining that the concept was unnecessary and misleading. Dr. Loeser, though he fought for his country in the war of 1914-18, was forced to leave his post in the University of Berlin and seek refuge in England in 1938, where a constant struggle against ill-health ended in his premature death in September, 1939. The English version of his book, left in an incomplete state, has been skilfully prepared for publication by Mr. L. J. F. Brimble ; it is illustrated by some vigorous drawings by Miss Erna Pinner. Dr. Loeser attacks in particular the mechanistic view of instinctive behaviour, that animals are automata so geared as to respond in an adequate or apparently purposive way to the external stimuli to which they are exposed. To this he opposes the psychological view of the animal as an active individual, doing its best in any given situation, within the limits of its psychological and physiological constitution. "It will be our endeavour, " he writes, " to investigate the animal world and to study animals as creatures which feel and act as individuals. We shall see that all theories of mysterious mechanism, by which animals are set in motion like machines, will disappear. Both animals and human beings will be seen to act according to one and the same fundamental principle - a psychological stimulus leads to a search for the means and activates the will to satisfy it " (p. 4). There is no rigid and necessary connection between stimulus and response such as is assumed in the strict theory of behaviourism. This point of view is in our opinion perfectly sound ; instinctive behaviour is psychological and not mechanistic. Dr. Loeser goes on to maintain that instinctive behaviour is made up of a series of free acts of will, carried out according to the " pleasure principle," and here we think he much under-estimates the psychological predetermination, specialisation, and stereotypy of instinctive behaviour, which give it its biological purposiveness, in normal circumstances. He admits of course the fact of the biological adaptedness of instinct, but relegates this in the main to the physical constitution of the animal. Speaking of the highly specialised behaviour of the ant-lion, he remarks " Once again a high measure of effective functioning has been attained by means of tiny psychological actions within the framework of an admirable biological preformation " (p. 61). More explicitly the same view is expressed in the following extract from his Conclusions (Chap. XIV) : " Each</page><page sequence="2">Oct. 4, 1940 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 889 ' instinct,' such as bird migration, the honeycomb-building of the social Hymenoptera or their complicated system of caring for their young, can be divided up into a number of ' small ' voluntary actions. These ' small actions,' combined with a specific physical constitution, which becomes effective in the animal's natural surroundings, unite to produce one biologically purposive action " (p. 174). This view, which does not seem to us a very satisfactory one, is illustrated in the body of the book by a large number of examples, interpreted in a somewhat anthropomorphic way. Here in our opinion lies the weakness of the book ; the author was an accomplished psychologist, but he lacked sufficient direct and personal acquaintance with biological facts. This makes him a rather unsafe guide in matters of biology and the behaviour of the lower animals, and many of his sweeping statements, unsupported by detailed evidence or references, must be regarded with reserve. He has gone much too far in assimilating animal to human behaviour, and he has closed his eyes to the clear fact that instinctive impulses, perceptions and actions are themselves specialised and pre-adapted to the normal life-conditions of the species.
