<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR AND AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE HABUR REGION. SECOND CAMPAIGN, 1936 By M. E. L. MALLOWAN Part i Introduction. The Archaeological Expedition to the Habur region of N. Syria, under the auspices of the British Museum and of the British School of Archaeo- logy in Iraq, undertook a second campaign in the spring of 1936. The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Cambridge, again provided generous grants, and we are indebted to the authorities of all the institutions concerned for their continued help and encouragement. The civil and military authorities in Syria gave us a cordial welcome on our return, and Monsieur H. Seyrig, the Director of Antiquities for Syria, gave his friendly co-operation in granting us all possible facilities for the continuance of our work. General Jacquot, in Der-ez-Zor, took a friendly interest in our activities, and we are much indebted to the practical help and kindness shown by his officers in Hasaka and Kamichlie. I am deeply indebted to the members of my staff for their skilful assistance and enthusiasm : thanks to them the season was as enjoyable as it was success- ful, and in every branch of the work I owe them more than I can say. Colonel A. H. Burn, C.I.E., O.B.E., shared all the archaeological work with me, and being a trained archaeologist and fluent in the Arabic tongue he was an invaluable colleague, and we are deeply grateful to him for having consented to join us as a volunteer worker. Mr. L. Osman was architect to the Expedi- tion: all the drawings illustrating this report, together with the plans and sections, were made by him, and are the best testimonial to his skill. Finally I have to thank my wife, who was again largely responsible for the mending of the pottery and for the photography undertaken in the field, having now shared with me the labours of three consecutive expeditions between Tigris and Euphrates. We employed on an average about 150 workmen, mostly Arabs and Kurds with a sprinkling of Yezidis. That this spirited and mettlesome gang worked together in a state of comparative peace was largely due to the assiduous labours of our two foremen from Jerablus?eAbd es Salaam and Ahmad ibn Hamoudi, the latter a young son of Hamoudi, bred in the best archaeological traditions. Scope of the Expedition. The purpose of the Expedition was to obtain as much information as pos- sible on ancient remains in the Habur in the period that elapsed between the beginning of the third and the middle of the second millennium b.c., and H</page><page sequence="2">92 M. E. L. MALLOWAN especially to concentrate on the remains of the latter period. The excavations were therefore chiefly confined to a broad flat ridge on the summit of Chagar Bazar, marked B.D. (cf. the contour survey shown on Fig. 2). This area contained private houses and a public building ; there were also graves under the floors containing a rich collection of votive offerings, which gave us a wide archaeological horizon for the period between 2000 and 1600 b.c. At the north end of this area we dug down through a succession of five main levels, carrying us back to the end of the Jamdat Nasr and beginning of the early dynastic epoch or to about 3000 B.c. We were thus enabled to obtain a larger view of the succession of civilizations which took possession of the Habur after the close of the prehistoric phase?a phase which came to an end with the extinction of T. Halaf pottery. Soundings at Arbit and Germayir. The general survey of the Habur, begun in 1934, was extended by a rapid examination of two mounds, Arbit, once a large and important city lying half- way between Chagar Bazar and Hamidi, 15 kilometres east of Chagar (see contour survey, Figs. 3, 4), and Germayir, a much smaller mound, once an agricultural settlement, 4 kilometres to the west of Chagar Bazar. Both these mounds yielded important material, and, more important still, proved that the succession of periods demonstrated from the main excavations at Chagar Bazar was characteristic of the whole of the eastern region of the Habur and not an isolated phenomenon. Both mounds revealed a considerable prehistoric occupation, evidence of a great prosperity between 3000 and about 1600 B.c., a break in traditions in about 2000 B.c., and a considerable decline in civilization and depopulation of the country after 1600 B.c.?a picture corresponding in all its important features with that provided by the excavations at Chagar. Chagar Bazar: Geographical and Climatic Considerations; Trade. The map shown on Fig. 1, emphasizing the great mountain barriers of Iran, Armenia, Taurus, and Lebanon, draws attention to the position of Chagar Bazar, which lies at the upper end of the fertile crescent, in a rich agricultural steppe constantly liable to invasion and exploitation by the hardy inhabitants of the surrounding mountain zones. Lying midway between Tigris and Euphrates, at approximately the same latitude as Nineveh, T. Halaf, Car- chemish, and Alexandretta, it was off the main stream of river-borne traffic passing up and down Mesopotamia, and owed its special importance to its position on an overland route connecting the two rivers with an extension to the Mediterranean coast on the west and to the Zagros and Elburz mountains of Iran on the east. A third point of contact was provided by trade routes to the north running into Anatolia, and evidence of all these different spheres of influence may be discerned from the objects illustrating this report. But the predominant centre of influence was always to the east, with the basin of the upper Tigris. Pottery, the staple commodity of everyday life in western Asia, ubiquitous and indestructible, tells the story in no uncertain fashion, and we</page><page sequence="3">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 93 find at most periods the strongest links between the ceramic fabrics of Chagar Bazar and those of Nineveh. Ultimately the Habur reflects the conditions prevailing in the core of Assyria. Climate: agriculture and metallurgy. Although in the summer months the Habur steppe is reduced to a condition of extreme dryness, and there is an intense heat which paralyses human activity, conditions during the winter and spring are as a rule very favourable to cultivation. The season of 1936 showed these variations of climate in.a characteristic manner. An abundant rainfall in the winter turned the steppe into a carpet of green grass and wild flowers. There were heavy rains in March, moderate rains in April, and even as late as the third week in May there was a day of exceptionally heavy rain?the latter a rare occurrence. The unfailing sunshine, normally tempered by favourable rains, ensures rich crops of wheat and barley, and though from time to time there are years of serious drought, the failure of the harvest is a comparatively rare occurrence. That similar conditions prevailed in antiquity is proved by the remarkable number of agricultural settlements which are now indicated by the sites of the ancient talk. Indeed, when we consider the richness of the soil, the normal sufficiency of rain, and the potentiality of the country to admit of irrigation, it seems surprising that the region was ever depopulated. But, as we have already pointed out, the Habur has always been exposed to invasion, and when catastrophe overtook the powerful centres on the Tigris, with which it was continually in touch, it lacked the cohesion to safeguard its interests. Agriculture cannot be pursued with profit when a country is infested with bandits and ravaged for fodder by powers contending in war. Proof of the agricultural activities in the region was provided by the dis- covery of enormous quantities of barley in the settlement of Germayir, west of Chagar Bazar?a site which, incidentally, is still given to the growing of barley, and is ruled by one of the wealthiest sheikhs in the region. Secondly, the discovery at Chagar Bazar of grain accounts,1 written in the Babylonian cuneiform script, proves that farming was an important source of revenue. Another source of wealth on the Habur was the manufacture of metal objects?more especially of weapons. The cities of the Habur were in close touch with the metalliferous regions of Anatolia, which must have been the source of supply for the copper, bronze, silver, and lead, which after 3000 B.c. appears on the Habur in increasing quantities. That the peoples of the Habur were capable of manufacturing metal objects for themselves is proved by the discovery of metal moulds for the casting of weapons (cf. Plate xviii b), and likewise of moulds for the casting of plaques and jewellery (cf. Plate xvn a, b). The abundance of weapons discovered in graves of the second millennium B.c. is evidence of a lively metal trade, and this ability to produce armaments first in the best Sumerian manner, and later following the prevalent fashions of Syria and Assyria, was undoubtedly, together with agriculture, a source of prosperity, providing at the same time a commodity for trade and the means of defence and self-reliance.

Iraq, vol. in, pt. i, pp. 8-n, and the schematic section of the mound shown on Fig. 2, op, cit. The main levels of the mound were numbered 15 in all, stratum 1 representing the latest level of occupation, stratum 15 the earliest. Levels 6-15 in the lower half of the mound were entirely prehistoric, and consisted largely of chalcolithic remains of the T. Halaf period ; the upper half of the mound, levels 1-5, appeared to be separated from the lower half by a certain gap in time. Levels 2-4 fell between 3000 and 2000 B.c., level 1 between 2000 and 1500 B.c.1 Excavations of 1936: greater precision in the chronological scheme, subdivision of level 1 into four periods of occupation, break between levels 1 and 2. The extended excavations over the surface of the mound in the area B.D. (Figs. 2, 5) revealed a fact which had not been apparent from the more confined work of the first campaign, that level 1, a homogeneous period, contained four sub-periods of occupation corresponding to considerable modifications and changes in house plans and covering a rise in floors of about 3\ metres. The early limit of level 1 is now defined by the discovery of a number of cuneiform tablets, all of which occur consistently at the bottom of stratum 1, and these are assigned by Mr. Sidney Smith to the First Dynasty of Babylon, giving us a terminus a quo which may be about 2000 B.c.?up to the present no exact date is discernible on the tablets.2 Further dating evidence is indicated first by the discovery of two cylinder seals in the Syro-Hittite style (Plate xn, no. 1, and Plate xvn c, no. 3), secondly by a certain re- semblance between the metal weapons of the period and those found at Ras Shamra, thirdly by the discovery of a single sherd of the 'Hurrian' ware3 of Billa, Nineveh, and Atshana, and in general by the appearance of torsade and twist patterns characteristic of the art of Kirkuk cylinders and pottery in the middle of the second millennium B.c. All these links point towards the period of the Kirkuk cylinders and levels 3 and 4 at Billa giving us an approximate terminus ad quern of c. 1600 B.c. It therefore seems probable that the 3\ metres of occupation debris included in level 1 falls approximately between 1900 and 1600 b.c. This was evidently a period of peace and considerable prosperity throughout the Habur, and it bears the stamp of homogeneity, for there is hardly any change or development in the pottery. Level 2 is sharply distinguished from level 1 by stratification and by the general character of its remains. Here we have buildings largely destroyed by the general re-levelling of the site due to th? foundation of level 1 as well as to the digging of graves. The pottery of level 2 is entirely different from 1 It is important to call attention to the fact that the evidence forthcoming from the second campaign at Chagar Bazar suggests that the admittedly pro- visional dating proposed for levels ? and 2 at the end of the first campaign was too low. There is little doubt now that the bulk of the material discovered in level 1 is not much later than 1700 b.c. and much of it is contemporary with the First Dynasty of Babylon. Similarly much of the material in level 2 is not later than the Third Dynasty of Ur. Cf. also Appendix on p. 154. 2 Cf. C. J. Gadd, Tablets from Chagar Bazar, 1936* pp. 178-83. 3 Cf. Iraq, vol. m, pt. 1, Fig. 27, no. 20.</page><page sequence="5">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 95 that of level 1, being characterized by the presence of a monochrome bur- nished black and grey ware with rounded bases in contradistinction to the flat-based painted wares of level 1. Level 2, of which there are few building remains extant, is closely linked by the character of its pottery and wall construction with level 3, and these two levels therefore belong to a single homogeneous period. Fortunately the discovery of a clay jar sealing or bulla inscribed in the Sumerian script (cf. Plate xni b), and probably to be assigned to level 2-3, gives an important clue to the date and character of these two levels which are likely to take us back to some period between the twenty- ninth and twenty-fourth centuries B.c. Further proof of Sumerian influence is the discovery in level 2 of an impression rolled out from a cylinder seal shown on Fig. 14, no. 5, Sumerian in style, with possible Cappadocian affinities. Level 2 has also provided a shell cylinder seal shown on Plate xii, no. 4, in the heraldic Sumero-Akkadian style of the same period, and probably corresponding to level 3 we have a copper adze, Sumerian in style, from the mound of Arbit (cf. Plate xiv d) associated with Sumerian vase types. Levels 2-3, therefore, would seem to cover the period from 2900 to 2300 b.c. and to show many traces of Sumerian culture. Levels 4-5 are characterized by the presence of the incised and painted pottery of the Ninevite 5 period (cf. Fig. 25) and between them cover an epoch which runs from the end of the Jamdat Nasr period to the beginnings of the early dynastic phase of Sumer. The following table defines the sequence: Level 1. Four successive occupation levels, referred to in the text as early, early intermediate, intermed. and late level 1. Painted pottery, cylinder seals of Kirkuk type, cuneiform tablets. Date c. 1900-1600 B.c. Levels 2-3. Homogeneous periods. No painted pottery; black and grey burnished wares, seal impression with Sumerian inscription in 2, Sumero-Akkadian seal in 2, Sumerian metal work. Date c. 2900-2300 b.c. Levels 4-5. Homogeneous periods. Painted and incised pottery of Ninevite 5 type. Seal impressions and seals of the end of the Jamdat Nasr period and beginning of the early dynastic. Date c. 3200-2900 B.c. SUMMARY OF CLASSIFIED OBJECTS DISCOVERED AT CHAGAR BAZAR, GERMAYIR, AND ARBIT, AND GENERAL CONCLUSIONS BASED ON THEM i. Terra-cotta Figurines. (Cf. Figs. 9, 10; Fig. 11, nos. 8, 9.) Of the twenty-three models in human form shown on Fig. 9 th? majority are types familiar to prehistoric Assyria and the majority of them can be closely paralleled in the T. Halaf levels at Arpachiyah. The figures from the historic levels are of special interest because they are rare types. The grotesque figures of the Mother Goddess type from level 2, Fig. 9, nos. 20-2, cannot be exactly paralleled elsewhere, but the designs of no. 21, with its decoration of impressed circles, recalls the decoration on the flat figurines from Kul Tepe in Cappadocia of the same date; no. 23, probably from the same level, is a more normal Syrian type and can be paralleled by examples from the Louvre Museum, illustrated in Zervos, L'Art de la M?sopotamie, dated to the twenty-</page><page sequence="6">96 M. E. L. MALLOWAN fourth century b.c., and by other examples unpublished in the Museum at Aleppo.1 Most remarkable of all is the figure of a bearded old man from a grave in Germayir (cf. Fig. 9, no. 18), contemporary with period 2-3 at Chagar Bazar, perhaps to be dated mid-way between the two levels, c. 2500- 2600 b.c.; in technique and appearance this figure (once ithyphallic, and no doubt a magical figure intended to command fertility) bears a strange resemblance to a figurine discovered at Bailas, in Egypt, stated by Sir Flinders P?trie to be contemporary with the Twelfth Dynasty.2 The models of animals are all shown on Fig. 10. Most interesting is the frequent representation of the horse, often represented with its trappings, sometimes appliqu? (nos. 22-4), sometimes in paint (nos. 29, 32). Similar models have been found in Cappadocia. These figures, together with chariot wheels, are very common in the earliest phase of level 1, c. 1900 b.c.; cf. also the wheel with painted spokes, no. 31. The frequency with which these models occur suggests that the chariot and draught horse was a common feature of everyday life on the Habur in the upper half of the second millen- nium b.c. Such a picture well accords with the records of chariot warfare as practised by the military dynasty of the Mitanni rather later in the middle of the second millennium b.c. The painted figures of animals are also interesting because they are of the same fabric, and executed in the same technique, as the contemporary geo- metric painted pottery, known as Habur ware, so common in level 1 (cf. pp. 102-4). Among them the humped bull figures prominently; there is a bifrons ram and a vase of painted Habur ware decorated with the head of a cow, which stands vertically over the rim of the vessel (cf. Fig. 10, no. 27) ; no. 30, from the same level 1, is an unusually fine painted model of a bull. 2. Amulets, Stamp Seals, Cylinder Seals. (Cf. Fig. 14 and Plates xii, xvii c.) A few stamp seals and drop pendants survived from the prehistoric T. Halaf levels (Fig. 14, nos. 21-4), and, indeed, the type still survived in Assyria into the Uruk-Jamdat Nasr period. A very interesting alabaster cylinder seal with an arabesque design, shown on Fig. 14, no. 2, and Plate xn, no. 2, was found at Germayir, and corresponds to Chagar Bazar level 5. It is clearly in the style of Sumerian seal cylinders of the Jamdat Nasr period, and may be paralleled at Ur, Uruk, Kish, and Susa. Of the same period is a black clay seal impression with designs of cervoids with long cylindrical bodies, similar to Nin. 3 seals from Quyunjik. From levels 2-3 we have, at the earlier end,.a series of black clay bullae, of which one in perfect condition is shown on Plate xiiib. The designs are of banqueting scenes and musicians, executed in the manner of the Royal Cemetery of Ur seals of the early dynastic period, and the specimen shown here is probably just pre-Sargonid. At the late end of this period we have 1 Cf. also Berytus II, 1935, Souran et Tell Masin, pl. L, nos. 81, 112, by Du Mesnil du Buisson. 2 Cf. Catalogue, fig. 9, no. 18, p. 128 and foot- note ? on the same page for analogous figures from Ashur and Gawra.</page><page sequence="7">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 97 the remarkably interesting impression on a clay tablet shown on Fig. 14, no. 5. The scene represents a combat between gods, one of whom is being pulled by the beard and has in his left hand a decapitated head. It appears that details may be paralleled on Cappadocian seals, and the figures are in the Sumero-Akkadian style, c. twenty-fifth century b.c. Of about the same date is the shell cylinder seal on Plate xn, no. 4, with designs of crossed lions and cervoids rampant. In level 1 we have two very important haematite cylinder seals, one of which is not likely to be earlier than 1750 b.c., thus giving an important indication for the early intermediate phase of level 1. The two seals are shown on Plate xii, nos. 1,3. No. 1, a beautifully cut specimen, is clearly in the heraldic style of the 'Syro-Hittite* cylinders, with its winged horned dragons, warriors with short tunics, vulture with spread wings, scorpions, and the curious symbol that bears some similarity to a double axe. The second seal (no. 3) already foreshadows the art of the Assyrian bas-reliefs of the first millennium B.c., though the seal itself is evidently not much later than 1800 b.c., and belongs to the First Dynasty of Babylon. Important, as representing the late phase of level 1, is the cylinder shown on Plate xvn c, no. 3, c. 1600 b.c. The latest of all the seal cylinders is shown on Fig. 14, no. 1, a steatite seal showing a religious scene in the style of Assyrian cylinders of about 1000 B.c. This seal was not found in the excavations, but was purchased from a peasant, who said that he had picked it up on the mound of Arbit. Excavations con- ducted on that site failed to produce anything of so late a date, but the seal may well have come from that neighbourhood, and is evidence of some Assyrian occupation on the upper Habur. A series of small faience amulets from level 1 reflect the tone of a fashion which is normal in contemporary Kassite Babylonia. Plate xiv a shows a minute sheep, a magical Puzuzu or devil's head with the characteristic bunched top knot, and a couchant lion. Most important is the Egyptianizing scaraboid shown on Plate xvn c, no. 1, and on Fig. 14, no. 18, with the design of a double Uraeus. This faience scaraboid cannot be exactly paralleled else- where, but is clearly in the style of Semitic II or Hyksos scaraboids from Gefcer. In the same category we must note the cylinder seal with rough rectilinear designs (Plate xiv A, second row), interesting because it has a glazed surface, a technical device that does not appear to occur before the beginning of the second millennium b.c. 3. Metal and Moulds for casting Metal Objects. (a) Gold. (Cf. Plate xin a.) The five gold objects come, without exception, from level 1, and are a token of the prosperity of the Habur at that period. The most interesting piece is a pendant or medal with a repouss? centre and an engraved surround. This medal has an interesting parallel at Mari, several centuries later in date, cf. Catalogue, Fig. 12, no. 13, p. 133.</page><page sequence="8">98 M. E. L. MALLOWAN One of the two ear-rings has a spiral coil of wire ending in a loop for attach- ment to the loose end. The thin strip of ribbon (Plate xin A, bottom row) was a fillet or diadem worn on the forehead. These objects come from the early intermediate levels of period i, c. 1800-1700 b.c. (b) Silver. (Cf. Fig. 12, nos. 14, 28.) A pendant with a boss centre is the counterpart of an example in gold shown on Plate xin A, middle row, and the object with curled ends is a hair ornament. Both come from level 1. (c) Lead. Fragments of lead were discovered in levels 2-3, and there were pins with looped ends. The nearest and most obvious source for the obtaining of lead was Cappadocia, and these objects are proof of a contact with Anatolia in the third millennium b.c. (d) Iron. Two fragments of iron supply further proof that the Habur was a very early centre for the working of iron in the third millennium B.c. Both these specimens come from level 3, and cannot be later than 2500 B.c. It is, I think, almost certain that these two fragments, which have yet to be analysed, will prove to be of terrestrial origin, as was the fragment of a dagger-blade discovered in level 5 in the course of the first campaign (cf. Iraq, vol. in, pt. 1, p. 26). (e) Copper and Bronze. (Cf. Fig. 11, nos. 1, 2; Fig. 12, nos. 1-16, 33; Fig. 13 ; Plates xni-xvi.) The commonest objects are toggle-pins: the oldest specimens are shown on Fig. 12, nos. 1, 10. No. 10, from Arbit, corresponds to Chagar Bazar level 3, middle of the third millennium b.c.: it has a conical fluted head, and may be paralleled by early dynastic specimens found at Kish, and is a clear example of Sumerian metal-work. No. 1, from level 2, before 2000 B.c., is interesting as being an Anatolian type which can be paralleled both at Alishar and elsewhere in Anatolia. Another early specimen, not later than 2500 b.c., is no. 7 from Arbit, with a grooved top and a ball head. The pins of level 1 are of a very distinctive type, which never occurs before 2000 b.c. They have shanks which are usually square in section, flat disk- shaped tops, and the upper part of the shank is often bulbous, and is joined to the top of the pin and the widest portion of the shank by a thin neck. At the point of perforation the shank of the pin is often engraved with a simple rectilinear design (cf. Plate xvi b). This type of pin can be exactly matched by a specimen from Gawra 5 which, if correctly assigned to that stratum, is an early example of the type, and even more interesting, there are parallels from the Caucasus in the Bronze Age graves of the Lenkoran examined by De Morgan.1 Fig. 12, no. 9, an exceptional type from level 1 with a fluted head and a ribbed shank, is exactly similar to a specimen from a grave discovered by Gautier at Tell et Tin in Syria and illustrated in J. De Morgan, La Pr?histoire orientale, tome in, Fig. 233, p. 239, where the dagger and the lance from the same tomb can also be exactly matched by specimens from level 1 at Chagar Bazar. A similar type of pin is also illustrated on Fig. 237 of De Morgan, op. cit., no. 17, a specimen described as Aegeo-Mycenaean. 1 Cf. J. De Morgan, op. cit., Fig. 212, p. 213, Epingles, Bronze III, Veri, Lenkoran.</page><page sequence="9">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 99 The spears and daggers shown on Fig. 13 are all from level 1 with the exception of nos. 2 and 3, the latter from Arbit, Sumerian in type, not later than 2700 b.c. Of the daggers from level 1 the most interesting is Fig. 13, no. 6, with its folded guards at the top of the blade, near the hilt. This type should be compared with the specimen discovered at Ras Shamra by Professor Schaeffer and described as having rudimentary horns (La Septi?me Campagne de fouilles ? Ras Shamra, 1936, Figs. 19, 20), dated c. the eighteenth to sixteenth century b.c., and thus corresponding very well with the Chagar Bazar stratum 1. The dagger-blade, no. 4, is also not unlike the type shown from Ras Shamra, Fig. 19 d, op. cit., but the analogy for so elementary a form of weapon is less striking. The interesting specimen shown on Fig. 13, no. 5, with a blade reinforced by a thickened centre, can be paralleled by specimens discovered by De Morgan in the Caucasus (op. cit., Fig. 197), assigned to Bronze Age 1 of the Talyche, and there is a precisely similar specimen from the grave at Tell et Tin in Syria above mentioned. The links with Ras Shamra are further strengthened by the types of spears from level 1, with reinforced ribbed blades and long, hollow socketed tangs (cf., again, Ras Shamra, op. cit., Fig. 19). An important object from Arbit, corresponding to level 3 of Chagar Bazar, is the socketed copper adze, cast, and shown on Fig. 12, no. 11, and on Plate xiv D. This is a decisively Sumerian example of metal-work, and once more shows the Sumerian connexions in the third millennium b.c. There are close parallels at Ur and on all the more important Sumerian sites. But, of all the metal objects, the magnificent copper or bronze ( ?) axe from level 1 is outstanding. Plate xv A shows the actual condition of the axe and xv ? the restored drawing. The scroll pattern running round the band at the top and sides of the socket is characteristic of the decoration of Kirkuk cylinders and 'Human' pottery of the middle of the second millennium b.c. For the present there is no known parallel for this splendid ceremonial weapon, which is obviously a development of a much older Sumerian type. Its approximate date is 1700-1800 b.c. From G 141, level 1, we have the remarkable copper ladle shown on Fig. 11, nos. 1,2. The purpose of this object is uncertain; it may possibly have been used by a jeweller or smith for pouring out molten metal, but it is more likely to have been a wine ladle. (/) Wine strainers. (Cf. Plate xiv c.) These objects consist of strips of sheet copper folded over to form a cornet-shaped receptacle. Their lower halves were perforated, and most of the specimens still contained within them the traces of a reed. These objects were invariably found at the bottom of large flat-based vases in graves of level 1, e.g. Fig. 21, no. 10, for the type of vessel containing them. Their purpose is clear. They were part of a wine-drinker's outfit, and intended to prevent the lees of alcohol from passing into the reed siphon through which the liquid was imbibed. The practice of drinking wine through a tube is illustrated on a funerary stele from T. al Amarna depicting</page><page sequence="10">??? M. E. L. MALLOWAN a Syrian warrior drinking wine through a siphon.1 Similar objects have been found at Deve Huyuk in north Syria, and at Tepe Giyan2 in Iran, also at T. el Yahudiyeh in Palestine, and they appear to illustrate a method of imbibing wine which probably passed into Egypt and Palestine by way of Iran and Syria.3 All the examples from Chagar Bazar are from level i, 1900-1600 B.C. (g) Miniature bronze model of a lion. (Cf. Plate xiv B.) This remarkable little piece was not discovered on the excavations, but was purchased from a peasant, who reported that he had found it on a mound called T. Qusaib, three kilometres north-west of Germayir. Opinions are divided as to whether it is Assyrian or Sassanian ; if Assyrian it may be a foundation deposit from beneath the threshold of a doorway; but the style of the head is perhaps un-Assyrian, and it appears that there are possible parallels of the Sassanian period; but so far I have been unable to trace them. (h) Metal moulds. (Cf. Plates xvn a, xviii b.) That the inhabitants of Chagar Bazar could cast their own metal implements is proved by the discovery on the site, and elsewhere in the Habur, of a number of stone moulds for the casting of weapons and decorative plaques. Plate xviii ? shows a fine example of an open sandstone mould for the casting of copper or bronze implements. The mould was found in level 2, and two of the mould forms are for well- known Sumerian weapon types?a chisel and a dagger (cf. Fig. 13, nos. 1, 2 respectively). In addition the same block contains a mould for a peculiar type of tool not met with elsewhere, and there are moulds for three simple blade forms, doubtless intended to be worked up with a hammer subse- quently. Several parallels exist for this type of open mould; De Morgan, op. cit., tome in, Fig. 184, shows a mould described as a Tolissoir de Khalli Dehlil' (Kurdistan de Moukri), probably of the early Caucasian Bronze Age, with precisely the same blade forms as those on the Chagar Bazar example ; there are two fine specimens in sandstone for the casting of copper objects from the sixth stratum at Tepe Gawra (Speiser, Excava- tions at Tepe Gawra, pl. xlvii), and there are other examples from Til- Barsib (T. Ahmar on the Euphrates, below Carchemish), albeit probably later in date. Plate xvn a, ? shows a remarkable serpentine ( ?) mould, probably intended for the casting of lead plaques ; it is a mould with a representation of a triad of divinities and between them a Syrianizing version of the Egyptian 'ankh' sign ; the type of plaque which the mould was intended to turn out finds parallels in Anatolia, both in Cappadocia and even as far west as Troy. On the same plate there are moulds for miniature gold work, including a cylinder doubtless fitted together in two pieces?the latter objects were purchased, their provenance being the Habur region, but the serpentine mould with the triad of divinities is from level 1 of Chagar Bazar. 1 Cf.

Fig. 12, nos. 17-27, 29, and Plate xvi A.) Of the selection of bone pins the most interesting are shown on Plate xvi A. The examples with ribbed tops are obviously copies of metal types. The finest specimen is surmounted by a beautifully carved miniature bear ; it was discovered in level 4 and is of the early dynastic period, not later than 2900 B.c. A rare specimen shown on the same plate is surmounted by a phallic head, and was discovered in a grave at Germayir corresponding to levels 2-3 of Chagar Bazar, not later than 2500 B.c. 5. Beads. (Cf. Plate xviii A.) Most of these strings were found in graves and are restrung in their original order. Nos. 1, 2, 5 are all from level 1 and contain the materials most com- monly used at that period?agate, quartz, and carnelian. No. 3 is from Germayir, and contains quartz and carnelian ring beads and painted shells ; it corresponds to level 2-3 of Chagar Bazar. No. 6 from level 4 of Chagar Bazar is composed of carnelian, faience and shell beads. No. 4, the most interesting necklace, comes from a grave at Arbit corresponding to level 3 of Chagar Bazar, and the fluted spherical ball beads are characteristic of the Royal Cemetery at Ur : the material is a black stone. The centre piece of this neck- lace is a most unusual bead, being composed of jus cement and inset with roughly cut pieces of quartz. 6. Flint, Obsidian, Stone. (Cf. Fig. 11, nos. 3-7, 10; Fig. 12, nos. 30-32.) The type of obsidian knife or scraper commonly found in all chalcolithic sites of western Asia was in use at Chagar Bazar as late as level 3, but after this becomes rare with the increasing exploitation of metal (cf. Fig. 12, nos. 30, 31). One or two specimens of small scrapers in a translucent quartz were also found. An unusually large specimen of a flint knife from Arbit?one of a set?is shown in Fig. 11, no. 5. Stone celts (cf. Fig. 12, no. 32) are also common, but, as with the flint and obsidian, become rare in the historic levels. Fig. 11, nos. 3, 6, show large specimens of stone duck weights from levels 2, 5 respectively, and no. 10, a trough-shaped painter's palette in white lime- stone from Arbit, corresponding to level 4 at Chagar Bazar ; the kidney-shaped type is rare. The most interesting stone object is a white marble crescent, perforated transversely, Fig. 11, no. 4, intermed. level i,c. 1700-1800 b.c. We may con- jecture that it was once affixed to a pole and was part of some ceremonial equipment equivalent to the crescents borne on poles associated with Kassite monuments depicting altars. This piece has an additional interest, because it is the exact counterpart of a Hittite matrix from Boghaz Koi (cf. Bogazkoy, K. Bittel and H. G. G?terbock, Berlin, 1935, pp. 32, 33, and illustration on Taf. 21, no. 12 c, and for general references to this type of object D. Opitz, Altorientalische Gussformen (M. v.

Fig. io, no. 27; Fig. 16, nos. 8, 13-15; Figs. 21-24; Plate xix, nos. 1-3.) One of the most noticeable features of the Habur survey was the extraordinary quantity of sherds with elementary geometric designs lying about the slopes of the ancient mounds. The excavations at Chagar Bazar have enabled us to assign this pottery to its proper context?the upper half of the second millennium b.c., for this ware is exclusively found in level 1, having as its approximate limits 1900-1600 b.c. This pottery consists largely of vases intended to carry liquids, and the usual shape is a wide mouth, a high neck, and a flat base, as on Fig. 21. Another characteristic specimen is that shown on Fig. 22, no. 14, where the body is more globular, the neck shorter?a type of vase in which the wine strainers described on p. 99 above are commonly found. These two, the largest forms of vessel, attain a maximum height of 30 cm. Smaller and more delicate types of vases are shown on Figs. 23, 24; apart from the vase type the commonest and most distinctive type is the bowl, Fig. 22, no. 2 and Fig. 23, no. 1. The potting shows a considerable variation from a very coarse buff ware to a well-refined pinkish or creamy clay with a carefully prepared surface, and all the pots were wheel-made. The design is executed in a matt red or reddish- brown or a black paint, and is in one colour only ; a certain variation of shade often occurs on the same vessel, but this is due to uneven firing and applica- tion of the paint ; there was never an intentional polychromy. The designs are singularly monotonous, and consist of the very simplest geometric elements, usually applied to the upper portion of the vase only, but sometimes continued down to the bottom ; occasionally there are markings on the rim. The vase is sometimes strengthened by ribbing at the shoulder, as on Fig. 22, nos. 11, 14. As to the patterns: plain bands, triangles hatched or cross-hatched, sometimes with the addition of a dot pattern, plain hatching or cross hatching, zigzags, and V's practically exhaust the whole repertoire. Design is, in fact, almost exclusively rectilinear; the rough markings on Fig. 22, no. 12, is the only curvilinear pattern out of a series of some hundreds of vases. With this uninspired geometric repertoire the potter was apparently content for some hundreds of years, and indeed the complete uniformity of the ware over so long a period is a very interesting phenomenon. There appears to be no change in the vase forms, no evolution in the design; if any change may be detected it is perhaps in the more carefully made smaller vessels which appear to come in towards the end of the period (Fig. 24, nos. 1, 2, 11), which have very delicate walls and smoothed surfaces. At the begin- ning of the period the potting is on the whole coarser. This change to a more delicate fabric was probably due to the introduction on to the Habur of the Hurrian ware, with more elaborate designs, which began to find favour early in the sixteenth century B.c. and induced the local potters to produce a more carefully finished product.</page><page sequence="13">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 103 There is one solitary plant or tree design, very simply executed (Fig. 21, no. 8), and an animal decoration in relief has already been commented on in our summary of the terra-cotta objects (cf. Fig. 10, no. 27). The remarkable profusion in which this ware is distributed all over the upper Habur and especially in the region bounded by a line drawn from T. Halaf to Nisibin on the north and by the rivers Habur and Jaghjagha on the west and east respectively, and converging at Hasaka, suggests that this country is the true home of that fabric ; whether or not the ware actually originated on the Habur is a debatable matter. Now that we have so great a quantity of the fabric before us, and in view of its distinctive character, it will be convenient to give it a name, and I pro- pose to call it Habur ware, this being the region which has, up to date, produced more than 90 per cent, of the known specimens. The term is no more than a convenient label, and does not imply that the ware was invented on the Habur: indeed, we have expressly to exclude any associations with the lower Habur, for south of Hasaka I have never observed a single specimen, and even if it does exist below that latitude it must be rare in that region. For the present the only other country, that has any claims to compete with the Habur as a province in which the fabric is at all commonly found is the upper Tigris,1 more especially round Nineveh. There are examples from Nineveh itself, from Billa, from Gawra, and it is probable that mounds on the river Husur may contain examples of the fabric. The more delicate types appear also as far south as Ashur. But none of these sites has produced the fabric in anything like the same abundance as the Habur. If we go farther to the west we find examples of the ware on the upper Euphrates, at sites round Carchemish, such as Hammam, Kara Hassan and Amarna, possibly also at T. Ahmar. Farther west still we find this fabric penetrating the plain of the ?Amq ; a few analogous specimens were shown to me by Sir Leonard Woolley at Atshana,2 and another centre of distribu- tion is the Orontes valley on the sites of Dnebi and T. As ; a very late variety of the ware is also found at Hama, where it has been shown to me by Professor Ingholt; and here it appears after 1500 B.c. and runs well into the end of the second millennium. In western Syria then, especially in the 'Amq, the ware is comparatively rare and often late in its contexts; in eastern Assyria it is more common, and begins fairly early. There are two obvious sources that we may look to other than the Habur as possible points of origin. First there is Cappadocia, where there was already, in the twenty-third century b.c., a painted pottery at a time when there were no painted wares on the Habur. But the Cappadocian types are dissimilar and the form of decoration really very different. The second ? It is important to note that one good example of the painted rjabur ware, very similar in type to the painted examples shown on fig. 21, has been found at Nuzi, east of Tigris, apparently in the ?urrian city. Cf. R. F. S. Starr, Nuzi, vol. 2, pi. 70 b. The Nuzi specimen is presumably ap- proximately contemporary with the late phase of Chagar Bazar level 1. 2 The Illustrated London News, Oct. 9, 1937, p. 605, fig. 4.</page><page sequence="14">I04 M. E. L. MALLOWAN and more obvious source of origin is western Iran?in particular sites on the Zagros such as Tepe Giyan. Here we have an unbroken tradition of painted pottery which persist from chalcolithic times till late in the second millen- nium b.c. In Giyan 2 there are several painted vases very closely related to Chagar Bazar types. The stratum is dated 1800-1400 b.c. and therefore contemporary with level 1 at Chagar Bazar. But at Giyan the designs are more varied, richer, and better applied as indeed we should expect on a site which lies in one of the cradles of painted pottery. Farther back still we have in Giyan 3, 1800-2500 b.c., certain types such as large vases with flat bases and ribbed shoulders which, I think, may well be the ancestors of the Habur vases, and the vase types of Giyan 3 are in turn derived from proto- types in Giyan 4, which carry us back to the beginning of the third millen- nium B.C. I conclude, therefore, that Habur ware, which suddenly arrives on the Habur in about 2000 b.c. and entirely displaces the older unpainted and burnished fabrics, is a variety of an Iranian highland ware, the prototypes of which are to be seen in the Zagros. This fabric found a home on the upper Tigris, but in the more powerful cities of that region it had to compete with well-established industries, and the painting of pottery had fallen out of fashion, largely owing to the abundance of metal vessels. In the more pro- vincial region of the Habur, on the other hand, this ware found a home less critical and less well catered for by metal-workers. Here, then, the ware found a congenial home and enjoyed a run of at least 400 years, during which time it hardly changed its aspect at all; and when in the end the local potters were obliged to compete with other markets and produce a finer fabric, this region suffered a death-blow from the competing powers round it, and Habur ware disappeared altogether. (b) Ninevite 5 Ware. (Cf. Fig. 25.) Two very characteristic specimens of this pottery were discovered in a single grave (Fig. 25, nos. 1, 3). The dis- covery is interesting because in the first campaign, although many examples of the contemporary incised ware were discovered, there were no characteristic painted specimens. These two examples, on the other hand, betray the slick dexterity of design that is so characteristic a feature of the ware. No. 1 has a bright purple paint, another technical device of the period. No. 3 is a good example with an interesting design ; the festoon pattern on the belly of the vase would appear to be a representation of a corded holder for sus- pending the vase. Nos. 6, 7 are much cruder fabrics and hand-made, in contradistinction to nos. 1, 3 which are made on the fast wheel. I think that nos. 6, 7, 9 are local products, the work of unskilled provincial craftsmen catering for a demand in painted pottery. In Iraq, vol. in, pt. 1, p. 39, I suggested that this fabric might be the work of potters descended from artisans of prehistoric times. The affectation of a hand-made product at a time when almost all pottery was made on the fast wheel appears as a definite throw-back to a more ancient traditional type. It is probable that nos. 1, 3 are actual imports from the Tigris, perhaps from Nineveh itself.</page><page sequence="15">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 105 8. Incised Ware, Lugged Vases, Vases with Animal Designs in relief, Burnished Pottery, Unpainted Pottery. (a) Incised Ware. (Cf. Fig. 25, nos. 4, 5, 8.) Nos. 4, 5, from Arbit, are typical examples of the Ninevite 5 period, c. 3000 B.c.: no. 4 may perhaps be an imitation of rushwork and no. 5, a typical empanelled specimen, is probably a basketry type. No. 8, from Germayir, with its punctuated decora- tion is an unusual type and belongs to the period succeeding that in which 4 and 5 were found, date c. 2500 b.c. It appears that on the Habur the practice of incising pottery is characteristic of the third millennium b.c. After 2000 B.c. the nearest approach to incisions as a form of decoration on pottery is the ribbing on vases of level 1, e.g. Fig. 20, nos. 23, 24. (6) Lugged Vases. (Cf. Fig. 19, nos. 11, 14.) The addition of lugs to vases again appears to be an early characteristic. Fig. 19, no. 11, with its cylindrical barrel handles, is to be assigned to the upper half of the third millennium b.c., and the lugs are probably an imitation of the metal-work of the early dynastic period as represented in the Royal Cemetery of Ur. No. 14, with its semi-circular lugs, is in the style of the large urns of the Ninevite 3-4 period and is probably intermediate between T. Halaf and the Jamdat Nasr period. (c) Vases with Animal Designs in relief. (Cf. Fig. 20, nos. 1, 2.) The earlier specimen is no. 2, an interesting fragment of a large-bellied vase from Germayir ; the top of the vase is encircled by the model of a snake in relief. The vase dates from about the twenty-fourth century b.c. or possibly a little later. There are parallels at Gawra, where the frequent representation of the snake in various materials emphasizes its ritual significance. The Gawra examples are, however, almost without exception earlier than the Germayir specimen ; but there are other parallels from Ashur more closely contempo- rary, and a celebrated example on an offering table from Baisan belongs to the upper half of the second millennium b.c. The vase shown on Fig. 20, no. 1, is one of the latest specimens from Chagar Bazar; it was found imme- diately below the surface and is to be associated with a series of stone pave- ments representing the last occupation of the site. It is, I think, one of the rare objects to be assigned to some date in the later half of the second millen- nium b.c., probably after 1500 b.c. (d) Burnished Pottery. (Cf. Fig. 19, nos. 6, 9, 13, and the photographs on Plate xix, nos. 4, 5.) The fashion for burnishing pottery is especially pre- dominant in levels 2 and 3 throughout the middle of the third millennium B.c. The examples on Fig. 19 and Pl. xix are all wheel made and have rounded bases finished off by hand. The fabric is a black ware with a well-smoothed surface, sometimes shading to grey sometimes to a yellow or pinkish shade, apparently the result of a reducing chemical action. The forms and technique of baking are not found after 2000 B.c., and the closest parallels are, I believe, to be found in the Elburz mountains of north Iran, in particular in sites such as Shah Tepe, where the firing and shapes are similar to the examples</page><page sequence="16">??6 M. E. L. MALLOWAN from the Habur and there is an approximate contemporaneity. The Iranian examples shown me by Dr. Arne in Stockholm were closely similar to the Chagar Bazar specimens, but the former were made by hand. I do not think that we need suppose that this pottery was actually exported from one region to the other ; the correspondence is probably no more than the result of a community of fashion, and the type of fabric is one that would appeal to inhabitants of a steppe, wherein leather forms must have been common. Another region in which monochrome burnished ware is at home is Cappa- docia (and, indeed, Anatolia in general) ; but the Habur forms are much closer to the Iranian. (e) Unpainted Pottery. (Cf. Figs. 15-20, Fig. 25, no. 2.) The unpainted forms illustrate the changes in fashion that occur in successive periods at Chagar Bazar. Levels 4, 5, which belong to a homogeneous period, show consistent forms. The champagne vase shown on Fig. 25, no. 2, belongs to this period and is characteristic of a type which is common in Ninevite 5 ; in other parts of Syria it occurs in modified forms down to the end of the third millennium B.c.; there are variations of the type from Carchemish and T. Ahmar on the Euphrates. An interesting and rare type of the early period, probably contemporary with the pottery of Jamdat Nasr and the beginnings of Ninevite 5, is the 'spectacle' vase shown on Fig. 19, no. 5. This type of vessel, which may perhaps have been a flower vase, has a very long history, probably because it was used in religious ritual. It first appears with Al- 4Ubaid pottery at Arpachiyah; it occurs at Gawra in stratum 8b at the turn of the Uruk-Jamdat Nasr period, and its latest manifestation is in graves of the Larsa period at Ur, c. 2000 B.c., where the two mouths have become very much smaller and the body less globular. The most characteristic forms of levels 4 and 5 are deep bowls with rounded bases (Fig. 18, nos. 13, 16), and there is a tendency as time goes on for the base to become more pointed (Fig. 18, nos. 8, 11, from level 3). This type bears a certain similarity to the handled cups from Cappadocia, but the examples from the Habur are always without handles. In levels 2, 3 there is a predilection for the use of vases with rounded bases, whereas in level 1 bases are nearly always flat. Noticeable also are the vases with long necks from levels 2, 3, e.g. Fig. 20, nos. 8, 9. Other types characteristic of levels 2-3 are the miniatures, always well finished, shown on Fig. 17, nos. 1-3, 9, and the bottle with a very small orifice, Fig. 17, no. 16, especially common at Germayir, corresponding to levels 2-3 at Chagar Bazar. Finally we may mention the important vase types (Fig. 17, nos. 17, 20) with short necks, beaded rims, and squat bodies. These vases are important because they occur commonly in the Royal Cemetery at Ur and in the fifth and sixth stratum at Gawra ; this is one of the very rare types that is found both in Sumer and in Assyria in the third millennium B.c. The spouted vase (Fig. 16, nos. 7, 10, 12) does not occur in level 1; all these examples were made before 2000 b.c.</page><page sequence="17">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 107 In level 1 the unpainted pottery follows the forms of the painted ware very closely. Far the commonest forms are large vases intended to hold liquids, necks are long or short, bases always flat, e.g. Fig. 20, nos. 21-4. Peculiar and characteristic types are Fig. 19, no. 3, a form which seems to have found its way into the 'Amq plain, the carinated bowl, Fig. 16, no. 5, and a rare type of bottle, Fig. 15, no. 13, from an early phase of level 1. 9. Architecture. (Cf. Figs. 5-8.) A detailed description of the buildings occurs in Part 2, and here it is only necessary to summarize those features which imply a connexion with con- temporary buildings in other regions. In the early period, level 5, the building with a buttressed fa?ade and a white lime plaster face is perhaps related to the temple architecture of Gawra 8. Remains of the three succeeding periods are hardly sufficient to warrant comparisons. In level 1 the formless agglomera- tions of houses leave no distinctive ground plans, but they are probably more nearly akin to house building in Assyria than to the well-defined ground plans of contemporary houses in Babylonia. A noticeable feature is the use of the arch and of the barrel vault; it is indeed probable that the majority of the rooms in the houses at Chagar Bazar were vaulted, and that flat roofs were more rare. The arch is also common in tombs; for the barrel and the corbel vault are regular features of funerary architecture. At the north end of the mound the temple-palace of level 1 seems partly analogous to buildings at T. Halaf, and here we appear to have a characteristic form of Syrian archi- tecture of the second millennium B.c. In general, therefore, we may say that in level 1 public buildings appear to have analogies to the west in Syria and private buildings to be related to house plans of eastern Assyria. 10. Graves. The normal type of burial at all periods is a simple pit inhumation dug to a depth of between 1 and 2 metres. In level 1 there were also burials in corbel-vaulted or domed graves of mud brick, and this type of burial may be paralleled by the grave vaults of the early second millennium B.c. in Babylonia. As in contemporary Babylonia also, in level 1 the body was interred beneath the floor of the house, and the grave was in alinement with the house wall. This no doubt was also the regular practice at the period on Tigris sites in Assyria, but the published evidence for Assyrian house burials of the period is still comparatively rare. Foreign Refations. Now that we have made a summary review of the most important archaeo- logical material from Chagar Bazar it may be of interest to recapitulate in tabular form the various sites and regions outside the Habur with which Chagar Bazar may be connected.</page><page sequence="18">??8 M.

Part 2 buildings, stratification, soundings at germayir and arbit, catalogue of graves Chagar Bazar: Sites excavated in 1936. (Cf. Contour Survey, Fig. 2.) The first object of the second campaign was to obtain as much information as possible about the latest period of occupation at Chagar Bazar. The scene of the main excavations was the site B.D., occupying a broad flat ridge on the summit of the mound, and the buildings unearthed covered a maximum length of 70 m. and a maximum breadth of 30 m. The plan resulting from this work is shown on Fig. 5, and the section through the same site on Fig. 6 shows the general stratification covering a depth of about 6 m., including four main levels of occupation belonging to a homogeneous period composing level 1. At the north end of the site B.D. excavations were continued under- neath level 1 into the four preceding levels 2, 3, 4, 5. Level 2 had been badly destroyed by the rebuilding of the city which took place after 2000 b.c. with the foundation of level 1 ; l?vels 3,4,5 contained the remains of large public buildings with heavy mud-brick walls representing respectively the occupations of the middle third millennium, the early dynastic, and Jamdat Nasr periods. Excavations were also conducted on a smaller scale on two other sites A.B. and A.C., and the resulting plans are shown on Fig. 7; such buildings as survived on these two sites belonged to levels 1 and 4-5 respec- tively. Finally a test pit was made at the lowest contour level on the extreme north end of the mound through about 2 m. of debris down to virgin soil; there were no buildings here at all, and this piece of negative evidence is of value because it emphasizes what is also clear from other soundings?that down to 1600 B.c. the main occupation of the city was confined to the tall itself, but outside it, on the level of the plain, there were no habitations to speak of. It is in fact more than likely that all the land in the immediate</page><page sequence="19">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 109 vicinity of the tall was given over to agriculture with the exception of the roadways leading into the city. Configuration of the Mound, Entrances to the City. (Cf. Figs. 2, 5, and Iraq, vol. in, pt. 1, pp. 5,6.) At the base the mound measures approximately 400x300 m. The long axis of the mound lies NW.xSE., and it is interesting to find that the main axis of the buildings follows the same direction, for denudation which ulti- mately determines the present aspect of an ancient mound follows along the alinement of ancient walls. The two principal entrances to the city likewise correspond to the lines of easiest ascent on the east and west sides of the mound respectively. Thus the eastern entrance follows along the valley indicated by the widely separated contour lines between the sites A.B. and A.C., and the western entrance follows along a rather steeper valley to the west of the B.D. site, terminating in a wide maidan or open place between rooms 23 and 26 in B.D. One of the main drains of the city was also carried out through this entrance. The top end of the thoroughfare on the east side of the city was marked by the presence of a small fort excavated in 1937 to be described in a subsequent report. There may also have been a third entrance on the west side of the mound, to the north-west of the modern house marked on the 16-m. contour; the existence of this third entrance is only a deduction from the contours, as no excavations have been conducted in this area. Site B.D. Scene of the Main Excavations. (Cf. Plan, Fig. 5, section Fig. 6.) The site may conveniently be divided into two halves: the northern half consists of the rooms numbered 1-24, carefully laid out, with exceptionally thick main walls, certainly a public building, perhaps a Temple-Palace ; the southern half consists of the rooms numbered 26-48, which are the compo- nent parts of private houses. Site B.D. The Private Houses. (Cf. Plan, Fig. 5 ; Rooms 26-48.) The houses of level 1 belong to four main phases of occupation which may be referred to as early, early intermediate, intermediate, and late respectively. The plan before us belongs to the middle or intermediate phases of these occupations, for very little is left of the earliest phase, which was largely destroyed by the intermediate, and the buildings of the last occupation were very flimsy, with walls often no more than two brick courses thick, lacking the strength to survive for any length of time. It is clear, however, that the buildings of the intermediate phase usually follow fairly closely along the lines of the first foundation, which still survives in the long wall that is, as it were, the backbone of the central ridge. This long wall runs NW. by SE. and is flanked on the west by rooms 26, 31, 33, 38, 40, &amp;c, and on the east by rooms 27, 30, 34, 43, &amp;c. This main boundary wall, which has an average thickness of 1 m., therefore divided the house site into two halves, and the</page><page sequence="20">no M. E. L. MALLOWAN houses were built back to back, generally without access to one another, against this wall. No doubt the wall line corresponded to a long-standing boundary between different landowners, for even between rooms 30 and 31, where a breach in the wall was at one time made for purposes of communica- tion, it was afterwards blocked up again. The walls were entirely built of mud brick, usually faced with mud plaster, and the floors, which were of beaten mud, often had pavements consisting of rough limestone blocks, as in rooms 31, 45, 46; there were also occasional traces of cement flooring. It is probable that originally a very large proportion of the floors were stone paved and that the comparative rarity of such pave- ments is due to subsequent plundering. The commonest size of mud brick was 37 X 17 X9 cm., with variations of a centimetre more or less, and other usual sizes are 38 ? 34 X 8 J cm. and 38 X 30 X 8| cm. : a thick mud mortar was used, and the wall faces were usually covered with mud plaster. There was, however, a noticeable absence of mud plaster in room 30, where the SW. wall was faced with a single course of mud bricks 38 cm. square set on edge and showing their full superficies, thus giving the appearance, of a decorative panelling. The quality both of building and of brickwork was poor in the houses, the walls were often badly alined, the bonding of the brickwork was inadequate, and only rarely was there any attempt to obtain a through bond by the alter- nate use of headers and stretchers; this weakness, however, was occasionally counteracted by using a layer of pebbles in the thickness of a wall in order to obtain more cohesion. The heavy denudation on the sides of the mound is largely responsible for the disappointing incompleteness of the house plans, which consist only of a nucleus of rooms. We may, however, discern at least four different houses, which we may group as follows : (a) Rooms 30, 34, 35, 36. This house consists of a nucleus of rooms grouped about a large courtyard, room 30 with internal dimensions of 7 X 10 m. It will be observed, however, that the plan is unlike that of contemporary Babylonian houses, for the courtyard is not in the centre of the house, but at the north end. This courtyard contained the decorative brick-panelled wall referred to above. Under the floor of this court there were no less than seven graves, and this is another characteristic of the houses?the selection of the largest room in the house for the family vaults. This house bore traces of all three phases of construction: the SW. wall foundations went very deep and could be traced back to an earlier foundation ; during the intermediate phase, to which this house belongs, there were at least three periods of reconstruction in the course of which the level of the floor rose over half a metre, an entrance was forced into room 31 and ultimately reblocked, and the courtyard was partitioned by a flimsy wall on the SE. side. Finally in the latest phase a thin wall was built over the top of the ruined SW. wall occupy- ing only half its breadth, the floor level being correspondingly raised by nearly a metre.</page><page sequence="21">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR in The narrow passage less than ? m. in width giving access from the court to room 34 is a characteristic feature of house building of the period?a severe economy of space in the construction of passage-ways. (b) Rooms 26,2?, 31. This house resembles (a) in the spaciousness of its ground plan, and room 31 was altered at least three times in the intermediate phase. The chief feature of interest is the narrow trough drain with a cement bed set in the thickness of the NW. wall ; this drain evidently passed out through the main gate of the city on the west side of the mound. The SW. side of the house is unfortunately non-existent owing to denudation, but it seems almost certain that there must have been in this direction some road- way giving access to houses (b), (c), and (d) running parallel with the main internal wall against which the houses are set and debouching on the maidan 24, thus connecting all the houses with the temple area. It should be observed that the NW. wall was backed on to the older SE. boundary wall of 24, and the drain was actually built into the interval of half a metre left between the two walls. (c) Rooms 32, 33,3?, 38. This house is of meaner proportions than houses (a) and (b), but the flimsy wall separating room 32 from room 33 belongs to the late phase of occupation. (d) Rooms 3?, 40, 41, 42. This house is especially interesting because of the discovery in room 42 of a fallen barrel vault and of a fallen arch with the bricks lying radially on the floor of the narrow passage on the SE. side of room 41. In room 42 the fallen vault lay astride the chamber; the springers rested on the NE. and SW. walls, and no doubt the brick rings were leaned against the unusually heavy SE. wall, which was over 1-2 m. thick ; the weight was thus distributed between three walls, an architectural device common in Babylonia in the Larsa period, and we have, therefore, a long barrel vault spanning a room 3*5 m. wide. It is important to observe, however, that the vault in question belongs to an early intermediate phase and that at the time of its construction there was no doorway at the end of the SW. wall of room 42?access was probably in the middle of the wall?and the small partition wall separating rooms 40 and 42 were also non-existent when the vault was in use. The narrow vaulted passage-way on the SE. side of room 41 is again a characteristic feature of the architecture of the period. An important dis- covery was made in room 42, the fine haematite cylinder seal shown on Plate 1, no. 1, which was contemporary with the vault; this discovery makes it pro- bable that the vault was in existence somewhere between 1800 and 1700 B.c. and that the house plan shown subsequent to the vault falls a little after the latter date. Subsequent to this again we have flimsy walling at a higher level, which may be as late as 1600 B.c., whereas the first foundation of all, i.e. that prior to the vault, carries us back nearer to 1900 b.c. (e) Rooms 43, 44, 45. This fragmentary house plan again bears traces of several periods of occupation. The SW. wall of room 43 goes back to an original foundation in the First Dynasty of Babylon, whereas the limestone paving in room 45 standing at a high level actually runs over the top of the</page><page sequence="22">112 M. E. L. MALLOWAN party wall between the two rooms and probably takes us down to a date after 1600 B.c. The narrow passage between rooms 43 and 44 is again characteristic and contains a terra-cotta drain-pipe under the floor. Site B.D. The Public Building. (Cf. Plan, Fig. 5, Rooms 1-23.) The large building in the northern half of the site is obviously very different in character from the house quarter just described. Unlike the buildings in the house area it is a unity in itself, consistent in character, and with a well- thought-out plan. The architectural details, brick sizes, floors, wall plaster are generally similar to those we have already observed in the houses, but the quality of construction, alinement, and solidarity of walls and composition of the bricks is altogether superior to that of the houses. The plan of the building consists of two distinct complexes, different in character, but interdependent. The western half of the building is obviously residential in character; it consists of rooms 1-11, and rooms 19, 20 were probably subservient to them, whereas the eastern half of the building is obviously non-residential, and seems partly analogous in plan to the * temple- palace ' building of Kapara at T. Halaf; this part of the building contains rooms 12-18 and 21-3. The building gives on to an open maidan with a maximum breadth of 6 m., gradually narrowing as it runs out to the gate on the west side of the city. The entrance to the building is on the SE. side, and is approached by a flight of steps which originally had limestone treads and were flanked by two rooms, 22, 23, on the NE. side. The entrance was situated in the long wall flanking room 17 and thus produced a 'broad-room' effect for this portion of the building. The original rise in ground level from the maidan must have been about a metre, and the top of the stairs probably passed into a towered door- way set in the thickness of the great SE. wall of room 17, which here projects to a thickness of no less than 2*2 m. The oblong ante-chamber 17 was flanked on the NE. by room 18 and on the SW. by rooms 19, 20, and on its NW. side the thickest wall in the whole building, measuring no less than 2-7 m. in width, finally gave access to three small rooms, 13,14, 15. It is possible, I think, that room 15, to which this series of heavily defended chambers seems ultimately to lead, may have been the sanctuary or Holy of Holies. The narrow passage- way between rooms 11 and 13 may possibly have given access to the roof. Chambers 12,16,18 were probably magazines for storing the temple treasure. Rooms 1-11 appear to be a residential quarter, and rooms 4-8, more especially, seem to be part of a symmetrical house plan. Rooms 19, 20 have a special character of their own, and it is possible that room 20 was a chapel dedicated to the memory of some one venerable in the city's annals. This speculative suggestion may be accepted for what it is worth, but the fact is that the substructure of the entire room was occupied by a well-built funerary vault with a domical roof (cf. Fig. 8, no. 2, G 137) and over the top there had been a carefully laid limestone floor. Further, the tomb had subsequently</page><page sequence="23">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 113 been robbed and rifled of its contents ; as it is outstanding in size and con- struction, and inferior graves contained rich offerings, we may presume that it once contained rich treasure. As may be seen from the plan and from the catalogue of graves, the entire 'temple' site was rich in burials lying at various depths beneath the floor and belonging to various stages of the early and intermediate phases in level 1. It will be noticed, however, that on the temple site the room 15, which has been presumed to be the sanctuary, and the two rooms leading off it had no burials. It is possible, therefore, if we are right in interpreting our evidence, that we have a comparatively late example of a very ancient practice whereby it was desirable to be buried as close as possible to a sanctuary without being actually interred inside it ; I refer to an analogous practice in the chalcolithic period of T. Halaf at Arpachiyah. It is indeed difficult, with so little analogous evidence before us, to be sure of the character of this building, and I will not presume to say that my interpretation is a right one. Perhaps then it may be well to summarize the evidence, such as it is, on which the conclusion is based. (1) This particular portion of the site had for at least a thousand years been occupied by public buildings ; cf. Fig. 7, where the plans of the buildings of levels 3, 4, 5 must alike by their lay-out and spaciousness be public build- ings; the construction in level 5 was almost certainly a temple. (2) Excellence of construction, good brickwork, and unusual thickness of walls distinguish it from the house site farther to the SE. (3) The graves in this area were exceptionally rich, and the considerable number of vaults shows that many persons of wealth and distinction were buried here. (4) The discovery of a stone mould shown on Plate xvn A, middle row, intended to cast lead plaques depicting a trinity of gods, may well be a sacred relic, giving a clue to the character of the site. (5) The discovery of two cuneiform tablets with lists of names recording the receipt of grain is exactly the type of record that we might expect to find in a building of this character. The 'Temple Palace' would supervise the collection of the city's revenue. (b) The partial similarity in plan with the 'Kapara Temple Palace' is suggestive. Admittedly the T. Halaf building is much later in time, but it may well be based on an ancient plan long familiar to the Habur (cf. von Oppenheim, Der Tell Halaf, 74). This cumulative evidence therefore leads me to think that the building may have been something in the nature of a temple palace, that its SE. end was probably religious in character, and that the NW. half was the residence of officials connected with the building. Stratification and Sequence Dating of the B.D. Site. The plan of the building as shown on Fig. 5 is contemporary with the main plan of the house site, that is to say, the 'Temple-Palace' belongs to</page><page sequence="24">114 ?? ?? L? MALLOWAN the intermediate phase of level i. The builders who founded the Temple Palace seem to have made a clean sweep of the preceding building beneath it, so that very little is left of the early phase of level i. Referring to the section in Fig. 6, we may see at the NW. end of the building a series of stone pavements which indicate the progressive rise in the buildings of level ?. Of these pavements, the topmost at ?3 m. represents the last traces of occupation on the site and may take us down to some period after 1600 B.c. The lowest pavement of all in this area goes down to a depth of 6-5 m., but this level belongs to the early phase of the palace foundation and we no longer possess the ground plan at this depth. But this lowest pavement, at ?6-5 m., is important because at this level were found two cuneiform tablets, which are thought to have been written at the time of the First Dynasty of Babylon. Now between this and the topmost pavement of all, that is to say between ?3 m. and ?6-5 m., we have a series of three stone pavements falling approximately between ?4*5 m. and ?6 m. These three pavements between the 4-5- and the 6-m. mark therefore constitute the intermediate and late levels and correspond to certain modifications of the temple plan. In particu- lar we may mention the most notable changes towards the end of the inter- mediate phase?a widening or revetting of some of the main walls by Kisus, and it is to the last phase of the intermediate period that the NW. wall of room 17 owes its extra thickness. The section through B.D. also shows the corresponding rises in pavement levels of the house area at the SE. end of B.D., and here in our description of the various houses we noticed certain details of construction corresponding to the progressive phases of level 1. As is to be expected, the depth of the levels in the house area does not exactly correspond to that in the temple area, but the progressive rise in levels corresponds to a homogeneous series of phases, and here the early phase of occupation, i.e. corresponding to the First Dynasty of Babylon, seems indicated by two pavements at a depth of ?7-5 m. and ?8 m. respectively; the intermediate phases fall between ?5 m. and ?6 m. and the late phase between ?3 m. and ?4 m. To sum up, therefore, both for the temple and the house area we have the following sequence in level 1 : (a) The early phase, probably corresponding to the First Dynasty of Babylon: floor levels rise by 1 m. in the houses. (b) The intermediate and late phases represented by the existing ground plans: three levels, early intermediate, intermediate, and late, rising by 1*5 m. in the temple and by 1 m. in the houses: probable date 1900-1600 b.c. (c) The latest phase: no plans, hardly anything survives, flimsy walling rise of 1 m. in floors: probable date, after 1600 b.c. Site A.B. (Cf. Fig. 7, no. 3, and Contour Survey, Fig. 2.) The buildings in this area were in a poor state of preservation, and it was not possible to recover an intelligible ground plan. All that was left was a heavy terrace holding up the mud-brick buildings on the SE. side of the</page><page sequence="25">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 115 mound. The stratification is important because in the ash debris of the build- ings lying on the terrace we discovered seven cuneiform tablets, of which two were in perfect condition, the remainder damaged. The tablets apparently belong to the First Dynasty of Babylon and the mud-brick buildings resting on the terrace are therefore of the same period and are contemporary with the buildings of the earliest phase of level 1 on the B.D. site.1 Four graves, 167, 169, 173, 175 on the A.B. site rested on or above stone pavements which marked the floor of the buildings containing the tablets. It follows, therefore, that the graves belong to some period subsequent to the tablets, and further that they correspond to the early intermediate phase of level 1 on B.D. and probably fall between c. 1900 and 1600 B.c. Site B.D. Excavations in the Deeper Levels 2, 3, 4, 5. (Cf. Fig. 7, nos. 1, 2.) Of level 2 hardly anything remains, and it is probable that its buildings were largely swept away in the rebuilding of the city which took place at the beginning of the second millennium with the foundation of level 1. On the B.D. 'Temple-Palace' site the discovery of two graves 164 and 166 lying at a depth of ?9-5 m. and containing within them burnished black ware pottery similar to specimens from Germayir suggested that a beaten mud floor, from which the graves were dug, lying at a depth of ?8-5 m., corresponded to the general level of 2. In general this level is likely to fall at some period be- tween 2500 and 2000 b.c., possibly nearer the earlier date, as is suggested by the discovery of a complete seal impression with a scene representing a combat between gods (cf. Fig. 14, no. 5) in the Sumero-Akkadian style and of bulla fragments at a depth of ?8 m., and further, of a white shell cylinder seal in the same style at about the same depth.2 In this level there was a very large size of mud brick measuring 50 X35 x8? cm. The buildings of levels 3,4, 5 were too fragmentary to produce a consistent architectural plan, but the formidable thickness of the mud-brick walling going up to a maximum of 2*5 m. in level 5, and the size and lay-out of the rooms, makes it certain that we have here a series of public buildings. Intrusive into level 2 we have the vaulted tomb G 141, which had been cut down from level 1, and grave 154 had been dug to an even greater depth, penetrating into level 3. Levels 4 and 5 were distinguished by the construc- tion of buttressed walls (cf. Fig. 7, no. 2, rooms 59, 60). In level 5, room 60, the mud-brick wall had a whitewashed buttressed fa?ade, an unusual feature. It was difficult to distinguish exact brick measurements in levels 4, 5, but the bricks appeared on the whole to be rather smaller than those used in 3, from which the following brick sizes were obtained; commonest sizes: 52x26x8 cm. and 54x27x8 cm., rarer 45x26x9 cm., 48x24x8 cm. Thick mud mortar was generally used throughout, and in these levels a better bond was obtained by the alternate use of headers and stretchers, but the bricks were often carelessly laid. 1 Cf. C. J. Gadd, Tablets from Chagar B^zar, 1936, pp. 178 ff. Cf. pl. xii, no. 4.</page><page sequence="26">??6 M. E. L. MALLOWAN As regards the sequence dating, level 2 probably falls between 2500 and 2000 B.c., as we have already pointed out; level 3 seems likely to go back to the early dynastic period, c. 2900 b.c.; and levels 4-5, which contained the incised ware of Ninevite 5, take us back from the early dynastic to Jamdat Nasr times. It is also noteworthy that in level 5 there were fragments of seal impressions with designs of crudely drawn cervoids characteristic of Nineveh 4 and Gawra 8. Site A.C. (Cf. Fig. 7, no. 4.) The mud-brick walls that remained on this site?on the lower slopes of the SE. end of the mound (cf. Fig. 2)?were interesting because they were the remains of a private house area corresponding to level 4-5. No coherent ground plan remained ; rooms tended to be long and narrow, and narrow alley- ways separated one house from another. Four graves of this early period were found here and two of them, G 177, 178, lay directly under the beaten mud floor of a private house, and at the SE. end G 188, with its typical Ninevite 5 painted pottery, also seemed originally to have been connected with a house floor. In the same area and intrusive into it there were a number of later graves corresponding probably to the intermediate phase of level 1. Tall Germayir. (Cf. Fig. 3.) Continuing the survey of the Habur, soundings were made at this mound which lies 4 kilometres to the west of Chagar Bazar. The core of the site consists of a compact conical mound rising to a height of over 20 m. above the level of the plain. Germayir proved to have been an agricultural settlement, which must have come into existence in the chalco- lithic period and was finally abandoned before 2000 B.c. The soundings were of special interest because they produced from the top of the mound a rich series of graves buried under the floors of houses corresponding approxi- mately to levels 2-3 at Chagar Bazar. There were no specimens at all of the painted Habur ware of level 1, and a great proportion of the pottery consisted of a black burnished ware, which included a curious type of bottle (cf. PI. xix, no. 5) not found at Chagar Bazar. The deeper graves probably went back to level 3 of Chagar Bazar, and lower yet again a fine alabaster cylinder seal of the Jamdat Nasr period (cf. PI. ?? i, no. 2) showed the presence of predynastic remains. In pit C we discovered a very large quantity of grains of carbonized barley corresponding in date to-level 2-3 of Chagar Bazar, and a remarkable terra-cotta figurine representing an ithyphallic man, in technique resembling a figure from Ashur stratum G, may also be connected with the agriculture activities at Germayir (cf. Fig. 9, no. 18); the figure was probably intended to secure fertility of crops and of cattle, and no doubt it was also a magical figure connected with the reproduction and increase of children. It is interesting that Germayir is to-day inhabited by Kurds, and is still a very rich barley-growing centre.</page><page sequence="27">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 117 Tall Arbit. (Cf. Fig. 4.) Arbit was the second of the two sites on which soundings were made. It is a much larger site than Germayir, which was probably a mere village. Arbit, on the other hand, must have been a town of considerable importance. The name Arbit means 'Serpent' and was no doubt given to the site because the centre of the mound overtops a series of undulating hummocks which lie coiled about the head in serpentine fashion. The top of the mound stands no less than 30 m. above the level of the plain, 15 kilometres from Chagar Bazar, and about half-way between Chagar and Hamidi. From the top of the mound one can see along the horizon no less than no mounds, all of which represent ancient occupations of the Habur and remind us of the great prosperity of the region in antiquity. Arbit has maximum dimensions of 440x440 m., and the core of the site is surrounded by a great mud-brick town wall no less than 45 m. thick, which defended the city. The wall served both as defence for the inner city and as a platform for houses; these enormously thick walls with houses set on top of them are, of course, typical of Babylonian sites. The Arbit wall was built in the early phase of level 1 of Chagar Bazar and the houses on it contained some good examples of the Habur geometric ware ; an unusually fine specimen from this site is shown on Fig. 21, no. 13. Arbit also produced two very rich graves (cf. Fig. 4, trench 5) containing burnished black ware akin to the pottery from Germayir and to levels 2-3 of Chagar Bazar; cf. TAG 18, 20 in the list of graves; the metal-work from the same graves was clearly Sumerian and included the copper adze shown on Plate xiv D, and the copper pin with the conical fluted head shown on Fig. 12, no. 10. The beads also were in the Sumerian fashion (cf. PI. xviii A, no. 4). The resemblance between this material and the earlier remains of the Royal Cemetery of Ur makes it probable that the contents of these two graves correspond to the early dynastic period of Sumer. Earlier still we have, from the deeper levels of Arbit, some good specimens of the incised and empanelled ware of Ninevite 5 period corresponding to Chagar Bazar 4-5, c. 3000-3200 b.c. (cf. Fig. 25, nos. 4, 5). In the mound of Arbit, therefore, we have represented considerable remains of all the main phases of occupation on the Upper Habur from the second millennium b.c. back to the Jamdat Nasr period, and there is no doubt that under these again lie the earlier chalcolithic remains of the T. Halaf period. A reference to all the more important objects found both at Germayir and Arbit may be seen in the list of graves referring to those sites on pp. 124-7. CATALOGUE OF GRAVES CONTAINING OBJECTS General. The majority of the graves are simple inhumations, the bodies being flexed and laid in a pit which as a rule was dug to a depth of about a metre or more below the level of the house floor. Infant burials were sometimes no more</page><page sequence="28">??8 M. E. L. MALLOWAN than half a metre deep. Much the deepest dug graves are the corbel vaults, which owing to their height required a greater depth of soil. The orientation of the grave nearly always corresponded with the line of the room walls above, and there was no fixed rule for the direction of the head. All the graves are marked on the site plans with the exception of those from Germayir and Arbit, which occur in a separate list. The orientation of the Chagar Bazar graves may therefore be discovered from the site plans. As regards the relative depths of the graves a mere reference to actual depth below a constant datum line is useless, because the relative building levels vary considerably from site to site. But the principles underlying the method of interpreting the successive levels have been explained in the preceding pages, and the section shown on Fig. 6 shows the relative stratification of certain of the graves on the B.D. site, which contained the greatest number of burials. From the superposition of pavements and changes in ground plans it has been found possible to group the graves of level ? into four phases, early, early-intermediate, intermediate, and late. Graves of the early and late periods are rare, the vast majority are intermediate, and of this group we have been able to classify certain graves as early intermediate and those immediately succeeding them as intermediate. Broadly speaking, then, we may for the present say that most of the material falls between about 1900 and 1600 B.c. and the bulk of the intermediate graves falls perhaps about half-way between those two dates. The importance of the grave catalogue is first that it enables us to say precisely what objects are exactly contemporary?this we may gather from their association in a single grave. Secondly we can group together certain graves which were found in the same room or in adjacent rooms of the same buildings and which are obviously contemporary. In the list, therefore, there are cross-references to contemporary graves in the same building. On the B.D. site the position of the grave is indicated by a reference to the number of the room in which it is situated, and this may be ascertained from Fig. 5. The position of the head in a grave is marked by the cross on the arrow delineating the position of the grave. CATALOGUE OF GRAVES CONTAINING OBJECTS N.B.

GRAVES AT GERMAYIR All graves from Germayir are preceded by the initials GG. For an account of the site cf. p. 116. The graves appear to correspond to Chagar Bazar level 2-3 and are to be dated before 2000 b.c. The resemblance of the terra-cotta figurine from GG 25 to a specimen from Ashur stratum G, c. 2600 B.c., is at present the chief clue to a date, but in a subsequent season 1937 during the third campaign at T. Brak burnished pottery of the Germayir type occurred in houses which appeared to belong to the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur. It seems, therefore, that if we suggest a time series of c. 2250-2500 B.c. for the majority of the Germayir graves, we may be fairly near the mark. The graves lay beneath the floors of private houses, but the mud-brick walls had been so poorly constructed and so thin that no house plans survived. For the position of the graves cf. the site plan, Fig. 3.

The graves appear to correspond to Chagar Bazar level 3 and are to be dated to before 2500 b.c. The contents of TAG 20 with its socketed copper adze, beads, and copper pin with conical fluted head can be closely matched by material from the Royal Cemetery of Ur of the early dynastic period, and even some of the pot types are early Sumerian forms familiar from Ur and from Gawra in Assyria. The most probable date for the early graves from Arbit (there are only two), TAG 18 and 20, would seem to be some period between the early dynastic and the Sargonid of Mesopotamia, viz. c. 2900-2500 b.c. It is for the present still not possible to attain greater precision than this because on the Habur throughout a large part of the third millennium B.c. both metal and pottery types show very little change, as we know from an examination of the contents of levels 2 and 3 at Chagar Bazar?the period to which the early graves from Arbit approxi- mately correspond. For the site plan cf. Fig. 4. The graves were found in trench 5. TAG 1. Body E.xW. Head W. At ? 2 m. Grave was cut down into the core of the town wall, as was TAG 5, which was contemporary. These two graves provide interesting evidence of some occupation of Arbit in the fourth century B.c., for in TAG 5 there was a silver coin of Alexander the Great of Maced?n and the pot types are well known in the fourth century B.c. in western Syria, e.g. at Antioch and elsewhere.

Male figure, known as 'The Old Man of Germayir* and previously illustrated on the front page of the Illustrated London News of 27 March 1937. The man is bearded and the grotesqueness of the head is enhanced by the large ears. The left arm is bent and the hand rests half-way down the body, which is hollow. The right arm is missing and was knocked off in antiquity. Originally the figure was ithyphallic, but the penis, which was probably in contact with the right hand, as we may judge from the markings on the body, was also knocked off in antiquity. The legs consist of two circular stumps and are interesting because they are modelled in the form of the legs of the tripod vases of Til-Barsib, Hammam, and Chagar Bazar. This presum- ably magical figure was no doubt associated with the act of sexual intercourse and may have been a symbol of fertility in child-bearing and in the reproduction of crops and of cattle. The discovery of this type of object in a grave of a member of a primitive agricultural community is not unnatural. The counterpart of this figure is a three- legged vase in the anthropomorphic style, probably representing a female, from Ashur stratum G (cf. Andrae, Die archaischen Ischtar-Tempel, p. 52, Abbildung 32), made before 2600 B.c. and probably a century or more earlier than the Germayir figure. Another even more remarkable parallel and further distant is an apparently ithyphallic figure with hollow body, from Bailas, ascribed by P?trie to the Twelfth Dynasty and discovered in a tomb (cf. P?trie and Quibbell, Naqada and Bailas, pis. xliv, xlv), presumably, therefore, somewhat later than the Germayir figure. It is interesting that some of the contents of the Ballas tomb were foreign work, pointing in the direction of the Tigris valley1 and Iran. The grave in which the Germayir figure was found contained 1 Another important parallel occurs in stratum 6 at Tepe Gawra, op. cit. pl. lxxvi, no. i, and p. 159, an anthropomorphic figure, shaped into a bowl with tripod base, again approximately con- temporary with the Germayir figure.</page><page sequence="39">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 129 burnished pottery and other types overlapping with Chagar Bazar stratum 2-3, and the connexions with both strata were noticeable.

In addition to the usual models of cattle among which the humped bull is prominent, we have frequent representations of the horse, often shown complete with harness and associated with chariot wheels. Models of wheels are very common: no. 31 shows an example with painted spokes, but, on the other hand, models of chariot cabs are extremely rare. I would suggest, therefore, that the chariots themselves are likely, as a rule, to have been made of wood and have disappeared owing to the perish- able nature of the material in which they were made. The horse with its trappings becomes common in the early phase of level 1, c. 1900 B.c., and no doubt the introduction of this animal into the Habur is to be connected with the prosperous condition of that country in the upper half of the second millennium B.c.

The ladle has a finely tapered end and this was no doubt intended to enable one to attain precision in the pouring out of some liquid : the purpose of the object may have been the pouring of molten metal into a mould, but alternatively, and this is perhaps the more probable explana- tion, it may have been used as a wine ladle, for in the same grave there was the unusually large wine jar shown on Fig. 21, no. 12, with a mouth wide enough to admit of the insertion of this spoon and there was also a copper wine strainer.

Copper, Silver, Electrum, Gold, Lead, Bone, Flint, Obsidian, Stone, Terra-cotta Objects. General. The copper objects, and more especially the pins, are of the greatest importance because their distinctive and peculiar types belong to well-defined periods and they may be closely related to material from Cappadocia and from the Caucasus, as well as to material from Syria, Assyria, and Mesopo- tamia. The metal objects from the Habur are satisfactorily stratified, and form important evidence for the distribution of specialized metal types in western Asia in the second and third millenia B.c. Preliminary spot tests suggest that</page><page sequence="42">?32 M. E. L. MALLOWAN the large majority of the objects are of copper, but some of them may on analysis turn out to be bronze; the pins and the axes were all cast. The drawings on Fig. 12 should be examined together with the photographs on Plate xvi b, which show the objects after cleaning and in particular reveal that many of the shanks of the pins were engraved. Of the pins no. 1 is the earliest, not later than 3000 b.c., a type which appears in Cappadocia; no. 10 is early dynastic, c. 2700-2900 B.c.; a Sumerian type, no. 7, on cleaning, proved to have a head with spiral ribbing and dates to about 2500 B.c.; nos. 2-6 are the standard types in use on the Habur between 1900 and 1600 b.c., and no. 9 a rare type, also of the same period, has been found at Tell et Tin in Syria. The socketed adze, no. 11, is an early Sumerian type. See also the commentary on pp. 98, 99. Of the remaining objects we may call attention to the beautifully carved bear surmounting the bone pin no. 22, an early dynastic piece, and the bone pin with a phallic head, no. 26, slightly later in date, c. 2500 B.c. (cf. PI. xvi a). The electrum pendant no. 13 appears more clearly, together with its tang, on Plate xin a: analogous examples from Mari are many centuries later in date. Fig. 12. Catalogue. No. 1. Copper pin, circular in section, upper end of shank splayed, flattened, and perforated. Early type, common in the third millennium B.c. The type has been found in levels 2, 3, 5, but never in level 1, and it is probable that it was extinct by 2300 B.c. There appear to be unpublished specimens from Anatolia,1 where it also occurs in the third millennium B.c. In Syria there are similar types from tomb IV at Qatna, which lies in the direction of the Orontes valley. Tomb IV at Qatna is dated by the excavator to c. 2500 B.c. (cf.

Even more interesting and perhaps more nearly contemporary are the specimens from the Caucasus discovered by J. De Morgan, La Pr?histoire orientale, tome in, fig. 212, described as Bronze III from Veri in the Lenkoran region of the western Caspian. The more elaborate forms from Veri may be later in time, but, on the other hand, we have also to allow for the fact that they are in a natural metal region where types may have been quickly elabo- rated : the incised markings on the shanks of the Veri pins may also be paralleled at Chagar, cf.

MALLOWAN Fig. 14. Cylinder Seals, Stamp Seals, Seal Impressions, Amulets. General. A large number of the objects shown here were purchased, and come from various sites in the region of the Habur, and they are briefly recorded as showing the variety of material to be found in this country. No. 2 is from Germayir, nos. 3, 5, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 21-3, 26, 29-32 are from Chagar Bazar. The object of outstanding interest is the remarkably fine cylinder seal in haematite, no. 3, from level 1, and this piece we have dated partly on stylistic evidence and partly on stratigraphie grounds to about 1750 B.c.; the seal is discussed at some length in the catalogue. No. 5, c. 2300-2500 B.c., is important for the dating of level 2, and nos. 12 and 18, the minute faience sheep and the Egyptianizing scaraboid also in faience, are important for their occurrence in level 1. Nos. 21-3 are prehistoric pendants with a tradition running back to the T. Halaf period, and for this class of object the work on Arpachiyah should be consulted. Fig. 14. Catalogue. No. 1. A 368. Cylinder seal, steatite, black. Ritual scene in which two men clad in cap, pig- tail, and long tunic stand on either side of an altar table with high legs. One of the figures holds a fan, the other bears an offering. A pot stands upon the altar and a second pot beneath it. Emblems: crescent moon and staff (?). This is an Assyrian seal executed in the shallow cutting in intaglio of about 1200-1000 b.c. It was said to have been found at Arbit and is therefore illustrated here, but in point of fact no other objects of that date were found in the mound and its provenience is doubtful. For a very similar seal cf. Sidney Smith, Early History of Assyria, pl. xxi, from Nimrud; cf. also Hayes Ward, The Seal Cylinders of Western Asia, figs. 723, 724, 729-31. Ht. 32 mm. Diam. 7 mm.

Cylinder seal, haematite, black, exceptionally fine cutting. Heraldic design consisting of a pair of winged griffins rampant with feathered plumes rising from their heads. Between the griffins a kneeling man clad in a short tight-fitting tunic going down to the knees. On either side of the man a dove, and above him a vulture with spread wings. Behind each griffin there is a man clad in a short flounced tunic going down to the knees ; above the shoulder of one of the men a conventionalized double axe(?), and on either side of the vulture a scorpion. Close parallels will be found for all the elements represented in this seal on the class of cylinders generally referred to as Syro-Hittite, cf. Hayes Ward, op. cit., figs. 828, 899, 903,912, 935, 938, 939, 944; cf. also G. Contenau, La Glyptique Syro-Hittite, nos. 139, 140, 174,183, 185. There is also a partly similar type of seal carved in the style of the seal impressions on the Kirkuk tablets, cf. Sidney Smith, Early History of Assyria, pl. xx, nos. b, c. It will be observed, however, that these seals, which have the same precise style of cutting, are smaller in size than the specimen from Chagar Bazar. One of the most interesting features of this seal is the tunic worn by the men. This type of dress is clearly not Babylonian and may well be the apparel worn by men of some ethnic element peculiar to the Habur and to Assyria?one is tempted to suggest the yurrians. It is important to observe that when these figures occur on other seals they play a subordinate role and are much smaller in stature than the gods represented with them. Dr. Contenau,</page><page sequence="47">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 137 op. cit., p. 109, has an interesting suggestion concerning these figures to whom he refers as 'Petits personnages* : 'Ces personnages ne seraient-ils pas de petits g?nies de la nature dompt?s par le dieu et r?duits au r?le de suivants comme les satyres du cort?ge de Dionysos?* The crested plume worn by the griffins became common in Mycenean times, and indeed this style of cylinder enjoyed a long vogue, cf. C. F. A. Schaeffer in the Illustrated London News, 16 Feb. 1935, fig. 9, showing a fine haematite cylinder from a house in the Mycenean town at Enkomi, Cyprus. For the type of vulture with spread wings cf. also Schaeffer, La Troisi?me Campagne de fouilles ? Ras Shamra, op. cit., pl. xi, no. 1, third seal from the top. Taking all these comparisons into consideration, I am tempted to place the Chagar Bazar seal about half-way between the finely cut cylinder seals of the First Dynasty of Babylon and the smaller Kirkuk cylinders. The style of cutting is clearly in the manner of the precise work of the First Dynasty, but the spacing of the figures is more cramped, yet certain of the features distinguishing the Kirkuk seals are missing. The approximate date, therefore, might be about 1750 b.c., as is also suggested by the stratification, for the seal belongs to the early intermediate stage of level 1, cf. p. m. Ht. 23 mm.

There are five figures, apparently deities, wearing high-horned conical hats, with the exception of one, a horned bull god wearing a cap.

The bull god holds a club in his right hand and he is addressed by a god who appears to be standing on mountains. In the centre a small indecipherable figure, perhaps a demon. Dimensions 4X3 cm.

In colour the unpainted pottery varies from a light yellowish drab to a greenish drab, and in general a description of the colouring conveys little and consequently has little scientific value.

No. 13, the large wine jar, can be closely paralleled at Hammam in the neighbourhood of Car- chemish and also at Billa. This type and no. 14 often have copper wine strainers found inside them. Note also another type characteristic of the period, the carinated pedestalled bowl shown on no. 8 with dashes of paint round the rim. This type seems to have been developed from a shallower unpainted saucer with carinated rim and flat base, which on the Habur may go back as far as 2000 b.c. and in Babylonia is in the Third Dynasty of Ur, c. 2250 B.c., one of the commonest pot types.

Nos. 3, 4, 10. Of these no. 3 is important because analogous types are found at Billa, Gawra, and in the 'Amq plain, a pot form which had a range extending from western Syria to Assyria. No. 10 is typical of the large unpainted wine jars with flat bases found in level 1. Level 2. Nos. 1,7, 8, 12, 13. The last three types are characteristic of this level and closely related to types occurring in level 3 ; burnished pottery with rounded bases is especially noteworthy in both these levels. Level 3. Nos. 2, 6, 9, 15. This includes the early dynastic pottery from Arbit; no. 9 is an exceptionally fine well-finished specimen of bur- nished black ware. Level 4. No. 11. Vases with barrel lugs are characteristic of the early dynastic period and are probably influenced by the barrel-lugged metal vases commonly found in contemporary Sumer. Prehistoric. Nos. 5, 14 are approximately contemporary; no. 5 belongs to the Ninevite 3 period of ceramic which overlaps with Al-4 Ubaid ware; it is a very ancient type of ritual vessel. No. 14 is probably a little later and belongs to the turn of Ninevite 3-4. The interest of these two vases is that they represent traces of an occupation, on the slopes of the mound, intervening between the T. Halaf level 6 and the Jamdat Nasr, early dynastic level 5. Elsewhere there was a gap in the occupation levels at this time, and it is certain that between T. Halaf prehistoric period and the period corresponding to Ninevite 5 there must have been a severe depopulation of the whole of the region of the Upper Habur, cf. Iraq, vol. p?, pt. 1, p. 8.</page><page sequence="53">THE EXCAVATIONS AT TALL CHAGAR BAZAR 143 Fig. 19. Catalogue. No. 1. A 303. Vase. Ht. 20 cm. Germayir. Level2(?). No. 2. A 302. Vase. Ht. 18 cm.

Note the two bottles with elongated necks, no. 9 from Germayir being approximately contemporary with no. 8 from Chagar Bazar level 2. Nos. 17 and 19-24 are among the commonest types of pottery found in level 1 ; it is interesting to note that nos. 22 and 24 are burnished, though burnishing is rare in level 1 in contradistinction to the numerous specimens of black burnished ware in levels 2 and 3. No. 5, the ribbed vase from late level 1, is a rare type. Fig. 20. Catalogue. No. 1. A 67. Vase. Ht. 19 cm. Decorated with the head of a sheep (?) in full relief, a second head at about the same level was knocked off in antiquity.

Ghirshman, Fouilles du Tepe Giyan, pl. 14, Tombe 31, no. 2 from stratum ?. This tomb, which occurs near the bottom end of that stratum, probably belongs to a period c. 1400-1300 B.c. The analogous vase from Chagar Bazar is one of the latest objects on the site; it was found immediately beneath the surface on one of the highest parts of site B.D. and may be as late as the sixteenth century b.c. No. 2. A 325. Vase. Ht. 10-5 cm. Fragment, below the rim a model of a snake in relief.

Contenau, Manuel d'Arch?ologie Orientale, tome 11, p. 1050, fig. 729). In Babylonia the type probably survived down to the Larsa period, c. 2000 B.c.?the serpent was probably a chthonic symbol, an appropriate form of decoration for a ritual libation vase.

These painted wine jars often contain copper wine strainers of the type shown on Plate xiv c. They are exclusively confined to level 1 and occur mostly in the early intermediate and intermediate phases, suggesting a date of c. 1800-1700 b.c.1 The type is common all over the Upper Habur; there are specimens from T. Hamidi in the Aleppo Museum, and they occur at T. Halaf (cf. von Oppenheim, Der Tell Halaf, Taf. 55, nr. 1). It is possible that ultimately they may be derived from the type of large jar with Oiseaux peignes* designs found in Tepe Giyan stratum 4, eventually degenerating into the jars with simple geometric designs of Giyan 3 and passing into the Habur (cf. the note on no. 13 from Arbit).

Pinkish clay, reddish-brown paint, hatching between bands; discovered with a vase similar to no. 11 in trench 1 at Arbit and therefore probably intermediate level 1. It is interesting to compare this type of vase with the large jars found in Tepe Giyan, stratum 4 (cf. Giyan, op. cit., pl. 31, tombs 106, no. 5, 108, no. 3, 113, no. 3, 115, no. 2, &amp;c.) on which the simple elements of geometric decoration are similar and the vases often have ribbed1 or folded shoulders. But this type of vase seems at Giyan to have disappeared by 1800 B.c.?there are a few degenerate specimens of the type in stratum 3 (cf. tombs 84, no. 3, 90, no. 5). But the early origin of this form in the Zagros Mountains of Iran suggests a possible Iranian origin for Habur ware (cf. p. 104). (S.) Fig. 22. Painted Pottery, Habur Ware. All the vases are from level 1 and are types characteristic of the period with the exception of nos. 1 and 3, which are rare: no. 1 has a design remini- scent of patterns on painted bowls in graves of the Larsa period at Ur. No. 2 can be paralleled in stratum 2 at Tepe Giyan. The wine-jar type, no. 14, often has a copper wine strainer inside it. No. 12 is an old type also found in level 2. The ribbing on nos. 11, 14 is peculiar to the pottery of level 1. Fig. 22. Catalogue. No. 1. A 252. Vase. Rim 14 cm. (base missing).

With the exception of no. 8, which was discovered at Germayir and belongs to level 2, all the pottery belongs to levels 4-5 and corresponds to the fabric known as Ninevite 5 at Quyunjik. Nos. 1 and 3 are probably imports from the Tigris, whereas the crudely painted specimens nos. 6, 7, are local wares and hand made. No. 2, the champagne vase or chalice, is a type of ritual vessel with a long history and in its present form was current in Assyria and in Syria during the earlier half of the third millennium B.c.

Creamy clay, purplish paint, a cuneiform design between bands. This bowl is a typical specimen of the ware known as Ninevite 5, cf. A.A.A. xx. 170, and the unusual clay and paint suggest that the bowl is an import from the region of the Tigris and not of local manufacture, in contradistinction to the much rougher local fabrics of the period, nos. 6, 7, 9. It is probable that this bowl, which was found in a grave also containing nos. 2, 3, dates to shortly before 3000 B.c. approxi- mately to the turn of the early dynastic and Jamdat Nasr period.

The chalice or champagne vase has a long history in western Asia and is found among the chalcolithic painted pottery of T. Halaf, cf. Arpachiyah, Fig. 65, no. 4. The present specimen is typical of the form current in the Ninevite 5 period and should be compared with incised specimens found at Chagar Bazar in the first campagin, cf. Iraq, vol. in, pt. 1, fig. 18, nos. 6, 8. The type is common in Assyria, at Quyunjik, Billa, and Gawra, and it is clearly related to the champagne-glass vases of Carchemish which can hardly be much later than 2500 B.c., cf. C. L. Woolley in A.A.A. vi. A modified form of the type also appears in the richest of the graves at Til-Barsib, cf. F. Thureau-Dangin et M. Dunand, Til-Barsib, pl. xxiii.

The seal was found in B.D., late level 1, but is probably taken over from early level 1 and is another indication that the beginnings of level 1 at Chagar Bazar go back to the First Dynasty of Babylon.

Dr. Frankfort, who has examined a photograph of this seal, suggests that it is a Syrian imitation of an early dynastic seal, Sumerian type, and this seems to me to be most probable, and that the date is just pre-Sargonid. The seal is important because it suggests a date for level 2 of Chagar Bazar which would seem to be round about 2500 b.c. with a margin of a century or two on either side. Ht. 29 mm. Diam. 14 mm.

The cast, third from the top in ?, shows that the plaque represents a trinity of three figures, a god (?), and a goddess suckling a swaddled child. The figures are clothed in long high-necked coats trailing to the ground, and the markings suggest pleats and braiding along jhe front of the coat and across the body below the waist. Between the figures there is a Syrianizing version of the Egyptian 'ankh sign. The goddess appears to be holding her left breast, which is exposed, in her left hand, an attitude represented on metal plaques at T. Halaf and at Troy. The iconography is particularly interesting as it covers a field extending from Syria to the far west of Asia Minor, and appears to be especially at home in Cappadocia.

Following on the archaeological account of Chagar Bazar the article by Mr. C. J. Gadd on pp. 178-83 describes the cuneiform tablets discovered in the course of the same season. These tablets are of considerable importance in giving a further clue to the date of level 1 and it will be seen that on p. 181 Mr. Gadd states that *It may therefore suffice for the present to place these tablets in the two centuries between 2000 and 1800 B.c.' It is of the greatest importance to observe that all the relevant tablet material belongs by stratification to the Early phase of level 1 and the tablets therefore give us an approximate date for the beginning of that period : the early intermediate, intermediate, and late phases of level 1 must indicate a further lapse of time, which I have suggested may take us down as late as 1600 B.c. But it is noteworthy that the material belonging to the late phase is comparatively rare and that the bulk of the objects illustrated in this report is not likely to be much later than 1700 B.c. Finally, we have to allow for the fact that the considerable rebuilding of the city which took place after the early phase of level 1 marked by a rise in floor of 3\ metres between the early and late phases, must imply a certain lapse of time, which may take us into the period subsequent to the fall of the First Dynasty of Babylon. Only two of the tablets, A 385 and A 387, were discovered on the site B.D. : their position relatively to two graves, G in and G 139, is indicated on pp. 119 and 121 respectively. The remaining tablets were all found in the rubbish of the Early level 1 site A.B. and the graves on that site A.B. G 167, 173, 183, cf. p. 123, were of the early intermediate and intermediate periods, subsequent to the tablets; cf. also p. 115 for the stratification of that site. The two clay bullae mentioned on p. 178, A 391, 393, belong to the turn of levels 2-3 and give an approximate date for the period transitional between these two levels.</page><page sequence="65">PLATE XII RiPpi J?M 'h ^?***p|^ ? a (X) ? &lt; ? h CD PQ &lt; h h w a CD w CD ?
