<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAPERS READ BEFORE THE SOCIETY DuJiNG THE SESSION 1892-93. PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.-MIND. By SHADWORTH H. HODGSON, Hon. LL.D. Edinburgh, Hon. Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford; President. I. GREAT is the potnecy of popular usage, especially when enforced by alliteration. Sea and land, hill and valley, heat and cold, light and darkness, wind and wave, systole and diastole, induction and deduction, analysis and synthesis, and so on and so on, are all pairs of opposites, each member of which so naturally and by inevitable association recalls the other, that to speak at any length of the one, without making mention of its fellow, would be all but impossible without shocking that sense of logical propriety, with which the most unphilosophical of mankind are fortunately or unfortunately endowed. The additional force which alliteration lends to this auspicious union of opposites is well exemplified by a passage in Sheridan's play of The Critic, or A TragedEy Rehearsed, where it is made evident by the renowned Don Whiskerandos, that if in a moment of exhilaration you make the winds a present of your cares, doubts, and fears, and the present proves to be unacceptable, you will certaiuly succeed in getting rid of them if, as you inevitably must and will, you " try the wares." This is just what I propose to do this eveniing; I am going to "try the waves." My Address last Session was on the subject of Matter. Popular usage enforced by alliteration suggests that my present Address should be on the subject of' Mind. The Philosophy of Mrind is a popular subject, and I obey the impalse to speak of it with the less reluctance, because it is perhaps best approached by way of a prior consideration of its suipposed opposite and twin brother Matter, such as I endeavoured last year to lay before you. Mind and Matter are like the Castor and Pollux of mythology, of whom we read, that wben one lives, the other descends to the shades, when one descends to the shades, the other revives and lives. So also in philosophy, when Mind is believed in as a reality, the necessity A</page><page sequence="2">9 for Matter being real disappears from view; when Matter is held to be real, the reality of Mind becomes a superfluous and even an embarrassing lhuxury. There is only one objection to my enteriing on this engaging subject. It is that I am not a popular philosopher, aTnd if I treat of it at all, I fear I mnst treat of it in a very unpopular fashion. All I can promise is to be plain, simple, and I hope intelligible. And there is this advantage in having spoken of Matter last year, namely, that I may proceed at once, or at any rate with very little farther prologue, to apply the same method to the subject of Mind, and bring it to the same standard. Yoti may remember that in my last year's Address I said: " Mind and Maatter are both objects of consciousness, thoughi whether MIind, like Matter, is a real object, may here be left undecided. About the reality of Matter there is nLo sort of doubt, except such as may be thrown upon it by the assumption of the reality of Mind. For if Miiud is a reality, then the perception of Matter may well be its creature, and as perception of it is the only ultimate evidence of its reality, its reality sinks back into the position of an idea " (Proceedings, Vol. ii, No. 1, Part I, p. 4). In that Address I showed (1) what MIatter was as a percept, (2) how its reality in the full sense, the sense of real and efficient condition, was inferred from that percept takeri together with others, and (3) what the nature of that Real Condition was conceived to be by Newiton and other men of science, namely, that they conceived it as a coherent occupancy of space; both coherence and occupancy involving what we call Force, and Matter and Force being, consequently conceived as inseparable elements composing one material and active reality. You will remeinber that I did not attempt to furnish actual proof either of the reality of 'Matter in the full sense of the term reality, or of the truth of the Newtonian conception of it as involving Force. I contented myself with indicating tile wvay in which, as I conceived, both points were capable of being proved, and giving some reasons for justifying my acceptance of them. More was not required for the purposes of that Address, nor would the occasion have permitted me to euter at length on so large an enquiry. In philosophy, the reality of Matter in the full sense of the term reality, that is, as an efficient agent and real condition,* is open to an injitial doubt, with which neither the physicist nor the geometer have any, need to concern themselves. They deal with Matter and with # For the distinctive meaning of these terms I may refer my hearers to Trwy Address for 1883, The Two Senses of Reality, and more particularly to the ?ote be*tring the same title, which is appended to my Address for 1886, The Re-organi- salion of PZiloSopAhy.</page><page sequence="3">3 Space as realities in precisely the same sense (whatever that may be) in which they are understood and accepted by everyday thought or as we may call it, pre-philosophic intelligence. They are in no way called upon to go behind the popu]ar accepr1ation of their reality. But for the philosopher the case is different. He has to deal with Mind as well as Matter, and Mind has reality for everyday thought or pre- philosophic intelligence, in precisely the same way and to the same degree that Matter has. At this point it is, that the initial doubt I spoke of arises. For, as I said in the passage quoted from my last Address, if Mind is a reality, that is, a real existent in the fall sense of real and efficient condition, and is justified as such by philosophy, then the very perception of Matter may turn oat to be its creature, a consistent hallucination or idea, the laws of which are of quite different nature from those commonly understood as physical; and if so, the whole of our common-sense conception of the world we live in would undergo a radical alteration. An entirely new vista would then be opened for science, since all laws of Matter would then have to be subsumed under, or show-n to be cases of, laws of Mind, and in consequence of tbis, all the positive physical sciences would become branches of the single science of Psychology. Now pre-pbilosophic or common-sense thought has no inkling of this possibility. It accepts Mind as the immaterial and Matter as the material Reality, each governed by its own laws, psychical in the one, physical in the other; and probably for the most part imagines, that the immaterial reality has, at some remote but undefined epoch, created the material reality, and imiplanted in it those modes of action which r esult in what are called the Laws of Physical Nature. As to haman minds, it holds, I presume, in the same undefined way, that they owe their natare and genesis, and the laws of their action, as immaterial realities, to the same creative source. Mysterious and indeed often wholly inscrutable as it confesses the nature and laws of Mind to be, and particularly so in that department of them wbich comprises the mutual action and re-action of Mind and Mlatter, yet of the real existence of an immaterial substance and agent common- sense thought entertains no doubt whatever. Something real and immaterial it considers there must be, though its ultimate nature may be an unrevealed secret. And there it is content to leave the whole question, or rather there and at that point the sabject is frequently taken up by religious thought, diverse creeds are built upon thle common basis of these meagre pre-philosophic conceptions, and in this way the interests of religion are often most needlessly enlisted against any attempt to analyse those facts of experience, of which these conceptions are the expression. But with this branch of the subject we are not now directly concerned.</page><page sequence="4">4 The conception of Mind as an immaterial but sub tautive agent, or a reality in the full sense, is the root idea of what may be called one half of philosophy, if we take the contrasted conception of Matter as the root idea of the other balf. Both conceptions are, as I have said, adopted wit.h undoubting acceptance by common-sense thought; both are held by it to have the immediate evidence of consciousness or experience in their favour. Both conceptions therefore are proper and necessary subjects of philosophy, and among its most irrecusable analysanda or explicanda. To-night I have to attempt to do for the conception of Mind what last year I attempted to do for that of Matter, namely, show how philosophy goes to work in first analysing the percept of Mind, our supposed actual perception of it, and secondly testing its reality, as the agent -upon which consciousness and perception themselves immediately depend, and exhibiting, if possible, its analysis or nature as such an agent. In every instance the method of philosophy is, first to ask what the subject in question is immediately perceived or known as, or what specifically it is which we m3au by the name we give it, and then secondly (supposing we find a positive meaning under the name) to enquire how it comes to exist, and how it behaves as an existent, that is, in other words, what its nature is in its character of a real existent or real condition. To begin with, there is a certain parallelism between the two things, Mind and Matter, in that the preliminary definitions of both are that which definitions. Matter, I said last year, is the that which is perceived in touching, seeing, and moving simaltaneously. Similarly Mind may be preliminarily defined as the that which per- ceives or is conscious, that is, feels, thinks, and wills. Of this we seem to have an immediate perception, just as we seem at first sight to have an immediate perception of material objects, though this latter perception is afterwards broken up, as it were, by analysis, and shown to be not simple but complex, not an immediate percep- tion of a single reality, but formed by associating the notices of two senses at least, when simaltaneously exercised. In the case of Mind also we plainly seem to have an immediate perception of the that which feels, thinks, and wills, inasmuch as we identify it with our Self, not distinguishing it from the Ego, but spoaking of it as Ior We. We and our Mind are one; we and oar Soul are one. Mind, Soul, and Self, are three names for the same tbing, in common-sense thought, as apparently an object of immediate consciousness or experience. Such I take to be a true description uf the experience common to everyone, which we call a perception of our own Mind or Self, as we not only find it previously to attempting an analysis of it, but also as it cleaves to us throughout life, even after analysis of it,</page><page sequence="5">notwithstanding that we are then able to distinguish the concrete perception, which is the appearance, from the elements composing it, which are discerned by the analysis, and are the reality corres- ponding to the appearance. Now the first question proposed by philosophy, ancd which has to be answered by subjective or philosophic analysis, is this, Whether this experience really contains, as it appears to do, an imnmediate perception of the agent or substance designated Mind or Self, as the agent which feels, thinks, and wills, in processes of consciousness. There is no doubt that we have the common-sense experience I have described, as a common-sense ex- perience. And, I may repeat, there is also no doubt, that we continue to have this same common-sense experience all our lives, whether we can give its philosophic analysis or not. This makes no difference whatever with regard to the common-sense experience, just as it makes no difference with regard to our common-sense experience, say for instance of water, whether we can or cannot give its chemical analysis into the two gases hydrogen and oxygen. The first question which philosophy puts to every piece of experience is the qnestion WVhat ? that is to say, What it is that we immediately experience therein, and what (if atiything) we import by thought or imagination. Analysis has two things to do, first to discern wbat we immediately experience, secondly to discriminate this from what we mediately infer or imagine. Now just as in attentively looking at a building or a landscape, the first general impression gives place to a more accurate one, in which new details are discerned, and those first observed assume a new character, so also it is when we attentively observe any piece of experience what- ever, even if it be what is called internal experience. The first impression does not change into soruethirng which is not experience, but into another experience differing from the first, and also more accurate in case we observe attentively, without allowing pre-con- ceived ideas to mix tbemselves with the phenomeina observed. Careful analysis issues, not in adding, but in eliminating pre- conceived ideas from the experience analysed; just as in the case of the building or the landscape, the more closely we look, the less likely we are to think we Eee what really we only imagine. Thus the experience which was initially one becomes two, the same and not the same; there is a former and a latter state of the same experience. The term experience itself acquires a double meaning, experience before and experience after or in aualysis; the former the source of common-sense conceptions, the latter of philosophic. It is not that philosophy discovers a hidden or noumenal reality behind phenomena, but that the reality which it discovers is a new an(d more accurate shape of the phenomena themselves. Thus it is that</page><page sequence="6">an appeal to experience means one thing in common-sense thinking, and quite another thing in philozophic thinking, notwithstanding that no hidden or non menal reality ever comes into view. When people appeal to intuition, it usually neans that they have got to some phenomenon which they might, but do not choose to, analyse farther, and which therefore they take as ultimate; for if they meant simply what could not be analysed with their present method or present degree of effort, there would be no need of the special term intuition to describe the experience of it. Now when we puit the analytical question What ? to the common- sense experience of the Mind or Self, which I have just described as a perception of the aoent feeling, or thicking, or willing, we find in the first place, that it contains literally nothing which corresponds to the agent, the Mind or Self, which we seem at first sight to per- ceive immediately at work. We can assign no whatness to our supposed perception of it; that supposed perception has no positive content. The only experience we could possibly have of it would be self-consciousness. The self perceived in that consciousness must as a percept have a content, if it is really perceived at all; and yet when, by a further act of self-consciousness, we attentively scrutinise t.he supposed perception, we find a blank in the consciousness where the positive whatness, the whatness of the Self, should be. We never perceive what ice are, who feel, or think, or will, apart or distin- guishable in any way fromi the process-content of the feeling, thinking, or willing, of which we are supposed to be the Subject or Agent. We perceive a distinctive charazcter in the process-contents which are most habitnal; but we do not perceive the Subject as distinct from that habitual character. Perhaps I may make my meaning clearer by referring to the coutrasted case of Matter. In analysing our perception of material objects, which also seems, in common-sense expelience, to be an immediate perception, we find that every part of the immediately perceived object, that is, every part of wbat in my last year's Address I called percept-Matter, is accounted for by some positive element in immediate perception, some mode or other of visual, tactual, or motor sensation. The whatness of percept-Matter consists of positive data. Not so with percept-Mind, if I may use the expression for wbat might be but is not. There is no percept-Mind. The place of Mind or Self, in the common-sense experience we are considering, is a blank, when that ex-perience is analytically scrutinised. It wholly conisists of process-contents of consciousness, in or among which nothing comes forward as the agent or Subject which has or experiences tbem. It may be said, that neitlher in the case of material objects do we</page><page sequence="7">immediately perceive the reality, or real Matter, which we r-present as the real substance or agent impressing our sensibility, or which is the real condition of our perceiving the percept-Matter. This reality is represented only, is (rightly or wrongly) inferred, not immediately perceived. And this is quite true, but it does not touch the case of Mind. There is real percept-Matter, a positive complex perception, to go upon in the former case; there is the complex sensation of a visible, tangible, and resisting solid, which we repeat as a representa- tion, and infer to exist as a reality, below the limits of our sensibiiity; there is no real percept-Mind, as a positive perception to go upon in the latter case; there is nothinog upon which a representation or an inference (right or wrong) can be founded. It is the very premisses for inferTing a real Mind that fail us, the very substance and contenE of the idea. In other words, Mind, Soul, Self, as objects of imnmediate perception, and therefore also as inferred realities, as these terms must be u-nderstood in philosophy (though not of course as objects of common-sense thought), are no more than empty names. It is sometimes argued by those who are aware of the fatal blanlk in immediate perceptions where Mind or Self should be, in that common-sense experience which we call our perception of them, and who are yet unwilling to give up the psychical reality which the words express, and which they have come to regard as one of the ultimate bases of philosophy, and not the least important of them,- it is sometimes argued, that this blank in the perception is the very thing which from the nature of the case we ought to expect. They urge that the Entity, whose essential nature it is to be the Subject, of feeling, thinking, and willing, cannot be expected to reveal itself in immediate experience as an Object, since it would thereby divest itself of its purely subjective character, ancd in fact would de- naturalise itself in the very act and instant of manifesting its peculiar capacities. But this contention, though highly ingenious, is liable to two most serious objections. First, it is a remarkable instance of making an Entity out of the puirely abstract fact or moment of feeling, thinking, or willing. Secondly, the entity which it imagines is conceived as a reality, notwithstanding that objectivity, which in all other cases is essential to our conception of reality, is in its case admittedly impossible. It is in fact the object of a daring assumption. At the same time, since it is impossible to perceive an abstraction as an entity, and doubly impossible to do so, when that entity is of a kind incapable of objectivity, it is easy and plausible enough, when once we have imagined and assumed such an entity, to think of it as something which must necessarily remain transcendent, and be represented by a blank in immediate experience.</page><page sequence="8">Now this doctr ine plainly sacrifices the miin point in the common-sense conception, which apparently it is devised to defend; it sacrifices the immediateness of the knowledge which common sense supposes us to have of the Sabject of consciousness. It there- fore stands, on this ground, in flat contradiction to the common- sense conception. But in fact it sacrifices mach more, though it endeavours to hide the loss by an assumption. Along with that immediate knowledge it sacrifices the evidence for the real existence, as well as for the nature, of the Subject conceived as ihe special Subject of consciousness. For if, in the experience knowvn as self- consciousness, we have literally no knowledge of a Self, we have no right to affirm its existence as a reality with positive functions; it is for knowledge a zero, with no positive attributes or predicates, and if, notwithstanding this. it is assamed as a reality, it can only be assumed as an unknowable Thin-in-itself, a prohibitive full stop to further knowvledge. To take it, therefore, as the special Subject of consciousness, or to imagine it as of psychical nature, if the word p)sychical is to have any positive meaning, is self-contradictory. Common sense, whichi imagines itself to have an immediate percep- tion of the Mlind or Self, may, and indeed must, logically pretend to k-now, not only that it really exists, but also something of what is meant by terms like mental, spiritual, or psychical. It may be mistaken, but it is not illogical in those pretensions. But the transcendental psychlologists who hold the theory just spoken of are in a very different case. They insist on the reality of a special Subject of consciousness, while abandoning the data from which alone the knowledge of it can be derived. They speak of it, in con- tradictory terms, as at ouce self-evident and unknowable. They continue to assume as an unknowable realitY the object of a concep- tion which they surrender as erroneous. The common-sense conception that the universe consists of two great classes of entities. Persons and Things, Minds or Subjects and Matter or Objects,-a conception which confuses distinctions which belong to Knowing with distinctions which belong to Being or realities known,--is at the root of this transcendentai theory. The tbeory assumes the truth of the confused common-sense conception, and then works it out to the contradictory conclusion which, owing to its confusion, it involves. It is not thus that the conceptions of common sense should be dealt with. The true plhilosophical method prescribes our approaching reality always from the side of knowledge, not by making an initial assumption concerning it. The distinction between Subject and Object is primarily a distinction within know- ledge itself, thal is, has its roots in the process-contents of conscious- ness as they are immediately known in consciousness, prior to any</page><page sequence="9">9 qacstion arising, or any Inowledge being attained, of the Real Existents concerning, which that consciousness, as it accumulates in memory and develops into a consistent experience, gives us know- ledge. In its original or primary shape the distinction is not between Subject and Object as Real Existents, but between Subjective and Objective aspects of the process-contents of consciousness, prior to consciousness itself being distinguished from Real Existents, or Real Existents from consciousness. The true way of dealing with common-sense conceptions such as those of Persons and Things, Subjects and Objects, Mind and Matter, is not first to assume that they are substantially true, and then endeavour to work them up into a consistent system, but to take them as they stand, and confront them with the phenlomena or facts of experience, out of which they have been framed without the control of analysis. We thus set the true conceptions, by which I mean those which we form out of experience under the control of analysis, over against those which have grown uap, and continue to grow up, out of the same experience, without being subjected to analytical control. The analysis moreover furnishes the means of explaining where and why the common-sense conceptions are faulty, where and why they are correct. Philosophy is thus nothing more than the careful re-thinking of the pre-pbilosophic thoughts, which we have either taken up from tradition, or have ourselves added, concerning the universe of things of whiich we are a part. Nor is there a thought or an imagination, concerning any portion of that universe, which can escape our analytical scrutiny. Thoughts which we are competent to frame we are also competent to repeat and analyse. II. With regard, then, to the first of the two main questions with which we have to deal, namely, what Mind is immediately perceived or known as, our answer must be purely negative. It is not imme- diately perceived or known at all. At first sight this negative answer to our first question would appear to involve an equally decided negative to the second, namely, whether a percept-M1ind is a reality in the full sense of the term, anld if so, what are its nature and functiotis, that is, the nature and functions of real Mind. For it might seem that about nothing no questions can be put.; if there is no percept-Mind, there can be Ino reality corresponding to it, no real agent intended by it;-cadit qwcestio. But tllis would be treatingr tlle comnon-sense conception of Mind in the most unfair and unplhilosophical manner. That con- ceptioIn is itself a part of our -xplUcanduni, tllat is, as much a part</page><page sequence="10">10 of our subject-matter as are the phenomena or facts of experience out of which it is framed, and out of -which we also in philosopby have to frame, if possible, some more valid conception, a conception in accordance with a more accurate analysis of the facts. Our analysis ougoht to afford us the means of explaining not only where and why the common-sense conception is faulty, but also where and why it is correct. Now two points may be discerned in the common-sense conception of Mind; first, that there is an immediate perception of it, an idea which we have just seen to be faulty, and secondly, that what is so perceived is the real agent concerned in conscious processes; and the idea that conscious processes depend immediately upon some real agent, different from themselves, is undoubtedly correct. We shall see some of the groundls which justify this assertion as we proceed. Where the transcendental tbeory w ent wrong was, as we lhave seen, in assunling- that this real agent, though of a special, that is, a psychical nature, must be transcendent and unknowable, because we have no immiediate perception of it while actually at work. This assumption is shown to be wrong by the contradiction in which it involves us; and fortunately so, since, had it been correct, it would have closed the door against all further knowledge, by the inscrutable nature of the real agent which by its hypothesis it sets up. The nature of the real agent in conscious processes being assumed to be unknowable, its existence remaining, unquestioned as before, there would have been a gulf between the operations of that agent on the one hand and their dependent consequences, the processes of consciousness, on the other. The connection between cause and effect (to use the common-sense but familiar terms), which it is the aim of all sciences, and therefore of psychology, to ascertain, would have been held, and with truth, to be as urnknowable as the nature of the cause, the real but transcendent agent. Avoiding, then, both the pitfall of the transcendental psychologists, and the common-sense idea, that we have an immediate perception of Mind as the ageijt in conscious processes, let us look for a moment at the other point involved in the common-sense conception, namely, that some real agent, different from consciousness itself, is concerncd in initiating and maintaining consciousness, in its three departments of feeling, thinking, and willing. It remains to consider this idea in tlhe light of the two requirements which we have just ascertained, namelv, first, that we must have some positive perception or know- ledge of tlle agent in qnestion, without which it would be to us a mere word, and secondly, that our knowledge of it as the agent immediately concerined in consciousness muss be an inference and not an immediate perception.</page><page sequence="11">11 I hope I have succeeded in making clear to you thc neces.sity of these two r3qrirements, and how inievitably they spring from con- fronting the common-sense conception of mind as the agent in con- sciousness with the facts of experience, the process-contents of consciousness in feeling, thinking, and willing, which on a careful scrutiny are foand to yield no immediate perception of the agent. To perceive clearly that, if we are to attain any knowledge of the real agency concerned in consciousness, we must have some positive and independent knowledge of what we afterwards infer to be the agent, independently I mean of any conscious processes which reveal it in the character of the agent immediately, aild therefore also that our knowledge of it in that character, or as the agent in consciouis- ness, must be mediate knowledge, gained by way of inference, not of immediate perception, is essential to the further consideration of the qnestion. I make, therefore, no apology for thus repeating, as I have done, the two requirements, though I fear .t the risk of wearying you. There is another point also to which I slhould like to call your attention before going farther, a point wbich may serve still more clearly to mark progress, and cast a ray of light both over the obscure path we have been treading hitherto, and over that part of the course which we have yet to ru-n. The point is this. The correction we have now made in the common-sense conception of Mlind entirely alters the face and disposition, so to speak, of the whole subject-matter, and brings it into harmony with the principles of philosophical method. I mean that, wbereas we began with enquiring into the nature of an assumed real agent, Mind, assumed to exist as a reality by the common-sense conception of it, we now, from our present starting point onwards, begin with conscious pro- cesses, or process-contents of consciousness, immediate to perception, process-contents which fall under the three heads of feeling, thinling, and willing, and then proceed to enquire into their genesis and governance, that is, into the nature of the real agency upon which they depend. In doing this we first attempt to ascertain, by analysis of the process-contents of consciousness, the meaning of all such terms as Reality, Real Existent, Agent, Subject, Object, Condition, Dependence, and so on, before proceeding to select by hypothesis any object or set of objects, as the real agent upon which consciotusness most probably depends for its existence and maintenance. We are thus in the broad highway of philosophical method. Of course I do not mean that I am going, to lay before you the analysis of the string of terms which I have enumerated. That would be to enter upon a whole course of pbilosophy. I mean merely to indicate the nature and iuethod of the work, which would have to</page><page sequence="12">12 be done by any one attempting to frame a satisfactory theory of the real agent and agency concerned in conscious processes, and to show that, by correcting, as we have done, the common-sense conception of Mind, we have pat the enquiry which that conception initiates, but initiates by an assumption, upon a sound philosophical footing. A few geueral considerations bearing on this great theme are all that I can hope to offer you this evening. In the first place, then, I would remark, that the enquiry into the real agent aind agency concerned in conscious processes is strictly and properly a psychological, not. a philosophical enquiry; just the same in this respect as the enquiry into the nature of Mind, which is initiated by the assumption involved in the commor..sense conception of it. Both alike are psychological. The new footing upon which we have put the latter enquiry makes no change in the department rf scientific knowledge to which it belongs. What we have now done is simply to show that, as a psychological enquiry, it pre. supposes and depends upon a preliminary survey and analysis of the whole field of consciousness or experience by plhilosopllical metbods, that in short it can only be satisfactorily pursued in dependence upon lhe results of a purely subjective and philosophical analysis. This I dare say several of those who hear me will recognise as an often repeated doctrine of mine, and will perhaps be mentally cryinog crambe repetita. The fact of the matter is, that the distinctive and cardinal conceptions, upon wbich philosophy is organised, are so few and at the same time so closely bound up with the whole subject, that we are constantly coming upon one or other of them from the most different quarters. The doctrine that psychology pre-supposes philosophy does nothing more than express the value of the fact that, in all systematic knowledge, the study of the what, that is, the meaning of any term for consciousness, takes precedence of all other questions concerning the object named by that term. The next effect of this change of footing which I have to remark is the following. In consequence of thus distinguishing the provinces of philosophy and psychology, both lines of thought are lifted once for all out of the region of a crude anthropomorp)hism, which sees in the universe a man making a world, and we are enabled to see in man and his world a special case of larger agencies and laws, the infinite whole of whicb, includinig its enclave or special case, we name the universe. I will try briefly to state how this is brought about. In thought, and therefore in philosophy, we never get beyond conscious- ness, we always ask what things are known as, that is, what they are for consciousness; when we speak of anything as in itself, or as out of, beyond, or existing independently of consciousness, it is always thought or consciousness whzich so represents it, anid as it were</page><page sequence="13">throws it out of itself; so that we retain it in consciousness in the very act of thinking of it as excluded from consciousness. Philo- sophy may be said to begin, or have one of its beginnings, in consciously recognising this fact. But what is the consequence ? Plainly this, that in the meaning of the term consciousness itself two senses must be distinguished, two aspects of consciousness. There is first that sense of the term, or aspect of the thing, in which it is all- embracing, and in whichi it is a knowing, a process-content, and nothing more, the subjective aspect of the infinite universe. There is secondly the sense of the term, or aspect of the thing-, in which it is a particular existent, the consciousness belonging to this or that individual, having countless other things outside and indepencdent of it, and outside and independent of countless other things, of all other things in fact except the organism to which it belongs, and the forces with which that organism comes into contact. And these two senses or two aspects are not two consciousnesses but one. One and the same particular individual consciousness, or consciousness as an existent, has also the other seilse or aspect in which it is all- embracing, in which it is sinmply a knowing; and both aspects oz co'nsciousness are objective to consciousness itself, which is a proces&amp; of perpetual self-objectification. Now this distinction within consciousness itself is wholly alien from, and unrecognised by, the common-sense conception of Mind, in which conception both members of it, both aspects of consciousness, are taken confusedly together, undistinguished from each other. And yet, at the same time, consciousness i.s common g,round, is the common subject-matter, of both philosophy and psychology. To recognise this necessary distinction between the two senses or aspects of consciousness, and to refer the investigation of them severally to two distinct departments of thought, is for the first time to draw the true fulndamental line of demarcation between philosophy and psychology, and to place both departments upon their really natural and logical foundation. To philosophy belongs the entire range of consciousness in its whatness or as a knowing, that is to say, the whole content of the sentient, emotional, imaginative, intellectual, volitional life of man, his moral, esthetic, and religious, as well as his perceptual and cognitive endowment; to philosophy the analysis, classification, and comparative estimate of all feelings and ideas, as well in respect of their value and dignity in a moral, as of their truth in a speculative, point of view, his theories as to his own place in nature, and of the world's place in the universe, his hopes and fears for eternity, the governance of his life here, the possibility of another life hereafter. To psychology belongs the investigation of the laws which govern the genesis of consciousness as an existent,</page><page sequence="14">]14 the actual origination and concatenation of those processes of con- sciousness, the content of which assumes all those varied shapes and forms which I lhave enumerated as constituting its whatness, laws which formulate the maniner of their dependence npon the real agency, which lies hidden somewhere or other within the individual organism. You will, I think, see at once what a radical change this redistribution of the subject-matter of philosophy and psychology, makes in the importance to be attr ibuted to the common-sense conception of Mind. Prior to the redistribution, that conception cannot fail to be regarded as one of the great corner stones of philosopby, being, as it then is, the philosophical expression for the reality of reason and moral purpose, where these are the most indisputably demonstrable. In this view the supposed psychical or spiritual agency of Mind is a tenet to be fought for, lived for, died for, as something, essential and indispensable to the moral, intellectual, and religious nature of man, the Divinre principle withir him, robbed of which (supposing it were possible) he would become a clod, and the universe itself be in reality no more than a dull mass of blind and aimless mecbanism. For where in the whole univelse could the principle of a mural and iiitellectual life be found, if it were not found in man, the crown and flower of the visible creation ? Every- thing of value in philosophy seems bound up with the truth of the doctrine, that we have an inmmediate perception of the psychical or spiritual nature of Mind, as conitradistinguished from M&gt;atter with its merely mechanical laws, so long as we fail to see the tiue logical connection between the questions of whaatness and of genesis, and consequently fail to bring psychology into its true relation of dependence on philosophy. But from the moment that this relation is perceived and this change made, the whole scene alters, and psychological doctiines as to the nature of the agent in cousciousness, and the common-sense conception of Mlind among them, lose their sometime importance. It matters nothing, except from the point of view of positive science, and of philosophy so far as it stands in relation to it, what the agent, what the mecihanism, may be, upon wbich conscious processes depend, when once the whole value of conscious life in all its departments is admitted to consist in the whatness or nature of its con tt,nt as consciousness, and the analysis and estimate of that nature are transferred to the domain of philosophy. I meani that, except for the reservation just stated, it makes literally no difference to any moral or intellectual interest of man, whether conscious processes depend immediately upoil a material brain or upon an immaterial Psyche. The value of his consciousness lies in what it is, not in that upon</page><page sequence="15">13 which it depends; and the value of that upon which it depends is a value reflected back upon it from its connection with the consciouis- ness, which depends uponl it for its existence. The nature of consciousness is literally unquestionable and ultimate, as I tried to make evidernt in my last year's Address (Proceedings, Vol. ii, No. 1, Part I, p. 20) ; that is to say, in other words, the distinction between nature and genesis applies to the whole and every part of it, and no genesis of its nature can be assigned, or even be conceived as possible. At the same time the reservation, " except from the point of view of positive science, and of philosophy so far as it stands in relation to ic," is a very important one. But here the advantage is entirely on the side of a material as against an immaterial agent. As regards positive science, the science of psychology, the advantage is obvious. An immaterial agent is for us a mere name, and cannot be construed to positive thought. It affords literally no foothold to speculation, no material for observation, experiment., orhypothesis. Physiological psychology on the other hand possesses in nearal substance, and the physical forces to which it is subject, abundant material for positive investigation in all these ways. It is a branch of science in wbich result after result is being daily obtained and registered. Again as regards philosophy in relation to science, that is, as making with mathematical, physical, and psychological science one complete system of huiman knowledge, the service rendered by the conception of a material agent of consciousness is conspicaons and nndeniable. A material agenit of consciousness preserves, an im- material agent breaks, that unity in the frame and constitution of the positively known or knowable world, whicb, wherever it can be discovered or legitimately inferred, is justly dear to the logical instincts of mankind. The disappearance of an immaterial Mind from the scene of reality would be the disappearance of a heterogeneous element, the existence of which would he as difficult to account for, as its nature is difficult to conceive. To be able frankly to dismiss it as a fiction would be a great relief. The mystery of Matter would then alone remain insoluble; one mystery in place of the two, which now baffle the powers of human insight. And is it not a fiction ? Is it not a replica, painted by the imagi- nation uncontrolled by the criticism of subjective analysis, of the concrete human being, constituted as he is of two componexnt parts, heterogeneous, but intimately united, his material organism and his immaterial consciousness? Consciousness is what is really immaterial in man, his feelings, thoughts, volitions; his consciousness including all it.s process-contents. To this immaterial component he erroneously attributes agency, because in imaginative thinking he frames purposes and foresees results, befcre lie realises them in action; ancd thus an</page><page sequence="16">1i; initiative, a power of originating action, seems to him to reside in the forecasting consciousness. But the logically priov ideas of agent and agency,-wbence come they ? The idea of agent can come only from his experience of his own organism in contact with bodies external to it; that of agency only from this experience in conjunc- tion with the sense of effort or strain, which he feels in handling them and in resisting their impact. Thus, from both components of himself as a concrete conscious agent, ho takes features which he then attributes to one of them, his consciousness, alone, and imagines it as a real agent, a body within his visible and tangible body, con- scious of purpose and initiating, action. In the early periods of human history, he appears to have identified this inner man, or imagined agent, sometimes with the breath, sometimes with the blood. And the course of thiTiking upon which he thus enters, if allowed to continue uncriticised and uncorrected, finds its only possible culmination and conclusion in the idea, that the real ag ent must be in itself something transcendent and unknowable. III. Many people seem to have a holy horror of what they call robbing the world of its mystery. But I think that what they really mean to denounce is forgetfulness of its mystery, or paying such exclusive attention to what is not nmysterious as to ignore the mystery which really encompasses it, and sometimes even to deride those who would press the fact upon their notice. If this is really their meaning, I confess that I entirely concur with them. The fact, that for human intelligence omnia. exeunt in mysterium, is a fact of experience as certain as any fact can be, and one which is of the first importance in all philosophical speculation. But mystery is of no value for its own sake. To the eye of Omniscience no mystery exists. Mystery is the name for the necessary limitations of a filite intelligence. If the views which I have just laid before you are correct, there is one ultimate limitation, one ultimate mystery for mankind, under which all others, which belong to the Order of Genesis, may be brought, the existence of Matter, the origination and maintenance of the Material World. This is just the same result to which I came in my last year's Address; only that this year I have approached the same great theme from the side of Mind. Of these two great common-sense or pre-philosophic ideas, Matter I then tried to show you was a reality, Mind I have now tried to show you is a fiction, and unreal. In philosophy we start with an abundance of common- sense ideas, which are the shape into which all our pre-philosophic experience has been cast, the form in which it exists for us, in</page><page sequence="17">consequence of the u-iwatched operations of the neural mechanism w7hich is its soarce of supply. Awaking to philosophy, or beginning to philosophise, means beginning to watzh the process-contents of consciou.sness a.s they stream in from this source. We are then watching experience as it actually occurs to us, instead of merely watching, as before, the familiar forms of it which in its anwatched periods it has already assumed. Some of the more constant anid deeply rooted among these forms, when they are of an abstract character, are what are called a priori forms or ideas. On the transcendental theory of Mind they are the modes in which the transcendent Subject operates upon wbatever material is furnished it from elsewhere, or possibly from itself in another capacity. Others of the more constant forms belonging to the unwatched period, which are concrete, that is to say, picturable each for itself as a more or less complex whole, are fixeed ideas or opinions, or literally prejudices in the strict sense of that term. Others again there are which, though modifiable on more searching reconsideration, are such as to turn out in the main correct; that is, they will be found warranted by futurc experience, when most accurately watched. Nor have we, ultimately and in the long run, any other standard of truth than this,-the verdict of a carefully watched experience. In this sense I would be understood when I say, as I have said so often, that common-sense experience is tho explicanddum of philosophy. In philosophy we watch experience as it actual ly occurs, and in so doing analyse and explain the forms it has already assumed, replacing them by, or modifving them into, other forms, wbich again in their turn await their verification or dismissal by the same process. It is only the distinct consciousness and formulation of this process, as the one essential process in philosophising, that are in any way new. The process itself may be traced as a method of thinking in the writings of all genuine philosophers which have come down to us. The course of its development is the tiue course of philosophical development itself, evidenced from stage to stage of it by the svstems or theories which philosophers have propounded. and in which an iciereasing preponderance of the subjective aspect is clearly discernible, as well as a more distinctly marked antithesis between the two aspects, subjective and objective. It is only very gradually that the thought and speculation of philosopbers influence and modify the conceptions of common-sense or everyday thinking; and the influence which they do exert resides far more in the frank and full exhibition of their ways and methods of thinking, than in the systems in which they attempt to embody their results. It is this character of laying bare the working, of the mind, in grappling with thoughlits, which B</page><page sequence="18">render.i the writings of the great masters of thonght perennially instructive, and quickens them with an everlasting freshness. The interest lies in the Sic cogitabat. As philosophers stand to the world at large, so iu the individual philosopher, the philosophic period of his own life, and the thoughts which belong to it, stand to the pre-philosophic period and its ideas, which of course continue to exist, though subjected to a modifying process, side by side with those wbich belong to his philosophic life. Wihen the philosophic epoch dawns for any man, he begins to be aware of the discrepancy between the world as it is seen in everyday or common-sense conceptions, and the world as he is beginnirng to see it in the light of analysis. The pre-philosophic world loses its unique and absolute chtaracter; the philosophic world shines, as it were, more and more clearly throug,h it; and his task is to reduce the newly-dawning world of analysis to a system consistent in itself, and to harmonise it part for part with the common-sense conceptions which are still dominant aroand him. Hume was a great philoso- phical sceptic just because, while clearly seeing the difference between the two worlds, he never succeeded in systematising his philosophic world, aud therefore still less in bringing, it into harmony with the pre-philosophic world of daily life. Be had nothing wherewith to replace its lost absoluteness. If these views are in the main correct, and they are the best I have to lay before you, it follows that it is a great mistake, and in fact one of the illulsions of common-sense thinking, to suppose, that what philosophy professes or attempts to do, is to discover the ultimate real essence of the Universe, or of Matter, or of Mtind, or of the Causal Nexus or Efficiency, or of anything else taken as a real existent or objective reality, in the absolutist sense of common-sense thinking. What it does attempt to do is to discover thie simplest, most accnrate, atid therefore the ultimnate way in which we must think of the things which are called by these coxim)n-sense names, and thought of under these common-sense conceptions. The ultimates at whichi it endeavours and hopes to arrive are ultimates in knowledge, the ult.imate elements, laws, and results of human thought and experience. Philosophy, in showing the falsity of that absolute character which attaches to all common-sense conceptions, cannot logically set up other absolute conceptions in their place, since its main and distinctive contention is, that Realities are known solely and alone through the experience we have and the conceptions we form of them, and not as if we had an a priori knowledge with which we could compare the knowledge gained by experience, Existence itself beino objective to consciousness in its wide sense of a knowing, even when it is thought of as independent of consciousness.</page><page sequence="19">A!thoug,h, therefore, the whole work and intercourse of the world is carried on, and necessarily so, on the basis of common-sense con- ceptions, yet common-sense thinking never comes into collision with philosophy, unless it sets up a claim to be itself philosophy, by taking one or more of its unanalysed conceptions as the foandation on which to build a theory of existence. The motive for doing so is usually either of a theological or of an anti-theological character, not drawn simply and solely from the desire of knowledge. Some positive con- ception of the nature of the infinite universe, a conception which may be made to cover its unknown as well as its positively known or knowable region, seems eminently desirable to all who have a specific practical view of life to cherish and inculcate, whether that view be optimist or pessimist, or, as I said before, of a theological or anti- theological kind. The common-sense conception which most readily prusents itself to advocates of the former class is the conception of Mlind; to advocates of the latter class it is that of Matter, the existence of which they endeavour to represent as commensurate with our ideas of infinity and eternity. I hazarded some criticism of this endeivour in my, last year's Address. The whole of my Address to-night may be considered as in some sort a criticism of the corres- poniding endeavour in the case of Mind. But there is still a final word to say concerning this latter concep- tion. It is true that, it has no pretension to philosophic or speculative validity. But I think it has been shown, in touching upon the way in wlhich the conception of Mind was most probably formed, namely, as a sort of replica of the whole man, that there is something real in the phenomena of conscious life, which at present has no single name, and for which I now add, that we may usefully borrow the name Mind, seeing, or perhaps I should say assaming, that this term has now lost itsY own original and specific meaning. Understanding it, then, in a more general sense, that is, without taking it to imply anything at all as to the intrinsic nature of that to which it is applied, we may now use it to designate the proximate Real Corldition of consciousness, whatever the specific and intrinsic nature of that condition may be, or whatever differences of intrinsic nature it may include and cover. In thus defining the term we set it free from its former specific antagonism to Matter, and at the same time obtain for it a range of applicability which is commensurate with that of consciousness itself. The conception of a Real Condition of consciousness is yielded, independently of the specific conception of Mind, by the phlilosophical analysis of the concrete conscious being. It may also be regarded as a modification of the common-sense conception of Mlind, effected by xitnply dropping out of that conception the assumption of a speci- B2</page><page sequence="20">20 fically immaterial or psychical character in the agent. Thus the only meaning which the term Mind can legitimately retain is drawn from the relation in which it stands to consciousness. And this meaning I think the word may usefully continue to bear, as a single word equivalent to its proposed definition, proximate Real Condition of consciousness. Taken in this general and legitimate sense, the term Mind becomes applicable, not only to the agent which is immediately operative in human consciousness, but also to the infinite and eternal, though to us positively and intrinsically unknown Power, which sustains and serves to actualise consciousness in its whole nature and extent, as neural substance sustains aud actualises consciousness in ourselres, seeinig that the whole meaning of the term is now drawn from the relation which this agent bears to consciousness, and its whole value conceived as reflected back upon it from the consciousness which it sustains. In thinking at all of the infinite and unkr.own universe beyond the range of our positive knowledge, limited as that is by the capacities of our organism, it is impossible to avoid a certain anthro- pomorplhism, though it is of a very different kind from that which I described above as seeing in the universe a man making a world. As human beings, all our thoughts of the unknown must be expressed in terms of human knowledge, in order merely to be intelligible to our own consciousness. From this kind of anthropomorphism in thinking of the unknown it is impossiole for us to escape. Our very concep- tions of Existence, of Reality, of Power, are human conceptions. But the way to deal with this necessity, seeing that we cannot buit be subject to it, is, if I may say so, to render ourselves distinctly aware of it, aware that even our most general terms are drawn from our perceptions of what is within, thoagh applied to realise in thought what is beyond, the positively knowable region. In this way we come to see that there are certain things which we must think con- cerning, that unknown region, and which we hold fast in thought with deeper couviction, the more anxiously we examine and test them, thoughts which thus seem bound up with the very texture aiid mechanism of rational and conscious life. Among these I count the tlhoaught, that in the unknown region there are modes of consciousness better, nobler, more glorious, than any that human thought can realise, though akin to those which human thought calls by names like these, and like them dependent upon the eternal Power. by which the whole universe is sustained.</page></plain_text>
