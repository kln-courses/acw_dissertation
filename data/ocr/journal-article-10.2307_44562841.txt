<plain_text><page sequence="1">670925 A Statistical Analysis of 28,000 Accident Cases with Emphasis on Occupant Restraint Value N. I. Bohlin Passenger Car Engineering Dept., AB Volvo THE VALUE AND EFFECTIVENESS of occupant restraints, especially the upper torso restraint, in car accidents have been discussed and investigated in different ways. The in- vestigations carried out have mainly concerned experimental studies in dynamic sled runs or full-scale car barrier crashes where anthropomorphic dummies have been used. In very few cases a human cadaver has been substituted for the dummy. Further mathematical models and computer programs have been the basis for the evaluation of the restraint value. Most of the investigations, which are based on data from real accidents, are considered to have one or more of the fol- lowing deficiencies of greatest importance for the conclu- sions derived: 1. Insufficient and nonrepresentative number of cases. 2. The "car" involved has meant the smallest European vehicle, as well as the big American one --an uncontrolled parameter. 3. Insufficient consideration to the influence of the vari- ous systems, makes, and installations of belts or harnesses involved. The primary purpose of this statistical analysis is to eval- uate the effectiveness of the three -point upper torso shoulder restraint without the shortcomings mentioned above. It is considered to be a matter of course that findings and ex- periences derived from a representative and extensive num- ber of real accident cases are superior to and more reliable than those of any experimental or theoretical study. To the best of the author's knowledge, the comprehensive investi- gation made is unique in regard to focusing attention on the combination of a specific car and a particular type of belt (Fig. 1). The cars involved throughout the collected mate- rial are of the same make and consist in practice of just two models (the Volvo P-12 and P-ll) with about equal size and weight. The safety belt is the Volvo three -point safety harness. This harness is classified as type 2 in SAE J4c and Federal Register 11528 and has a combined lap and upper torso strap with a so-called slip -joint in conjunction with the buckle, which is attachable to the transmission tunnel without an intermediate short strap (Fig. 1). The fact that Volvo cars, which are not subjected to model or body changes ABSTRACT - ■ - The value of the three -point safety belt has been eval- uated by a statistical analysis of more than 28,000 accident cases, which concerned mainly two cars only and in which 37,511 unbelted and belted front-seat occupants were in- volved. The safety harness concerned is the Volvo three - point combined lap and upper torso harness with a so-called s lip -joint. The average injury -reducing effect of the har- ness proved to vary between 0 and 90 %, depending on the speed at which the accident occurred or the type of injury. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. Slight injuries only, mostly single rib cracks, bruises, etc., caused by the safety belt were reported in some cases. The three - point belt proved to be fully effective against ejection out of the car. Almost all cars involved were equipped with safety belts, of which, however, only 26% on an average were used. The frequency of use increased with the age of the occupants. 2981</page><page sequence="2">2982 N. I. BOHLIN Fig. 1 - The two car models concerned in the analysis. (A), Volvo P-12; (B), Volvo type 2 safety belt; (C), Volvo P-ll too often, have had the type of belt mentioned as standard on the front seats since 1959, created an essential ground of the investigation. METHOD OF COLLECTING DATA The Volvo "five-year guarantee" in Scandinavia made the collecting of data possible. This guarantee means briefly that every Volvo car is guaranteed by the company against damage in case of an accident during the first 5 years after delivery. The repair cost exceeding $80* is free for the car owner and when the car is written off -- normally when the repair cost is calculated to exceed $800 -$1000 --it *A11 monetary figures are in United States dollars. is replaced by the company with a new vehicle . Consequently all accidents in which Volvo cars are involved and the re- pair cost is higher than $80 have to be reported to the com- pany. The investigation was limited to Sweden and during the data collecting period of 1 year from March 28, 1965 to March 28, 1966 the average number of Volvo cars under obligation to report was 297,000 in Sweden. The average total number of Volvo cars on Swedish roads during this period was about 430,000. A questionnaire or report form suitable for computer pro- gramming was to be filled in by the car owner or the driver after an accident. A translated sample of the form is shown in Fig. 2. The form comprises a total of 80 questions deal- ling with road and weather conditions, type of accident, speed, the general and also detailed behavior of the car, the use and type of safety belt, injuries sustained, and in- terior objects producing injury. Most of the questions pro- vided data which were essential for this analysis. The re- turn of the answers requested was not compulsory -- but emphasized by the department involved -- and had nothing to do with the ordinary regulations of the insurance or the financial side of the case. Selected people at the Volvo subdealers, who collected the forms within their dealer dis- tricts, were trained to give advice and instructions about the filling in of the form. The forms were then collected by the company, coded, checked, and finally transferred into punch cards. Severe accidents or other special cases were subjected to detailed investigation, contacts with the police, hospitals, etc. BASIC COLLECTED DATA As a concentrated survey of more than 1 million facts obtained, some basic figures are given: 37,761 accidents (equal to the guarantee cases) were re- ported. In 28,780 of the cases (76%) the requested forms were satisfactorily filled in and recorded. These cases in- volved a total of 42,813 car occupants, consisting of 28,- 780 drivers, 8731 front-seat passengers, and 5302 rear-seat occupants. In 1803 cases (6.3%) 2445 occupants (5.7%) sus- tained injuries, from slight to fatal. Models of cars involved were substantially just two: Volvo Model P-12 in 16,076 cases and Model P-ll in 12,610 cases; only 94 cases concerned the Volvo sports car P-1800. The type of safety belt concerned in the belt cases was the three -point safety harness mentioned to an extent of 8992 in the front seats. In 574 cases only the single diag- onal two -point upper torso belt was used. In three cases other types of belt were involved. The main types of accident found are listed in Table 1. The main accident types only are given. It must, however, be understood that in most cases there was a complex com- bination of two or more of the cited types. The statistical analysis, carried out in cooperation with experts in the field outside the company, was primarily con- centrated to the injuries sustained by the front -seat occu- pants and to the injury -reducing effect of the safety belt.</page><page sequence="3">OCCUPANT RESTRAINT VALUE 2983 INFORMATION liwdo-s) AB "VOLVO AflOUT 1HAFF1C ¿CCIOĒNT 9 ,1845^ Box 382, Göteborg 1 I51 06 11 Noto Th» purpose of the Information is to create a bari« ter th* continuou« development *ork of Increasing interior safety in puMngw cars to prevent injuries Th« information do«* not concern th« insurance company or the investigation mada by the police.

One accident case often means two occupant cases. DEGREE OF SEVERITY OF ACCIDENT - This is considered to be a factor of importance for an adequate evaluation. Adopting the rule of experience that the repair cost of the damaged car as well as the speed at the time of the acci- dent in general have certain correlations with the severity of the accident, these two factors are used as a kind of unit of measure for the accident severity. Accidents with repair cost lower than $80 are not in- cluded. That means that all minor accidents are deleted. The distribution of the number of (occupant) cases along the repair cost scale is given in Fig. 3.

Fig. 4 - Distribution of front-seat occupants in relation to speed (actual numbers in the investigation) senting a repair cost of $200-400 is most frequent. The recorded costs are mainly true costs, but calculated for values above $800-1000 because the damaged vehicle is then con- sidered unrepairable and substituted by a new car. The repair cost is not recorded in a number of cases for different reasons, delayed information, etc. Some inves- tigations concerning the unrecorded repair cost cases have clearly indicated, however, that those cases usually con- cern badly damaged cars with high repair costs. There- fore, it is considered that the curve in Fig. 3 should be somewhat higher in the higher cost region to be repre- sentative . Fig. 4 shows the distribution of front -seat occupants (belted and unbelted) in relation to speed at the moment of the accident. Cases within the speed range of 15-30 mph are significantly dominant in both groups. With due respect for the fact that people, for understandable reasons, are nor- mally disposed to report a lower speed than the true one in an accident, it can be assumed that the curve in question should be transferred to rather higher speeds in general. INJURIES SUSTAINED - The occupants' injuries were marked on the form, by the ear owner (driver). The injuries are divided into three (four) groups: 1. Fatal injuries. 2. Serious injuries. 3. Slight injuries. (4.) No injuries. The accuracy and reliability of this manner of data col- lecting depend on the reporter's judgment and understanding. In the fatal and no injuries cases, the criterium is undoubtedly clear. The "serious injuries" are defined as needing treat- ment in hospital and it was found by checking details of in- juries reported, especially serious ones, that they were mostly obtained from doctors. To avoid the influence of possible errors in the two mid- dle groups of the injury rating, all main conclusions per-</page><page sequence="6">2986 N. I.

In order to provide the possibility of counteracting the error risk mentioned above and to obtain a more reliable and uniform graduation of the resulting injuries, the fol- lowing graduation system was adopted.

Each form covering an injured occupant was carefully studied and the cited injuries were then manually recorded, listed, and referred to as serious or slight in cooperation with a physi- cian. Thus, graduation of injury is used in some parts of the analysis, for example, frequency of main injuries to the occupants and distribution of injuries on the body. All statistical figures are given in numbers per 10,000 unless otherwise specified. (Note: The cars involved have left-hand steering and the accidents occurred in left-hand traffic.) Table 2 shows the number of injuries sustained by the drivers and front -seat passengers. It is both misleading and inadequate to derive more than preliminary conclusions about the value of the safety belt from these average survey figures. The frequency of injury, as well as the degree of its severity, must be related to the speed at which the acci- dent occurred, which could be considered as a relevant mea- sure of the severity of the accident. The frequency of injuries related to accident speed is graphically shown in Figs. 5 and 6. For reasons previously mentioned, the injuries here are divided into two classes only: fatal and nonfatal equaling all injuries from slight to very serious ones. The number of injuries increases overall rapidly at increasing speed. The frequency at 50 mph is about 2.5 times the frequency at 30 mph for the driver (about</page><page sequence="7">OCCUPANT RESTRAINT VALUE 2987 Injury-reducing effect V//X Unbelted HB Belted of belt in per cent t|.

The unbelted front -seat passenger sustained injuries more often than the unbelted driver, as much as 50 % more at 30 mph, about 22% more at 60 mph. The fatal injuries occurred in the belted cases at acci- dent speeds exceeding 60 mph. The fatalities in the un- belted cases were spread over the whole speed scale, starting as low as 12 mph. The injury-reducing rate of the belt is calculated at vari- ous speeds (Figs. 5 and 6). With regard to nonfatal injuries, the reducing rate in per cent of the driver's belt varies from about 57% at lower speeds to 48% at higher speeds. The front -seat passenger's belt shows somewhat higher rates (63 to 55%, respectively). Considering the fatal injuries, the bold conclusion can be derived that the safety belt offers "full" protection against fatal injury up to accident speeds of about 60 mph. The types of frequent injuries sustained by the occupants were derived and analyzed from each report form, as pre- viously mentioned. A graphical survey, which tells the fre- quency of specific injuries sustained by the unbelted driver as well as his belted colleague, is presented in Fig. 7. Corre- sponding figures for the front-seat passenger are in Fig. 8. Again, the unbelted front -seat passenger is substantially more subject to injuries in relation to the driver.

The increased frequency of leg injuries is proved too. No remarkable corre- sponding difference between the belted driver and the belted passenger can be pointed out. The unbelted driver's lower injury rate related to the passenger's might be referred to the steering wheel, which offers some "support" at lower speeds. Again, the value of the safety belt in decreasing the injury rate is high. The reduction per cent with respect to the specified injuries is included in the survey as another adequate value rating of the safety belt. It is to be especially noted that the reduction percentage is particularly high in the case of fatal and serious injuries. Further, the number of head and thorax injuries are reduced by 60-85% when the belt is used. "Single rib fracture" injury has, however, a comparatively low reduction per cent (28% for front -seat passenger). This will be discussed further in the following paragraphs. The injury reduction percentage of the passen- ger's belt is generally much higher than that of the driver's belt. This advantage for the passenger tan certainly be referred to the greater clearance between him and the parts of the car in front of him. In quite a number of the belt cases, it was recorded that the belt was worn too loosely, which has contributed to de- creased effectiveness of the belt. Injuries sustained when belts were used, therefore, could be referred partly to such factors. There are good grounds for assuming that the injury reduction value of the belt would have become still higher if the belts had been worn snugly or better adjusted through- out. As a matter of fact, in some belt cases the belt was apparently so poorly adjusted that it would be more accurate to consider them as unbelted cases. Injuries caused by the safety belt were reported in 34 cases for drivers and in 25 cases for the front-seat passenger.

In view of the additional in- formation in some of these cases that the belt was not prop- erly tightened, it could be assumed that some of those in- juries were caused not by the pressure of the belt, but by impact against the steering wheel due to decreased effec- tive restraint of the belt. Slight single rib fracture was found to be the most frequent injury to both the driver and his passenger caused by the belts. These injuries did not, how- ever, need hospitalization. Collar bone fracture occurred on the shoulder strap side. No cervical vertebrae injuries caused by the belt were reported. Most injuries reported to be caused by the belt occurred in conjunction with seriously injured unbelted occupants and in accidents at high speeds. The distribution of injuries on the occupant's body is illustrated in Fig. 9 (driver) and Fig. 10 (front-seat passen- ger). Skull and head injuries dominate, but were effectively counteracted by the safety belt. Ejection of front -seat occupants out of the car happened in 159 unbelted cases, and possibly in one single belt case. Ejection of unbelted occupants was reported in conjunction with fatal injuries in 10 cases out of a total of 49 fatal cases and serious injuries in 59 cases out of a total of 423 cases. In most cases, it was not possible to obtain positive con- firmation that the ejection had caused the fatal and serious injuries. In 3 of the 10 fatal cases, however, it could be determined for good reasons that ejection was the primary cause. Even with this cautious derivation of cause, the risk of fatal injury increases more than 10 times in the case of ejection compared to nonejection. In one single belt case, partial ejection might have oc- curred. Unfortunately, the investigation in question did not definitely clarify what really happened. The driver, with his small children 3 and 7 years old in the rear seat, could not positively recognize how he was positioned or when and how he released his belt at the moment after the accident, which was a severe roll -over at 50 mph. He thought he had been partly outside the car and reported accordingly on the form. The man sustained moderate to serious injuries to pelvis and leg and also fracture of the arm. ANALYSIS OF CASES WITH TWO FRONT -SEAT OCCUPANTS To analyze the injury -reducing effect in more detail and with other aspects the investigation material was separated into the following four groups (passenger means front -seat passenger and the belt is the three -point shoulder harness): 1. Unbelted driver in relation to unbelted passenger. 2. Belted driver in relation to belted passenger. 3. Unbelted driver in relation to belted passenger. 4. Belted driver in relation to unbelted passenger. The analysis of the combinations cited concerns all cases with occupants in both the front seats at least. The distribution of the actual number of cases among the groups mentioned was: Group 1 -- 6106 cases (67.6%). Group 2 -- 2413 cases (26.6%). Group 3 -- 275 cases (3.1%). Group 4 -- 245 cases (2.7%). Total - 9039 cases It is to be noted that the first two groups (both driver and front -seat passenger are equally "equipped" -- either belted or unbelted) represent the most substantial part of the material. The explanation might be that the driver's</page><page sequence="10">2990 N. I.

"opinion" or habit to be belted or un- belted strongly influences his front-seat passenger. The distribution of injuries in Groups 1 and 2 is shown in Table 4. It is concluded that the passenger's seat, in general, is more exposed to injury -producing conditions than the driver's seat. In adding the numbers of all injur- ies from fatal to slight, one gets an average relation factor for Group 1 of 1.4 (555/395) and for Group 2 of 1.44. From this relation factor one might be inclined to con- clude that the belt in that respect does not have any favor- able effect. The influence of speed, however, must be con- sidered. Limited studies pertaining to the influence of speed indicate that the "belted passenger's seat" from an injury- producing point of view is significantly more exposed than the "belted driver's seat" at low and moderate speeds, but less exposed at higher speeds (Fig. 14). One explanation for this could be that the driver has some advantage from the steering wheel in moderate -speed accidents, but in high- speed impacts, when the (front of the) car generally is badly damaged and the steering wheel is often displaced rear- wards, the clearance to vehicle structure is insufficient to give the driver's belt full effectiveness. The 15 drivers killed in relation to (only) 10 passengers killed in Group 1 might seem to be somewhat controversial in view of the "relation factor" mentioned above. However, these 15 fatal cases included 4 cases of door opening with subsequent ejection (1 case only for passenger's seat) and 1 Table 5 - Distribution of Injuries of Front-Seat Occupants, Groups 3 and 4 (Note: Numbers of injuries are too small to justify a significant classification) Classification No. Group of Injury Injured 3 Unbelted Driver Injured, total 34 Uninjured 241 Belted Passenger Injured, total 28 Uninjured 247 4 Belted Driver Note: See 2 Injured, total 17 Uninjured 228 Unbelted Passenger Injured, total 26 Uninjured 219 case where the driver was just moderately injured in the ac- cident (one of his legs was broken) but due to an uncommon sequel he died a few days later in hospital. To find the average injury -reducing effect of the shoul- der belt (in addition to the basic figures in the main report) groups 1 and 2 were compared, and the effect mentioned was found to be for Driver's seat -- 54 fy Passenger's seat -- 52 °lo Table 5 shows the distribution of injuries in Groups 3 and 4. In these groups the total number of cases as well as the injury cases is considered too small to permit more than general conclusions. The figures on an average clearly in- dicate, however, the positive effect of the belt. To provide further information about the accident history, each of the 62 injury cases in Group 3 and all of the 43 cases in Group 4 were studied in detail from the accident forms. The following was revealed. GROUP 3 - In the only fatal cases recorded, the unbelted driver sustained fatal injuries to the chest and head when thrown against the steering wheel and the header above the windshield in a head-on collision at a speed of about 50 mph. The belted passenger sustained no injuries. One un- belted passenger in the rear seat was seriously injured. The Group 3 material comprised 14 further cases of fron- tal impact in which the unbelted drivers were seriously in- jured in 6 cases, whereas the belted passengers were seriously injured in only 2 cases. The driver's door opened in 7 cases in which 2 unbelted drivers were ejected out of the vehicle and thereby seriously</page><page sequence="11">OCCUPANT RESTRAINT VALUE 2991 injured. Hie passenger's door opened in five cases, but there was no ejection of the belted passenger. Side impacts and other types of untypical frontal acci- dents happened in a total of 16 cases. Rear-end impact oc- curred in two cases. GROUP 4 - Details from the two fatal accidents recorded in Group 4 can be reported in one case. There was a fron- tal impact at about 30 mph where the belted driver sus- tained a slight cut (broken glass) on his head, whereas the unbelted front -seat passenger was fatally injured (damaged kidney, broken pelvis). One occupant centrally located in the rear seat was uninjured. The accident types included 15 frontal impacts, 4 side impacts (of which the driver's side was hit in 3 cases), and 3 rear-end impacts. In 11 out of the 15 frontal impacts the belted driver was less injured than the unbelted passenger. In three cases the reported degree was equal (slight for both the occupants) and in one case the driver sustained slight injury, whereas the passenger was uninjured. That single case concerned an accident where the vehicle was hit in the front end, about 30 deg to the left, at a speed of about 25 mph. The driver sustained slight bruises on his nose and his knee. Door opening occurred in four cases (in side impacts and roll -overs) on the passenger's side causing the ejection of one unbelted passenger, who was seriously injured on his head and his back. Driver's door opened in two cases, but there was no ejection of the belted driver. UNBELTED REAR-SEAT PASSENGER IN RELATION TO SHOULDER-BELTED FRONT -SEAT OCCUPANT IN FRONTAL IMPACTS This part of the analysis concerns the possible chances that an unbelted rear -seat passenger in a frontal impact is thrown forward against the shoulder -belted occupant in front of him, thereby causing injuries (head against head) to either of the "colliding" occupants. In the 28,780 accident cases there were 5039 rear -seat passengers involved, of whom 2178 were involved in frontal impact accidents. Only three of those rear -seat passengers were belted and none were injured. The type of belt was the single diagonal shoulder belt. The unbelted 2175 rear- seat occupants were positioned in the car as follows: Rear right (behind the front -seat passenger) 1043 Rear left (behind the driver) 747 Rear middle 385 Injuries sustained by the rear-seat occupants (2175) in frontal impacts are shown in Table 6. The number of cases to be further studied to answer the question mentioned above is thus: 52 + 35 + 23 = 110, where injuries of all degrees were sustained, of which 43 were fatal or serious injuries. The criterium of the cases to be finally concerned was settled to be the combination of the following four condi- tions: 1. Frontal or mainly frontal impact.

Either driver or front-seat passenger, or both, belted. 3. At least one rear -seat occupant belted or unbelted. 4. Either the belted front -seat occupant or the rear -seat occupant, or both, more than slightly injured. It is considered to be reasonable to exclude the "slight injury" cases (that is, no hospital treatment) because a pos- sible head -to -head collision would certainly have more serious consequences. Eleven cases complied with the earlier conditions men- tioned. Each of these is reported in more detail below: 1. Speed about 60 mph, impact against another vehicle. The belted front -seat occupant sustained some forehead injuries (side door structure) and fracture of one of his feet. The unbelted right rear -seat passenger sustained fracture to his jawbone when thrown against the upper part of the front seat. 2. Speed about 50 mph, impact against a truck. Belted front -seat occupant sustained no injuries, whereas the un- belted rear -seat passenger sustained a skull fracture when striking the roof structure. 3. (Frontal) impact followed by rear-end impact. Speed not reported. The belted driver was not injured, the un- restrained rear-seat occupant sustained slight -to -moderate injuries to face when hitting front-seat structure. 4. Impact against another vehicle at a speed of 37 mph. The belted driver sustained rib fracture. One of the two unbelted occupants in rear seat was seriously injured on his right leg, and the other slightly injured from upper part of front seat. 5. Mainly frontal impact (slightly from the right) against a bulldozer at a speed of about 25 mph. The two belted occupants of the front seats sustained slight undefined in-</page><page sequence="12">2992 N. I. BOHLIN juries, the single rear -seat occupant sustained a broken arm when thrown against the seat and door structure. 6. (Frontal) impact followed by roll -over at a speed of more than 60 mph. The vehicle was completely wrecked. The belted driver as well as the belted passenger in the front seat sustained fracture of collar bone and rib fracture. The single rear -seat occupant behind the right front seat was seriously injured in the back and sustained fractures of verte- brae. He was thrown out of the vehicle through the rear win- dow at the third roll -over which followed the impact. 7. Impact against another vehicle, speed about 25 mph. Belted driver sustained single rib fracture, belted passenger was uninjured. The unbelted and left positioned rear-seat occupant smashed his lips and teeth against front -seat struc- ture. 8. Impact against an elk at a speed of 50 mph. The belted driver sustained rib fracture by striking the steering wheel in spite of the belt, cuts from glass on his right hand. The belted passenger next to him sustained slight cuts on his hands from glass. One of the two unbelted rear-seat occupants sustained a broken nose and cut on lower part of jaw from seat structure. The other had slight, but undefined injuries. 9. Impact against a car, speed 25 mph. Belted driver sustained slight injuries, and his belted passenger sustained cuts on face from glass and fracture of his right lower arm. The occupants in the rear seats were both slightly to mod- erately injured (cuts on the legs and soreness in abdominal area). 10. In this accident the driver fell asleep and the vehicle impacted a tree at a speed of more than 60 mph. The car was wrecked. The belted driver was killed due to smashed thorax and skull fracture. The driver's seat was torn loose and the belt webbing burst, probably caused by the impact created by the unbelted rear -seat occupant, when he was thrown forward against the driver's seat. At the moment of the accident he was lying asleep in the rear seat. The pas- senger sustained mainly just a leg fracture. 11. Impact against a passenger car, speed above 60 mph followed by roll -over and side impact. Both the driver and the front -seat passenger were belted. Driver seriously in- jured: rib fracture, moderate concussion, and contusion to one of his thighs. Front passenger sustained fatal skull frac- ture when he was thrown against the door structure. The single rear -seat passenger positioned to the right sustained no head injuries, but serious injuries to thorax and fracture of thigh bone. With respect to the comparatively high number of cases of the total material analyzed, it might be concluded with good reason that: The risk of a "collision" between the head of the shoulder belted front- seat occupant and the head of the rear-seat occupant is minor. Anyhow, the occurrence of that risk is not confirmed by the analysis. USE OF SAFETY BELT More than 98% of the cars involved in the reported acci- dents were equipped with safety belts on the front seats. Safety belt 7.

Fig. 11 - Use of seat belt in relation to accident speed That means that almost every driver and front -seat passen- ger had the chance to be restrained. The analysis revealed, however, that the safety belts were used on an average only by about 25% (6870) drivers and by about 30% (2699) of the front-seat passengers. As shown in Fig. 11, the "use per cent" is found to increase, however, at increasing accident speed. Is the driver who fastens his belt a high-speed traveler, or do people prefer to be belted during (longer) trips which result in higher speeds? The use per cent of the front -seat passenger increases gradually with the speed, whereas that of the driver rises significantly steeply at 30 mph. The explanation for this could be that in Sweden the speed limit in city areas is generally 30 mph. Do longer trips in unrestricted areas mean more belt users? This theory is party supported by the answers given by the occupants to the question: "When do you use your safety belt?" The answers were: Always - 19% During long trips only - 60% Seldom or never - 18% No answer - 3% The analysis of the age of the driver involved in accidents revealed that the very young drivers, age 18-24 years, made up the substantial part (Fig. 12). The number of 20 year old drivers who are involved in accidents is three times as high as the number of 45 year old drivers. The young driver is also a lazy belt user. The 20 year old driver uses the belt in no more than about 16% of the cases, whereas the 45 year old driver uses it in 30% of the cases. Objects in the car interior causing injury were recorded and have been analyzed with respect to the driver (Fig. 13). The collected data did not, however, make such an analysis for the passenger possible without certain error risks, and that part had to be consequently deleted. The steering wheel and column and the windshield are the objects producing most injury to the driver. The lower part of the dashboard is next on the list.

BOHLIN SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS From the analysis carried out, it is concluded that the three -point combined lap and diagonal shoulder harness with slip -joint: 1. Reduces substantially the frequency of injury of all kinds and the frequency of certain injuries (particularly con- cerning the head and upper torso) very substantially. 2. Offers effective protection against ejection. 3. Does not cause any serious injury to the wearer, but in some severe accidents slight injuries such as cracks in single rib, bruises, etc. To improve the effect of the safety belt even more, it is strongly considered that particular emphasis should be given to factors which will contribute to more frequent use of the belt and to easier adjustment of the belt.
