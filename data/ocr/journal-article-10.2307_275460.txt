<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK IN SOUTH AMERICA, 1934 TO 1936 WENDELL C. BENNETT182 TWO YEARS ago Lothrop (1934)183 published a summary of arch- aeological work in South America covering the years 1931-1934. This article continues the summary up to 1936. Relatively few archaeo- logical expeditions have come to my attention in this period and con- sequently the review is based largely on published accounts. Such field reports as are available are incorporated under the proper sections. Thompson (1936) has published a guide leaflet on the archaeology of South America, reviewing the various fields included. Other publica- tions refer more specifically to single sections. The review of sections starts in the Andean region, and continues with the eastern South American countries. COLOMBIA Mason (1936) has added a second part to his series on the Tairona Culture of Santa Marta which incorporates detailed descriptions and photographs of the bone, shell, stone and metal artifacts. Lunardi (1934, 1934a, 1934b, 1935, 1936) has a series of articles on Colombian archaeology, dealing specifically with the stone carving of San Augus- tin, and comparisons. The first four papers listed are in rather inacces- sible journals. The last paper is on the identification of animals repre- sented in the stone carving. Thompson (1936) in his chapter on Co- lombia discusses that country as a possible center of distribution of various traits to Central America. He stresses the importance of arch- aeological work in Colombia, which has been badly neglected. ECUADOR Uhle (1936) sums up his years of archaeological investigation in Ecuador in a short paper which emphasizes the constant influence of the Maya civilization. He cites Esmeraldas in particular for the visible influence of Central America in figurine modeling and design. In this connection a fine collection of Esmeraldas material has been collected and brought to this country by Dr. Ernesto Franco, whose publication New art from Esmeraldas is soon to be issued by the Delphic Studio of New York. Finally, Gillin (1936) gives a brief description of an urn col- 182 Assistant Curator of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History, New York City. 183 See bibliography at end of article, 248</page><page sequence="2">BENNETT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK IN SOUTH AMERICA lected by him from the Rio Aguarico'region, eastern Ecuador, which, although unique in ways, is stylistically similar to urns from the Rio Napo region (eastern Ecuador) and the island of Maraj6 (Brazil). PERU An archaeological bibliography (Schwab, 1936) and Valcarcel's (1936) summary of work done in 1934-1935 are about the only general references to Peru as a whole which have come to my attention. Other work can be better classified in reference to regional subdivisions of Peru. Far North Coast. My 1936 Peruvian field work included two months' work in the Lambayeque valley. Twenty-five sites were examined and three were selected for more intensive excavation. This resulted in a collection of 236 complete or restorable bowls and considerable sherd material, copper, beads and other artifacts. Nothing pertaining to or contemporaneous with the Early Chimu civilization to the south was encountered, which concurs with the results of Kroeber, Olson and others who have worked in this section. One private collection in Chiclayo contained several pieces of a related Early Chimu style, how- ever, which suggests contacts with the south, perhaps in a Middle Chimu period. Kroeber's "cursive" style, which is classed as a Middle period to the south, was found associated with Late Chimu blackware in my excavations in Lambayeque. The collection is now being examined in preparation for a publication next year. North Coast. Four months of my field work consisted of concentrated excavation in Virui valley and minor work in Moche and Chicama valleys. Near Virui Pueblo I excavated twenty trenches in an Early Chimu dwelling site with intrusive burials of Red-white-black and Late Chimu types. One Early Chimu burial was found at this site at two to three meters depth, with skeleton and pottery in a large urn. Two graves showed the association of Red-white-black and Late Chimu blackware. At Carmelo, near the mouth of Virui valley, I excavated in a large pyramid with habitation sites on the platforms which yielded a new type of pottery for the Peru coast. Nearby was a small cemetery of the same civilization which furnished over 100 complete or restorable bowls. Negative painted design is characteristic of this pottery. Several associated forms show influence or contact with the Early Chimu period (such as stirrup spouts, and conical-handled measuring bowls). Other shapes suggest highland influence from the general section of the Callej6n de Huaylas (Recuay), which is also the center of negative painting. I believe that the analysis of the grave and sherd material 249</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY will place this Carmelo site following the Early Chimu period and before the Tiahuanaco-influenced Middle periods, or, in other words, a Middle Chimu such as Kroeber suggested. Rafael Larco Hoyle continues his archaeological work in the north coast region, principally in Chicama valley. His private museum at Chiclin has now one of the finest Early Chimu collections in the world. He is particularly interested in the Chavin-style designed pottery found in this region. In a dry quebrada off Chicama valley he has discovered the site of Cupisnique which has hundreds of fragments of the Chavin- style pottery strewn about the surface. He advocates the use of the site name "Cupisnique," rather than the style name, "Chavin," to designate this ware. So far. he has not established the chronological position of Cupisnique in reference to the Chimu periods. While Larco publishes articles in the local press, his work will not be appreciated until the book which he is preparing on the Early Chimu period is issued. Langlois (1936) gives a description of a pyramid at Ascope, Chicama valley, which he visited on his trip in 1933. Other papers on the North Coast deal with an analysis of Early Chimu design (Muelle, 1936), de- ductions from these designs in reference to reduced heads, blow guns and bird raising (d'Harcourt and Nique, 1934), and Early Chimu anthropomorphic pottery (Tuya, 1936). Central and South Coasts. Little new work has been done in the Rimac and Nazca sections. Only one reference is at hand: a paper by Doering (1936) on old Peruvian house posts and a Melanesian parallel. Far North Highlands, North Highlands. Langlois (1935) describes remains in the immediate vicinity of Cajamarca, famous meeting place of Pizarro and Atahualpa. Otherwise little has been done recently in this archaeologically unknown section. Nor am I acquainted with fur- ther work in the North Highlands. Central IHighlands. The Peruvian government continued in 1935 its excavations, restoration, clearing and road-building around Cuzco, in- stigated by the 400th anniversary of the conquest of Peru. As many as 1200 workers were employed at times under the general supervision of Dr. Luis E. Valcarcel, who has published three summary articles of the work (1934a, 1934b, 1935). The Instituto Arqueologico del Cuzco was founded in Cuzco. The walls of Ajllawasi, the House of the Sun, Korikancha, Kollkampata and Chokechaka were restored. Archaeologi- cal work was concentrated in nine places, which I list below together with references to special published accounts. (I follow Valc6rcel's spelling of proper names for the Cuzco region.) 250 [4, 1937</page><page sequence="4">BENNETT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK IN SOUTH AMERICA 1. Sajsawaman (Valcarcel, 1934, 1935b) 2.

Greslebin, who paid a visit to Peru in 1935, has written a short note (1934) on the aryballoid Inca pottery. A fragment of one typical aryballoid in the Cuzco museum was examined by Buck (1935) who was impressed by its obvious Tiahuanaco design and suggested that this was a proof of Tiahuanaco's contemporaneity with the Incas. Means (1935a) wrote an effective answer to this argument. South Highlands. Both Tello and Valcarcel visited the site of Pukara, near Juliaca, and made surface sherd collections. Valc6rcel (1935a) published pictures of some of these sherds as well as of statues seen at the same site. Pukara is of considerable importance in highland archae- ology, since some of the statuary is of Classic Tiahuanaco type and some is quite localized. The pottery has Tiahuanaco-style designs but outlined with incisions. The colors, typically yellow-on-red, and the shapes, straight-sided, flat-bottomed, open bowls, suggest a combina- tion of Chiripa yellow-on-red style (Bolivia) and Tiahuanaco. Three Peruvians, Vazquez, Carpio, and Velazco (1935) visited and described the ruins of Tanka-Tanka in the South Highlands. This ap- pears to be an Inca site. Valcarcel and Suarez (1934) exchanged letters in reference to the ruins of Churaj6n near Arequipa. Virtually nothing is known of the archaeology of this Arequipa section, obviously of importance in tracing Tiahuanaco distribution. Peruvian Arts and Customs. Before leaving Peru, I will note briefly a few specialized articles which treat of Peruviana. Murdock (1934) contributes a splendid article on the Inca society, which is repeated in his general book on anthropology (1934a). Alvarado (1934) writes of Quechua society as it persists in Bolivia, and d'Harcourt (1935) describes fertility rites in ancient Peru. Herrera, a Peruvian botanist, has two articles on ethnobotany (1934, 1934a) and, together with Yacovleff, has written two articles 251</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY identifying plants represented in modeling and design on ancient Peru- vian pottery (Yacovleff and Herrera, 1934, 1935). Means (1934) comments on the coast architecture, and Langlois (1936a) analyzed an Early Chimu vessel from Viru valley which repre- sents a compact fortress. Langlois deduces the outline of the fortress by projecting the elements represented on the pot into a proportioned plan. In reference to textiles, O'Neale has published three articles (1934, 1935, 1936), the first on "needleknitting," and the last on wide-loom fabrics of Early Nazca period. In the Kroeber collections, from Cahua- chi, she has found a textile 6' 8" long and 5' 5" wide which, although in fragments, has without doubt been woven onr one loom. This modifies the old idea that textiles were only woven on girdle-back looms of about thirty-inch width. She suggests as explanation either that several women worked simultaneously with girdle-back looms, or that the wide frame loom was known, although so far no remains of it have been found. Yacovleff and Muelle (1934), in describing a Paracas mummy bundle, also mention a wide textile which was not loom-joined. Fester and Cruellas (1934) comment on the pigments of Paracas, and Yacov- leff and Muelle (1934a) add a note to this. Singer (1936) writes about the techniques of Peruvian hairnets, and Wardle (1936) writes about Inca belts and girdles. Bennett (1935a) has a general paper on Peruvian textiles. Doering (1936a) has written the text for a new edition of Lehmann's The Art of Old Peru. BOLIVIA An article and a report (Bennett 1934a, 1936) have appeared on my 1934 excavation in Bolivia. Lothrop included the main results of this excavation in his 1934 summary, but the publications have been issued since. CHILE North Chile. Latcham (1936, 1936a) reports briefly on a trip to the Atacamefio region around Calama which he made in 1935. In the cen- tral Rio Loa region he excavated twenty-six graves of Tiahuanaco type, and at San Pedro de Atacama he found debris of a similar ceme- tery. Although no buildings could be positively associated with this period, it is well defined by pottery, flexed burials, Tiahuanaco-de- signed snuffing tubes and mixing palettes, and the absence of bronze. His sequence of periods runs from this Tiahuanaco period through Atacameiio and Chincha-Atacamefio to Inca. 252 [4, 1937</page><page sequence="6">BENNETT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK IN SOUTH AMERICA South Chile (Tierra del Fuego). Junius Bird has continued his work in the southern archipelago of Chile, and in the Tierra del Fuego region around Magallanes. While much of the territory.surveyed has resulted in negative data, he has found many sites, particularly in 1936, which give new distributions to the flint cultures of Navarin Island and Beagle Channel. In dry caves formed by lava outcrops at Cafiad6n Leona, Laguna Blanca, and at Pale Aike, just south of the Argentine border, he has excavated stratified series of stone scrapers, knives, bolas and other artifacts. The predominance of bolas over bow and arrow remains in the older levels is contrary to previous sequences. Careful determi- nation of beach lines on this rising coast, and calculation of the rate of accumulation of wind blown deposits are serving Bird for new esti- mates of time chronologies which will undoubtedly prove of great interest in the final analysis of these simple cultures. ARGENTINE REPUBLIC Patagonia. Vignati (1934) publishes the results of a La Plata Museum excursion to the Rio Santa Cruz region in 1929-30. Stone-marked tombs (tchenque) were found with extended burials at about 1.50 meters depth. A description of artifacts is given. Greslebin (1935) adds another article to his previous series on the decorated stone plaques of Patagonia, and Elvins (1936) has a note on stone implements from coast shell heaps recently presented to the British Museum. San Juan. Vignati (1934a) describes the cloth and artifacts found with a mummy at Angualasto. Northwest Argentine. The distribution of an anthropomorphized frog design (batrachomorphic) in Catamarca, Tucuman and Salta provinces is the subject of a short paper by Marquez Miranda (1934b). Another of his articles (1934c) deals with the description and comparison of a four-note stone panpipe from Pueblo Viejo, Jujuy province. Still an- other article (1934a) describes the ruins and the bronze and stone arti- facts at a fortress near Colanzuli, Salta province. Casanova has pub- lished two papers, one (1934) on the fortress of Huichairas, Jujuy province, and the other (1934a) on the archaeology of Coctaca, Jujuy province. Santiago del Estero. The Wagner brothers have published an article (1934) and a monograph (1934a) on their excavations which resulted in the discovery of the Chaco-Santiaguefa civilization. Greslebin (1934) and Serrano (1935) have written articles about the Wagners' discovery. The Wagners' monograph is an elaborate volume of 548 quarto pages, 253</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY with 3 plans, 732 text figures, and 106 full page plates, 45 of which are in color. It gives a superb descriptive and graphic account of their finds. The sites are composed of series of somewhat oriented mounds and pools, probably village sites, and cemeteries. A painted pottery group and an incised and modeled group have been isolated, although both are considered contemporaneous by Serrano who also notes that glass beads have been found. The Chaco-Santiaguefa type seems to be a locally developed branch of the Northwest Argentine Diaguite or Calchaqui, in spite of the Wagners' search for world comparisons. Buenos Aires. Three articles deal with the archaeology in Buenos Aires province: the first, Vignati (1936), treats the island of Martin Garcia; the second, Marquez Miranda (1934), treats the Laguna de Lobos; and the final one, Teisseire (1934) covers the left branch of the La Plata River. Santa Fe. Vignati (1934b) gives a detailed anthropometric account of a skeleton found at Esperanza. The geological evidence of its an- tiquity is uncertain. Outes (1935) announced the discovery of elabo- rately modeled pottery near the city of Santa Fe. PARAGUAY Linne (1936) describes an urn from Paraguay decorated with finger scallops (corrugated) and discusses the distribution of the type in a short paper. URUGUAY Fontana Company (1936) has prepared a detailed description of a decorated clay pipe with a thorough discussion of the distributions. Serrano (1936) has published a monograph on the ethnography of Uruguay, in which he incorporates his extensive archaeological obser- vations. BRAZIL An introduction to the archaeology of Brazil by Costa (1934), an article on the pre-Columbian cultures of the Amazon by Mordini (1934), and a review of the work of Dr. Lund by Mattos (1935) are the only references at hand to recent work in Brazil. VENEZUELA Nomland (1935) has continued her work on Venezuela archaeology with this paper on new sites from the state of Falc6n. In this paper I have summarized the recent archaeological work in South America by utilizing the published articles which have come to 254 [4, 1937</page><page sequence="8">BENNETT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK IN SOUTH AMERICA my attention. Obviously I must have overlooked many important con- tributions. I would appreciate any information on articles omitted, so that I may incorporate them in subsequent supplements.
