<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON THE DATED STATUES OF THE NORTHERN WEI DYNASTY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF BUDDHIST SCULPTURE IN CHINA By BENJAMIN ROWLAND, Jr. HE dream of Emperor Ming of the statue of a golden man in the land to the west of Han and the dramatic legend of the subsequent importation of this image, although it belongs to the apocrypha of Chinese Buddhism, may be taken as symbolic of the bringing of statues from India to serve as models for the Buddhist artists of China.' This event is reputed to have taken place in 66 A. D. More reliable tradition places the first introduction of Buddhist images in the second century A. D.' As will be seen from the literary sources and from the actual fragments that have survived centuries of burning and purposeful destruction, the making of Buddhist images in China probably did not become general until the fourth century, until, in conjunction with the rising power of Buddhism in the fifth century, it reached such alarming proportions as to arouse the suspicions of the Taoist clergy who loosed the storm of persecution and iconoclasm under Emperor Wu.3 The religion of Sakyamuni and the art of the Buddhist church reached its first great period of florescence in China under the Northern Liang and Wei Tartar dynasties. Our principal documentary source for the history of Buddhism in China, the Wei sku, states, "In the province of Liang, the descendants of Chang Kuei had faith in Buddhism. The land of Tun Huang from its contacts with the religious and laity of the western countries obtained from them prototypes (for stupas, Buddha images, etc. ?) and the villages, all alike, had many stupas and monasteries."" In this statement we may find one of the first confirmations of such borrowings from the west. Later, with the conquest of the Liang country in 439 A. D., some 39,000 families were moved from the Tun Huang oasis to the Wei capital at Ta-t'ung fu; with this multitude came Buddhist monks and painters and carvers of holy images.5 It has even been suggested that the first rock-cut Buddhas at Ytin Kang were fashioned by artists from the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.6 The present article will be restricted to an examination of the specifically dated sculpture in this formative period in the fourth century under the Northern Wei dynasty. An attempt will be made to study the influences that determined the character of this earliest Chinese Buddhist sculpture. I. H.

As an appendix I submit a list which, in no way pretending to completeness, is intended as a framework for other students to add to, in the interests of forming a useful corpus of Chinese sculpture. With our ignorance of the great body of dated statues in the collections of the East and West, it will be possible to give only a skeleton list of the known dated works that fall within the period of this study. For the sake of completeness I have included the examples of sculpture from the Southern dynasties which will not be discussed in this article.' Almost all of the statues we shall consider show an ultimate derivation from the sculpture of Mathura or Gandhara and, in general, may be said to belong to the so-called " Udayana" type from the famous image of the king of Kaucambi; judging from the copies of this work at Seiryoji (Kyoto), Anyoji, etc., the original-probably of the late Gandhara school-represented Sakyamuni with the robe over both shoulders and disposed in a schematized derivation from the rippling drapery of the Hellenistic draped figures.9 An examination of any typical Gandhara image (Fig. i) will show an arrangement of the robe with the folds radiating from the left armpit and flowing across the body in a scheme analogous to the disposition of the gown of the Sophocles of the Lateran. It would be impossible to examine in detail the origins and development of the Gandhara or Graeco-Buddhist school. However, to make perfectly clear my use of these terms it will be useful to summarize very briefly the history of this puzzling art that is generally regarded as the one cultural legacy of Alexander and his successors in India. More and more it seems certain that Foucher, Bachhofer, and other critics in favor of an early dating of this hybrid style have made the mistake of considering it as an isolated phenomenon quite apart from the general current of Indian art; in the matter of chronology they have further neglected the testimony of the Chinese sources, since the first mentions of the importation of Buddha images would seem to provide a terminus ante quem for the manufacture of such anthropomorphic represent- ations in India. The few pieces of Graeco-Buddhist sculpture dated in vague eras only confuse the issue, and we must perforce rely on the chronology of the masonry at Taxila, on coin finds, and on the convincing chronology of terra-cotta fragments by Major Gordon,'o all of which evidence leads to the conclusion that no single piece of Gandhara sculpture can be dated earlier than the late first century A. D. I have come to the conclusion that probably not only the remains in Turkestan but also the larger part of the sculpture of Gandhara and Afghanistan is almost exactly contemporary 7.

D., the Gandhara ateliers were still flourishing in the fourth and fifth centuries of our era. In the earliest sculpture of Northwestern India (Gandhara), that is, from about the year Ioo A. D., we find an incised drapery technique not markedly different from that of the ancient national schools of India as represented by the sculptures of Bharhut and Sanchi." Undoubtedly these first artists to carve the recalcitrant blue schist of the Swat Valley were already feeling the influence of the schools of the Roman orient, an influence that very soon produced the deeply undercut, heavy drapery that marks the statues of the florescence of the school in the second and third centuries of the Christian era."2 It is this type of Gandhara sculpture with its strongly classical feeling that has earned it the misnomer of Graeco Buddhist. Later, and contemporary with the renaissance in stucco decoration at Hadda and Taxila, there is, particularly in the stone sculpture, a return to Indian models with special emphasis on the transparency of the robe. The folds tend to take on the sharp, ridge-like schematization as in the sculpture of Palmyra and Dura Europas." It is rather questionable whether in these late Gandhara statues the drapery is actually thought of as transparent, in the sense, for instance, of the sculptures of the Nereid monument, or whether the Oriental tendency towards surface decoration has simply taken the folds of the garment as a basis for a superficial pattern of lines on the surface of the body and as part of the same volume. It may be regarded as a compromise between the heavily enveloping robe of the Hellenistic type and the essential and beautiful nudity of the Indian cult image. In the ateliers of Mathura, the scheme of folds in the robe of the Buddha, although obviously derived from the statues of northern India, sometimes differs in that the folds radiate concentrically on the median line of the statue. The folds themselves are reduced to a series of round strings so that the body appears as though nude in a mesh of cords (Fig. 2)." It was the Mathura type, together with the Gandharan, that found its way into the Buddhist centers of Turkestan. The modification of the mixed elements of the two styles produced a sort of native Central Asian style,5 a uniform style, marked only by local variations, stretching from Taxila to Ta t'ung-fu.6 At the Rawak vihara, near Khotan, the robes of the Buddha images, although preserving the parallel curving folds of the Mathura drapery, tend towards the ar- rangement at the Ming-oi site of Kara Shahr, where the folds over the thighs are re- presented by straight lines (Fig. 3); at both of these sites the pleats in the hollow between the legs have been broken up into single lunulate shapes, sometimes already separated from the greater curves outlining the folds over the legs and body.'7 The Ii.

The transition from Rawak to the early Chinese Buddha statues is made by the stucco figures of Kyzil and Chotscho, where the long bowstring curves of the Mathura school are definitely broken up into wavy streamers over the thighs; 9 the lower part of the skirt follows the formula seen at Rawak, only that now the robe terminates in a closely bunched mass of rippling folds stirring towards the right leg. As I have pointed out elsewhere, the liaison between sculpture and painting is so close in Central Asia that it is impossible to make any sharp distinction; 20 we may, for instance, follow much the same stylistic evolution in the wall paintings at Bamiyan, and Bezaklik.2' As Bachhofer has noted, the forked fold that had its origin in the Gandhara images to define the drapery over the Buddha's left sleeve,' in the Central Asian statues is made to indicate the disposition of the robe over other parts of the body as well. The extreme of this convention may be studied in the stucco sculpture at Tun Huang; ' it reappears at YUin Kang and in some of the monumental bronzes to be mentioned later. It seems evident that this style must have been already firmly established in the monastic centers along the silk highways as early as the first part of the fifth century, since the first Chinese images made after the initial period of iconoclasm are markedly under the influence of the models of Turkestan. This essentially foreign and not distinctly Chinese type is represented by two of the earliest bronzes dated 440 (Chen Chun-i)5 and 444 (T'ai P'ing-5)," and by the large statue in the Okura museum,27 and so exactly contemporary with the earliest work at YiXn Kang, where the same style is exemplified by the Bodhisattva statues of Caves 17 and 22. Other bronzes made in the reign of Hsiao Wen Ti (471-499) in the years 478 (T'ai Ho-2),2' 482 (T'ai Ho-6),2 485 (T'ai Ho-9),3 and 490 (T'ai Ho-1I4)"' indicate the fondness for this style at the time when the Toba Tartars were established at Ta t'ung-fu. Whether any of the bronzes we are considering were actually made outside of China is, of course, not entirely possible to determine. It seems not unlikely that the craftsmen in Mathura and Khotan would seek to make articles to suit the foreign patron, perhaps actually under the personal direction of the Chinese pilgrim.8"2 There is ample testimony for the copying of famous images, even in T'ang times, as illustrated by the banner with representations of famous Indian Buddha images from Tun HuangY.'

Among the treasures brought to China by Huian tsang was a copy of the sandalwood image of King Udayana." In addition to the testimony of the list of images brought to China by the Master of the Law, evidence for the imitation of famous Indian originals is furnished by the copies of the curious "two-bodied" image at Kanishka's tower at Peshawar found in Turkestan by Kozlov and von Le Coq." One small bronze of extraordinary interest (Fig. 4), in a private collection in Japan, may be a unique example of an importation from India. The drapery of this statuette, even to the "wavy" profile, corresponds closely in arrange- ment to the work of the Gandhara school, particularly to the most classic examples, in which the drapery exists as a volume and has not yet assumed the transparency of the later period. That such metal images were made in northern India is certainly attested by such works as the Bimaran reliquary and the Kanishka casket.' Although the head and drapery of the figure in question resemble the types found on the Graeco-Buddhist reliquary from Bimaran, a work which, in spite of the tendency to date it in the pre-Christian era, I believe is no earlier than the second century A. D. The conclusion that it is almost certainly Chinese is suggested by the head with its caplike ushnisha-completely Six Dynasties in style-and by a comparison of the drapery to what is perhaps the most faithful Chinese transcription of the Gandhara robe, a wooden figure from Tun Huang, a work in which the folds are treated in the purely Chinese linear fashion."7 These statuettes are, seemingly, isolated examples of the true Gandhara style that died without issue; as we have seen, it was the Mathura formula as developed in Central Asia that was favored in China. There is evidence that Buddhism penetrated China in the early years of the Christian era.' Whether or not we believe in the pious fabrication of the Emperor Ming's dream and the importation of the Udayana image to the Pai Ma ssu, it is reasonably certain that images as well as sutras were imported in this same period. By tradition the first cave temples in China were hollowed out at Tun Huang in 366 A. D. For the purpose of a chronological survey of Chinese sculpture, neither the work there nor any dated Buddhist statue earlier than 390 A. D. has survived.39 The earliest dated Chinese Buddhist image known is a miniature bronze figure of Maitreya, formerly in the collection of the Viceroy Tuan Fang.4' We can see here a common type derived from a Gupta model that scarcely changed in the dated examples of the next hundred years.4 So small is the statue that we are scarcely justified in 34.

Even less satisfactory as a document is another statue, dated Shin Jui-2 (415 A. D.).42 From the Chen Chun (T'ai P'ing) era (440-45 1 A. D.) that immediately preceded the perse- cution of Buddhism in 446, a number of statues have survived. Of these, the earliest, dated 440 A. D., has disappeared; ' there remains a small stele of Maitreya in the Matsuda collection in Tokyo with the date 442 A. D. (Fig. 5). Both of these works show a crude interpretation of the seated type of Buddha image as developed in the Mathura school; " there is, also, in the curiously unstructural, incised folds, a sug- gestion of the style of the bronzes of the Southern school of the Six Dynasties period.4 Until we have more definite examples of the work of the Southern dynasties, it remains impossible to reach any conclusion on the importance of this school in the development of Chinese sculpture. The Maitreya of the Matsuda collection is represented seated on the lion throne with the right leg crossed over the left knee and resting his head on his right hand. No single representation of Maitreya in this pose with an inscription confirming the identification is known to exist.' In Japan, however, statues with this iconography, such as the famous example at Chuguji, are traditionally referred to as Miroku (Maitreya) or Nyorin Kwannon.4 Not infrequently this pose was reserved for Sakyamuni.'8 It seems not unlikely that often the sculptors left the identity of their productions ambiguous; the dedication was left to the discretion of the prospective purchaser and donor. In the inscription on the present example there occurs only the statement that a "statue" was dedicated as an act of merit. By far the most important bronze image that has come to light in recent years is a large image of Maitreya (Fig. 6), in a private collection in Tientsin. Bearing an inscription of the year 443 (T'ai P' ing Chen Chun-4), the work is not only one of the earliest dated examples of Chinese sculpture but also is extremely interesting for its relation to the highly similar idol in the Metropolitan Museum (Fig. 7), especially so since the date (Tai Ho-io, or 486 A. D.) on the latter cannot be accepted as beyond question genuine.49 That both of them were copied from a common original, perhaps from a famous Gandhara statue, seems a tempting suggestion, so closely do they agree in pose, and even in such minutiae as the webbing of the fingers, a lakshana possibly suggested by this procedure in Gandhara stone images, which, in bronze, cannot be interpreted as a structural necessity.? It is, certainly, possible that such a colossus as is mentioned by Fa Hian and Hiuan tsang, may have inspired the earliest versions of the Chinese figures of Maitreya. 42. See my no. 3. 43.

Hargreaves, Handbook of Sculpture in the Peshawar Museum, Calcutta, 1930, p. 49, n. 2.</page><page sequence="9">100oo THE ART BULLETIN I quote from Hilan tsang's account: "By the side of a great sangharama in the valley of Ta-li-lo5' is a figure of Maitreya Bodhisattva, carved out of wood. It is golden colored, and very dazzling in appearance, and possesses a secret spiritual power of miracle. It is about ioo feet high, and is the work of the Arhat Madhyantika. This saint, by his spiritual power, caused a sculptor to ascend into the Tushita heaven, that he might see for himself the marks and signs (on the person of Maitreya); and this he did three times, till his task was finished. From the time of the execution of this image the streams of the law (religious teaching) began to flow eastward." " Since the image is represented wearing the type of drapery associated with the Udayana statue of Buddha Sakyamuni, it appears that, although designated as Maitreya, some confusion arose between the legends of the two miraculous statues, that of Maitreya, carved by the Arhat Madhyantika, and the one executed for the King of Kauqambi.53 The fact that Maitreya was to take the place of Sakyamuni on attaining Buddhahood, probably influenced artists to represent him in the guise of the last mortal Buddha. The specific connection of the Ta-li-lo image with China, from the account of both Fa Hian and Hiuan tsang that "the streams of the law began to flow eastward" at the time of its creation, suggests that this particular Indian image would have been frequently copied by the pilgrims and artists from beyond the Pamirs, just as there were brought to China copies of the equally famous Maitreya at Bodh Gaya. It is interesting to compare these two Chinese Maitreya images with the painting of a Gandhara statue labeled "Buddha of the Great Miracle at Sravasti," in the banner with reproductions of Indian cult figures from Tun Huang.' Although, as in the predicament of the classical archaeologist trying to recover a lost Greek original through a Roman copy, it is hopeless for us to seek any of the quality of the Indian original in the Chinese version, it is, at least, legitimate to suppose the existence of some such common prototype for all the statues of this type in China as well as in Turkestan. Two small bronzes in private collections in Tokyo belong to this same group and are distinguished by the same type of drapery even to the arrangement of folds between the ankles, by the same cubic formula for the face."5 What is almost a counterpart of the arrangement of the drapery in these bronzes is to be found in the stucco statues from Kyzil and Chotscho that have been noted as marking one step in the metamorphosis of the Mathura-Gandhara drapery formula.' Likewise, the great hooked forks indicating the folds over the torso are so close to the schematization of the Tun Huang stuccoes as to completely confirm the early date of the inscription. To illustrate further the tremendously close dependence of the Six Dynasties images 51. Darel on the banks of the Indus. 52. Beal, ofp. cit., I, p. xxx and 134; Wegner, oq. cit., p. 267. 53.

In like manner, the re- semblance of the small bronze images of Avalokite- svara of the Northern Wei period to the representation of the Great Bodhisattva on the banner of famous images from Tun Huang suggest that, perhaps, not only the painted version, as hinted by Waley, but also these bronze statuettes may be copies of the famous image at Bodh Gaya.

The actual arrangement of the hem of the skirt in the stucco fragment is so close that it seems that we have to do with works of the same atelier. A close parallel in stone, although of a provincial type, is to be found in a stele in the Loo collection, dated 500 A. D." In many particulars, especially in the convention for the fluttering hem of the robe, these bronzes are closer to the Central Asian models than any of the monumental images at Yi9n Kang and elsewhere, further evidence of the close relations between China and the courts of Khotan in the period of the Wei Kingdom. The statue in Tientsin, although lacking the refinement of the Maitreya in New York is still a very notable figure characterized by the same rising grandeur-a feeling of tremendous exaltation communicated, perhaps most of all, by the great spread and sweep of the outflung robe, like wings unfurled. Both of these statues gain enormously in dignity and solidity by the rather unusual and widespread position of the feet. This firmly planted stance seems traceable to the Central Asian prototypes.' The head of the Maitreya of 443, although fine, lacks something of the splendid architectonic sharpness of planes of its counterpart in New York. It must be noted that, stylistically, the head, like the drapery, is derived from Central Asian models.` The heads of these bronze images, already approaching the cubic character of the developed Chinese style at Lung Men, are notable for the symbolical, abstract quality, beyond the human element, that makes for the greatness of all archaic art-an approach to the metaphysical through what might, almost, be called a reduction to geometric formulae, that finds its analogy in the yantras or representations of deities by mathematical devices. I am inclined to disagree with Sir6n, who dismisses this type of images as un-Chinese and artistically uninteresting.' All of these statues are, obviously, already transformed by the Chinese feeling for line rhythms and the grandly detached and architectonic structure of the final Six Dynasties style. It is this absence of the actuality of representation in terms of flesh and blood, with no interest in the biological and functional relation of the sculptured form, that so often leads the Western critic to discard all of Oriental religious art as merely queer or bizarre, whereas the very absence of the qualities that make for what we call naturalistic representation raise the idol beyond and above the classical standard, whereby the gods are made anthropomorphic to accomodate the limitations of the worshiper in imagining the object of devotion. For the Buddhist worshiper, the cult image was never anything more than an object to concentrate on in meditation, a symbol. Famous in the annals of Chinese archaeology are the five great Buddhas carved by the priest Tan yao on the cliffside at Yiin Kang. The largest of these images is described in the Wei sku as more than seventy-five feet high. This colossal enterprise was begun in 454 at the express command of the Emperor W~n Ch'8ng to commemorate the founder of the Wei dynasty and the four succeeding rulers of 57.

We may, perhaps, safely assume that this notice refers to the five giant statues that occupy the caves I8-22 3 at Yiin Kang. An inscription in the easternmost of these, no. I8, is dated T'ai ho-1I3 (489 A. D.) and suggests that even although the work was begun as early as 454, the decoration of the caves was not complete until much later. The latest authorities to study the Ytin Kang grottoes are of the opinion that the five great caves are later than no. 5, which they assign to the reign of Hsien wen Ti (446-470 A. D.); " Sekino, who, as stated above, believes these caves to be the earliest at Yiin Kang, suggests the possible collaboration of carvers from the Northern Liang tribe who were brought to Ta-t'ung in the evacuation of 39,000 families from Tun Huang in 439 A. D.65 A number of dated bronzes very close to these colossi in style may help us to establish the date of these earliest surviving monumental sculptures in China; some of these miniatures might well be copies. Among these, certainly the most handsome and strong is a figure of the seated Maitreya in the Matsuda collection in Tokyo (Fig. 9); the image radiates strength and a deep spiritual vitality in the firmly erect head over the blocklike mass of the body and lap. The loose folds of the robe over the legs suggest comparison with certain Gandhara images.6 The conception is dominated by the grandly abstract head and the great blessing hand. The border of the robe, deeply chiseled to simulate embroidery, is directly related to the same part of the seated Amitabha of Cave 22 at Yiin Kang (Fig. io), with which in its plastic force, the type of conventionalization, it already enjoys a spiritual union. Over the left sleeve of the bronze Maitreya, as in the colossus at Yiin Kang, are the jagged pitchfork folds. The gilt bronze in Tokyo is dated T'ai ho-2, or 478 A. D., and, by its close stylistic resemblance to figures at Yiin Kang, seems to confirm the dating of the great caves in the reign of Hsiao Wen Ti (471-499 A. D.). Another bronze that belongs to this group is a representation of Sakyamuni and Prabhutaratna, dated T'ai ho-1i3, or 489 A. D.; 6 this small sculpture again affords an exact parallel to the great statues at Yiin Kang, to the Amitabha of Cave 22, and to the seated Buddha of the same year in Cave I8.69 Again, this is one of the many bronzes to favor a subject that was vastly popular in the contemporary cave sculptures. 61.

This figure, although apparently identical with the Maitreya in New York, is designated as a statue of Sakyamuni. In comparison with the former statue and the one of 443 A. D., already discussed, this figure is markedly inferior and indicates, at a remarkably early date, the trend of conventionalization that was to end in the rather empty Buddhist images of the sixteenth century and later in Tibet and China proper.7" A close resemblance, in many particulars, to the gilt bronze figure in Detroit indicates that this latter should, perhaps, be dated considerably earlier than the seventh or ninth century, the period usually suggested by various scholars.7' The system of decorative, rather than functional drapery is, to all intents and purposes, the same in both of these works. We find the same quilted folds radiating from the neck down the median line of the body; as in the earliest examples of the type, the pleats part at the waist to terminate in wavy lines over the thighs.71 Seen in profile, we note that the fifth century statue has the same system of patterned garment folds ending in bifurcated ridges. Although such a small detail may seem irrelevant for comparison, it may be pointed out that both statues have an exactly similar structure in the folds of drapery encircling the neck, even to the collar- like hem of the undergarment. Again, the beginnings of this system of drapery may be seen in the stucco reliefs at Rawak and Chotscho.7' The face of the Detroit Maitreya, although fuller when seen from the front, exhibits certain close analogies to the statue of 496, in the treatment of the planes of the eyes, that give a curious squinting expression, and in the wedgy character of the nose. In both of them there is only a faint survival of the archaic smirk that is so completely developed in the early fifth century images. The hair is made up of a series of segments or gores filled with fine linear incisions, a convention reminding us of similar treatment of hair in the late Gandhara heads and in certain Hellenistic terra cottas. Where objects of art are made for a utilitarian purpose, as objects of worship, and not with aesthetic consideration in view, people are not conscious of what we call degeneration or decadence. No more are they ordinarily conscious of changes in so utilitarian a part of our lives as language. Since the element of style does not concern them, and since they are in no way preoccupied with aesthetic judgment, any figure or symbol will still appear to them perfectly suited to its functions, as a means for the worshiper to address himself to the deity. It must be admitted, however, that a religious image more aesthetically perfect than a mere lump of wood or stone is more efficacious, in that it puts the worshiper in a mood both serene and reverential, through its outward perfection. In the Maitreya in New York, for example, there is a harmony of lines and masses, giving solidity and grandeur and repose, that induces in the worshiper a similar, vicariously experienced mood of peace and, thereby, of 70.

In the De- troit figure, however, as in the famous Shaka of Seiryoji, the drapery between the legs is reduced to mere parellel " trumpet folds," which may represent the development of a later period; cf. also, a pro- vincial bronze of 496 A. D. (Sir6n, op. cit., II, pl. 147A). 72. An almost exactly contemporary example of this treatment of the folds over the thighs may be seen at Lung Men; cf. Omura, ob. cit., pl. 513. 73.

A statue such as the Sakyamuni of 496 which, to us, in retrospect and by comparison with other statues that we know, may seem an inferior product, presented no such complicated emotions to the fifth century Chinese Buddhist, who was interested only in the statue in its most practical aspect.
