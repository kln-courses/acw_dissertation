<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLAUDIUS OF TURIN'S ORGANIC METAPHOR OR THE CAROLINGIAN DOCTRINE OF CORPORATIONS* BY SUZANNE F. WEMPLE IN 1947, the eminent medievalist, Gerhard B. Ladner, advanced a concise for- mula for the interpretation of Carolingian political thought. Invoking the intro- ductory words of Bishop Jonas of Orleans' De institutione regia: "that the uni- versal church is the body of Christ, that the same Christ is its head, and that there are in it mainly two exalted persons, the priestly and the kingly,"' Professor Ladner concluded that the Carolingians replaced the Gelasian concept of the world with the church and assigned a double leadership, sacerdotal and royal, to the church. Only in the eleventh century when the Gregorians attacked the notion that the royal office formed a part of the body of Christ and once again conceived of Christian society as something else than the church, could the theory evolve that the state was a body politic, an organological or corporational self- sufficient community. Although Professor Ladner noted that the body metaphor was part of ancient political theory and was sometimes applied to political func- tions by patristic authors, he insisted that "it can be hardly an accident that in Christian times, before the Gregorian era, it was as a rule not applied to the state but to the church."2 Imperial writers of the late eleventh century were credited also by Ernst Kantorowicz for developing the antithesis between church and state as two sepa- rate bodies.' Otto Gierke, in a similar vein, attributed to the partisans of the empire in the Gregorian era the revival of the pre-Carolingian teaching, according to which sacerdotium and regnum represented two distinct, independent powers.4 In the past forty years Carolingian political thought came under close scholarly scrutiny. It is now quite evident that no single formula can adequately describe it. Even among proponents of the argumentum unitatis there are essential disagree- ments. Arquilliere and Tellenbach posited as the basic principle of Frankish political thought the absorption of the state into the church.

The contemporaries of Charles and Louis the Pious thought of church and state as a single body, the imperium Christianum or corpus Chri8tianum, ruled jointly by the emperor and the pope. They referred, however, to the worldly part of this corpus as res publica.8 Other historians, such as David and Pacaut,9 discerned a legalistic differentia- tion between ecclesiastical and civil powers. The autonomy of the spiritual and temporal orders was upheld, according to David, in the second half of the ninth century.'0 Karl F. Morrison went even further and, rejecting unity as the under- lying principle of ninth century political thought, advanced the thesis that the Carolingians recognized the bipartite nature of human society and distinguished between the laity and the clergy as separate juristic and functional orders, al- though kings, bishops and popes were not always in agreement as to how these two orders were to be governed. Groping toward a definition of church and state as two distinct corporations, the later Frankish bishops argued that the church was to be governed by a conciliar government and that neither kings nor bishops had directive or punitive powers over each other. The church, according to these conciliarists, was a corporation of the clergy and the laity united by the sacra- ments. The state was a respublica held together by military power."

Claudius of Turin's unpublished commentary on First Corinthi- ans seems to support such a thesis.'2 Here, in opposition to the image of the church as the body of Christ, Claudius posited the image of the state as the body of the emperor.'3 St Paul's concept of the church, developed at some detail in I Corinthians xii 12-22, as the body of Christ composed of the faithful performing different func- tions according to their charismatic gifts,'4 was interpreted by Claudius in a prag- matic sense. The Bishop of Turin used St Paul's anthropomorphical metaphor to justify the hierarchical ordering of the church, a body governed by bishops, the successors of the apostles.'5 By juxtaposing to this image the definition of the state as the body of the emperor wherein tribunes, counts, magistri and soldiers were conjoined as members, Claudius expressed in a symbolic analogy the dis- tinction between church and state, one a religious organism and the other a military entity.'6 Since Claudius' image of the empire as a body politic was unprecedented in Frankish literature, this paper will focus upon three questions: what was Clau- dius' source of inspiration; did his image exert any influence upon his contempo- raries or later generation of churchmen; and was the notion of the state as a corporate entity, distinct from the church, expressed in any other form in the writings of the Carolingians? The bare facts of Claudius' life do not suggest that his thoughts had much im- 12 The text is extant in the following manuscripts: Paris Bibl. Nat. Lat. !.392 (s.

Kantorowicz, in his The King's Two Bodies 195ff., have shown, until the middle of the twelfth century the term corpus Christi denoted primarily the church and the term corpus mysticum was usually used to refer to the Eucharist. At that time the two designations changed their meaning. 15 MS Paris Bibl. Nat.

He was a minor figure in Louis the Pious' entou- rage from 811-817, known for his skill in exegesis, which earned him the honor to be entrusted with the instruction at the cathedral school of Ebreuil in Auvergne and then, in 817, with the bishopric of Turin. Claudius did not take part in im- portant decisions or events. Only his intransigent views on the cult of images and relics catapulted him into prominence. But then the charges of heresy proved to be such an ordeal that his health became affected. He died around 828, leaving unanswered the accusation of Dungal, one of his last opponents.'7 It was at Turin, around 820, that Claudius wrote the commentary on I Corin- thians at the request of his friend Theodemir, Abbot of Psalmodi, a monastery in the vicinity of Nimes. Apparently the Abbot was a hot-tempered man; he took offense at Claudius' remark that the commentary would teach the monks a much-needed lesson in humility."8 On the ground that Claudius' denial of the efficacy of good works bore the flavor of heresy, Theodemir sent the work to Aachen for examination. In the preface of a later exegesis, written around 8924, Claudius made it clear that, despite Theodemir's allegation, the work was favor- ably received at the court.'19 The names of the bishops and the optimates who scrutinized the commentary are not known. But Claudius' comment reveals that several members of the court read the work and were therefore familiar with the concept of the empire as a living organism, one that was distinct from the church. Indeed, the very same definition of the state as the emperor's body, albeit not contrasted to the image of the church as a priestly hierarchy, appears in Hrabanus Maurus' commentary 17 The final attack upon Claudius was launched by Jonas of Orleans c. 840, when Claudius was dead. A. Cabannis, "Claudius of Turin" in Early Medieval Theology (ed. H. L. McCracken, The Library of Christian Classics ix, Philadelphia, 1957), 216, n. 21, has argued that Dungal's Responsa appeared c. 827 or 828. For a brief biography, see also P. Bellet's article in New Catholic Encyclopaedia iII (1967), 922.

The anthropomorphic metaphor was applied to the state, the cosmos and humanity in general by fifth and early fourth century Greek authors.22 Plato developed the concept of the state as an organism with fixed relation between parts; Aristotle elaborated on its natural origin.23 Writers under the late Roman Republic and early Empire used the organic metaphor to drive home a lesson for much needed cooperation between the various parts of the commonwealth. Cicero spoke of the harm inflicted upon the whole body if one member for the sake of his own interest injured another.24 Through the fable of Menenius Agrippa, Livy articulated the dependence of the individual upon the whole; when the hands, the mouth and the teeth rebelled against the stomach, the whole body perished.25 Dionysius of Halicarnassus elucidated this fable even further by comparing the stomach to the senate.26 With Seneca the emphasis shifted from injury inflicted upon the whole organism to harm done to individual members. To illustrate the idea that each member of a commonwealth was worthy of respect, Seneca depicted the commonwealth as the prince's body, ruled by its soul, the prince.27 The image of the state as the body of the ruler wherein members were con- joined in political relations was embodied in Roman law. The Theodosian Codex as well as the Justinian Codex referred to senators as pars corporis nostri.28 This metaphor may have inspired the declaration in the Visigothic Code that the health of members of the body politic depended upon the well-being of the prince, its head.29 The anthropomorphical analogy of church and state appears only in an 20 In Epist.

Organic Metaphor N7 Introduction to the Institutes30 which, according to Fitting, was composed be- tween the mid-ninth and the late eleventh century.," A Spaniard by birth, Claudius may have known the Visigothic Code. But he did not draw his organic metaphor of the state from any legal source; he did not borrow it from a pagan author either. He lifted the passage verbatim from Ambro- siaster.82 Since Hrabanus also used Ambrosiaster, we cannot conclude that Claud- ius served as the source for Hrabanus' anthropomorphic image. Other evidence attests that, despite the aspersion of heresy, Claudius' com- mentary on I Corinthians enjoyed popularity for about a century. The text is extant in four ninth and early tenth century manuscripts,33 and at least two bibli- cal interpreters, Haymo of Auxerre34 in the ninth century and Atto of Vercelli in the second quarter of the tenth century, used it quite extensively. The parallel organic metaphors appear in Atto's exegesis. Concerned about the secularization of the Italian clergy that he attributed on the one hand to royal domination of the church and, on the other, to temporal involvements of churchmen, the Bishop of Vercelli represented the church as a moral agency where Christ worked through priests by the powers of love.35 To express his own conviction that church and kingdom were two autonomous institutions and that kings and bishops did not have directive or punitive powers over each other, Atto found Claudius' definition of the state quite suitable as an antithesis to his own image of the church. Substituting duces for Claudius' magistri, Atto de- scribed the state as the king's body politic wherein his officers - dukes, counts, tribunes - and his soldiers as members were united, and where bishops were conspicuously absent.36 Through the commentaries of Ambrosiaster,37 Claudius, Hrabanus38 and Atto,39 .

Nonetheless, the presence of this image in ninth and tenth century exegeses is not cdmpelling enough evidence to attribute to this period a nascent doctrine of a bipartite society. We must also investigate whether the concept of regnum and ecclesia as two autonomous corpo- rate bodies was invoked by polemicists of the period - by authors who dealt with actual conflicts of church and state and delineated the sphere of ecclesiastical and royal jurisdiction. The legal arguments whereby the Carolingian conciliarists revindicated to the priesthood the government of the church and restricted the competence of royal power to temporal matters, need not be repeated here. They have been presented fully by Professor Morrison. The concern of this paper will be the symbolic expressions of church-state relations which provided the con- ceptual framework for the legal arguments of the Frankish bishops. An examination of the records of the councils held in the 820s and 830s shows that the leading churchmen in Louis the Pious's entourage retained the ideal of Christian unity formulated by their predecessors.40 In practical terms this meant that they regarded church and state as one body politic, ruled by two powers, the sacerdotal and the royal. Professor Ladner's thesis that the Carolingians arrived at this position by replacing in the Gelasian formula the concept of the world with that of the church is supported not merely by Jonas of Orleans' De institu- tione regia and the proclamation of the Council of Paris held in 829.41 The same proclamation was reiterated by the Capitulary of Worms, issued in the same year,42 by the Council held at Aachen in 836, and by the Council of Meaux and Paris held in 845-46.43 It was included also in the Capitulary of Benedictus 38 F.

Cathwulf wrote in a similar vein: "Memor esto ergo semper, rex mi, Dei regis tui cum timore et amore, quod tu es in vice illius super omnia membra eius custodire et regere . . . " (Ibid. 503,11. 3-4). It must be noted that Charles' interference in ecclesiastical affairs grew out of the Merovingian system of proprietary churches (on this, see F. Kern, Gottesgnadentum und Widerstandsrecht im friihen Mittelalter [Qnd ed. Munster, 19541 72). 41 MGH Cone. ii, 610, 8. 33-35. 42 MGII Capit. ii, 29, 11. 19ff.

Ibid., 723, H. 13-14: "Constat autem eam peregrinantem duabus . . . praesentialiter personis gubernari, sacerdotali scilicet ac regali." For the declaration of the Council of Meaux and Paris, see infra note 77.</page><page sequence="8">Claudius of Turin's Organic Metaphor 229 Levita." Following the same line of thought, Agobard of Lyons argued that the diversity of secular laws was an obstacle to the unity for which Christ had died45 and declared that both kings and bishops were "Ecclesiae Galliarum . . rec- tores."46 The achievement of these churchmen was to construe the priesthood's unique power to bind and to loose as a claim for precedence of bishops over kings.47 They also used it to draw a demarcation line between the two supreme powers and to limit the competence of kings in matters pertaining to the clerical order or ec- clesiastical property to an auxiliary role, to the enforcement of canons by the terror of arms.48 The formulation of the notion of a dualistic society where church and state might function as two autonomous bodies was left to Hinemar of Rheims, leader of the next generation of conciliarists.49 Hinemar relinquished the unitary vision of church and state. The kingdom he designated as res publica, temporal in nature and distinct from the ecclesia,50 which he thought of as a spiritual body held together by the sacraments.61 The juxtaposition of res publica and ecclesia was not unprecedented in Carolingian writings. Bishop Wala in a pamphlet addressed to the Diet to be convened in the 44 Cap. 1.318-319 (PL xcvii, 742B). 46 Liber adv. legem Gund. 4 (MGH Epist. v, 159, and PL civ, 115D-116A).

L. W. Laistner, The Intellectual Heritage during the Early Middle Ages [Ithaca, 1957] 40-56). Already in 816, the Council held at Aachen (MGH Cone. ii, 323,11. 24-27, cap. 9), stressed the priesthood's power to bind and to loose and to teach "in toto orbe" and "per totum mundum." A. Solmi, in his Stato e Chiesa (Modena 1901) Q9, linked the juridical power of priests with the sacerdotal claim that the king's duty was merely to act as the executor of conciliar decisions. For a description of the use Carolingian churchmen made of their juridical power, see Ullmann, Carolingian Renaissance, 65ff. 48 For example, Agobard in his Epist. 5.4 (MGH Epist. v, 167): " . . . principum providentia leges promulgarentur, et episcoporum sollicitudine canones statuerentur." The Council of Paris (829) cap. 2 (MGH Conc. ii, 652, 11. 33-35) without identifying its source, reiterated Isidore of Seville's declaration (Sententiae 3.51; PL LxxiiI, 793-24): "Ceterum intra ecclesiam potestates necessariae non essent, nisi ut, quod non praevalet sacerdos efficere per doctrinam sermonem, potestas hoc im- peret per disciplinae terrorem." Imperial rights over ecclesiastical property were rejected by the Council of Aachen (839) cap. 8 (MGH Conc. ii, 718-719), and also in a letter Jonas of Orleans wrote at the request of the Council (Ibid., 730). 49 On Hincmar's life and activity the best monograph is still H.

Not these famous passages but 5.24, was quoted by Jonas of Orleans, De institutione regia 17 (Reviron, Les idges, 194, and PL cvi, 304D). On Augustine's meaning of the term, see W. Suerbaum, Vom antiken zumfrilhmittelalter- lichen Staatsbegriffe (Mtinster, 1961), 173-88, 196, 201; and also the different conclusion reached by J. duQuesnay Adams, in his The Populus of Augustine and Jerome (New Haven, 1971),;130-31. 64 Gregory used the expression either in its simple form as "res publica," for example Registrum Ep. xiii, 34 (MGB Epist. II, 397,1. 21), or as "christiana res publica" Ep. IX, 67 (Ibid., II, 88,1. 6), "sancta res publica," Ep. I, 16a (Ibid., r, 18,1. 29; I, 18,1. 34), "pia res publica," Ep. v, 38 (Ibid., r, 325, 1. 1), or as "universa respublica," Ep. XIII, 42 (Ibid., I, 404,1. 31). For other passages where these expressions appear, see the index to Gregory's Registrum (Ibid., II, 586). Scholars are in agree- ment that in each instance Gregory used the expression to designate the Roman Empire. See Fulvio Crosara, "Respublica e respublicae," Atti del Congresso Internazionale di Diritto Romano e di Storia del Diritto, Verona, 1948 (ed. G. Moschetti, IV [Milan, 19531, 259) and W. Gundlach, Die Entstehung der Kirchenstaates und der curiale Begriff Res publica Romanorum (Untersuchungem zur deutschen Staats- und Rechtsgeschichte vii, ed. Gierke; Breslau, 1899), 29. 56 Wilhelm Gundlach's thesis, Die Entstehung der Kirchenstaates, 28ff., that in letters and documents emanating from the papal curia around the mid-eighth century res publica was used as a reference to the papal states, has been refuted by E. Caspar, Pippin und die r6mische Kirche (Berlin, 1914) 165, and by K.l Heldmann, Das Kaisertum Karls des Grossen (Weimar, 1928), 115ff. As Suerbaum, in his Vom antiken zum mittelalterlichen Staatsbegriffe, 304-05, has shown, Gundlach's argument rests on an ambiguous statement of Pope Stephen II (MGH Epist. III, 489, 1. 18):"... beato Petro sanctaeque Dei ecclesiae, rei publice Romanorum, reddere," and Ibid., 489, 1. 33:" ... sanctaeque Dei ecclesiae rei publice civitates ... restituenda...." Since the double genitive construction may be inter- preted as the church of the Roman res publica or as the res publica of the church, we cannot accept this statement as evidence that res publica Romanorum referred to the papal estates. 56 Frankish bishops around 821 sent Emperor Lothar the following admonition: "Pro statu regni et reipublicae, ne forte humilietur aut infirmeretur, divina primum exoretur clementia ..." MGH Capit. i, 370, cap. 14. 57 Thus, priests were to render obedience they owed to the res publica to the bishops, their own</page><page sequence="10">Claudius of Turin's Organic Metaphor 1 the application of the term was restricted to Wala's sense and it served to dis- tinguish imperial property from ecclesiastical possessions.10 The meaning of res publica was raised by Hinemar to a new level. Hinemar invoked the term to refer to the regnum, a body politic separate from the church,. which he alluded to as God's city, God's kingdom, Christ's dove, and Christ's body.2 By narrowing down the concept of res publica, Hinemar reverted to the original intention of Gelasius' formula. He thought of Gelasius' world as Chris- tianity, ruled by pontifical authority and royal power,63 each governing through immediate superiors (MGI Capit. i, 328): " . . . presbyteri debitam obedientiam rei publice et honorem exhibeant episcopis suis." See also Ibid., I, 332, No. 166, cap. 4. 58 Conc. Cabillonense (813) (MGH Conc. ii, 278, I. 1-9): "Comitibus ... et iudicibus hoc summo- pere observandum est, ut iuste iudicent. . . Testes vero probatissimi. . . esse debent. .. Multum autem pravorum testium cupiditate et falsitate res publica laeditur." The term was used in the same sense in a capitulary issued by Louis the Pious (MGH Capit. I, 367, H. 31-32): "Quia sunt in plerisque locis parricidae et ceteri homicidae vel reliquis capitalibus criminibus implicati ... qui utique rei publicae utilitatibus inutiles sunt.... " Ewig's thesis ("Zum christlichen Konigsgedanken," 72) that res publica denoted the "weltliche Sektor" of the Frankish Empire is supported by the following statement (MGH Capit. i, 274, 1. 32): " . . . si quid in ecclesiasticis negotiis sive in statu reipublicae emendatione dignum perspexissemus ... emendarentur." It is important, though, to remember that the well-being of the res publica necessitated the maintenance of churches, Conc. Aquis. (836) (MGH Conc. ii, 722, 1. 11): "Sed quia id exigit reipublicae necessitas, saltem conlapsa loca erigi debent et clerici locis, in quibus fuerant, restitui. For additional passages where res publica appears see Ewig, 72 n. 304. 59 Conc. Parisiense (829) (MGIH Conc. ii, 677, 1. 19): . . . in eligendis adiutoribus vestris et rei- publicae ministris, qui vice vestra populum Die regere et gubernare atque iudicare debent...." The expression "ministri rei publicae" appears also in capitularies issued by Charlemagne and Louis the Pious (see for example, MGH Capit. i, 197, cap. 6; i, 327, cap. 8). That these men were imperial agents is made evident by the following statement (Ibid., i, 204, 1. 26): "Karolus ... Romanorum regens imperium . . . omnibus ducibus, comitibus, gastaldiis seu cunctis rei publicae per provincias Italiae a nostra mansuetudine praepositis...." Variations of the same designation were "minis- teriales rei publicae" (Ibid., i, 217, 1. 29), and "rei publicae administratores" (Ibid., ii, 398,1. 12). 6 MGH Cap. iI, 300, 1. 46: "Voluimus etiam ut . . . venditis tam ex re publica quam ex rebus ec- clesiasticis ....."; Ibid., ii, 403,1. 34, " ... et ... res publica ... et ecclesiae habeantur immunes." 61 Epist. 27 (PL cxxvi, 184D-185A) addressed to Pope Hadrian II: "ne talia nobis cujuscunque mandetis, unde inter episcopalem auctoritatem et regalem potestatem, inter Ecclesiam et Rempu- blicam .. . scandalum possit oriri...." In the same letter he reported that an assembly of "ecclesi- astici et saecularis ordinis viri" rejected Hadrian's request to excommunicate Charles the Bald on the ground that the pope (181A-B): " . . . rex et episcopus simul esse non potest, et sui antecessores ecclesiasticum ordinem quod suum est, et non rempublicam quod regum est disposuerunt."

The harmony between the two institutions was maintained, he believed, by the laws of Christianity. These laws were to govern both the regnum and the ecclesia, although they were administered in the one by princes and in the other by bishops.66 Since one body was temporal and the other spiritual, the laws were to be applied differently in each; where civil law demanded capital punishment, canon law had to rely on degradation and excommunication.67 Only Christ could rule over both res publica and ecclesia; he alone was both king and priest.68 Al- though the episcopal dignity was greater than the royal one because bishops con- secrated kings,"9 bishops could not partake in the government of the kingdom.70 Likewise, kings could not preside over the church,7' although they were bound by 64 The king is assisted by "duces et comites" (Ad episcopos, PL cxxv, 1015D) and by "reipublicae ministri" (De ordine 8, MGH Capit. ii, 520, 1. 29). The church is ruled by bishops under the direct supervision of metropolitans and the paternal care of the pope (In causa Hincmari, PL cxxvi, 535A). The priesthood is divided into two orders: "in summis videlicet pontificibus et in minoris ordinis sacerdotibus, qui nunc presbyteratus funguntur officio." (De ordine, 4, MGH Capit. ii, 519, 1. 8). 66 Hincmar referred to the priesthood as the head of Christ's body (De divortio, PL cxxv, 643D- 644A), as "throni Dei in quibus Deus sedet et per quos sua dicernit judicia" (Ibid., 758A): or as the altar in God's temple (De coercendo, Ibid. 1010A). The Synod of Kierzy held in 838 (MGH Conc. ii, 769, 1. 30) accorded to bishops only the function of eyes in Christ's body. Earlier though, Florus of Lyons proclaimed that "ecclesia in sacerdotibus consistit" (PL cxix, 421). On Florus' source, see F. Maasen, Sb. Akad. Vienna, Phil.-hist. Klasse XCIJ (1898), 394. 66 De divortio (PL cxxv, 746D): "Unum regnum, una Christi columba videlicet sancta Ecclesia, unius Christianitatis lege regni unius et unius Ecclesiae, quamquam per plures regni principes et ecclesiarum praesules gubernacula moderentur." De ordine palatii 8 (MGH Capit. ii, 520, 1. 25) de- clared that ". . . nulli sacerdoti suos liceat canones ignorare.... Habent enim reges et reipublicae ministri leges, quibus ... regere debent." But these laws must be based on divine law; and kings can- not "contra leges divinas ... agere per contemptum." (cap. 9, Ibid., 590, 1. 36). When civil law does not conflict with divine law "utrumque servaretur: sin autem, lex saeculi merito comprimeretur, iustitia Dei conservaretur" (cap. 21, Ibid., 55, 1. 4). 67 De divortio (PL cxxv, 643A): "Sic et quod leges civiles ministerio reipublicae morte condemnunt, leges ecclesiasticae degradationis vel excommunicationis judicio puniunt." 88 De divortio, PL cxxv, 769 (see note 63, supra).

The same statement appears in Capitula in synodo apud s. Macram (Ibid., 1071). 70 Ad episcopos regni (PL cxxv, 1008D): " . . . et ideo militans Deo minime se negotiis saecularibus implicaret [ii Tim. ii], ac vicissim non ille rebus divinis praesidere videretur qui esset negotiis saecu- laribus implicatus, ut et modestia utriusque ordinis curaretur ...." Prohibitions for clerks to bear arms appeared also in the capitularies; for example Cap. in synodo acta apud Meldensem 37 (MGH Capit. ii, 407, 11. 13-17): "Ut, quicumque ex clero esse videntur, arma militaria non sumant nec ar- mati incedant ... quia non possunt simul Deo et saeculo militare." Hinemar carried the functional distinction between "milites saeculi" and "milites Christi" to the institutional level of church and state.

Partnership was to the mutual ad- vantage of the two fledgling institutions. The union between regnum and ecclesia enabled Charlemagne to stem at least momentarily the forces of particularism. Even under his successors, when fissures appeared in the Carolingian edifice and disputes arose between kings and bishops, the bishops kept on insisting that it was the kings' duty to safeguard churches, respect and support the rights of the clergy, and uphold ecclesiastical laws.74 This ecclesiastical mandate worked against the conceptual distinction between church and state. It was frequently interpreted as justifying royal participation in church government. Hrabanus Maurus allotted to the emperor not only the government of his own body politic but also that of the body of Christ.75 Even Hincmar's pen slipped occasionally in this regard. In a letter addressed to Louis the German, the Bishop of Rheims reverted to the ministerial or auxiliary function of kingship and wrote that Christ divided the government of the church between pontifical authority and royal power.76 In so doing, he may have been influenced by the declaration 72 Capitula in 8ynodo apud 8. Macram (PL cxxv, 1077C): "Regiam vero dignitatem, et ministros reipublicae ac cooperatores regii ministri, episcopali auctoritate et Domini voce monemus. . . ut adjutores Dei fieri . . . et sanctae Ecclesiae vel servorum illius honoratores ... fiant." See also Ibid. 1071C. Epidola 1.7, addressed to Louis the German (PL cxxvi, 14A-B): " . . . debita episcopis et sibis commissis ecclesiis privilegia intemerata, sicut divinitus constituta sunt, custodite. Praecepta et immunitates et honorem earum ... conservare curate.... Ut episcopi quietam libertatem suas parochias circumeundi, et praedicandi ac confirmandi atque corrigendi habeant, ordinate." Ad epi8copo8 regni (PL cxxv, 1009A): " . . . et tanto in humanibus rebus regum cura est propensior, quam sacerdotum, quanto pro honore et defensione et quiete sanctae Ecclesiae, ac rectorum et mini- strorum ipsius, et leges promulgando ac militando, a Rege regum est eis curae onus impositum." See also De offlcii8 epiwcoporum (PL cxxv, 1090C), Epistola 20 (PL cxxvi, 119A), Ad Carolum (PL cxxv, 991C). 7 Ad episcopo0 regni (PL cxxv, 1010): The consent of the prince is to be obtained in episcopal elec- tions because the prince "res ecclesiasticas divino judicio ad tuendas et defensandas suscepit." The same principle is stated in De ordine 9 (MGH Capit. iI, 520). 7 Hincmar included in coronation ordine8 the following promises: Coronatio Caroli Calvi (869) (PL cxxv, 804D-805A): " . . . sciatis me honorem et cultum Dei atque sanctarum ecclesiarum ... conservare, et unumquemque vestrum secundum sui ordinis dignitatem et personam . . . honorare et salvare . . . et unicuique in suo ordine secundum sibi competentes leges tam ecclesiasticas quam mundanas . . . conservare." Coronatio Ludovici II (877) (PL cxxv, 809): " . . . canonicum privi- legium et debitam legem atque justitiam conservabo, et defensionem .. . exhibebo...." Hincmar was quick to remind kings of their oath, for example see his Epist. 40 to Charles the Bald (PL cxxv, 261C). 75 Epit. 18 (MGH Epid. v, 423):".. ideo bene convenit piissimo principi, hoc est rectori mem- brorum veri regis Christi... 78 Epidt. 1.25 (PL cxxv, 24D-95A; MGH Capit. xi, 440, 1. 39):" .. . qui solus rex fieri potuit et sacerdos, et in coelum ascendens suum regnum, id est suam Ecclesiam, inter pontificalem auctorita- tem et regiam potestatem gubernandum disposuit. ...

In his letter to Louis the German, he was therefore quick to add that only Christ could act as king and priest. Since Christ had ruled the church with his apostles and had created the bishops as the apostles' successors, bishops were to teach and govern kings.79 In favor of the unitary concept of church and state there was also the Carolin- gian practice of requiring an oath of fidelity from bishops. This meant that per- sonal loyalties were substituted for the impersonal allegiance to the state and bishops were treated as royal vassals. IHincmar warmed that "we bishops, conse- crated to God, are not ordinary men so that we could, like secular men, commend ourselves as vassals to whomever we wish, but only for the sake of protection and assistance in ecclesiastical government must we commit ourselves and our churches; nor can we take an oath which is forbidden to us by evangelical, apos- tolic and canonical authority."80 Despite the occasional ambiguities in Hinemar's writings, there is no doubt that he was working towards an institutional separation of church and state. The achievement of Hinemar of Rheims, Claudius of Turin and Atto of Vercelli in defining church and state as two distinct entities is best seen if we compare their symbolic terminology with that of the late eleventh century churchmen. Most publicists of the investiture controversy, whether they favored the papal or the imperial-royal side, regarded church and state as one body politic. They were, though, in essential disagreement whether the pope or the prince was the ruling member of this body. Hugh of Fleury,8" a representative of the conservative view of church-state relations - one that advocated peaceful and harmonious cooperation between kings and priests reiterated the Gelasian formula only to assert that bishops were members of the king's body politic. For the sake of unity in the universitas regni, Hugh rejected the Gregorian doctrine and gave precedence to the king over 77 Conc. Meldense Parisiense 8 (MGII Capit. ii, 399): "ita ecclesiam dispositam esse, ut pontificali auctoritate et regali potestate gubernetur...." 78 On this, see the illuminating exposition of Ullmann, The Carolingian Renaissance, 84ff., and also the preface of the Conc. Meld. Par. where it was clearly stated: "Sacerdotum est enim divina populo dare mandata . . . " (MGH Capit. ii, 395,1. 25). 79 See supra note 76. 80 Epist. 1.15 (PL cxxvi, 93B-C and MGH Capit. ii, 439,11. 30ff.): "Et nos episcopi Domino con- secrati, non sumus hujusmodi homines ut, sicut homines saeculares, in vassallatico debeamus nos cuilibet commendare -sed ad defensionem et ad adjutorium gubernationis in ecclesiastico regimine nos, ecclesiasque nostras committere - aut jurationis sacramentum, quod nos evangelica et apos- tolica atque canonica auctoritas vetat, debeamus quoquomodo facere." 81 On Hugh of Fleury, see N. Cantor, Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England (Princeton, 1958), 226ff.</page><page sequence="14">Claudius of Turin's Organic Metaphor 235 the bishops. The king, Hugh said, bore the image of God the Father, and was the head of the kingdom, his own body. Bishops, being the representatives of Christ, were to be subject to the king, as Christ had been subject to the Father.82 The vision of the prince as the head of Christ's body was invoked by Gregory of Catina, monk of Farfa, an outspoken champion of traditional imperial rights over the church. On the basis of a citation from Pseudo-Chrysostom, where the function of the head in the church was attributed to the kingdom and the work of the heart and the stomach to the priesthood, Gregory concluded that it was only proper for prelates to receive their office from the emperor.83 The unitary doctrine of church and state was upheld also by members of the Gregorian party. Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida appropriated a passage from the Apostolic Constitutions and expressed the relationship of the emperor and the pope through the symbol of body and soul.84 The organic unity of church and state was not relinquished even by Pope Gregory VII. In one of his early letters, written to Philip of Swabia in 1073 before he had launched his attack on Henry IV, he referred to kings and priests as the two eyes in Christ's body.85 The juxtaposition of church and state as corpus ecclesiae and corpus rei publicae appears, to my knowledge, only in the De unitate ecclesiae. The author of this treatise charged Pope Gregory VII with the offense of sowing dissent between the two bodies.86 This dual image of church and state could have served equally 82 Tractatus de regia potestate et sacerdotali dignitate 2 (MGI Ldl ii, 468): "Verumptamen rex in regni sui corpore Patris omnipotentis optinere videtur imaginem, et episcopus Christi. Unde rite regi subiacere videntur omnes regni ipsius episcopi, sicut Patri Filius deprehenditur esse subiectus, non natura, sed ordine, ut universitas regni ad unum redigatur principium." 83 Orthodoxa defensio imperialis 2 (MGl Ldl ii, 536, 11. 18-27): "Quod vero caput ecclesiae regem debeamus intelligere ammonet scriptura divina.... De quo Iohannes Chrisostomus inquit: 'Habet autem sancta ecclesia caput quod est regnum, habet cor quod est sacerdotium.... Cor autem et stomachus intelligitur sacerdotium . . . '" (Ibid., 537, 1. 13): " . . . non incongruum videtur, Si praelati ecclesiae ab imperatore prius suscipiant proprii honoris, investitura baculi vel anuli assen- sum, quam a pontifice consecrentur; quia si princeps caput ecclesiae predicatur, a membrorum suorum officii sive ministrii creatione nullo modo est repellendus." The above citation that the editor could not identify (note 2), is from Pseudo-Chrysostom, Opus imperfectum in Mattheum 29.1 (PG LVI, 825). For a bibliography of studies on Pseudo-Chrysostom's Opus imperfectum, see Stegmiiller, Reper- torium iII, 297. According to K. Jordan, "Der Kaisergedanke in Ravenna zur Zeit Heinrichs IV," Deutsches Archiv II (1938), 113-14, it was compiled in Spain in the second half of the sixth century, probably by Bishop Martin of Braga. But G. Morin in his articles in Revue benedictine xxxvii (1925), e39-262; LIV (1942), 9-11, has attributed it to a compiler working at the court of Theodoric in Ravenna in the early sixth century.

But the concepts formulated by the author of the De unitate ecclesiae did not exert much influence upon twelfth century political theory. John of Salisbury's symbolism of' the state as the king's body politic whose soul was constituted by the priesthood was merely an exten- sion, a full articulation of the body-soul analogy which had occurred in Cardinal Humbert's treatise.87 Credit must therefore be given to the Carolingians and not to the Gregorians for the formulation of a corporate doctrine of church-state relations. Ninth and tenth century writers did not have full access to Roman law which embodied both the notion of res publica as a political community and the anthropomorphic image of the state as a body politic. They were also unfamiliar with the Greek and Roman concept of the state as a natural organism. By appropriating, how- ever, Ambrosiaster's metaphor of the state as the emperor's body politic and by juxtaposing this metaphor to that of the church as the body of Christ, Claudius of Turin and Atto of Vercelli approximated the modern doctrine of the separation of church and state. Their intent was not to develop a theory that the state was a self-sufficient organic unity. They merely wanted to set apart the church as a spiritual organism from the state as a military entity. In so doing they extended to the institutional level the distinction drawn in the capitularies and expressed so eloquently by Pope Nicholas I between the function of knights, milites saeculi, who were to fight by arms and the function of priests, milites ecclesiae or milites Christi, who were to celebrate the mass and perform the sacrament of Christ's body and blood.88 But the significance of Claudius' and Atto's anthropomorphical image of the state extended beyond the redefinition of the regnum as a warring institution, secular in its organization. The idea that in this body members per- formed functions not only as private services to the prince but also for the well- being of the whole organism, implied the interdependence of individuals in a political community. Claudius' analogy of church and state as two bodies would have fitted per- fectly into Hincmar of Rheims' concept of church-state relations. Apparently, though, Hincmar's activities as bishop, statesman and jurist did not leave him unum corpus ecclesiae, quatinus perinde etiam possit fieri unum corpus rei publicae...."

The term corpus rei publicae appeared not in Hinemar's writings but in the De unitate ecclesiae, written in the late eleventh century. Later, John of Salisbury used res publica as a synonym to the king's body politic. Claudius, Atto, and Hincmar had anticipated, however, not John of Salisbury's political theory but the dualistic position of a group of twelfth century canonists whose most prominent spokesman was Huguccio of Pisa.89 It is not possible to establish a connection between Hincmar of Rheims and these twelfth century opponents of church-state unity. It was not the corporeal duality of church and state that engaged the attention of these canonists. Their argument centered around the divinely ordained, independent origin of the two institutions.9" We cannot conclude, therefore, that there was a subcurrent of dualistic tradition running from the ninth to the twelfth century. It is likewise impossible to assert that the anthropomorphical image of the state as a self-suffi- cient community - one that appeared in an embryonic form in the commentaries of Ambrosiaster, Claudius, Hrabanus and Atto - played an important role in the development of dualistic political theory. Nonetheless, Claudius of Turin's, Atto of Vercelli's, and Hincmar of Rheims' attempts to formulate a corporate doctrine of church-state relations are not devoid of interest. They show that the unitary vision of church and state was rejected by some important ninth and tenth cen- tury thinkers.
