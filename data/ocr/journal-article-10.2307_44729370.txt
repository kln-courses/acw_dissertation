Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. Abstract While evaluating the BIOSID advanced side impact dum- my in full scale crash tests, we noticed higher than expect- ed abdominal rib deflections. This finding led to a search to determine whether these deflections were an artifact of the dummy or whether the dummy was indicating that some portion of the vehicle side, in the area of the arm- rest, was laterally stronger than expected. Many arm- rests/trim panels were procured and both quasi-statically and dynamically tested using newly-devised test proce- dures. A team was formed to evaluate armrest/trim panel construction and to develop a biomechanically-based laboratory test procedure to help determine the effects of design and material changes. This team continues to function and a spin-off team is seeking to develop analyti- cal predictive tools .to allow speedier development of armrest/trim panels attuned to the new test procedure. At the same time, other procedures were developed by the team to help the armrest area remain a durable and func- tional part of the overall vehicle. Background Federal regulations to which armrest designs must con- form, do not define or specify the crush characteristics or energy absorbing requirements of armrests, or indicate the effect of the design on human injury potential (to the extent that measurement in any laboratory test correlates with human injury potential). The provisions for armrests specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 201 , Section 3.5, pro- vide three options for certifying an armrest. (a) "It shall be constructed with energy absorbing material and shall deflect or collapse laterally at least 2 inches without permitting contact with an underlying rigid material." (b) "It shall be constructed with energy absorbing material that deflects or collapses to within 1.25 inches of a rigid test panel surface without permitting contact with any rigid material. Any rigid material between 0.5 and 1 .25 inches from the panel surface shall have a mini- mum vertical height of not less than 1 inch." (c) "Along not less than 2 continuous inches of its length, the armrest shall, when measured vertically in side elevation, provide at least 2 inches of coverage within the pelvic impact area." During 1990 and 1991, a number of crash tests were experimentally conducted to help evaluate the then-new BIOSID advanced side impact dummy in relation to its durability and measurement capability. This dummy has six biomechanically-tuned "ribs" down its side - one to indicate shoulder displacement; three to indicate chest displacement; and two to indicate abdominal displacement or "penetration" (Figure 1). When these data were pulled together and analyzed in late 1991, one of the surprises was generally higher abdominal "rib" deflection than shoul- der or thoracic rib displacement and a higher abdominal "rib" viscous criterion (V*c) compared to that from the thoracic ribs. The question was thus generated as to whether these higher values were the result of an artifact, an anomaly, of the BIOSID, or was the BIOSID giving new and reliable information that a portion of the vehicle side - perhaps the armrest system ~ was stiffer laterally than expected? This higher than expected abdominal loading had never been seen while testing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) SID dummy - the dummy mandated for use for compliance with Federal Motor Vehi- cle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 214, the Federal side impact safety standard which was finalized in that same time period. The SID dummy has no provision to directly indi- cate abdominal force or penetration; in fact, as will be noted, several papers have indicated that stiffer armrests 3202</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1 - The BIOSID dummy ribcage, showing one shoulder "rib," three thoracic ribs and two abdominal area "ribs." can result in lower Thoracic Trauma Index [TTI(d)] values, the measure by which a vehicle is said to pass or fail the side impact test. While considering the meaning of the BIOSID test results a 1991 paper from Europe(1) was reviewed which evaluat- ed the SID and BIOSID. The SAAB tests were conducted with a normal and very stiff armrest. One of the author's conclusions is that "Using the SID dummy, the TTI [Tho- racic Trauma Index - NHTSA's mandated injury criterion for the chest] value can be reduced by designing a stiffer armrest. This increases the load on [the] abdomen with a dramatic increase of compression and V*c measured in [the] abdomen of BIOSID." Thus, without testing with BIOSID, it appears that one could inadvertently design a stiff armrest, thinking one was helping the occupant by reducing TTI(d). The paper concludes, "At SAAB, we are convinced that by only using the SID in development tests in order to improve side impact test performance, there is a risk to reduce field accident performance for side im- pacts. With this in mind we prefer to use the BIOSID in our development tests for new car models." Therefore, at least SAAB believed the BIOSID was giving meaningful data. A search was made for other highway data that would relate to the armrest area. NHTSA data(2) indicated that the chest-to-upper-interior was the number one injury category, but that abdomen-to-side-surface (which appar- ently includes the armrest area) is the number two injury category. United Kingdom data(3'4'5) showed that 59% of fatal struck-side occupants had AIS&gt;3 ("serious") abdomi- nal injuries. Rouhana and Foster(6) published side impact injury causation data which take into account both fre- quency and severity. These data rank the side interior and the steering wheel as the first two causes of AIS&gt;3 injury for the driver in left-side impacts, with the armrest ranking third. For abdominal injury only, the armrest was associated with 30% of the driver's injury and 28% of the passenger's injury. These data helped reinforce the thought that the BIOSID was indeed indicating a stiffer than expected area of the vehicle. Currently Canada has initiated rulemaking^ intended to help reduce injuries in side impacts by means of a full- vehicle dynamic crash test. The proposal states, "The use of a dummy which has the capability of affording abdomi- nal injury assessment such as the BioSID or EuroSID dummy in a dynamic test is required." Laboratory Testing of Armrests - Dynamic Ram Test In late 1991 an experimental test procedure was devel- oped where an armrest or armrest/trim panel assembly (where the two were integrated) was mounted to a verti- cally-oriented aluminum plate attached to a mini-sled (Figure 2). The total moving mass was 44 kg. The arm- rest dynamically contacted a fixed, vertically-mounted 150 mm diameter cylindrical ram, similar to the ram used above, attached via load cells to an immovable framework. Test speed was nominally 24 km/h. Instrumentation con- sisted of a sled accelerometer, three load cells mounting the ram to the framework, a ram accelerometer for F=ma correction (if necessary), a linear potentiometer to help indicate dynamic armrest penetration by the ram, and a Figure 2 -- Mini-sled test with armrest assembly contacting load-cell-mounted hemicylinder 3203</page><page sequence="3">5000 frame-per-second camera. The five arbitrarily cho- sen armrest assemblies were tested in positions roughly corresponding to the most forward, mid, and rearmost seating positions of the vehicles from which the armrests were taken. Data were filtered at SAE Channel Class 1 80(8). The goal of these early test procedures was to indicate a worst-case condition - when the armrest assembly was rigidly backed up and could not deflect into the door cavity at all. In the real world, such a condition might occur during a side impact with a tree or other extremely stiff surface that penetrated the door inner space at the level of the armrest, all the way to the inner panel, so no inner panel deflection would be possible. The chief measurement in this test was the load when the armrest was deflected to 25 mm of its surrounding surface by the ram. Although it was difficult to accurately deter- mine the 25 mm point because of the curved surfaces involved, approximate loads during these dynamic tests ranged from 8 to 18 kN in the approximate mid-seat posi- tion, with substantial variations between the two tests conducted (Table I). Loads also varied considerably for impacts to different portions of the armrests.

Based on research by Viano&lt;9) for 50 mm deflection, the cadaver abdominal force-deflection corridors had a mini- mum force level of about 0.9 kN at 4.8 m/s and 1 .8 kN at 9.4 m/s. The minimum force was chosen because some armrests may present a narrower profile to the occupant's side than the ram used by Viano. So, ideally, armrest test loads in the 1 .5 kN range were thought to be desirable to cover essentially all persons to the degree that elderly cadavers represent living vehicle occupants. But since this test had inherent measurement inaccuracies, and since the lateral non-deformed width of the tested arm- rests varied by as much as 38 mm, the ram load did not necessarily indicate the performance of the armrest in a crash test with dummies designed to have reasonable abdominal biofidelity. It was therefore postulated that the BIOSID advanced side impact dummy would need to be used to more closely assess relative real-world perfor- mance (to the extent any laboratory test and any dummy can evaluate real-world conditions). Further confirmation of our biomechanical goals was found. Viano(10) reported on biomechanical tests using the SID, BIOSID and animals, which struck identically-shaped armrests of three stiffnesses. The armrest loads were about 1 .1 , 3.7 and 7.0 kN at 25 mm deflection. The "soft" armrest gave 33-37 mm BIOSID abdominal rib deflection and caused only AIS-2(11) ("moderate") injuries to the animals. The "medium" stiffness armrest gave 62-75 mm BIOSID rib deflection and caused AIS-4 ("severe") injuries to the animals. The "stiff" armrest was not animal tested since the injuries were already severe. Both the "moder- ate" and "stiff" armrests lowered TTI(d) readings with the SID dummy, unless the armrest was high enough to con- tact the dummy's thoracic ribcage. These tests indicated that the preliminary 1 .5 kN maximum ram load bogey was about right, biomechanicalty. On the other hand, data published by Rouhana and Kroell(12) indicated that the abdominal area, at least in animal testing, needs support during a lateral crash event, or spleen, liver and ribs injuries can increase. So it ap- peared a balance was needed so that the vehicle side would load the abdominal area, yet the loading be suffi- ciently low to reduce the possibility of deflection-type injury. It was also published by Mertz(13) that the BIOSID abdomi- nal rib deflection during a crash test should not exceed 39 mm. That is consistent with the Viano data, above, from the "soft" armrest. The precautions in using such "Injury Assessment Reference Values" (lARVs) mentioned by Mertz on page 80 of the above reference should be care- fully noted. He states, "Each IARV refers 'to a human response level below which a specified significant injury is considered unlikely to occur for the given size individual. Being below all the lARVs does not assure that significant injury could not occur since lARVs are not specified and the dummy is not instrumented to measure all responses that are associated with ail possible types of injuries. Further, exceeding an IARV does not necessarily mean that a person would be injured if exposed to the collision being simulated since the lARVs are lower bounds for injury thresholds." Laboratory Testing of Armrests - Quasi-Static Hemicylindrical Ram Tests for Initial Sorting Purposes To determine whether a quasi-static test could be used as an initial sorting test, a large variety of armrests and con- stant pressure research "padding" materials were tested on the Tinius-Olsen tensile test machine, using the 150 mm diameter aluminum hemicylinder as a ram (Figure 3). The armrest/trim panel assemblies were compressed to approximately 19 mm of the surrounding trim panel or top of the machine table and a force-deflection curve plotted. Particularly when the trim panel was present, the deflec- tion measurement could not be made with a high degree of accuracy, varying by about 6 mm when measured by different operators. Even when these possible inaccura- 3204</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3 -- Quasi-static test of armrest assembly on a universal testing machine Table II Tinius-Olsen Quasi-Static Test Results* Cylindrical Ram -- Approximate Mid-Seat Position Load at 25 mm** Load at 25 mm** Armrest (kN) Armrest (kN) A 11.8 K 7.6 B 12.0 L 1.3 C 5.8 M 9.1 D 7.1 N 8.9 E 4.4 0 10.2 F 15.1 P 12.0 G 1.3 Q 15.6 H 7.3 R 5.3 I 4.0 S 6.7 ~ J 15.6 T 12.0 * Not necessarily in same order as in Table I ** When armrest is compressed to 25 mm above the test machine base plate. cies are considered, these tests gave loads at about the 25 mm height (i.e., height above the reaction surface) that varied by a factor of at least 12 (Table II), indicating that this test procedure probably could directionally discrimi- nate gross differences in armrest design. However, there was random correlation to BIOSID results (below) at low loads, probably related to how rapidly the force-deflection curve was rising at or near to the approximate 25 mm height, and the effect of viscoelastic materials in dynamic testing. In fact, since the samples were compressed to about 19 mm, it was possible to observe part of this force rise as some of the samples became essentially solid. It also was postulated that a simple sorting test using the above cylindrical ram might not be necessary if the BIOSID test could be kept sufficiently simple. If this ram test is used to sort armrest assemblies, it is recommended that the deflection be continued to about 1 5 mm above the reaction surface and the sorting simply be based on the maximum load being "high" (above 3.0 kN) at any collapse point to about 20 mm remaining height, and not further tested, or "low" (below 3.0 kN) and recom- mended for BIOSID testing. The shape of the overall curve may be of interest to armrest designers, but is not important for this sorting procedure. Laboratory Testing of Armrests -- Initial Dynamic Test Using BIOSID A dynamic test procedure was devised using the BIOSID dummy, which indicated armrest intrusion into the dummy's abdomen. A BIOSID dummy was seated upright at the end of Ford's mini-sled so the ribcage in both front and side view was vertical. A fixture was mounted to the sled, containing a small flat, vertical aluminum plate which supported the armrest and a portion of the trim panel. The top surface of the armrest was at the level of the top of the upper abdominal rib (Figure 4). The carriage, when rigidized to minimize plate deflection, had a total mass of 49 kg. It was propelled towards the dummy before reach- ing a coasting speed of 6.7 m/s. The BIOSID was free to move laterally upon impact. Figure 4 - Initial BIOSID testing with armrest mounted to a small plate Many of the same types of armrests tested for the dynam- ic ram test were tested with the BIOSID under the above conditions. Maximum abdominal rib deflections ranged between 33 and 72 mm (Table III). While the data gener- ated in these tests were directionally similar to those obtained in the experimental crash tests mentioned earlier, the crash conditions - dummy-to-inner-panel velocity profile, thoracic support, pelvic support -- were not similar to the crash tests. A more generic solution was sought which would simply evaluate armrest assemblies on both a comparative and absolute basis. Laboratory Testing of Armrests -- BIOSID Delta-Deflection Test After more developmental tests using the BIOSID dummy, a first generation test procedure was devised which ap- 3205</page><page sequence="5">Table III Dynamic Laboratory Mini-Sled Testing Using BIOSID Dummy - Maximum Abdominal Rib Deflection Results Max.

May be compared directly with Table IV. pears to assess the potential for an armrest to deflect the BIOSID dummy's abdominal ribs, while giving credit to any pelvic contact points below the armrest, or any thoracic contact points above the armrest. Work is continuing on a second-generation "systems" test that will include more of the door assembly. As above, a BIOSID dummy was seated upright at the end of Ford's mini-sled so the ribcage in both front and side view was vertical. A fixture was mounted to the sled, containing a vertical, rigid, flat aluminum plate high enough to fully contact the BIOSID's top thoracic rib, but not the shoulder rib. The plate extended low enough to completely cover the pelvic acetabulum foam plug and to reach to the bottom attachments of any trim panel. The plate was as wide as possible to still fit between the rails of the mini-sled. The trim panel and/or armrest was mounted to this plate so that the top surface of the arm- rest was at the level of the top of the upper abdominal rib. The carriage, with a total mass of 49 kg, was propelled towards the dummy before reaching a coasting speed of 6.7 m/s. The deflection of all five ribs was measured, as well as pelvic loading. Data Analysis to Determine Armrest Effect Since this dynamic test imparts considerable energy to the dummy, the flat plate alone will compress the dummy's ribs to a considerable degree. This compression is not armrest-related and therefore must be subtracted out of the equation as follows: • Examine the data curves for anomalies. • Record and average the three thoracic rib maximum deflections (ignoring 1-2 ms "noise" spikes). The differences between thoracic ribs should be less than 10 mm if the dummy's ribcage is vertical at impact (unless there is a definite trim panel projection that is the cause of ribcage localized deflection). Engineering judgment then should be used to determine "average" ribcage deflection. • Record the maximum deflection of the two abdominal ribs, ignoring noise spikes as above. • Subtract the average thorax deflection from the highest deflection recorded for the abdominal ribs. This num- ber approximately indicates the maximum delta-deflec- tion caused by the armrest alone, but is an unknown indication of the relative likelihood of an armrest being involved in a compression-type injury to the ribcage or internal organs. • Compare to the desired delta-deflection biomechanic- ally-based provisional reference number. Currently, approximately 20 mm is being used as a goal since that seems to correlate conservatively with the pub- lished 39 mm Injury Assessment Reference Value in a typical FMVSS 214 side impact crash test, as seen in Figure 5. This figure shows the correlation of the BIOSID abdominal rib deflection in full-vehicle side impact crash tests and the BIOSID delta-deflection values from the laboratory tests on the respective door trim/armrest assemblies.

This BIOSID delta-deflection test and its analysis are shown schematically in Figure 6 and some test results are shown in Table IV. The Table III and IV data are directly comparable. It should be pointed out that the above-mentioned 39 mm abdominal rib deflection is the peak biomechanical goal for the BIOSID abdominal ribs in a crash test. That value does not necessarily apply to the maximum rib deflection obtained during the previously-described initial BIOSID test or the currently-described delta-deflection test. In each case the 24 km/h test velocity is somewhat arbitrary in severity and the door's velocity-time profile is not matched. 3206</page><page sequence="6">~ 1 I Armrest Assembly Evaluation Test Set-up Measurement and Calculation Using BIOSID Test Dummy of Delta-Deflection (A = Aa - At) BIOSID dummy BIOSID dummy L /*Q* n Thoracic rib deflection due I II I n II to the dynamic impact of x j ¿ / flat P'ate and trim panel ~ / f- Armrest top aligns with top ~ .

Laboratory Testing of Armrests -- Tests with the EUROSID-1 Dummy Other tests were conducted using the EUROSID-1 "Euro- pean" side impact dummy (Figure 7) in place of the BIOSID. The EUROSID-1 dummy has thoracic ribs like the BIOSID, but indicates abdominal loading by a series of three laterally-facing load cells deep within the abdominal cavity (Figure 8). One load cell is towards the back of the dummy and faces partly towards the dummy's side and back. The center load cell faces purely laterally. The front load cell faces partly to the front and partly laterally. The abdominal cavity then is filled with a weighted foam "abdominal sac." The three load cell outputs are added with respect to time and the peak load reading indicates the peak abdominal force, which is limited to 2.5 kN in expected European regulations. But this is an indirect way of indicating abdominal injury potential. It is believed that the evidence indicates that abdominal injury potential is more related to ribcage displacement or the peak of the instantaneous velocity of penetration times the displace- ment (V*C) -- neither of which can be indicated when testing with the EUROSID-1 dummy. Further, it was discovered after the EUROSID-1 tests were completed that the abdominal load cells that came with the dummy could give very erroneous loads, depending on the vertical location of the load input. New, Denton Inc. load cells(14) (which can be removed and calibrated) are now available for this dummy. 3207</page><page sequence="7">Figure 7 - EUROSID-1 dummy chest and abdomen Figure 8 - EUROSID-1 internal abdominal load cell array There did not appear to be a good correlation between BIOSID delta-deflection and EUROSID-1 load in these tests when the EUROSID-1 indicated loads were low. For example, in three matched tests, the EUROSID-1 abdomi- nal loads were 1.24, 1.38 and 1.42 kN, but the corre- sponding BIOSID delta-deflection values were 22, 5 and 17 mm respectively. The respective Viscous Criterion (V*C) were 0.83, 0.58 and 0.75 m/s. Tests with the new Denton load cells might have indicated better correlation, but the load cells were not available at that time. Three Types of Armrests Current armrests come in three general types - integral with the trim panel; integral but with an add-on pad; and fully add-on type. Each type has its reasons for existence, and each requires unique solutions. One possible solution for an add-on armrest was developed. This concept uses a collapsible metal insert imbedded within a foam sub- strate, covered by a slush-molded skin. Such a design is shown in Figure 9. When the initial prototype was delta- deflection tested, it proved too stiff: the foam became rigid Figure 9 - A schematic of an experimental collapsible structure for an add-on armrest too soon. After considerable work a way was found to keep most of the foam from penetrating behind the col- lapsible metal structure and this considerably improved its delta-deflection performance. Whether this could be done consistently in production is an open issue. This illus- trates the difficulty in designing an armrest to meet the multiple goals of the team without the delta-deflection test to act as a guide. For integral armrests, trim panel material, shape, thick- ness, ribbing, strength-reduced points, even pelvic side impact padding in any portion of the armrest area, need to be considered together, as must cycling durability. Other Test Requirements An armrest must function as a comfortable rest for the elbow while driving or riding; is often used as a door pull; and is often abused particularly by children who stand on it. The door also may be slammed against some interior obstruction, so the armrest must also withstand consider- able compressive load without damage. The object of our program is to considerably lessen the compressive lateral load, yet maintain reasonable durability. The Development of the First Generation Lower Lateral Force Armrests Ford Motor Co. has established design targets for all future door panel armrests with an objective that new designs will not exceed the 20 mm delta-deflection target previously mentioned in the laboratory dynamic BIOSID test. In addition, armrests must be able to withstand a 445 N static lateral load without crushing. These targets, when added to the existing armrest requirements are expected to provide durable, biomechanically compliant armrests. Furthermore, Ford has an implementation plan to phase in these lower lateral force armrest designs in all of its cars and trucks. The thickness of the ABS plastic substrate on one type of 3208</page><page sequence="8">Figure 10 -- Cross section schematic of a shear wall collapsible element in a lower lateral force armrest design armrest was reduced from 2.5 to 2.0 mm, and a 1 mm shear step was designed in the horizontal surface of the polypropylene plastic carrier for the foam pad of another type of armrest. Also, the ABS door panel substrate underneath the horizontal portion of the foam pad assem- bly was voided to produce more lateral compliance. Fig- ures 10 and 1 1 show typical cross-sections of lower lateral force armrests before and after impact. The BIOSID Abdominal Displacement vs. EUROSID-1 Abdominal Force in AAMA Matched Crash Tests of Ponti- ac 6000 Vehicles The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) conducted a series of 12 full-vehicle side impact crash tests(15) at General Motors during 1990 to determine whether the BIOSID dummy produced significantly differ- ent responses than the NHTSA SID dummy. To complete the evaluation of side impact dummies, AAMA undertook another six vehicle crash test program(16) using the EUROSID-1 dummy with the new Denton, Inc. abdominal load cells(14) which accurately indicate abdominal loading in the dummy. These crash tests were conducted by Ford Motor Company in 1993. The test vehicles were 1990 model year Pontiac 6000 with and without padding added to the interior door trim. Figure 12 presents the correlation of full-vehicle crash tests between the BIOSID abdominal rib deflection measurements and EUROSID-1 total abdom- inal load. The correlation coefficient (r) from the linear regression is 0.96. These data are based on the AAMA testing and laboratory abdominal component testing. Finite Element Math Modeling to Aid Future Armrest De- velopment To improve design efficiencies, a Finite Element (FE) model is being developed to provide engineers and de- signers with the static load-bearing and dynamic crush characteristics of armrests early in the design cycle before prototyping. Being able to predict the performance of armrests early in the design cycle will improve timing and significantly reduce the number of laboratory tests re- quired to validate designs and materials. FE modeling will be the tool of choice in the future for designing lower lateral force armrests. This tool is targeted to be available for all suppliers developing armrests for Ford Motor Co. by late 1995/early 1996. 3209</page><page sequence="9">Figure 11 - Cross section schematic of a notched collapsible element in a lower lateral force armrest design BIOSID/EUROSID-1 CORRELATION • 3 -T ^ ^ P» ! § ^ A A MA S Data &lt; ■ - - o ■= z Door 3 ~ es ♦ ^ I® "O ^ ^ s o Door 2 T o i ^ ^ û ^ ^ ^ co ^ 2 ♦ R2 = 0.922 5 n Door 1 m w h i i i 1 0 20 40 60 80 BIOSID Max. Abdomen Rib Deflection (mm) Figure 12 -- Correlation in full vehicle crash tests between the BIOSID maximum abdominal rib deflection and the EUROSID-1 total abdominal load CONCLUSIONS 1. The successful development of the BIOSID delta-de- flection test procedure has made it possible to begin phasing in lower lateral force armrests in all Ford cars and trucks. 2. The SID dummy does not indicate abdominal injury potential; in fact, we believe the exclusive use of this dummy in side impact research and development may lead in the opposite direction than optimal, as far as armrest stiffness is concerned. 3. The BIOSID dummy realistically indicates armrest lateral stiffness and therefore is the best tool currently available to assess armrest lateral stiffness in relation to abdominal injury potential. 4. A delta-deflection of 20 mm in the BIOSID delta-de- flection test conservatively correlates with 39 mm in a BIOSID full- vehicle test. 5. The BIOSID dummy may be used effectively to help develop lower lateral force armrests. 3210</page><page sequence="10">6. The EUROSID-1 dummy also can be used to help indicate abdominal injury potential, although the injury potential has to be inferred from internal loading in- stead of direct compression and Viscous Criterion measurements. 7. In laboratory and full scale testing of the EUROSID-1 dummy with the new abdominal load cells, 1.8 kN measured by the abdominal load cells correlates with 39 mm BIOSID abdominal rib deflection. 8. Finite Element math modeling is expected to become the tool of choice in designing lower lateral force arm- rests.
