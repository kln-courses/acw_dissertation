<plain_text><page sequence="1">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK IN EARLY BRONZE AGE ANATOLIA Part I By JAK YAKAR Tel-Aviv University The past few years have witnessed a surge of interest in the development of ancient metallurgy in the Near East, and in particular, in Anatolia.' Most of the work done in this field however, with the exception of analytical studies conducted in laboratories and geological surveys, hardly goes beyond the re-examination of known historical, archaeological and geological data. The results, as can be expected, are derived mainly from the re-evaluation of previous conclusions on the development of early technologies and the emergence of major production centres in the Aegean, Anatolia and Eastern Mediterranean. Until a few years ago the origins of southeast European metallurgy were thought to be in northwest Anatolia. This traditional thesis of diffusion from the Troad to the Aegean and into the Balkans had rested on the chronological argument that the Chalcolithic cultures of Old Europe were contemporary with the EB I in Anatolia and the Aegean.2 The "diffusionists" lost substantial support for their theory when the chronological priority of Old European cultures based on tree-ring calibrated C-14 dates over the more traditional Near Eastern chronology was generally accepted. Some scholars feel that one way around this "hurdle" is to subscribe to a rather arbitrary chronological scheme which assigns ultra-high radiocarbon dates for the EBA cultures of Anatolia and other regions of the Near East, including Egypt.3 There is a consensus today among most scholars dealing with ancient metallurgy that this subject should be treated free of "unsubstanti- ated" theories such as "diffusion" or "independent innovation" Muhly regards the latter thesis, which emphasizes the local origins of technology developed by indigenous cultures, as an extreme reaction by anti-diffusionists against the notion that every new style and technique was introduced from the outside by a specific group of people (Muhly 1980a:30). He maintains that technology was transferred by long-distance trade and not by colonization. To stress this point, he argues that the speed and the extent of the spread of arsenical copper metallurgy in the third millennium B.C. cannot be explained in terms of a series of isolated, independent developments. To claim this, in his view, is not to believe, e.g., in colonists from Syros having established themselves at Los Millares in Spain. Muhly also rejects the possibility that the spread of metallurgy in the third millennium B.C. could be linked to the migrations of ethnic groups such as the Hurrians or Indo-Europeans. In accordance with his personal conviction he states that "there is no evidence to 'For some recent publications see: Wertime and Muhly 1980; de Jesus 1980; Waldbaum 1978; Franklin, Olin and Wertime 1978; Maddin, Wheeler and Muhly 1977; Eaton and McKerrel 1976; Muhly 1976; Branigan 1974 and Muhly 1973; Gale and Gale 1981 and Yener 1983. 2However the radiocarbon chronology places the Tiszapolgar, VinEa, Gumelnita and Cucuteni/Tripolye cultures firmly in the fourth millennium B.c. For an evaluation of early metallurgy in the Troad see: Barker 1977. 3The chronologically relevant evidence from Anatolia including the more recent radiocarbon dates from the EB levels at Demircih6yiik (personal communication from Prof. Korfmann) do not support the ultra-high dates in the chronological scheme proposed by de Jesus (1980: 357). See also Yakar 1979; 1981b.</page><page sequence="2">60 ANATOLIAN STUDIES support the existence of any specialized group of metalworkers in the Early Bronze Age, and it has not been possible to substantiate any theory of migration or colonization at this time" (Muhly 1980a:29). As far as Anatolia is concerned, however, Muhly seems to have overlooked the archaeological evidence which cannot be misconstrued; the immigration of ethnic groups since the fourth millennium B.C. and their consequential involvement in the transformation of the EB cultures.4 I agree with Barker (1977) that it is far more important to understand the context in which real metallurgy developed rather than pinpointing the first use of copper and other metals (in their native form) as a trinket. But it is essential that the study of cultural context avoid the use of unsubstantiated chronological frameworks. Also it should include all the available data relating to changes in social organizations and settlement patterns during the EBA. Otherwise, the picture one gets is likely to be a distorted one as is the case with some of the conclusions arrived at by de Jesus regarding the development of prehistoric mining and metallurgy in Anatolia (de Jesus 1980). His ultra-high dates, which derive from Mellaart's and Easton's high chronological schemes, for the beginning of Beycesultan XL and Troy Ia makes the latter, and to a certain extent the former, the leading workshops in Anatolia since the second half of the fifth millennium B.C.5 Strangely enough, de Jesus considers Troy Ia to have been founded at least five hundred years earlier than Alishar 19M, and contemporary with Mersin XIV (Early Uruk). The period between c. 4300-3500 B.C. in his opinion is a crucial phase in Anatolia's metallurgical development largely because of his assumption that a certain amount of development in the field of metallurgy had to have taken place prior to the EB II, in other words, before the mid-fourth millennium B.C. (de Jesus 1980:147). His so-called "few indices" supporting this thesis include artifacts from the EB III cemetery at Kalinkaya in central Anatolia which he erroneously dates to the EB I period (de Jesus 1980:147). The tombs that Temizer discovered at this site north of Alaca Hoyiuk produced funeral gifts similar in shape and meaning, although not in size, to those found at the Alaca Hoyiik royal tombs which are dated to the second half of the third millennium B.c. (Alkim 1976:45; Mellink 1972:169).6 De Jesus' assessment that tin-bronze becomes known in Anatolia during 4300-3500 B.C. may not be entirely correct because it overlooks the following facts: (1) At least two of the three tin-bronze artifacts from Mersin's Chalcolithic levels are not reliably stratified. These are a stamp seal (Esin-17871) containing 2-6% Sn, 1-2% As and 1-55% Pb, and a toggle-pin (Esin-17884) containing 1-3% Sn and 1-15% As. They are attributed by Esin to levels XVII- XVI and XIV-XIII respectively, in other words, to the Ubaid period.' The third 4For an evaluation of the proto-Indo-European impact on early Anatolian cultures see: Yakar 1981a; Winn 1981 and Mellaart 1981. 1I have tried to demonstrate in Yakar 1975; 1976 and 1979 that Troy I and the corresponding levels at Beycesultan do not represent the early phases of the EB I culture in the west. Troy I could have been founded in the final phase of the EB I. Once the Demircihdyilk material is thoroughly studied it may throw some light on the chronological problems of Troy I and the earlier cultures in the Troad. I still prefer to consider Troy I as representing mainly the EB II period in the Troad. 6The EBA tombs contained small openwork disks, animal figurines, pins, bracelets, weapons and other artifacts. These tomb gifts are not as sophisticated as those from the Alaca H6yilk graves. 7Following the destruction of Level XVI fortress, Mersin was re-built a few times during the "late" Chalcolithic period. However these settlements, XV, XIV and XIII, were found to be seriously disturbed by circular grain pits of later period. This phenomenon</page><page sequence="3">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 61 tin-bronze object, an awl (Esin-17882) containing 2-1% Sn and 1-25% As is attributed by Esin to level XIV. The locus of this awl was not registered by Garstang and it cannot be considered, in my opinion, reliable data just because shapewise it does not betray the Chalcolithic types.8 It is indeed important to note that the MBA levels at Mersin (IX-X) produced similar ternary alloys (Esin 1969:144-6). (2) The three tin-bronze objects from Alishar H6yiik (nos. 2465 with 2-49/3-33% Sn, 1082 with 3-7% tin and 1801 with 6-05% tin) come from levels 13- 12 (von der Osten 1937:92-3; Buchholz 1967: Tabelle 11) which are dated to the later part of the Early Bronze Age I period (Mellink 1965:126). (3) Of the seven analyses available from Troy I, there is only one tin-bronze (A-619 in de Jesus 1980:134). Since there is no chronological justification to consider the beginning of Troy I earlier than Alishar 19M, nor even contemporary with it, the evidence for the early use of tin at Troy in the mid-fourth millennium B.C. should be reconsidered. I share Mellink's view that Troy I was established at the onset of the EB II period (Mellink 1965:126), or at the earliest, towards the end of the EB I (Yakar 1979:53-7). (4) The possibility that the tin bangle found at Thermi I (Branigan 1974:215), which is contemporary with the earliest phases of Troy I, is of antimony should be seriously considered (Renfrew 1967:13, n. 151). Also the stratigraphical distribution of the tin-bronzes at Thermi (Branigan 1974:72, 147) in levels contemporary with Troy I and II makes it difficult to accept the view that tin was introduced to western Anatolia and the eastern Aegean at an early date. I think the assertion by de Jesus that "the rest of the Near East does not appear up to the same technological level of EB I Anatolian cultures" (de Jesus 1980:151) is, as I shall try to demonstrate in this paper, rather misleading. It is a well known fact that with the progress of time, some prehistoric settlements developed quicker than others resulting in regional cultures showing manifestations and characteristics that, although contemporary, are by no means uniform. This situation is partly responsible for the diverging views in Anatolian chronology. In certain population groups in Anatolia, the changes in the social structure (e.g. from village headman or tribal chief to regional monarch who exercised his authority over his domain by creating certain privileged groups within the settled communities) were more rapid. Consequently some settlements greatly increased their density of population in which specialized workers and craftsmen played an important part in the development of their communities, cultures and economies. Therefore it is very important to establish the "real" chronological setting of the various cultures before advancing new theories concerning the role of particular settlements or regions in the development of metal industries in Anatolia. puts the question of reliability of the stratigraphical evidence in doubt. Sandwiched between rather decadent survivals of the Ubaid period ware were some features suggesting intrusive material culture of the Jemdet-Nasr period (Lloyd 1956: 84). Chronologically more disturbing is the fact that some wares of Troy I shape were found closely associated with the Late Chalcolithic material at Mersin XV-XIII (Lloyd 1956: 84-5). In my opinion we could safely assume now that the so-called Troy I shapes in Mersin Late Chalcolithic strata are intrusive from level XII. Another possibility is that they are imports from the Late Chalcolithic settlements in the southern Anatolian plateau. The dark-burnished white-painted and the white-filled incised sherds of the late fourth millennium B.C. such as those found at Can Hasan I or Kuruqay H6yiik could be confused with sherds belonging to wares of Troy I date. 8The shapes of fourth and third millennia awls from Anatolia are so similar that an arbitrary typological division cannot be a substitute for more reliable chronological criteria (e.g. pottery).</page><page sequence="4">62 ANATOLIAN STUDIES My objections to a high chronological framework based solely on tree-ring calibrated C-14 dates derive from my views that: (a) radiocarbon dating is still plagued by uncertainties9; (b) Troy's chronology should be assessed within the relative chronological system of Anatolia which is rather well synchronized with that of Mesopotamia and Syria (Yakar 1981b:5; 1979); (c) to substitute southeast European C-14 dates for the relative Anatolian dates for Troy I-V is certainly not the most logical solution to stabilize the EBA Anatolian chronology. My approach on this issue, which is still a much debated one, is to follow a chronology which is linked to the traditional chronologies of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Syria. This chronological framework does not reject the incorporating of calibrated radio- carbon dates, provided they are Anatolian and their relative accuracy checked by an improved procedure I proposed not long ago.'0 I. The Proto-Urban Period Late Chalcolithic-EB I; c. 3800-2800 B.C. As most Anatolian archaeologists will admit, the dividing line between the Late Chalcolithic and the EB I periods in Anatolia is not always established according to changes observed in the socio-economic or settlement patterns. The main criterion used to separate the two periods derives from changes in the local pottery cultures. In this long period, which is partly contemporary with the Proto- literate and ED I in North Syria and Mesopotamia, most regions of Anatolia were being settled by groups of different ancestry to that of the Early Chalcolithic Anatolians. Further confirmation for this development comes from Kurugay, a prehistoric mound situated 15 km. southwest of Burdur. The farming settlements of the Hacilar I culture were abandoned after suffering destruction at the hands of newcomers from the north. The new "Late Chalcolithic" culture in the southwest of Anatolia is rather inferior when compared to the one it replaced (Duru 1983:48). Approximately at this time, during the first half of the fourth millennium B.C., previously uninhabited regions of northern Anatolia (e.g. the Bafra plain) were being settled by farming communities whose origins are difficult to trace back to Anatolia. The population movements which affected the demographic structure and cultural character of so many regions in Anatolia did not have much impact on the Chalcolithic settlements in eastern Anatolia. These were more exposed to influences emanating from Transcaucasia, Mesopotamia and Syria. In fact, important cultural and socio-economic transformations started to take place in the settlements along the Euphrates valley, in Malatya and Elazig in the second half of the fourth millennium B.C. The expansion of the merchant colonies by Mesopotamians along the upper reaches of the Euphrates north of Syria started the rather long process of urbanization in southeastern Anatolia. However, these Mesopotamian colonies were abandoned soon after the end of the Uruk IV period, and with the departure of the merchants came the sudden interruption of the 9Some of the deficiencies in C-14 dates are attributed to environmental causes and laboratory procedures which are not always fool-proof. I'It should be possible to obtain more reliable radiocarbon dates by cross-checking the accuracy of a few pre-calibrated dates using an ultra-sensitive mass-spectrometer (Yakar 1981b). Next, a cross-laboratory system affording the use of more than one calibration chart based on the Damon and MASCA tables could provide a reliable estimate of statistical uncertainty of the conversion necessary for precise date determination. Finally, a good averaging method should be used, preferably the one propsed by Long and Rippeteau (1974: 205-15), to decrease the standard deviation in the average value.</page><page sequence="5">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 63 urbanization process in the Keban-Malatya region. Since this process did not actually start in the rest of Anatolia before the end of the Early Bronze Age I, this period of rather long duration may best be described as "proto-urban" (Yakar 1981b). My re-appraisal of the nature and significance of the local metal industries in proto-urban Anatolia takes into consideration the following, archaeologically well-established, facts: a. The Late Chalcolithic cultures which displaced and/or succeeded the Early Chalcolithic cultures in Anatolia in the west and south-central plateau have "northern affinities" (Yakar 1981a:95). These can easily be traced to the Danube, the Balkans and Thrace. In fact, the earliest contacts between the Old European cultures and Anatolia may be dated to the fifth millennium B.C.11 b. Elements of the Ezero-Cernavoda-Cotofeni complexes that caused the disintegration of the southeast European cultural horizon of Karanovo VI, Kodjadermen-Gumelnita, Krivodol-Salcuta, Cucuteni, Tripolye and Vinia Ploinik reached parts of western, central and northern Anatolia as a result of pressures exerted by "Kurgan" invaders (Yakar 1976; 1981a:96). c. The population shifts into Anatolia cannot be limited to one particular phase nor from the west only. There are many indications in the "hybrid" character of the cultures of this period that they are the result of amalgamation of southeast European, Transcaucasian and Anatolian traits with some features of nomadic cultures as well. In this context it is important to remember that the Chalcolithic cultures of southeast Europe had highly developed metallurgical traditions unparalleled in Anatolia or in the Aegean.12 I suggest therefore that if archaeologists can discern certain cultural traits in the art, pottery traditions and architecture as being of "non-Anatolian affiliation", they should accept the view that "Anatolian metallurgy" too did not develop entirely autonomously in this period. A. WESTERN ANATOLIA Our information about this period derives from three sites; Kuru;ay, Bey- cesultan and Kusura. Troy I may have been founded towards the end of the EB I in Anatolia, but as I have tried to demonstrate elsewhere (Yakar 1979), its culture does not represent the early stages of the EB I in western Anatolia. Therefore, the material of Troy I will be evaluated in the next chapter. I IAmong the significant finds at Demircihdyiik are sherds of imported Dudegti and Karanovo I-II type wares. Despite the fact that these sherds are unstratified, they provide the earliest evidence for contact between the Danube, the Balkans and Anatolia (Yakar 1981a: 96). '2The representative types of metal tools of southeast European Chalcolithic cultures originated genetically from contemporary bone and stone tools. The intrinsic types for the chronological horizon of Karanovo VI, Gumelnita, Cucuteni and Tripolye, which is much earlier than the Troy I horizon in western Anatolia, are composed of awls, wedges, wedge- shaped axes, adzes, axe-hammers and axe-adzes (Panayotov 1977). The level of sophistica- tion of the Balkan metal industries in the Late Chalcolithic period has been further revealed by the gold objects and jewellery discovered in the Varna cemetery of the Gumelnita period (Gimbutas 1977; Renfrew 1979: 378-81). The Aibunar copper mines near Stara Zagora in Bulgaria seem to have supplied the copper used for the production of some of the tools found in the Varna cemetery (Gimbutas 1977: 51). Evidence of mining is also found in the copper deposits of Rudna Glava in the Vinca period. However, the Aibunar mines produced more sophisticated methods such as cutting trenches as deep as 10 m. below the surface.</page><page sequence="6">64 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Kurupay H6yiigu: The stratigraphy of Kuruqay provides an uninterrupted cultural sequence between the Early Chalcolithic and EB II periods in the southwest (Duru 1983). The Late Chalcolithic settlement of level 6 with its fortification wall and numerous architectural phases is the largest excavated in Anatolia. Some 2000 m2 area excavated so far exposed many buildings with mud- brick walls built on stone foundations. These rectangular and mostly one-room houses were free-standing in large open spaces and along alleys or streets (Duru 1983:82). Commenting on the pottery repertory of Kurugay 6-4, Duru considers this culture as being earlier than the "Late Chalcolithic" culture of Beycesultan (XL-XX). Although he dates Kurugay level 6 to the mid-fifth millennium B.C., simply because it was founded immediately on top of the Early Chalcolithic ruins of level 7, the few available calibrated radiocarbon dates may suggest a much younger date for the end of the Early Chalcolithic period at Kuruqay (Duru 1983:47). As for metal artifacts found in the Late Chalcolithic levels, Duru observes that "the metallurgy consists of one of the more developed aspects of the Late Chalcolithic culture of Kuruqay" (Duru 1983:49). Some 30 metal objects found so far and which include an adze, an axe, a knife, a lance head and more than 25 pins and awls, have no similar counterparts in the older Early Chalcolithic settlement. I agree with Duru's assessment that the metallurgy observed at Kuruqay should have originated elsewhere. Chemical analyses indicate that unalloyed copper was used by the local smiths. The presence of 1-19 Zn in the copper adze (Duru 1983:47) may be interpreted as an early attempt in deliberate alloying. The great differences between the Early and Late Chalcolithic cultures of Kurugay might be due to the different origins of the inhabitants of the 7th and 6th settlements which could also explain the sudden change of metal technology (Duru 1983:49). Beycesultan "Late Chalcolithic": The recent excavations at Kuruqay H-6yiigii have confirmed beyond any doubt that the dates proposed by de Jesus for Beycesultan levels XL-XX are far too high (Duru 1980:70; de Jesus 1980:357). Level XXXIV which produced the metal hoard (Lloyd and Mellaart 1962:280-3) should be dated to the second half of the fourth millennium B.C. (Mellink 1965:114, 125-6). I agree with de Jesus that the small amount of metalwork from the early levels should not mislead us into concluding that the metal industries at this site were underdeveloped. The majority of the objects in the metal hoard were made of unalloyed copper. However, low arsenical coppers were already being used by the local smiths here to produce certain objects (Esin 1969:11775, 11781 in 129-30). As for the silver ring found in the hoard, if it was not made of native silver then one can assume that cupellation was already being practised at this time in western Anatolia. Kusura A-EB I: The material representing the proto-urban period comes from the cemetery. Therefore a more precise chronological attribution of the metalwork within this period is not possible. Here too, the majority of the metal artifacts were made of unalloyed copper. But it seems that tin-bronze technology was introduced at this site towards the end of EB I (Lamb 1936:64; A-690 in de Jesus 1980:132, 350). The range of metal objects at Kusura is limited to pins and needles which could have been produced locally, or as suggested by de Jesus acquired from elsewhere. As long as the settlement to which this cemetery belonged is not located and then excavated there is no way of knowing whether the early inhabitants were in any way connected with metal production.</page><page sequence="7">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 65 B. CENTRAL AND NORTH-CENTRAL ANATOLIA Alishar Hiyiik 19M-12 M: Levels 19-15 M are dated by Mellink to the Uruk period in North Mesopotamia/Syria (Mellink 1965:126). Levels 14-12 are con- sidered contemporary with the second part of the proto-urban period, in other words, the EB I. The repertory of metal objects is limited to awls, pins and trinkets made of copper, silver, lead and tin-bronze. It should be stressed, however, that tin-bronzes are few and found in the late EB I (levels 13-12 M) (Buchholz 1967: Tabelle 11; Esin 1969; de Jesus 1980:128). Some artifacts are made of low arsenical coppers (Esin 1969: 17743, 17745 in 124). On the basis of available evidence and the absence of moulds from these or later third millennium B.C. levels, it is difficult to judge whether the proto-urban settlement had its local industry or relied on outside sources (e.g. itinerant smiths).13 Biiyiik Giilliicek: This site produced two flat-axes made of copper containing less than 1% As (Esin 1969:130: 6755-6). These objects may be dated to the last quarter of the fourth millennium B.C. Ikiztepe II: Level III with its 8 architectural phases represents the Late Chalcolithic culture in the Bafra plain. It is now clear that the people who introduced this culture were the first to have settled in north-central Anatolia some time in the late fifth or early fourth millennium B.C. (Alkim 1983:180). In the last quarter of the fourth millennium B.C., according to C 14 dates from level II (Alkim 1981:150), this culture was superseded by one with a different pottery repertory. This culture is also found in the EB I settlements in north-central Anatolia (Yakar 1975). Commenting on the cultural characteristics of the material remains of level III at Ikiztepe, Alkim observed certain similarities between the pottery of southeast European Chalcolithic cultures and those of ikiztepe Late Chalcolithic levels. It seems that the inhabitants of this Pontic village possessed a metalworking tradition when they first reached the Black Sea coast. Fragments of metal objects such as pins, rings and awls found in almost all the Chalcolithic phases at ikiztepe are further proof that the metallurgy of this region too had its origins elsewhere. The metal analyses published recently suggest that most of the objects were made of unalloyed copper (Ozbal 1981:112; Kunq 1981:118-19). However, two of the metal objects analysed contained small amounts of arsenic which suggests that the metalsmiths of Ikiztepe were already familiar with copper-arsenic alloy (Kunq 1981).14 C. EASTERN ANATOLIA Excavations in southeastern Anatolia are producing important archaeological discoveries comparable to those made in the Keban in the last decade. It now seems that the "colonial" settlements of the Uruk period were not limited to northern Syria only. Mesopotamian settlers expanded their network of "colonies" in the direction of the upper Euphrates valley, in the metal-rich zone extending between Urfa and Keban. They were thus in a geographically ideal position to provide their "mother" cities with smelted copper, arsenic-rich copper, silver and even with finished metal artifacts needed in the south. The silver deposits in the Keban (Ozbal &amp; Yener 1983:80) and the rich copper belt south of Elazlg (Kun9 &amp; Gul 1983:97) must have been partially exploited by prospectors of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. The Uruk "colony" at Norquntepe had set up a most 13According to de Jesus (1980: 128) it is evident that Alishar is not a purveyor of advanced metallurgical technology, but a recipient of it. '4The analytical study of the material from Ikiztepe is not complete.</page><page sequence="8">66 ANATOLIAN STUDIES elaborate metal industry which could have supplied both the local demand and export orders (Hauptmann 1976:56-7; Zwicker 1977:13). Nevertheless, the chang- ing ethno-political situation in eastern Anatolia and northern Syria during the Protoliterate c period, led to the dismantlement of the merchant colonies and to a change in the progress of cultural development (Yakar and Salzmann 1979:37; Moorey 1982:15). These changes must have been caused by the westward expansion of the Transcaucasian culture. While the reasons for this population shift at this time are not entirely clear, they may have been caused by movements of pastoralists, tentatively called proto-Indo-Europeans (Yakar 1981a:103). The proto-Indo-European presence in eastern Anatolia towards the end of the fourth millennium B.C. could be inferred from the use of mounds for burials which recall those found in the Kurgan cultures in Transcaucasia (Winn 1981:113-15). Norfuntepe: At this important site now submerged under the waters of the Keban Dam Reservoir, Hauptmann exposed a continuous sequence of occupation since the Chalcolithic period (Hauptmann 1982). The arrival of the Mesopotamian merchants during the Uruk IV period seems to have affected, at least to some extent, the demographic and the socio-economic structure in the Keban-Malatya region. It should be stressed that southeastern Anatolians of the early fourth millennium B.C. were composed of farmers and pastoralists of central Anatolian, Transcaucasian and north Syrian stock. The Uruk IV settlement at Norquntepe was only partly excavated (Hauptmann 1982:28-31). Some of the mudbrick houses, built according to Mesopotamian architectural tradition, produced smelt- ing furnaces, heaps of copper ore, chunks of slag, fragments of burned clay and metal objects such as rings, pins and awls. The presence of so many finds relating to metallurgical activity inside the houses and also in courtyards and streets indicate that the exposed buildings were inhabited by metal workers. The slags found in the Uruk settlement were analysed by Zwicker (1980:13-26). According to him a crystalline type of ore could not have been used for copper smelting because the resulting copper alloy would contain too much Sb and could not be fabricated into tools and weapons (1980:17). This type of ore could be found in tertiary volcanic rocks which have been mineralized locally. The copper car- bonates and the compounds of Sb, As, Pb and Zn occur as fissure fillings together with quartz and borite. Crystalline type of ore could have been used later as a raw material for an alloying reaction with copper to produce an alloy containing Sb and As and thus increase the hardness of copper (Zwicker 1980:17). Similar ores can be found in the Azerbaijan mineralized area which is the continuation of the northeast Anatolian mineralized zone. Although the high content of Sb and As would be suitable for an improved copper product in the diagrammatic tree of the development of metallurgy, there was no evidence of Sb and As in the slag analysis from the Late Chalcolithic level (Zwicker 1980:17). The ore used for the produc- tion of the excavated slag was an easily reduceable sandstone type of ore. In all slag samples investigated from Norquntepe, chloride was found in the interior of the slag so that one can assume that chloride fluxes were used for smelting this oxidized ore. It seems that at about 3500 B.C. in Norguntepe an oxidized copper ore was smelted and that first trials with a more complicated Sb and As containing ore were intended. At a later time, 2800 B.C. (end of EB I), the workshops of Norquntepe were among the early users of sulphide ore for smelting copper (Zwicker 1980:17). Zwicker believes that the small heaps of slag could indicate that the smelting was votive smelting for an unknown deity. This may or may not have been the case at Norquntepe, but what is beyond question is the fact that this settlement had the necessary resources to become an important metal workshop in</page><page sequence="9">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 67 the Uruk period. The Mesopotamian "colony" at Norguntepe seems to have shared the same fate as other similar settlements along the Euphrates which were abandoned in the Jemdet Nasr period. A short time elapsed before this site was re- settled at the end of the fourth millennium B.C. According to the pottery repertory of the EB Ia (levels XXVI-XXIV) one can postulate that the new settlers were of Anatolian and Syrian stock, in other words the local population of the Malatya- Elazig region. However, the strong Transcaucasian cultural traits in architecture (e.g. round-houses) and pottery became more apparent in level XXIV (Hauptmann 1982:22-3, f.n. 34). Shortly afterwards a new wave of newcomers arrived from the northeast bringing with them not only a new architectural tradition which was unknown in the Keban (wooden houses), but also their own metal industry (Hauptmann 1982:28). Finds relating to metallurgical activity in the first half of the third millennium B.C. include a horse-shoe-shaped fire place used for melting copper, smelting furnaces in levels XXI-XIX, clay-cones and a two-piece mould for casting a "Karaz type" shaft-hole axe (Hauptmann 1982: Pl. 26), crucibles and slag heaps. Metal artifacts from the EB I-II levels consist mainly of decorated pins (Hauptmann 1982: P1. 26). It should be added here that some of the pits (refuse?) found between levels XXII-XXIV and XXIV-XXV contained vast quantities of slag, fragments of moulds and crucibles. Norquntepe was not the only workshop producing metal artifacts in the Keban. The excavations at Tepecik and Tiilintepe demonstrated beyond any doubt that in these two settlements too metal industries flourished in the proto- urban period (Esin 1982:109, P1. 62, 2-3). Ten analyses of slag and copper-ore fragments indicate that malachite or azurite type ores were smelted at Tepecik and Tiilintepe (Ozbal 1983:214-15). The high Ni and As contents in some of the samples suggest that the copper used was not from the Ergani deposits. The smiths of Tepecik, Tiilintepe and Norquntepe could have obtained their supplies of copper from the deposits in Mazgirt, the Ovacik-Tunceli area, (4iplerk*y, Mamlis, Keydak and Karabek (Ozbal 1983:209). The copper-ore sample Bu-31/82 from Tepecik contained % 0-72 tin which could indicate not only another source of copper in Elazig, but a remote possibility that Pertek was a source of tin in antiquity (Ozbal 1983:209). The metal artifacts discovered in the Late Chalcolithic levels (Uruk settlement) and EB I-III houses are not very spectacular. However, of interest is a spearhead mould found in the EB II strata (Esin 1982: P1. 62,7). It is important to emphasize that high content arsenical copper objects in the Keban appear after this region was settled by newcomers arriving from Transcaucasia (or via Transcaucasia). Korucutepe Late Chalcolithic/EB I Tombs (van Loon 1978:10, 61-3; Winn 1981): Towards the end of the Late Chalcolithic Age the northeast corner of the mound had been used as a cemetery. During the time that the mound served as a burial monument for some nomadic groups, it was not resettled by the locals of the region. One of the two mud-brick tombs had a wooden roof recalling the roofed house-like tombs of the Kurgan culture (Winn 1981:114). The gray pottery found in one of the tombs is reminiscent of the ceramics of the Gray Ware culture of northern Iran, c. 3000 B.c. At Turengtepe this culture is considered to be Indo- European (Deshayes 1969:10-17). Finds from this cemetery include several lumps of copper ore near a child burial which suggests copper working nearby. But the most spectacular metal artifacts were discovered in two of the excavated monumental tombs. These are: (a) a mace-head of a bluish black metal, probably haematite or iron ore (van Loon 1978:60, P1. 110:2), (b) a silver band ending in spirals, (c) a tanged dagger with midrib, (d) a silver stamp seal-bracelet, engraved</page><page sequence="10">68 ANATOLIAN STUDIES with a horned animal, not unlike the wild mountain goat often depicted in Iran. This last item was worn by a female burial placed next to a richly adorned male burial. This double burial is reminiscent of the Indo-European practice of suttee, and the finds in the tomb indicate a stratified society (Winn 1981:114). Another burial, a young girl, was also buried with silver objects (van Loon 1978:60). Around her head a silver band (van Loon 1978: P1. 109:1) was accompanied with two pairs of small silver rings with overlapping ends. On top of her skull were two more silver rings, probably forming a head ornament. Around her neck she wore a crescent-shaped gorget made of silver (van Loon 1978: P1. 109:3). Near the right forearm 16 pieces of silver metal thread (4 mm. in thickness) were found. Near the pelvis a bent silver pin completes this extensive range of jewellery found in this tomb. Tombs similar in shape and in some of the contents as just described are known in Turengtepe and Tepe Gawra XIII-IX. At Tepe Gawra tombs of this class are described as unusual in character (Tobler 1950:66). They are divided into two groups; those intrusive into levels XIII-XIA and a further 53 intrusive into levels XI-IX. Many of the tombs contain rich collections of objects which are unparalleled in the occupational debris. This situation is very similar to that found at Korucutepe. Furthermore, regarding the identity of those buried in them, it is important to stress that level XIA at Tepe Gawra was fortified at the beginning of the Protoliterate period. Could it be that this first fortification wall was erected around the town to keep off the pastoralist tribes infiltrating across the Zagros and further north? In level XA the town's character is drastically changed; houses are small and shapeless. The population at this time was small, for only about half of the available area was utilized (Perkins 1949:174). It may well be that most of the "intrusive" tombs belong to this period. Arslantepe (Malatya) VIA-B (Palmieri 1981): The first of the two EB I horizons is characterized by its strong Syro-Mesopotamian connection. However, Palmieri believes that unlike sites such as Godin Tepe on the western border of central Iran, Nineveh on the Tigris, Habuba Kabira and Tell Kannas on the Euphrates, which were south Mesopotamian merchant outposts in the north, Arslantepe was "autonomous" having only mediate connections with southern Mesopotamia (Palmieri 1981:106). In my opinion this argument is highly deba- table particularly in view of the Uruk settlements at Norquntepe, Tepecik and Hassek H6yiik (Hauptmann 1976:56-8; Mellink 1982:563-4). One of the most spectacular discoveries made in level VIA, corresponding roughly to the proto- literate b-c/d period in Mesopotamia, is a hoard of "22 arsenical bronze objects made up of nine swords, three of them decorated with silver inlay, twelve spearheads and a plaque which is thought to be a buckle (Palmieri 1981:109, figs. 3-4). The dating of this hoard which was found in 2 bundles is problematical; it was found in the remains of a building which is slightly later than the (Protolit. c ?) palace (Palmieri 1981:104). Since this level VIA was destroyed during the Transcaucasian intrusion, is it not possible that the Arslantepe hoard was in fact buried there from a higher level, VIB or even later? At Hassek we have a similar situation, whereby a cist-grave sunk from the highest EB (I?) level into the (Late) Chalcolithic remains yielded two spearheads, two flat celts, a chisel, a dagger, a pin and a well-preserved macehead (Mellink 1982:563; Behm-Blancke 1981:103-8). The character and typology of the Arslantepe hoard have important chronological and technological implications in the evaluation of the origins of Anatolian and north Syrian metallurgies. According to Palmieri the swords must have been cast in open moulds and the spearheads in closed ones (Palmieri 1981:109). The swords are flat and there is no difference between the thickness of the blade and hilt. The</page><page sequence="11">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 69 hilts are decorated with raised bands, incised and some with silver inlay (Palmieri 1981: Fig. 3). The spearheads have leaf-shaped blades with a cylindroid mid-rib and a long butt. Tangs are straight, ending in chisel-shaped tips (Palmieri 1981: Fig. 4). This type of spearhead is closely comparable to those known to us from Karahasan (Watkins 1974:188-92) and Carchemish (Woolley 1952: P1. 61). If, in the light of the Arslantepe hoard, we have to re-date the Karahasan and Carchemish material, and the complexes to which they belong, then we ought to consider the Til Barsip and Hammam finds as belonging to the EB I and not to the EB III period as they are generally regarded. The plaque of quadruple spiral shape found together with the spearheads and swords (Palmieri 1981: Fig. 3) is equally problematic to date. In Near Eastern jewellery this motif is found in later periods (Maxwell-Hyslop 1971:34-6, 53), although in glyptic art it is represented in the EB I, not only at Arslantepe but in the Amuq (Phase G) and in the Euphrates valley as well (Palmieri 1981:110). However, what is chronologically disturbing to me is that plaques of absolutely identical shape, size and material'4 were found in the EB III graves at Ikiztepe (Onder 1981:189). Having pointed out briefly the complexity of the chronological problems regarding the Arslantepe hoard, I would tentatively subscribe to the view that some early metal forms survived in the local repertories of Anatolian, Transcaucasian and Syrian metal workshops longer than we usually suppose. The alloying technique, as described by Palmieri (1981:109), suggests that arsenic in high proportions was added to produce a deliberate alloy of arsenical bronze. The content of arsenic for the swords ranged betweeen 5-8 and 3-2%; for the spearheads 4-3-1-3% and finally for the plaque 5-6%. It is interesting to note that high arsenical bronzes were widely produced in the Pontus region and in Transcaucasia (Ozbal 1981:112; Kunq 1981:118-19). In fact the EB III cemetery produced hundreds of metal objects produced with this type of alloy. One of the quadruple spiral plaques from Ikiztepe was found to contain up to 5% As. This again raises the question of origin and date for the Arslantepe example. In Caucasia as well copper alloys with high arsenic contents are known from the early third millennium B.C. mounds and dolmens (Selimkhanov 1962:69). I agree with Palmieri that there were probably important links between the metallurgy of the Arslantepe hoard and that of Transcaucasia. D. THE AMUQ (Phases F and G) The phase F culture is generally regarded as contemporary with the Proto- literate a-b in Mesopotamia and northern Syria. It is possible to assume that the absence of metal objects preceding this period in the Amuq sites is the consequence of the limited excavations, both in scope and seasons, conducted in the prehistoric levels of major sites. The metal tools from phase F reflect the wide range of the local repertory which include reamers, pins, daggers and chisels (Braidwood &amp; Braidwood 1960:296-315). These were made of copper containing over 10% nickel. Although arsenic is present in these alloys this is attributed to the presence of nickel. From the typological point of view the metalwork of this period seems to have been the product of a local industry with a long tradition and experience. The phase G metal artifacts include cupreous objects such as pins, reamers and a necklace which, from the typological point of view, hardly shows an advance from the previous period. However, this phase witnessed changes in alloying techniques. Tin and arsenical bronzes are now more in evidence replacing the copper nickel alloys of Amuq F (Braidwood &amp; Braidwood 1960:296-315). There is no reason to believe that the new alloying techniques were developed by local</page><page sequence="12">70 ANATOLIAN STUDIES smiths with no outside stimulus. It is very likely that the changes in alloying practices were also related to changes in the sources of copper supplies. In fact, the high nickel content in the copper tools of the previous period suggest that the source for such copper may have been located as far away as Oman or western Iran. I5 The absence of nickel in phase G indicates a switch to different sources of copper ore. The cache of six anthropomorphic statuettes which was discovered in the debris just above floor 3 of Tell Judeideh (TT20 XIV), is assigned to the end of phase G/ED I.16 But if the cache was intrusive from a later level then it can be no later, according to Braidwood (1960:313), than the beginning of Amuq H/ED II. There is absolutely no comparable material from contemporary Anatolian sites, therefore special consideration should be given to these statuettes which were the end-products of a developed school of metalwork situated on the periphery of Anatolia and Mesopotamia. The group consists of three male and three female figures which were obviously cast using lost-wax process. The basic metal of the figurines is a copper-base alloy with over 10% tin content, to be called true bronze (Buchholz 1967: Tabelle 13). With the exception of one female figure all of the statuettes have various details added in a non-copper-base alloy. This metal is a silver-rich alloy with copper and gold. It was used in sheets for the helmets of the male figures and the caps and collars of the two larger female figures (Braidwood &amp; Braidwood 1960: 312-15). The clump in which the figurines were found yielded fragments of the accessories of the figurines in both the silver alloy and the cupreous metal with tin alloy. These miniature accessories suggest that weapons such as mace-heads, spearheads and helmets were probably manufactured in tin- bronze in the Early Dynastic I/II period in Syria. This is in sharp contrast with the rather late introduction of tin in the copper alloys of Mesopotamia. With the exception of a tin-bronze pin from Tepe Gawra VIII, which is the earliest occurrence of tin so far in Mesopotamia, the analytical evidence does not suggest the production of tin-bronze artifacts before the ED IIIA period (Moorey 1982:24-5; Muhly 1980:151). Conclusion On the basis of the material evidence presented, it is possible to arrive at certain conclusions regarding the early development stages of Anatolian metallurgy. Western Anatolia had enough sources of copper and silver to meet all the local '5The presence of Ni is higher in Anatolian copper ores than it is in most non- Anatolian ores. However, the Ni in Anatolian bronzes is not as high in proportion as found in Sumerian metalwork. Archaeometallurgical work from Oman suggests that the carbonate copper ores, easily smeltable in a single process, were the first used in ancient times (Weisgerber 1978: 15-28). Oman has a number of sites attesting to copper production in the third millennium B.C. The analyses of the slag samples did not yield any Ni in the copper ores in Oman (Weisgerber 1978: 28, n. 2). If the copper deposits in western Iran and in Oman are not rich in Ni, then other sources, including Anatolia, should be considered as the main suppliers of copper to the Sumerian cities. '6For a recent evaluation of the date of the statuettes see: Muhly 1980b: 148-61. According to Seeden however (1980: 8, n. 28), the account of the exact position and scanty context finds of the hoard as published is not convincing. According to him, there is evidence that the cache was actually retrieved from a tunnel dig at the very end of the excavation season, in which case the published context is fabricated. He prefers to date the hoard to the EB III (phases I and J). Since I am in no position to judge this claim by Seeden, I prefer to rely on Braidwood's original account of this find.</page><page sequence="13">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 71 demands in the proto-historical period. It would be wrong to assume that metal deposits could not have been exploited by the local smiths and therefore copper had to be imported from Cyprus. The west Anatolian products were certainly less sophisticated both in shape and technology when compared to the weapons, tools and jewellery found in eastern Anatolia and northwest Syria. The western smiths manufactured simple tools for certain home industries; such as textile, woodwork and leather goods. The metal finds from other minor sites, including Kumtepe Ib (Sperling 1976:356) and lasos (Branigan 1974:166) confirm the impression that west Anatolian metallurgy at this time was still of provincial character. Southeast European contribution in the shaping of the proto-urban cultures of western and central Anatolia is particularly felt in domestic architecture, religious imagery and pottery making." Therefore, I would doubt very much if the local schools of metalwork in this period were entirely of Anatolian heritage. They should rather be attributed to symbiotic groups formed by some local elements and the immigrants of Old European and proto-Indo-European affili- ations which interrupted the Chalcolithic sequence of western and central Anatolia.18 Regarding the eastern regions of Anatolia, one gets the impression that the metalsmiths who produced the metal weapons and small artifacts found at Hasek H6yiik,19 the silver jewellery of Korucutepe or the Amuq hoard were far more accomplished than their counterparts in other regions of Anatolia. It is correct to assume that both the northern and southern Mesopotamian sites had achieved a high level of expertise in metallurgy, especially making jewellery, by the Protoliterate c-d period (Moorey 1982:22-4). But their achievements in this field were hardly the result of local development alone. The fact that during the Proto- literate b period they formed merchant colonies along the upper Euphrates could be interpreted as their desire to tap the mineral resources and other commodities such as timber not readily available in Mesopotamia. It is therefore logical to postulate that these traders from the south soon became aware of other metalwork- ing practices which were beginning to emerge in eastern Anatolia and north Syria. The silver jewellery of the Korucutepe burials and those found at Tepe Gawra (XIIIA-VIII) recall the tradition of nomadic groups who carried precious metal ornaments on their body and attached (sewn) on garments, in other words personal wealth carried in ornamental form. If we tentatively agree that nomadic tribes and certain sedentary communities of different ethnic origins had their own metallurgi- cal traditions reflected in the repertory of metal objects found with their burials, then the metal artifacts of eastern Anatolia and the Tigris valley of upper Mesopotamia could be described as hybrid products: a blend of Near Eastern metallurgy, combining Mesopotamian inspiration with local peculiarities of form and technology. The workshops in the Keban region, and some of those in the Malatya plain, may be considered regional schools of metalwork in this period. As for the Amuq plain, there is no doubt that it was an important production centre 17The wattle-and-daub architecture of the EB sites in the Pontic region is reminiscent of the southeast European building tradition. This resemblance between the building traditions is a further indication that some Anatolian communities were socially, culturally and ethnically related to southeast European farmers. 180One of the most significant developments in Anatolian cultural history is the gradual disappearance of Chalcolithic cultures such as Hacilar I in the west and Can Hasan II in the south-central plateau and the appearance of new pottery cultures with northern affinities. This development is best observed at Can Hasan I-II, Fikirtepe, Kurugay, Demircih6yiik and Hacilar (Yakar 1981a: 95). "'For a summary of excavations at Hasek H6yiik see: Mellink 1982: 563.</page><page sequence="14">72 ANATOLIAN STUDIES during and following the Uruk period. In fact, even during the regression of the Mesopotamian cultural influence in northern Syria, it maintained a high degree of technological skill and artistic taste unparalleled elsewhere. If we exclude the evidence for the very early use of tin bronzes from Mersin on the grounds that it is stratigraphically doubtful, then both the Alishar and Amuq examples suggest its introduction in Anatolia not before the later phases of the Early Bronze Age I (c. 3000-2800 B.C.). Troy I evidence seems to agree with this dating. The question is, if Anatolia and Syria are not included in the geological belt of workable tin deposits (de Jesus 1978b:33-8), then where did the prehistoric smiths obtain their supplies from? The Mesopotamian merchants of the ED I-II period in the south were not the likely suppliers in view of the fact that tin was not widely used in Mesopotamia before the ED III period. One can postulate that this metal with its deoxidizing and hardening properties in alloys with copper, which in fact were characteristics known in arsenic-rich ores, was first introduced by itinerant metalsmiths. Tin which is heavy and bright is easily melted but not easily reduced from ore. The early smiths might have discovered rather quickly that if tin in metal form was added to copper only 1% of this metal would be absorbed in the process (Horne 1982:15). Since tin does not occur naturally in the metallic condition, but it is found in the combined state as a mineral (cassiterite), and rarely, in sulphide form combined with the sulphides of copper and iron (stannite,20 stannine or tin pyrites) in certain localities, it could not have been easily identified by prehistoric prospectors, particularly since the ore is heavy and usually dark brown or black in colour. In fact, except its weight, there is nothing to suggest that it is a metallic compound. But since it is usually found in alluvial sand, gravel or pebbles derived from the disintegration of granitic rocks bearing vein ore, it is not unlikely that this metal was discovered during the search for gold deposited by water.21 It may be worth noting that the first gold artifacts in Anatolia make their appearance almost simultaneously with tin-bronze objects.22 As for silver, it is important to emphasize that considering the extremely rich silver deposits (Ozbal and Yener 1983:73-84), local smiths in Anatolia would not have had any trouble extracting the ore, smelting it and going through the cupellation process as early as the late fourth millennium B.C.23 On the other hand some of the silver artifacts from Anatolia definitely share certain typological characteristics with their far more numerous counterparts from the "eneolithique" cemetery at Byblos and Tepe Gawra tombs (in levels XIII-IX). It is almost certain that the local workshops in Syria and Mesopotamia obtained most of their supplies 20A survey by George Rapp, James Muhly and Theodore A. Wertime in Turkey in 1972 reinforced the conclusion of geologists that no known cassiterite exists in Turkey. However, the occasional analytic traces of stannite in Turkish copper deposits, such as Arakll, convinced Wertime (1978: 4-5) that Turkey may have such deposits which pass unrecognized by its geologists. According to Wertime, it is inevitable that stannite will be discovered in sufficient quantities in northern and eastern Anatolia which will justify some of his theories regarding metal sources for the Ancient Near East. 211n the Sarkar valley southwest of Herat in Afghanistan, tin-bearing sands could give us an idea about mans first acquaintance with tin. The metal can be easily separated from sand by panning. Here and at Misgaran in the same region tin is found in association with copper (Cleuziou and Berthoud 1982: 16). 22A good example is the Amuq G hoard. 23For an assessment of silversmithing in EBA Anatolia see: de Jesus 1980: 63-81. His conclusions regarding the archaeology of silver artifacts (75-80) make some important points, but since they are presented against a chronological background which, in my opinion, does not conform with facts they should be treated with caution.</page><page sequence="15">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 73 of smelted silver from Anatolia (e.g. Cilician Taurus). The similarity in range between the Anatolian and Syrian/Mesopotamian objects could be explained as their being the products of metalworkers sharing the same artistic tradition due to their ethno/cultural affiliations (e.g. semi-nomads). The mace-head from Korucutepe of a bluish-black metal, most likely haematite, described by van Loon as probably iron or iron ore (van Loon 1978:60, P1. 110:2), raises the question of iron metallurgy in prehistoric times. How soon did the Anatolian metallurgists become aware of the presence of this metal in certain copper ores? This question could be answered in technological terms (Pigott 1982:20-5). As Pigott puts it "it was a relatively straightforward matter because not only do various ores of copper contain substantial amounts of iron but also the ores of copper and iron frequently co-occur in the same geological deposits. Furthermore, iron-oxide, in its various forms, was the primary fluxing ingredient in the process of copper smelting and bronze making. Consequently metallic iron was sometimes formed as part of the furnace by-products" (1982:21). Therefore, it is not impossible for the early metalsmiths of Anatolia to become familiar with this metal as a by-product before they began to smelt it for its own sake. II. The Early Urban Period EB II: c. 2800-2450/2400 B.c. This period in Anatolia represents an important phase in the development of settled communities and their socio-economic stratification. But the emergence of urban settlements in some regions did not bring fundamental social and cultural changes to every corner of Anatolia. The small farming communities maintained their traditional ways of life in rural settlements. During this period, however, the small agricultural settlements close to urban centres must have lost some of their economic independence to the latter as a result of demographic changes and economic concentration. During this period, which must have lasted four centuries, the metal industry in Anatolia continued to develop at a slow pace. Regional schools of metalwork in west and central Anatolia introduced new alloying methods for the production of bronze tools, weapons and other objects. However, unalloyed copper was still the most common metal used in Anatolia, followed by arsenical-bronzes, tin-bronzes of lower grades and alloys containing small amounts of tin and arsenic in copper (ternary alloys). Tin-lead pewters were occasionally produced by some local workshops in this period. For ornamental purposes pewter may have offered a more economical material than silver or tin-bronze. But it could also be that lead was included in the tin and arsenical bronzes in order to preserve the latter from "metal disease" (Selimkhanov 1978:56). In this period jewellery must have been far more plentiful than finds from excavations might suggest. This situation in Anatolia is comparable to that existing in southern Mesopotamia, where artifacts made of precious metals and jewellery are hardly found in the ED I-II periods. But if we consider the references to gold and silver in early Sumerian literature as an indication that skilled craftsmen were employed in the manufacture of precious cult objects for major Mesopotamian temples in this period, then one has to conclude that such objects were re-cycled and not discarded as easily as copper-based metals. This interpreta- tion may partly explain the scarcity of gold and silver jewellery in Anatolia in the urban period.</page><page sequence="16">74 ANATOLIAN STUDIES A. WESTERN ANATOLIA Our information for the metal industries is derived from a small number of stratified sites and extra-mural cemeteries. It must be stressed that the cemeteries of the so-called Yortan culture (Kaimil 1982) cannot be dated with much precision. Some archaeologists prefer to assign them to the EB II-IIIa period (Yakar 1979:60). Troy I-Ha-b: The rather poor preservation of Troy I architecture often raises doubts about the assumed existence of an elite community within its walls. Concerning the metallurgy of Troy I de Jesus even suggested that this settlement "was certainly in no position to launch out expeditions in search of minerals, establishing mining operations, develop a variety of metallurgical techniques and produce the artifacts found in" the excavations (1977). In my opinion there is little reason to doubt that the mercantile community of Troy I could control the natural resources in the Troad or maintain trade relations with settlements along the Aegean coast and in the eastern Aegean islands. Compared to most other local industries in southwestern and central Anatolia, the metallurgy of Troy I-IIa-b is relatively more sophisticated and varied.24 Could it be that Troy's accumulating wealth and its unique position in controlling the northwestern maritime trade attracted craftsmen not only from distant settlements, but also from among the nomadic tribes seeking profitable markets for their skills and products? Copper and bronze casting in open and closed moulds was practised at Troy I to produce jewellery and a range of other items (de Jesus 1980:135). Knives with curved blades and riveted handles are characteristic of this period (de Jesus 1980:135, n. 126). While pins were made of copper and silver, jewellery must have included gold artifacts and not only bronze-made examples. The local smiths of Troy I already possessed the technology to refine and amalgamate gold and also perfected a method for gilding (de Jesus 1980:135). Other technologies in the metal industry include the use of rivets for blades, copper and bronze sheet-metal working, cupellation of silver and probably tin-bronze production. Of the seven analyses from Troy I there is only one high tin-bronze indication, whereas the remaining results show that the unalloyed copper and low grade arsenical copper were the main metals used by the local smiths. Beycesultan XIX-XVI: The few analyses available from the EB II period suggest that at this site too the metalsmiths were using unalloyed and low arsenical copper to manufacture daggers and, probably, other basic implements as well (Esin 1969:128-30; de Jesus 1980:129-30). With the exception of a low grade tin-bronze found in level X (EB III), which could have been an import, there is no concrete evidence that tin-bronzes came into use at Beycesultan before the second millen- nium B.C. Kusura B: It is certainly not the best stratified Bronze Age site in western Anatolia. Therefore, the phase B evidence relevant to the study of regional bronze metallurgy in the EB II period should be treated tentatively. This may have lasted throughout the EB II and part of the EB III period. The small number of analyses available from phase B, a total of twelve samples, include at least one ternary alloy of tin, lead and copper (Esin 1969:18039), two tin-bronzes (Esin 1969:18094, 18047), a ternary alloy of tin, arsenic and copper (18043), and six arsenical coppers; the rest is unalloyed copper. The range of metal objects from this phase does not indicate any real change from the previous phase A which was limited to awls and points. Pins, however, became very common in this period. Tin-bronzes and 24See: de Jesus 1980; Branigan 1974; Esin 1969; Bittel 1959.</page><page sequence="17">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 75 ternary alloys attributed to this phase may have in fact belonged to the second half of the third millennium B.C. But it is equally possible that a regional school of metalworkers was producing artifacts made of medium grade tin-bronze and ternary alloys already in the EB II period. Other finds from Yazilkaya (Emirdag), now in the Afyon Museum (Esin 1969:144, 161, 180-5), may indeed suggest that such a regional school was located in the Afyon province. The workshops in this region could have been supplied with copper from near-by deposits such as Kizilca in Bakirli (MTA 1972:100), where traces of old mining activity exist, or from the Bayatkoy mines in Emirdag (MTA 1972:91). However, since these copper deposits are not known to occur with or near arsenic-rich ores, like those at Seydikdy and Seki in the Izmir province (MTA 1970:4-7), it is also possible that supplies of arsenic-enriched copper were brought from more distant areas in the west (Balya Maden) or from Derbent in Denizli (de Jesus 1980:91). The analyses published by Esin suggest that the metalsmiths of Yazihkaya (Emirdag), a site dated by Stronach (1957:90) to the Troy II period, used mainly low-grade arsenical copper for the manufacture of daggers and pins. Other alloys used to a lesser extent include lead-copper (Esin 1969:18109), and a low and medium grade tin-bronze (Esin 1969:18102-3). The latter include 1-1% lead which indicates the practice of deliberate ternary alloying known also at Kusura. Yortan (Balikesir): More than 100 pithos burials were excavated at this extra- mural cemetery (Kamil 1982). A number of dagger types of Troy II forms, and particularly, the unstratified Yortan axe (Przeworski 1967: pl. IV, 1; Stronach 1957:118, fig. 10:3), should convince us of placing the Yortan material culture, including its Troy I-II pottery horizon, into the EB II-IIIa (Yakar 1979:60; Kaimil 1982:60-7). The eight analyses published by Esin (1969:11795-802) are a strong indication that low and medium grade arsenical copper was the main alloy used to produce the metal artifacts. A spearhead of medium grade tin-bronze, and containing arsenic, is the only evidence that suggests the production of ternary alloys in Balikesir. Bayindirkoy (Ovabayindir): The metal finds from the EB cemetery (Bittel 1955:13-18) may be placed in the second half of the third millennium B.C. (Stronach 1957:99), in other words, at the end of the EB II and the first half of the EB III. None of the seven analyses shows any traces of tin in the copper. The daggers of Bayindirkoy were produced from low and medium grade arsenical copper (Esin 1969:3187-92) in accordance with the alloying traditions of western Anatolia. One of the daggers (Stronach 1957: 98, fig. 1:14) has a very unusual composition; for while it is quite free of tin, lead, antimony or nickel, it has a very high content of arsenic: 7-58%. The surface of this dagger (Stronach 1957: pl. Vb, 1), which is definitely of EB III date, is covered with lead plating presumably applied by soldering process (see also Eaton and McKerrel 1976:176). In fact, this dagger with its high arsenic content and plating could have been an import from the Bafra plain. At Ikiztepe too the EB III cemetery produced such weapons (e.g. spearheads). The only logical explanation for rendering such weapons useless without breaking them could be a tribal custom which probably required the sheathing of a dead warrior's weapon prior to its deposition in the grave. It is important to stress that at ikiztepe most of the EB III weapons were made from high arsenical copper. Karatay-Semayiik: Of the 420 excavated tombs in cemeteries of this EBA settlement, 74 of them contained metal goods in the form of personal jewellery, ornamental articles, tools and weapons (Bordaz 1982:262). A total of 266 metal objects found mainly in the burial jars (a few were found in the habitation areas)</page><page sequence="18">76 ANATOLIAN STUDIES has been studied by Bordaz after being separated into 22 classes and 32 sub-classes (1982:266). Most of the objects were made from copper-based metals. Since no analyses are available yet, there is no information about the alloying techniques used at this site. Bordaz is convinced that the Karata? copper-based artifacts are of a copper native to Cyprus. According to her, "the massive sources of this island, undoubtedly worked at this period, were exported to a market in the mainland, either as ores proper or in the form of specialized local items" (1982:297). The projected metallurgical analysis of the Karata? material may clarify this point, but in the meantime one should not ignore the possibility that the local deposits in southwestern Anatolia too bear evidence of former exploitation. The copper mines at Seki, Biilbiiller, Kizilca (MTA 1972:99-100), and Seydikdy (Ryan 1960:30) could have been exploited in the EBA to supply the local demands. After all, the evidence from Kozlu copper mines in north-central Anatolia suggests that the local prospectors were quite capable of mining for copper as early as the fourth millennium B.C. (Giles 1974). The metal artifacts from Karatag can be correlated with some of the EB II, but otherwise with the EB III material from stratified Anatolian sites. Therefore, an evaluation of the Karata? metallurgy within the EB II context could be misleading (see the EB III metallurgy). The fact that luxury items in gold and silver are not found in abundance should not lead us to conclude that the western regions, other than the Troad, lacked the necessary technology or artistic inspiration to produce such items. The burials from Karata?-Semayiik or those from Ahlath Tepecik (Mitten and Yiigriim 1974:26) contained silver trinkets which could have been manufactured locally (Mellink 1969: pl. 74, fig. 17-18; 1970: pl. 57, fig. 17). The EB settlements along the river valleys in Caria and Lycia may, no doubt, have exploited some of the argentiferous deposits near Bodrum; Giimii?lii, or those in the Aydin province; Giimiii (Yakar 1976:119; de Jesus 1980:276:169). Although the latter is not referred to in MTA 1972, the existence of old silver mines has been reported in some not so recent publications (de Jesus 1980:276; Forbes 1950:192). While admitting that the date of "old minings" are, in most cases, very difficult to establish, one cannot rule out the strong probability that some of the silver deposits in the southwest were being worked, along with the copper ones, in the late fourth or early third millennium B.C.25 Other deposits containing argentiferous galena in the western Taurus region include the Bozkir deposits in four different locations south of Lake Sugla. Here too old mining activity has been reported (MTA 2 5de Jesus has already stressed the difficulties in reconstructing the mining practices in Anatolia (1980: 98). Old mines sometimes are sealed by cavings, overgrown by vegetation or so worked out that they are no longer recognizable. And since mining and smelting at the same site was not commonly practised, the absence of slag deposits from a particular mine does not necessarily mean that it was not in use in prehistoric times. Referring to old workings, de Jesus criticizes some authors for considering mines "prehistoric", "Hittite" or "Classical" to suit their particular needs and thus making careless attributions. In his view (1980: 99) an old mine, like any archaeological site, should be dated by material found in the context, or former activity, either in the mine itself or in the context of the mining operations. But, since old mines accompanied by datable material are very difficult to find then we have to conclude, according to de Jesus' reasoning, that with the possible exclusion of Kozlu (de Jesus 1978: 98), all the other old workings are from the Ottoman times! Although I agree that there are limits to what we can presently infer from available evidence, I do not believe one should unconditionally subscribe to this logic. After all copper was widely used in Anatolia and it is unconceivable that the sources should have been limited to one or two mines in northern Anatolia.</page><page sequence="19">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 77 1972:109-10). The Agvak6y deposits which are composed of lead-zinc-copper- silver ores in the Kemer district may have been known to rural settlements in the Elmali plain (e.g. Karata?-Semayiik). Finally, the Aladag district with the Yelmezkdy (MTA 1972:110) and A?agi Esenler (MTA 1972:111) deposits contain- ing high silver content ore may have been known to ancient miners. From western Anatolian sites of this period so far only a few gold artifacts have been recovered. These are ear studs and beads from Bahkhane, Karata?- Semayjik, Pekmez (Aphrodisias) and some Yortan tombs. I agree with the assumption (de Jesus 1980:89) that "we cannot rightly conclude from this meagre showing that no gold-working industry existed in the Anatolian West". Unless primary gold deposits in western Anatolia were exploited as early as the EB II period, the secondary deposits (placer or alluvial gold) in Darphane, Akdllhqay and Sardis (MTA 1970: 20, 23, 26), could have been some of the sources known to the goldsmiths of the period. B. CENTRAL ANATOLIA The urban period in central Anatolia is not well documented either architec- turally or stratigraphically. The only exception to this is Alishar. Both Polath and Hash6yiik produced very little in the way of metal artifacts of this period to be considered under separate headings. Polath (Esin 1969:141) finds include four pins (11729, 11735, 11736, 11738), a chisel (11730) and a shaft-hole axe (11732) which have been assigned to this period. With the exception of a pin (11729) which is a low-grade tin-bronze and 11738 made of unalloyed copper, the rest are low-grade arsenical copper. The only analysis from Hash6ytik (Esin 1969:38, 17636) is that of a pin. It shows a low-grade arsenical copper alloy. Alishar T 14-13; M 8-11: The metalworkers of Alishar continued to some extent with the earlier tradition of manufacturing different objects of unalloyed copper. But, as the published analyses show, tin-bronzes of low and medium grades, and arsenical copper artifacts, put together exceeded the number of the unalloyed copper objects at this site (Esin 1969:124-7; de Jesus 1980:127-8). Most of the artifacts found at Alishar come from intra-mural tombs and consist of pins, including toggle pins of the late EB II period. Commenting on the metalwork of Alishar de Jesus remarks (1980:128) that this does not seem to have followed closely the spectacular development of other central Anatolian or Pontic sites such as Alacahdyiik, Kayapinar and to a certain degree, Ahlathbel. He concludes that the EB II metalwork from Alishar is distinctly inferior to that of its con- temporaries. This statement is, in my opinion, incorrect because it disregards the fact that: (a) Alishar EB II metalwork is earlier than that found in the Pontic tombs and settlements; (b) notwithstanding this chronological remark, it may be argued that to compare material from simple tombs with deposits in "royal tombs" may be misleading; (c) tomb deposits often reflect the religious beliefs of those buried. Therefore differences in the regional repertories of the metalwork, especially from burials of different cultures, does not necessarily prove the inferiority or for that matter the superiority of the metalworking practices of a particular region. The three different alloying techniques practised by the metalsmiths of Alishar point to co-existing traditions within the same regional school of metallurgy. It is interesting to note that while the artifacts discovered in the jar burials26 were of 26The custom of intra-mural burials below house floors and courtyards is deeply- rooted in Anatolia. But, even within this tradition, one can distinguish different burial forms, namely jar burials, cist-graves, and simple inhumations, most probably reflecting</page><page sequence="20">78 ANATOLIAN STUDIES simple forms such as pins and bracelets, the rather frequent use of tin-bronzes definitely suggests either a local source of supply or some sort of organized trade with distant regions, which in either case should have satisfied the increasing local demand for tin-bronzes. The copper deposits at Mentege near Kayseri (MTA 1972:91), and the Karaali deposits in the Ankara province (MTA 1972:84) which bear signs of "old workings", were the likely two sources available to the metalworkers of Alishar and other settlements within the Yozgat province. The fact that no moulds of EBA were found at this site has been interpreted by some (de Jesus 1980:128-9), as indicating that no independent metal industry existed at this urban settlement, and that the inhabitants obtained their metalwork from elsewhere. While this is not impossible, this interpretation is based on lack of evidence and therefore not entirely valid. It is hard to imagine a settlement this size, which was only partially excavated, not having developed a metal industry of its own in the proto-urban or at least in the early urban period. C. EASTERN ANATOLIA In the Karasu and Aras valleys the EB II settlements were rather small villages, inhabited since the late fourth millennium B.C. by farmers of Transcau- casian cultural heritage. It appears that most settlements in northeastern Anatolia were abandoned at the end of the EB II due to the arrival of new groups of pastoralists from the Caucasus and Transcaucasus region.27 Other events or reasons unknown to us could have also caused the abandonement of EB II settlements in most parts of the eastern Anatolian highlands, including the Van region. Before the advent of the Transcaucasian III period, most of the highland zone was culturally stagnant (Burney and Lang 1971:62-3). Another region unaffected by the advent of the EB III period was Van. Its vast pastures no doubt offered the intruding nomadic tribes ideal camping sites. The decline in the density of permanent settlements in this period could be related to the growing numbers of nomadic tribes which made the sedentary life more difficult. Karaz: The repertory of metal artifacts include daggers, shaft-hole axes, chisels, pins, awls, some jewellery and at least one sickle (Esin 1969:135). The range of these objects leaves the impression that the metal industry at Karaz was well advanced for this period. The analyses show that low arsenical copper alloys were widely used (75% of all objects analysed); the rest of the material was made of unalloyed copper (Esin: 17623, 17625, 17628). There is no indication that tin was used at Karaz, nor at other settlements such as Giizelova and Pulur in the province of Erzurum. Giizelova which is not far from Karaz produced only three metal artifacts; a tin-bronze bracelet (Esin 1969:17723) which is of questionable EB II date, a spearhead and a shaft-hole axe of low arsenical bronze which could be of EB II date (Esin 1969:17724-5). The use of low arsenical copper alloys in the Karasu and Aras valleys goes back to the late fourth millennium B.C. as is demonstrated by the Pulur finds (Esin 1969:17708-9, 11711-12). Among the copper deposits in the Erzurum area (de Jesus 1980:256-7; MTA 1972:17, 58-60), groups with different social and ethnic backgrounds. For instance at Alishar males were buried in all types of tombs, but only those buried in jars were accompanied by metal pins, which were usually found in the upper torso of the skeleton (Wheeler 1974: 420-1). Pins may have been accessories to a special kind of costume worn by a group of males within the Alishar community. 27Soon after a new culture emerges in the Pontus which is distinguished by its burial forms and highly skilled metallurgy.</page><page sequence="21">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 79 the ones at Pitkir may have been exploited as early as the proto-urban period. It is important to note that these deposits contain arsenical ore (realgar) as well (MTA 1972:60, de Jesus 1980: 202, 256). D. THE AMUQ (Phases H and part of I) Tell Judeidah is the main site for the study of Phase H in the Amuq plain. The 116 sq. m. exposure of the EB levels revealed elaborate domestic architecture (Braidwood &amp; Braidwood 1960). The mass intrusion of Transcaucasian elements in the Amuq and their co-existence with the local inhabitants does not appear to have had much of an impact on the development of the local metal industries. There is no indication that the possible outside stimulus, from sources other than Anatolia, included the EB II technologies of the farming communities in Transcau- casia. The 42 metal objects from this phase include pins, reamers, a large blade, a lancehead and an axe (Buchholz 1967: Tabelle 13). More than half of the analyses (13 out of 24) suggest the use of medium to high grade tin-bronzes. Some of these are ternary alloys of tin-arsenic-copper. The presence of a high silicon level in some of the bronzes is remarkable (Braidwood &amp; Braidwood 1960:373-9). The early part of Phase I, which is contemporary with the Cilician EB II (Yakar 1979:57), should also be included in the study of the urban period metallurgies in the Amuq, despite the fact that some of the nine metal objects from this phase (seven are copper-based metals with four made of tin-bronzes) could belong to the late Phase I: EB IIIa. The presence of a mould for metal tools found in Phase I (Braidwood &amp; Braidwood 1960:420-2) is a further indication of an independent metal industry at Judeidah. E. CILICIA This fertile plain which was densely populated in prehistoric times is an important source of information concerning the cultural contacts between Anatolia and Syria. In the EB II period this region resisted the early Transcau- casian incursion which affected the Amuq and a number of other sites along the Orontes and all the way south as far as the Jordan valley. Culturally, this region was linked to the southern plateau and became more Anatolian-oriented during the EB II. But, because of its geographical position south of the Taurus, it was exposed, more than any other region in central or western Anatolia, to various influences from rather distant cultures in Syria, Mesopotamia and even Cyprus. Tarsus, the key Bronze Age site in Cilicia, is our most reliable source of information for the study of the urban period and its related cultural aspects. Archaeological data from the EB II levels make it very clear that with the advent of the urban development in Tarsus, trade contacts with Syria/Mesopotamia and even with Egypt via Cyprus intensified, contributing to some extent to the promotion of central and western Anatolian trade with cultures across the Taurus barrier. Tarsus EB II: Compared to the EB I period metalwork which consisted mainly of small objects, in the EB II there is definitely a larger repertory of artifacts including toggle pins (Goldman 1956). De Jesus suggests (1980:134) that toggle pins make their appearance at Tarsus. It is possible that they were gradually introduced to other parts of Anatolia, to Cyprus and the Levant from Cilicia. But their chronological value should not be over-estimated in view of the fact that they are more widely known than was once thought and are found in the EB II contexts as well (de Jesus 1980:139). Toggle pins from Pulur IX (Kogay 1976: P1. 110, 1058) and KarataS (Mellink 1967:255, pl. 77, fig. 22) are contemporary with those found</page><page sequence="22">80 ANATOLIAN STUDIES at Tarsus EB II. The analyses from Tarsus EB II number some 28 of which more than half are unalloyed copper. This is in contrast to the situation in the neighbouring Amuq. The alloying of copper with arsenic or tin, and in some cases with both (ternary alloys) seem to have been practised by the local metalsmiths (Esin 1969:131-3; de Jesus 1980:134-5). The tin-bronzes are low to medium grade; the arsenical coppers too are low grade. Lead was occasionally added to the base metal either to lower the melting point or to prevent possible metal disease. Commenting on the ternary alloys at this site, de Jesus has suggested that "as opposed to most other sites in the EB II period the occurrence of both As and Sn in the same object may suggest a change in the smithing techniques" (1980:134). But, since the ternary alloying (with tin-arsenic-copper) was already practised in Anatolia (e.g. Alishar) and in the Amuq, it is hard to deteremine which of these two regions brought about the suggested change in the smithing techniques. Cilician settlements did not have to import copper supplies from very distant regions. Kizilca-Sarikavak deposits in Mersin (MTA 1972:113), where old works have been reported, could have met the local demands. The ore which contains some 7-7-4 gr./ton gold may have also been a minor source in the EB II period. Other sources of copper exist in the region of Anamur and Hatay (MTA 1972:113 and Map). Conclusion The rather rare occurrence of tin-bronzes in the western provinces and its absence in the east suggest that the exploitation and supply of this metal (or its ore) was in the hands of a few local or, more likely, itinerant metalsmiths. Being familiar with the characteristics of the ore they could have identified very small pockets of it during their search for minerals in Anatolia. It has been suggested, contrary to some other views, that Turkey, including the Troad, had never been a source of tin (Muhly 1977). Yet at the same time Muhly maintains that "this does not mean that there is no tin in Turkey". His contention is the following (1977): a source of tin may be depleted to the point where its exploitation is no longer feasible, but it can never be entirely exhausted. A tin stream, like a gold stream, may be worked out, but there will always remain minute traces of the alluvial metal. While not denying this, I still have my doubts whether it is always possible to locate the original lode source of the metal. According to de Jesus, who does not rule out Anatolian tin deposits (1978:37-8), the Bakir 0ay area provides tentative evidence of at least one tin deposit in the Amasya province (de Jesus 1980:55-6). Most recently however MTA geologists discovered tin-ore at Madenbelenitepe in the valley of Handere near Sogukpinar (township of Kele?) in Bursa (Kaptan 1983:170). The exciting fact about this discovery is the existence of some old cuttings and mining galleries along the slopes of Madenbelenitepe which indicate old workings (IaIatay, Altun and Arman 1980:40-9). Although these "old workings" cannot be dated at present, it will not be surprising if some of the earliest mining activity for the extraction of tin dates from the second half of the third millennium B.C. Whether the upper Sakarya and the region of U~ak possessed small tin deposits in antiquity (Yakar 1976:122; Ryan 1960:62; de Jesus 1980:55) still remains unanswered. A report submitted by an unnamed engineer to the government authorities of the Ottoman Empire in 30/8/1900 mentioned tin oxide (SnO2) deposits in the Giimele (Mihalgazi) region (Kaptan 1983:168). The ores, according to the report, contained between 0.25-0.35 and 1.75% tin. The same report also mentioned alluvial deposits in the region which contained 3% cas- siterite. The second survey in Giimele took place 40 years later and was conducted by E. Zimmer. His report, however, suggested that this area did not contain any</page><page sequence="23">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 81 tin deposits (Kaptan 1983:168). A year later, a third geologist (V. Stchepinsky) found small traces of tin (0- 1%) in Giimele (Kaptan 1983:69). But, whether the few Anatolian bronzes and those found in Cilicia and the Amuq were made of imported tin or locally exploited tin,28 there was certainly no great demand for this metal in the early urban period. The metallurgists were, as one can deduce by the frequency of the finds, quite accustomed to using arsenical copper for the production of a wide range of artifacts. Also, local supplies in almost every region were sufficient to meet the limited demand. Although tin-bronze did represent an improvement in material properties when compared with arsenical copper, it is maintained that "this improvement is not so marked as to be acceptable on its own as motivation for the general change" from arsenic-copper alloy to tin-bronze (Charles 1978:30). Furthermore, tin-bronze was not easier to make than copper- arsenic alloy, except in the greater variability of the latter material as regards the alloy content and in the volatization of arsenious oxide from a metal surface under oxidizing conditions as when handling a crucible and casting into a mould. Although the early urban period in Anatolia brought about certain socio- economic and cultural transformations, in the field of metallurgy the advances, both in technologies and variety of objects, were not spectacular. In fact, as far as central or eastern Anatolia is concerned, it is possible to detect a period of stagnation which lasted until EB III. In western Anatolia on the other hand a number of regional schools of metalwork were emerging in the Troad, Afyon, Balikesir, Denizli and maybe in the Elmall plain as well. These schools (industries) specialized mainly in the manufacture of daggers with short tangs and flat axes made of copper-arsenic alloy.29 The artifacts from Plnarbail G61 near Afyon (Moorey 1974: 114), seem to confirm that among all these schools, the Afyon workshops were the most active. Another aspect distinguishing the western metal industries from the rest of Anatolia is the fact that silver and gold jewellery were produced by the former in far greater numbers. However, if we give a general assessment of the EB II metallurgy in Anatolia, then we have to conclude that the Amuq region, and to a certain degree Cilicia, were the leading centres followed closely by those in western Anatolia. Unlike the EB II period in Anatolia, the corresponding late ED I-early ED III metallurgy in Mesopotamia is much better documented. In addition to a few archaic texts where we have various references to metals, metal products found in tombs provide us with enough material evidence to study the development of the metal industries in the first half of the third millenium B.C. As was the case with Anatolian metallurgy, tin started to appear with the advent of the ED III. As Moorey has pointed out (1982:25), supplies of tin, from sources still unknown, were not regular. But this cannot be said regarding other metals and in particular copper and copper-arsenic alloys. 28The existence of wolframite and tantalite adjacent to the gold quartzes at Malayer in Iran is considered as a possible clue to tin not unlike that in Egypt. Also the small cassiterite deposits in the granites about the Persian Gulf running from Iran toward India could have been exploited in antiquity. See Wertime 1978: 6. For tin occurrences in eastern Iran and western Afghanistan read Cleuziou and Berthoud 1982: 14-19. 29As for tin-bronzes, Troy I, with only one example, could not have been the initiator of this metal in the urban period. In fact Thermi with four examples of tin-bronze artifacts has a better claim to be considered a leading tin-bronze production centre in the eastern Aegean and western Anatolia. See: Branigan 1974: 147. So far there is no archaeological justification to conclude that Troy I controlled the flow of tin to the Aegean at this time. Other sources, or the role of the itinerant smiths, should not be minimized in this context. See also Branigan 1974: 64; Dayton 1971: 49-79.</page><page sequence="24">82 ANATOLIAN STUDIES In the ED I-II the range of metal products in the south and also in the Diyala valley included simple sheet copper vessels, lead vessels, copper mirrors, cast vessel- stands, copper pins, flat axes and daggers.30 With the start of the ED III (the late EB II in Anatolia and phase I in the Amuq) the repertory of metal artifacts found in tombs becomes more varied and includes tools and weapons made mainly of copper or arsenical bronze and a few tin-bronzes. This situation is reminiscent of the tomb deposits in western Anatolia (e.g. Yortan) where most of the finds (daggers, spearheads and axes) are dated to the late EB II or early EB III. Metal temple furnishings in Mesopotamia appear in the ED I-II. Vessel stands with solid cast anthropomorphic copper statuettes made by the lost-wax method further stress the technological skills and artistic achievements of the Mesopotamian smiths which were unparalleled in Anatolia in the corresponding period.31 Already in the first half of the third millennium B.C. the Sumerian metalsmiths working in major urban centres were masters of basic casting techniques in the manufacture of statuary; solid casting for small statuettes and hollow casting for large ones. They were also long familiar with different soldering techniques and jewellery making. Compared to these, the products of the regional and local schools of metalwork in Anatolia have a rather provincial character. The conclusion derived from this comparison is the following: The industrial structure under which craft techniques in metal developed and artistic skills flourished required a socio-political system where class differentiation led to the creation of aristocracies, or other forms of elite ruling class, in both urbanized societies and semi-nomadic tribes. It is only in such socio-economic environments, which were not fully developed yet in Anatolia, that skilled workers could find the necessary incentives and artistic inspirations. The next question we have to ask ourselves is to what extent did Anatolian metallurgy influence the Aegean in the first half of the third millennium B.C.? Branigan in discussing the origins of the Aegean metallurgy (1974:97-102) remarked that the Sitagroi III finds suggest a likely source of inspiration for the first Aegean metallurgy. The material culture, and particularly the pottery, of this site are closely related to the metallurgically quite advanced Chalcolithic cultures of southeast Europe (e.g. the Gumelnita-Kodjadermen complexes in Bulgaria and Rumania). Here, unalloyed copper was used to produce a large variety of artifacts which include most forms found later in the Aegean "Late Neolithic". I agree with Branigan that "metallurgically, geographically, and typologically the Bulgarian-Rumanian Copper Age, with its Macedonian offshoot, seems the obvious source from which to derive Aegean metallurgy, particularly as it is chronologically compatible too" (Branigan 1974:98). Since Anatolia too partly owed its proto-urban metallurgy, at least initially, to southeast European expertise, it could not have influenced the emergence of the local Aegean metal industries in any significant way, certainly not before the EB III period. Therefore some distant similarities between the metal products of Aegean and west Anatolian sites could be explained as resulting from similar stages of development during the EB I. The comparison of metalwork from Troy and Thermi (Branigan 1974:128) has often caused archaeologists to believe that Troy and the Troad were major sources of inspiration for the Aegean centres. It must be stressed that the Thermi material is of late EB I-EB II date, in other words contemporary with Troy I-IIb, and not 30For a comprehensive presentation of metallurgy in Mesopotamia in the late fourth and third millennia read Moorey 1982: 25-34. 31Ibid. 27.</page><page sequence="25">REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS OF METALWORK 83 with Troy IIc-IV/V. Interestingly enough, this chronological equation makes Thermi one of the earliest schools of metalwork where tin-bronzes were produced locally (compared to one tin-bronze object from Troy I, Thermi produced three artifacts and a possible tin bangle) (Branigan 1974:129, 147). The relative independence of Thermi's metal industries from Anatolia at this time can also be observed in some of the alloying techniques; copper lead alloys at Thermi account for 14% of the total, while at Troy, for instance, it was not known (Branigan 1974:129).
