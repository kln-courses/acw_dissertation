<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOCAL CHURCH RECORDS AS SOURCE MATERIAL By J. Olson Anders, Ph. D. Historical Records Survey. 134 ARKANSAS HISTORICAL QUARTERLY "History, in the broadest sense of the word, is all that we know about everything that man has ever done, or thought, or hoped, or felt."1 Historiography is neces- sarily a sampling process. The historian's task is to pre- sent every phase of life in its proper proportions. Human faculties have not hitherto been able to meet the require- ment. The religious field, in particular, has been neglected. To trace the organization and growth of churches and to portray statistically the numerical and financial strength of denominational bodies is relatively easy. Nor is it difficult to obtain data on the confessions adopted, the creeds main- tained. But objective presentation has been handicapped by the insistence of each group that its interpretation be ac- cepted. For this reason church history has remained to a large degree the province of the denominational historian. The lag in the field has, however, in its last analysis, a deeper reason. The size of the population, the material equipment, and the institutional structure are not sufficient to explain the status of a people as a nation. More important are the ethical, humanitarian, and religious ideals, the will- ingness to sacrifice, the will to live, all the intangible ele- ments that determine the morale of the people. Unfortunate- ly social science has not yet devised adequate means for measuring these intangibles. The fantastic and the extraordinary diverts the human mind. Spectacular events and impressive individuals possess fascinating allurement. Front, poise, and personality seem 1 James Harvey Robinson, Medieval and Modern Times, p. 1.</page><page sequence="2">LOCAL CHURCH RECORDS AS SOURCE MATERIAL I35 all-important. Attention is centered on the leader, the aristocrat, the elite. Gradually a more mature social science has accorded the common man greater recognition. Recent events have aroused still greater apprehensions regarding the validity of old assumptions. Unexpected mass move- ments bring to the front new ideas and new leaders that do not conform to respectable patterns. Possibly the inarticu- late masses play a role in the social world similar to that of the subconscious in the individual. Political scientists- have produced learned treaties on county government, hardly aware of the wealth of direct experience recorded in the near-by courthouse. Agricultural history has been written while the county agricultural census reports have continued to serve as footstools in crowded county offices. The haphazard custody bears witness that the community has little appreciation of the value of the local church records. To determine the role of the inarticu- late masses in our society the social scientists must utilize the sources which will bring them into the closest contact with the subject. The greatest contribution of the Historical Records Survey2 is to direct attention to the abundance of the local records and to reemphasize their importance. The theme of this paper is the local church records. There are today in Arkansas about 7,000 churches belonging to about 80 dif- ferent denominational bodies. The wealth of local source material that these churches possess presents a challenge and an opportunity. Broad generalizations have been propounded to ex- plain the social sources of our prolific denominationalism. The socially and economically disinherited meet a reluctant welcome in our respectable churches. Emotionally starved, they seek vicarious compensation in f ormulks which exalt their religious virtues. Economic and social factors are undeniably important in our ecclesiastical schisms. But the 2 A nation-wide WPA project which is preparing bibliographic guides to the county, church, and other local records.</page><page sequence="3">I36 ARKANSAS HISTORICAL QUARTERLY explanation may not lie entirely in crass terms of forms of production. Possibly the sounder approach is rather, in spite of seeming paradoxes, that traits, forms, and attitudes that promote human survival tend to survive. It is certain at least that any broad generalization needs sub- stantiation through concrete historical and sociological studies of actual situations. We can ill afford anything less than the full utilization of our human resources. The Negroes constitute approxi- mately 25 percent of the population in Arkansas. The clearest line of demarcation in the state's complex ec- clesiastical structure is racial. The Negroes attend their own churches and these often belong to separate denomin- ational bodies or to separate ecclesiastical subdivisions.3 Utilitarian considerations demand careful social analyses, not least of the colored contingent of our population. Before the Civil War the slave commonly attended the church of his master. Today the worship is separate. Why was the change made and why at the time that it was made? Did the Negro gain by being put on his own feet, or did he lose by being deprived of experienced advice? Was the change in accord with the ideals of a democratic nation? Do the colored churches meet the demands of a modern society? Our knowledge of even the external and more obvious aspects of the colored religious organizations is limited. Detailed research is necessary before we can hope to answer broader questions. The colored Methodists in Arkansas belong to four different bodies. How does the social attitude of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church or the African Meth- odist Episcopal Zion Church differ from that of the African Methodist Episcopal? How does the inclusion of a colored contingent in the Methodist Church affect aThe colored Baptist and most of the colored Methodist churches are segregated in separate national organizations. In the Seventh-day Adventist and Presbyterian churches the colored congregations belongs to separate ecclesiastical subdivisions. The Churches of Christ, which disclaim the need for general organ- ization, and the historic Roman Catholic and Protestant Episcopal Churches have separate colored congregations but do not carry the segregation further.</page><page sequence="4">LOCAL CHURCH RECORDS AS SOURCE MATERIAL I37 the social development of the state? The colored Baptists organized their first church in Arkansas in 1845.4 In this they had the sympathetic sup- port of the whites. Why was this step taken at that particular time? The organization of a colored Baptist state convention in 18675 was a momentous event. Is the quarrel in the national convention over the management, of the publishing house an adequate explanation of the unfortunate schism in the state convention in 191 5. 6 Are personal factors a sufficient explanation of why the attempt to consolidate the two rival state conventions in 193 1 resulted in the existence of three state conventions?7 . Other colored religious bodies require similar studies. For instance, the Church of Christ (Holiness) was organ- ized in 1894.8 A schism in 1907 gave rise to the Church of God in Christ,9 and a schism in the latter in 193210 resulted in the organization of the Church of God in Christ Congregational. Each of these bodies claims to be the original church. But to continue to enumerate similar op- portunities for study will seem like tiresome repetition. The Churches of the Living God do, however, raise interesting questions. The Church of the Living God, Christian Workers for Fellowship, was organized in 1889. In 1925 a number of churches withdrew and organized the Church of the Living God, "The Pillar and Ground of Truth/'11 The Churches of the Living God cite scriptural evidence that the Hebrew patriarchs and prophets and Jesus himself were black.12 This belief carries implications 4 [Julia E.

Church historians have given the white churches far better attention. Unfortunately denominational considera- tions have often precluded scientific objectivity. Because of its greater familiarity to the student it may be sufficient merely to indicate at this point that the possibilities of the subject have by no means been exhausted. The local dhurch records offer rich sources for topical research, both historical and sociological, especially well adapted for university dissertations. The church and board minutes reveal the historical background without which the present significance of the church is incom- prehensible. To this the picture of the material growth as portrayed in the financial reports will be an excellent complement. The sociologist will find in the church register a mine of information regarding the church population with- out which any social analysis will be inadequate. The records of the auxiliary organizations will tell him how the church is meeting important social obligations. Such studies will lead directly to problems of social planning. Six churches in a town of 500 strain the economic resources so that all die of malnutrition. In many countries this problem is met by the establishment of a state church. How can we insure the small community the benefit of religious services and retain our free church system ? Denominational, synodical, diocesan, convention, and associational records, hitherto fruitful sources of historical and sociological studies, reflect the attitude of the church leaders. The time is now ripe to establish direct contact with the less articulate common man through the local church records. A county history, "in the broadest sense of the word/' is no mean task. Sociological surveys of our com- munities are of vital importance. These local studies will serve as sound bases for broader surveys, state-wide, regional, and national.

Arkansas lies in the "Bible Belt". The term is tenuous and defies geographical delimitation. Its heart is Ozark- Appalachia, but its outposts are fare- flung. The Pentecostal movement, the fastest growing denominational group in the land, presents the more spectacular phase of the "Bible Belt". The talk in unknown tongues and the pronounced physical manifestations of the baptism of the Holy Ghost are of peculiar interest to the social psychologist. But the more conservative American Baptist Association13 is a more representative exponent of the fundamentalist creed of the "Bible Belt". The American Baptist Association places modernism, evolution, and Romanism on its index ex pur gat or ins. The creed may probably be stated best by quoting the associa- tional minutes :14 Modernism designates "an element of people who have substituted a false theory of science and philosophy of Biology, Psychology, Geology and Theology. For the Truth Finally, the doctrine of Modernism is in- cluded in the word 'Evolution', and the advocates of this theory of Evolution have disputed and rejected the Genesis account of creation, and even the virgin birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .... "15 "Evolution .... means that through some un-explained method man has evolved from the lower order of animal life, such as apes and monkeys; i.i Darwin, Haeckel, Morris, and others would have you be- lieve. This is in direct opposition to the Genesis account of man's creation which says that God created man in his image."16 "Modernism or evolution would destroy our 18The American Baptist Association has its national headquarters in Texarkana, Arkansas- Texas, and approximately two-thirds of its churches and membership are in those two states.

The power of Romanism is fostered by the powers of hell. Jesus said the gates of hell could not prevail against his church. But Baptist folks are the only ones that can successfully fight Romanism for all others are Rome related."20 The "Bible Belt" has a limited literary expression, especially so the Pentecostal wing, the wing distinctly re- presentative of the lowly in our society. The associational minutes quoted above reflect the principles formulated by the leaders. The local church records lay bare the deep roots. What social forces find expression in the movement? Of what significance is it to our budding democratic ideals ? How will it affect our future civilization? Such questions make it a fascinating field for the historian, the psychologist, and the sociologist. The "Bible Belt" is indeed an excellent illustration of the opportunities for research in the religious field. Incidentally, concentration of attention on the local church records will stimulate an appreciation of their value. Hitherto these records have at times been indifferently kept and often scattered haphazardly throughout the community. Appreciation of their value will arouse a local pride, which will find expression in better record-keeping and adequate provision for their custody and ready accessibility. These measures will be accompanied by the interested support essential to the social research of which we stand in urgent need. x7Minutes of the Fifty-fourth Annual Session of the Union Baptist Association, 1925, pp. 8-9.
