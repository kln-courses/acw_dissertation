<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ancient View of Greek Art: Criticism, History and Termi- nology. By J. J. Pollitt. xiv + 464 PP. (Yale University Press, New Haven and London), ?I2.50. The author begins by putting to us the aim of this book in the form of a question, a straightforward enough but bedevilled one: What did the ancient Greeks think about their art? To get anything like an adequate answer really means being pro- vided with a coherent view of art criticism in antiquity; and that in turn requires knowledge of the origin, development - and if possible - the meaning of the critical vocabulary employed by those Greeks who showed any interest in art. Not easy requirements these; and anyone who claims even partly to fulfil them must arouse our curiosity. The strategy of J. J. Pollitt's contribu- tion to the question is apparently straight- forward too. His book falls into two quite distinct parts. The shorter first section serves as an introductory, perhaps some- what essayistic general historical review of art criticism in antiquity, but the relevant facts are presented clearly and as sensibly as one is likely to find. In these ioo or so pages (supplied with useful notes) the author considers some of the more im- portant facets of the sources, traditions and types of criticism. Conceptual terms with larger implications, such as technd (art) and mimisis (imitation), are treated separately here. The other much longer section and practically a book in its own right is altogether more specialist in 614</page><page sequence="2">THE LITERATURE OF ART substance. This part is an extensive glos- sary. The principal terms of Greek criticism, as in a dictionary, appear in alphabetical order; and arranged chrono- logically under each term are the textual examples from the ancient authors which give testimony of their use. Meaning is in each case examined briefly and at times speculatively in the author's commentary which follows the series of testimonia. Se- lection of most of the terms was made on the basis that they reveal in context some degree of critical, i.e., evaluative be- haviour. There would seem at a casual glance to be really two glossaries since the Greek is followed by a separate alpha- betical Latin list of terms. But a compel- ling historical reason explaining why the Latin is there is told in the introductory first section. The concession made to the non-classicist reader -, and Professor Pollitt assures us he has him in mind - is that of the English translation appended to each explicatory Greek and Latin passage. Indeed, it might be thought, the sections of the book want to strike an uncontentious balance between specialist and non-specialist concerns; and yet there is a deeper problem here, and one which although unresolved does not I think bring any final discredit on the book. No surprise should remain that genuine criticism did exist in antiquity, though it is amazing how often still one finds in- formed individuals even in the humanities expressing wonder about the fact. Maybe this lingering confusion has something to do less with the available information than with its presentation. The basic facts are these. Firstly, and most annoyingly, no ancient treatises dealing directly and exclusively with art survive: except that doxographical traditions and literary allu- sions give indications of their one-time existence. Secondly, and this is the diffi- culty, the scholarly consideration of such hints, even when seconded by archae- ology, is forced to work with an embarras- singly long time-span. That is, very often the literary passages which apparently refer back to the Greek origins of criti- cism are in fact remote from the event by as much as six, seven or eight centuries. The prospect is dizzying; the dangers of error immense. No wonder the tenacious legend has taken root that classical art in relation to its expanded after-life reflects a majestic, ideally serene stillness. We see the Greek view of art at second-hand through the Latin reproduction of it, and much depends on the scholarly ability to re-adjust that telescope to its original focus. But particularly over the last I oo years something quite marvellous has happened. Bit by bit, and mostly thanks to the great names of German philology, a 'text' of a kind was re-assembled which began to look something like the lost originals. Without this work, of course, as Professor Pollitt acknowledges, his glos- sary would be impossible. The break- through came, in the nineteenth century, with the major realization that the Elder Pliny's chapters on art in his encyclo- paedic Historia Naturalis (first century A.D.) were really compiled and indeed copied from much older critics, bio- graphers and historians of art. Here began the restorative work, as Silvio Ferri calls it, of a graeca restitutio, a re-translation from the Latin to the Greek again of the chief terms of critical judgement which the Romans had tried to match. This alone is a remarkable detective story; but what emerges from it is even more interesting. It turns out, for in- stance, that the first Greek critics were the artists themselves. This fact has not received enough theoretical emphasis, not least if we consider what a radical depar- ture this new attitude of professionalism is from the anonymity which preceded it in other Mediterranean civilizations. There is another good reason why the question of emphasis has important theoretical con- sequences. Professor Pollitt suggests that there are at least four different traditions of art criticism in antiquity: in his words, the professional, philosophic, literary, and popular or 'magical' levels. The first three became articulate at different dates and can therefore be arranged in some general historical sequence. Now, the specified tradition called 'literary', springing from rhetorical preoccupations with the styl- istic analogies between the visual and literary arts, is identified as belonging chiefly to the Hellenistic period. But it might well be the case that the technical concerns of the earlier (professional) artist-critics have to be matched coevally with the appearance of the technical treatises on rhetoric. The critical expres- sions of professionalism for these artists, e.g., Polyclitus c.450 B.C., imply not only literary influences but actual involvement in philosophic currents, Sophistic and otherwise. What this possibility suggests is that the levels were from the start interlocked, and that the question of their articulation at different times is more the effect of the extant texts and our inevitable reliance on them. The problem then is at bottom one of theory, or better, of assumptions. The nuance of the difficulty shifts. What the Greeks thought about their art is finally not as crucial a question as what we are to make of what they did apparently think. The first question assumes that if only we comply with the hard enough philological task of finding evidence, an answer of some sort must be forthcoming. But facts do not automatically acquire their pragmatic aureole; not, that is, without the prior summons of a theory which coaxes what we do not see out of what we see only too well. Why in fact did the Greeks have art criticism at all? Did its appearance have anything to do with their type of society? Did it have any- thing to do with the appearance of anthropomorphic innovations in art? And if originality in art and criticism are coeval, what does this really mean? Questions like these are rarely put so directly. Classical specialists are notori- ously shy of theory: a wariness justifiable because of their struggle with recalcitrant materials. So, by natural inclination, they would look closely at the glossary first, and attend less to the introductory section. Indeed, for the classicist, that historical review is only an extension of the scholarly apparatus - 'remarks', so to speak - and it would take some intrepidity to suggest that the reverse is probably true. Viewed this way we have the unresolved halves of two, not one book: the glossary of the restorative scholarly text of ancient criti- cism confronting the assumptions about the history of that phenomenon. This as I said does not discredit the book. It remains if for that very reason a useful one, well produced, and of impor- tance not only as a reference book for students of classical art but generally for those inquiring into the origins of Western art and aesthetics. The book is also being issued in an abridged edition, with a shorter selected glossary, and is aimed specifically at non- specialist readers. RICHARD APPIGNANESI</page></plain_text>
