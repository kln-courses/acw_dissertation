<plain_text><page sequence="1">Natural Law Revisited: Wild Justice and Human Obligations for Other Animals Celia Deane-Drummond This essay lays out preliminary grounds for an alternative theological approach to animal ethics based on closer consideration of natural law theory and etho logical reports of wild justice compared with dominant animal rights perspec tives. It draws on Jean Porter's interpretation of scholastic natural law theory and on scientific narratives about the laws of nature to navigate the difficult territory between nature and reason in natural law. In Western societies, at tempts to detach from our animal roots have fostered forms of legal provisions that treat animals as property rather than as living, social beings entangled with human societies. Introduction This essay considers the significance of reports of wild justice and political alli ances in social species for an interpretation of natural law and legal obligations to animals. Animal rights offer the dominant philosophical alternative to the legal position of animals as human property.1 Peter Singer's animal liberation approach differs insofar as it uses a utilitarian calculus based on creaturely in terests and the capacity for sentience, but Catholics in particular are inclined to react either negatively because of Singer's accusation of speciesism, or more positively through attempts at accommodation.2 A theoretical discussion of animal rights, plagiarizing as it does from equally theoretical modern notions of human/natural rights, is not a convincing starting point for delivering a framework for protection of other animals and their ethical treatment, however shrill its original advocates.3 If animals are given "rights," then their moral worlds are automatically circumscribed within that of human moral advocacy. Particular humans may act as proxies for animals, rather as an adult might act Celia Deane-Drummond, PhD, is director of the Center for Theology, Science and Human Flourishing and professor of theology in the Department of Theology at the University of Notre Dame, 130 Malloy Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556; Celia.Deane Drummond. 1@nd.edu.

Rights understood as a particular demand arising from an individual subject does not make sense in the case of animals except by a kind of co-option by human advocates. Further, it seems likely that modern stress on autonomy and avoidance of suffering, which Charles Taylor characterizes as a particular feature of modern Western civilizations, becomes transposed onto animal worlds.4 Animals thus enter our world according to our particular cultural sensitivities and are treated accordingly.5 The door is still left open for a comparative human exceptionalism with little room for maneuver. So far there have been few attempts to search for alternatives, other than outright rejection, either from a philosophical or theological standpoint. This essay lays out the preliminary ground for an alternative by probing aspects of natural law and wild justice that so far have not received sufficient attention. One of the first issues to address in charting what that possible alternative might look like is that the relationship between "nature" and "reason" in natu ral law is an edgy one. The argument of this essay builds in the following way. First: What are the ways in which natural law might be understood to reflect both internal capacities and external constraints? Both aspects also raise issues about the way natural law might cohere with or challenge secular accounts of evolutionary ethics. More explicitly, how is natural law in the moral sphere related to laws of nature in the scientific sphere, and is a scholastic account of natural law still defensible in the light of modern science? The third section of this essay tackles the more specific issue of justice and subjective and objec tive "natural rights." However, rather than extend natural (or human) rights to other animals by proxy, as in animal rights, I argue instead for an etiological starting point in critical engagement with wild justice. Instances of capabilities in animals cohere to some extent with scholastic natural law perspectives. But the latter fail to appreciate the level of sophistication in the complex social worlds of animals. Laws, operative in all social species, including humans, can be interpreted as controlling functions of highly complex self-organizing social systems. All these factors point to a rather different approach when one con siders human obligations to other animals. What Is the "Natural" in Natural Law? One might think that if natural law is a capacity, then it could be lined up with standard neo-Darwinian versions of evolutionary ethics where moral capability is understood as a sophisticated cognitive skill learned in order for individuals to act successfully in complex social groups. According to this scenario, human moral reasoning develops within restraints set by particular cognitive functions. Something like this is implied in the scholastic understanding of the soul where the rational soul is inclusive of vegetative and animal souls.6 It makes sense,</page><page sequence="3">Celia Deane-Drummond • 161 then, for Aquinas to view natural law in a primary sense as that which reflects the flourishing of life, the sentient life of animals, and, finally, the rational life of humans.7 Even if it is difficult to make a convincing case that such gradation in natural law mirrors in any accurate sense current evolutionary understand ing, it is consistent with it at least at a superficial level. There is, however, an important difference worth noting. Moral capacities are emergent in evolution ary terms. There are reasons why such capacities appeared or, in other words, why it proved to be a selective advantage. For Aquinas, divine law provides the teleological orientation for natural law in a manner that would be alien for evolutionary ethics. According to an evolutionary perspective, moral judgments are part of a wider emergence of complex forms of cooperative behavior. Many species, including social insects, such as bees, ants, and so on, with far less intelligence than humans are clearly capable of intense cooperation. Rather, the point is that in complex societies there is an option to opt out, so regulating behavior is required for social flourishing. However, if natural laws are not so much an individual moral compass but objective moral rules for human societies, then these rules are embedded in so cial structures. Restraints appear independent of individuals who, by their moral agency, have particular capacities to conform to or reject such rules. Accord ingly, societal rules protect individuals from those who might otherwise refuse to cooperate. Standard evolutionary psychology narratives presuppose that all external regulatory devices emerge in order to restrain individual selfish behav ior. Religion, rather than having its own ontology of revelation, is perhaps the crowning thesis of sociobiological emergent narratives. Although I am critical of such accounts, I mention them here to mark the boundaries of this discussion. In the first case, natural law is operative through internal restraints, while in the second they are external, either as revealed (ontology of creation) or as emergent, evolutionary, or even socially constructed phenomena. Such judg ments depend on particular beliefs about the origin of and authority of such external rules. Traditionally, Roman Catholic teaching leans toward an inter pretation of natural laws as having an ontological basis in a doctrine of creation, thus linking natural law with divine fiat. Natural law understood in this way conflicts with dominant philosophical naturalism in secular ethics. Robert Audi believes naturalism approaches intellectual orthodoxy among philosophers in the West, so for him there are only some convincing versions of theologically orientated ethics.8 Evolutionary ethics, which Audi does not consider, is realist with respect to the psychological roots of human action, but antirealist when considering the ontological or normative basis for moral systems, making moral claims neither true nor false.9 Audi suggests that nonreductive ethical natural ism can anchor normative properties in the natural world without necessarily abandoning a theologically orientated ethics, so goodness and obligation still can be connected with natural properties without being reduced to them.10</page><page sequence="4">162 • Natural Law Revisited But what would a nonreductive ethical naturalism really look like in prac tice? Jean Porter's work on natural law in Nature as Reason is particularly illu minating for this discussion. Porter defends a naturalistic ethic but still works within a theistic perspective in the context of contemporary philosophical and scientific reasoning.11 She avoids imposing theological reasoning onto "recal citrant material" while at the same time being "responsive to relevant scientific perspectives."12 Finding creative ways through this labyrinth requires selectiv ity, but the revival of interest in natural law ranges far wider than theological or philosophical discourse, taking in lawyers, politicians, and activists. Porter's realist stance immediately creates common ground with most scientific practi tioners, so knowledge is not just constructed but represents genuine knowledge of the way things are. Few would go back to a rigid modernist understanding of natural law as a respectable alternative to traditional ecclesial authority.13 Postfoundational philosophy in theology and science pioneered by the work of Wentzel van Huyssteen unsettles premature statements.14 Porter is correct to claim that rejection of foundationalism need not equate with antirealism. Her retrieval of scholastic natural law shows that it is double edged. On the one hand, scholas tics perceived the "natural" in natural law as being much wider culturally than contemporary meanings given to "nature," so natural law embraced preconven tional grounds for moral norms, or reason as such, or even scripture.15 On the other hand, they were also prepared to understand the "natural" in natural law to include the pre-rational as well as rational elements, and hence searched for intelligibility in the natural world, with a focus on the wisdom rather than the power of God expressed in that world.16 For the scholastics, "human reason reflects the same intelligible structure of existence and action as are manifested in pre-rational animals, to which it brings understanding, and the possibilities of deliberate organized realization."17 Albertus Magnus's sense of continuities between humans and other animals is striking.18 For scholastics, therefore, such intelligibility does not mean that human beings are necessarily obliged to imi tate other animals, or that continuities necessarily reflect biological kinship with them.19 Their views are in one sense naturalistic but still resist presuppositions of evolutionary ethics. Laws of Nature and Natural Laws It is worth pausing on the theme of natural law through the lens of intelligibility since scientists commonly use laws of nature and sometimes even natural law to describe this feature of science. Physicist John Polkinghorne believes the term "law" is justified in science where there is evidence of an underlying ontologi cal structure; some facets are "revealed" to the scientist rather than being an</page><page sequence="5">Celia Deane-Drummond • 163 occasion of phenomenological adequacy.20 But he also admits of slippage in the use of the term "law"; further, what he terms "natural law" can be indicative of probabilistic tendencies toward chaos, as in the second law of thermodynamics, rather than reflecting any underlying regularities in structure.21 This goes back to Porter, namely, that realism does not necessarily mean fundamentalism. In the case of modern physics, for example, indeterminacy can be integral to intel ligibility. For Polkinghorne, "natural law" provides a metaphysical foundation for scientific laws of nature. For Niels Gregersen, such laws only arose in the early modern period when "naturalistic explanation was propelled by theologi cal assumptions."22 God, as the giver of the laws of nature, is then uncovered by discovering laws of science.23 Scientists in a post-Enlightenment context mean something different from scholastics when they speak of natural law; both search for intelligibility, though for different reasons. Once biological sciences come into the picture, "law" as implying fixed regularity becomes problematic. Biologist Jeffrey Schloss's discussion is perti nent.24 He offers four important observations. First, many generalizations used in biology are descriptive and contingent rather than law-like, in the sense of reflecting some kind of underlying structure.25 Second, most generalizations in biology have important exceptions.26 The law of natural selection seems like a tautology once it is couched in terms of survival of the fittest; "survival" means successful reproduction, as does "fittest," so what does survival of the fittest re ally mean? As Schloss states, "The Darwinian insight can be phrased simply as: The composition of a population will change in the direction of those entities that make more copies of themselves than others. But this could not possibly be false."27 It seems, then, that a logical truth is being co-opted as a biological law, leading to considerable doubts about the validity of naming evolution by natural selection a law at all! Third, phylogenetic survival does not just depend on natural selection; it also includes many other factors, some of which Schloss mentions—neutral variation, genetic drift, and contingent cataclysms—though I would also want to add behavioral factors. And so many biologists today are realizing that framing evolutionary biology exclusively through natural se lection will not suffice. Evolution is a complex interactive process between a number of different inheritance systems, genetics being only one of these.28 If behavior is important in the overall trajectory of evolutionary processes, as it seems to be, then individual agency once more becomes significant. Rather than a natural selection of traits where internal characteristics survive against an external background, there is reciprocal interaction and niche construction, providing a much richer evolutionary account. This raises a dilemma. If there are any law-like generalizations in biology, then they are only descriptive and inductive rather than being causal explana tions. Such laws are not constructed out of thin air but are arrived at through generalizations from detailed observations. The tension between morphologists,</page><page sequence="6">164 ■ Natural Law Revisited who historically insisted on essential structure, and teleologists, who preferred to highlight function, still persists in evolutionary debates. Michael Denton and Craig Marshall claim, "Physical laws must have had a far greater role in the evolution of biological form than is generally assumed. And it will mean a return to the pre-Darwinian conception that underlying all the diversity of life is a finite set of natural forms that will recur over and over again anywhere in the cosmos where there is carbon-based life."29 Functionalists, however, view any regularity as emerging from trade-offs between different possibilities according to the best function in a given set of conditions. Inasmuch as functionalist ap proaches imply directionality, it is better to name this "telonomy" rather than "teleology" since they eschew any notion of final causation. Natural Rights and Justice Natural law is complex in that within its scope there are not just internal and external facets but also, arguably, structural or functional dimensions, even though the topics of those structural or functional distinctions are inclusive of their cultural products. Scholastic natural law could be viewed as one more way to soften the post-Enlightenment divide between "natural" and "cultural" that has plagued biologists, social scientists, lawyers, and political scientists as well as theologians, philosophers, and humanities scholars. Natural right is structural in that it presupposes a principled basis of the good. It is functional in that it includes what it means for a society to function well in maintaining such individual human rights among its members. Porter's analysis of justice and natural rights claims shows that, until com paratively recently, scholars assumed that Aquinas did not have a concept of subjective natural rights but rather of the right, or the object of the virtue of justice, jus, according to objective standards of equity and nonmaleficence.30 Aquinas allows for subjective natural rights even if not as well developed as modern theory. More specifically, the scholastic jurists' conception of natural rights is reflected in their practices rather than specific theories, so they "re gard at least some appeals to right as discretionary claims" either through an obligation or duty to act in a certain way or through immunity from coercion.31 Wild Justice Wild justice is premised on the notion of fairness in social animals. The fact that something that looks like fairness is not evident in all animals should not concern us here; the point is that recognition of the presence of fairness across social species can impact on our sense of obligation to other animals. Ethologist</page><page sequence="7">Celia Deane-Drummond • 165 Marc Bekoff and philosopher Jessica Pierce have discussed social rules of animal societies in their book Wild Justice.32 In standard economic tests chimpanzees did show clear differences compared with humans in what they deemed "fair" and were willing to accept any offer from a partner. However, that does not mean that they do not have any sense of fairness.33 Bekoff and Pierce define what they term a "justice cluster" as those observ able behaviors found in social animals in relation to a sense of fairness, includ ing "a desire for equity and a desire for and capacity to share reciprocally"; reactions to equity in expressions of "pleasure, gratitude and trust"; and reac tions to inequity, including "retribution, indignation and forgiveness."34 Many biologists prefer to call such fairness "inequity aversion" rather than the more anthropomorphic language of "wild justice."35 The primary tool is cognitive ethology—animal behavior in their natural settings. Just as biologists are hesi tant to use the term "freedom," preferring the generic "agency," likewise most biologists studying social animals hesitate to use the term "justice." Bekoff and Pierce are prepared to go farther in using the term "wild justice" based on the following: (a) a keen sense of justice as fairness is universal in humans; (b) even very young prelinguistic babies have a strong sense of fairness; and (c) direct observation of animal behavior. While they press for evolutionary continuity, that can include divergence in what justice entails. It is significant, too, that just as cooperation has come into its own in contemporary evolutionary biology, fairness is also not simply an overlay that masks otherwise selfish tendencies. BekofPs close study of play behavior is particularly illuminating, for it pro vides an important bridge between a sense of fairness in individual animals and particular social rules that bears an analogy with aspects of natural rights and natural law. The rules of social play depend on fairness, cooperation, and trust. Accordingly, "during social play individuals can learn a sense of what's right and wrong—what's acceptable to others—the result of which is the development and maintenance of a social group (a game) that operates efficiently."36 Animals also learn to take turns and set up "handicaps" in order to make play fair between dif ferent ages or sizes. The rules of engagement include ways of agreeing to play, how hard to bite, avoiding mating attempts, minimizing assertion of dominance, and what to do in the event of a mistake. Play teaches its participants social skills and cements social bonds. By definition, play cannot be unfair since if it was, it would no longer be play but something else, such as coercion. Of course, in social animals the tendency to play "unfair" is still present, but the point is that when play leans in this direction, such as biting too hard among dogs, or inappropriate sexual advances, there has to be admission of wrong by the offending party, and then either a resumption of play or a refusal by the one who has been offended during play to carry on. There is even some evidence that play stimulates brain development in young animals and the growth of larger brains.37 Psychologist Gordon Burghardt finds evidence of play behavior one million years ago among</page><page sequence="8">166 • Natural Law Revisited placental mammals, birds, and even crustaceans.38 Bekoff recognizes that play be havior is distinct in tolerating capability differences. If, by definition, play cannot be unfair, then it is different from other collective social activities such as caregiv ing or hunting. Bekoff believes that this makes play a form of wild justice, "a set of social rules and expectations that neutralize differences among individuals in an effort to maintain group harmony."39 Is it reasonable to call such hints in the animal world "justice"? I believe that it is as long as its meaning is clear, and I believe that wild justice in animal so cieties is not intended to be identical to or necessarily precede that in humans. Porter locates Aquinas's interpretation of justice primarily as a capacity of the will "away from its more spontaneous orientation toward the agents' own good, so as to create a standing disposition to regard and pursue the good of others."40 One of the difficulties of any treatment of animal ethics, including animal rights approaches, is that adjudicating the intention of animals can only be approached with difficulty and indirectly. Yet even Aquinas argues that voluntarism of a par tial sort is found in other animals, even if not full blown and not with the delib erative capacity of the will.41 Now wild justice by definition cannot be premised on the kind of volitional decision making of humans. Fair play complicates even modest claims for such assertions in that the good of the agent matches the good of others; so it is good for all parties, including the most vulnerable. Hence, while a sense of fairness is certainly present, wild justice seems to lack a reflective and deliberative concern for the other that is integral to hu man justice. Sarah Brosnan and her colleagues have assembled good scientific evidence for "second-order fairness" in chimpanzees in experimental contexts. Second-order fairness is a technical term that means that the participants, in this case chimpanzees, show sensitivity to the way another neighbor chimpan zee is being treated. That sensitivity is expressed by refusing to cooperate with the researcher in a given task where that chimpanzee neighbor does not receive the anticipated reward.42 So those who received grapes (the preferred food) also reacted when their partners received a lower reward for doing the same task. This implies at least a second-order sense of fairness. Aquinas's belief that nonrational creatures only move toward perfection through spontaneous natural inclinations is complicated by BekofPs belief that play is chosen, even if humans choose more deliberately. So as humans can pursue perfection in a wrong way, other animals can pursue play in a wrong way also, and when they do, play is no longer play but something else. Mistakes are permis sible in play if they are admitted to; for dogs this would be through a repetition of a play bow, showing genuine intent to carry on with play, but if "offenses" are repeated, then play ceases. Human persons are, through their tendency to sin, according to Aquinas's view, even less capable of self-sacrifice than they would be in their "natural" state.43 Justice in human communities is both necessary in the light of human sin and capable of perfecting natural capacities of agents.</page><page sequence="9">Celia Deane-Drummond • 167 Natural Law and Positive Law Natural laws, as currently inscribed in many modern forms and insofar as they might seem to take their bearings from natural inclinations, could be viewed as providing a more conservative basis for ethics compared with legal positivism rooted in conventions and human will. This differs from scholastic accounts, which resisted any sharp divide between natural and positive law.44 At the same time, the moral obligation to respect positive law is not so much coerced as chosen if it is going to have moral weight. Ethical naturalists and evolution ary ethicists like Frans de Waal find continuities between human beings and primates not just in terms of inclinations to act in certain ways, to play fair, but also through particular social conventions or what could be termed chimpanzee "politics."45 De Waal is cautious about making direct claims for animal moral ity while insisting that morality found in human societies builds on common social emotions in other species.46 He is not so naive as to assume the two are identical, or that the global perspectives in ethics, for example, are not unique to human societies. Unjust "politics" in animal communities does not make sense, nor does some sort of deliberative positive law. He puts particular emphasis in his work on the more cooperative and empathetic aspects of primate behavior, especially that in bonobos, and is prepared to claim that humans have some thing to learn morally given that he rejects other sources of moral authority such as religious belief.47 His concept of a tower of morality leading eventually to human moral systems presupposes an emergent morality and thus does not give sufficient credit to the specificity of other animal social lives. So comparing human reasoning power with that of even the most advanced social species is inevitably going to put hu mans in a position of supremacy. Social conventions in animal societies are more like coercion; other animals do have reasoning powers, but their cognitive powers are more limited and less deliberative; support for any social animals having a theory of mind is still contested; there are certainly no religious or goal-directed aspects of justice or morality, and so on ad infinitum. This comparative narrative does not take us all that far in terms of articulating what human obligations to other animals might be like. De Waal's view collapses back into a rather uncon vincing evolutionary ethics. Agustin Fuentes, in a review of de Waal's most recent book, The Bonobo and the Atheist, captures this succinctly: de Waal fails to appreci ate that "the human lineage is characterized by a distinctive capacity to alter and shape our niche, by language, symbol, and meanings derived from more than the materiality of our social and ecological surroundings. Human moral systems do not need religion to exist, but they do need humans. In the end, bonobos cannot tell us very much about being human at all."48 But, like Fuentes, I suggest that they can tell us about being bonobos, and what fairness means in their world, separated as they are from humans by millions of years of evolutionary history.</page><page sequence="10">168 • Natural Law Revisited A systems approach may help put our own human capacities for moral agency and those of other animal societies in a broader perspective. Donella Meadows pioneered this approach, which has been around for over a quarter of a century but is not yet widely appreciated. Systems theory uses computer mod eling to envisage social and ecological systems and the relationships between them. A system is "a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever— interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time."49 Systems can change and, importantly, many include both human and nonhuman elements and may function in a way not intended by a single ac tor. Meadows claims: "The most stunning thing living systems and some social systems can do is to change themselves utterly by creating whole new structures and behaviors. In biological systems the power is called evolution. In human economics it is called technical advance or social revolution. In systems lingo it's called self-organization."50 And, importantly, it is the rules for self-organization that are responsible for the way that system changes. Rules are "high leverage points," so "power over rules is real power. ... If you want to understand the deepest malfunctions of systems, pay attention to the rules and to who has power over them."51 At the same time, self-organizing nonlinear feedback systems are unpredictable. Rather than trying to impose our will on a system, Meadows advises: "listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone."52 Complex systems, including ecological systems, can be viewed as demonstrating characteristics such as resilience, hierarchy, and self organization. Highly developed legal provision is deliberatively self-conscious rather than emergent in a way that regulatory devices in other animal communi ties are not, though impacts of positive law are also often unforeseen. Positive laws in such a perspective are regulating feedback devices operating in complex human systems, embedded in ecological systems, including those animal systems regulated by wild justice. Hence, a systems approach tries to view the way the planetary system as a whole works as a network of highly complex systems in a way that is inclusive of human interactions with the planet rather than assuming, as most humani ties scholars commonly do, that human social activity is separated from natural processes. Positive laws that contribute to social stability in an uncertain world therefore can be thought of as partially contributing to the resilience of a given social system by providing the kind of feedback that promotes societal peace rather than disunity. But systems thinking, in its emphasis on unpredictability, would remain cautious about naming given positive laws in terms of cause and predicted effect. Should moral theologians be concerned that a systems approach points to another form of ethical naturalism? As long as suitably qualified, there are</page><page sequence="11">Ceiia Deane-Drummond • 169 arguments that support the idea that a systems approach can give some useful insights about the unpredictability of human societies and a clearer recognition of entanglement between human, animal, and ecological systems. Some Steps toward Human Obligations to Other Animals This essay has presented an argument for closer attention to the social and moral lives of other animals, including wild justice, as a way of appreciating more deeply their worlds. Natural law, at least in its scholastic form, presupposes lines of con tinuity between other animals and humans and resists too sharp a separation of "nature" and "culture" while still retaining an emphasis on human reason and its eventual expression in positive laws. A systems approach, in its attempt to view social networks through systems logic, highlights the indeterminacy aspect of all complex systems and therefore qualifies human hubris. But, if wild justice is viewed as a regulating device, what might this suggest about human obligations to animals? The scholastic notion that intelligibility evident in natural law reflects the wisdom rather than the power of God is unfashionable when parsed as a crude version of natural theology. However, recognition of the proper regulatory func tion of animal societies in wild justice that are simultaneously interconnected with our own self-organizing systems should give us pause for thought. In other words, given the way human and animal communities are closely interlaced, it is inadequate to consider wild justice as cut off from human communities. Human action and interaction, including the laws generated in given human societies, dominate the life on the planet to such an extent that to name a specific conserva tion area "wild" or even a wild species "wild" is no longer fully convincing. The difference between the scholastic approach to natural law and reductive naturalism is that instead of equating moral properties with natural ones, natu ral properties, at least inasmuch as they point toward a teleological approach, open up a liminal space for the appearance of divine wisdom. That is why Albertus Magnus was so fascinated with the details of the lives of other animals and spent much energy on their intricate observation. Are such renditions of theological ethics an endorsement of naturalism? No; since as naturalism can be nonreductive, it is still qualified by a recognition that not all that we find in the natural world can be placed in the category of the good, and that humans are often obliged to make choices between good acts, so discernment is necessary even in making decisions about obligations to other animals. Charles Taylor contends that among the moral imperatives in modern cul ture is a demand for universal justice and beneficence. For him, moral sources operate in three domains: theistic, naturalistic (scientistic), and expressiv ist.53 Yet a more integrative way forward takes account of scholastic natural law, which is still sensitive to what can be known about the world without</page><page sequence="12">170 • Natural Law Revisited succumbing to the pretense of evolutionary ethics. Theological ethics insists that "good" is an ideal worth aiming for, and the shape of what that might look like in terms of our obligations to other animals as a bare minimum needs to be informed by what we know about their lives.54 To move toward what some of those legal obligations might look like in light of the above discussion, I will end with some practical suggestions about where priority needs to be given: 1. Legislation toward the protection of the social function of animal socie ties, including those living in national parks. 2. Legislation against those forms of animal husbandry that refuse to respect the social context of animal lives: factory farming, including battery caged chickens, pigs, cattle, etc. 3. Tighter legislation of commercial and private zoos so owners are obliged to care for animals in social settings that resemble more closely their natural states. 4. A legislative ban on hunting animals for pleasure or for nonessential products such as fur or horn, and a limitation by license on those com munities who hunt in order to meet their own survival needs. 5. Greater openness in labeling of consumer products that are reliant at different production stages on the cruel treatment of animals, including a denial of their social well-being—hence, the establishment of a Fair Treatment Index and not just a Fair Trade Index.55 6. Economic incentives built into legislation for those who change their practices, including, for example, tax breaks or other relevant economic measures. 7. Tighter international legislation to protect the movement of animals be tween nations. 8. Stronger international agreements on animal welfare, where there would be penalties (such as trade sanctions) for noncompliance. Notes I thank the editors of this journal and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, and David Clairmont for prompting me to write on this topic. 1.

The choice between them can only be made on metascientific grounds, such as judgements of economy, elegance, and 'natural ness' (the absence of manifest contrivance)"; Polkinghorne, "The Character of the Laws of Nature," 16.</page><page sequence="14">172 • Natural Law Revisited 22. Niels Henrik Gregersen, "From Laws of Nature to Nature's Capacities: A Theological Thought Experiment," in Concepts of Law in the Sciences., Legal Studies, and Theology, ed. Michael Welker and Gregor Etzelmiiller (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2013), 109. 23. Gregersen resists the idea of natural theology as providing proofs for the existence of God. He holds back, therefore, from giving such laws a strong theological warrant. So, "Offering a fitting meta-scientific interpretation does not imply that there could not be other reason able truth candidates, for example, that the existence of the laws of nature is simply a brute fact (beyond which one should not speculate) or a result of a cosmic lottery in which we, as sentient beings, just happen to be the lucky winners." Hence, while Polkinghorne sides with Theism, Gregersen is also prepared to wager that Brute Fact Empiricism or Lady Luck Hypothesis (terms that he uses) are three rival metaphysical candidates for truth.

An example of this might be the universal use of L-amino acids in protein synthesis. 26. The so-called cell law—that every cell comes from a cell—must have had an origin in noncellular life unless the emergence of life is denied. 27. Schloss, "Laws of Life," 65. 28.

The suggestion is that the index, once agreed upon through an analogous political process to fair trade, would permit easy consumer evaluation of products that are deliberately committed to animal welfare according to specific recog nized standards. The Fair Treatment label would therefore indicate more than simply "organic" on food or other products that use parts of animal bodies.</page></plain_text>
