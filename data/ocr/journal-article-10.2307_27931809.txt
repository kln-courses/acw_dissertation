<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Terracotta Horse in Stellenbosch and the Iconography and Function of Palestinian Horse Figurines By Izak Cornelius 1. Description A terracotta animal figurine (ca. 6.3 cm long and 6cm high; Taf. 4A-B) from the collection of 'Iziko Museums of Cape Town' (item 1429; PI. 1) is currently on display in the "Living Antiquity" exhibition of the Department of Ancient Studies in the 'Sasol Art Museum' of the University of Stellenbosch1. It is a quadruped animal with a straight back and a pair of ears, described as a "dog" in the 'Iziko Museums of Cape Town records'. However, the figurine is part of the well-known tradition of terracotta horses in ancient Palestine. The provenance is unknown, but it is clearly of Palestinian origin and can be dated - when compared with other items from a stratified context - as from the 8th - 7th centuries b.c.e. The horse is without a rider. The rider might be lost as horses with riders are common2. Such figurines were made by hand; the animal and rider were made in two separate parts. The animal has a smooth back, which differentiates it from the hump-backed bovine figurines. The mouth of the horse is longish, as are the ears. There is no disk on the head; it is without trappings, with a plain muzzle, which was the most common type of horse figurine. Accord ing to Holland's typology3 it is similar to type Dia ("horses without trappings", with a plain muzzle without incised or applied features). This is the most common type of faunal figurine and was confined to southern Palestine west of the Jordan4. 2. Comparisons5 Previous studies on Palestinian and Jordanian terracottas6 looked at figurines of horses7 and horses with riders (with other horses included the number of figurines can be about 500). Type D ("solid hand-modelled horses and riders") in the collection of holland has 328 items, with 121 from Jerusalem8. Jordanian examples were collected by cAmr9. Holland 1 The illustrations are published with kind permission of 'Iziko Museums of Cape Town'. 2 MOOREY 2003, 61: "an unknown number of surviving horses may originally have carried riders". 3 Holland 1975 I, 229 and II, 30-32. 4 Holland 1977, 148. 5 For animals in ancient art in general cf.

One inscribed horse head from Samaria has the name of the owner11. There are horses without riders and with them from Lachish, as well as horses' heads12. Other animals were also depicted in clay, most notably the bull or bovine figure 13 and the dog with which the figurine under discussion might be confused. In the corpus of figurines from Horbat Qitmit published by Beck there are two objects which might represent a reclin ing bull and a dog14. The bull (9cm long) has a humped back with one horn missing. The dog (7cm long) has a long neck and muzzle, with a tail and broken ears. a clay figurine of a man on a donkey goes back to Early Bronze Hirbet ez-Zeraq?n15. Terracotta figurines of lions are not really known16 although Holland's catalogue has some heads 17. The lion figurine in Keel/Uehlinger is of unknown provenance, said to come from Hebron18. The remaining surviving tail makes one doubt whether it is original. Figurines of cats are rare but known from Persian Beth-Gan and from E -Z?b19. The Stellenbosch figurine is not a bull, which has clear horns and a back which is not straight20. The object is also definitely not a dog. Terracotta figurines of dogs look different, as shown by examples collected by holland as type GIc21. The figurine is very similar to horse figurines with a rider, as shown by the excellent comparative examples from Lachish22 and an example of a horse with rider in the collection of the Fribourg Bibel + Orient Mu seum 23. The horse in Fribourg and the Lachish example have longer muzzles when compared to the Stellenbosch specimen. 3. Context, Purpose and Function miller24 has argued that, when interpreting figurines, one has to differentiate carefully between the context, which is not only the broader cultural context, but also the specific find context (the microcontext); after that the function of the object should be studied - its use and meaning. moorey25 has also made an important comment: "terracottas do not have inherent meanings independent from their historically specific contexts of production and use". 10Holland 1975 I, 239 (DXIa); Gilbertz-Peretz 1996, 37-39, Fig. 16; PI. 6 (type B2). 11 Crowfoot 1957, Pl. 13 No. 3 (M 62). 12 TXjfnell 1953, Pis. 27,5 and 32,5; 27,2; 29,17-18 (riders); 33 (later period); 32 (heads) and now Kletter 2004, 2059-2064. 13 cAmr 1980, 190-213; Holland 1975 I, 247-251 (Type F).

ZDPV 123 (2007) 1</page><page sequence="3">30 Izak Cornelius Unfortunately the find context of the Stellenbosch horse is unknown. In his book on the terracottas moorey26 argues that the best scenario would be a good archaeological assem blage of examples, rather than scattered isolated pieces. Horse-and-rider figurines come from houses, but only five examples come from tombs21. The horse figurines from Jerusalem come from the controversial cave 1, which Kenyon and Holland identified as a favissa for a sanctuary (albeit non-official)28. But this has been disputed29. The question that has to be answered is whether the figurine represents a deity, and if so, which type of deity. There are two views in the literature: a sun god or a warrior god. There is no clear cultic context for any of the horse figurines and we have to turn to comparative iconography. Deities on animals are common in Ancient Near Eastern and Pal estinian iconography, mostly standing on animals and to a lesser extent riding animals. The Maltaya relief30 shows a whole series of deities standing on animals, among them the sungod Shamash on horseback (third deity from the right)31. A winged figure standing on a horse and a winged disc above a winged horse are shown on cylinder seals32. Other well-known deities standing on animals are Ishtar33 and Qedeshet (but not Ashe rah)34 on the lion, and the weather god on the bull35. Examples from Palestine include the stone figurine on a bull from Hazor/Tell el-QedahlHirbet Waqq?s, a figurine on a bull on a bronze plaque from Dan/7e// el-Q?d?, and a goddess (presumably Ishtar) on a metal pendant from Ekron/Tel Miqne IHirbet el-Muqannac36. holland included a type DXV ("riders standing on horse")37, but the examples are too unclear to be certain. Deities riding animals are less attested: Amurru on a mule38, and Astarte (but not Anat) riding a horse39. In the Ugarit myths Athirat rides on a donkey40, but the iconography is unknown. wenning41 has argued that the horse-rider could be related to the Pillar figurines, form ing a divine male-female pair42, but this has generally been rejected43. The Pillar figurines have been identified with the goddess Asherah44, but there are no divine attributes to make them represent a goddess. 26 Moore 2005, 4-5. 27Bloch-Smith 1992, 102; Tufnell 1953, Pis. 28-30. 28 Holland 1977, 154. 29 Cf.

ZDPV 123 (2007) 1</page><page sequence="4">A Terracotta Horse in Stellenbosch and the Function of Palestinian Horse Figurines 31 Horses with disks 45 are known and some authors have argued that this is to be linked with the "horses" and "chariots of the sun" as described in 2 Kgs 23:1146 (cf. Ps 68:1 and Hab 3:8.15). One much discussed item from Cave 1 at Jerusalem from the 7th century was pub lished by Dame Kenyon and she suggested that there is a sundisk between the ears, con necting it with the horses of the sun in the temple in Jerusalem47. Ahlstr?m went further and linked it with YHWH48. We know from Mesopotamian iconography that the sungod was connected with horses, as indicated above. But Palestinian horse figurines with disks are rare 49. There is also no clear reason to identify the disk with the sun or as a solar emblem as such. Much clearer is the horse with a sundisk on the upper part of the Taanach cult stand50. Some have argued that the horse-and-rider figurines represent a warrior god - perhaps Baal or even YHWH51. Recently dever52 linked them with "the horses and chariots of the sun" and the god Baal as "Cloud rider", referring to the Ugaritic ("Canaanite mythology") texts. It is not so easy to link these Bronze Age texts with 8 th - 7 th centuries Palestine53. Baal is also no equestrian deity, but a driver or charioteer of the clouds54. The deities in the Ugaritic texts linked with horses are rather Astarte and Resheph55. Uehlinger made the figurines "a divine protector or conspicuous member of the host of heaven"56 (cf. Isa 13:4), the figurines having a function in expressing family piety57. There is no clear indication that the horse figurines are to be identified with deities, because there are no divine attributes on the riders58. They are rather representations of ordinary people as cavalry, with the horse as an elite symbol59 (cf. Ezek 23:6) - especially in a period when horse-riding and cavalry as part of warfare came to the fore. A horse-figurine from Achzib shows a warrior with a shield60. The origin of cavalry is in the northern steppe from where it spread to Kush and later Assyria61, but it was not that common in ancient 45 Holland 1975 I, 233 (DVd). 46 Cf.

Under the Persians cavalry became more common as the large number of equestrian figurines from this period attest to63. It is not impossible that the horse figurines also functioned as toys 64 - the fifth (but not the only) functional category for terracottas65. 4. Conclusion The horse and horse-and-rider terracotta figurines are an important part of the iconographical repertoire of Palestinian and more specifically Judaean art, forming a unique Judaean type 66. This is especially interesting in the light of the lack of male figurines in contrast to the abundance of female ones 61. What exactly they represent is still under discussion. An iden tification with some god is less likely and the link with the sun cult should not be exagger ated. That they are some elite symbol linked with a new form of warfare seems plausible.
