<plain_text><page sequence="1">A DATABASE OF IMPORTS IN THE CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN: A DESCRIPTION AND SOME METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS Richard Fletcher I take it for granted that we can read this non-verbal language best if ... we collect all the evidence to find out what belongs to a general pattern and what is unique, and the temporal and spatial scales on which processes operated.1 INTRODUCTION During the Early Iron Age and the Archaic period, the central Mediterranean was the scene of revolutionary changes and rapid development within the various cultural entities of Italy, Sardinia, and Sicily. It was this region that saw Greek settlement in South Italy and Sicily, Phoenician colonization in Sicily and Sardinia, and the beginnings of trade and contact between the cultures of the region and those of the East, with a subsequent exchange of technology, material, and ideas. The effects on the local populations of contacts with Greeks and Levantines as well as the equally important effects of western trade and colonization in the Greek and Levantine homelands were considerable. So much we can read from the evidence as we have it. Yet, our understanding of the mechanisms of trade and the means of exchange, not to mention the scope of their effects, remains relatively poor. Past approaches have been largely to blame for this, since they have always been piecemeal, lacking in methodological soundness, often theoretically weak, and sometimes little more than speculative. This fragmentary and disparate character of the study of ancient trade, it must be conceded, is easily understandable. The period of history in question is itself already marked by relatively partial and disconnected archaeological evidence, which by its nature tends to discourage many attempts at synthesis across regional boundaries. Further, the elusive quality of the evidence suppresses all but a few restricted theoretical models; theoretical perspectives which are more confidently explored in other historical areas founder upon a lack of empirical data, and this same lack generates an assumption that nothing resembling a theory might ever be drawn from the data itself. It is perhaps also true, in a more basic way, that studies which seek to deal comprehensively with many regional and cultural units in their network of interaction, and to track the shifts in this network over a period of centuries, belong more properly to an earlier period of archaeological inquiry. Broadly framed 'era-studies' were a hallmark of the Enlightenment tradition, and any return to that sort of perspectival breadth, with all its disciplinary baggage of Eurocentric colonialism, may well appear at least regressive if not actually inappropriate. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that there are two works to which this study is very much in debt: Fernand Braudel's La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l'époque de Philippe II (1949) and Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell's The Corrupting Sea: A Study in Mediterranean History (2000). 1 I.

MEDITARCH 18, 2005,1-30</page><page sequence="2">2 Richard Fletcher At the same time, however, the scholarship of this period is underwritten by certain burning questions which, though generally pervasive in all areas of archaeological research, are particularly controversial, and thus also inflammatory, in studies of the Early Iron Age and the Archaic periods. The movement of peoples and the circulation of goods and ideas were such that, between the beginning and the end of this phase of history as we define it, part of the world was entirely and essentially changed. The apparent fact that these sweeping transformations occurred in the context of an escalation of trading activity brings, in the light of our own era of global economics, a new urgency to the desire to perceive and understand what happened. The present study centres upon a database of imported material in the Italian peninsula, Sardinia, and Sicily dating from approximately 800 to 500 bc, which has been constructed in order to study trade in this region. The database stands at a little over 40,000 objects. It includes artefacts imported from the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean, encompassing the Levant, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia. It remains, of course, a rough sketch of the true picture, and much has almost certainly been missed. However, making a database of imported objects into the central Mediterranean region, and undertaking a study of the methodology dealing with the statistical problems of such an endeavour, is an attempt to rectify a few of the shortcomings of past scholarship. It is the basis for a re-examination of the problem of the beginnings of trade and contact. To understand trading patterns in the period, to comprehend the external relations of Italian peoples, and to explain how cultures from the Eastern Mediterranean became so influential and mobile, one would think such a study imperative. Yet, it would appear that so far no such study has ever been attempted. One of the distortions of the archaeological study of trade and, in particular, patterns of trade in the pre-Classical period, is that previous studies have almost invariably been restricted to single categories of material, the particular category being determined by the particular interest of the scholar concerned. As such, studies have been selective and limited. Archaeologists find themselves debating the important issues of this period based almost entirely upon different and partial sets of data. One may look at the distribution of Phoenician silver vessels to predicate one argument, while another may make use of scarabs and amulets to make a contradictory argument.2 The same may very easily be said for investigations into the distribution of Corinthian or Euboean or any other type of Greek pottery. These have sometimes even been limited to particular subcategories, such as aryballoi or kotylai/skyphoi, and have failed to take others into account.3 Our picture of trade in the Early Iron Age and Archaic periods has been made up by piecing together regional studies, studies based upon limited sets of artefacts, and sometimes upon rather vague conjectural investigations.4 The result has been a jumble of conflicting ideas, systems, and proposed patterns. It has also led to a debate which often focuses not upon the essential wider picture but upon details of primacy, functionality, and simplistic and deterministic modelling. By making a catalogue of imports in the Italian peninsula regardless 2 See, for the former, G. E. Markoe, 'In Pursuit of Silver: Phoenicians in Central Italy', in: H. G. Niemeyer-R.

The study does not attempt to construct single-handedly a new theoretical model. What is offered here is an initial stage of the labour of bringing together the firmest basic evidence of Iron Age and Archaic trade. Over and above the evaluation of current ideas and the illumination of new ones, this study is an open demonstration of the utility of the database as a tool for further research. Even at this preliminary stage of refinement, and even with the necessary suspension of many questions which could have been (and can yet be) put to it, the database will demonstrate its value in testing ideas and models, illustrating unforeseen patterns, and generating new theories. THE DATABASE The catalogue has been put together from available publications. It uses a Microsoft Access platform, with several tables enabling the database to be linked to a Maplnfo GIS (Geographical Information System). The tables are: Artefacts, Pictures, Bibliography, Authors, Sites, Journals, Notes, and Totals (fig. 1). Naturally, it is the Artefacts table which is of greatest importance. This table contains entries in which each item is described in terms of origin, date, provenance, category, bibliographic information. A brief description is added where necessary, with the relevant inventory number from the museum or collection where the artefact is kept. Below are examples of the main page and Artefact page of the database. As can be seen from fig. 2, for each artefact there is information in five sections: artefact information, site information, date, bibliography, and notes. Artefact information contains nine fields. The 'Category' field divides entries into a number of categories such as 'Drinking Vessels', 'Perfume Vessels', 'Pouring Vessels', 'Amulets', 'Scarabs', and so on. The 'Sub-category' field enables a more detailed description, so that a 'drinking vessel' may be described as an 'Achaean kantharos', or an 'amulet' as a 'Wedjat-eye'. The 'Material' field will obviously contain terms such as 'ceramic', 'bronze', 'composition', or 'faience'. 'Artefact Use' describes the context of the object in the three basic categories of 'funerary', 'domestic', and 'ritual', while the 'Burial' field allows more detail in the type of burial: such as 'pithos-cremation', 'fossa', and so on. The 'Origin' field gives the proposed region of origin for the artefact in terms of say 'Attica', 'Corinth', or 'Egypt'. 'Grouping' allows for classification in terms of some general conditions such as 'domestic' and 'transport', and allows for some others such as 'ornament'. 'Site Information' contains four fields. The 'Site' field gives the commonly used name of the site, e.g. Cerveteri rather than Caere. In the 'Province' field the modern regions of Italy are named (e.g. Puglia rather than Apulia, Lazio instead of Latium, etc.). 'Find Date' is self explanatory, but 'Location' describes the context of the find in more detail, giving the tomb, sanctuary, or other details of the find location. 'Date' contains seven fields and is the most difficult section. The 'Probable Date' field indicates a likely date within the given range for use in the illustration of the data in the GIS. Thus, for an EPC aryballos of an early type which may be thought to have a chronological range of 720 to 700 bc, 710 may appear in the 'Probable Date' field. This will allow a database query in a search for any artefacts dated from 725 to 700 to select this aryballos. A similar system is applicable using the date ranges. The term 'date' must remain, for the purposes of this database, rather loose. It is well known that archaeological dating almost always leaves a margin of error of at least a quarter of a century,5 and much of the material 5 R. M.

Artefact form.</page><page sequence="5">A Database of Imports in the Central Mediterranean 5 from the Early Iron Age and Archaic periods can only be dated to a 50-year period, although there are considerable quantities of artefacts that require a date range of even a century or more. Examples may include the Ionic bucchero alabastra often found in late 7th-century and early 6th-century contexts in Italy, which in the absence of any other material can rarely be dated better than the period 620-550 bc.6 Therefore, the Date Range field was included to allow the depiction of chronological units of size (i.e. greater than 25 years) that may not allow for a probable date to be approximated, while still allowing database queries to select the artefact within date range queries. Similarly, a Chronology field allows for the subdivision of data into wider chronological units, such as the various divisions of the Corinthian chronology or the Egyptian Dynasties. Thus, when a Corinthian globular aryballos is reported to date to the first decade of the 7th century it can be assigned a Probable Date of 695, a Date Range of 700-690, and a Chronology of EPC. This will enable queries to be written in the SQL (Standard Query Language) format in either the database or the GIS, which would include this aryballos in any query of the Probable Date field either by decade (should one be so daring), or by quarter-century. It will also enable the results to be displayed in various chronological blocks using the Date Range field, such as a three-tiered approach in which 50-year periods are displayed as overlapping units, 100-year periods similarly displayed as overlaps, and larger chronological units such as Early Iron Age or Archaic. Any other such division may be used.

Chronological divisions. It is desirable that the body of available material be quantified and analysed in quantitative terms. For some fundamental aspects of the quantification, however, the data would seem heterogeneous, and may present problems as one attempts to classify them into categories which are comparable through statistics. Dates present significant difficulties. To compare an Early Corinthian vessel whose date is expressed in terms of a quarter century (i.e. the 4th quarter of the 7th century) with an Ionic bucchero alabastron, which would not normally be dated more precisely than 620-550 bc, should produce a problem in statistical comparison. However, this is illusory. The fact remains that both the EC object and the Ionic bucchero object exist. The problem lies with the assignation of a probable date for each item and the analysis of patterns resultant upon the numbers of vessels or objects so assigned. If one uses the overlapping sequences shown above in Table 1, on the basis of probable dates, or upon date ranges when these fit within the sequence, then there is no such suspicion of statistical incompatibility. 6 M. Martelli Cristofani, 'La ceramica greco-orientale in Etruria', in: Les céramiques de la Grèce de l'Est et leur diffusion en Occident (1978) 176-8.</page><page sequence="6">6 Richard Fletcher To use the example of the Ionic bucchero and EC vessel, comparison is possible when using date ranges only when one considers the century period 650-550, and not in those cases when using 650-600, 625-575, and 600-550. But if the Ionic bucchero alabastron was found with material that enables a probable date to be fixed in the last quarter of the 7th century (which is often the case with material, for example, from tombs at Taranto), then that alabastron may be used in the analysis of material not only in the period 650-550, but also in the shorter periods 650-600 and 625-575. Problems related to chronology, place of manufacture, function, and other aspects of the dataset are discussed below, as are the solutions and compromises that have been made to allow their conclusion and comparison. The chronology used throughout the catalogue is basically the Schweitzer/Payne/ Coldstream system.7 There are instances, however, when a lower chronology is adopted.8 These changes do not, however, seriously affect the collection made here since they are usually of the order of no more than 5 to 15 years. The chronology for East Greek material follows that of E. Langlotz, with the exception that Fikellura is now considered to have begun a little earlier (550 bc) than the date he proposed.9 The purpose of these numerous categories and subcategories in their various forms is to supply the maximum amount of information for each artefact in a categorized system such that the information may be used by SQL (Standard Query Language) queries to give results in terms of these categories. Thus searches may be made in terms of a subcategory such as 'kotyle' and in terms of a date range such as 650-600 bc, or any other variable. The design of the database therefore allows complex and adjustable queries based on any number or variation of categories and the subsequent display of such queries in GIS platforms. The 'Bibliography' field lists the published primary source(s) of information on the artefact as well as any additional references. 'Notes': this section contains the 'Picture' field which gives a link to an illustration of the object if this is considered useful, keeping in mind that pictures are not always available and that their storage in the database takes up a great deal of space. BIASES IN THE RECORD Biases in this database begin with the archaeological record itself. The most obvious aspect of the record is that it consists only of what has survived. We have evidence that traders in this period carried slaves, textiles, garum, wine, oil, foodstuffs, dye, and construction materials, in addition to the pottery and Aegyptiaca that is often all that is left for us to find.10 Bias begins even before excavation: when deciding to excavate, the archaeologist either chooses a site based upon the expectation of finding significant material, or is following up a chance 7 For a most convenient summary of this system, see J. Savage, 'Corinthian and Corinthianizing Pottery in the University of Queensland', Meditarch 2, 1989, 158-61; for a critical assessment of the assumptions on which it is based, see J.-P. Descœudres, 'Die vorklassische Keramik aus dem Gebiet des Westtors', in: Eretria.

This choice will introduce biases of several kinds: the type of site (necropolis, settlement, ritual, etc.), the area (coastal, inland, colonial, native, etc.), the topography, and even the geology and soil type. All of these factors will have significant effects upon what is recovered from the site, its visibility, and its state of preservation. Then there is the retrieving of this evidence through excavation, with its own baggage of biases: the contexts of the artefacts, their identification, dating, publication (or lack thereof), loss in store. Furthermore, and without going into too much detail, there will be biases inherent in the excavation process in the technique chosen, the procedure for discards, the sorting process, and the individual expertise of the excavators. The excavations at Pithekoussai may be taken as example to illustrate this point. The choice to concentrate efforts upon the necropolis certainly had much to do with the circumstances at the site, but it also reflected the excavators' belief (at the time) that the proper role of archaeology was the study of objects.11 Objects are, of course, best studied when they are recovered in the reasonable (largely intact) condition that one usually finds in graves. The geology of the site was also significant since the necropolis was situated upon a thermal zone with temperatures of up to 63° C, which had a detrimental effect upon the state of preservation of the pottery.12 Soil conditions at other sites have adversely affected the condition of pottery and its decoration.13 Even when conditions are easier, soil type and sherd colour can have an effect upon the visibility of pottery.14 Unfortunately, nothing can be done to remove these biases from the existing record. However, when one examines the treatment of evidence after excavation, distortions which are both more serious and more easily avoided become apparent. One of the most obvious biases has been the practice of treating certain classes of artefacts in different ways. In the field of ceramic studies, for instance, it is conventional for the various wares to be studied separately. Similarly, Aegyptiaca will often be divided up between amulets, scarabs, and other material. While this often results in nothing more than an inability to study the relative frequency of these artefacts in proportion to the total assemblage at a site, it can sometimes mean that certain artefact categories are underrepresented since their study has been neglected.15 One example of this would be the study of transport amphorae. For a long time, classical archaeology has been mainly concerned with the history of ancient art, with the result that artefacts with little or no artistic 'merit' have not received anywhere near the attention that has been given to decorated pottery. Thus, it is only relatively recently that transport amphorae have become the subject of serious study and, presumably, much evidence has in the past been discarded or lost.16 Similarly, a good deal of Italian archaeology, particularly in Etruria, has for much of its history focused upon funerary evidence, a state of affairs closely connected with archaeologists' interest in art history.17 If not funerary, then archaeology in Italy has had for a 11 D. and F.

A. Lloyd calls 'the busy countryside' has often been overlooked and, despite increased interest in survey in the last three decades, there remains a suspicion that imported material outside graves and the larger settlements is underrepresented.19 Thus traditions in archaeology and historiography have contributed to the distortion of the entire dataset. IDENTIFICATION While such traditions have contributed to our problems in obtaining a reliable set of data with which to work, they are, fundamentally, problems of perspective, in the sense that they are about tradition and, in a sense, fashion. Other distortions can exist in the dataset as a result of problems with the treatment of information. An obvious example is the identification of the artefacts themselves. It is only natural that over the course of the last century or more our knowledge of pottery and artefact types, their chronology, sources, and distributions, should have improved. Some examples are our better understanding of Euboean and Cycladic pottery,20 improvements in our knowledge of Corinthian material,21 and the identification of Phoenician pottery in Etruria and Campania.22 Probably even better known are those types of pottery which we can now be fairly certain are not Greek: 'Chalcidian', 'Caeretan', and 'Pontic'.23 Naturally, it has been the normal practice in the writing of the database to use the most recent publications, and artefacts published in the 19th and early 20th centuries have been checked either in the original publication or in the relevant museum storerooms. Another problem with identification has been the origin of the material. This is particularly so with early pottery such as the 8th-century drinking vessels from Etruria and Campania. The identification of Euboean, Attic, and Corinthian material in the western Mediterranean can at times be controversial.24 It can also be extremely difficult to distinguish between imported material and local production—a case in point being provided by Ionian cups25—especially if one assumes that clay may sometimes have been imported from Greece.26 18 M.

'East Greek' pottery is said to be anything from the west coast of Turkey and nearby islands (e.g. Rhodes and Cos, Samos, Chios, Miletus) and the marbled ware that may be from Lydia. Identifying the origin of objects said to be 'East Greek' is not the least of the problems. As R. M. Cook has put it: 'From want of evidence, and also of interest, East Greek pottery has not been studied with the same success as that of other Greek regions'.27 The result is a confused terminology where 'Fikellura' pottery has actually been identified as being from Miletus, and the seeming importance of Rhodes has been disproved by physical analysis of pots.28 Similarly there are various terms for the transport amphorae from this region, with 'Ionian' vying with 'East Greek', while it was not until 1971 that Samian transport amphorae were properly identified.29 For every disagreement about identification, however, there are several about chronology. Most of these are resolved by simply following the chronological framework as described above. However, there are occasions when recent scholarship requires objects from older publications to be reassigned dates. Examples such as Corinthian LG and EPC kotylai come to mind, where J.-P. Descoeudres,30 followed by P. Courbin,31 has shown that some vessels thought to have been datable on the basis of decoration should be dated in terms of shape. More difficult to resolve are debates concerning as yet unpublished material. In such cases, there was no choice other than to use the dates indicated by the excavator(s).32 This brings us to the difficulties presented by lack of publication and incomplete publication, represented in the enormous quantity of material stored in museums throughout Italy. In order to make the database as thorough as possible it would be preferable to include every imported object found in Italy and the islands, but it should be clear that no such database is in fact possible. There are several reasons for this, the most obvious being that mistakes will always creep into such a huge endeavour and pieces will be overlooked. But there are also the constraints of time and expertise. To investigate the storerooms of all the museums of Italy would be a work of decades (even if one were able to obtain the necessary permissions), and the expertise necessary for a thorough investigation would be beyond any one individual. This does not mean that no attempt should be made, but it should be noted that unpublished material in museum storerooms is, strictly speaking, an addition to our knowledge of material from the central Mediterranean rather than a collection of known material. From a methodological standpoint, unpublished material can be seen as equal to material still in the ground. Therefore the failure to include such material does not in itself invalidate the database, it merely illustrates how much more might be done by scholars in the future. CHRONOLOGY The Schweitzer/Payne/Coldstream system has already been mentioned as the basic chronological structure used in this study, with that of E. Langlotz for the East Greek material. That these systems have continued in use for most of the last 75 years is remarkable, even with the minor modifications over the last two generations of scholarship—usually of no more than 25 years. C. Tilley has pointed out that the 'truth' of a proposition in archaeology 27 Cook-Dupont op. cit. (η. 9) 5. 28 Ibid. 77. 29 V. Grace, 'Samian Amphoras', Hesperia40,1971,52-95. 30 J.-P.

An understanding of the absolute chronology of the earliest Greek or Levantine presence in the central Mediterranean in the Early Iron Age cannot be precise or thorough. We might, with the evidence that we have, place the earliest eastern traders in the West somewhere between the middle of the 9th and the middle of the 8th century, but beyond that we cannot go with any degree of certainty. Second, any attempt to place Levantines or Greeks as one preceding the other is equally impossible. The relative sequence for Greek pottery may be known in this period, but that for Levantine pottery, scarabs, and amulets is less securely understood, and is often dependent upon the Greek pottery sequence. Finally, a reasonably reliable absolute chronological framework from about 700 bc onwards will allow a reconstruction of trading patterns from this date. In summary, orthodox chronology may be accepted as it is but care must be taken to work through disagreements in publications, and particular care taken to remain cautious as regards the absolute chronology of material in the 8th century. PROVENANCING To identify the origin of artefacts listed in the database we have, as a rule, adopted the opinion put forward by its excavator and/or publisher, or the most recent review of such publication. This obviously presents us with the question of how well we might rely upon such information. The answer must be that it is not always as reliable as it might be, but to check every artefact is impossible, and even to check those one might consider doubtful would require a degree of expertise in fabrics, decoration, manufacture, and distribution beyond any one scholar. One may only point out the doubts and difficulties and endeavour to keep these in mind in any analysis of the results. As regards origins, one may identify several areas of difficulty: 1. Euboean and Cycladic material in the 8th century; 2. Some questions regarding Attic and Corinthian material in the same period; 3. The origin of Levantine material in general and artefacts in the Levantine style in faience; 4. The identification of local imitations of Greek pottery or of local production, particularly in terms of Ionian cups; 5. The identification of imported material, particularly that of the 8th century, in its correct chronological sequence, since identifying the origin of such objects will have implications for their chronology. Euboean and Cycladic It has already been stated that it has been the practice in the writing of the database to use the most recent publications and that checks have been made where possible. However, this glosses over the inherent problems in the identification of Euboean and Cycladic material, which must include both the identification of such material and the lack of identification. It is a point which should be stressed: Euboean and Cycladic material was not well known 33 A point made by Morris art. cit. (η. 8) 51; C. Tiiley, 'Introduction: interpretation and a poetics of the past', in: C. Tiiley (ed.), Interpretative Archaeology (1994) 6. 34 See, e.g., Descoeudres art. cit. (η. 7) 50-3. 35 Morris art. cit.

One may accept with some confidence the word of acknowledged and experienced experts and, possibly to a lesser extent, the studies of those archaeologists working in areas where there are numerous examples of Euboean material. However, material in other areas may be overlooked because of a lack of proficiency in the identification of Euboean material. An example may be the case of Calabria, where the total of Euboean and/or Cycladic artefacts from this whole region is just one, an oinochoe from Reggio Calabria (inv. 1302). While the situation is different in Campania, the identification of Euboean material from this region is not without uncertainty. The Euboean material from Ischia and Pontecagnano has been thoroughly studied,36 but the material from other sites in Campania, such as Cumae and Capua, was excavated and published before Euboean material was well understood. Some questions along the same lines should be directed towards the identification of Euboean material in Etruria at sites other than Veii.37 Early Attic and Corinthian The identification of Attic and Corinthian pottery from the Late Geometric period onwards may be considered reasonably secure. By the middle of the 8th century, both fabrics are distinctive and easily identified, and this is so particularly in the case of Corinthian.38 However, sometimes fragments, whatever their date, can raise difficulties in identification and dating, as an example from Fani may illustrate.39 Another case of a possible misidentification is the chevron skyphos (inv. 189506) from Capua gr. 800, defined by W. Johannowsky as Attic MG II,40 which a comparison with examples from the Agora at Athens (e.g. Agora Ρ 5071) seems to confirm.41 Yet, the examination which the author had the opportunity to carry out revealed that the fabric of the Capua skyphos is unequivocally Corinthian. There may well be other instances when MG material has been incorrectly identified. Levantine The identification of scarabs and amulets has been undertaken by G. Hôlbl and thoroughly documented.42 While Hôlbl's proposals in regards to origin are followed, there remain questions about the identification of Levantine as opposed to East Greek faience. V. Webb, for example, would regard anthropomorphic perfume vessels (e.g. Villa Giulia Inv. gen. 44.843) as usually East Greek,43 while A. Rathje44 and F. W. von Bissing,45 as Hôlbl,46 consider them 36 See J. Ν. Coldstream, 'Euboean Geometric Imports from the Acropolis of Pithekoussai', BSA 90, 1995, 251-67 and, for Pontecagnano, B. d'Agostino,'Relations between Campania, Southern Etruria, and the Aegean in the Eighth Century bc', in: J.-P. Descœudres (éd.), Greek Colonists and Native Populations. Proceedings of the First Australian Congress of Classical Archaeology, Sydney 1985 (1990) 78-82. 37 A display at the Museo Nazionale at Tarquinia shows a whole cabinet full of Euboean imitations which raises questions about the substantiation of the evidence for determining between imitation and import. 38 Yet, Euboean imitations can sometimes come very close to their models, and the line between true Corinthian and Etrusco-Corinthian is not always very clear, even to the most experienced. If one assumes with Neeft op. cit. (η. 8) 59, 367, that clay may have been shipped from Corinth to give locally-made vessels the look of imported products, the distinction could become almost impossible to make without having recourse to scientific clay analyses.

The date of these faience vessels makes a resolution even more difficult since they belong to the end of the 7th century, when it is evident that both Levantines and East Greeks were trading in faience amulets and scarabs. The issue is further clouded by the possibility, long ago raised by Coldstream, that there was Levantine settlement in the Dodecanese from an early date.47 While this was probably always on a very small scale, there would appear to be a significant amount of evidence suggesting that Rhodes served as a regional production centre for what are regarded as typically Levantine goods, including items in faience, scarabs, incised vessels, and anthropomorphic unguent vases.48 Nevertheless, in this database the attributions by Rathje and Hôlbl for Levantine faience are followed and those by Webb are used only when the vessels concerned have not been mentioned by either Rathje or Hôlbl. Related to this problem is the identification of Naucratis amulets and scarabs. There is some evidence to suggest that so-called Phoenician workshops were operating in Naucratis a little before, if not contemporaneously with, those designated as 'Greek'. The confusion between Levantine and Greek scarabs in the 6th century has resulted in a classification 'Greco-Phoenician', a term Boardman suggests should be discarded since 'there is in fact a spectrum of sources for the subjects, from Egyptian through Levantine to Greek, with plentiful overlaps', and he further points out that 'there is no good reason to suppose that those with Greek subjects were made in separate workshops, or by Greeks'.49 Boardman's study of Late Archaic and Classical Levantine scarabs implicitly acknowledges the close relationship in production and style of such material between East Greece and the Levant.50 Thus the identification of imported amulets and scarabs, particularly as concerns sources in the Levant and those in East Greece, offers huge scope for imprecision. Hôlbl is usually followed in this study, even to the point of accepting his belief that the quantities of scarabs to be found in and around Taranto in the 6th century should not be considered as indicative of Levantine trade.51 However, his word cannot be considered final on the subject, particularly as to this last point, which implies a judgement upon the identification of carriers—to be discussed below. The classification of material as 'Punic' can also be problematic. Boardman points out that the division between 'Phoenician' and 'Punic' has its advantages, but it can still be artificial under many circumstances.52 Does the use of 'Phoenician' indicate a Levantine source, while 'Punic' designates a western source? Or are these terms used to make distinctions in carriers, and if so, on what basis? One must assume that the former is usually the case in the minds of scholars, but some doubt can arise when the terms are not fully explained. The Levantine pottery from Populonia, for example, has often been described as 'Phoenician', even though ο W. Culican—who first pointed out its existence—quite clearly described it as 'Punic'. Here we may have differing use of the terms, or simply the illustration of the belief that 'Punic' material may be considered as Levantine in the sense that production at places such as Carthage should be thought of as 'Western Phoenician'. A resolution can only be achieved if we agree that material manufactured at Carthage should be called 'Punic', material from other Levantine colonies in the West be called 'Western Phoenician' or 'colonial Levantine', and that from the Levant as 'Levantine'. This is the method used in this study. 47 J. Ν. Coldstream, 'The Phoenicians of Ialysos', BICS 16, 1969, 1-8. 48 Ibid.; Markoe op cit. (η. 10) 171; Rathje art. cit. (η. 44) 98-9.

Bartoloni considers for instance some transport amphorae from Pithekoussai to have been produced in 'Phoenician' colonies in Sardinia (T.342, T.350, T.402, T.487, T.489, and T.523),54 while R. F. Docter and H. G. Niemeyer prefer to attribute the same vessels to Carthage, together with a number of the red-slipped plates and bowls also from Pithekoussai.55 There can be little doubt that Carthage was an important centre of pottery production by the 7th century at the latest.56 Other production centres in Levantine colonies in the West must also be considered likely. Proof is available from analyses of fabrics from excavated material at Carthage which show that pottery—Levantine in style—was imported from 'Western Phoenician' colonies in Spain.57 However, without detailed analysis little certainty is possible. The opinio communis is that it is notoriously difficult to ascertain the origin of pottery of Levantine manufacture or inspiration. Identifying even the region in which such pottery was produced can often be challenging. P. M. Bikai notes that Cypriot wares can be recognized in the mainland Levant, but that the reverse is not the case: deciding what is from the Levantine mainland and what is made locally in Cyprus is very difficult indeed and the distinction can often be noticed only by the rarity of certain forms.58 Very often a distinction is apparent between 'Phoenician' and 'Punic' simply upon the basis of the quality of the pottery. Ceramics from the German excavations at the Decumanus Maximus in Carthage indicate that imports from the Levant continued to arrive in the West in a fairly continuous flow from the 8th well into the 3rd century.59 This imported pottery is usually identified on the basis of quality. A good quality red slip, for example, is seen as indicative of production in mainland Levant.60 However, this ignores the evidence showing that good quality slip was also produced in the West. There are oinochoai from Motya which have a very good, deep red slip and that appear to be of local make,61 and some plates from Sardinia show a similar quality.62 Levantine fine-ware pottery can be difficult to recognize, and even the finer red-slip ware may be overlooked by excavators unfamiliar with its characteristics. The fabric contains inclusions typical of production both in the Levant and at 'western Phoenician' sites, with inclusions of both black and white, the latter usually being crushed shell.63 It can be fired to anything from a reddish-yellow to a paler yellow on the surface, with sometimes a slight greyish tinge inside. Levantine pottery is often burnished, both wheel-burnished and hand burnished. Slip, if used, does not always adhere well and there may be flaking. The colour of the slip, if used, can be from orange to brick-red tending towards a darker almost plum-red shade that may have its origins in attempts to emulate copper vessels.64 Levantine pottery 54 Referred to in R.

Birmingham for this réf.).</page><page sequence="14">14 Richard Fletcher can easily be mistaken for some of the common indigenous wares of Italy. This is particularly so in the case of the more common forms as opposed to shapes such as the mushroom-lipped oinochoai, and also when the pottery is without a slip or it has worn. The biscuit fabric of Levantine coarse-ware and transport amphorae is even more difficult to recognize for those unfamiliar with it.65 In summary, it must be acknowledged that while the origin of pottery in the Levantine style is often difficult to ascertain, it is not impossible. When care is taken it seems possible to identify colonial productions as opposed to imports.66 That Levantine pottery has been identified in Etruria and Campania, as well as Calabria, testifies to the expertise of those scholars responsible for its publication, but one suspects that there may be more to be found.67 As for 'Punic' material, for the purposes of the database, what has been so designated in publications is here treated as material of local production. Exceptions have been made in those cases where the term 'Punic' has been used in a way one might suspect indicates Levantine manufacture but carried by Carthaginians—unless it is specifically stated that such material was produced at Carthage or one of the Levantine colonies of the West.68 LOCAL OR INDIGENOUS PRODUCTION One of the problems with the study of imported material in Italy, particularly the Greek pottery, is the identification of the local production or imitation of Greek or Levantine material. The most obvious example is that of Ionian cups, long considered to be a marker of Greek trade, but now known to have also been produced at colonial sites. At Metaponto, F. D'Andria identified the local fabric and described it in 1975 in the preliminary report of the excavation in the Kerameikos area.69 The potter's quarter of the Achaean colony was continuously occupied by workshops from at least the mid-6th century to the end of the 4th century bc. Recent research suggests that most of the pottery found from the 6th century in 7 Π the chora of Metaponto was produced locally, and that very few pieces are imports. It is well understood that the most common of these, the B2 Ionian cup, was present in many different variants.71 It is apparent that such variations are a reflection of different workshops and artisans. Locally made 'fillet cups', named after the characteristic decoration of these vessels consisting of thin horizontal glazed lines on the rim, are also common. A chronological framework for this type of cup has been defined by the finds from the necropolis of Siris in Contrada Madonnelle at the end of the 7th century, probably from about the time of the foundation of Achaean Metaponto. The examples from the Madonnelle necropolis are 79 believed to have been produced in Siris. 65 Bikai loc. cit. 66 See, e.g., P. Bartoloni, Studi sulla ceramica fenicia e punica di Sardegna (1983); ead., Le anfore fenicie e puniche di Sardegna (1988); P. Bernardini, 'La Sardegna e i fenici. Appunti sulla colonizzazione', RStudFen 21, 1993, 29-81. 67 Supra n. 23. 68 An example is Culican's study of Levantine pottery at Populonia (art. cit. [η. 22]). Although he describes this pottery as 'Punic', the context of his argument makes it clear that he regarded the vessels found at Populonia as coming from the Phoenician homeland. 69 F.

Villard, 'Lampes du 7ème s. et chronologie des coupes ioniennes', MEFR 67, 1955, 14ff. In terms of typologies, it has been pointed out that the identification of locally produced types requires more focused studies. 72 One may also suspect a similar origin for those from Amendolara, though Sybaris is another possibility. These 'fillet cups' are among the best markers for that crucial historical moment in which the territory between the Bradano and Basento valleys was marked by several important transformations. By the second quarter of the 7th century, Greeks from Siris and indigenous populations had, in the immediate coastal hinterland around Metaponto, developed</page><page sequence="15">A Database of Imports in the Central Mediterranean 15 We are, therefore, fairly well informed on the subject of the production of Ionian and 'fillet' cups on the Ionian seaboard of peninsular Italy. Considering the volume of production at Metaponto, at least, one might go as far as to say that the vast majority of Ionian cups in colonial and native contexts in this part of southern Italy can be assumed to be of colonial manufacture.73 The production of similar pottery in Sicily, however, has not received due attention. It is difficult to believe that the colonies of the Ionian coast of peninsular Italy should have been producing such quantities of pottery, but that those of Sicily should have relied more heavily upon imports—at least for their fine wares. Local production is understood to have taken place in the Greek colonies of Sicily (as well as the widespread imitation of Greek wares in indigenous areas) and known to have taken place in quantity, but there appears to be an artificial separation between imports as quality products and locally-produced material as poorer reproductions of the originals. The extent of trade contacts between both colonial and indigenous Sicilian centres and Greece, Magna Graecia, and Etruria have been revealed by evidence from several sites in Sicily such as those of S. Cristoforo, Palermo, and Himera.74 But while at such sites Etruscan bucchero, Etrusco Corinthian, Greek, and colonially produced pottery has been found, the identification of material from Sicily produced at sites in Etruria, Magna Graecia, or Greece has not even been sought.75 So-called Samian lekythoi may serve to illustrate some of the points made above. Every vessel of this type is assumed, when found in context in the central Mediterranean, to be an import from East Greece. Yet, Culican long ago pointed out that this shape is quite 'foreign to Greek and Ionian ceramics', that the considerable variety in fabric as well as shape suggests that they were not distributed from one centre, and that no one can in fact demonstrate that these vessels were produced in East Greece.76 He suggested production sites in the Levant, in particular around Sidon, though A. M. Bisi thought that they might be Western Phoenician.77 a complex level of interaction, which is as yet not properly understood or defined. Around 630 bc, with the foundation of Metaponto, there would appear to be evidence for the violent cessation of these close interactive ties between Greeks and natives, replaced by a more aggressive pattern of Achaean colonial settlement. It is a common belief that this type of vessel is connected with both the settlement of Siris and the last phase of the expansion of Siris in the zone in which Metaponto was to be founded, at sites such as Incoronata and also propr.

There are, however, opposing views on this matter, most recently clarified by A. De Siena, Metaponto. Archeologia di una colonia greca (2001), and summarized by E. M. De Juliis, Metaponto (2001). 73 Personal experience in the Metapontino as well as in the Basilicata leads the author to believe that Ionian cups in this area are all locally produced. There was not a single imported Ionian cup among the material recovered in the survey of the chora of Metaponto by the University of Texas, and a large number of sherds of obvious Metaponto fabric have been found or seen by the author in the upper Bradano and Basento valleys. 74 C.

The author has seen unpublished material in Tarquinia that looks very similar to locally produced material from Himera, but which at Tarquinia is described as East Greek. Similarly, excavating at Francavilla Marittima, the author saw several pieces of Etrusco-Corinthian pottery. 76 W. Culican, 'Sidonian Bottles', Levant 7, 1975, 145-50. 77 A. M.

Culican loc. cit. points out, however, that very few have been found in Carthage.</page><page sequence="16">16 Richard Fletcher The uncertainty in this matter is another strong indication of the close connection between Levantine and East Greek manufacturing, a point explicitly made by Culican.78 There is another possibility, which is that at least some of these vessels were produced in the west at Greek colonial sites. This suggestion is the result of the author's own study of some of these vessels in Sicily (in particular at Agrigento, Himera, and Gela) and at Sybaris, where the fabric of some specimens resembles the fabric of locally produced wares.79 The database presented in this paper cannot take into account all the problems of identification and chronology described above, but one should be reminded that a catalogue of this kind will be made up of what amounts to a collection of uncertainties. The practice has been to enter the data as they have been published, except in those rare cases where the author is certain that the publication contains errors, and to interpret the results on that basis— keeping the problems just mentioned in mind. PATTERNS OF DISTRIBUTION The method used to display the patterns of distribution may require some explanation. The maps used are generated within a GIS package Maplnfo 5.5. They generally take two forms: pie-graphs of various classifications of material arranged by site (pl. I: 7) and so-called 'Grid Maps' which display data as continuous colour gradations across the map (pl. I: 1). The latter is produced by an interpolation of data from each site. Maplnfo takes data from the database by site and passes those centroids and their data values to an interpolator. The interpolation method is Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), which uses a distance weighted average of data points to calculate grid cell values (given colours) over the entire surface of the map. For the colour gradation distribution map the interpolator uses an exponent of 2 and a search radius of 1000 km. COMPARABLE MATERIAL One of the most pressing questions about the database is how it deals with comparisons between classifications of imported material (e.g. pottery vs. amulets). This problem is often overlooked in quantitative approaches to exchange in archaeology, where it is usually assumed that classifications are comparable or that classifications are defined in such a way that inconsistencies can be glossed over, and little explanation is given as to why this should be the case.80 At base, the problem lies with concepts of value. It is assumed that one cannot compare pottery distributions with those of silver vessels, or scarabs with amphorae, because of the relative value of the objects. This may, of course, be true, but one should be wary of assigning value to commodities in a period in which we have little evidence to support our assumptions in the matter. We learn from literary evidence from the period that there appears to have been significant differences in value between some of the aforementioned classifications of material,81 but value in Greece or the Levant says little about value in the central Mediterranean. The most quoted example of this is the famous story recorded by Diodorus Siculus (V 26: 2-3) of the incredulous Greeks who found Celts willing to accept as little as one amphora of wine for a slave. There is also the point that what was perceived as valuable cargo was not necessarily the most profitable cargo.82 Some classification of material in terms 78 Culican art. cit. 155. 79 This can only be a suggestion at this stage since it would require a proper detailed study to explore the idea further. 80 For an example of how the problem may be glossed over, see R. Tomber, 'Quantitative approaches to the investigation of long-distance exchange', JRA 6, 1993, 142-66. 81 Well set out by Winter art. cit. (η. 10) 249-52. 82 J.

The fundamental point of the database is not about deciphering questions of value. The objects in the catalogue may be used in a variety of ways; they might be used to ask questions about the consumption and deposition of various classifications of objects, valuable or otherwise. The database allows for classes of material to be studied separately, but it also allows the material to be studied as a whole. The objects can be taken alone simply as indicators of trade and exchange, and this may be done by assuming that the objects contained within the database were not the primary material of trade and exchange in the Early Iron Age and Archaic period. The basis for this assumption must be that the little literary and direct archaeological evidence we have (i.e. shipwrecks) suggests that most cargoes consisted of what we would now call primary produce.83 Although some scholars have argued that long distance trade was initiated in the 8th century by aristocrats serving a demand for 'luxury' goods, and doing so in terms of gift-exchange—thus positioning imports in the central Mediterranean as items carried for their own sake—there is in fact little evidence to support this.84 Certainly by the 7th century long-distance trade dealt in a wide variety of goods—and in bulk goods—and recent finds from the Levant have shown vessels trading mainly in wine even in the 8th century.85 An explanation for the presence of the surviving items may therefore be that they were in some way 'parasitic' on the large-scale movements of other goods. Thus the presence of scarabs, amulets, metal vessels, ornaments, pottery, and so on can be seen as indicators of the trade in other goods or as the containers for other products, such as wine, oil, perfume, or foodstuffs.86 Thus it is not necessary to make separations between classifications and restrict the scope of the study: a scarab is indicative of a connection, direct or indirect, with an external trader in the same way as is a silver vessel or a sherd of Corinthian pottery. CARRIERS AND THEIR ETHNIC IDENTITY The carriers of Early Iron Age trade in the Mediterranean are usually identified as Greeks, Cypriots, and Phoenicians.87 This is as far as most would wish to go, since most would agree that pots cannot be equated with people and that the question of who carried what goods in the Early Iron Age is impossible to answer.88 The problem is compounded by our inability to define ethnically the aforementioned groups.89 The question concerning the ethnic identity of ancient peoples is fraught with difficulties of perception and definition as well as historiographical traditions and reactions, as 83 Supra η. 10, also J.

Hall has demonstrated.90 The term 'Phoenician', for instance, is still ill-defined and loosely used on the basis of texts that offer only a classical point of view. There is no evidence that the inhabitants of the cities of the Levantine coast such as Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, and Arwad, which are likely to have been 'fiercely independent, rival cities',91 constituted an ethnic unit. Similarly, to assign a term 'Greek' to the various peoples from the Aegean involved in trade in the Early Iron Age may well be to speak out of chronological context. We are thus faced with a dilemma regarding the use of ethnic labelling in the archaeological record. It should be clear that there can be no linkage established between material assemblages and ethnic identity, though there is an argument for ethnicity being expressed through mortuary practices.92 But the point here is that labels can continue to be used if there is no question of using the evidence to identify an assemblage with an ethnic unit and if some trouble is taken to strictly define the terms. Thus a pot thought to have been made at Corinth may be called 'Corinthian' or even 'Greek' as a convenience, but without making any assumptions about the existence of either a Corinthian or Greek ethnicity. Similarly, material that is thought to have been produced and exported from the Levant will be called 'Levantine', whilst 'Phoenician' is used to describe material from Sidon, Tyre, Cyprus, Syria, ni Egypt, or anywhere on the eastern Mediterranean littoral. An attempt has been made to substitute ethnic with geographical terms: 'Levantine' is used to describe the origin of artefacts from the Mediterranean eastern littoral, 'Greek' for material from the area of modem Greece and the Aegean. More specific terms are used only when a specific ethnic identity (or a language in the case of Aramaean) can be supported. Returning to the question of carriers, one might, on the basis of some patterns of evidence, make some tentative suggestions for the early periods. As will be demonstrated in detail below, amongst Greek Geometric pottery, Euboean pottery is predominant in Tyrrhenian Italy before 725 bc (63 Euboean pieces, 19 Corinthian, 6 Attic and Cycladic). It seems implausible that traders from other areas of Greece were carrying the Euboean pottery at this early period, especially given the demonstrated contacts between Euboea and the Tyrrhenian, including immigrant Eretrian potters at Veii,94 and the Etruscan adoption of the Euboean alphabet.95 No other area of Greece provides such quantity and quality of evidence for contact at this early period. On the other hand, since Levantine material is also spread around the Mediterranean at this early period (with plenty both on Euboea and in the Tyrrhenian), there is no way of ruling out the transport of Euboean pottery in Levantine ships. The site of Pithekoussai is a useful example of the complexities of the question of carriers because it gives us not only evidence of the importation of material, but also evidence (in terms of burial practices) for the settlement of people from the Aegean and the Levant at the same site.96 Despite evidence that Pithekoussai had a significant number of settlers of Euboean origin (alphabet, burial customs, metrology, and the Euboeanizing local pottery 90 Ethnie Identity in Greek Antiquity (1997) 1. 91 Markoe op. cit. (η. 10) 10. 92 Hall op cit. 128-30. 93 There remain considerable drawbacks with this approach, since the labelling of a scarab as 'Levantine' opens one of those chains of signifiers that can introduce problems of their own. A scarab may have been made in Egypt (for example, Naucratis) by a person from an East Greek city; it may then have been carried by a person from Sidon to a site in Sicily. It could also have been made in Tyre and carried by a person from Euboea. This scarab will be labelled 'Levantine' even though a 'Greek' may have been involved in the manufacture and/or shipping of the item. 94 J.-P. Descœudres in: Descœudres-R.

One might think that Euboeans were trading in the Corinthian material, for three reasons: 1. The strong Euboean element in the local pottery; 2. The Euboean LG material features the prevalence of a strong Corinthianizing element; 3. Euboean trade at this early date is widely believed to have operated out of the Corinthian Gulf and the Ionian Sea.97 The first of these points does not preclude carriers other than people from Euboea. It may raise the probability that large numbers of Greek pots were brought west by Euboeans and would be supported, one would think, by the predominance of Euboean material on mainland Italy, but one should not be too quick to dismiss the possibility that Corinthian traders—or Levantine traders for that matter—may have been operating in the Tyrrhenian from an early date. This leads us to the second and third points since there is ample evidence for some very early Corinthian activity in the Ionian Sea. The initial motivation for Corinthian trade up the gulf towards Epirus may have had something to do with both perfume and metals, particularly copper and tin, commodities rare in the Aegean.98 One way or the other, Corinthian trade in the Ionian Sea included southern Puglia, where the considerable quantities of early Corinthian material at Otranto (in addition to Vaste and Cavallino), dated, perhaps, as early as MG I, suggest that Corinthian trade in the area was well established.99 We really can have no certainty as to who was carrying this early Corinthian material in the Tyrrhenian, but the proposition that Euboeans were working through the Corinthian Gulf and carrying Corinthian pottery is unconvincing,100 especially in view of the relative scarcity of Euboean material in Salento. If one considers the conditions for sailing in the region, Euboean traders—who may have had to sail around the Peloponnese, as C. Morgan contends101—once in the Ionian Sea, would have found it far easier to sail west to the Tyrrhenian than up against the prevailing northerlies and north-westerlies towards Epirus.102 Thus the evidence for Corinthian connections with Euboean trade could be interpreted as indicating Corinthian activity, not just Euboean activity: some of the earliest Euboean pots in the West are associated with small amounts of Corinthian material and there are a few Late Geometric Euboean pots in Corinth.103 The tradition of Euboean settlement on Kerkyra must, however, be considered against such an idea, and this remains clear and unequivocal literary information that simply cannot be dismissed. We can sometimes make tentative suggestions based on negative evidence. Given the early and intense presence of Corinthian pottery in Salento, the proximity of Corinth to Salento, and the very small quantities of Euboean pottery, that Corinthian traders were responsible for the movement of most goods in this area seems plausible. The complete absence of early Levantine material in Puglia, on the other hand, renders the suggestion that Phoenicians 97 J. Ν.

An example may be the Wedjat-eye amulets. Less than 20 of these have been found in the Aegean, and not a single example in peninsular Italy, yet these are numerous in Levantine sites. Surely, therefore, one may reasonably suggest that these amulets were carried by Levantines. After 700 bc, there is no reasonable way to distinguish the ethnicity of carriers for the most part; patterns become far more complex and the sheer quantity of material must make identification more difficult. Later literary and archaeological evidence for the existence, at least by the 6th century, of maritime traders (such as the Aeginetans who were major carriers, but who carried practically nothing of their own) counsels extreme caution on this question, as do the cargoes of Archaic shipwrecks.105 PRELIMINARY RESULTS The catalogue upon which this study is based has been compiled in order to give a general picture of trade in Early Iron Age and Archaic Italy. Although it contains a total of 37,874 individual artefacts in 14,746 database entries, these are not only spread over a three century period, but are probably only a very small number of what has been found. To give an example, at Megara Hyblaea there were just under 15,000 pieces of Corinthian pottery, which were only a half of the total number of finds from the foundation of the colony.106 At the risk of repeating the point made earlier, there are undoubtedly large numbers of imported wares that have not been published and no doubt much that has been missed. The catalogue is therefore no more than a first sketch. LEVANTINE MATERIAL (pl. 1:1) A look at the numbers will draw attention to some of the problems already mentioned. Of the 2,682 artefacts thought to have origins in the Levant, only 237 have been identified in publication as having a source in 'Phoenicia' or the Near East. Another 401 have a source in Egypt with a further 129 said to be from Naucratis. All the others (i.e. more than two-thirds of the total) are of 'unknown origin'. Many of these would have been of Levantine manufacture, but there have also been claims for manufacturing sites in East Greece or even in Magna Graecia.107 The largest contingent of artefacts (1,197 or about 45%) are amulets of various kinds, including Sekhmet, Nefertem, Bes, and Pataikos figurines often arranged in what were probably necklaces. The next most common are scarabs and scaraboids, with 1,173 entries (about 44%). There are 112 (4%) perfume vessels of numerous types. Of the more conspicuous artefacts, much discussed by scholars, there are only 34 bowls, cauldrons, and jugs (1.3%), usually bronze or silver, and only 25 ostrich eggs (less than 1%). Surprisingly, there are only 85 ceramic vessels (3.2%) of various kinds, usually amphorae. These are surprising results 104 S. P. Morris-J.

As for the chronology of the Levantine material, the earliest artefact is described as a scarab of light blue paste in the Villa Giulia, in Rome from Grotta Gramiccia tomb 183 at Veii, apparently dating to the beginning of the 8th century.108 Thereafter, in the second quarter of the 8th century, there are scarabs from Veii and Torre Galli (in Calabria), as well as a Mut figurine from Cumae. From the middle of the century onwards material becomes more numerous and more widespread. The earliest metal vessel is from Francavilla, followed soon after by Vetulonia, though it is not until about 700 bc that we find other vessels turning up in southern Etruria and Campania. There are some difficulties about the last of the Levantine imports, mainly concerning their date. It is fairly clear from the catalogue that the number of Levantine imports to peninsular Italy dropped off in the second half of the 7th century, but concomitant with this was an increase in East Greek material and, in the last quarter of the 7th century, colonial material often copying the styles of the Levantine. Deciding what is Levantine and what East Greek or Greek colonial in this period is very difficult.109 Since there is only one object in peninsular Italy known to have been manufactured in the Levant after 600 bc, it was therefore decided not to attempt to separate this material from its imitators after 600 bc and to consider Levantine material (on the peninsula) as insignificant after that date.110 AEGEAN MATERIAL Euboean/Cycladic (pl. I: 2) The total number of artefacts included in the catalogue as 'Euboean' or 'Cycladic' comes to a total of just 173. The difficulty lies above all in the fact that 'Euboean' pottery, as far as we know, tends to imitate other wares, especially Attic, Corinthian, Cycladic, and Boeotian, in fabric as well as with regards to shapes and decoration. In Italy one faces the additional difficulty of local (Italic) imitations.111 Our second problem is our limited knowledge of the ware: Lefkandi and Eretria are the main sources of information, to which one might add a number of wells and tombs in Chalcis. These suggest that Chalcidian was quite different from Lefkandian/Eretrian. Thus 'Euboean' may well be a misnomer in the same way that 'Cycladic' actually covers numerous wares. The objects that have been found are mostly drinking vessels—skyphoi, cups, and a kantharos. These account for 92 of the total of 173 Euboean objects (53%). There are a total of 8 kraters, 9 oinochoai, and 17 aryballoi. The latter have been found at Pithekoussai and one at Capua, while at Pontecagnano some brocca have been found—an interesting shape that would not appear to have been Greek.112 There are numerous Euboean pieces that have not been described in detail, such as those at Otranto.113 There are more than 50 of these in the database. Euboean material is spread over a period ranging from 770 to about 690 bc. The earliest material seems to be from Pontecagnano and Veii, with Capua and Cumae also in the running. 108 Hôlbl op. cit. no. 36: scarab of light-blue paste, Rome, Villa Giulia inv. gen. 33.453. 109 See discussion above. 110 The material in the catalogue after 600 bc centres mainly upon Taranto, where the pieces from the middle of the 6th century were almost certainly not imported by Levantines: Hôlbl op. cit 130-1. 111 See Descceudres art. cit.

Descœudres, 'The Chiusa at the Masseria del Fano in Salento', Meditarch 9/10, 1996/7, 230-1 fig. 35.</page><page sequence="22">22 Richard Fletcher The dating of early Euboean skyphoi remains somewhat open. Although some scholars would date these 'precolonial' skyphoi closer to 800 than to 750 bc,114 Descoeudres and Kearsley place them after 750 bc.115 At Pontecagnano there are several skyphoi from the period 780 750 bc, many of which would certainly date closer to 780 than 750 bc. At Veii, most early Euboean skyphoi have been found in tombs belonging to Phase IIA,116 dated by Descoeudres to 780-730 bc.117 At Capua and Cumae there are also early Euboean skyphoi, perhaps earlier than the foundation of Pithekoussai, dated almost unanimously to around 770 bc.118 By the middle of the century, Euboean material has turned up in Etruria, Campania, and southern Puglia and is at its greatest extent and in greatest numbers in the years 750-700 bc, particularly the third quarter of the century. It would appear from the material in the catalogue that after 690 bc or, let us say, the end of Early Protocorinthian, Euboean material is no longer being imported into Italy. This is usually explained by the Lelantine war and its 'debilitating' effects on Euboean trade, a suggestion proposed by Coldstream among others.119 Corinthian (pl. 1:3) Some difficulties with Corinthian material relate to imitations made locally. Such imitations are usually identifiable on the basis of fabric alone, since Corinthian fabric is perhaps the easiest to recognize.120 However, the identification of the so-called 'Pithecussan workshops' by C. W. Neeft illustrates how close some colonial imitations could come, particularly when one assumes with Neeft and G. Buchner that Corinthian clay may have been imported to Pithekoussai for the purpose of coating the aryballoi in question.121 In terms of shape, the main contributors to the total of 24,439 Corinthian objects are the drinking vessels. These account for 14,200 or about 58%, of the total. They include skyphoi, kotylai, Thapsos cups, kantharoi, kyathoi, kylikes, and those simply described as 'cups'. The most numerous are kotylai, with 9,801 of the total. As one might expect, the next most common shapes are perfume vessels—most often the aryballos—of which there are 5,179 in the catalogue, or 21.2%. Oinochoai and olpai are also numerous with a total of 2,131 (8.7%), and pyxides number 915 (about 3.7%) and kraters 420 (less than 2%). Corinthian transport amphorae are also relatively numerous, 536 being found, accounting for 2.2%. Chronologically, Corinthian material in the Italian peninsula covers the whole period of this investigation. It first appears at Otranto in Salento with Middle Geometric I skyphoi and oinochoai, dating to just before 800 bc. The most important period seems to be the 7th century, with Corinthian in the third quarter of that century showing a particular dominance throughout the peninsula. The last of the Corinthian, at least in this catalogue, is found in Salento and Sicily at the end of the 6th century.122 East Greek (pl. I: 4) There are numerous difficulties with what has here been labelled 'East Greek', essentially anything said to be from the west coast of Turkey with Rhodes and Cos in the south, and including Samos, Chios, Miletus as well as the marbled ware that may be from Lydia. Not least of the problems with 'East Greek' ware is identifying the origin of objects, but their 114 E.g., Coldstream art. cit. (η. 36). 115 Descœudres-Kearsley art. cit.

So-called 'Ionic bucchero', for example, can only be dated to 620-550 bc—few are able with any confidence to give firmer dates.123 Many perfume vessels, of faience or clay, are given dates to half-century periods.124 Wares from Chios are 1 r\c known only a little better. Even for Ionian cups, the generally accepted chronology of Vallet and Villard, though keeping generally to 25-year periods, dates the A2 type to 625 575 bc.126 The shapes encountered are quite varied. The most common are the various types of drinking vessels, particularly the so-called 'Ionian cups' with 2,481 examples or about 60% of the total of 4,109 East Greek artefacts in the catalogue. Next most common are perfume vessels and balsamaria with 749 items or 18.2%. Of these perfume vessels, there are 118 KW {Kreis- und Wellenband) aryballoi, mainly from Campania,127 107 Ionic bucchero vessels, 27 'Samian' lekythoi, 59 Lydia, as well as faience vessels and other aryballoi and alabastra. Of the variously named transport amphorae, there are 386, of which 62 come from Chios and 37 from Samos. Also significant are 71 amphorae (1.7%), 75 oinochoai and 31 bronze oinochoai (2.6%), 133 plates (3.2%), and some 26 kraters (less than 1%). There may be some difficulties with chronology, but we are still able to get a fair idea of the changes in East Greek trade. The earliest material dates from near the end of the 8th century, with Kreis- und Wellenband aryballoi in Rome just before the end of the century, and numerous examples from about 700 at Pithekoussai, and several from Etruria and Cumae. Numbers are steady, though low, throughout the first three quarters of the 7th century, leading to an increase in the last quarter, based mainly upon Sicily and Etruria. It is in the first quarter of the 6th century that we see a veritable explosion of East Greek material into Sicily, the Ionian seaboard, and Etruria, and spreading to the rest of the peninsula in the second quarter. This wide distribution slows in the third quarter and is limited to Sicily, Salento, and Gravisca in the last quarter. Laconian (pl. I: 5) There are few difficulties with Laconian pottery, thanks to recent studies by C. M. Stibbe and P. Pelagatti.128 Of the total of 1,059 Laconian pieces, the majority, unlike other styles from other sources, are kraters. These amount to 426 pieces, or 40%, including volute and what Stibbe calls 'pseudo-volute' kraters, bell and calyx kraters, and stirrup kraters. Of the rest, 215 (20%) of the total are perfume vessels, and 211 (another 20%) are drinking vessels.

It is not until 600 bc, however, that we begin to find Laconian expanding its distribution, and in the first quarter of the century numbers slowly increase. In the second quarter of the 6th century, Laconian seemingly reaches the height of its popularity with a large number found in the widest distribution. In the third quarter, numbers and distribution contract somewhat, and in the last quarter there are only relatively small numbers confined to Sicily and Puglia. Attic (pl. I: 6) The results concerning the Attic material are perhaps the least reliable at this stage of the study, simply because there is still Attic material in Sicily and Sardinia to be included in the database. There are few difficulties with Attic pottery since it is the most studied of all the styles of Greece; its chronology is well understood, and its fabric and style have been relatively easy to recognize for some time. The only major difficulty that has been encountered concerns Attic pottery from the 6th century stemming from non-scientific excavations which is today kept in various collections and museums. For much of it provenances are unknown, and there is no information about contexts, though most pieces are likely to have been found in tombs. The shapes encountered show a similar pattern to that of other styles. Of the total of 5,018 Attic pieces, 2,291 (about 46%) are cups of one kind or other. The next most popular shape is the amphora, of which there are 42 Panathenaic amphorae, 570 neck-amphorae, and 531 other types, giving a total of 1,143 or about 23% of the total. Some shapes are surprisingly rare: only 401 kraters (8%), just 252 hydriai (5%), and a mere 125 (2.5%) of the various types of pouring vessels (oinochoai or olpai). Attic transport amphorae are reasonably well represented with 386 examples. Black-figure vases are the most numerous with 3,776 examples or about 75%, while only 984 examples (about 20% of the total) are decorated in red-figure technique. Attic material turns up quite early in Italy, with some vessels at Veii going back to about 730 bc,129 and at Fani in Salento possibly a little earlier.130 There is also an early example at Canale in Calabria, an oinochoe, dated to about 710 bc. Starting at the very end of the 8th century there are a number of Attic SOS amphorae with a fairly wide distribution. However, Attic material generally remains fairly sparse until about 590 bc when it begins its rise to dominate the market of imported ceramics in Italy. It is in the last half of the 6th century that this dominance becomes apparent, seen largely as the result of better quality Attic wares, though this is far from undisputed.131 One way or the other, in the second quarter, Attic material begins to outnumber East Greek all over the Italian peninsula and by the last quarter of the 6th century it makes up the vast majority of all imports. The distribution of Attic material is consistently fairly wide. Early on there is a tendency for Attic to resemble the Euboean distribution. The only early site with Attic that does not also have Euboean is Canale, but at that site there is a distinctly Euboean stylistic influence in local production.132 After 700 bc, when Euboean imports begin to disappear, Attic imports seem to be restricted to transport amphorae. However, they still have a wide distribution with examples in the first quarter of the 7th century at Incoronata, Cumae, and Leuca, and in the second quarter at Cerveteri. In the third quarter, the distribution of transport amphorae is restricted to Etruria, with relatively large numbers turning up: at Cerveteri there are 20 examples, at Vulci 129 In Descœudres-Kearsley art. cit.

At Policoro in Basilicata there are 9 examples, but the dating is too difficult to determine. When Attic figured pottery starts to make an appearance in Italy, it does so first in Etruria, with an amphora in Cerveteri in about 610 BC, then at a number of sites in Etruria in varied shapes from about 590 bc. By the end of the first quarter of the 6th century, on the other hand, it has turned up in Puglia, at Locri in Calabria, in Campania, and a number of sites in Etruria. By 550 bc it is found at almost all sites, though not always outnumbering other wares—a feat it achieves by about 525 bc. Other Areas There are some other pieces from other sources to consider, though their number is quite small. To begin with, at Pithekoussai there are a number of Argive jugs and monochrome lekythoi dating to around 700 bc. Argive and Achaean material is present at a number of other sites in the 7th century. There are also a number of objects, such as 'Greek Bronze Oinochoai', that are thought to be Greek but which have no known source.133 There are also two Boeotian jars from Tarquinia dated summarily to the 7th century.134 SOME INDICATIONS BY SHAPE, SOURCE, AND DESTINATION (pis. I: 7-IV: 3) Below are shown some preliminary distribution maps in overlapping 50-year sections, made in a Maplnfo GIS, from the database catalogue. These should be used in conjunction with the figures already shown. It should be noted that the maps below only include those pieces dated to within the 50-year periods shown (although the first is a 100-year period); there are considerably more not included because the date range for them extends to a century or more. It is not within the scope of this paper to attempt a thorough analysis of the distribution patterns produced by the database. Since brevity is required and the database remains incomplete, only some preliminary points may be made. The distribution of Levantine artefacts shows some fairly clear patterns. In the 8th century, Levantine material appears in Calabria, Campania, and Etruria, with the larger number turning up in Campania and Etruria (pis. I: 7—II: 3). There are considerable quantities also in Sicily and Sardinia; however, these are usually not dated to periods which enable display in the system used above (pl. I: 1). The largest numbers of Levantine objects appear to have been deposited in the century 750-650 BC, with an apparent emphasis in the quarter-century 725 700 bc in Campania and in 700-675 bc in Etruria. There would appear a greater distribution in Etruria of many types of artefacts, but ostrich eggs are perhaps the most widespread. The most strikingly apparent result, however, is that no Levantine material whatsoever has been found in Salento or the entire region of Puglia, nor is there any significant quantity along the Adriatic coast. There is some early material in Calabria and Basilicata, but after 700 bc Italy south of Campania sees nothing in the way of Levantine artefacts. This would clearly give the lie to the proposition that Levantines were operating out of the Corinthian Gulf or directing 1 Λ/Τ Corinthian trade in pottery. Also apparent from the distributions is that there is not a focus of material upon northern Etruria. Levantine material would appear to have a mainly Tyrrhenian distribution that ends up with a focus on southern rather than northern Etruria, on Sardinia and western Sicily (pl. I: 3). In no way can the patterns of distribution support the claim that 'Phoenicians ... were exploiting the silver resources of northern Etruria',137 even if one were to ignore distributions of pottery, amulets, and scarabs. 133 T.

It is also present, but more modestly, in Sardinia and Salento (pl. I: 2). This might appear to fit in well with B. d'Agostino's suggestion for two circuits of Greek trade in the early 8th century with Corinthian trade along the Gulf of Corinth including Salento as part of a 'closed' circuit limited to the Greek world, and a trade in Euboean material operating a Tyrrhenian circuit 'open' in the sense that it was not limited to predetermined destinations.138 Such an argument, however, appears to be predicated upon an assumption that this material was carried by Corinthians or Euboeans. Thus, it has been suggested that Euboeans may have been using a route down the Corinthian Gulf, presumably crossing the isthmus at Corinth or using a trans-Boeotian route. But even if we were to accept the possibility that Euboean material was exclusively carried by Euboeans, Catherine Morgan has shown that there is no real evidence to support the proposition.139 The Euboean material in Salento may indeed be part of Corinthian activity in the area, or a Euboean stop-off on the way to the West, but we are dealing with such small numbers of artefacts that it is not really possible to do more than speculate. The distribution of Corinthian wares changes little with time, except that it expands, after the beginnings in Salento, into a wider distribution including southern Italy and Sicily. Apart from Salento, the earlier Corinthian material has been found at Metaponto and Incoronata, and on the Tyrrhenian side of the peninsula at Pontecagnano, Pithekoussai, and Veii. By the last quarter of the 8th century, however, Corinthian objects begin to show a very wide distribution throughout the south in Puglia, Basilicata, and Calabria, as well as Campania, Etruria, and Sicily. We should keep in mind that Corinthian colonization in Sicily started with the foundation of Syracuse just before this date (the mid-730s bc),140 and this fact along with the increased distribution of the last quarter of the 8th century clearly indicates a widening of the Corinthian circuit that was previously based upon the Gulf of Corinth, Salento, and the Adriatic. The wide distribution of the late 8th century continues through the 7th century. It is worth noting, however, that Sardinia never features very strongly in this distribution (pl. I: 3), and while Etruria has always shown a proportion of the total, there is little in northern Etruria except for the coastal area, and there always seems to be a greater emphasis upon Campania and the south. For example, at this stage of the study, there are just 385 examples of Corinthian material from central Italy, or 1.6% of the total, and the almost insignificant number of 18 in Sardinia. Even if one does not count material from Sicily, central Italy only accounts for 6.8% of the total of Corinthian material. This may be further illustrated by the diminishing Corinthian distribution in the 6th century (pis. Ill: 4-IV: 2), in which Etruria saw far less material in proportion to the south. By the second half of the 6th century, Corinthian is mainly limited to Salento and Sicily and seems to consist mainly of transport vessels and some drinking vessels. It may be of some significance, however, that perfume vessels were never very numerous in Puglia. If one discounts Taranto, there are only 34 examples from Puglia (less than 1% of the total, and 3.6% of the number from peninsular Italy). The continued Corinthian emphasis on Salento throughout the three centuries of this study lends some credence to the theory of a circuit of trade in Corinthian material based in the Corinthian gulf and moving north and west therefrom,141 and even in the 5th century, Corinthian policy seems 138 Β.

The changes in distribution of East Greek material over time are quite interesting. The early material, indeed the material right up until the last quarter of the 7th century, has a distribution limited to Tyrrhenian Italy. It is interesting that few of these early artefacts find their way into Campania, despite their fairly consistent presence at Pithekoussai. There are some aryballoi found at Cumae and a few examples of East Greek material in the 6th century, but the numbers are always very small. East Greek material, however, would always seem to have been present in Etruria from about 700 bc onwards (pis. II: 4-IV: 2). On the face of it, this suggests what many have long suspected: that Pithekoussai was a staging post for trade with Etruria.143 But this may not necessarily be the case since the apparent emphasis on Etruria was present throughout the history of East Greek trade with the area. Indeed, a comparison of material from East Greece (pl. IV: 3) and of the Levant (pl. IV: 4) shows some startling similarities. The distribution of East Greek material reaches its widest distribution in the second quarter of the 6th century, although it is clearly dominant in Etruria in the first quarter (pl. Ill: 3-4). After about 550 bc, the distribution becomes more limited and the numbers smaller. The distribution of Laconian pottery displays some interesting patterns. The early distribution, as has already been mentioned, is limited to Taranto (pl. II: 2). In the last quarter of the 7th century, however, it turns up quite suddenly in Etruria and Sicily (pl. Ill: 2-3). This situation continues in the first quarter of the 6th century, though there is a wider distribution in Puglia (seemingly from Taranto). There are also some pieces found in Calabria, which are probably closely linked to the wide Laconian distribution in Sicily,144 but otherwise Laconian seems to be concentrated in Etruria, Puglia, and Sicily. In Etruria, Cerveteri and Gravisca seem particularly important, with Cerveteri absorbing almost a third of the krater production.145 The widest distribution is in the second quarter of the 6th century. Campania and Sardinia also see numbers of Laconian pieces, but it is Sicily and the Ionian seaboard that always seem to have featured strongly in the trade in this material (pl. I: 5), and which continue to import Laconian until the end of the 6th century. Looking at the distribution of Attic pottery, one might be inclined to think that the early distribution follows a circuit of trade in Euboean material and the later that of East Greek.146 But this is not sustainable if one looks carefully at the evidence. Simply put, Attic material seems to be part of all circuits, but at different times. It may appear to be part of an Euboean circuit until 700 bc, but it would seem that the distribution of transport amphorae indicates another circuit of trade. Similarly, looking at the distribution of Attic on the Tyrrhenian coast and Etruria, an East Greek circuit is possible, but there are examples in southern Italy and Campania (particularly in the first quarter of the 6th century) where there are Attic pots but none that could be East Greek. It would seem that the wide distribution of Attic requires something more than simplistic solutions such as an East Greek carrying trade.147 There are a number of very interesting points that can be made using the evidence from the database in relation to distribution centres. There are several sites which appear important as 142 One of the main reasons for the crisis that lead to the Peloponnesian War according to D. Kagan, On the Origins of War (1996) 36-7. 143 Ridgway op. cit. (η. 12) 107-9; J. P. Crielaard, 'How the West Was Won: Euboeans vs. Phoenicians', in: Niemeyer Rolle (eds.) op. cit.

(η. 105) 51-3. 147 Johnston ibid, certainly makes this clear.</page><page sequence="28">28 Richard Fletcher possible distribution centres for imports. Pithekoussai cornes to mind, as do Taranto, Sybaris, Tharros, Syracuse (and several other Sicilian sites) as well as Veii, Cerveteri, Tarquinia, and Vulci. For example, Pithekoussai has a total of 698 Greek and 171 Levantine artefacts. A look at the distribution maps for the years 750-600 bc (pis. II: 2—III: 2) shows that it was always a site of some importance, with the interesting exception of the first quarter of the 7th century— a possible confirmation of the volcanic activity leading to an exodus from the island around this time.148 In addition, there may be evidence for the site being used as a distribution centre in the trade of East Greek material in Etruria, though the patterns would suggest it had more use for Campania than for Etruria. Similarly, Veii's seeming importance in the 8th century might be illustrated by this catalogue. Although there are only 31 Greek and 67 Levantine artefacts—all but 16 from the 8th century—among sites in Etruria, Veii has by far the greatest number of imports in this period. Only Tarquinia comes close with 8 Greek and 18 Levantine artefacts from the 8th century. Veii appears as a site where early traders may have found a market for Euboean and Levantine goods and which may have been of some regional importance. It is interesting that after 700 bc there would appear to have been a lacuna in imports to Veii until a full generation later, when Corinthian pieces start appearing around 670 bc. This is despite the fact that Corinthian wares start to appear in numbers in Tarquinia and Castel di Decima in the last quarter of the 8th century. It would seem that Veii either retained some loyalty to their first foreign traders or that traders in Corinthian wares no longer found Veii a site of importance. After 700 bc, Veii seems to have lost its position in the import trade to Cerveteri and Tarquinia; a look at the distribution maps for 700-600 bc (pis. II: 4 III: 2) shows both these sites dominating the Etrurian market. Tarquinia begins with higher concentrations of imports, but Cerveteri eventually overshadows its neighbour. Eventually, in the 6th century, both sites are overshadowed by Vulci. In the 6th century, Tarquinia and Cerveteri show 170 and 341 artefacts respectively, while Vulci returns 1,078.149 Some points may be made on overall patterns relating to shape. A glance at the table below shows that there is an emphasis upon drinking vessels in imports to the region. This emphasis immediately brings to mind Greek trade in the East and systems of gift-exchange; exploring evidence from Cyprus, both Coldstream and Crielaard have explained similar patterns in such terms.150 There are, however, other explanations that may be examined.

Categories. Firstly, there is the possibility that a large number of cups in proportion to oinochoai and kraters were simply the norm. If we look at proportions of drinking vessels to kraters and oinochoai in Cyprus there are some similar results (Table 2). The proportions of drinking vessels to pouring vessels in this catalogue are 7:1, while the proportions of drinking vessels to kraters are about 15:1. In J. P. Crielaard's study of Early Iron Age Greek pottery in Cyprus from about 950 to the early 7th century he found, on the basis of 170 vessels, the proportions 148 Ridgway op. cit. (η. 12) 35-7. 149 Much may well be said for other sites along these lines, but this is not the place to describe the patterns of trade for each region in Italy. 150 J. N. Coldstream, 'Kition and Amathus: Some Reflections on their Westward Links during the Early Iron Age', in: V. Karageorghis (ed.), Acts of the International Archaeological Symposium 'Cyprus Between the Orient and the Occident' (1986) 321. See E.

However, if one looks at sites such as Megara Hyblaea with ratios of 18:1 for drinking vs. kraters and 6.5:1 for drinking vs. pouring, and funerary sites in Etruria with 11:1 and 13:1, the only clear indication is that there are twice as many imported pouring vessels in a Greek domestic context compared to an Etruscan funerary one. Another possible explanation for this, which is far more mundane, is that cups may have simply been easier to transport and therefore much more 'profitable'.155 Moreover, cups of just about any kind can be very easily stacked and it is easy to imagine a small corner in a ship containing thousands of cups.156 But other shapes would be far more difficult to transport since shapes like oinochoai and kraters cannot be stacked anywhere near as efficiently as most cups. Finally, and perhaps related to the preceding point, if we look at local production of oinochoai and olpai we see that these were indeed made in considerable volume. Indeed, a look at subgeometric pottery from southern Etruria, at least, shows that a very large number of the shapes are pouring vessels—and oinochoai in particular.157 Such vessels, both drinking and pouring, are usually seen as relating to wine, though strictly speaking we do not know how these vessels were used. Coldstream has pointed out that cups could have been used for eating, but at the same time reflects upon the presence of pouring vessels as indicative of 'the joy of the early colonists in ... the newly introduced vine'.158 Closely related to the connection made between such vessels and wine is the assumption that imported vessels had a social and symbolic dimension and that consumption of both these vessels and eastern exotica helped 'establish and recreate hierarchies by means of distinction and domination'.159 What has often been proposed was that Greek pottery and eastern exotica were seen as exotic imports, valued by the elite as a means of distinguishing themselves, and while this may not have been the means of social change, it was certainly a means of maintenance of the social structure.160 This may well have been the case in some parts of the Mediterranean, but there have been studies which have cast some doubt upon this interpretation. At Veii, for example, an investigation of the Geometric pottery at the Quattro Fontanili necropolis has shown that imported material cannot be associated with any particular sex, with adult or infant, or even with perceived wealth.161 If it is true, as L. Hoffmann contends, that 'Greek pottery apparently belonged to all sorts of people' 151 Crielaard art. cit. (η. 84) 266. 152 See J.-P. Descœudres, 'Al Mina across the Great Divide', Meditarch 15,2002, 56. 153 It has been pointed out before that such proportions would seem to be the norm: J. N.

A final point may be made regarding contexts of the material thus far entered into the database. The material of known contexts consists of 34,926 of the total number of artefacts, or approximately 92.2%. These may be divided as follows: 46.15% domestic, 43.85% funerary, and 10% ritual. This may appear incongruous when one considers the accepted wisdom of the division of Italian site contexts, where it is commonly believed that about 90% of sites are funerary, 8% are domestic, and 2% ritual, but the database shows that in terms of numbers of artefacts, funerary and domestic contexts are approximately equal. 162 Ibid. 132.</page><page sequence="31">Richard Fletcher Plate I 1. 2. 3. 5. 6. 7.</page><page sequence="32">Plate II Richard Fletcher C\J ^~7y&gt; Λ s&gt;3 I if " ft i Ami Ύ^ΤΤΓ^Ζ 11!
