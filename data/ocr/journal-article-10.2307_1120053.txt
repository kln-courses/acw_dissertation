<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROPERTY, RIGHT, AND CONTRACT IN MUSLIM LAW SABA HABACHY* In recent years, some countries whose constitutions proclaim that Islam is the religion of the state and that private property is inviolable have been prominent in nationalizing the assets of foreign nationals in disregard of long-standing contractual obligations.' This phenomenon of our times raises important legal questions relating to the protection of foreign investments in professedly Muslim countries. These questions may be briefly summarized as follows: 1. In the majority of cases, the taking of foreign assets and the violation of contractual obligations has been justified as a measure of retaliation for real or imaginary wrongs. Is such a justification valid according to the teaching of Muslim law? 2. Does Muslim law extend equal protection to private property and other rights of foreigners; or does it discriminate in the treatment of these rights, whether they are in rem or in personam, according to the nationality or faith of their holders? Does a valid contract entered into by a foreigner have sanctity in Muslim law? Does the rule of sanctity of contract apply equally to agreements with foreigners to which the Muslim state is a party? 3. In what respects, if any, and to what extent do the Muslim concepts of private property, right, and contract differ from their counterparts in modern Western systems of law? It is on this last, broader basic question that attention will be focused here. However, the first two groups of questions can be adequately and briefly disposed of by stating the following rules of Muslim jurisprudence: 1. The Shari'a, the Divine Law of Islam, fully recognizes the great moral principle that two wrongs do not make a right. Consequently, re- taliation is not a valid justification for unlawful seizure of property or breach of contract. This is especially true when, as is often the case, the victims of arbitrary action are not responsible for the wrong for which retaliation is sought.

The following two articles of the Majalla, quoted from C. A. Hooper's translation, are pertinent. They appear in part 2 under the title "Maxims of Muhammadan Jurisprudence": Article 19: Injury may not be met by injury.... Article 25: An injury cannot be removed by the commission of a similar injury.2 2. Muslim law does not discriminate against foreigners or non-Muslims in matters of property, right, or contract. Once a right is lawfully acquired, or a contract validly entered into by a foreigner, Muslim law applies to it the same rules and provides it with the same safeguards, regardless of the nationality or religion of the parties concerned. In this respect, the Shari'a has only one weight and one measure.3 Apart from certain exceptions dictated by a state of war, the Muslim community has a duty to respect the private property of non-Muslims and foreigners. Nor does a state of war of itself justify violation of rights or private contracts entered into with foreigners ;4 the rule of law is the same, even if the Muslim state is a party to the contract with the foreigner. Islam does not recognize any right vested in the state to cancel or change a contract by unilateral action, whether such action takes the form of an administrative, judicial, or even legislative act. The rule is clearly established in Muslim law that the ruler can not be judge in his own cause.5 The state has the responsibility of protecting private rights against infringement and private contracts against breach; a fortiori, it must give the good example of respecting the contractual rights it has validly granted to a foreigner. The maxim of the old French law, qui doit la garantie ne pentt evincer (the party who should guarantee can not evict), is equally valid in Muslim law. The Muslim state has no privileged legal position as a contracting party, no overriding right of sovereignty. These principles of Muslim law have found recent application in an international arbitral proceeding between the state of Saudi Arabia and the 2. 1 HOOPER, THE CIVIL LAW OF PALESTINE AND TRANS-JORDON 19 (1933). 3.

In its award given in Geneva on August 23, 1958, the Arbitration Tribunal ruled as follows with reference to a conces- sion granted by Saudi Arabia to the Arabian American Oil Company:6 Moslem law does not distinguish between a treaty, a contract of public or administrative law and a contract of civil or commercial law. All these types are viewed by Moslem jurists as agreements or pacts which must be observed, since God is a witness to any contract entered into by individuals or by collectivities; under Moslem law, any valid contract is obligatory, in accordance with the principles of Islam and the Law of God, as expressed in the Coran: "Be faithful to your pledge to God, when you enter into a pact" (Laoust, Essai sur les doctrines sociales et politiques de Taki-D- Din Ahmad B. Taimiya, Le Caire, 1939, p. 445).7 The principle of equal treatment of nationals and foreigners is seldom denied, even by nations that have confiscated foreign assets. On the contrary, measures of nationalization are often justified on the ground that they are general in character and apply equally to nationals, and that foreigners are not entitled to more favorable treatment than citizens of the confiscating country. I. THE CONCEPT OF PROPERTY RIGHT IN ISLAM Turning to our primary concern, a comparison of the concept of property and private right in Islam with corresponding institutions in modern Western systems of law, a basic difference should be clearly emphasized at the outset: while modern systems of law are secular in charac- ter, Muslim law is of divine revelation. Owing to its heavenly origin, its institutions, such as individual ownership, private rights, and contractual obligations, share in its sacredness. To the authority of law as it is under- stood in the West is added the great weight of religion. Infringement of the property and rights of another person is not only a trespass against the law; it is also a sin against the religion and its God.8 Private ownership and individual rights are gifts from God, and creative labor, inheritance, contract, and other lawful means of acquiring property or of entitlement to rights are only channels of God's bounty and goodness to man. " [V] erily," says the Qiir'an, "the land belongs to Allah, He makes whomsoever He willeth of His servants inherit it . . . ."9 Therefore, encroachment on the property and rights of another person is, according to the terminology of the Muslim jurist-theologians, "Haram."

QUR'AN 7:125 (Bell transl., 1 BELL, THE QUR'AN 149 (1937) ).</page><page sequence="4">1962] MUSLIM LAW 453 term conveys the dual connotation of legal wrong and offense against God. According to the teaching of the eminent Hanbali jurist, Ibn Taimiya, "the first duty of the state is scrupulously to respect private property."'0 In addition, it is no mere coincidence that the Arabic word for boundaries of real estate is "Hudiid," which is precisely the term the Qur'an uses to define the "rights of God" (Hudiid Allah), the trespass of which constitutes what the old French criminal law termed crimes de Le'se Majeste Divine. According to the commandments of the Qur'an, severe punishments must be administered by the Imam for five of these crimes. Highway robbery and theft are two of them. The penalty for the first is death. A thief is punished for the first offense by amputation of the right hand; for the second offense, the left leg is cut off. In the event of further recidivism, the punishment is death. These legal concepts of the sacred character of ownership and individual rights originated in two great legal teachings to which Muslim law was heir: the Judeo-Christian and the Greco-Roman traditions.1' The Arabs are a Semitic people. The text of the Qur'an quoted above is reminiscent of Genesis, 15:7, in which God said to Abraham, "I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it." The same tradition prevailed among the Etruscans and the Romans. In ancient Rome, whose Empire preceded the spread of Islam around the shores of the Mediterranean, boundaries were placed under the protection of the God Terminus, whom Jupiter himself could not dislodge.12 This ancient tradition of placing property under divine protection is discernible in many deeds of trust left by pious Muslims. To protect his WA QF against the greed of rapacious rulers, the Muslim composer of a trust often wrote at the end of his deed a clause de style inviting the male- diction of God, His prophets, and His angels on any prince of this world who violated or changed the trust. Ancient law, like Muslim law, often inflicted capital punishment on the thief, because theft was, in the words of Fustel de Coulanges, un attentat contre la religion de la propriete (a crime against the religious character of ownership). 10.

Jupiter wanted to have a place on Mount Capitulinus for a temple, but he could not prevail on Terminus. "This old tradition," said the great French scholar, "points out to what extent property was sacred; because the immovable boundary (Terme) has no other meaning than that property is inviolable." Fustel de Coulanges also referred to the Etruscan tradition, which much resembles the Israelite concept of ownership-Jupiter gave the land of Etruria to the Etruscans as an inheritance.

Thus, when the great jurist Abdel Aziz Fahmy Pasha13 drafted the Egyptian Constitution of 1923, he included two important words in article 9: Lilmilkia Hurma (property has sacredness). In so doing, he was not only expressing the Muslim concept of property and right, but he was also using the very language of the Qur'an and the classical jurists of Islam. To these jurists the sanctity of property was part of the law of nature and of nature's God.14 Private property and the lesser human rights constituted divinely ordained institutions that were so natural that the Muslim jurist-theologians took them for granted. They never con- sidered it necessary to find a rational or philosophical justification for heavenly inspired rules of law, which to them were self-evident. All Muslim schools teach that private property and rights are inviolable in relations between individuals as well as in relations with the state.'5 No dissenting voice whatever is raised against this teaching. The teaching of the great Hanbali jurist, Ibn Taimlya, is significant in this respect, because he is the Imam whose works have had the greatest influence on the political and legal institutions of a leading Islamic country of our day, Saudi Arabia. This eminent jurist thought that the institutions of property and individual rights were among the incontestable facts of social and economic life. His respect for them was such that he was of the opinion that, while apostasy was punishable by death, the goods, assets, and other rights of economic value of an apostate should not be confiscated. They should devolve upon his legitimate heirs.16 Likewise, zakat, the religious alms-tax, is one of the "foundations"' of Islam for which the first Caliph, Abu Bakr, fought the secessionist tribes of Arabia shortly after the death of the Prophet. Nevertheless, an attempt to make confiscation a penalty for evading zakat was resisted by the Hanbali school. Muwaffaq al-Din Ibn Qudama (d. 1223 A.D.), the Hanbali jurist, wrote: If someone refuses to pay the zakat . . . and the imam is able to collect it from him, he does so and punishes him . . . with ta'zir [a corporal punishment] . . . , but he takes no more than the amount of zakat due. T'his is (also) the opinion of the majority of 13. Abdel Aziz Fahmy Pasha later became the first president of the Supreme Court of Egypt when it was created in 1930.

A Muslim judge could order seizure and imprisonment of a recalcitrant debtor to force him to pay his debts, but he could not order foreclosure of his proprietary or other rights of monetary value to satisfy his unpaid creditors.18 Further, the Muslim state can not take the property of a Muslim or a foreigner, except for projects of public utility after providing adequate compensation.1l Abu 'Yusuf, Haruti Al Rashid's judge and eminienit disciple of the Inam Abu Hanifa, said in Kitab al-K hariYj, which he wrote for that Abbasside Caliph: Neither according to the religion nor according to the law can the sovereign [Imarn] coiicede to anyone what belongs to aniother Muslim or to a person under the protection of the Muslims. Nor can he deprive them of anything they possess, except when he has a legal claim against them. In this case, he may exact fromn them that to which he has a right.20 It is not only by their divine origin that the Muslim institutions of private ownership and right differ from their counterparts in Western systems of law; their content and range of application are more far-reaching. Following the Roman law tradition, Article 544 of the French Civil Code defines ownership as "the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner, provided such use is not prolhibitedI by the laws or by the regulations."21 Modern jurists, however, criticize this definition. They poinit out that, rather than being an absolute right over a thing, ownership is the miost absolute right in repect of a thing. In addition to the explicit legal and regulatory restrictions referred to in the article, there developed the theory 17. See Schacht, Islamic Laze in Conitemt0porary States, 8 Aar. J. Comzp.

Muslim jurists, on the other hand, did not elaborate a theory of misuse of rights. According to the most reliable authorities, such as Santillana, Schacht, Professor Emnile Tyan of the Uni- versity of Beirut, and Professor Chehata of the University of Cairo, the concept of misuse of rights was not part of Muslim law.22 If absolutes can be compared, it can be safely said that the right of ownership in Muslim law is more absolute than it is in modern systems of law. Ownership has been defined by the Muslim jurist Ibn Arafa as "the right of comnplete and absolute disposal" (Kamal At-Tasarruf al Mutlaq).23 It is clear from these expressions that the Muslim concept of property and right is less restricted than is the modern concept of these institutions. The difference between the two has been stressed in a letter from Eboul Hulla Bey, Professor at the University of Istanbul, to an eminent Frenchman, Maurice Pernod, in which he said: You French recognize that a right can cease to belong to a person who, during a certain period, has failed to exercise it; and that such right can pass on to another person who becomes entitled to it through having exercised it in a continuous manner. You are acquainted with an extinctive and an acquisitive prescription. At best, we admit the first; but to us, the second is unthinkable. It appears difficult for us to coinceive that a right of ownership can ever become extinct, and impossible to envisage that prescription can give birth to a right. For us, in conformity with our sacred law, ownership is eternal and can never be abolished. The right of ownership may not be exercised; but, nevertheless it continues to exist. Our laws do not authorize expropriation except in extra- ordinary cases.24 The two restrictions on the absolute character of the right of owner- ship in Muslim law, expropriation for public utility and foreclosure for payment of debts, are of recent introduction. To the classical Muslin jurists expropriation for public utility was unknown, and seizure of property for payment of debts was denied. When they were finially authorized, they were justified as "forced" sales in which the consent of the cadi was sub- stituted for the consent of the unwilling owner to conclude the contract. This "legitimate violence" (ikrah huksni), as it was called by the Muslim jurists, was justified by necessity.25 However, respect for property and right is so deeply rooted in the Muslim conscience that until the present day 22.

The following are illustrations of the law as it is practiced today in Saudi Arabia. One of the rites of pilgrimage to Mecca is perambulation around the Holy Shrine of the Ka'aba. In the days of the late King Ibn Saud, it became highly desirable to clear the Holy Shrine from some constructions that had sprung up in the vicinity of the Ka'aba, in order to facilitate performance by the pilgrims of their religious duties. However, the owners refused to sell these constructions to the government, and the government was reluctant to expropriate them. They thus continued to stand until after the reign of the late King, when, rather thani force them to sell at reasonable prices, the present King paid disproportionately high prices to the owners who finally agreed to part with their property. During the Second \Vorld War, a housing crisis existed in Jeddah. This fact, coupled with the boom produced by the spectacular development of Arab oil, caused rents to soar and inflicted great hardships on salaried employees in government departments and in business. A law placing a ceiling on rents was proposed, but it was not enacted because the Ulamas objected that it constituted an unlawful restriction of the right of the owners to enjoy the income they could derive from their property. Their objections were similar to those of Shafi'i, the founder of one of the four Stnni schools, who refused to recognize the right of the sovereign to fix a fair price, even in cases of scarcity of necessary commodities. "People are masters of the things they own," said Shafi'i, and "nobody has the right to take over these properties, totally or partially, without the consent of their owner, except in cases which are clearly specified in the law." A hadith attributed to the Prophet denies the power of the state to fix prices of commodities under normal conditions. It is reported that in the time of the Prophet prices became very high, and he was asked whether he intended to regulate them. "It is God," answered the Prophet, "who denies, and it is God who gives and dispenses. I hope some day to meet Him, and I do not want a man to bring me to account for an injustice I committed against his person or his property."26 The foregoing, and similar illustrations, indicate that Muslims take their sacred law seriously, and that to them property and right are important tenets of their faith. In this exposition, emphasis has been placed on the right of ownership as being the most extensive right, and as typical of the lesser rights. However, the same sacredness applies to all rights recognized by Muslim law, whether they are in rem or in personam. The former partake of the nature of property, of which they are component parts (de'membrentents); the vast majority of 26.

The source of some personal rights, however, is the sacred law itself. In either case, they are equally protected by the Sliari'a. The concept of right in Muslim law outlined above may be supplemented by the two following comments that apply more particularly to personal riglhts and suggest the great respect that the law accords them. It is apparent from the letter of Eboul Hulla Bey quoted above that Muslim law does not recognize extinctive prescription. While Eboul Hullah Bey was discussing the right of ownership, the priniciples that he enunciated are equally applicable to personal rights. Thus, Article 1674 of the Majalla provides in part: A riglht is not destroyed by the effluxion of time. Consequently, if the defeuidant explicitly admlits and confesses in Court in a case in which the period of limitation has elapsed that the plaintiff is entitled to bring his actioIn, the limitationI is of Ino effect and judg- mient ill be given in accordanice with the admission of the clefendant.2'7 It is interesting to note the miiainner in which Muslim jurists avoided the rule of inidestructibility of rights in Muslim law. It was evident that a statute of limitations was needed in order somehow to extinguislh the past. However, this could not be done by a rule of substantive law, since rights are eternal. Consequently, the limitation was imposed by a procedural rule that witlhdrew authority from the cadi to hear clainms considered too stale to deserve enforce- menlt. Thus, Article 1660 of the MIa,jalla provides that Nctions relating to a debt, or property deposited for safe- keeping, or real property held in absolute ownlership, or inheritance, or actionis nlot relatinlg to the fundlamielntal constitution of a piotus fotindation . . . shall not be heard after the expiration of a period of fifteeni years since action was last taken in connection therewith.28 An heir is not personially botund in law to pay the debts of a decease(d person out of his owIn assets. Onily the estate of the de cujuls is answerable to his creditors. However, anl heir has a personal religious duty to pay the debts of the deceased so that the latter will not be tormented in the hereafter for debts he left uinpaid. Thus, a claim is not totally extinguished by the fact that the deceased person's estate is bankrupt. The claim continues as a moral obligation of the heir, altlhotigh it is not legally enlforceable. 1I. CONTRACT IN MUSLI M LAW A.

Some modern Muslim writers, such as Professor Sobhi Mahmassani of the University of Beirut, doubt that the classical Muslim jurists developed a general theory of contracts.29 While the old schools of Islamic law wrote extensive volumes on specific contracts, such as sale, lease, and hire, it might appear that they left little that can be called a systematic exposition of the principles governing contracts generally. But, in addition to this group of contracts that bear a distinctive name,30 the principle of freedom of contract, which makes any valid agreement binding in Muslim law, was developed.3' Al Muslim ftn 'inda shurfitihim (Muslims are bound by their stipulations) is a traditional rule unanimously recognized in all schools of Muslim law. It may therefore be said that Muslim jurists did formulate a body of rules constituting a general theory of contracts; in fact, Ibn Taimlya has left us a treatise on contracts in his monumental work of Fatawdi (OpilliolnS) .32 At an early stage of its development Muslim law freed itself from the formialism of Roman law. It attached no significance to the distinction between nominate and innominate contracts. It contained no principle similar to the Roman maxim ex nudo pacto non oritur actio. It established the rule that in matters of civil and commercial dealing (Mu'amnalat) any agreement not specifically prohibited by the Divitne ILaw was valid and binding on the parties and could be enforced by the courts. This important principle makes it possible to give effect to contracts that are sui generis. In the award of August 23, 1958, referred to above, the Arbitration Tribunal applied this principle in recognizing the validity of a moderni oil concession agreement of a type that could not have been envisioned by the classical Muslim jurists. "According to the Government's Memorials and to the oral hearings," the Tribunal stated, "Aramco's Concession must be considered as all 'unnomiinated' contract 'sui generis'. This conception of Saudi Arabian Lawr is related to that which is accepted in many other civilized States, but with one distinctive feature: the contractual character of the concession in Saudi Arabian Law is unquestionable.'':13 Furthernmore, Muslim law gives full recognition to the rule Pacta sitnt servanda. "Few rules for the ordering of society," says Professor Hans 29. See 1 MAHMASSANI, THE GENERAL THEORY OF OBLIGATIONS AND CONTRACTS UNDER MUHAMMADAN JURISPRUDENCE 5 (1949). 30.

This is the manner in which Ibn Taimiya expressed the principles of freedom, validity, and binding effect of contract. Basing his argument on God's commandment to the believers to fulfill contracts, the great Hanbali jurist wrote, some six hundred and fifty years ago: "If proper fulfillment of obligations and due respect for covenants are prescribed by the Lawgiver, it follows that the general rule is that contracts are lawful . . . since the Lawgiver recognizes the legality of their objectives."35 However, the concept of contract in Islam does not exist merely as a legal institution necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate human needs. The very foundation of Islamic law is a covenant.36 The Shari'a, the ethic and religion of Islam, has been aptly described as a system of law based on a pact between God and man.37 The entire fabric of the Divine Law is contractual in its concept and content. It is a highly individualistic system, which has been described by such distinguished scholars as the Dutch orientalist Snouk Hurgronje as a system of personal duties and rights. In Muslim law, the concepts of justice (adala) and faithfulness (amana), of reward and punishment, are closely linked with fulfillment of contractual obligations. Dar al Islam (the abode of the Pax Islamzica), as opposed to Dar al Harb (the land of war), is equally characterized in the Muslim theory of the law of nations as Dar al Adl (the land of justice).38 1.

Justice is a necessary qualification for holding public office or performing a civic duty-ranging from giving evidenlce in a court to presiding over the destinies of the Muslin community. The virtue of justice is not judged merely by material performance; a forthright intention (niyya) is also an essential attribute of a just man (adl or siddiq). This forthright intention consists of sincerity and truthfulness and the habit of rigorous and loyal fulfillment of what one has consented to do or not to do.39 Justice binds the believers to their God. It also binds them to their fellow Muslims and even to unbelievers when a pact has been concluded with them. The nature of this bond, what justifies and explains it, is the contractual foundation of the law itself.40 34. See Wehberg, Pacta Sutntt Servanda, 53 AM. J. INT'L L. 775 (1959). 35.

Every public office in Islam, even the Iwamate itself, is regarded primarily as a contract, an agreement (aqd) that defines the rights and obligations of the parties. Likewise, the concept of justice, being based on the faithful and forthright fulfillment of pacts and covenants, dominates Muslim international law.4' These principles have made it possible for Muslim states to join the United Nations, and for private interests to make important investments in Muslim countries. The recent award referred to above is an illustration in point. The Tribunal ruled that because of these liberal principles of the Shari'a, an oil concession agree- ment between Saudi Arabia and an American Company had been validly concluded. The opinion stated: The concession contract does not conflict with these rules, since it is in conformity with two principles of the whole Moslem system of law, i.e. the principle of liberty to contract within the limits of the Divine Law, and the principle of respect for contracts. The first principle is stated by Ibn Taimiya as follows: 'The following rule shall be obeyed: men shall be permitted to make all the transactions they need, unless these transactions are forbidden by the Book [Qur'an] or by the Sunna [the Tradition of the Prophet] . ... The second basic rule, in Ibn Taimiya's opinion, results from the fact that Moslem law does riot distinguish between a treaty, a con- tract of public or administrative law and a contract of civil or commercial law.42 The latter statement is supported by the works of Ibn Taimiya. The Mubaya'a, the act by virtue of which the Imam is invested with supreme authority, is merely a contract between him and the Muslim community, and is no different from a contract of sale.43 The treaty that the Second Caliph Omar concluded with the people of Jerusalem after its conquest by the Muslims is commonly known in Islamic history as the "Contract of Omar." Ibn Taimiya places it in the same category as contracts of marriage and donation.44 2. Faithfulness (Aniana). The Qur'anic Covenant between God and man, which corresponds to the Hebrew Berith, imposes on man the duty of loyalty and faithfulness to his pledged word and scrupulous respect for the rights of others; to this must be added a firm intention of abiding by one's obligations.45 On God's side, the Qutr'&amp;n often repeats that "God will 41. Id. at 94: "The virtue of justice thus binds the believer with regard to his relations with God; it also binds the believers in their relations among themselves; it binds them in their relations to the unbelievers when a pact has been concluded with these latter. The nature of this bond anid its justification find their explanation in the contractual foundation of the law." 42. See Aramco Award 55-56. 43. LAOUST, op. cit. supra note 10, at 287. 44.

The following passage is significatit:</page><page sequence="13">462 COLUM+BIA LAW REVEIEW [Vol. 62: 450 not fail in hiis promise."46 It frequently refers to "a promise binding [literally: "true"] uponl Him in the Torah, the Evangel, and the Qur'an; and who fulfills his covenant better than Allah? So rejoice in the bargain ye have made with Him; that is the miighty bliss."47 To fulfill the requirements of the duty of faithfulness is not ain easy task. The Proplhet Mohammad, the model and example of perfectioni for every Muslim, was kinown, even before the Qur'an was revealed to himii, by the name of al Amin, the faithful one. He acquired this reputation in his youth because of his loyalty aind fair dealing and the miiannier in whicl he discharged his trust as manager of the business of a wealthy Aleccan lady, Khadija, for whose account he traveled with the yearly caravans. His keen awareness of the grave responsibilities that amana imposes, and his condemtnation of those who take it lightly, is reflected in the Qtur'Pn. The term amana in chapter 33 of the Qur'an (Silirat al-AhzJdb), verse 72, is variously translated into English and French by the Muslim jurist, Yusuf Ali, as miieaning "trust" and by the French scholar, Professor Montet of the University of Strasbourg, as meaning "faith." It is difficult inldeed to express in a foreign laniguage the weighty meaning aind resonance of the original Arabic. The following is Yusuf Ali's translation of this verse, in whiclh God says: "\We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth alid the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof; btit man undertook it; he was indeed unijust and foolish."48 According to the classical Ar&lt;abic dictionary, Lisan al-'Arab, "ainana' is the antithesis of "khliyana" (faithlessness, betrayal, or treachery). A hadith of the Prophet says: "Al Amacna ghina" (faithfulness is wealth) ; by this the Prophet meant that an arnin, or trustworthy person, attracts business and consequently becomes rich. Another tradition of the Prophet is: "A person without aniana is a person without religion." The Prophet was once asked: "Who is a believer?" His reply was: "A believer is a person to whom people can trust their person anid their possessions.'49 One last feature of the Muslim concepts of justice aind faithfulness must be emphasized with reference to its bearing on contracts. Before the Divine Law, and before the courts that enforce the Law, the parties to a conitract are on a footing of complete equality. To use the language of Sheikh Rashi(] Rida, a modern Muslim leader ancl scholar: "M\tislim law proclaims equalitv "Quand il s'agit du pacte a observer, la qualite essentielle est la loyant6, le respect de la parole donnee et des droits recoinnius, et l'intention ferme de remplir ses propres obligations." 46.

Machiavelli's ideas in The Prince, which he later repudiated, are far removed from Muslim concepts and doctrine. The duty of loyalty and respect for contract weighs more heavily on the Imam and on everyone who wields authority in the Muslimii communtity than it does on an ordinary individual. The Muslim jurist, Ibn Taimilya, quotes this saying of the Prophet: "For everyone who has committed a breach of faith there shall be a flag [of disgrace]. On the day of judgment it will be hoisted. Its height will be in proportion to the enormity of his breach of faith. No breacher of faith is more unjust than an amzir [prince] who breaks his covenant."'51 The Imnam is not above the lawv. The Muslinm community is a nation ulder God governed by God's sacred law. B. Pacta Sutnt Servanda in Islam In a recent article, Professor Wehberg traced the origin of the principle of the sanctity of contract to the ancient history of Semitic and Chinese civilizations. According to the learned jurist: In ancient times this principle was developed in the East by the Chaldeans, the Egyptians and the Chinese in a noteworthy way. According to the view of these peoples, the national gods of each party took part in the formation of the contract. . . . So it came to be that the making of a contract was bound up in solemn religious formulas and that a cult of contracts actually developed.52 Concerning the origin of the rule in Muslim law, Professor Wehberg wrote: For the Islamic peoples, the principle, Pacta sunt servanda, has also a religious basis: "Muslims must abide by their stipulations." This is clearly expressed by the Koran in many places, for example, wlhere it is said: "Be you true to the obligations which you have undertaken. . . . your obligations which you have taken in the sight of Allah. ... For Allah is your witness."53 True to their Semitic traditions, the Arabs before Islam associated their gods with the formation and execution of their contracts. The Ka'aba, the holy shrine of Mecca, was the abode of their idols, who were witnesses and guarantors of their pacts. When Islam succeeded the period of "ignorance" (Jahilha), it was in the presence of Allah that contracts were concluded and made secure; and it was Allah who became witness thereto and guarantor thereof. A well known illustration of this concept is found in the Qur'dn, 50. See GARDET, op. cit. supra note 18, for a French translation of the passage quoted in the text. 51.

Thus we read in chapter 48 (Sirat al- Fath), verses 10 and 18: Verily those who swear allegiance to thee, swear allegiance really to Allah, the hand of Allah is above their hands; so whoever breaks faith, to his own hurt he breaks it, and to those who fulfil what they have pledged to Allah, He will one day give a mighty reward . .. . Allah was satisfied with the believers, when they were swearing allegiance to thee under the tree, and knew what was in their hearts, so He hath sent down the Assurance upon them and hath recompensed them with a clearing-up near at hand ....54 This practically anthropomorphic picture of the presence of God at the conclusion of a contract is typically Semitic. Once validly concluded, agreements become contracts of Allah, who commands in the Qur'an: "Ful- fil the covenant of Allah when ye [undertake or enter into a covenant] . . . and do not violate oaths after their confirmation, and your having set Allah as guarantor over you; assuredly Allah knoweth what ye do. . Be not like her who unravelled her thread into untwisted strands after it was strong, [a reference to the story of Penelope in the Odyssey] regarding your oaths as merely intrigue amongst you ... In discussing anmana (loyalty, faithfulness), we have already found in the Qur'an an anthropomorphic representation of Trust being offered to the Heavens and the Earth, which refused to bear it. Another such representationi is to be found in chapter 17 (Sfirat al-Isra'), verse 36, in connection with contract: "[F]ulfil the covenant, verily, [the covenant is answerable] ...." This graphic language is much more emphatic than any formulation of the rule Pacta sutnt servanda to be found in any system of law, ancient or modern. Islam, like Judaism, surrounds the original Covenant with God witlh preternatural manifestations to mark the solemnity of the occasion. The Berith and Shama of the Torah57 are reflected in chapter 2, verse 60, of the Q ur'tn, in which God reminds the children of Israel of the Covenant in the following terms: "When We took your compact and raised the mountain over you: 'Lay firm hold of what We have given you, and remember what is in it; mayhap ye will act piously.' "58 The mountain mentioned in this verse is Mount Sinai, where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments. 54. QUR'AN 48:10, 18 (Bell transl., 2 BELL, THE QUR AN 520, 522 (1939)). (Emphasis added.) 55.

Thus we read in chapter 2, verse 172: "[T]hose who fulfil their covenant when they have entered into one, who endure steadfastly under adversity and hardship, and at the time of attack-these are the ones who have spoken truth, they are the ones who show piety."59 The rule Pacta sunt servanda in Judeo-Christian civilization finds its best modern expression in a basic text of the Civil Law of France. Article 1134 of the French Civil Code provides: Agreements legally formed take the place of law to those who have made them. They can not be revoked except by their mutual consent or for causes authorized by the law. They should be carried out in good faith.60 Islamic law lays down exactly the same rules, which are expressed in the three telling Arabic words: Al-Aqd Shari'at Al-Muta'dqdin (the contract is the Shari'a of the parties). In Muslim law, a contract is binding until the end of its term, even if it were concluded with unbelievers. God commands as follows in chapter 9, verse 4, of the Qur'an: "[F]ulfil their covenant up to (the end of) its period; Allah loveth those who show peity.''61 In commutative contracts, according to modern systems of law, there is an implied term of reciprocity, which makes one party's fulfillment of its obli- gations contingent on proper implementation of the contract by the other party.62 This is also true of the Muslin law of contract. The exceptio non ademplati contractus of the Roman jurists is equally valid according to the teaching of the Shari'a. Muslim law likewise emphasizes good faith in the implementation of contracts. Chapter 9, verse 7b, of the Qur'2n lays down the following rule: "[A]s long as they act straight with you, act straight with them; verily Allah loveth those who show piety."63 However, the fact that one party is unhappy with its contract, or believes that it could have obtained or can still obtain a more advantageous offer or better terms from someone else more powerful or more solvent, is not a valid legal ground for termination of contractual obligations.

In com- menting on this verse, Professor Abu Zahra of the University of Cairo wrote in an unpublished opinion: Every covenant of a Muslim is a covenant of Allah, because he makes Allah its witness. It was the custom of Arabs to authenticate covenants with God, making Him a surety and guarantor . The advantages of fulfilling a covenant run to both parties. In saying "a nation being more numerous than (another) nation," God Almiighty refers to the motive that often induces one state to break its covenants with another, i.e., to increase in size, to become richer or more powerful. This should not be allowed or justified in religion. Whoever honors his covenanit, has chosen the right course of action, and whoever dishonors his coveniant, disobeys and breaks the order of God. Chapter 5 of the Qutr'dn is sometimes called in Muslim tradition Sflrat al-Uqi-d, the Chapter of Contracts. Truie to the Semitic way of thinking and belief, Islam surrounds the revelation of this Sftrat with supernatural signs and miracles to mark its exceptional importance in Muslim law and ethics. Several of the classical commentaries on the Qur'dn, such as Tafs.r al-Qur'an al-A 21rn by Ismail al-Qorashi ad-Damashqi and Ruh al-Ma'adni Fi Tafsir al-Qiur'Cn al-A zim by al-Alfissi al-Baghdadi, quote traditionis of the Prophet, goinlg back to 'Aisha and considered authentic by the Irna)m1?

So important was the revelation that the she-camel collapsed under its weight. Commenting on the Chapter of Contracts, Yusuf Ali pointed out in The Holy Qur'an that it begins with an appeal "to fulfil as sacred, all obligations, human and divine."66 In defining Uquid, the Muslim scholar wrote: Obligationis: Uqyd: The Arabic word implies so many things that a wNhole chapter of Commilentary can be written on it. First, there are the divine obligations that arise fromi our spiritual nature and our relation to God. . . . But in our owin human and material life we undertake mutual obligations, express and implied.

The Contract is the Shari'a of the Parties The principle of the binding force of contract as the law of the parties is of vital importance in any system of law, ancient or modern. Although the effects of contractual obligations are, as a rule, limited to the parties to the contract, more law is made by contract than by all the provisions of general legislation combined. For example, the French Civil Code has no more than 2281 articles. The Qur'ain contains several score legal provisions that constitute commandments of a gelneral character. The same is true of legal enactments in every country. But, under the general principles of freedom and biinding force of contract contained in provisions like Article 1134 of the French Civil Code and under rules formulated in such dicta as the Arabic aphorism, Al-Aqd Shari'at Al-Muta'dqidin, ad hoc contractual law is made between parties in millions of transactions that take place every day throughout the world. In Muslim law, however, the practical consequenices of this general rule go far beyond our modern concepts in three respects. First, contract in Muslim law is not merely secular law between the parties. It partakes of the divine origin of the Revelation. It is a Shari'a, that is, literally a sacred law between the parties, and, consequently, it is safeguarded by divine as well as human sanctions. Second, contract in Islamic law has a much more basic and more ex- tensive use thain it has in modern systems of law. In the absence of general rules of positive legislation by human lawmaking bodies, contract is more often resorted to in Islam for the solution of problems that are ordinarily solved by secular laws of a general character. Third, contract in Islam is a factor of flexibility and adaptability of the law to the changing patterns of economic and social life. As case law evolves from individual court decisions, contractual practices over the years constitute usage, and usage is a valid source of law according to the Fiqh, the Muslim science of jurispruclence. This contract-made law keeps a door open for change and protects the system against stagnation, fossilization, and brittleness. The foregoing points call for the following elaboration. 1. The sacred nature of contract. The buildings that house the courts of the West are often decorated with busts and portraits of eminent lawgivers and distinguished judges. The severe iconoclasticism of Islam prohibits such embellishments. However, on the walls of courtrooms in the Middle East 67. Id. at 238 n.682.</page><page sequence="19">468 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol.62:450 hang verses of the Qur'an written in ornamental Arabic script reminding those who sit on the bench that they should judge with justice,68 and those who attend sessions of the court that they should abide by contracts. The text of the Qur'an most often chosen for the latter purpose is that of the opening verse of the Chapter of Contracts: "O ye who have believed fulfil contracts." The verse expresses the rule of law Pacta sunt servanda, with which we are familiar, but with an important difference-in Islam the exhortation to fulfil contracts does not come from a human lawgiver. It is an order emanating from God Himself. To borrow again from the language of the Muslim scholar Yusuf Ali: "This line has been justly admired for its terseness and comprehensiveness."69 While Article 1134 of the French Civil Code makes contracts the law of the parties to them, the corresponding rule of Muslim law makes them the Shari'a, the sacred law of the parties. The Muslim theory of contract has borrowed extensively from the Roman law of obligations. Even the Latin definition vinculum juris is reflected in Arabic legal terminology. The word aqd (contract) is derived from the verb aqada, which means to tie or to bind. The contract of marriage is described in the Qur'an as uqdat, a knot or bond.70 Similarly, the Arabic word for covenant (Mithaq) means a rope or a chain.7' However, Muslim law differs from Roman law in one important respect: Roman law lost its religious character in the early stages of its development and became secular, whereas Muslim law is divine law revealed for all time. Roman law and the modern systems of law based on it represent a law "devised by men for men. "72 "It [is] . . . a law that [can] . . . be changed, if circumstances so required, in much the same way in which it had been formulated."73 Article 1134 of the French Civil Code is an order emanating from a human legislator. Verse 1 of the Chapter of Contracts of the Qur'&amp;n is one of God's important commandments to His creatures. 2. The legislative nature of contract. In modern systems of law, legis- lative enactments by parliaments and other lawmaking bodies ordinarily pro- vide the solutions required from time to time to govern legal situations as they arise. According to the legal theory of Islam, God is the Lawgiver. "Islamic law," says Professor Schacht, "withholds legislative power from the ruler, the government, the state; it only allows [tlhe ruler] . . . to make administrative regulations within the limits which it itself assigns to him 68. See, e.g., QUR'AN 4:61 (Bell transl., 1 BELL, THE QUR'AN 75 (1937)): "Verily Allah commands you to pay back to their owners things entrusted to you, and wlhen ye judge between the people to judge with justice." 69. 1 YUSUF ALI, THE HOLY QUR'AN 238 n.682 (1946). 70.

The legislative power, properly so- called, has been exercised once and for all by the Prophet, or rather by God speaking by the mouth of His Messenger."75 Muslim jurists recognize, how- ever, that there are only a limited number of revealed legal provisions, while human social needs and economic situations are unlimited, ever changing and infinite. Muslim law meets this dilemma by having recourse to the liberal and flexible Islamic principles of freedom and binding force of contract. Saudi Arabia is an illustration in point. True to the teaching of Muslim public law, especially as it is found in the treatise of Ibn Taimlya entitled Siyassa Shr'ia,76 the Fundamental Law of the Hijaz promulgated by the late King Ibn Saud on 21 Safar 1345 (cor- responding to August 31, 1926) provided in article 5: "The adutinistration of the Kingdom is confided to Abd Al 'Aziz Ibn Abd Ar-Rahman Al Faisal Al Sa'uid." But, the article proceeds, "His authority is bound [Mu qayyad] by the principles of the Shari'a."77 Under these conditions, the question arose in 1933 of how Saudi Arabia could seek the cooperation of an American company in the development of its oil resources, which subsequently proved to be vast. The comprehensive Muslim concept of contract provided the answer. Years later, in a conver- sation between the great King and Mr. George W. Ray, Jr., general counsel of the Arabian American Oil Compainy, the importance of the ad hoc law of the contract was strongly emphasized by the King. The story is best told in Mr. Ray's own words, recorded in the discussions with representatives of the Saudi Arabian Government that led to the signing of the Arbitration Agreement of February 23, 1955, concerning the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Aramco: When I first joined Aramco, I had the great pleasure of talking to your fornmer King, one of the greatest men I have ever known. Since I was a lawyer, we naturally began to talk about the law, and about my work here. . . .

The Arbitration Tribunal ruled: Owing to this lacuIna in iMoslemi Law, as taught by the Hanbali School, the Imamn, i.e. H. Li. the King, in his capacity of theocratic Ruler, has the power to adopt such solutions as he deems most appropriate to the general interest. To this end, he can resort to a regime of mining concessions, "in specie" of oil concessions, based on a contract ....79 The Arbitration Tribunal found that, because of the broad use of con- tract in Saudi Arabia, solutions were reached that compared favorably with those current in modern systems of law, and that this enabled Saudi Arabia to satisfy the legal requirements of a business as complicated as an oil enter- prise. The tribunal stated: The contractual niature of the CoIncessioIn does not conflict in the least with the present state of comparative law, of the general prin- ciples of law aind of pure legal science. It is normal to consider that the concession is based upon an agreement between the grantor and the grantee, even in those legal systems which do not charac- terize the concessioin as a contract, since it is never imposed on a concessionaire.80 Application of these principles resulted in the Tribunal's formulating an interesting conclusion concerning the special significance in the Shari'a of the ad hoc law of the contract, which it expressed in the following terms: The Concession Agreement is thus the fundamental law of the Parties and the Arbitration Tribunal is bound to recognize its par- ticular importance owing to the fact that it fills a gap in the legal system of Saudi Arabia with regard to the oil industry. The Tribu- nal holds that the Concession has the nature of a constitution which has the effect of conferring acquired rights on the contracting Parties.8" 3. The flexible and dynamic nature of contract. The third and last point is illustrated by the fact that Muslim law recognizes the gradual law- forming process resulting from contractual practices over the years. In law, as in other domains of human activity, it is easier to imitate and to follow precedent than to initiate and create original solutions for recurrent prob- lems. When the use of contract to meet such situations becomes general and habitual, a usage is established and a body of customary law is created. This 79. See Aramco Award 55. 80. Id. at 57. 81.

The need for varying legal solutions to meet the needs and conform to the practices of changing times was recog- nized by Ibn Qaim al Jawzia, the disciple of Ibii Taimiya, in his classical work, 'Ildmn al Muwaqui'in.82 This classical jurist also emphasized the im- portance of 'Urf (custom) as a source of law in Islam.83 It should be borne in mind that contractual obligations in Muslim law can either be express or implied according to the intention of the parties or the custom prevailing at a given time and place. The close relationship between the concepts of law, custom, and contract in the Shari'a can be briefly summarized by quoting the relevant "Maxims of Muhammadan Jurisprudence" as they are ex- pressed in the Majalla: Article 36. Custom is an arbitrator; that is to say, custom, whether public or private, may be invoked to justify the giving of judgment. Article 37. Public usage is conclusive evidence and actioni nmtst be taken in accordance therewith.... Article 39. It is an accepted fact that the terms of lawx vary with the change in the times. Article 40. In the presence of custom no regard is paid to the literal meaning of a thing.... Article 43. A matter recognized by custom is regarded as though it were a contractual obligation. Article 44. A matter recognized by merchants is regarded as being a contractual obligation between them. Article 45. A matter established by custovi is like a matter estab- lished by law.84 The recognition of custom as a source of Islamic law, especially by the school of the Imamt Abu Ilanifa, whliclh has a following of sixty per cent of the Muslim population of the world today, introduced a factor of flexibility into the system. It converted it from a static body of immutable rules into a dynamic system of law capable of growth and readily adaptable to changing conditions. Abu Hanifa recognized the important role of commercial con- tracts in the formation of customary law as part of the Shari'a. He himself was a successful businessman. Professor Abu Zahra in his work on Abu Hanifa tells us that, to find the appropriate rule of law applicable to a situ- ation in which a revealed text is lacking, Abu Hanifa "looked into the prac- 82.

This, of course, only applies to rules of detail ('fur'u), and not to the general principles (Usul) revealed in the Qtur'an and the Suntta, which are of universal validity for all times and places. 83. 3 id. at 66-67, at which the author elaborates on the necessity for Muslim jurists to follow the custom of the time and locality rather than the outmoded and archaic opinions they find in their classical books. 84.

CONCLUSION The extreme individualism of the Shari'a, described by Snouck Hurg- ronje as a doctrine of duties,86 and its characteristic concept of property, right, and contract, help to explain the anomaly noted at the outset of this article-actions by Islamic states to take properties and repudiate contractual obligations in the name of sovereignty or of a so-called superior interest of the community are in sharp contrast to the principles of the Shari'a. They are not "Islamic." Their inspiration is derived from a rival socialist phi- losophy, which, at the present time, is incessantly attempting to infiltrate one Muslim cotuntry after another. In this struggle of ideologies, lip service is often paid to Islam, while its precepts are being undermined by secular legis- lative measures that constitute a complete departure from its teaching. Per- haps the tilie is past whien a Sleikh al-Isla7n, such as Zambelli Aly, could stuccessfully stand up against a Selim I, the most ruthless of the Sultans of Turkey, when the latter tried to ignore the acquired contractual rights of his Christian subjects and force them to embrace Islam. Nevertheless, the Slari'a still constitutes an ideal of justice and faith deeply rooted in the conscience of every Muslim community. Faiths and ideals can be temporarily eclipsed, but are not easily eradicated. Furthermore, over a period of more than thirteen centuries the Shari'a has not only proved its vitality in the face of opposing cults and doctrines, but has also experienced intense movements of revival, such as the Wahhabi reform in Arabia. Thle two coincepts of the Shari'a that the contract is the law of the parties and that contracts are binding are, in the words of George WV. Ray, Jr., among the principles that "have a way of surviving after being challenged-and powerfully challenged -by devices." They also "have a way of demonstrating their efficacy,"' while devices, on the contrary, have a way of demonstrating "their deficiency."87 To what extent are these concepts of Muslim law still relevant in inter- national relations under present conditions? More than one hundred years ago, when the great issue of freedom from slavery was hotly debated in this country, Abraham Lincoln said that a nation can not live half slave and half free. Today, another freedom is at issue among members of the international community-freedom from want. It can be said with equal truth that the world can not live at peace half starved and half affluent. However, economic development requires the free flow of capital investments to where they are 85. See ABU ZAHRA, ABu HANIFA: His LIFE, His AGE, His OPINIONS AND HIS METHODOLOGY 350 (1947). 86.

Islam still governs the lives of some four hundred million people around the globe. Will the Shari'a concept of property, right, and contract prevail, or will its principles give way under the assault of secular doctrines of socialist inspiration? The future of international economic cooperation and the flow of foreign investments to Islamic countries depend on the answer to this question.</page></plain_text>
