<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Destructive Power of Religion: Violence in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Four volumes. Edited by J. Harold Ellens. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 2004. np. The twentieth century was plagued by an unprecedented degree of violence, with religion providing the major impetus for much of the bloodshed around the world. Unfortunately, the twenty-first century has yet to break free from the shackles of this destructive cause and effect relationship. With erudition and foresight, this four-volume work offers an unsettling but thought-provoking examination of the relentless cycle of religiously motivated violence, initiating a valuable dialogue for those seeking to expose religion's destructive tendencies while also providing its more constructive potential to faster peace. Introducing Volume One, J. Harold Ellens highlights how the three major monotheistic world religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-—have absorbed over the centuries a psychological archetype diat mandates an unrelenting quest for a final solution to the "cosmic conflict between God and devil, between all things good and all things evil" (p. 7). Because this inherently violent model of reality has only wearied and burdened human existence, Ellens challenges modern civilization to shed this "awful betrayal" of life's significance and, instead, embrace the true meaning of grace and human growth. His general thesis is elaborated upon by seven other scholars who seek to address this conundrum of religion and violence. Charles T. Davis III, in his article "The Evolution of a Pauline Toxic Text," alerts Christians to the potentially caustic elements of scriptural interpretation. Specifically, he examines the tendency of Christians, who are on a "quest for theological unity and historical continuity," to idealize the "superior character" of the Apostle Paul, through his "toxic" texts, thus subconsciously and consciously subjugating or disposing of the "other's" story, inevitably anathe matizing Jews and non-Christians as a perverse alternative to the correct</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 165 pathology of truth. Davis urges a more balanced approach to interpreting the Pauline texts, remaining circumspect of the underlying urge to demonize the enemy and "thus betraying the ethical obligation of love taught by Jesus" (p. 205). In "The Qur'an, Muhammad, and Jihad in Context," Davis briefly examines the unique historical processes for the development of scripture in each of the three major monotheistic religions, emphasizing, for instance, that because law rather than theology serves as the central focus in Islam, Westerners must modify their underlying conception of religion to recognize that instead of the church or synagogue, the Islamic state remains "central for the religious life of the Muslim" (p. 241). Moreover, as Davis reviews the concept of Muslim jihad and Christian just war, in light of the unconscious archetypal warrior plot or template, the differences, as well as similarities, between Jewish, Christian, and Muslim interpretation and development of scripture become more apparent, instilling a clearer understanding and appreciation of the unique variables within and across these global traditions. Volume two offers an intriguing look into the inextricable relationship between theology and psychology, as "lenses through which the world of divine and human reality may be discovered" (p. 1). Mack C. Stirling begins the volume with a thorough and encapsulating look at "Violent Religion: René Girard's Theory of Culture." His lucid exposition of Girard's mimetic theory of human relations reveals how human cultures' utilization of the "scapegoat mechanism" helps to explain the regicides of the European revolutions over the past four centuries and the horrific genocides of the twentieth century. He argues that God's revelation through Jesus Christ and the Cross has liberated Christians from the endless cycle of mythology—"Chaos, surrogate victimage, order"—thus setting "us free from ignorant scapegoating of innocent victims" in order to seek mimesis from the ultimate model of forgiveness and compassion, Jesus Christ (pp. 49-50). In her article, "Judaism, Christianity, and Girard: The Violent Messiahs," Cheryl McGuire also utilizes Girardian theory to explain the historical tendencies across all three monotheistic faiths to find peace through religiously sanctioned violence and zealotry. She highlights religion's insatiable and self-destructive demand for the killing of "sacrificial scapegoats," culminating in the "extreme mimetic crisis called war" (p. 74). In chapter fourteen, "Religion and Violence: From Pawn to Scapegoat," Paul N. Anderson contends that, while religion has been utilized as a means of justification for political violence and conflict, it is unfair to see this "yoking of religious political equity" as always legitimized by the "authentically religious." Anderson calls for a more balanced appraisal of religion's culpability in societal violence with its perhaps even greater contri bution to effect "good and redemption" in the same chaotic world. He urges religious adherents to be wary of those who seek to co-opt religious power as an extrinsic, ulterior motive of a political equity—as either a pawn or a scapegoat—that seeks to tap into religion as a source of justification for temporal injustices and atrocities. Volume three focuses upon Models and Cases of Violence in Religion, where scholars from a broad swath of expertise and perspectives present a dialogue that extends beyond the constructive capacity of sacred scripture to</page><page sequence="3">166 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE focus more emphatically upon the destructive capacity that the inspiration of sacred scripture can have on cultures, communities, and individual persons. Editor J. Harold Ellens contributes a chapter, "Jihad in the Qur'an, Then and Now," in which he examines both the complexity and manipulation of the Islamic concept of jihad. Ellens explains the emergence of jihad as a principle of sanctification, predominantly expressed in the Qur'an as a striving "to establish an order and economy upon the earth and in the communities of humankind that reflect the will of God"; it calls upon the faithful "to work diligently against the evil impulses in ourselves and, by extension, to do the same in human society" (pp. 45-46). Ellens, however, laments how this more irenic view of jihad, which long prevailed during the golden ages of Muslim power, was subsequently taken hostage by the "wretched interpretations" of "the fanatics of our day," like Osama bin Laden, who narrowed its meaning to "a crusade of terror to exterminate Americans wherever they can be found" (p. 46). Ellens contends that militant fundamentalist Islam, because of "its sense of inferiority in power and its sense of arrogant superiority in spiritual and religious quality," feels justified in asserting the rarer and much more aggressive and warring form of jihad authorized in the Qur'an (p. 43). "They have stolen an originally redemptive theological principle of Islam," writes Ellens, "and have bastardized it to serve their own power strategies and manipulative purposes with no regard to the deep historic strains of true Islam . . . , namely, the perception of God as a God of grace, mercy, and peace" (p. 51). Congruous to Ellens's discussion of the historical and prophetic precedent of war as a divinely endorsed form of jihad, Grant R. Shafer, in "Hell, Martyrdom, and War: Violence in Early Christianity," argues that Christianity, from the age of Constantine forward, would espouse, through such respected patriarchs as Augustine, moral neutrality and divine sanction of war. Shafer exhumes the military language embedded in the New Testament and other biblical and extrabiblical resources on martyrdom to illuminate how, because of the violent ingredients found in Christian eschatology, the cult of martyrs, and the expedient character of early Christian nonviolence, "it should come as no surprise that when the Christians gained control," they hesitated only briefly to use violence against their enemies as well as each other (p. 242). Contemporary Views on Spirituality and Violence is the title of the fourth and final volume. Here, a dialogue is broached between the place of religion in contemporary society and religion's profound influence for both nonviolent and violent behavior in our modern world. Walter Wink argues, in "Beyond Just War and Pacifism: Jesus' Nonviolent Way," that beyond the two classical interpretations of Jesus' teachings on the Christian response to evil—either fight of flight—Jesus, instead, unambig-uously advocates a third and only way of life: the way of nonviolent resistance. From the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus offers a sense of "divine immediacy" to die social implications of the day, enabling the oppressed to recapture their dignity and recover their humanity now through a proactive nonviolence that forces the oppressor to perceive them in a new light (pp. 65-66). In "Genocide or Jesus: A God of Conquest or Pacifism?," professor Paul Anderson recognizes Wink's lucid and creative</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 167 insight into the Matthean account of Jesus' teaching on nonviolence and offers his own thought-provoking analysis of the unsettling tension and moral implications of God's command of genocide in the Old Testament and call to love our enemies in the New Testament. Anderson unpacks this seeming contradiction and helps to clarify God's divine unitive will to love and provide for his children. As we consider the "anthropomorphic projections involved in the narrative traditions, writes Anderson, "God's consistent and loving character comes through in both of these disparate parts of the Bible" (p. 51). Separating the voice of humanity from the voice of the divine is a centerpiece of this systematic work. The cosmic conflict between good and evil is a battle inherent to the human soul and consequently it is manifested in our theological assumptions, political strategies, and social ethics. Tragically, violence has often been deemed the final solution. Over two dozen experts have thoroughly researched and constructively analyzed the perplexities surrounding the affinity between religion and violence, providing a panoply of perspectives and antidotes. Overall, this work issues a bold challenge to religious adherents to confront the destructive power often associated with religious conviction in the hope of instead celebrating and embracing the more meaningful, redemptive, and healing power of religion.
