Watson (English); Professor R. Killick (French); Professor B. Richardson (Italian); Dr D. J. George (Hispanic); Professor T.

A full list of titles published in this series may be found on the Association's website at http://texts.mhra.org.uk. Recent Titles Vol. 56: Anthony Lappin, The Medieval Cult of Saint Dominic of Silos, 2002. (ISBN 1-902653-91-2) This study examines the rise to prominence of one ofthe most important of saints' cults in medieval Spain and its development throughout the Middle Ages. It interrogates neglected texts such as the late eleventh-century Vita Dominici Exiliensis and the late thirteenth-century Mirdculos romancados (as well as artistic representations and works written outside Silos). A variety of approaches are employed to draw as round a picture as possible ofthe functioning of this saint's cult, from analysis of the manuscript traditions of the various works discussed to a consideration of the anthropology of Silos as a pilgrimage centre. Vol. 57: Erika Milburn, Luigi Tansillo and Lyric Poetry in Sixteenth-Century Naples, 2003. (ISBN 1-902653-97-1) Luigi Tansillo is one ofthe most interesting and representative ofthe Petrarchist poets active in Naples during the mid-sixteenth century. This study reconsiders his substantial lyric corpus from a variety of perspectives, opening with a survey of the textual tradition and previous critical work on his verse. Four of Tansillo's lyric collections are examined in depth, and read from narrative and thematic points of view. Particular emphasis is placed on the evolution of the collections, by exploring the ways in which very different types of narrative implying different underlying poetics can be constructed using often identical poems. Parallel to this is a consideration of Tansillo's place within the broader literary-historical context, and his use of verse as a political and ideological tool in the service of the Spanish viceroy of Naples. Vol. 58: Emily Jeremiah, Troubling Maternity: Mothering, Agency, and Ethics in Women's Writing in German of the igyos and ig8os, 2003. (ISBN 1-9043 50-10-0) The question of maternity is crucial for feminists, to whom it represents both challenge and inspiration, as it is for many thinkers engaged with the issues of agency, corporeality, and ethics. This examination puts forward the idea of a 'maternal performativity', drawing on the work of Judith Butler and numerous other feminist theorists, to offer new ways of looking at 1970s and 1980s literary texts by ten German-speaking women writers, including Barbara Frischmuth, Elfriede Jelinek, Irmtraud Morgner, and Karin Struck. It argues that as yet, maternal agency has not adequately been theorized?a project which is urgent, given the traditional view in Western culture of the mother as passive?and suggests that Butler's notion of performativity can assist in this task. Vol. 59: Claire Taylor, Bodies and Texts: Configurations of Identity in the Works of Ablucia Angel, Griselda Gambaro, and Laura Esquivel, 2004. (ISBN 1-904350-12-7) This book considers the novels of three Latin American writers, the Argentinian Griselda Gambaro, the Colombian Albalucia Angel, and the Mexican Laura Esquivel, and examines their work in relation to the formation of feminine identity. Concentrating on two novels of each writer in turn, the book considers how their writings may be seen to engage with the production of identity in the era of transference from a modern to a postmodern aesthetic. Two broad focuses are used in the reading of these novels: the reworking of the intertext, and the crafting of the body. Vol. 60: Sarah Sanchez, Fact and Fiction: Representations of the Asturian Revolution (ig34-igj8), 2004. (ISBN 1-904350-13-5) Vol. 61: Parvati Nair, Configuring Community: Theories of Community Identities in Contemporary Spain, 2004.
