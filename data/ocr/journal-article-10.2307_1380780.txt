<plain_text><page sequence="1">February 1983 the chemistry of glandular secretions. But, then, several areas which Wilson (1978, Science, 199:1058-1059) mentioned as being in the forefront of animal communication research in general are touched upon at various levels: the role of context in the meaning of signals, the physiology of the receptor system, the classification of messages, and their meaning. Work on the decomposition of the complex signals into components and the idea of evolutionary optimum design in mammalian olfactory communication are obviously further off. Most work on function still tries to relate some substance to some one function, without addressing other possible hypothesized functions. Most of the research concentrates on the sender and the signal, not the receiver. The lack of much truly interdisciplinary work among chemists and mammalogists is reflected in the current volume. Only one chapter is even co-authored. The two chapters on carnivores could have been combined. In general, the volume reflects the continuing attempt to be more explicit about scent communication in the field so that function can be understood from observation. It also shows a growing trend to mix observational studies with experimentation. It is therefore striking and unfortunate that three of the five papers on reproduction and growth in the laboratory deal with murid rodents (and one is on domestic pigs), whereas four of the five papers on social structure deal with larger mammals more easily observed in the field. The fifth, on the role of urine in prosimian territoriality, presents laboratory work closely tied to field studies. The book is well edited. Indexing is suitable and the binding is par for the symposia series. The chapter on "odour-producing organs" would have benefitted from the inclusion of binomial nomenclature. The term "pheromone" is used without definition. Its meaning and utility, currently topics of debate, could have been discussed in the chapter on evolutionary aspects or the one on odor-producing organs. The price of the volume to this reviewer is absurd. The volume will have limited use in teaching and research because of the varying degrees to which the papers are truly reviews and/or present new ideas, although it may be hard to score high on both of these simultaneously. The book should be read by all those interested in mammalian olfaction, social structure, and reproduction, and it can be read for pleasure by anyone interested in mammals.-FREDERICK J.

Mamm., 64(1):187-188, 1983 Murie, Adolph. THE GRIZZLIES OF MOUNT McKINLEY, Sc. Monogr. Series No. 14 USDI Natl. Park Service, Washington, D.C. xvi + 251 pp. 1981. $6.00. This book provides us with a broad view of life in Mount McKinley National Park, especially from the "viewpoint" of the grizzly. The reader gains a real confidence in the observations and conclusions of Adolph Murie, mostly because of his basic and deep sincerity evident throughout the book. Above all, anyone who knows wild animals, will appreciate the intricate and detailed descriptions of grizzly habitat and habits, even while being disturbed by the few quantitative data and systematic observations. The sheer magnitude of excellently reported detail gives one a sense of a surprising amount of quantitative data lying there, but "still wrapped in words." It will seem unfortunate to some, perhaps, that the information was not presented to serve long-term and modern day management needs. If more of the various types of data had been briefly recorded in tables, versus the sometimes rambling and repetitive individual accounts, the book could have saved the reader much time, and could have automatically made the information more complete and useful. Some of the lengthy, descriptive accounts add to the book, and were rightly retained, but they could have been shortened by presenting the hard data separately. The reporting style used, in fact, makes some portions of the book downright tedious. Moreover, some of the data presented are clearly weak because of the methodology employed. A re- searcher may find himself screaming silently for the use of a data sheet to systematically record the data "being watched." Some sections, such as the part on carcasses of killed bears (page 10), tantalize the reader with omissions; other sections, especially where unmarked bears are positively identified, or where a good set of data was not quantified and evaluated by the observer, make a trained researcher grimace. Several anthropomorphic presentations of data and grizzly behavior, e.g., ". . . the bears were always chummy .... ," or "(the cub) . . . was in disfavor .... ," and the misuse of the term cubs for subadults, only detract from the book, as does the scarcity of literature citations. Overall, however, the many magnificent descriptions of grizzlies going about their affairs will be appre- REVIEWS 187</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY ciated by any reader. The downright beautiful accounts of family, bear-to-bear, and bear-to-other-species relationships, are worth the price of the book's faults. The spirited cry for allowing the grizzly dignity and freedom in his domain, rather than intensive, modern-day research and management programs, is like a last glimpse of a beautiful world gone forever, and is, perhaps, a fitting way to end the book.-CHARLES JONKEL, School of Forestry, University of Montana, Missoula, MT 59812. J. Mamm., 64(1):188-190, 1983 Eisenberg, J. F. THE MAMMALIAN RADIATIONS: AN ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN EVOLUTION, ADAPTATION, AND BEHAVIOR. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, xx + 610 pp., 1981. Price $45.00. This is a book of courageously broad scope which, as suggested by its subtitle, attempts synthesis of a vast body of data in search of patterns of anatomical-physiological adaptation and behavior; the approach is evolutionary throughout, with emphasis on development of sociality. It is in large part an evolutionary interpretation of basic ecological data as applied specifically to mammals. Although I saw no revolutionary insights welling from the compendium, its very breadth contributes in a major way to appreciating the complexity of variables in mammalian evolution. The book's airy format is attractive, the illustrations generally excellent, the binding solid, and the price reasonable. In light of the fact that roughly 3% of the nearly 1,800 cited references were authored or coauthored by Eisenberg, the book is very much a personal statement interpreting mechanisms underlying the evolutionary history of Mammalia. The book is in 34 chapters, divided into four major parts. Part 1 ("Historical Perspective") includes an introduction to the paleontological and paleobiogeographical record plus summary features of monotremes and marsupials and "primitive" eutherian groups (including edentates, pholidotes, and Madagascan tenrecs). There is also discussion of the phylogeny of elements of mammalian behavior. Part 2 ("Mammalian Radia- tions on the Contiguous Continental Land Masses") provides summary information, emphasizing natural history, on the remainder of living mammals plus a brief section on trends in adaptation and distribution. Abundant, generally well-considered natural history and distributional information is presented, but some errors exist (e.g., a statement that Old World pikas ". . . are confined to the mountainous areas of East Asia .... "). Part 3, the meatiest part of the book, pulls together an amazing diversity of information (much of which is presented in a multiplicity of original and imaginatively-constructed bivariate plots) on consider- ations of comparative metabolic rates, body size, longevity, feeding, brain development, and reproduction as each contributes to life history "strategies." Part 4, restricted to behavior, is "Eisenberg" from beginning to end. It is skillfully built upon physical-biological constraints presented in preceding sections, and empha- sizes complexities and parallelisms involved in development of social organization. Six important appendices (bases for many data summaries in the text) follow, including: (1) a taxonomy (complete to family-level, with selected genera); (2) weights and measures of selected species; (3) longevity records; (4) reproductive data; (5) selected metabolic rates; and (6) selected encephalization quotients. Sources of highly diverse data consistently are given in the appendices, tables, figures, and text, and much of it derives from the author's own research; some data unpublished elsewhere are included. The book concludes with a glossary (57 entries), reference list, technical index (roughly 1,000 numbered entries), and index of common names (333 citations). The roughly 450 pages of text are generally well written, simply presented, and clearly understandable. The author was careful to separate interpretations derived from captive versus field studies, and attempted to show that the two approaches are not always incompatible. He repeatedly emphasized need for more field data, and I belive the book will have important impact in stimulating renewed interest in collection of natural history information (". . . it should be obvious that basic data on life history and behavior are essential for advancement in the subdiscipline of ecological energetics and productivity"). Studies will be spurred to fill major gaps in data sets, and thereby allow multivariate analyses where only bivariate corre- lations are now possible. The book will serve many as a "starting point" for reference data available on a wide diversity of subjects. It could be used appropriately in a second collegiate course in mammalogy, following general introductions to the various groups. Parts 1 and 2 have highly valuable tables for many major taxa that are designed to lead the reader to original references on ecology, behavior, reproduction, and general reviews. New classi- fications, that I think have considerable utility, are presented for feeding habits-substrate relationships and for mammalian social organization. 188 Vol. 64, No. 1</page></plain_text>
