<plain_text><page sequence="1">Teaching Baudelaire , Teaching Translation =7 JONATHAN CULLER In Nicholson Baker's novel The Anthologist , Paul Chowder, a poet and anthology maker, describes encountering poems in the New Yorker or an- other magazine: You locate the poem, because you're naturally curious to see what this week's or this month's trawl is. . . . There it is. You take in the title - "Way Too Much." Way too much: Okay! And then you check the name of the writer - hmm, Squeef Corntoasty, never heard of him. Or: I sure have seen Squeef Corntoasty's name popping up in a lot of places lately. Or if it says "translated from the Czech by Bigelow Jones," forget it, you instantly move on, because translations are never any good. Well, wait - that's not fair. That's ridiculously unfair. I've read some wonderful translations. . . . But my heart does droop when I see that it's a translation. (68-69) We say poetry is what gets lost in translation - an adage that suggests the hapless lot of the translator. Translating poetry is a mug's game. Most enter- prises offer at least some hope of success, but the translator of poetry operates in a context where failure is defined as inevitable. Doomed to struggle with the differences between languages and with the material of languages them- selves, you have little hope of producing something that will be praised. The most you can hope for, it seems, is that people will take enough notice of your translation to point out the aspects of the original that it fails to capture. The author is Class of 1916 Professor of English and professor of comparative literature at Cornell University. A version of this paper was presented at the 2009 ML A convention in Philadelphia.

When I teach a course on Charles Baude- laire, I generally get quite a few students who want to take a course with me but whose French is weak and who need the help of translations. My policy has been that the state of their French is their problem, not mine - I'm not going to stop to translate. But I have found that the presence of linguistically challenged students and the introduction of translations into the discursive space of the classroom can actually be pedagogically beneficial. If we look at a translation or translations alongside a poem by Baudelaire, questions about the effectiveness and accuracy of a translation are a spur to discussion. The students with a better knowledge of French are happy to display this for the benefit of their less fortunate peers. And, particularly important for me, the route through translation provides an easy way to raise questions about formal features of the poems, which in ordinary discussions either get neglected or else require an insistence by the teacher that seems fussy and pedantic. Usually, when discussing a poem, asking questions about the meter or rhyme scheme seems an academic distraction from the interpretive question of what the poem means, but since formal patterning - meter, rhyme, other sorts of pho- nological repetition - is one dimension on which poem and translation will differ markedly, the subject comes up naturally when translation is in play. Questions about the choices affecting rhythm, meter, rhyme, and phonological patterning are immediately relevant. They are not easy to answer, but they are unavoidable. Moreover, commenting on something that a translation missed seems less high-stakes to students than offering an interpretive comment to a large seminar. Translations can also gener- ate disagreement more easily than discussion about the poem itself. If these days students are less inclined to disagree with one another in class than they used to be, disagreeing about a translation seems to involve less of a challenge to the other person. Above all, comparing translations highlights features of the original. If we are discussing Baudelaire's "Correspondances," whose famous first stanza runs La Nature est un temple où de vivants piliers Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles; L'homme y passe à travers des forêts de symboles Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers. (11) we might compare first some prose translations. Keith Waldrop, win- ner of the National Book Award, translates the first stanza: "Nature is</page><page sequence="3">JONATHAN CULLER III 93 a temple whose columns are alive and often issue disjointed messages. We thread our way through a forest of symbols that peer out, as if rec- ognizing us" (14). Clive Scott offers a version "that tries to push prose as close to a verse translation as it can": "Nature is a temple: from time to time, its living pillars sibylline, let slip bewildering words. We pass along these aisles, through symbols forest-thick, followed by eyes that know our minds" (159-60). Scott's version is more engaging, doubtless because of the half rhymes or assonances that give the passage some structure ( time-sibylline-minds , aisles-eyes) and because of the more clearly articulated rhythm (Scott says he is trying to create a text with "a firm bearing rhythm" [160]), and it boldly marks the confuses paroles as "sibyl- line," unclear yet enigmatic and potentially prophetic rather than simply disjointed (Baudelaire's rhyming oí paroles and symboles is relevant here). Scott also makes a choice about regards familiers, which is ambiguous in the French - familiar to us, or overly knowing - rendering in a different way ("know our minds") some of the uncanniness that in the French may stem from this ambiguity. Waldrop's "thread our way" is a skillful rendi- tion of passe à travers , which most verse translations do not try to capture, but his "as if recognizing us" not only is clunky but strangely introduces an "as if" focused on action rather than on the uncanny quality of these symbols. His "peer out," however, while somewhat awkward, especially with the transposition of forêts into the singular, does hint at the paranoia that may lurk behind this verse of Baudelaire's (think of Nerval's "Crains, dans le mur aveugle, un regard qui t'épie" ["Fear in the blind wall a look that spies on you" (my trans.)]). But both these translations, perhaps be- cause of the normalizing pull of prose, shift the third person to the first- person plural, from Phomme to "we," which is out of keeping with the deliberate impersonality of the poem (as contrasted with, say, Baudelaire's sonnet "Obsession," which translates this impersonal situation into psy- chological terms: "Grands bois, vous m'effrayez comme des cathédrales" (75; "Woods, you scare me like cathedrals" [my trans.]).1 Though the translators might argue that today "man" is tied to presumptions of male privilege that are irrelevant to the poem (though certainly not to Baude- laire in general!), still the insertion of a first-person pronoun in a poem distinctive for its lack of them transforms the poem in a significant way. How do these compare with verse renderings? Roy Campbell, Fran- cis Cornford, James McGowan, Allen Tate, and Richard Wilbur all use "man," the appropriate term to oppose to Nature in the parallel structure Baudelaire sets up and a term that may be less ideological in verse than in normalizing prose.2 William Crosby offers "mankind," which could in principle be a good solution, despite its breaking of the parallelism,</page><page sequence="4">94 III TEACHING BAUDELAIRE, TEACHING TRANSLATION though his future tense, "Here mankind will cross by" either projects a singular future event, which is something quite different, or imagines a destiny with an unclear "cross by": Nature is a temple where the living pillars Permit from time to time confused words to escape; Here mankind will cross by, where symbols take the shape Of forests gazing on his progress like familiars. (29-31) His choice brings out, by deviating from the original, the fact that Baude- laire's sonnet imagines not a singular passage but a general condition of passage through a world rendered enigmatically meaningful. The hex- ameter that Crosby uses in lines 2 and 3, though capturing the balance that often marks the French alexandrine, seems long in English, replete with extra syllables. Richard Howard and Richard Wilbur give us rhymed pentameter quatrains that share something of the effect of Baudelaire's alexandrines, which do not often divide into equal hemistiches. The pillars of Nature's temple are alive and sometimes yield perplexing messages; forests of symbols between us and the shrine remark our passage with accustomed eyes. (Howard 15) Nature is a temple whose living colonnades Breathe forth a mystic speech in fitful sighs; Man wanders among symbols in those glades, Where all things watch him with familiar eyes. ( Baudelaire in English 19 [trans. Wilbur]) Comparing those two translations, I would quarrel with Howard's "for- ests of symbols between us and the shrine," which projects a divine center that is precisely lacking in Baudelaire's nature as temple, though Howard's "and sometimes yield perplexing messages" is more economical than Wil- bur's fanciful "Breathe forth a mystic speech in fitful sighs." Is anything gained by imagining the confuses paroles as sighs? One could go on; the point is that this sort of comparison is a good way into both the meaning and the formal features of a poem. But the approach I have been discussing still assumes that one knows what the original means and then examines translations to see how far and in what ways they fall short. Scott in his wonderful, difficult book Translating Baudelaire suggests that we ought to think about translation differently. Instead of assuming that we know what the source text means, can we not imagine that "the translator does not draw meaning out of the source text and embody it in another language but instead confers</page><page sequence="5">JONATHAN CULLER III 95 meaning on the source text by using another language" (177)? Marilyn Gaddis Rose has argued that translation should be more widely used as an instrument of literary criticism. Attempting to put a poem into another language helps us get inside literature; it forces us to consider meaning in a new way, producing an "interliminal" space of possible meanings: at- tempting a translation helps us discover what the source text might mean - which is faithful to the most elementary use of translations to discover the meaning of texts we cannot read in the original (13, 7). Scott goes further in his experiments of conferring meaning by changing one fixed form into another - translating the sonnet "A une passante," for example, into a villanelle and "Le balcon," a poem written in five-line stanzas where the fifth line repeats the first, into a rondeau. "The process of translation itself," Scott writes, "provides an opportunity to put these forms under much greater expressive pressure, to oblige them to carry more emotional freight, and ultimately to test their capacities . . . how well will a villanelle withstand the strains of a Baudelairian sonnet? And what counter-claims will a villanelle wish to make on that sonnet, and will they be justified, and could they be enhancing?" (97) - a provocative question. Here is Baudelaire's sonnet: La rue assourdissante autour de moi hurlait. Longue, mince, en grand deuil, douleur majestueuse, Une femme passa, d'une main fastueuse Soulevant, balançant le feston et l'ourlet; Agile et noble, avec sa jambe de statue. Moi, je buvais, crispé comme un extravagant, Dans son œil, ciel livide où germe l'ouragan, La douceur qui fascine et le plaisir qui tue. Un éclair... puis la nuit ! - Fugitive beauté Dont le regard m'a fait soudainement renaître, Ne te verrai-je plus que dans l'éternité ? Ailleurs, bien loin d'ici ! trop tard ' jamais peut-être ! Car j'ignore où tu fuis, tu ne sais où je vais, О toi que j'eusse aimée, ô toi qui le savais! (92-93) Amid the deafening traffic of the town, Tall, slender, in deep mourning, with majesty, A woman passed, raising, with dignity In her poised hand, the flounces of her gown; Graceful, noble, with a statue's form. And I drank, trembling as a madman thrills, From her eyes, ashen sky where brooded storm, The softness that fascinates, the pleasure that kills.</page><page sequence="6">96 III TEACHING BAUDELAIRE, TEACHING TRANSLATION A flash . . . then night! - О lovely fugitive, I am suddenly reborn from your swift glance; Shall I never see you till eternity? Elsewhere, far off! Too late! never, perchance! Neither knows where the other goes or lives; О you whom I would have loved! О you who knew it! (Maclntyre 157; trans, of final line modified) Scott gives us two villanelle versions. A less radical free-verse villanelle "enacts the poet's attempt to transform a set of aural pressures and disor- ders [as in 'La rue assourdissante autour de moi hurlait'] into an exclusiv- ity of the eye." But his rhymed villanelle translation is an extraordinarily bizarre rendering that highlights a number of issues: this villanelle, for instance, projects the encounter not "as a unique, once-and-for-all event, but as something repeated, habitual, as a kind of Muybridgean cinematic sequence, a series of frames slightly differentiated from each other, where the repetition itself takes the woman away, confirms her in an otherness" (99). This sense of the poem as rendering something habitual corresponds with Albert Thibaudet's prescient celebration of this sonnet - anticipat- ing Walter Benjamin's take on it - as having become "consubstantiel à la poussière dorée du boulevard" ("part and parcel of the golden dust of the Parisian Boulevards"), so that male Parisians, as they stroll along eyeing the women who pass by and away forever, repeat the final alexandrine to themselves to savor their urban experience (22; my trans.). This villanelle may also better convey the sense of the theatricality of the street, down- playing the cliché of the romantic encounter that the sonnet form helps mythify, with its very irritating, deludedly narcissistic final clause, "ô toi que le savais!" Scott's fearless translation reads: Her motion elastic, her furbelows Stygian - Marooned on a refuge, by the din of the street, My whole self convulsed as she passed callipygian,3 Her figure as svelte as her cadence was Phrygian And legs statuesque and galbous and fleet. Her motion elastic, her furbelows Stygian, An hypnotic douceur and Salome's religion Were locked in her look which I drank till replete; My whole self convulsed as she passed callipygian, Her eyes full of storm and so hauntingly strygian.4 Was she grieving grande dame or a whore on her beat, Her motion elastic, her furbelows Stygian?</page><page sequence="7">JONATHAN CULLER III 97 And then she was gone, slick-fast as a widgeon,5 To beyond all beyond, to where none ever meet. My whole self convulsed as she passed callipygian, Too late, but she knew, this canny Parisian, That love at last sight puts the city on heat, Her motion elastic, her furbelows Stygian. My whole self convulsed as she passed callipygian. (97-98) This version highlights the linking in the Baudelairean canon of the widow and streetwalker, both of whom signal an emptiness: one of loss, the other of mutual degradation. The passante causes a rebirth in the poet that is not just a rekindling of sexual desire but also already nostalgia for imagined loss. This translation also reduces the "hollow amplitude" of Baudelaire's tenth and eleventh lines - "Ne te verrai-je plus que dans l'éternité?" - a grandiloquence that undermines the complex specificity and drama of the encounter (Scott 98-99). But this translation is a daring gamble, es- pecially since the Baudelairean rhymes, which include a rare rhyme-léonine , majestueuse-fastueuse , become in English the sequence stygian , callipy- gian , Phrygian , strygian , not to mention widgeon . In English, multisyllabic rhymes, especially when linked with dactyls, push verse toward doggerel. But Scott shrewdly notes that translation can capture the temporality of a text in a way interpretation cannot. Here the translation gives the taste of nineteenth-century doggerel, of Baudelaire's belief that a poet should know all the rare rhymes of his language, and of the modern fortunes of this text, with the Benjaminian "love at last sight" (101). At any rate, it is a bold inter- pretive gesture that captures readers' attention and provokes a reaction. Radical translations, conferring meaning on the original, strengthening some features, bringing others to prominence, encouraging a certain ir- reverence in the face of the original, can thus promote a good discussion.
