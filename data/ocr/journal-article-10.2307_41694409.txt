<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANANTAŠAYANA VISNU : EARLIEST EPIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE By A jay Mitra Shastri Vi§nu happens to be one of the most prominent brShmanical Hindu gods with numerous iconic manifestations and wide-spread artistic representa- tions to his credit. One of these forms shows him reclining on the body of the primeval serpent variously called Adi, Ananta or Še§a in the oceanic waters. It is therefore naturally popularly known as Ãdi-sayana, Ananta- šayana or Šesa-šayana1 in North India and RaňganStha or RañgasvSmin in South India. While in the North it is found represented only as a pariva- devatã or subsidiary divinity on the walls of the shrine, in South it often forms the principal cult object enshrined in the sanctum sanctorum ( garbha - grha ). However, its extant artistic representations date from a rather late period : in North not earlier than the fifth century A. D. and in South still later, and the general impression among art historians is that this form dates only from about the fifth-sixth centuries A. D. There is no doubt, however, that the concept underlying this icon goes back to a much earlier period, though it was not associated with Viçnu. It is actually a mythological elaboration of the Rgveda, X. 82. 5-6, wliere the ori- ginal principle, there called Višvakarman, is said to have been ' beyond the sky, beyond the earth, beyond the gods and spirits, the earliest embryo the waters contained wherein all the divinities resided.'^ In the Manu-smfti (I. 10 ) and the Mahãbhãrata ( XII. 341 ) a slightly altered version of the same myth is applied to PrajSpati. We are told that the waters were known as Näras as they were sons of Nara, and they were the abode of PrajSpati, he came to be known as NSrSyapa.3 The only thing that was required for regarding it as a form of Vispu was just to transfer this legend from Višva- karman I PrajSpati to god Vísqu after he came to be looked upon as the supreme god by his votaries and adjust it to the Vaiçnava mythology with a view to give it an iconic form. In the history of brãhmaçical mythology such a thing is not an unknown phenomenon and the well-known Vaiççava myth 1 Such images are also called Adi-sãyin, Ananta-sayin and Sesa-säyin in view of the semantic identity. 8 For the original quotation, see J.

Originally this myth also was associated with PrajSpati. The äatapatha-brähmana ( 14. 1.2) tells us that PrajSpati in the form of a boar raised the earth from the bottom of the ocean. The Tait tiri ya-Sranyaka represents the earth as having been rescued from the waters by a hundred-armed black boar. Only this function was transferred from PrajSpati, who was earlier regarded as the supreme divinity, to Visnu after the latter replaced him as the supreme god.4 And even the iconic form of Viççu as áesa-šayana must have come into existence much earlier, for the earliest extant images represent only a fully developed iconography. The only thing is that such sculptures of an earlier period have not yet been found. That such figures actually existed and enjoyed great popularity is clearly indicated by inscriptional references. There are vague allusions to this concept of Viççu in some inscriptions dating from the Gupta period. The Màndasor stone inscription of the time of the Aulikara chief Naravar- man dated Mãlava-Vikrama year 461 ( =404 A.D. ) commences with the salu- tation to the thousand-headed primeval god ( Puruça ) sleeping on the waters of the four oceans, s and the opening stanza of the Era# stone inscription of the time of the Gupta emperor Budhagupta and his subordinate Maharaja MStfvisnu dated Gupta year 165 ( = 484 A. D. ) hails the four-armed god Vi;pu having the waters of the four oceans for his bed.6 However, these allusions are quite vague and don't throw much light on the iconography of this form though they undoubtedly indicate the great popularity enjoyed by it during the whole of the fifth century A. D. But there is absolutely no reason for us to be disappointed in this matter, and the object of this write-up is to bring to the notice of scholars a couple of very pertinent but practically unnoticed epigraphical references vouching for the fully developed four-armed and eight-armed áe;a&lt;£ayana images during the third-fourth centuris A.

The earlier of the two references is encountered in the recently discovered BSgh plate7 of the Valkha Maharaja Bhulunda, dated year 47. 8 There is a controversy regarding the era in which the inscriptions of the Valkha chiefs are dated. V. V. Mirashi is inclined to refer these dates to the Kalachuri-Chedi era commencing in 248-49 A.D.,9 while the rest of the scholars who dealt with these inscriptions including K. V. Ramesh and S. P. Tewari,10 who are the latest to write on this problem, favour their refe- rence to the Gupta era beginning in 3D A. D. We are ourselves in favour of the latter view, and accordingly this record would have to be dated in Gupta year 47 or 367 A. D. If the view of Mirashi referring the dates of these inscrip- tions to the Kalachuri-Chedi era is to be conceded, this record would have to be dated over seven decades earlier still, i. e. 295-95 A. D. Thus according to the view of dating one might accept, this inscription will have to be assigned to the close of the third or latter half of the following century A. D. Now this plate purports to record the grant of five villages on the southern bank of the Narmada for the offering of bali and caru and maintaining a free feeding house ( satira ) in honour of god Visçu who is described in a very vivid manner, alluding to various aspects of his personality as then conceived.

Though the snake is not mentioned here specifically, it is apparently implied as it is a sine-qua-non of the reclining icon. Shorn of all eulogy, here the god is clearly called eight-armed ( asta-bãhuéãlin ) and described as carrying a conch shell ( sank ha ), arrow ( bana ), speai ( šakti ), wheel ( cakra ), the sword called Nandaka, mace ( gada ), and a lance ( itila ). These were evidently held in the seven hands, while the remaining eighth hand must have supported the head as we normally fiad in the Ananta-šayana images. This description would show that eight armed Šesa-Šayana images were al- ready well-known in Central India during the third-fourth centuries A. D. though no actual example answering this description dating from such an early age has been reported as yet. Chronologically the next allusion to this form comes from the recently discovered Mãndhal ( Kuhi tehsil, Nagpur district, Maharashtra) plates of the Väkätaka king Rudrasena II of the Nandi- vardhana branch dated in the fifth year of his reign, roughly about the close of the fourth century A.D. or a few years later.12 This reference is to a four- armed icon. At the very beginning of the record we are told that the grant registered in it was made at the behest or message ( sande&amp;a ) of the god MondasvSmin who is described as lying on the body of the snake king Ananta1* spread over the waters of the only o:ean (ekarnnava) in divine 11 Ramesh and Tewari, op. cit p. 1, lines 1-3. The whole passage is of enormous impor- tance for tracing the evolution of the concept of Visnu as it represents a fully developed god-head going under the name Visnu. In the subsequent portion of the passage we are introduced to various myths about the god as well as a few of his incarnations with their respective attainments described vividly. Vide ibid. p. 1, lines 3-5. 12 This record is not yet published in any English periodical orgwork. It has been edited by us jointly with Dr. Chandrashekhar Gupta in B. L. Bhole (ed.), Samsodhanãci K siti je (Dr. V. B. Kolte Platinum Jubilee Volume ), Nagpur, 1984, pp. 223-29. 13 The text at first sight gives the impression that the name of the snake-king ( nTfga rã ja ) as given here is Nanna, but it can as well be taken as Ananta as there is often a confusion between the letters t and « and taking the expression nãgarãjnonantasya together, it may be split up into nãçarãjtiah Anantasya. It is quite possible, however, that the intended reading was actually nãgarãjno Nannasya as it is found. But it would also not make any material difference in the meaning as Ananta is known to have been transformed into Nanna and as Nanna-Nãrãyana-bhattãraka he figures as the grantee of the Khalimpur plate of the Pala monarch Dharmapäla. Vide El, IV, p. 250, line 50 and p. 254, note 3. This would show that the name Ananta had been corrupted into Nanna as early as the close of the fourth / beginning of the follow« ing century A.

Students of early Indian history need not be told regarding the prevalence of the practice of naming an image or shrine after a personal or placc-narae, which continues even now. While names ending in Isa, Is vara or Šiva enjoyed popularity among the votaries of Šaivism, svä- w/n-cnding names were favoured by the Vaistjavas. And as Monda does not look like a personal name prevalent among the social elite as the founder or financier of a shrine may rightly be supposed to have been god Monda- svSmin, in all probability, nam:d after the place where the shrine in question was situated. It is pertinent to note in this context that there still exist villages called Maudä or Dongar Maudä near Mãijdhal, the findspot of the plates under reference. It would thus follow that the temple of Monda- svSmin was situated in this area. Let us hope that future explorations will enlighten us about its location. It is also worth noting in the present context that the excavations at MSgdhal carried out under the present writer's direc. tion have resulted in the discovery of a number of early Vaisçava sculptures.1' It may therefore be concluded that the region round MSndhal was an impor« tant centre of BhSgavatism during the early VSkãtaka period. It is equally interesting that Rudrasena II, the donor of these plates, alone among the early members of the dynasty was a devout worshipper of god Vi$Qu, and it is averred in our record as well as in the later official records of the family that his authority was established by the wheel-bearing god i. e. Vispu.18 We may note that the god Ananta-šayana Viçnu is also described in the present epigraph as bearing, inter alia, a wheel. It is very likely, therefore, that he played a pivotal role in popularising the BhSgavata religion in this region. The inscription states that the land earlier granted to the two mona- steries of the SStvata school originally belonged to Vatsagulma ( modern 14 Vide Ajay Mitra Shastri and Chandrashekhar Gupta, op. cit., p. 22. 11 They include Visnu and Balar ä ma killing the demon Dhenuka. Vide Ajay Mitra ~ Shastri, "Mánchala Utkhanana" (Hindi), Vldarbha Samsodhana Mandala Vdrsika, 1977," pp. 142 ff. 16 The passage in our record runs as bhagavatas = cakra-laksma-pratisthita- iSsattasya (line 11 ), while in subsequent records of the family it is changed slightly into bhagavatas = cakra -früne'i pras~ul-op~irjita~krï-sam uäayasya.</page><page sequence="6">116 Annals BORI , LXXV ( 1994 ) Basim, Akola district, Maharashtra).17 It means that the land granted ear- lier was in the vicinity of the village ( AragrSmaka ) later given away through the charter under reference. It can be easily inferred that the Sätvata mona- steries played an important role in the propagation and popularization of Bhägavatism in the region In ancient India there raged a great controversy with regard to the Vedic or non-Vedic character of the SStvatas. Some of the Vaisnava Agama texts are at great pains to prove their affiliation to the Vedas and establish their relationship with some Veda. Manu's statement that Sãtvatas were a mixed caste born from a Vaišya- Vratya18 placed the Pañcaratra ãcãrya* s in a very awkward position which they tried to remedy with great vigour. YãmunScãrya, the uncle of the celebrated Vaisgava ãcãrya Rämänuja, in his well-known work Agama - prãmãnya 19 makes great efforts to prove that they were actually one of the best brShmana communities. According to him, they were the best of the twice-born ( i. e. brãhmaças ) and worshippers of Bhagavat ( Vispa ) and called Sätvatas because of their devotion to the Lord with all the vitality ( sattva).*0 This derivation of Sãítvata is also met with in ParSsara's com- mentary on the Visnu- sahasra-nãma : we are told that sat denotes brahma truth, and people endowed with it are known as Sätvat ; alternatively they are so called as they practised and preached the spiritual knowledge ( brahma- vidyã ) and the code of conduct and the texts ( kar ma-š astra ) prescribed by 17 The original has Vãtsagulmakasya Sãtvata-carnn-ãdhivãsa-dvayasya which, if taken literally, would mean that the two monasteries were situated at Vatsagulma itself. But since the granter belonged to the Nandivardhana branch, Vatsagulma was the capital of another branch of the dynasty that started ruling independently after Pravarasena I and the temple of Mondasvämin, at whose instance the grant was reportedly made, appears to have been situated near Mãndhal, these two monas- teries must also have been located in the same region. In view of this fact, the expre- ssion Vãtsagulmakasya seems to be intended as an adjective of Sãtvata-carana and not of the entire compound Sãtvata-caran-ãdhivãsa-dvayasya , used in the sense of one originally belonging to and hailing from Vatsagulma. Instances of such sãpeksa-samãsa are often met with in inscriptions. However, if the expression is taken in its apparent sense, we shall have to believe that the grant was made in favour of the monasteries situated at Vatsagul.na itself. The phrase beginning with the word Sãtvata may also allude to two temples of Sätvata, viz. Väsudeva-Krsna, with his footprints installed in them at Vatsagulma. However, the first interpretation is pre- ferable and more convincing.

In his another work, KášmlrSgama, YSmunScSrya tried to establish the non-human character ( apauruseyatva ) of the Ekãyana-iõkhã and referred to this discussion in his Âgama-prãmãnya as well.' 3 The association of the EkSyana-š&amp;khS and the Sättvatas is well-known among the PäncarStra and is referred to in a number of Vaisnava texts including the livara-samhitS which mentions Sankarçjça ( BalarSma ) as a teacher of the Ekñyana- veda.2i The Jayãkhya-samhitã, a well-known PSScarStra text assigned generally to the Gupta period, also discusses at length about the K3gva^ Ekãyana-sãkliS of the Yajurveda and the PSñcarStrikas. In short, the Sättvatas are regarded as the brahmanes belonging to the Ekäyana recension ( íãkhã ) of the Vâjasaneya school of the Yajurveda .3 ' These texts, however* belong to a much later period. Our inscription shows that not only the brähmanahood and the Vedic character of the Sättvatas was upheld in their own circles but that their Vedic association was taken for granted in the Dec- can much earlier ( closc of the fourth century A. D. ) as clearly indicated by the specific reference to their carana ( Vedic school ). And as the two monas« teries of the Sättvatas mentioned in our record were situated in the MSçdhal region, this area was undoubtedly an important centre of their activities. And since these Sãttvacas hailed originally from Vatsagulma or Basim in the Akola district of Maharashtra, the Vatsagulma region also must have been an important stronghold of the school. Thus, during the reign of the VSkafaka king Rudrasena II the whole of Vidarbha buzzed with the activities of the Sättvatas who must have played a vital role in the propagation of the Pañca- rStra ideology including the Ananta-šayana form of god Viçpu which must 21 Sat brahtna satyam vã, tad=vantah sa tv ant ah, Brahmavidyã sãtvikã t&gt;3 tesãm^idam karma sãstram vã sãtvatam, tat kurvãnãs=tad=ãcak^nnãsí=a ca vã. 22 Caksur=visphãrana-samanantaram sikhã-yajnopavita-pãlãsa-danda-maunjim yujo dvija-kumãrãn pasyanto brahmanTi ity-avagacchanti ih a vã kim-ahar «■ ahar=adhty amana- Vãjasaneyak-Aikãyana-sãkhãn vilasad=upavìt-auttart - ya-sikhã-sãlino-dhyãpayataht Agama-prãmãnya , pp. 69-70. *3 Ekãyana-sãkhãya apauruseyatvam tatha Kãsmirãgama-pramãnye prastUyate .

As the grant is stated to have bien made at the behest of god Monda- svãmin who, as we have seen, was actually Ananta-šayana Visnu, it is very likely that the benefactor, Vãkãtaka king Rudrasena II, was a devout worship- per of this form. It is generally believed that the snake-reclining images of Visnu * did not acquire a very important place in Visnu's iconography 916 and though known from an early period and continuing to exist in the later period, it ' never acquired a position to deserve many shrines dedicated to him.'-7 Our allusions cited above are quite important from this point of view also. While the allusion in the Bägh plate of Bhulunda only indicates the presence of a Vi§nu temple of any description as he is described in various forms and incarnations,' 8 there can be no doubt whatever that the Mondasvãmin known from the Mãndhal plates of the Vãkãtaka monarch Rudrasena II was actually an Ananta-šayana image installed in the sanctum sanctorum and the temple was dedicated to him. It is interesting to note in this connection that most of the extant Ananta-šayana images of Visna are found carved in the niches of shrines and we are not aware of any independent shrine put up especially in his honour.21 Mondasvãmin temple was such a rarity. The two inscriptions are also important for the iconography of the Snake-reel icting form of Visnu. They refer to eight- and four-armed images in a strictly chronological order. It must be pointed out here that the literary texts describing iconographie features of this form are quite late and our records provide the earliest datable account of its iconography. While thé Bägh plate is silent on the point, the Mändhal plates describe Mondasvãmin as sleeping on the body of Aninta in the divine slumber ( yoga-nidrã ). According to South Indian iconographie texts, the reclining images of Visiju fall into four classes, viz, yoga # bhoga, víra and abhicãra.

Here the god is reclining on the body of Ananta and is four-armed with his head resting on the upper left hand, the left lower flexed and kept on the folds of Ananta, the lower right arm placed on the slightly raised right knee and the upper right touching the canopy of snake-hoods.

Here three of the attributes ( ãyudhas ), viz. šaňkha, cakra and asi, mentioned in the MSndhal plates in the description of four-armed Ananta-šayana figures, are depicted in an anthropomorphic form and not actually held by the god, while the fourth is conspicuous by its absence in the description because the com- poser of the record conceived an image where th; attributes were actually held in his hands and not anthropomorphically represented, and one of the hands supporting his head.
