For that matter, Pythagoras or Muriel Rukeyser?1 The contemporary American dichotomy of lib eral and conservative does not do justice to the complexities of many a past writer and ph?osopher. Anachronism as weU as binary thinking befud dle the mass of criticism on Shakespeare that has largely ruled him political ly conservative?or neutral and invisible. A twentieth-century version of this ruling runs roughly from E. M.W.TiUyard to Blair Worden. For the former, Ulysses's speech in praise of degree or hierarchy and order in Troilus and Cressida expresses what aU Elizabethans?including Shakespeare?would have taken for granted (1943, 9-17). For Worden, a knowledge of Renaissance politics cannot "take us to the heart" of Shakespeare's plays for "aU we have on the page are speeches which conform to the characteriza tions of their speakers" (1992, 1,2). Shakespeare in such readings comes off as basicaUy a conservative or pro-monarchist or as one who did not need to weigh in politicaUy to write as poet and/or playwright. Yet what if the political relation of poetry and drama to governance was at the core of his view of his own function as a writer, as Annabel Patterson (1989, 6), Jean Howard (1994, 17-21), Constance Jordan (1997, 29-33), Laurie Shannon (2002, 7-8) and Hugh Grady (2002, 20-21) have recently contended? It is arguable that to some degree, Shakespeare saw himself as an unacknowledged legislator, an Orpheus for aU humankind at the "Global" center of an unrealized public order or republic, as Pauline Kiernan has indeed argued (1996, 14-20). According to classical myth, Orpheus was the first creator of civil society for a w?d humanity which was tamed by the poet's music. This foundational act represents a republican moment at the very beginning ofWestern literature, inviting aU to partake in a commonweal or polity as they flock to hear the bard's song. Shakespeare recognizes this transformative power of Orphic music in The Merchant of Venice when he has Lorenzo both invoke the myth and strip it of pretensions to being an instru ment of a long-lasting harmony An unspecified "poet," Lorenzo teUs his beloved Jessica, Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods; Since nought so stockfish, hard, and full of rage, But music for the time doth change his nature. The myth is a political and moral litmus-test, Lorenzo further observes, for a man,</page><page sequence="3">198 College Literature 34.1 [Winter 2007] not moved with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils. (Merchant of Venice, 5.1. 79-85)2 What if Shakespeare too designed his art to convert or seduce his Globe's audience "for the time," eliciting a harmony among humankind, intimating a wide-ranging wisdom regarding how people can relate civiUy in personal and public ways, marrying and forming cities, for example, to cite the vatic, or divinely prophetic, powers attributed to Orpheus (and Amphion) by the Roman poet Horace in his Art of Poetry? What if the poet-playwright's mis sion was to evoke and cast suspicion upon a universal law of nations, the way the myth of Orpheus begins in a comedy uniting humanity and ends in tragedy, with the bard UteraUy torn apart by his own foUowers become "stockfish, hard, and fuU of rage" again? In his works, Shakespeare takes up the fuUest range of issues like an Orpheus playing an advisory role to aU on how to be civilized. His drama and poetry range from personal matters of love to political themes regarding how empires, nations, cities, fam?ies and friendships are gained, governed, or lost. It is within this theoretical mission as a fuUy engaged artist understood in the most ancient, nearly vatic sense of it, addressing public issues on the largest scale, that we can situate the work of an important recent interna tional trio of books on Shakespeare as a republican in some direct or implic it way. The Irishman Hadfield, Scotsman Maley, and, to a lesser degree, the American Cheney aU agree that throughout his career Shakespeare was a humanist writer committed to the civic virtue of literature and was pro foundly political, leaning towards a republican position with libertarian or counter-national implications. The two volumes of the important anthology Republicanism also included in this review offer readers an important early modern European context in which to place any supposed repubUcanism on Shakespeare's part. First one must acknowledge, as Worden (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002, 1.307-09) andVittor Ivo Comparato (1.177) convincingly emphasize, the notorious difficulty facing us with the term "repubUcanism." On the other hand, the standard meaning of what a republic is, is fairly lucid if we consider that Cicero, both a Roman orator and statesman, in numerous of his works, and the most controversial, most important political theorist of the sixteenth century, MachiaveUi, in his Discourses on Livy, understood a repub lican government as a poUticaUy sovereign body ruling without a monarch. This is why republican discourse exists mostly behind a veil of innuendoes in Shakespeare's day in opposition to early-modern despotism, as Eluggero Pii observes (2.250).Yet republics also existed in the fuU light of day.To take</page><page sequence="4">Anthony DiMatteo 199 seven conspicuous examples explored in some depth by the two-volume study,Venice, Genoa, Geneva, Antwerp, Bruges, Aragon, and Poland were aU described in Shakespeare's lifetime as self-governing repubHcs. Of course, throughout the period, the classical city-states of Sparta and Athens as weU as Republican Rome were most active as long-lived examples of kingless gov ernments, as the many references to these classical examples in the two-vol ume coUective show. Indeed, the study affords us access to a wealth of usages by Shakespeare's contemporaries. In 1612, for example, Lodovico GuicciarcHni in his description of the Netherlands described Antwerp as gov erning herself from ancient times "almost in the way of a free city and repub lic" though under the official present rule of the Duke of Brabant "as her lord and prince" (qtd. in 1.110 [T?mans]). A popular CastiHan dictionary of 1611 defines rep?blica as libera civitas, status liberae civitatis, that is, a free city, or the state of free cities (1.264 [G?]). In 1569, Lithuanian deputies arriving for the Polish Seym or parliament were assigned a weighty legal phrase that popes routinely used to describe their own power, cum plena potestate, that is, with fuU power (1.154 [OpaHnski]).A 1566 treatise draws on imperial Roman law to describe the liberty of the city republics of the Netherlands as if they held imperium in regno suo, that is, complete sovereignty in their own space (1.121 22 [T?mans]). Even London was described as governed "by the citizens, almost as a republic" by the Italian historian and political ph?osopher Giovanni Botero in 1597 (1.263 [G?]). This history and usage of the word "republicanism" placed those who supported some version of it at the far end of the early-modern political spectrum from those who beHeved, as did Henry VIII and, expHcitly James I, that a monarch held an absolute power in a supreme office divinely institut ed rather than historicaUy awarded and/or constitutionaUy limited. In typi cal republican theory, the sovereign power of the king was not of divine ori gin but was a gift or entrustment from the coUective people. Rather than by divine decree, the king ruled by the lex regia, or the set of laws pertaining to the king alone as codified in Roman law, which originated in a mysterious consent of the many to an appointment of the best of men as ruler for the sake of the res publica or the common good. This rooting of kingship in the people's consent was recognized by the Roman historian Tacitus whose works were first translated into English in the last decade of Queen Elizabeth's reign and were being avidly read in London, Cambridge, and Oxford. This consensual view of the royal prerogative was also held by John Fortescue, Thomas Smith, Fran?ois Hotman, and Juan de Mariana, to name four important early-modern writers of humanist and republicanist incHna tions brought into focus by the two-volume study. Indeed, various early modern groups attempting to resist the imperial claims of kings made tacti</page><page sequence="5">200 College Literature 34.1 [Winter 2007] cal use of such writings. FoUowing Mariana's stricture regarding the king's need to rule by consent, for example, Irish agents argued against James Is levying of fines against Catholics "since the king does not coUect any subsidy without the decree of the senate, and the free consent of the entire Republic of the kingdom" (qtd. in CarroU 2001, 115). Obviously, those who believed in the vaUdity of a repubUcan rule of government were not automaticaUy against ideas of a lordship or dominion of some men over other men and men over women, but, on the other hand, they stressed how any just domin ion of the few over the many requires recognition of and respect for natural rights of individuals. One could accordingly believe in an aristocratic repub lic or even a monarchical republic or, more typicaUy in the Uterature, a mixed republic, regimen mixtum, as the monarchomachs favored (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002,1.207), or a "composite monarchy," to use J. H. EUiott's mod ern term for the early-modern governments of England and Spain (Cervantes 2006, 3; CoUinson, 2003). On the other hand, it is important that we moderns take note of a chief feature of the early-modern period: belief in a republic did not involve advo cating a democracy, a form of government denounced since the time of Plato. Despite republican theorists' traditional opposition to what the most important French political ph?osopher of the sixteenth century, Jean Bodin, described in terms of pure monarchy or merum imperium, the early-modern idea of a republic was not thought of as a rule of aU by aU. Indeed, as Hadfield and Maley make very clear, we readers of early-mod ern literature need to learn how to listen for the republican accent of strug gles and conflicts often registered obliquely in the poetry and drama of the period. Maley reminds us, from the perspective of his study of the "British problem" reflected in?and shaped by?Shakespeare, how a republic differs from and connects with the terms "nation," "state," "kingdom," and "empire." Wh?e at least three of these words might ring synonymously to modern ears, in Shakespeare's day, as aU five books amply demonstrate, each of the terms was a flashpoint in an endless political debate and struggle about the nature and practices of sovereignty, about who had it, what mixed or pure form it could take, and what it aUowed and obUged one to do as a people or a soci ety?or a writer. Throughout its history, there is a "striking lability" or open ness to change in the meanings of the term "republican," as J. K. Wright remarks (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002,1.290), reflecting on Bodin and his titular use of the word. A vogue for his Six Books of the Republic first pub lished in 1576 soon swept throughout the courts and universities of Europe in the author's Latin and French versions. Bodin notoriously tries to recon cile the radical problems of early-modern sovereignty by grounding them in the royal prerogative of the king. His conceptual complexity is not stressed</page><page sequence="6">Anthony DiMatteo 201 enough in modern accounts, showing a subtlety and ambivalence sim?ar to Shakespeare's shrewd characterization of Henry V. Attempting to bridge medieval and early-modern legal divides, the figure of Bodin s king has an absolute legitimacy that derives from an accord of a repubUc's greatest fami lies if not from God himself. In this way, "repubUcanism" is mysteriously rec oncilable with absolute monarchy (Franklin 1973,102-13; Pennington 1993, 276-88). How pUant the word appears indeed! No wonder that in his study of early-modern Scottish Republicanism, Marco Geuna doubts "whether it is appropriate to talk in terms of one single tradition of repubUcan thought" (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002,2.190). Indeed, even today one can still dis cover conflicting new forms of republicanism sprouting along aUegedly ancient Roman pathways. At one end of the political spectrum we find Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri arguing in favor of a "postmodern repub licanism" that "w?l have to be constructed au milieu, on the basis of the lived experience of the global multitude" (2001, 210). In contrast to this post modern, humanist understanding of repubUcanism is the U.S. evangelical version or appropriation of it. Harvard economists Edward Glaeser and Bryce Ward have recently argued that this current version represents a notable departure from longstanding traditions of republicanism formerly associated in the United States with mainline Protestantism and the wealthy (2006,33). The best form of repubUcanism, it seems to this writer, be it in early modern or current times, continues to raise profound questions about the power of authority figures and how that form does or does not contribute to the common good. Of those who would govern, it boldly asks the ques tion that Cicero posed to Caesar and Marc Antony and that the English "Democratical Gentlemen" directed to Charles I in 1642: "Do you caU servi tude peace?" (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002 2.10-11 [Skinner]). And at times, out of honest respect for what the ancient Roman Law of the Twelve Tables identified as "the supreme law, the health of the people" (2.18), true republicanism is even able to admit to confusion and discontinuity, as when Representative Steve Largent asked a confounding question of his congres sional coUeagues: "What does the party of Lincoln and Reagan stand for?" (Berke 1999). Far more perplexing would be an updated version of Largent's query: What does the republicanism of Lincoln have to do with that of George W Bush? Clearly, theories pivoting on some recognizable or odd notion of repub Ucanism w?l continue to rise and faU away, as the coUection of Skinner and van Gelderen shows. On the other hand, the volumes also demonstrate that liberty, rule by law, and civ? virtue, in historical contradistinction to the pre rogatives and power of greatness and dominion, are the traditional core val</page><page sequence="7">202 College Literature 34.1 [Winter 2007] ues of repubHcanism (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002 1.176 [Comparato], 2.29 [Armitage], 2.194 [Geuna]; 1950 [Wirszubski]). The early-modern terminological field of contention pitted the idea of a republican, citizen, or native with fuU natural legal rights against that of a royal subject with Hmited rights contingent upon a king's prerogative or rea son of state. Maley s book deftly demonstrates some of the ways this struggle had come to play out for England, Ireland, and Scotland in Shakespeare's day. It aUows us to realize how notions of the nation, kingdom, republic, state and empire lined up or coUided in the experiences and identities of Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, Francis Bacon, John Ford, and John Milton as weU as the living multitude we seem to catch a glimpse of through their works. Maley, like Hadfield, sees his work as one of intervention. "The paradox at the heart of this book," Maley writes, "is that the precarious Britishness out of which these founding figures forge their colonial visions has been obscured by the emphasis, in literary criticism, on the supposedly pecuHarly English culture to which they contributed" (2003,3). Maley is most adept at identifying the different facets of this paradox. Of the Tudor and Jacobean line of power in England, Maley observes: "A state forged in Wales and subsequently fitted with parts in Scotland before being exported to Ireland had an obvious blue print. Britain was made in Rome" (32). Uncovering such conflicting layers of early-modern political identity, Maley alerts us to how we are to under stand a deep irony to the question of Macmorriss, an Irish soldier fighting an English war in France, who bitterly asks in Shakespeare's Henry V, "What ish my nation?" Indeed, as Maley observes, if we regard the historical circum stances of the Irish?or actuaUy the British?crisis raging during the time of the play's writing, "Ireland is the battlefield in Henry V9 (20). Maley s identi fication of the stress points caused by English colonialism on English soil in Shakespeare's day encourages readers to give fuU interpretive consideration to what we can call libertarian or counter-imperial moments in Shakespeare's works. His three chapters on Shakespeare (Shakespeare and the British Problem; Postcolonial Cymbeline; and Shakespeare, Holinshed and Ireland) explore the centuries-long irony of how Shakespeare has often been "enlisted in the service of a conservative English nationalism" while "the bard was preoccupied with putting the problems of state onto the stage." Shakespeare warrants reading as "the critique of a multinational state" rather than as "a contribution to the making of a national literature" (9). Maley s book has provocative impHcations for how we read aU of EngHsh literature: "The canon, being English, tends to gloss over other national identities, as weU as eliding the differences between nationalists, unionists, and republi cans" (29). In his exceUent chapter on Cymbeline, he shows how the com</page><page sequence="8">Anthony DiMatteo 203 plexity of the play "stems in part from its multilayered treatment of the prob lem of British origins and the troubled issues of union and empire" (33). Maley teaches his readers how to separate out the strands of different political positions at war in Shakespeare and his culture. In view of his book, I can now, for example, understand how Imogen's Hamlet-like invocation of the unacknowledged brotherhood of aU people applies to different aspects of Shakespeare's works early and late: "clay and clay differs in dignity, / Whose dust is both alike" (Cymbeline 4.2.4-5). A republican stress upon natural equi ty as against the prerogatives of greatness or empire rings out in such Stoical moments that envision a natural feUowship of humankind. Likewise, in his chapter on Edmund Spenser's View of the Present State of Ireland which he caUs his book's "turning point" (2003, 4), Maley makes us hear afresh the repub lican, stoical accents of the main speaker Irenius, Spenser's supposed spokesman in the dialogue, who observes, quite radicaUy given English pride in a "purity of origins" over the Irish and the Spanish, how "there is no nation now in Christendome, nor much further, but is mingled, and com pounded with others" (88). To eke out republican sentiments for the people's natural rights and duties in Shakespeare and his age often requires us to connect the dots of many of his stories and phrasings that he himself arguably dared not flesh out. Hadfield, whom Maley hails a feUow "Roman" in the epigraph to his own book, observes that the history of "early repubUcanism in England" is "dis continuous and fragmentary" (2003, 231). Yet, as Johnson Kent Wright observes for Old Regime France, so too for Shakespeare's England: a histo ry of the origins of republicanism "would have to start in the sixteenth cen tury, when opposition to Absolutism [the claim by kings to have autonomous legislative power] in the epoch of its construction already appealed to civic humanist themes" (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002, 1.290). Charting the course of such opposition in both late sixteenth-century England (part one of his book) and in Shakespeare (part two), Hadfield identifies the terms of a "lively inteUectual debate" (2005, 50) in the 1590s that formed a "republi can moment" featuring the merging of Roman and EngUsh history (28) and that heavily influenced Shakespeare in his formative years as a poet and dramatist. Indeed, corroborating Hadfield's argument, Markku Peltonen quotes a teUing instance of this (con)fusion of things Roman and English from an English treatise of 1601: the queen was "so absolute a Soueraigne, and so soueraigne an Empresse" that she "truly meriteth the due title of Cesar" (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002,1.85). A late-Elizabethan climate of struggle, crisis, and secrecy was strongly motivated by the failing health of the queen and the absence of a clear successor to the throne as Hadfield stresses (2005, 107). In contrast to such mortality was the legacy of the queen's</page><page sequence="9">204 College Literature 34.1 [Winter 2007] ascribed absolutist pretensions and caesarism that was to prove so disastrous to the Stuart monarchs who foUowed in her wake. Looking past and at such imperial vanity and power that stood in stark contrast to the aging body of his queen, Shakespeare, more than any other contemporary playwright, explored higher?and deeper?grounds of gover nance. As Hadfield observes, he was "especiaUy interested in how political institutions functioned, who they represented, and how individuals came to occupy offices of state" (2005, 53). He finds a humanist republican emphasis on civic virtue and duty?as weU as resistance to tyranny?a persistent con cern in many of Shakespeare's plays and poems. For Shakespeare, "the repub lic was always an ideal that was in the process of becoming or receding" (168). Above aU a hater of tyranny, the early Shakespeare for Hadfield is the "English Lucan" (106). Lucan, the Roman poet and nephew of the Stoic ph?osopher Seneca, wrote his epic poem The Civil War in studied opposition to Virg?'s Aeneid by portraying Julius Caesar as a tyrant and supporting "a broader or antimonarchical politics" (Quint 1993, 8). Hadfield argues that throughout his career, Shakespeare understood his own literature as an "espe ciaUy important form for advancing political debate," preserving or forging a relatively free imaginative space necessar?y protected in a despotic age by ambiguous veils of his own making, his uncanny way of shrewdly taking into account what the censorious magistracy would aUow (2005, 7). In the five chapters of part two, Hadfield densely explores this ability of Shakespeare to take on the burning political issues of the 1590s and weigh in implicitly on a republican side. Chapters on Shakespeare's English version of Lucan s Roman civil war (the three Henry VI plays and Richard HI), Venus and Lucr?ce, Titus Andronicus, Julius Caesar, and "the radical Hamlet" reveal Shakespeare's preoccupation with republican stories. The story of the ban ishment of KingTarquin, for example, that led to the founding of the Roman Republic, "appears time and again throughout Shakespeare's career" (2005, 187). Hadfield explores how Hamlet resembles the liberator Lucius Junius Brutus who, according to the Roman historian Livy feigned madness dur ing the time of Tarquin's tyranny and who led the vengeance against the matron Lucrece's outrage by stirring the Roman populace to exile the King and his rapist son. This Hamlet-Brutus connection is "only one of the com plex republican contexts and themes that this messiest of plays signals and develops" (191). Strengthening the whole book, Hadfield constantly keeps in mind his opening query regarding the complex reasons that Shakespeare's republican ism has dropped out of critical view for centuries. Its recovery involves Hadfield in a careful reading and analysis of patterns of meaning and aUu sions that he convincingly delivers in this richly documented book.</page><page sequence="10">Anthony DiMatteo 205 Cheney too finds Shakespeare deploying a symbolic code but as a way to engage in a contemporary literary rivalry, playing off republican Marlowe and his Ubertine Ovid against nationaUst Spenser and his imperial Virg?. Cheney depicts Shakespeare in a counter-imperial, counter-national role. The bard puts to work the course and range of Ovid's poetry to bu?d a lit erary career on page and stage in shadowy critique of aU imperial preten sions. He repeatedly situates nations and states in a metamorphic process of growth and decay. In this way, Shakespeare charts out a ground for himself as an Ovidian poet-playwright, a new form of authorship invented by Marlowe to rebut Spenser's VirgiUanism. Reflecting on the work of Annabel Patterson, Richard Helgerson, Jonathan DoUimore and Hadfield, Cheney importantly demonstrates that "the complex dialogic presence of both Spenser and Marlowe as mighty opposites in Shakespeare's art may help account for the debate about the poUtical working of his poems and plays" (2004, 47, note 41). Shakespeare forges a new path to having a professional literary career by making "poetry and theater ... an inteUectual dyad vital to his signature as an author" (28), with the "conjunction" of the two the "central form of his art" (236). Cheney convincingly maintains and explores this intertwining of poetry and drama throughout the four parts of the book that focuses on the published poems against the background of an evolving drama or "play scene." There are chapters on Venus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucr?ce, The Passionate Pilgrim, "The Phoenix and the Turtle" and The Sonnets as weU as two most stimulating opening chapters comparing the peculiar contours of Shakespearean authorship to that of Cervantes and Petrarch. Cheney promises a second volume that wiU invert the present study, as it were, foregrounding the plays against the background of the poems. Indeed, the most interesting analyses to this reader of the current work were those that began to explore the many Shakespearean dramatic and poetic characters that "resemble the authorial poet-playwright himself" (2004, 34). The Winter's Tale's Autolycus, for example, shares with his maker "careers of creation and crime" (274). HopefuUy Cheney's next book wiU bring to the fore what is interestingly observed but not fuUy developed in this one, name ly, the political function of Shakespeare's union of poetry and theater. Cheney finds this function strikingly figured at the end of The Rape of Lucr?ce when the people march "thorough Rome" with the dead body of Lucr?ce, mak ing it the visible proof, as it were, of why kingship had to be banished and a republic formed. Cheney tantaUzingly observes, "The author weds poetry and theatre to create a new hybrid form of repubUcan aesthetics" (142). What is this hybridity? How does it connect to what Cheney identifies in his read ing of sonnet 15 as "the West's most enduring problem, the tragic fact of human mortality" (220)? Now that Hadfield has unearthed the republican</page><page sequence="11">206 College Literature 34.1[Winter 2007] aspect of Shakespeare's purposes, much more can be?and need be?speUed out and explored. How might Cheneys reading of "The Phoenix and the Turtle" apply to aU of Shakespeare's work to lesser and greater degrees, requir ing readers to understand "both the poHtical and Hterary at once" (176)? The shape of Shakespeare's politicized aesthetics emerges more clearly if we keep Maley's "British problem" in mind. It is a formative background to Shakespeare's career/s, intertextual typologies, and genre-wars that Cheney is so adept at identifying. Cheney's literary inquiry into the form England's national poet was to take (2004, 41) must open up to the broad er horizon of Maley s question: what form was the English nation taking in Shakespeare's day? The critical differences of these three books emerge more clearly if we look at the way they treat a seminal classical figure of the poet recurring in early-modern English Hterature. Cheney's Orpheus, for example, is different than Maley s or Hadfield's. He is the central archetype of the poet's career for Cheney. The generic turn impHcit in Orpheus's legend from epic to elegy, from shepherd of the people to complaining, metamorphosed lover "narra tivizes the principle ofVirgilian attenuation" that, in the hands of Ovid and Marlowe, is "scripted to oppose imperial nationaHsm" (2004,95-97). Cheney argues that this counter-Virgilian, counter-Spenserian dynamic is crucial to understanding the course of Shakespeare's career and literary output as counter-national. Here is where Cheney's work would most fruitfuUy inter sect with Hadfield's and Maley's. However, Cheney, cruciaUy and teUingly does not speU out where this position would leave Shakespeare in terms of possibly radical or republican poHtical aUegiances. Representative of Maley's more tactical, less strategic approach is the way he reads Francis Bacon's use of the myth of Orpheus in his compeUing chap ter on Bacon's Certain Considerations Touching the Plantation in Ireland. Maley points out how Bacon puts aside his typical distrust of the poetic imagina tion when he writes to James I enjoining him to "join the harp of David .. . with the harp of Orpheus, in casting out desolation and barbarism" (2003, 102). Maley adroitly demystifies Bacon's claim to speak for ancient wisdom: "In addressing the related projects of [British] union and plantation, Bacon can be seen to be wrestling with a reconciliation of the poetic and the politic" (103). Bringing to the fore such agonistic problems is the principle goal of Maley s approach, counteracting the centuries-long tendency in lit erary studies that naively equates English and British literature. In contrast but not disagreement, Hadfield takes a more dialectical approach to early-modern deployments of the myth (to stick to our Orpheus example).To quote from an earlier work by Hadfield on Spenser, The Faerie Queene arguably served "an Orphic function in its ab?ity to transform the</page><page sequence="12">Anthony DiMatteo 207 w?derness left by the natives that it is at once congruent with a political authority and simultaneously aware of a potential to undermine what it ostensibly relies upon" (1997, 4-5). This dialectical view of an Orphic Spenser obviously caUs into question Cheney's more monarchical than republican view of the "New Poet" Spenser. There is an important issue hanging in the balance here if we take aU three approaches into considera tion. FoUowing Virgil and Ovid's famous examples, Bacon, Spenser, Shakespeare and Marlowe aU arguably apply the Orpheus myth to direct attention not only to how their own careers can be won or lost but how whole nations or cultures can rise and faU, the way the arch-civilizing Orpheus was kUled as a result of the very Dionysian rituals that he had helped to institute. Thus, "the streams of Helicon" representing learning or philosophy in general can dry up in one nation and "show its head ... in some other nation," as Bacon says in The Wisdom of the Ancients (1857, Chapter 11, n.p.). Though often presenting himself that way, Bacon was not alone in such humanist aUegorical reading. The process of metamorphosis applied to nations was indeed claimed as a principle tenet of Orpheus s song by the German scholar Georgius Sabinus in his introduction to his 1589 commen tary on Ovid, one of the most popular handbooks on Ovid in the sixteenth century. Orpheus in his song on the Argo "made manifest an ancient poetic doctrine on the course of time itself, the history of the world, and the muta tion of things as it applies to kingdoms" (1589, 2r; my translation, ).The lit erary career of these early-modern authors, then, if they are to be seen as Orphic as Cheney has argued over the course of three thick books now, thus can be fruitfully understood to mime somehow the state or fate of entire nations rather than just the narrow generic and careerist aspirations of the authors themselves. Thus, for example, if, as Cheney convincingly argues, Shakespeare's Lucr?ce "emerges as a Ph?omela figure associated with Orphic power" (2004,130), we have a more striking answer to Cheney's own ques tion than the one he provides: "What ... is a painting of Troy's faU doing in Lucrece's house?" (136). Cheney argues that "in the end epic art fails as sadly as does other genres," with Spenser's Virgilian ideal of empire fa?ing to con sole Lucr?ce and aU art unable to "supply the purgation and consolation for life's traumatic sadness" (136). But there is also, arguably, a deeper layer of symbolic implication. Lucrece's tragic rape and suicide, like Orpheus s mur der in Bacon's reading, signal the death and birth of forms of civilizations, in this case, the momentous transition in Roman civ?ization from Tarquinian monarchy to free repubUc. By implication, then, the power of Lucrece's maker, the poet-playwright Shakespeare, is registered in terms of its Orphic ab?ity to teU stories of the rise and faU of governments. There are indeed</page><page sequence="13">208 College Literature 34.1 [Winter 2007] republican implications here that Hadfield speUs out in his chapter on The Rape of Lucr?ce and Venus and Adonis, arguing for a tactical?and republican ist?intervention on Shakespeare's part into late-EHzabethan poHtics. He observes, "Elizabeth's argument that if Mary [Queen of Scots] were execut ed, the conduct of other monarchs might be subject to hostile scrutiny would appear to be fulfiUed in Shakespeare's two poems," in which the lusts of those who would be "absolute" monarchs, such as Prince Tarquin and Venus, stands in sharp contrast to the republican virtues of Lucr?ce and Adonis, who both stress the need for consent (146). Along this fault-line of the sinful impermanence and vulnerab?ity of monarchs?for whom, chronicaUy Majesty and Love cannot be brought to bed as Ovid says?Maley's work charts a particularly compeUing course for the direction and function of Shakespearean poetry and drama. Shakespeare as the nomadic bard of an imaginary Britain performs and sings of the false aura of English kings, how royal spectacle tries to cover over the legalized violence that kings inflict or, rather, are aUowed to inflict. The crown's attempt in Shakespeare's day to create by m?itary force and expedition a British culture for Ireland, Scotland and England as weU as Virginia involved the London Crown in a massive colonial project at home and abroad that paradoxicaUy weakened English sovereignty. No wonder James I, like Henry VIII and Elizabeth I before him, resorted to and encouraged magical self representations as a vatic monarch or "RoyaU Pan" able to work Orphic wonders, forming a union of nations where there had been none before (Patterson 1987, 147). A sim?ar mythological fantasy disastrously afflicted James I's son Charles I whose end can be ironicaUy likened to an Orpheus suffering a form of political sparagmos, or dismemberment, and who indeed saw himself as a martyr for a divine cause. Maley helps to flesh out what dev astating effect such imperial pretensions had upon the diverse people of many nations, the far-flung multitudes that the English crown's plan for a British dominion would colonize and marginaHze. Shakespeare is Maley s wandering bard of Britain singing or performing a kind of blues against the imperialism of the age, a figure somewhat comparable to Hadfield's more inteUectual version of Shakespeare as an English version of Lucan. Maley tears away at the naive, romantic mythologizing of Shakespeare as the English "swan of Avon" maintained by "we 'other' Elizabethans'" (2003,14). Maley observes, It is a mark of the split between culture and politics that John of Gaunt's speech [praising England as a "teaming womb of royal kings" in Richard II, 2.1] continues to dominate the canon of EngHsh literature, while Lear's "darker purpose" haunts the British state. Shakespeare has been loaded unceremoniously into the EngHsh canon, but he remains the banished bard of Britain, no less alienated from the state that nursed him than was</page><page sequence="14">Anthony DiMatteo 209 Bolingbroke by Richard II. We stiU await his triumphant return. (Maley 2003, 29) So too Skinner and van Gelderen's coUective shows that through most of the early-modern period dominated by monarchists, republican theory had to wander in the shadows. It must be situated "in relation to the ques tion of what sort and degree of liberty it was possible to enjoy under monar chical rule," as Xavier Gil phrases the chief republican theme in his study of republican politics in that most powerful of monarchies and empires, early modern Spain. Despite its relative lack of power and platform during Shakespeare's day, most traceable and persistent throughout the literature of the age is "the commonplace anthropomorphic image of the whole com munity" as a republic (2002, 1.264). It saliently functioned in the discourse of the period not only as a classical ideal of government endorsed by the clas sical philosophers Aristotle and Cicero but also as a sacred ideal or form of government as we find in the late-sixteenth century revolt of the Dutch Netherlands (a cause to which Sir Philip Sidney gave his life), where the image of a "new Israel" was a "powerful republican tool," as Lea Boralevi shows in her essay on the early-modern idea of a Jewish commonwealth (1.253). But its revolutionary potential was overwhelmingly countered by absolutists and their discourse and practice of a preemptive, dangerous "rea son of state" (the equivalent of today's umbreUa formula for executive privi lege, "for reasons of national security") that first became popular in European courts in the last decade of the sixteenth century. Kings' routine claims to speak law once and for aU were part of their attempt to appropriate republi can liberty for themselves, as if they could speak for all the common weal as in Thomas Hobbes' idea of the sovereign. The terminological registers of such statist attempts to take over republican discourse can be heard in the political Aristotelianism of the important early-seventeenth century German writer Arnisaeus whose practical, disciplinary approach to politics caUed for the redefinition of respublica "as the order of command and obedience." In this formulization most dangerous to long-lived traditions of natural-rights theory in western thought, the traditionaUy republican citizen-member of a city-state (civitas) "becomes the subject of the sovereign government" (1.210 [van Gelderen]). But the two volumes show that the diverse legacies of classical and Biblical republicanism could not be eliminated or co-opted by the monar chists. In her contribution to the section of volume two dedicated to the place of women in the republic, Christine Faur? observes that "where women were concerned, for want of an institutional framework for their activities within the body politic, it was through civic humanism that repub lican thinking about women's abilities developed, and civic humanism han</page><page sequence="15">210 College Literature 34.1[Winter 2007] died this theme through the reception of historic texts from Greek and Latin antiquity" (Skinner and van Gelderen 2002, 2.125-26).Through such resist ant cultivation, theories of an inclusive liberty stayed active. Judith Vega argues for the contemporary value of a "republican moment in feminism's agenda of principled ambivalence" (2.174). I note here how this republican prompted r??valuation of the role of women provides a most promising background against which, for example, to see Desiderius Erasmus's female figure for republicanist thinking, his famous FoUy, and, arguably, Shakespeare's conspicuous contribution in his persistent representation of eloquent women such as Portia in The Merchant of Venice, whose jurisprudential wisdom, so crucial to the resolution of the drama, symbolicaUy exists behind male dis guise. Another fruitful area of future research, it seems to me, is how we might place Shakespeare as a writer in something like an early modern republic-of-letters tradition stretching from what Erasmus caUed "the senate and people of the poets" (Ph?ips 1964, 232, 246) to what Boralevi identifies as "the international respublica literarum99 that Dutch academic circles addressed and helped form (1, 261) and to what Ludovico Muratori caUed for in 1704, the formation of a "literary republic" to "represent Italy in the Europe of culture" (2.251 [Pii]). Perhaps in this Europe of culture, Shakespeare belonged to a London-based school of republicanist verse and drama rather than an esoteric school of night as Muriel C. Bradbrook once argued. His being included along with Ben Jonson, John Marston, and George Chapman in a "Vatum Chorus" or "chorus of vatic bards" by the poems introducing that curious London publication, the 1601 Loves Martyr, arguably has a more politicaUy active, classical sense to it than just a band of poets (Cheney 2004,177). The two-volume coUective stimulates so many ways of rethinking Shakespeare and of putting the poHtics back in the early-modern period that it is impossible to do it justice in this review. One important perspective that could not be not stressed in the coUective confined to Europe was the view upon early-modern European government opened up by the conquered people of the Atlantic world. Spanish America, for example, developed republicanist institutions and traditions "notably the cabildo or council, and the widespread use of the formula obedezco pero non cumplo?T obey but do not comply'?by officials who considered a royal order inappropriate or unjust" (Cervantes 2006, 3). Be this as it may, these two volumes, together with the earlier coUective study Skinner helped assemble, Machiavelli and Republicanism (1990), con tribute mightily to advancing the study of republicanism as a shared heritage, one that we may easily place Shakespeare's contributions to republicanist thought within and one that, most evidently, needs r??valuation and rehis</page><page sequence="16">Anthony DiMatteo 211 toricization in the face of the kind of evangelical, authority-revering repub licanism we find in U.S. politics today Only through such reconstruction and intervention can we hazard a positive answer to my essay's title and say along with Hadfield that yes, Shakespeare was a republican, one not acknowledged for centuries now in literary criticism for reasons that deserve and wiU con tinue to reward the closest scrutiny. Notes 1 For Rukeyser's compUcated pluralist values, see AUison's recent essay. As for Pythagoras, I offer this personal anecdote. My coUeague Luis Navia, eminent schol ar of many books on Diogenes, recently deUvered a lecture to students and faculty on the golden verses of Pythagoras and the Pythagorean brotherhood that existed at the ancient Greek "utopian" settlement of Crot?n. At the end of his talk, I asked Professor Navia if he would kindly speculate how Pythagoras would have voted in the last presidential election. With a chuckle, Navia repUed,"Had he no other knowl edge, he would have been attracted by the name of the party alone and voted repub lican." It is against such misappropriations of repubUcanism at least as it can be his toricaUy reconstructed and understood that I dedicate this review essay. In doing so, I am in fuU agreement with what the contemporary political scientist Ph?ip Pettit has written by way of defining repubUcanism: "If you understand the experience of exposure and vulnerabiUty to another?the experience of domination?and if you can see what is awful about it, then you are weU on your way to understanding repubUcanism. This is republicanism, of course, as that doctrine has been understood in the long tradition, though not necessarily as it is understood in the manifestoes of contemporary political parties that go by that name" (2003, n.p.). 2 AU quotations of Shakespeare are from the Riverside edition.
