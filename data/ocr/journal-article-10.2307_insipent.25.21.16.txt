There will come a time before the completion of the QDR when DOD will look at both scenario sets and draw insights from them, he added. “It’s going to happen whenever Mattis and Marshall outbrief the results of their assessment,” he said. According to a draft Joint Staff memo, upon the completion of the QDR the Pentagon’s policy directorate will begin the development of a new lineup of defense planning scenarios via an “inclusive process” that will feature a review of the existing library by both DOD and outside experts, and will “ensure the family of scenarios is appropriately balanced to address the future threat environment” (ITP, May 14, p1). Told of the memo, Ochmanek said that “sounds right.” “I think that everyone is comfortable with the suite of scenarios we have now in light of the red team’s effort to supplement those,” he said. “And we recognize this is not the time to get out and rebuild the engine while we’re driving down this road. We’ll drive with what we have and then, after the QDR, review the whole suite of scenarios.” Some Pentagon officials have wondered whether the red team’s scenarios will be weighted equally in the QDR because they will be less detailed and prepared more quickly than the other scenarios. But Ochmanek insisted the red team’s work would be considered as important as the other scenario set. “Because of the stature of the people in charge of that effort, they’re going to carry just as much weight as what those of us down in the engine room are doing,” he said. Ochmanek is upbeat about the overall QDR effort. “So I feel pretty strongly that the approach we’re taking is sound, that it is strategy-based,” he said. “Whether we pull it off or not you can be the judge when we get to the end.” -- Christopher J. Castelli Official has been ‘all QDR all the time’ OCHMANEK AIMS TO CONNECT STRATEGY AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION For the last three months, David Ochmanek has been completely focused on the Pentagon’s ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review -- except, that is, when he can put in some hours on the Nuclear Posture Review, another work in progress. As the deputy assistant secretary of defense for force development and the head of the Quadrennial Defense Review analysis and integration cell, he has his hands full. In his first interview on the job, Ochmanek told Inside the Pentagon last week he has been “all QDR all the time since I walked in the building in late February -- except my night job is NPR.” With the fast pace of the ongoing reviews, he has not yet come to grips with what his roles and responsibilities will be after the QDR. “So, not to be too cute about it, when [Pentagon policy chief] Michèle [Flournoy] asked me to take this job she said, ‘I’m concerned that the gap that everyone acknowledges between strategy and resource allocation is as wide as it’s ever been and we need to fill in that gap. That gap is filled by force planning. And I want to basically reconstitute an office to do force planning inside policy.’ So I said I’m willing to give it a try. So that’s what we are.” Ochmanek describes his office as the connective tissue between strategy and resource allocation. “And we have a strategy office that now is physically incorporated in our space,” he said. “And we have a lot of people in the building who do programming and execution. What we don’t have is people to do that translation function.” Ochmanek’s office will draft the Guidance for the Development of the Force -- a key, classified strategic guidance document -- and participate in analyses aimed at improving the Pentagon’s understanding of operational needs going forward, he said. “And then all of this is also sort of happening in the hothouse of the QDR, albeit on a much [more] com- pressed time scale,” he added. Life will still be busy after the QDR, but “I hope not as busy,” he said, noting the basic purpose of the office will be the same but the modalities will be different. Special working groups that have been created for the purpose of the QDR will go away and will revert to whatever structure is permanent, he said. Assisting Ochmanek’s cell in the QDR are five groups focusing on irregular warfare, defeating high-end asym- metric threats, civil support at home and abroad, global posture, and business processes and cost drivers behind defense programs. “There was some reluctance to recreate a massive [integrated product team] structure for this QDR, which past QDRs have done and it hasn’t proven very satisfactory. So initially we called these issue leads,” he said, noting these groups do not work for him or for his QDR cell. Four of the five groups are carrying out work related to defense planning scenarios, aiming to shed more light on 14 INSIDE THE PENTAGON - www.InsideDefense.com - May 28, 2009 </page> <page sequence="2"> an assessment of the programmed force. “So they’re feeding insights to us but it’s not accurate to say they work for me or the AIC,” he said. How the QDR cell works with these groups varies. “The fifth group, cost drivers, is really sort of out there on their own because their work . . . is not looking at operational capabilities,” Ochmanek said. “Obviously, it’s looking at the other things that take up big parts of our resource base that aren’t tied to operations -- you know, health care, compensation, all that stuff. So that’s comptrol- ler led and we haven’t had very many interactions with them. The comptroller comes to the management meetings for the QDR; they’re cognizant of what we’re doing but they haven’t to my knowledge yet weighed in with any findings or insights.” -- Christopher J. Castelli Robust navigation sought DARPA WANTS FUNDING BOOST FOR INDEPENDENT BATTLEFIELD MACHINES The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is boosting its budget to develop advanced robotics technolo- gies that will operate more independently from U.S. forces on the battlefield, according to the Pentagon’s fiscal year 2010 budget justification documents. DARPA invested $15 million in the robust robotics program in FY-09; the agency wants to boost funding to $16.5 million in FY-10, the documents state. The program enables autonomous, unmanned mobile platforms to “perceive, understand and model their environment,” supporting warfighters in diverse landscapes, notes DARPA. It also aims to help machines navigate through complex, hazardous terrain, manipulate objects without human control, make intelligent decisions and interact cooperatively with other autonomous and manned vehicles. “A key objective is robust navigation and locomotion, since this underlies the ability to move through the difficult and unpredictable terrain of theater operations, which may include highly irregular and mountainous areas, partially-destroyed roads, rubble-filled urban terrain, and other vehicles and personnel,” DARPA writes. “Efforts are being made to develop learning and reasoning technologies to address specific concerns in both wheeled and legged robotic systems,” maintains the agency. “There is also interest in anthropomorphic humanoid robots that can leverage the worldwide infrastructure built for humans,” including occupying vehicle seats or climbing stairs. The program is also honing techniques to predict the future location and intent of moving objects, notes DARPA. U.S. national security will require future autonomous systems that achieve a much higher independence level when performing complex tasks, whether humans are present or not, the agency writes. The program’s FY-10 plans include developing “a mobile manipulator -- a four-wheeled mobile base and two arms, each with multi-fingered hands -- to serve as a common development platform,” documents state. Another objective is to develop a system whereby all data needed for recognition-based navigation of landmarks and topogra- phy will either be preloaded or obtained using on-board sensors. In this way, the vehicle will not receive any informa- tion from external sources. Although the Pentagon is trying to decide which traditional military tasks may be assigned to robots, the ma- chines will remain for some time in a “supervised autonomy” stage, predicted Ellen Purdy, the department’s enter- prise director of joint ground robotics (Inside the Pentagon, May 7, p1). In this phase, a robot can perform tasks without being directed to do so, but humans still are the ultimate decision-makers, Purdy told ITP. She added the intelligence associated with making a responsible decision involves a great deal of contextual information, making it an achievement that is “20, 30 years down the road.”  Peter Singer, author of “Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century,” told ITP he envisions a world mixed with robots and humans rather than one resembling the movie “The Terminator” dominated by autonomous machines. Future robots will “follow the play,” said Singer, of the Washington-based Brookings Institution, “but if they get new information, they’ll have enough leeway, enough leash, to still carry out the overall mission goal.” Robots are effective in certain roles like shooting with precision, Singer said. Military forces, however, are better equipped to figure out whether “that guy [is] a shopkeeper or is he an insurgent,” or to “have a cup of chai tea with that tribal elder and win his trust so that he tells him where the al Qaeda leader’s hiding out,” he added. Similarly, while machines can gather intelligence and act as artillery spotters in theater, working as special operators is not a subject that has been raised yet, he noted. The Pentagon often redefines “what we mean when we say humans will always be in the loop,” said Singer. “Everything’s happening so quick that our old definition of what it means to be in control of [robots] is really different,” he said. In the past, the military believed it was in charge of an unmanned aerial system because it could dictate every movement, but now the rationale is that the operator is always monitoring the unmanned aircraft and can stop it even though the system may be flying on its own, he noted. “We’re the ones slowly pulling ourselves out of control,” Singer asserted. -- Fawzia Sheikh INSIDE THE PENTAGON - www.InsideDefense.com - May 28, 2009 15 </page> </plain_text>
