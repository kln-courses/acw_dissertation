Best, Wesleyan University The large head of a cast-iron Buddha (title page, figs. 1 and 2) constitutes an important addition to the Detroit Institute of Arts' increasingly significant Korean collection. Acquired with the generous assistance of the Korean-American community of metropolitan Detroit, the head is one of the largest and finest examples of Korean Buddhist sculpture on public display in the West. Compared to the abundant notable specimens of Chinese and Japanese Buddhist art still extant, little of Korea's Buddhist artistic heritage has survived the peninsula's often- troubled history. The temples and monasteries of Korea suffered extensive damage during the major invasions of the Mongols in the thirteenth century, the Japanese in the sixteenth century, and the Manchus in the seventeenth century. Further losses resulted from the drastic restrictions that were imposed by the Neo- Confucian government of the Choson period (1392-1910) upon the practice of Buddhism in order to weaken the religion's economic and social influence. As a result of the many reverses suffered by Korean Buddhism over time, high quality large- scale free-standing Buddhist sculptures, especially those in materials other than stone and dating from prior to the fifteenth century (the period of the religion's greatest cultural vitality), are rare, even in Korea. Thus, as an exemplary representative of Korean Buddhist sculpture datable on stylistic grounds to the ninth century, Detroit's head is exceptional in terms of its art historical significance as well as its manifest aesthetic quality. The rarity and importance of the head is further enhanced by the distinctiveness of its iconography, specifically by the smooth protrusive rendering of the summit of the cranium. Buddhism was introduced to Korea from China in the late fourth century at a time when the peninsula was divided into the Figure 2. Korean, Head of Buddha (fig. 1), side view. domains of the three independent and often contentious royal states of Silla, Paekche, and Koguryo. Written evidence relating to the early history of Buddhism in Korea makes it clear that the rulers of the three kingdoms came to consider the foreign religion as a core component of both the respected culture and political strength of China. Accordingly, patronage of Buddhism was increasingly favored by Korea's royal families as a means of enhancing the prestige and authority of Figure 1.

In the mid-seventh century, Silla's rulers were able to fashion a close alliance with the emperors of the newly risen Tang dynasty (618-905) in China, which was rapidly developing into one of the mightiest and most illustrious regimes of that country's premodern past. The political and cultural benefits that accrued to Silla through its association with the Tang were many. It was, in fact, with the aid of Tang armies sent to Korea at SiUa's request that the rival kingdoms of Paekche and Koguryo were overthrown, and Silla's monarchs achieved political supremacy on the peninsula, a status that they were to maintain - at least in name - for a quarter of a millennium, an era known as the Unified Silla period (668-935). The rulers of Silla credited Buddhism with having an important role in the creation and the subsequent preservation of the first unified Korean state. Rituals performed at the lavishly endowed Buddhist temples of the royal capital, Kyongju, were believed to have extended divine protection to the kingdom, its leaders, and its armies. Close diplomatic relations between the governments of Silla and Tang China persisted throughout most of the Unified Silla period and enabled a flourishing cultural and commercial intercourse between the two nations. Many Silla monks studied at Chinese monasteries and a few, after traveling through China, even journeyed on to India. An influential number of these far-wandering monks returned to their Korean homeland with a knowledge not only of the religion's most current teachings and rituals, but also of the iconographically prescribed art forms that were essential for the symbolization of the former and the performance of the latter. Within Korea, Buddhism, propelled by royal Silla patronage, attained a position of unequaled cultural and societal influence, with its temples to be found in every corner of the land and its devotees drawn from every social class. The kings of the succeeding Koryo dynasty (935-1392), moreover, continued their predecessor's policy of unstinting support for Buddhism.1 Surviving examples of cast-iron Buddhist sculpture suggest that the use of this medium for fashioning major icons flourished in Korea during the approximately three hundred years from the early ninth century to the early twelfth century, a span encompassing the last century of the Unified Silla period and the first two centuries of Kory5 dynastic rule. The earliest extant, dated example of a Korean cast-iron Buddha is the seated depiction of the supreme Buddha Vairocana (Kor. Piroshana) in the Porim-sa (fig. 3), a still- functioning temple located near the southwestern tip of the peninsula in the province of Cholla-namdo. Cast into the back of the left arm of this icon is an inscription dating the image's creation to 858.2 Visually, the Porim-sa Vairocana differs notably from the Detroit Buddha head in the more linear treatment of the nose with its perfectly flat bridge formed by the highly stylized continuation of the arcing lines of the eyebrows. In contrast, the softer, more humanly naturalistic modeling apparent in the Detroit piece links it to the prime T'ang Chinese stylistic tradition of the late seventh and early eighth centuries, which was long favored by the Unified Silla court.3 Yet, the oval-shape of the Detroit head deviates conspicuously from the broad, almost circular face associated with the earlier T'ang-derived court style, which had remained dominant throughout Korea until the end of the eighth century. In this and the more naturalistic facial modeling, the Detroit piece closely resembles the late ninth- century seated stone image of Amitabha Buddha (Kor. Amita ) enshrined at the Piro-sa (fig. 4) in the province of Kyongsang-pukto.4 Also stylistically similar to the Detroit head is the seated granite image of Vairocana from the Ch'wiso-sa (fig. 5) in Kyongsang- pukto. On the basis of an inscription on a stone reliquary dated to 867 and discovered within the pagoda at the Ch'wiso-sa, it can be surmised that the construction of the temple with all its requisite ritual appurtenances, including the Vairocana image, was completed by approximately this date.5 Although less sensitively modeled than the Detroit head- a problem likely arising in part from the difficulties of working in this type of coarsely grained granite - the Ch'wiso-sa icon reveals in its visage a comparable fusing of a somewhat ovoid (or, at least, non-circular) shaping of the face with a basically naturalistic rendering of the facial features. It should Figure 4. Korean, Seated Amitabha Buddha , 9th century; granite and paint, h. 117.5 cm (46% in.). Piro-sa, Republic of Korea.

A stylized representation is icongraphically mandated for certain aspects of the Buddha's visage, such as the geometrically perfect arc of eyebrows. It should also be noted that both the application of white paint to the body surfaces and superimposition of painted facial details, like the moustaches, of the Ch'wiso-sa Vairocana are of recent date, although it is likely that the image was embellished in a more or less similar manner when it was originally installed in the temple. The cast-iron Vairocana of 858 from the Porim-sa (fig. 3) displays an analogous type of painted surface decoration, also of modern date, which serves a combination of iconographic and aesthetic ends. One important reason for the adoption of cast- iron as a medium for Buddhist statuary in Korea was that it offered a durable but less costly metallic alternative to bronze. Two significant disadvantages of using the less expensive medium, however, were that the exterior surfaces of a cast-iron sculpture were rougher than was the case with bronze, and the seams between the separately cast portions of such a sculpture were difficult to conceal. For both of these reasons, the cast-iron images of this era were typically coated with a thin layer of plaster and then either gilded or painted gold. Not only did the luster of the golden surface enhance the grandeur of the icon and strengthen the visual semblance to gilt bronze, but it also conformed to ancient descriptions of the Buddha as an effulgent being with skin of a golden hue. On the Detroit Buddha head, small remnants of the plaster undercoating that once covered the whole image are still visible in several places. In the cases of both large gilt- bronze and cast-iron images, certain anatomical attributes would be added in paints of iconographically appropriate hue following the application of gilt or gold paint to most surfaces. Included among these finishing touches might be the blackening of the hair, the reddening of the lips, and the detailing of the constituent parts of the eye, such as can be seen, albeit in modern rendition, on the seated Buddhas from the Porim-sa, the Piro-sa, and the Ch'wiso-sa. The similarity of the decorative finishing of cast-iron and gilt-bronze sculptures allowed the former to approximate visually the luster of the latter, even though its materials were of substantially less intrinsic value. Use of the cheaper cast-iron proved, over the course of time, to offer some measure of insurance for the icon's survival; images made of the more precious bronze were often melted down for the value of the metal. Exceedingly few examples of bronze sculpture of more than fifty centimeters in height have survived the varied tribulations suffered by Korean Buddhism, and there are none that can be dated with assurance to the period between the ninth and twelfth 16</page><page sequence="6">centuries. In contrast, nearly fifteen essentially intact large-scale cast-iron images are known from this period. All of these sculptures are depictions of Buddhas seated in the so-called "lotus position" of meditation. The consistent utilization of the seated pose may be assumed to have been a consequence of the massive weight of the cast-iron itself. The 58.6-centimeter (23yi6-in.)-high, or fully twice-life-sized, Detroit head weighs 53.3 kilograms (117 lb. 4 oz.). When dealing with weights of this magnitude, the structural value of the stable, broad-based triangular form of the meditative seated pose with its low center of gravity is apparent. This basic engineering concern makes it probable that the Detroit head also originally surmounted a seated figure.6 The first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha were fashioned in India at least half a millennium after the death of Sakyamuni (563-483 B.C.; Kor. Sokkamoni or Sokka-yorae), the historical Buddha and the founder of Buddhism. Prior to this time, much figurative Buddhist art had been produced for the didactic adornment of ritual centers, like the famous Great Stupa at Sanchi. In the aniconic art of this earlier era, however, the Buddha's presence was represented exclusively by symbols, such as the lotus blossom or his footprints with their distinctive device of a spoked-wheel design in the center. When Indian Buddhists began to make ritual use of iconic representations of the Buddha, which occurred no later than the second century, the only available information relating to Sakyamuni's physical appearance was the written descriptions preserved in sacred texts. By far the most influential and significant passages for both Buddhist thought and art were those found in accounts of £akyamuni's nativity concerning the propitious marks that were exhibited on the baby Buddha's body. According to beliefs current in India long before the advent of Buddhism, a person of genuinely epoch-making potential - a maha-purusa ("Great Man"; Kor. taejangbu) or a cakravartin ("Wheel- turning Conqueror"; Kor. yunwang) - would be recognizable by the presence of thirty-two primary and eighty secondary physical marks (Skt. lak$ana and anuvyahjana and Kor. sang and ho respectively).7 Masters of ancient lore who were accomplished in this form of physiognomic prognostication were believed to be able to foretell the dignity to be attained by a male child by determining the extent and the degree to which the sacred marks were manifest upon the child's body. Male gender was an essential prerequisite for future glory since one of the major marks was that the infant's masculine sexual organs be concealed in a sheath like those of a horse or, as one sacred text says of the newly born founder of Buddhism, his "testicles [are] withdrawn like an elephant's."8 Since India was the homeland of Buddhism, Indian Buddhist images provided the iconographic and, to a lesser extent, the stylistic standards that guided the fabrication of icons in all of the lands to which the religion spread. For this reason, although the most immediate influence on a Korean icon would typically be Chinese, virtually all iconographic characteristics of Korean images can be traced ultimately to an Indian source. In India, the list of these sacred physical marks of the maha-purusa provided the basic ingredients for any anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha Sakyamuni or any of the many other Buddhas that in due course came to be acknowledged by the religion. Certain of these marks were especially well-suited to visual representation and consequently were especially prone to the attachment of particular symbolic meanings. It was primarily the marks of the latter sort, joined by certain physical attributes considered both attractive and majestic in contemporary Indian notions of masculine beauty, that formed the basic descriptive repertoire for constructing an artistic representation of the Buddha. The majority of the most visually distinctive and religiously significant of the sacred marks are displayed on the head, perhaps in part because of the expressive primacy universally attributed to this one portion of the human body. Prominent among the laksana , or primary sacred marks, that adorn the head are the usnlsa (Kor. yukkye ), the rounded protuberance atop the cranium; the urna (Kor. paekho), the circular tuft of hair at the center of the Buddha's forehead; and the clockwise curling of the hair. Certain of the eighty secondary marks of the maha-purusa also contribute notably to the shaping of the Buddha's characteristic visage. Included among such attributes are the lack of a recession at the upper part of the bridge of the nose, the continuity of the two perfect arcs of the eyebrows, and the elongation of the eyes to resemble the petal of a lotus flower. The narrow slit-like aperture of the Detroit Buddha's iconographically correct elongated eyes constitutes an elegant artistic representation of the prescribed Buddhist practice of meditating with the eyes partially open. Also conspicuous among the characteristic facial features of the Buddha are those derived from early Indian notions of aristocratic male beauty, which, over time, came to be fixed components of Buddhist iconography, although they are not normally included among the major or minor marks of a maha-purusa. Features of this sort include the elongated lobes of the ears and the presence of three parallel fold lines on the front of the neck (Skt. trivati, Kor. samdo ). 17</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6. Indian, Standing Sakyamuni Buddha , late 6th century; brass with color, h. 39.4 cm (15% in.). Los Angeles County Museum of Art (M.70.17). Photo: Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The perfect body of the Buddha, with its full complement of the sacred marks, was not believed to be a serendipitous outcome of simple genetics. Rather, the propitious shaping of his body was understood as being the "natural" consequence of the countless previous karma-purifying lives of high moral merit through which the Buddha had passed prior to his final incarnation. Some Buddhist texts contain lists enumerating the kinds of actions that cause the appearance of the various sacred marks.9 Although there are differences of opinion among texts concerning whether or not the sacred marks present on the body of a Buddha are actually perceptible to the eyes of average mortals, all accounts agree that a knowledge of these marks is indispensable for certain meditational purposes. One important meditative practice, for instance, entails constructing a fully detailed vision of the Buddha that totally encompasses the conscious mind. For this mental image to be religiously efficacious, it must incorporate all the iconographic details of the true body of the Buddha. Buddhist iconic images, whether sculpted or painted, are intended to be able to serve as accurate models for the creation of such inner images. This type of meditation has as one of its primary purposes to realize the oneness of the image without and the image within as a way of experiencing the nondualistic truth that lies at the heart of Buddhism.10 The iconographically prescribed features visible on the Detroit Buddha head include the tightly coiled curls of hair, the geometric perfection of the eyebrows, the elongation of the earlobes and the eyes, and the remnants of the uppermost of the three lines on the neck (see fig. 2). Also evident is the usnTsa, the dome-like protuberance that forms the summit of the cranium. Most depictions of the usnTsa found on Korean Buddha images dating from before the twelfth century show the sacred protuberance totally covered with 18</page><page sequence="8">compact snail-shell curls of hair. In contrast to this standard mode of representation, the curls on the Detroit head extend only about halfway up the mound of the usnisa, thus serving to differentiate in both texture and contour the hair-covered base from the bare, rounded crest. This particular manner of depicting the usnisa has few pre-ninth- century precedents in East Asian Buddhist sculpture, and its early developmental history in the region is not entirely clear. A visually distinctive - but presumably symbolically similar - treatment of the usnisa was, however, to become increasingly common in Korean images of later date (see fig. 10), especially those produced under the iconographic influence of the Lamaistic Buddhism of Mongolia and, ultimately, Tibet. Beginning during the Mongol occupation of the peninsula in the thirteenth century and continuing into the modern era, Korean Buddhas came to be frequently adorned with a proportionally smaller and sometimes columnar (or even rectangular) secondary protrusion atop the usnisa. The fashion for such secondary protrusions in later times was, in fact, sufficiently strong that in some instances they were affixed to earlier images that had originally lacked them. Such is the case with the Porim-sa cast-iron Buddha (fig. 3), which has been further iconographically enhanced by the addition of the smooth clay crescent that is nestled among the figure's curls at the base of the usnisa and directly above the urna at the center of the forehead. The latter iconographic device, which had become prevalent in Chinese Buddhist imagery by the tenth century, is known in Korean Buddhist terminology as a changom-gu (Ch. chuang-yen-chu) . It is regarded as a sign of the Buddha's transcendent knowledge and as a source of wonder-working rays of incandescent energy (see also figs. 9 and 10).11 The usnisa is one of the most prominent of the major sacred marks in Buddhist art and literature, yet it is also the one whose depiction has been perhaps the most subject to varying interpretations over time and from place to place within the Buddhist world. In the texts of early Indian Buddhism, the usnisa of the Buddha is described as being "like a royal turban."12 In the later Buddhism of East Asia, usnisa is most frequently written with two characters that together signify "fleshy top- knot" (Kor. yukkye, Ch.ju-chi). Even within India, early artistic representations of the u$nisa differed markedly from one region to another, with those from the north central section of the subcontinent com- monly being shaped like a conical coil of hair, those from the northwest like a highly piled bun of wavy hair, and those from the southeast often being merely a slight ovoid elongation of the skull covered with snail- shell curls of hair.13 By the end of the fourth century, there had evolved through- out India a propensity for rendering the u$nisa as a clearly defined, essentially hemispherical bump on top of the head with the whole upper cranium (including the usnisa) being thickly covered with snail-shell curls. This fashion spread throughout the Buddhist world and by the end of the sixth century had become the standard representation of the usnisa in Korea and China. There also has existed some diversity in Buddhist understandings concerning the significance of this sacred protuberance. Being one of the most physically con- spicuous of the thirty-two major marks of the maha-purusa , the usnisa apparently was initially interpreted as one outward indication of the extraordinary potential that was Sakyamuni's from birth. In time, however, the usnisa also came to be closely associated with the special enlightened wisdom (Skt. samyak sarhbodhi , Kor. clwnggak) that constitutes the sine qua non of Buddhahood. As stated in a commentary concerning the A mitayurbuddhanusmrti sutra composed by the Chinese monk Figure 7. Indian, Seated Buddha from Bodhgaya, pre-9th century; black stone, h. 117 cm (46»/16 in.). Gaya Museum, India (0.32). Photo: Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Bihar. Chih-li in 1021, the usnisa "indicates the perfect enlightenment of the Buddha"14 Seemingly, it was because of the special religious importance attached to the usnisa as the primary "corporal" emblem of the merit and profound truth of the Buddha that it acquired the distinction among the various sacred marks of being symbolically represented by its own divinity, widely venerated in esoteric Buddhism, known as Usnisavijaya ("Victorious Goddess of the Usnisa Kor. Choesung-pulckong).15 The connection between the Buddha's high meditative attainment and the usnisa accords well with traditional yogic notions of the raising of energy up the spinal column, ultimately and ideally to emerge 19</page><page sequence="9">Figure 8.

The display and mastery of the radiant energy (tejas) generated through advanced ascetic and meditative practice has long been recognized in India as the hallmark of an accomplished yogi. In keeping with this tradition, the usrusa of the Buddha, who is considered to be the supreme yogi, is repeatedly represented in sacred text and art as being either radiant itself or as the source of divine flames or beams of light. As is said of the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra : 0 World-Honored One! The Thus Come One is most rare! By reason of his merit and wisdom, a knot of flesh on the crown of his head shines with a bright glow . . ,16 Nor was the incandescence associated with the usrusa a mere passive indication of the Buddha's meditational development; the sacred protuberance was also believed to be the source of extraordinary forces of laser-like luminosity that were subject to his conscious control. In the Surahgama sutra, for example, it is related that the omniscient Sakyamuni, being aware that his disciple Ananda was in danger of being seduced by a scheming prostitute in a nearby town, successfully strengthened the monk's weakening resolve by extending to him "out from the top of his head a bright and triumphant multicolored light within which appeared a transformation Buddha, seated, with crossed legs, on a thousand petalled lotus."17 In southeastern India, Sri Lanka, and throughout most of Southeast Asia, the luminous potency of the Buddha's enlightenment associated specifically with the usrusa has regularly, and seemingly from a relatively early date, been symbol- ized in sculptural representations.18 This effect has been variously achieved by either surmounting the usrusa with a sparkling jewel or a stylized flame device or by leaving the upper portion of the Figure 9.

Less graceful in its modeling and possibly somewhat later in date, although certainly not later than the eighth century, is a polished stone image of a seated Buddha from Bodhgaya (fig. 7).21 The otherwise curl-covered usnisa of this image terminates in a bare, rounded cone, rather like the tip of a lotus blossom, which compares closely with one rendition of the usnisa common in Southeast Asian Buddhist icons of the eighth century and later.22 The example of Indian Buddha images with the upper portion of the usnisa left bare and, presumably, made luminous with gold leaf evidently prompted emulation in East Asia as early as the seventh century. In Korea, for instance, a version of this particular treatment of the usnisa is to be found on the well-known standing Buddha from the stone triad at Pae-ri in Kyongju (fig. 8), which may be dated to the first half of the seventh century.23 After the middle of the seventh century, however, the concern with representing the usnisa' s effulgence in the sculpture of East Asia seems to have abated, and it is not until the ninth and tenth centuries that it reappears in what proved a relatively stable iconographic tradition of long duration. In its re- emergent manifestation, the luminous crest of the usnisa came to be most commonly rendered in the more distinctively contoured jewel-like forms utilized by the esoteric Buddhist sculptural tradition of the Himalayas and the northern Central Asian steppe which, in turn, had developed from the sharply defined type present on the sixth-century brass Indian Buddha (fig. 6). A fairly characteristic representation of this kind of luminous usnisa as it occurs in later East Asian art may be seen on a small seated bronze Chinese Buddha in the Brundage Collection (fig. 9), which is also distinguished by its earrings and by the presence at the base of the u$nisa of the additional crescent-shaped source of radiance previously mentioned in connection with the Porim-sa Vairocana (fig. 3). The delineation of the usnisa's radiant apex was subject to variation, especially during the initial phases of its . re-emergence as an element of East Asian Buddhist iconography. In addition to the more assertively contoured depictions, there were also current in China and Korea more gently rounded and less obtrusively defined renderings of this iconographic feature.24 The curl-less, but likely once gilded, crest of the Detroit Buddha head is clearly related to the latter sort. In this regard, it is more similar to the bare, broad-based protuberance on the usnisa of the ninth-century Buddha from the Ch'wiso-sa (fig. 5) than to the typical later formulation of this feature such as that on the Brundage Collection's Buddha or, to cite a Korean example, on the eleventh- century Koryo cast-iron seated Buddha from Tanho-sa in Ch'ungju (fig. 10). The ninth century dominates the important turning point in Korean history known as the Late Silla period, which extends from the last decades of the eighth century to the rise of the Koryo dynasty in 935. It was a time when the influence of Silla's kings steadily eroded and effective political control increasingly passed into the hands of regional magnates and military commanders. This progressive decentralization of power and wealth had notable repercussions upon Buddhist sculpture. On one hand, the authority of the more overtly T'ang Chinese styles long favored at the Silla capital waned with the declining fortunes of the royal court. On the other hand, as local grandees became the primary patrons of temples within their spheres of influence, regional stylistic diversity was encouraged. Some regions, moreover, because of their geographic position or the trade policies of their political overlords, were more open than others to fresh stylistic and iconographic influences emanating from China or, in certain cases, Manchuria. The more naturalistically modeled facial features and the ovoid shaping of the Detroit head contrasts - to its advantage - with the broader and heavier visages found on most late Silla images. This may reflect a local stylistic preference based- as would also seem to be the case with the unusual iconography of its u$nisa - on recent borrowings from China (see fig. 9) that had, in turn, ultimately been inspired by the example of Indian Buddhist art. Yet, in this instance, these new and seemingly foreign elements have been forged by the hands of Korean sculptors into a work of art that possesses a striking visual integrity of its own while abiding fully within the formal parameters requisite to efficacious Buddhist icons. 22</page><page sequence="12">Figure 10.

There are two moderately sized holes in the Detroit Buddha head, one in the front and one in the rear of the cranium. This damage, like the jaggedness of the break at the neck, suggests that the destruction of the original sculpture was violent. As was indicated at the start of this essay, invasion and armed strife are recurrent themes in Korea's post-twelfth-century history. Since nothing is known with certainty concerning the provenance of the Detroit head, it is difficult to determine when and under what circumstances the damage was done. 7.

Conze, trans., The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom (Berkeley, Calif., 1975), 657-665, especially 659-665. 10. H. Zimmer, Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India , trans. G. Chappie and J. B. Lawson (Princeton, N.J., 1984), 21-64. 11. I have thus far been unable to find a name applied to this particular iconographic device in any sources other than Korean art historical texts of modern date. For an instance of the usage of changom-gu , see Hwang Su-yong, ed., Kukpo (Seoul, 1984), vol. 2, Kumdong-bul, maae-bul , 68, pl. 62, and 216. For the luminosity of this device, see A. L. Soper, "Some Late Chinese Bronze Images (Eighth to Fourteenth Centuries) in the Avery Brundage Collection . . .' ," Artibus Asiae 31 (1969): 34. 12. For example, it is so described in the Mahapadana suttanta of the Digha nikdya, ii: 17-19. See T. W. and C. A. F. Rhys Davids, trans., Dialogues of the Buddha , 4th ed. (London, 1959), 14-16, esp. 16. 13. A. K. Coomaraswamy, "The Buddha's cuda , Hair, usnlsa , and Crown," Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 3d ser. (1928): 815-841. 14. Chih-li, Kuan wu-liang-shou-fo ching-shu miao-tsung- ch'ao 6 as quoted in Taisho shinshu daizdkyo 37, 1751 (Kyoto, 1922-1933): 227a. This passage applies to both the usnlsa and an iconographic attribute known literally as "the crest that cannot be seen" (Skt. an- avalokita-murdhatas, Kor. mugyonjong-sang ), an invisible characteristic of the Buddha included on some lists of the eighty minor sacred marks. 15. Usnlsavijaya is the best known and most widely revered of a large group of usnlsa- related esoteric deities, although it may be that the conception that she constitutes a deification of the supreme merit and wisdom represented by the usnlsa is particularly pronounced in northeast Asia. See Sawa Ryuken, Butsuzo zuten (Tokyo, 1962), 45-46. Also see A. Getty, Gods of Northern Buddhism (Oxford, 1928), 135. 16. L. Hurvitz, trans., Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma (New York, 1976), 330. 17. Lu K'uan-yii (also known as Charles Luk), trans., The Surangama Sutra (London, 1966), 2. A "transformation" Buddha is the standard Buddhist term for a miraculously generated, non-substantial image of the Buddha. 18. The proper designation for representations of the u$nlsa's luminosity is a problematic issue. The more overtly flame-like ornament atop the usnlsa common in Southeast Asian imagery from at least the eleventh century onwards is known as a siraspota in Sri Lanka (D. L. Snellgrove, ed.. The Image of the Buddha [Tokyo and New York, 1978), 142 and 454) and as ketumala in Thailand (R. Le May, A Concise History of Buddhist Art in Siam [Rutland, Vt., 1962], 118-119). It is said that the jewel-like protuberance common to Himalayan esoteric sculpture is known, in its Sanskrit form, as the cudamani within Tibet (L. A. Waddell, The Buddhism of Tibet, 2nd ed. [Cambridge, England, 1959J, 343 and 587), and this is also the designation used by some Korean scholars (Kor. kyeju or sometimes poju). For an instance of the latter, see Mun Myflngdae 1978 (note 4), 125-126 and 132. For a helpful study of this problem as it concerns Southeast Asian and, to some extent, Himalayan sculpture, see H. W. Woodward, Jr., "The Buddha's Radiance," Journal of the Siam Society 61 (1973): 187-191. It has recently been suggested that rasmi may be appropriate as a generic designation that encompasses at least the several types of secondary cranial protuberance found in Southeast Asian Buddhist art. See H. W. Woodward, Jr., "Some Buddhist Symbols and Their Ancestry," in Kaladarsana- American Studies in the Art of India, ed. J. G. Williams (New Delhi, 1981), 165-168 and 171, n. 3. 19. One seemingly early example of the sculptural symbolization of the usnlsa's radiance is to be found on a likely southeast Indian small bronze standing Buddha image excavated at Korat in Thailand, which has been dated by Le May to the fourth century at the latest. See R. Le May 1962 (note 18), 15-16 and pl. 4. There is also a striking bronze standing Buddha image of the fifth or sixth century from Indonesia that is adorned with a contrasting usnlsa of pure gold. It is now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, but was excavated in Java and is thought to have been made in either Sri Lanka or southeastern India. The golden usnlsa in this case is believed to be a later - but not modern- addition. See P. L. Scheurleer, ed., Asiatic Art in the Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam, 1985), 24</page><page sequence="14">175, pl. 185. Hsiian-tsang, the famous Chinese pilgrim who traveled in India during the first half of the seventh century (629-645), recounts two tales from Sri Lanka that deal with a jewel mounted on top of the usnlsa. It is clear from his narrative that such an addition to the sacred protuberance was not felt to require any special explanation. See Hsiian-tsang, Buddhist Records of the Western World, trans. S. Beal (London, 1911), 2: 249-253. 20. Sakyamuni is depicted with a radiant usnlsa in a painting representing his temptation by Mara in Cave I at Ajanta, a cave that likely dates to the late fifth or early sixth century. See G. Yazdani, Ajanta (London, 1933-1955), plates vol. 1: pl. XXV111 and XXIXa. 21. The dating of this figure is subject to some dispute. F. M. Asher dates it to the eighth century; see his The Art of Eastern India, 300-800 (Minneapolis, 1980), 76 and pl. 140. S. L. Huntington, on the other hand, dates it to the mid-to-late fifth century or possibly "slightly later"; see her The "Pala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture (Leiden, The Netherlands, 1984), 15-16 and n. 23. also fie. 7. 22. See, for instance, the eighth-century stucco "Dvaravati" Buddha head excavated at Nakhon Pathom (now in the Bangkok National Museum) as illustrated in S. Van Beek and L. 1. Tettoni, The Arts of Thailand (Hong Kong, 1985), 64. Buddhas from the famous early ninth-century Indonesian site of Barabudur (Borobudur) also display a comparable secondary protuberance on top of the ustusa. See H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia (New York, 1955), 2: pls. 493 and 494. 23. For a similar treatment of the usnlsa on a Chinese image also dating to the early seventh century, see the seated Buddha on the west wall of Cave 244 at the cave-temple site of Tun-huang as illustrated in T. Akiyama and S. Matsubara, Arts of China (Tokyo and Palo Alto, Calif., 1969), vol. 2, Buddhist Cave Temples - New Researches, 63, pl. 38, and 213-214. 24. For a Chinese rendition of the less pronouced type of secondary protuberance on the usrusa, see the bronze seated Vairocana likely dating not later than the early tenth century in the Nitta Group Collection of Buddhist Art, Tokyo, as illustrated in Taipei, National Palace Museum, The Crucible of Compassion and Wisdom (1987), 184, pl. 88, and 418 (English i.d.). 25</page></plain_text>
