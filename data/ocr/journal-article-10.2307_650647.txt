Traditionally scholars have concentrated their enquiries mainly in two different directions: the history of learned jurispru- dence and the institutional developments resulting from the growth of royal legislation.3 Anthropologists enquiring into the legal arrange- ments of other societies have posed different questions. While many of their conclusions are based on specific case studies, in the attempt to evolve certain cross-cultural and comparative methodological tools they have considered several problems of universal validity, and the resultant conclusions could, mutatis mutandis, be applied to the evolution of European legal practice in the past.4 In the first place, they have attempted to reach a universally * An earlier version of this paper was delivered at the Annual Conference of the Association for Medieval and Renaissance Studies of Israel (June 1983).

One such distinction is that custom embodied social norms, while law had to pass through a process of "double institutionalization" before reaching coercive, posited status.6 While legal historians have always clearly distinguished be- tween custom and law, their emphasis was usually on origin rather than on institutionalization. Society may create custom, but legislation was the ruler's province.7 This dichotomy of law and custom is problematic in the context of actual continental medieval justice.8 Side by side with legislation there was a continuous dynamic process of legal practice. Though the study of court records independently from law-codes and jurispru- dential literature is still in its early stages, one fact is beginning to emerge. The practice of medieval law was not necessarily dictated by its prescriptions. This phenomenon has been observed in other societies by some anthropologists who concluded that an absolute "congruence between ideology and social structure", or between the theoretical form of law envisaged by legislators and the reality of the court-house was a myth.9 In fact no medieval ruler possessed an 5 This attempt has produced a wide variety of definitions, ranging from Mali- nowski's, emphasizing the role of mutual social obligations, to Bohannan's, stressing the authoritarian and coercive character of law: B. Malinowski, Crime and Custom in Savage Society (London, 1926); Paul Bohannan, "The Differing Realms of Law", Amer. Anthropologist, lxvii (1965, special issue), pp. 33-42. Perhaps the most encom- passing definition is the one proposed by Leopold Pospisil, who saw law as possessing four necessary attributes: authority, intention of universal application, [mutual] obliga- tion and sanction: L. Pospisil, Kapauku Papuans and their Law (New Haven, 1958), pp. 257-72; L. Pospisil, Anthropology of Law: A Comparative Theory (New York, 1971), pp. 39-96. This definition bears a startling resemblance to the one propounded by Thomas Aquinas: "an ordinance of reason, for the common good, made by him who has the care of the community, and promulgated": Summa theologiae (Rome, 1886), 1st pt. of the 2nd pt., q. 90, art. 3. 6 The term is Bohannan's: "The Differing Realms of Law", pp. 34-7; but most modern authorities, in a reaction to Malinowski's approach, have insisted upon the institutional, coercive character of law. For a present-day assessment of Malinowski's importance, see Irving L. Horowitz, "Crime, Custom and Culture: Remarks on the Functionalist Theory of Bronislaw Malinowski", Internat. Jl. Comparative Sociol., iii (1962), pp. 229-44. 7 This opinion has prevailed in western culture from the Bible and Aristotle to Thomas Hobbes. 8 I have deliberately excluded from the discussion the development of the system of English common law, which is an entirely different process. 9 See Moore, Law as Process, p. 69, discussing Chagga society: "... although universality of application is often used as one of the basic elements in any definition of law, universality is often a myth. Most rules of law . . . affect only a limited category of persons in a limited number of situations".

Moreover the existence of inviolable traditions circumscribed the very ability to legislate. A ruler could attempt either to enforce or to ignore them, but he was almost never able legally to abrogate the existent body of usage. Those traditions, incorporated into medieval customary codes, held a position peculiar to European society. Unlike many human groupings studied by legal anthropologists, medieval Europe was not an illiterate society. It was composed of a small but ever-increasing literate element and a large but decreasing illiterate segment. For a long time the privilege of stating the law in practical terms was within the province of a largely non-literate element. 10 The force of custom was such that it was eventually incorporated into the written tradition, often achieving by the end of the middle ages the full force of posited law. At that point the distinction between law and custom became formal rather than functional, even the most ardent supporters of Roman and monarchic law recognizing the legal validity of custom." Beyond the definition and circumscription of the law, anthropolo- gists have usually insisted upon examining each legal system within its specific socio-cultural context.12 In different societies legal processes could serve not only to preserve order and justice, but also to settle scores, safeguard hierarchical structures, provide a setting for the testing and consolidation of societal values, legal or otherwise, and a stage for ritual drama that reinforced society's self-image.13 While the exact origins of European legal customs are still an open question, there is no doubt that they were firmly anchored in specific cultural and social contexts and fulfilled certain societally specific functions in consequence. These customs and their practical application in 10 In France this privilege was maintained until the end of the middle ages in the form of the enquete par turbe, which determined the exact local custom of any given place on the strength of the evidence of at least ten turbiers.

Furthermore, their functions cannot be explained exclusively in terms of peace-keeping or dispute settle- ment. Medieval society could use its courts for a multitude of pur- poses, many of them beyond the purely legal sphere. The concept of culture has been so widely and indiscriminately used that it is necessary to circumscribe its meaning within the terms of this paper. While legal processes may have sprung from certain beliefs, rituals and perceptions that form part of the general expression of spirit commonly termed culture, those processes in themselves consist equally of a cultural manifestation, not only in so far as they stem from a specific cultural environment, but also because they contribute to the formation of the same environment. As a rule historians have posited a dichotomy between learned and popular elements of culture.14 It is impossible to apply this distinction to the realm of European law. Like other literate societies, Europe possessed a remarkable multiplicity of legal levels, both in the realms of theory and of practice.15 Learned Roman glosses, royal legislation, canon law, customals and urban statutes existed side by side, each one created and affected by a different social group and expressing a different facet of contemporary culture, but constantly interpenetrat- ing and influencing each other.16 Both civil and criminal justice were administered by royal, feudal, seigneurial, urban and ecclesiastical courts. Judicial culture, therefore, was hardly a monolithic manifesta- tion. It contained the consilium of the Bologna professor, the town magistrate's sentence and the peasant's evidence. It could not be classified as either popular or learned, its very scope making possible the incorporation of those widely divergent elements. This considerable complexity is hardly amenable to any generalized typology. In one realm, however, the historian has the advantage over the anthropologist: he or she can follow the evolution of legal practice over a long period of time. The "processual character of law", as Moore calls it,17 has long been self-evident to historians. Law is made and re-made through constant practice, and any static description of a dynamic phenomenon must necessarily be faulty. 14 See, for example, Robert Muchembled, Culture populaire et culture des elites (Paris, 1978). 15 Pospisil, Anthropology of Law, pp. 97-126. 16 See, for example, John H. Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance: England, Germany, France (Cambridge, Mass., 1974), tracing the development of the inquisitorial procedure in canon and civil law. 17 Moore, Law as Process, pp. 42-8. 9</page><page sequence="5">Given the existent knowledge of past legal and institutional develop- ments and of the evolving relationship between elite and popular cultural expressions, it is possible to attempt a long-term interpreta- tion. One such practice, the criminal prosecution and execution of animals, may illustrate the interaction of various legal levels and cultural influences. These trials, documented in European legal his- tory from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century, occupy an inter- mediate position between popular and elite legal culture. On the one hand, they were definitely not judicial folklore: the sentences were passed and executed in properly constituted courts of law by fully qualified magistrates, according to generally accepted laws. On the other hand, there is no question that they were an integral part of customary law and owed their continued existence partially to popular traditions and influences. Their history illustrates the continual inter- action between popular and learned elements in the sphere of legal practice. At the same time, their various stages of development serve as evidence of the processual and dynamic character of western law. Following the phenomenon through the warp and woof of legal history, from court-house to university and from customals to the gallows across centuries of changing perceptions of nature, law and justice, one might attempt an interpretation of continental European law as practised within its specific cultural context. MORPHOLOGY Several European legal levels were involved in trials of animals. They were held before royal, urban, seigneurial and ecclesiastical courts. Nevertheless, they followed only two distinct procedures, secular and ecclesiastical. While the former type was used to penalize domestic beasts that had mortally injured a human being, the latter was employed to rid the population of natural pests that could not indi- vidually be punished. The two types were clearly distinct in form and development, and therefore require separate description. In December 1457 the sow of Jehan Bailly of Savigny and her six piglets were caught in the act of killing the five-year-old Jehan Martin. All seven pigs were imprisoned for murder and brought to trial a month later before the seigneurial justice of Savigny. Besides the judge, the protocol recorded the presence at the trial of one lawyer (function unspecified), two prosecutors (one of them a lawyer and a councillor of the duke of Burgundy), eight witnesses by name, "and several other witnesses summoned and requested for this cause". 10 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 110</page><page sequence="6">LAW, FOLKLORE AND ANIMAL LORE Though the owner was formally the defendant, it is clear from the proceedings that he stood accused only of negligence and was in no danger of any personal punishment. Moreover he was allowed to argue in court "concerning the punishment and just execution that should be inflicted upon the said sow", if he could give any reason why the sow should be spared. The owner having waived this right, the prosecutor requested a death sentence. The judge, having heard all the relevant testimony and consulted with wise men knowledgeable in local law, ruled, according to the custom of Burgundy, that the sow should be forfeit to the justice of Savigny for the purpose of hanging by her hind legs on a suitable tree. The piglets created a more difficult problem as there was no proof that they had actually bitten the child, though they were found bloodstained. They were therefore remanded to the custody of their owner, who was required to vouch for their future behaviour and produce them for trial, should new evidence come to light. When the latter refused to give such a guarantee, the piglets were declared forfeit to the local lord's justice, though they suffered no further punishment. The court brought from Chalon-sur-Saone a professional hangman who carried out the execution according to the judge's specific instructions.18 The case of the sow of Savigny is typical in many respects of most secular animal trials. In the first place, it was held in Burgundy, one of the earliest areas to record such cases. Animal trials were first mentioned during the thirteenth century in northern and eastern France, whence they spread to the Low Countries, to Germany and to Italy. The defendant's porcine nature also recurred in a great many trials. Pigs, who seem to have accounted for the deaths of many unattended infants, were the most common culprits, but there are also records of homicidal oxen, cows, horses and dogs. Most of all, the trial is typical in its painstaking insistence upon the observance of legal custom and proper judicial procedure. This was neither a vindictive lynching nor the extermination of a dangerous beast. Other records mention, in addition to pre-trial imprisonment, the granting of remissions to wrongly accused beasts, the burning in effigy of a "contumacious" animal, and the public display of an executed cow's 18 The full text of the trial has been published by J.

Some of them closely paralleled the human precedent while others prescribed a peculiarly "animal" form of death. Thus in some places animals were dragged and hung like human murderers, while in others the authorities resorted to strangling or a knock on the head.21 The use of a tree instead of the "human" gallows was also occasionally apparent, though even then a proper hangman performed the job. Where the hangman's bills are extant, they closely resemble those presented for the execution of humans.22 The history of ecclesiastical trials is less clear-cut.

This anthropomorphic attitude was expressed also in the language of the sentences: one stated that a pig had "committed and perpetrated . . . murder and homicide": ibid., p. 120; another pig had "killed and murdered" a child: Evans, Criminal Prosecution, p. 336. A third had shown "cruelty and ferocity" by killing a human being: ibid., p. 357. 20 Coustumes et stilles de Bourgoigne (1270-1360), art. 197: "L'on dit et tient selon droit et la coustume de Bourgoigne que se un boeuf ou un cheuau fait un ou pluseurs homicides il nan doiuent poinct morir, ne Ion nen doit faire justice, feur quilz doiuent estre pris par le seigneur en qui justice ilz on fait le delit ou par ses gens, et lui sont confisquez et doiuent estre vendus et exploictiez au prouffit du dit seigneur; mes se autres bestes ou juyf le font, ilz doiuent estre pendus par les piez derreniers" ("It is stated according to the law and custom of Burgundy that if an ox or a horse commit one or more homicides, they should not die, nor should they be tried and executed. Rather, they should be impounded by the lord in whose jurisdiction they had committed the crime, or by his men, to be confiscated and sold for the said lord's profit. But if another animal or a Jew do it, they should be hung by their rear legs"): quoted by C. Giraud, Essai sur I'histoire du droitfrancais au moyen dge, 2 vols. (Paris, 1846), ii, p. 302. While this type of execution was applied to Jews all over Europe, its use for animals is peculiar to Burgundy. 21 For "non-human" types of execution, see Berkenhoff, Tierstrafe, pp. 24-40. 22 For bills presented upon the execution of animals, see Evans, Criminal Prosecution, pp. 336-9; Berkenhoff, Tierstrafe, pp. 118-19.

As in the case of secular trials, the phenomenon had a clearly discernible geographic epicentre. All the early trials took place in Switzerland and the bordering areas: Savoy, the Dauphine and the Italian Alps. Subsequently the practice spread much farther than secular trials ever did, relying upon the international network of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. In the following centuries ecclesiastical animal trials were held not only in France, Germany and Italy, but also in Scandinavia, Spain, Canada and Brazil.23 These cases differed in procedure as little as possible from human trials. Though considered criminal, they were initiated by accusatory procedure, whereby the people of the affected diocese sued their natural scourges before the episcopal court. Prior to holding any proceedings, bishops usually insisted upon public penitence, almsgiv- ing and the payment of due tithes as the best remedies for any natural heaven-sent scourge.24 Subsequently the court, viewing insensate creatures as the equivalent of vulnerable minors, appointed an advo- cate for the defence. Thus, when in 1587 the syndics of the commune of Saint-Julien-de-Maurienne sued the flies that were destroying their vineyards, the bishop's official promptly appointed a lawyer at a modest salary, "lest the animals against whom the action lies should remain defenceless".25 The arguments between the lawyers on both sides, duly presented in writing, considered and rebutted, cover a wide range of issues. In this specific case they centred around two questions: the possibility of excommunication of animals by a human court (since this was the penalty the plaintiffs requested), and the survival rights of both man and animal in nature. Other cases raised the even more basic issue of the very jurisdiction held by any human judge over animals, but this point was invariably resolved in favour of the court, which being ecclesiastical drew its authority from the universal validity of canon law. The same argument answered also the problem of excommunica- tion, but the right to survival was more problematic. The Saint-Julien 23 For a thorough analysis of the procedure, development and spread of the ecclesi- astical trials, see Karl von Amira, "Thierstrafen und Thierprocesse", Mitteilungen des osterreichischen Instituts fur Geschichtsforschung, xii (1891), pp. 560-72. 24 This was also the procedure recommended by the Spanish theologian Azpilcueta to the people of Sorrento who wished to prosecute certain fish that infested their waters.

The entire protocol of the trial was published by Leon Menabrea, De l'rigine, de la forme et de l'esprit des jugements rendus contre les animaux (Chambery, 1846), appendix. 13</page><page sequence="9">plaintiffs argued that animals existed solely for the utility of man and should be punished if they acted contrary to his interests, while the defence countered that God had granted animals the enjoyment of nature even before the very creation of man. The latter argument was unanswerable enough to make the commune offer the flies an alternative in the form of a piece of land away from the vineyards, but well-provided with water and vegetation. It should be emphasized, however, that there was no pretence of a reasonable settlement with the insects. Rather, the underlying idea was that if the verdict was accepted, the church could enforce such an arrangement. The insensate character of the insects was in no doubt, but the ever- recurring insistence upon proper procedure and due justice created an impression of anthropomorphism. Thus, when the rats of Autun failed to appear in court in response to a formal summons, their advocate pleaded his clients' fear of cats as an excuse, demanding a safe-conduct for the accused. Years later when he was one of the leading jurists of France, Bartholome Chassenee had his plea quoted back to him as a supreme example of most thoroughgoing justice.26 A court that saw itself as possessing the God-given right to try all living creatures, human and otherwise, had to grant all of them justice. It was this same concept of justice that allowed far more flexibility in the verdict of ecclesiastical courts than in secular ones. Conviction in ecclesiastical animal trials was not a foregone conclusion. While the verdict in Saint-Julien is unknown due to a lacuna in the text, elsewhere the court did accept the advocate's arguments, assigning the animals a place to live unmolested and unmolesting.27 Still, the 26 For thorough reviews of the pro and con arguments, see Bartholome Chassenee, Concilium primum de excommunicatione animalium, in his Concilia D.

Though both types of trials were common in the early modern period, it is impossible to set a clear terminus ad quem for either practice. During the eighteenth century they became increasingly rare and informal, often taking the form of village justice. A legal practice that had survived for half a millennium died out. INTERPRETATION The very existence of animal trials in Europe poses severe problems for the historian of western culture. The practice runs counter to all commonly accepted conceptions of justice, humanity and the animal kingdom; and yet it survived and flourished for centuries. Moreover the increasing frequency of animal trials was contemporaneous with the so-called revival and acceptance of Roman law, with the great codifications of criminal law, and altogether with an ever-increasing coherence of rational systems of law and thought. The basic difficulty lies in the common occidental perception of the relationship between man and nature. Starting with the Bible, both Judaism and Christianity have consistently viewed man as the only creature in God's image and likeness, the only one possessing a reasonable soul, aspiring to salvation and destined for an afterlife. Within the hierarchy of the universe, therefore, man occupies a special place. At creation man was declared lord and master of nature, and this idea was often interpreted as a God-given mandate to utilize nature freely for human benefit. Carried further, the same concept meant that the vegetal and animal kingdom existed solely for man's use. The perception of a universal hierarchy with man at the top of the mortal creation was current in learned circles throughout the middle ages and still accepted as an axiom in the early modern period.29 In this sense, western culture differs radically from other systems of thought that perceive man and animal as existing upon one continuous plane. The American Indian spoke of "his brother the buffalo", the 28 The exact means used are somewhat obscure, as different texts speak interchange- ably of exorcism, excommunication, anathema, adjuration and cursing (maledictio). Often two or more of these terms are used in the same text. The formulae utilized in the actual ceremonies mention most often anathema and adjuration. 29 Thomas, Man and the Natural World, pp. 17-41. 15</page><page sequence="11">Mexican Indian perceived animals as individual soul-mates of each human and the Buddhist saw transmigration of souls between humans and animals as inevitable,30 but European thinkers did their best to mark an impassable boundary between man and beast. Perhaps the most extreme expression of this approach was Descartes's idea, that animals are automata possessing neither sense nor feelings. Within this framework it was inconceivable that a beast should be placed in a human situation and treated as a human being. Animal trials, however, did exactly that. Most nineteenth-century scholars who grappled with the problem solved it in terms of cultural positivism. Animal trials were clearly the legacy of a primitive, superstitious past. This approach provided two specific explanations. The most simplistic viewed the trials as the communal historical equivalent of a child's temper tantrum: "This childish disposition to punish irrational creatures . . . is common to the infancy of individuals and races". The other explanation placed the phenomenon within a "primitive" cultural context that attributed either anthropomorphic or demonic qualities to insensate beasts.31 Neither explanation made any attempt to provide distinct interpre- tations for the two different types of trials, and neither fits the facts. The idea of childish retaliation can hardly be used to describe sentences passed (sometimes after ponderous debates and trials years long) by episcopal courts and parlements, or legal opinions of leading jurists and law faculties.32 The cultural explanations have the merit of placing the phenomenon within its historical context, but their simplistic conflation of two different procedures makes nonsense of 30 J.

Endowing animals with human characteristics, such as reason or malicious intent, can explain secular proceedings against them. Conversely, one could justify ecclesiastical trials in those terms only if indeed they concerned theriomorphic devils rather than flesh-and-blood animals. By failing to distinguish the two types, the positivist historians were guilty of confusing two distinct tradi- tions, and their final explanation fails to cover either phenomenon.33 All positivist interpretations come up against one main stumbling- block: the sequence of events. All sources clearly indicate that animal trials, both secular and ecclesiastical, became common practice in the later middle ages, reaching their peak of frequency and greatest geographic scope during the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and subsequently declining. Those facts were difficult to square with the picture of humanity advancing in linear progression from the superstitious middle ages to the rational nineteenth century. Indeed, one scholar commented in a puzzled fashion that "... strangely enough, it was in the latter half of the seventeenth century, an age of comparative enlightenment, that this cruel penalty seems to have been most frequently inflicted".34 Most of his colleagues, though, were content to telescope the entire European past into one static era of irrationality, thus neatly shelving the problem. In response to the positivist interpretation, J. J. Finkelstein has recently raised an opposite theory. According to him, the trials in no way indicated an anthropomorphic view of the animal kingdom. To the contrary: they were a specific cultural manifestation of a mentality that placed man above animal in the hierarchy of creation and therefore felt obliged to stamp out any infringement of this order, such as the killing of a human being by a lower creature. The practice, therefore, was specific only to the Judaeo-Christian tradition and had no connection with any influences alien to this framework. Such was the horror inspired by the deed, that the Bible was not content to prescribe the stoning of a goring ox, but forbade in addition the consumption of its meat. The latter injunction, Finkelstein pointed out, must have constituted a considerable hardship in nomadic society.35 33 Karl von Amira was the first to insist upon the clear distinction between Tierstrafe (secular trials) and Tierprocesse (ecclesiastical trials). Unfortunately, Evans and Frazer subsequently confused the issue once more by piling the record of one case upon the other in an anecdotal manner. Berkenhoff returned once more to von Amira's distinc- tion, renaming the second category Tierbannung and adding a third one (rechtsrituelle Tiertotung) for the execution of animals involved in bestiality cases. 34 Evans, Criminal Prosecution, p. 138. 35 Finkelstein, The Ox that Gored, pp. 48-72. 17</page><page sequence="13">This explanation does place the trials within a clear cultural context. Unfortunately it is the wrong one. Finkelstein's theory depends upon his failure to find any animal trials outside the Judaeo-Christian tradi- tion, a failure that derives from his strictly occidental concept of the judicial process. In fact many non-literate, non-western societies prose- cuted and punished offending animals, albeit less formally than the Europeans, for their entire judicial structure was conceived in a dif- ferent form. These prosecutions were often based upon a perception of nature that was totally opposed to the western hierarchy of being.36 The idea of animal trials also existed in western culture outside the Judaic tradition, in Plato's writings.37 Finkelstein relied heavily upon the horror inspired by the animal's act, a feeling sufficiently visceral to taint the beast's meat, in order to illustrate the deep-seated character of the hierarchical conception. This repulsion does indeed surface in legal and judicial sources. A bull was sentenced "in detestation of the said crime", a pig executed "in detestation and horror of the said deed". According to one legal opinion, homicidal animals should be executed "in order to erase all memory of the enormity of the deed".38 The feeling that such an animal was unclean, however, seems to have been strongest in antiquity, when the Israelites refused to eat the animal's meat and Plato had the carcass "cast out beyond the borders of the country". By the time medieval animal trials were recorded, the need to obliterate all traces of the horrible crime was reserved for cases of bestiality.39 Moreover the uncleanliness attaching to the animal did not survive the merely homicidal beast's death: biblical injunctions notwithstanding, the meat of executed beasts was often distributed to the town poor in the Low Countries.40 Finkelstein's explanation fits the context of antiquity, not of the middle ages. 36 For a wider view of law in non-literate societies, see Pospisil, Anthropology of Law, pp. 13-18; for evidence of human justice meted out to animals outside Europe, see Berkenhoff, Tierstrafe, pp. 75-83. From his notes, it is obvious that Finkelstein was unaware of Berkenhoff's work. 37 Plato, The Laws, trans. R. G. Bury, 2 vols.

It is clear, however, that no such distinction existed in the minds of medieval legists. According to them, the difference was functional, not causal: pigs or locusts who harmed man must alike stand trial in the interest of universal justice. Where the secular arm could not reach, God's power was invoked to perform the same task. The operative principle underlying both types was identical, so that prece- dents could freely be drawn from one practice in support of the other.41 The theory's great weakness lies in the implicit assumption that historical reality might be inferred from ideological data. As stated above, no such congruence existed even between medieval legal ideology and structure. The gap between ancient precepts and med- ieval judicial reality was even greater. It is impossible to assume that a practice lasting at least five centuries all over Europe could have survived purely on the strength of a biblical precedent, when similar injunctions had ceased to be legally binding over a millennium earlier. Indeed, the Pentateuch served more often as justification than as actual source for behavioural models. The explanation for animal trials must be sought within their actual social and intellectual en- vironment, not in long-defunct legislation.42 Consequently any inter- pretation seeking to establish context, not precedent, must take into account the one factor ignored by the positivists and by Finkelstein alike: the developments occurring in any living judicial process under the influence of one or more cultural traditions. The chronological scope of the problem in itself shows that between the thirteenth and the eighteenth century more than one influence must have formed the mental attitudes behind the trials. Within a developmental scheme it is possible to perceive alternate justification and condemnation of (n. 40 cont.) Benno J.

THE INDICTMENT The earliest extant record of an animal trial is the execution of a pig in 1266 at Fontenay-aux-Roses. Roughly at the same time, early French customals began mentioning the practice. Both types of records indicate by their matter-of-fact fashion of recording the trials that the custom had long been in existence before the appearance of written records. Nevertheless, in this case written judicial record went hand in hand with the first comments upon the practice. Of the two customals mentioning the fact, the Coustumes et stilles de Bour- goigne does no more than prescribe the execution of most homicidal animals. The Coutumes de Beauvaisis, however, adds a scathing criticism to the facts. According to Philippe de Beaumanoir, author of the Coutumes de Beauvaisis, the only justification for the custom lay in the cupidity of seigneurial authorities reluctant to relinquish a profitable source of income. The practice was juridically meaningless and invalid, for all crime presupposes intent, and beasts possessing neither knowledge of good and evil nor malicious intentions could not be held responsible for their actions.43 Philippe de Beaumanoir was a secular intellectual, judge and administrator. Though remarkably learned in both Roman and cus- tomary law, his interests were limited to the purely practical sphere. He was not interested in theoretical speculations concerning the force of human law in nature. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that he should have taken the stand he did. For a leading clergyman to adopt a similar position was more unusual, as the entire argument for animal trials rested upon theological foundations. Yet no less an authority than Thomas Aquinas voiced a strikingly similar opinion concerning ecclesiastical jurisdiction over animals. While Beaumanoir based his argument on the legal concept of intent, Aquinas centred his objec- tions to the anathematizing of harmful pests around the philosophical idea of reason. Animals, defined as insensate and irrational, could 43 For the execution of 1266, see Abbe Jean Lebeuf, Histoire du diocese de Paris, 15 vols.

Generally speaking, Beaumanoir stands out among the customal authors by his organization of the material in judicial categories and his commentaries. 20 NUMBER 110 PAST AND PRESENT</page><page sequence="16">LAW, FOLKLORE AND ANIMAL LORE suffer no guilt for their actions, and consequently no punishment. Curses and anathemas presupposed both the object's culpability and its amenability to punishment. In this case the object's nature voided and nullified the curses. Thus, in the purely philosophical scheme of things, man and animal were separated by the impassable barrier of reason. Aquinas' final argument, however, brings the entire issue back into the realm of theology. Like the rest of creation, animals were God's creatures fulfilling God's will by their actions. Cursing them, therefore, was more than useless: it was blasphemous. Aquinas did acknowledge that noxious animals might be the devil's emissaries rather than God's, but in that case, he pointed out, any anathema or adjuration should be addressed to the willing author of the damage rather than to his unreasoning agents.44 The two comments, secular and ecclesiastical, are roughly contem- porary, but show no evidence of any mutual influence or even awareness. Their near-simultaneous appearance was the expression of a general trend of thirteenth-century elite culture in its relation to popular manifestations in general and to popular conceptions of the animal kingdom in particular. Throughout the later middle ages and the early modern period country folk, far from denying animals any human characteristics, consistently attributed to them both reason and will in direct contradiction to learned opinions.45 Beyond the purely utilitarian sphere, their perceptions were influenced by a long tradition of the fabulous. This tradition, transmitted through the writings of classical authors, was rejected as an expression of paganism during the Carolingian renaissance. It thus became subsequently identified with a popular level of culture and belief. By the twelfth century it had re-emerged into the realm of learning as a result of the "Christian modification and adaptation of ancient substrata".46 The writings of Honorius Augustudunensis, Hildegard of Bingen and Lambert of Saint-Omer abound with animals who either physically or symbolically transcended the realm of the natural. Perhaps the clearest expression of this trend was the revival of the animal lore of the classical Physiologus in the form of several twelfth-century bestiaries. 44 Thomas Aquinas, Summa theologiae, 2nd pt. of 2nd pt., q. 76. 45 Thomas, Man and the Natural World, pp. 75-81; French folklorists have also found animal anthropomorphy a common rural element: "Les gens de campagne, loin de considerer les betes comme simples machines, leur attribuent divers actes qui suppose un raisonnement": Paul Delarue et Marie-Louise Teneze, Le conte populaire franqais, 3 vols. (Paris, 1957-76), iii, p. 31. 46 Claude Lecouteux, "Paganisme, Christianisme et merveilleux", Annales. E.S.C., xxxvii (1982), pp. 712, 715-16. 21</page><page sequence="17">These handbooks of zoology all coupled the physical description of each animal with an allegorical interpretation, making no distinction between horses and unicorns, dogs and basilisks. The natural and the fabulous inhabited the world of twelfth-century zoology in perfect harmony.47 At the same time medieval French literature also incor- porated much fabulous matter concerning not only beasts (like the unicorn), but also beings that magically crossed the borderline be- tween the two realms. Mermaids, women-serpents, werewolves, child-swans and semi-human savages populate the literature of mira- bilia.48 This tradition was reinforced by a rich folkloristic stratum of animal lore common to the entire Indo-European world, abounding with anthropomorphic elements. These appeared in the form of the beast epic, where animals did more than adopt and illustrate human traits; they also followed human legal procedures. The strict imitation of human judicial precedents was especially common in the Roman de Renard, where the clever fox stood trial before King Lion, managing to evade retribution by the use of a legal technicality. The entire text is built around accepted legal customary norms ranging from loyalty and vendetta to fraud and rape, with the camel (the papal legate) supplying the ecclesiastical point of view.49 Other popular literary motifs outside the beast epic reinforced the involvement of animals in the judicial process. One of the most popular of these during the later middle ages and early modern period in France was the so-called dog of Montargis. The legend is based upon a universal motif: the faithful hound who avenges its master's murder. The western medieval version, however, had the dog do so in a formal judicial duel with the murderer. The tale was first written in the twelfth century as a chanson de geste, now lost. In this version 47 Concerning bestiaries, see especially Florence McCulloch, Medieval Latin and French Bestiaries (Chapel Hill, 1962); M. James, "The Bestiary", History, new ser., xvi (1931), pp. 1-11. 48 Daniel Poirion, Le merveilleux dans la litterature franqaise du moyen age (Paris, 1982), pp. 29-30, 110-15. 49 Jean Deroy, "Le discours du chameau, legat papal, dans le Roman de Renard", in Jan Goossens and Timothy Sodmann (eds.), Third International Beast Epic, Fable and Fabliau Colloquium (Cologne, 1981), pp. 102-7. The tale's German version, Reinhart Fuchs, was written as a satire on late twelfth-century imperial justice. More than any other version, this one is entirely built upon judicial situations of lineage loyalty, vendetta and trial. See Sigrid Krause, "Le Reinhart Fuchs, satire de la justice et du droit", in Danielle Buschinger and Andre Crepin (eds.), Comique, satire et parodie dans la tradition renardienne et les fabliaux (Goppingen, 1983), pp. 139-51. For the common Indo-European origins of this tradition, see Joseph Bedier, Les fabliaux: Etudes de litterature populaire et d'histoire litteraire du moyen age, 6th edn. (Paris, 1969). 22 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 110</page><page sequence="18">LAW, FOLKLORE AND ANIMAL LORE both victim and murderer were knights in Charlemagne's court of the epic legends. After its master's murder in the forest, the dog returned alone to the emperor's court, where its continual attacks upon the murderer, coupled with its master's disappearance, excited enough suspicion to warrant verification. The dog was allowed to "prove its accusation" like a man in a duel, where he vanquished the murderer who then confessed the truth and was executed. The story enjoyed considerable popularity and a number of versions and translations during the following centuries. By the sixteenth century popular tradition had so internalized the tale that it transferred the events from Charlemagne's mythical court and time to Charles V's historical court at Montargis in 1371. The verisimilitude and histori- city of the myth were already sufficiently established by the fifteenth century to justify its citation as precedent by Olivier de la Marche in his treatise on duels.50 The tale of the dog of Montargis is therefore remarkable not only for its longevity. It contains absolutely no anthropomorphic, symbolic or fabulous elements, and therein lies its plausibility for the early modern audience. Readers accustomed to seeing flesh-and-blood animals stand trial as a matter of course could easily accept the historicity of a story that placed a dog in another judicial situation. Three centuries earlier, however, before this acceptance had had time to crystallize, the dog of Montargis was considered a myth, not a historical fact. And in the thirteenth century animal motifs that took their subject-matter outside the purely factual realm came under attack by learned elements, both secular and ecclesiastical. The mainstream of thirteenth-century thought was directed towards the consolidation of all knowledge in elitist forms, reflecting a totally hierarchical universe that allowed no mixed categories. Strongly influenced by Aristotelian natural philosophy, the leading thinkers of this trend rejected belief in most extra-natural manifesta- tions inconsistent with the immutable categories of nature. Outside the realm of theology, most of those beliefs were categorized as popular superstitions expressed in fables and myths. The learned elite, not content with the compilation of summae, was dedicated to the eradication of superstitions. The attack was carried beyond academic fulminations into the pulpits by preachers, many of them Dominicans like Thomas Aquinas. One of the main targets of this 50 J. Viscardi, Le chien de Montargis: Etude de folklore juridique (Paris, 1932), pp. 54-67; Olivier de la Marche, Traitez et advis de quelques gentilhommes francois sur les duels et les gages de bataille (Paris, 1586), fos. 8-9. 23</page><page sequence="19">offensive was the fabulous tradition that tended to blur the distinction between human and animal realms. Preachers inveighed against the belief in "mixed beings" - partly man, partly beast - condemning it at best as ignorant superstition and at worst as demonolatry. With the elimination of fabulous creatures, animals were once more firmly relegated to their subordinate position in the hierarchy of the uni- verse.51 The opposition to animal trials in the thirteenth century must therefore be seen against this background of uncompromising anti- popular rationalism. The anthropomorphic mental attitudes per- ceived in those proceedings made them unacceptable to an intellectual elite that rejected any blurring of boundaries between man and beast. But in this field the learned offensive failed. The tradition of animal trials may have had its roots in elements of folklore and paganism, but it was too deeply integrated into institutional legal procedures to be easily eradicated. The continued survival of animal trials must therefore be examined in the context of late medieval judicial develop- ments. THE SECULAR DEFENCE The learned criticism of animal trials in the thirteenth century elicited very little written response by way of apologetics or justification. Neither practitioners nor recorders of practised law at the time were much given to theorizing. Perhaps continued implementation was the most effective retort, and lawmen felt no need for any theoretical underpinnings for a practice hallowed by age and custom. Of all the customary law texts compiled in France during the fourteenth century, only Jean Boutillier's Somme rural, recording the customs of the Tournaisis, mentions and justifies animal trials. Boutillier's frame of reference, however, is singular enough to warrant detailed examination. Under the rubric De la beste tuer homme Boutillier prescribes the execution of killer animals by virtue of the biblical injunction. However, he adds, if the victim was a serf the beast should be spared and its owner pay the serfs lord 30 deniers silver symbolizing the thirty generations that issued from Cham, Noah's cursed son.52 51 J.-C.

This repeated use of the Bible, both literal and allegorical, is unusual enough in legal texts, especially those recording customary law. Some customals did no more than to set down the facts, while others, notably those of Beaumanoir and Boutillier, attempted to impose some order upon their material and provide a commentary on specific articles of custom. In this enterprise they almost invariably relied upon the categories and concepts of Roman, not ancient Judaic law. They also sought their precedents and justifications in the words of Justinian, not of Moses. This departure from usual methods can only be understood within the context of the processes customary law was undergoing in France during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The private redaction of customs began around the middle of the thirteenth century in various areas of northern France, continuing well into the fifteenth century. Most often these collections were of local character, describ- ing the practice of law in a specific area. Most of the pays de droit ecrit possessed such privately written customals by the end of the middle ages. They were written by local baillis, administrators, judges and councillors. Most of these authors possessed legal training in civil law, a fact often evident in their attempts to approximate their material to Roman models. Nevertheless, they were no university professors who occasionally gave an outside opinion. They were practitioners of customary law, in need of a handbook, not of theory.53 The reason for this plethora of customals lies in the paradoxical development of law at the time. While custom was by definition ancient practice, reality saw it undergoing constant modification. There was a variety of factors at work: first and foremost, the growth of royal power and of the concept of the king as lawmaker created a whole body of royal ordinances that could and often did supersede local customs. Beyond legislation, customary law was constantly made and re-made by judicial verdicts, some of them in direct contradiction to the ancient oral custom. It was this fact that prompted Pierre de Fontaines to write the customs of Vermandois. Local judges (n. 52 cont.) also ordained animal executions might date from the first half of the fourteenth century, but they provide nothing beyond the statement of custom. For Boutillier and his influence, see Guido van Dievoet, Jehan Boutillier en de Somme rural (Louvain, 1951). 53 Auguste Lebrun, La coutume: Ses sources - son autorite en droit prive (Paris, 1932), pp. 71-2; Pissard, La connaissance et la preuve des coutumes, pp. 161-3. 25</page><page sequence="21">so far relied upon their opinions and prejudices rather than upon the custom, that "the country is practically devoid of custom".54 In de Fontaines's opinion, it was the ruler's duty to enforce the proper application of ancient unadulterated custom.55 Indeed, Saint Louis concurred in this opinion, for in 1270 he regulated the inquests par turbe whose purpose it was to establish in writing and approve by royal command the exact custom of each locality.56 But even this procedure could result in some modification and adaptation of ancient customs to modern needs. Finally, the continuous growth of Roman and canon law studies inevitably influenced customs. Though all customal authors affirmed that in the pays de droit coutumier Roman law had no power, a statement repeated in royal ordinances as well,57 they consistently quoted Roman matter in their collections, adding to the process of change in their very attempt to preserve. This was done especially in the weaker areas of customary law, such as contract and obligation laws. Similarly, canon law influences modified custom- ary marriage laws in certain parts of France.58 Royal ordinances rarely intervened in such matters, but they had considerable influence upon police and criminal practice. The contradiction between the dynamic changes in custom on the one hand and its emphasis upon constancy on the other hand provide the basis not only for the act of writing, but also the incentive for the search of justification and reason. If custom cannot remain unchanged from times immemorial, it must at least accord with reason and natural law.59 Though no one defined exactly what these terms meant, they were usually connected with either Roman or canon law models. Consequently authors sought whenever possible, not so much to bring customary law in line with Roman maxims but rather to clothe its manifestations in the respectability of Roman terminology. Seen in this light, animal trials presented a rather difficult problem. Not only did Roman law include no such practice, it specifically 54 Pierre de Fontaines, Conseil a un ami, ed. A. J. Marnier (Paris, 1846), ch. 1, art. 3. 55 Ibid., ch. 22, arts. 31-3. 56 Pissard, La connaissance et la preuve des coutumes, pp. 112-58. 57 Ordonnances des rois de France de la troisieme race, ed.

Felix Aubert (Paris, 1909), pp. 5, 20-1, 52, makes it clear that Roman law carried no authority whatsoever in the terra consuetudinaria. 58 Thus in twelfth-century Normandy canon law pressure resulted in the modifica- tion of the customary dotal regime, making women's dowries henceforth inalienable: Lebrun, La coutume, pp. 38-9. 59 For a list of sources stating this requirement, see ibid., pp. 50-1. 26 NUMBER 110 PAST AND PRESENT</page><page sequence="22">LAW, FOLKLORE AND ANIMAL LORE enunciated the principle of Noxae deditio in such cases, stating that the offending animal should be turned over to the injured party. While this principle did assume that the consequences of the deed were to be borne by the offending agency, these consequences were in no way punitive. Rather, the injured party was compensated by a transfer of property. The animal was therefore viewed as a chattel, not a sentient being. In this case, custom was in direct contradiction to the Roman precedent. Significantly, not only was the offending animal often penalized, but even those that were spared were forfeit to the justice, not to the injured party. The element of private compensation was totally lacking in customary law.60 This essential difference between the two systems probably explains the silence of most fourteenth-century customals on the subject.61 The only author to insist upon the legitimacy of animal trials (extremely common in his own jurisdiction) was forced to invoke an even more venerable precedent than Justinian. The Bible provided Boutillier with the best of precedents. However, his subsequent addition concerning serfs indicates, despite biblical attributions, a probable Germanic origin of the custom. The payment of 30 deniers silver is strongly remi- niscent of the 30 solidi of wergild payable for killed serfs in the ancient Burgundian and Salian codes.62 It is no coincidence that those codes were written and used during the early middle ages in the very same area that later saw the first appearance of animal trials. Nor is it chance that they were recorded only in the customals of those same areas, though by the fourteenth century they were rife all over France. The embarrassed silence of most customals had little effect upon continued practice. Animal trials continued to be held even without a Roman precedent. In the following centuries, while Beaumanoir lay forgotten, Boutillier enjoyed great influence and popularity.63 Despite his Roman sympathies, his work and that of other customal writers effectively prevented the introduction of Roman law as the operative code of the realm. Customary law, provided with respect- 60 Corpus iuris civilis, ed. P. Kruger, T. Mommsen and R. Scholl, 3 vols. (Berlin, 1884-95), i, Institutiones 4.9; Digesta 9.1. The English practice of deodand, or surrender of the offending animal to the king, parallels French custom to some extent. Still, it implies once more compensation rather than punishment, and is therefore irrelevant to our argument. 61 It is noteworthy that Beaumanoir, despite his familiarity with and respect for Roman law, did not use it in his condemnation of animal trials. 62 Lex Salica, ed.

Ecclesiastical animal trials raised some of the most crucial points of the Christian view of nature, man and justice. In consequence, the theoretical vindication of these trials appeared in response to their spread during the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Specialists in Roman and canon law devoted long treatises to the subject, citing both biblical prece- dents and scholastic arguments in support of the practice. One of these treatises, Gaspar Bailly's Traite des monitoires, went so far as to describe the exact procedure and argumentation of a purely putative trial.65 Taken in conjunction with contemporary trial records, this literature clearly shows that though ecclesiastical excommunication of animals was known before, its popularity as a common legal recourse dates only from the fifteenth century. This procedure had its cultural and legal roots in a tradition clearly distinct from the secular custom. Though defenders of ecclesiastical trials knew and were prepared to use the secular apologetics whenever convenient, both the increasingly popular practice and theory of the trials belong to a different facet of cultural expression. The learned defence of ecclesiastical animal trials took place during the period usually iden- tified with another trend, namely the persecution of witches. The close parallels between two phenomena, both incorporating religion and legal processes, raise the possibility of crossing influences. The concept of the devil as the enemy of the human race could interact with the idea of animals harming human interests, with a resultant similarity of reaction to both threats. First of all, it is necessary to define the type of witchcraft involved. Kieckhefer, Horsley, and several other students of witch-hunts have noted already the discrepancy between popular beliefs in practical sorcery and learned conceptions of diabolism and devil-worship. The gap was significant mainly during the early stages of the witch-hunts, 64 Rene Filhol, "La redaction des coutumes en France aux XVe et XVI siecles", in J.

Kieckhefer has shown how, a century and a half earlier, people brought in for sorcery ended by confessing to diabolic practices after torture and inquisitorial questioning. The internalization of learned demonology by popular elements was due to the persistent pressure of inquisitorial activity, the results becoming evident especially after the middle of the fifteenth century.66 The influence of the inquisition's questioning methods and ideas is also apparent in the fact that records of early secular witch trials contain far fewer diabolical elements than either contemporary ecclesiastical or later secular cases.67 Consequently, when attempting to draw analogies between witch and animal trials, one cannot consider the entire tradition of witch beliefs. The only possibly relevant parallels to elitist, ecclesiastical judicial proceedings against animals are the elitist, ecclesiastical judicial proceedings against witches.68 Most relevant, of course, are the concepts of animals voiced in these proceedings. There was a clear difference between the learned and the popular perception of the role of animals in witchcraft and sorcery. In cases relating to simple, functional magic, animals assumed an indisputably natural form. Some were used for the making of potions: toads, thanks to their poisonous qualities, came in for frequent mention. Most animals, especially domestic ones, were seen as objects of, not participants in magic acts: cows that gave blood instead of milk, 66 Richard Kieckhefer, European Witch Trials (London, 1976); R.

Theriomorphic devils appeared everywhere in the lore of demonology, from simple witches' familiars to the incarnation of evil spirits. Animals carried witches to their sabbaths, where the devil himself occasionally assumed animal form.69 Did these supernatural animals have any connection with the trials of rats, locusts and eels? The wealth of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century argumentation on the subject has provided several insights into contemporary percep- tions of noxious animals. By this time increasing literacy had extended the scope of written evidence beyond the rarified circles of leading jurists and theologians. By the early modern period it is possible to determine not only the views of theparlement president and the univer- sity professor, but also of the local priest or canon. As might be ex- pected, more varied sources inevitably provide more complex answers. The one point upon which everyone agreed was the harmful character of the animals in question. The reason behind their actions, however, was in doubt. Many bishops assumed that they were often God's emissaries, therefore insisting upon communal penitence be- fore commencing any legal proceedings. The eminent Spanish theo- logian, Martin de Azpilcueta, concurred, pointing out that prayers and fasting were far more efficacious than exorcisms in this case. Conversely, he argued, they might be the devil's agents, in which case the clergy would do better to address the exorcism to the master rather than to his servants.70 Seemingly, Azpilcueta considered the fish near Sorrento (the reason for his opinion) as belonging to the latter category, for he refers to them as "cacodemons". French jurists discussing the subject provide an even more interest- ing approach. Unlike Azpilcueta, neither Chassenee nor Bailly were clergymen or theologians. They were secular jurists who had had occasion to argue before ecclesiastical'courts, but their approach was necessarily different. Both entirely excluded any supernatural agency at work behind the animals' depredations. Animals were insensate and irrational, acting presumably of their own impulses, not the 69 For animals in popular sorcery, see Horsley, "Who Were the Witches?", pp. 697 ff.; Horsley, "Further Reflections on Witchcraft", pp. 84-5.

Nevertheless, both recommended excommunication in the interests of the human race. In the hierarchy of creation, the lower echelons existed for the convenience and utility of man. Just like the homicidal pigs, locusts consuming a harvest destined to feed humans were infringing upon the order of the universe. Thus Chassenee argued that though, in themselves, irrational creatures were not amenable to excommunication, in their relation to man they were, for they had overstepped their boundaries. In a way, this approach was ruthlessly utilitarian and anthropocentric.71 Not all authorities were as consistent. A century earlier when animal trials were gradually becoming more popular, Felix Malleolus of Switzerland offered no argumentation, merely the precedents and procedure of animal exorcism. While the Swiss jurist carefully avoided any mention of demonic powers at work among the animals, his methods are telling. Unlike the French jurists he mentioned neither anathema nor excommunication (which, in a human case, would be utilized against a sinner, not a demonic agent), but exorcism with its diabolic connotations. Though the technical term was used for a variety of procedures, they all retained the basic meaning of the use of divine power by ecclesiastical authority for the purpose of ejecting undesirable, usually demonic elements from their habitat. Formulae of exorcism varied according to place and circumstance, but all exhibited the dominance of spiritual power over its opponents, natural or otherwise.72 While it is doubtful that animal trials borrowed the sentence of exorcism from witchcraft cases, both practices relied in their usage upon the same ecclesiastical-judicial tradition of exorcisms going back to early Christianity. The parallel use of the same ritual of expulsion in both instances suggests a similar perception of both procedures in contemporary minds. This perception can be seen in the fate of Malleolus' works. His two treatises on animal trials, both entitled De exorcismis, were the best known works on the subject in the fifteenth century. Originally they were published in a collection of Malleolus' writings, but towards the end of the sixteenth century they were included in a collection of tractates on witchcraft and demonology published as a companion volume to the Malleus maleficarum.73 The editors of the Malleus 71 Chassen6e, Concilium, fos. 14- 16v; Bailly, Traite des monitoires, in Evans, Criminal Prosecution, pp. 287-306. 72 Felix Malleolus, "Tractatus de exorcismis", fos. 74v-79r; J.

Evidently the connection between the two lay in the procedure of exorcism. Fifteenth-century witch-hunting was more concerned with the destruction of guilty practitioners than with the exorcism of inno- cently possessed victims. By the late sixteenth century exorcisms were becoming more central to the prosecution of witches.74 This fact was reflected not only in the long-lasting popularity of Malleolus' work, but also in the publication of exorcism manuals that shed light both on the practice and upon its application to animals. In the first place, they show almost exactly the same phrasing of exorcism formulae for devils and animals.75 Both adjured their subject in the name of God, the Trinity or the saints to depart from their area of operations (human body, vineyard or lake) and to cause humans no further harm. While the animal exorcisms rarely assumed any de- monic agency to be at work, they did evince the same anthropocentric and utilitarian approach voiced by French jurists. Thus, the exorcism recorded by Maximilian d'Eynatten, an early seventeenth-century canon from Antwerp, adjured the animals to depart "to such places . . . where you shall be unable to harm any of God's servants". If they were the devil's emissaries, they were adjured to self-destruct, so that none would remain "except for those who bring about God's glory and are of use and salvation to humanity". Another exorcism by the same author, applied to animals suffering from demonic possession, forbids the devil access to a certain place "in detriment . . of all things granted by God for the use of human beings".76 74 See Robert Mandrou, Magistrats et sorciers en France au XVIIe siecle (Paris, 1980), pp. 163-79, 251-60. 75 "I adjure you, beetles, who dissipate and destroy the food of men in this place, that you should depart henceforth and go where you can harm nobody" ("Adiuro vos, limaces .. .alimenta hominum dissipantia et corrodentia hoc in territoria . . . ut a dicto territorio . . . dissedatis, et ad loca, in quibus nullis nocere possitis, accedatis . ."): Chassenee, Concilium, fo. 17v; "I conjure you, horrible and abominable spirits who unceasingly occupy and disturb this creature of God, N., in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, to depart immediately and flee this body and divine matter" ("Coniuro vos superscriptos neffandissimos et abominabiles spiritus qui hanc creaturam Dei N. occupare et molestare . .. non cessatis, per patrem, filium, et spiritum sanctum . . . ut statim exeatis et fugiatis de vase isto et plasmate Dei . ."): Hyeronimus Mengus, Flagellum daemonum, in Thesaurus exorcismorum atque coniurationum terribilium (Cologne, 1626), p. 299. 76 "Talia loca . . ubi nullis Dei servis nocere poteritis", "nisi ad gloriam Dei et ad usum et salutem humanum conducibiles", "in detrimentum . . quarumcumque rerum humani utilitati a Deo indultarum": Maximilian d'Eynatten, Manuale exorcism- orum, in Thesaurus, pp. 1201, 1190. 32 NUMBER 110 PAST AND PRESENT</page><page sequence="28">LAW, FOLKLORE AND ANIMAL LORE Exorcism manuals belong to a sphere different from judicial tre- atises. Their authors were usually priests or monks in need of practical information. By the second half of the sixteenth century animal trials, animal possession and demonological lore had become firmly enough entrenched in European perceptions to allow less than erudite sources the expression of an independent attitude. In this case the expression came from Martin of Arles, a modest archdeacon from Pamplona, no legal luminary but a most determined fighter against superstition in all forms. In a scathing condemnation of most popular pseudo- medical and magic practices known to him, Martin rather unex- pectedly approved the conjuring of wolves off domestic animals. He based his argument upon the legitimacy of animal exorcism, which he wrongly attributed to Saint Thomas. According to Martin's read- ing, the Summa theologiae had argued that, as the devil uses animals to cause people harm, it is permissible to use exorcism in order to exclude demonic influences from the animal domain.77 Martin of Arles was a contemporary of Chassenee, but the differ- ence between their attitudes is indicative of the gap separating learned and popular conceptions of animal justice. Significantly, the source in this case is neither folkloristic nor elitist, but intermediate. The Navarrese archdeacon was familiar with contemporary practices, but like other apologists in his position he felt compelled to justify his opinion by quoting an eminent authority. Whether deliberate or not, the misquotation of Saint Thomas indicates the intermediary's need to legitimize practice by means of theory. Martin's legal background was sketchy, to say the least, but his Latin was good enough for book- writing. He was therefore the ideal spokesman for attitudes that even a century earlier would have found expression not in writing, only in practice. Indeed, practice provides the strongest argument for connecting the two phenomena, for they exhibit a correlation of time and space. Both animal and witch trials seem to have become increasingly common in Switzerland and the adjoining French and Italian areas during the fifteenth century, and the coincidence is all the more striking because of the almost total absence of any earlier tradition of secular animal trials in Switzerland.78 Not surprisingly, Switzerland also witnessed the emergence of a hybrid type of process: the trial of an individual animal by a secular court on charges of supernatural 77 Martin de Aries y Andosilla, Tractatus de superstitionibus contra maleficia seu sortilegia quae hodie vigent in orbe terrarum (Rome, 1559), fos. 28r-29r. 78 Cohn, Europe's Inner Demons, pp. 225-6. 33</page><page sequence="29">behaviour. As might be expected, there is no record of such trials before the late fifteenth century, by which time the demonological potential of animals was a well-established idea. In form, they conformed to the secular animal trial tradition; the culprits were invariably individual domestic animals rather than droves of insects or shoals of fish, the trials always ending with the expected execution. In content, however, they represent a divergence from the type of virtue of the non-homicidal charges and the use of the hitherto uncommon witches' pyre for execution. They were definitely infor- med by the ecclesiastical tradition of witch trials, as well as the long tradition of fabulous animals. The most remarkable of these trials was the earliest known case. The execution of a cock in Basle (1474) is clear evidence of the extent to which the theriomorphic perception of devils had served to re- introduce animals into the realm of the supernatural, whence thirt- eenth-century rationalists had tried to expel them. The cock was actually executed for laying an egg; if allowed to hatch, such an egg would produce a basilisk.79 The belief that basilisks were hatched from roosters' eggs goes back over a millennium in learned tradition. It was brought up first by Pliny and Solinus. Subsequently, Isidore of Seville repeated it in the seventh century, Pierre of Beauvais, Pseudo-Hugo of Saint-Victor and Hildegard of Bingen in the twelfth, and Vincent of Beauvais in the thirteenth century.80 Indeed, the last source was familiar to the Basle chronicler who recorded the case, though apparently by then the belief had permeated popular strata as well. Most authorities agreed roughly that the basilisk, a fabulous beast, half cock and half serpent, came out of an egg laid by an aged rooster and hatched by a toad. The conviction that the basilisk exuded poison and killed by look, smell and contact explains the alarm of the Basle authorities. One can see the previously rejected fabulous 79 Johan Gross, Kruzer Bassler Chronik (Basle, 1624), p. 120, recounted the facts according to Hans Knebel, chaplain of the Basle church, who had witnessed the event: Diarium, ed.

Though the belief in the basilisk was age-old, it occurred to no one actually to execute a living cock before the fifteenth century, and the case indicates the degree of integration between legal practice and cultural traditions.81 The existence of an analogous synthesis in the realm of witch trials serves to strengthen the similarity between the two. There is a clear correlation between the various opinions voiced and actions taken about animal trials and the author's status in the socio-cultural scale. While theologians and jurists did their best to keep demonology out of the trials, relying on their philosophical view of justice and the universe for justification, the farther one progresses on the road from theory to practice, the closer becomes the connection between noxious animals and noxious devils. Exorcists applied the same means to both, implying that harm to mankind must originate with its eternal enemy. Judges finally saw some animals not as agents, but as active incarnations of the devil. This progressive demonization of the animal kingdom was contemporary with the generally increas- ing internalization by popular elements of learned demonology. Whether theriomorphic devils first appeared in a witchcraft or in an animal trial matters little. By the sixteenth century they were there as part of one judicial-theological tradition, and they remained part of the European legal scene as long as the witches burned. CONCLUSION Perceptions and uses of justice are excellent mirrors of the mentality of an age. In a purely positive system of law they delineate man's concept of necessary and desirable societal relationships. In an all- inclusive system encompassing also the extra-human world, they reveal man's view of his place within the universal scheme as well. Animal trials belong squarely in the latter type of judicial system. They expressed a perception of law that held sway over the entire universe. The idea that the whole world is subject to God's law runs throughout Christian theology. Thomas Aquinas clearly dist- inguished the mechanical universal law that governed natural pheno- mena and had no moral implications from human, positive law. Even 81 The motif of the cock's eggs is an interesting illustration of the mobility of beliefs between the realms of popular and elite culture. Born as part of a learned tradition, it was transposed via the judicial channel into the level of European peasant beliefs, where it could still be found in the nineteenth century. See E. Rolland, Faune populaire de la France, 12 vols. (Paris, 1877-1915), vi, pp. 84-90. 35</page><page sequence="31">Thomas, though, admitted the existence of an independent concept of equity side by side with law. His less systematic successors, especially those versed more in law than in philosophy and theology, no longer distinguished universal from human law, or equity from them both. They viewed justice as a universal attribute, applicable to all nature. The pre-eminent status of man in creation, which the scholastics used to distance him as far as possible from the rest of nature, became centuries later the basis of the argument for universal justice. If man was to rule nature, he must do so according to the same principles that governed his relationships with fellow humans. This did not mean that animals deserved the same rights as people. They too were subject to the universal law that had placed them below man, and must therefore refrain from harming him. The principle of granting justice "to each his own" operated also beyond the boundaries of humanity. While these ideas were expressly mentioned only in ecclesiastical cases, they were latent also in the secular trials. The strict observance of judicial (not necessarily human) procedure according to the letter of the law carefully exonerated these trials from any appearance of lynching. The animals got their just due. This perception of law is closely tied with the view of man's relationship with God. While man may have possessed the right to judge animals, he did not have it by virtue of his own nature. The regulation of the universe fell squarely within the domain of divine legislation, and any human sentence passed upon animals depended entirely for its validity and force upon divine justice. It gave man an extraordinary power over nature, so that he could even pronounce exorcisms in God's name not only upon animals, but also upon the four physical elements.82 As a rule, this force was granted man for his struggle against supernatural evil, but could also be used to implement universal justice, especially when the two aims converged upon one object. This view was reinforced by popular perceptions of animals that had long attributed to them both anthropomorphic and symbolic characteristics. In the realm of literature fabulous animals possessing supernatural powers for good or for evil interacted with humans, assumed human form and gave birth to human children. Others provided a satire of human behaviour, notably of human justice. In any case animals were neither insensate nor lacking in intent, and 82 Mengus, Flagellum daemonum, pp. 331-5. 36 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 110</page><page sequence="32">LAW, FOLKLORE AND ANIMAL LORE while judges may have based their verdicts on customary law and concepts of universal justice, people witnessing the executions prob- ably saw them as retribution. While this approach was severely criticized in the thirteenth century, it prevailed over powerful attacks mainly because its net result - animal trials - fitted into the scheme of universal justice as early modern intellectuals perceived it. The survival of animal trials, then, was the result of their simultane- ous dependence upon two totally different traditions. Popular anthro- pomorphism and learned ideas of justice met at this juncture. Furthermore, they continued to exist because they fulfilled certain necessary functions. While they settled no disputes and kept no peace, they were important in other ways. They defined man's relationship with the animal kingdom by virtue of his judicial rights over it. They reaffirmed society's self-image as universally just. Finally, the ecclesiastical trials provided the setting for a communal ritual of self and environment purification from inimical forces. The interaction between elite and popular perceptions of animals and justice can be seen outside the court-house as well as in it. The transition of fabulous elements from classical elite culture to early medieval popular beliefs, back to the learned bestiaries and once more via the court-house and the cock's execution into the realm of peasant ideas, shows the impossibility of classing any long-standing tradition as either learned or popular. Once in court, those traditions were bound to interact, influence each other and produce a hybrid tradition, such as the animal trials. In fact, in so far as all legal practice is a cultural phenomenon, it is necessarily an intermediate one. It finds expression in the court-house, where abstract and concrete problems, jurists and litigants converge. The court was a meeting- ground of scholars and simple folk, where learned ideas came into contact and occasional conflict with popular perceptions and tradi- tions. One of the results of this encounter was the animal trials. Ben Gurion University of the Negev Esther Cohen Beer Sheva 37</page></plain_text>
