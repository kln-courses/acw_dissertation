Bragdon, Department of Anthropology, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187. Edward J. Lenik's latest volume on rock art, Making Pictures in Stone: American Indian Rock Art of the Northeast is a supplement to his monumental Picture Rocks: American Indian Rock Art in the Northeast Woodlands (2002). Pursuing a lifelong interest in rock art and its meanings, Lenik visited hundreds of sites, surveyed dozens of museum collections and read the voluminous antiquarian and scholarly literature concerning rock art, focusing on the Eastern Woodlands, much of which was and is occupied by Algonquian-speaking peoples. Along with a non-technical, easy to follow narrative, Lenik provides dozens of photographs and drawings of the many varieties of rock art, including incised and pecked stone designs, and modified stones and boulders. Lenik arranges his material regionally as well as by type, focusing on coastal New England, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Many of the illustra tions reconstruct petroglyphs which no longer survive, based on older photographs and drawings. Lie also includes a number of fascinating anecdotes about rock art study, including commentary from Ezra Stiles, the President of Yale University in the late 18th century, and an early student of Indian "antiquities," and President George Washington, whose experiences as a frontier soldier convinced him that the signs and images on the celebrated Dighton Rock (near Berkeley, Massachusetts), a reproduction of which he was shown at Harvard's museum, must have been made by native people, and not, as it was suggested to him, by ancient visitors from the Middle East. More frustrating are the stories that document the neglect, and outright vandalism that many rock art sites and images have suffered. Several themes emerge from Lenik's book. First, he soundly rejects theories that attribute this art to Europeans (or Chinese or Punic) explorers, finding much evidence to support a Native American origin. Second, he suggests analogies between rock art and art using other media, making a convincing case for the similarities between art on stone and that carved onto living trees, much reported in the 18th and 19th centuries in New England and Virginia. He also argues for interpretations that focus on the "mes sage" of these images, whether it be the richness of Book Reviews fishing, the movement of hunting parties, or direc tions for travel. The most intriguing interpretations of rock art, Lenik believes, are those that link images with shamanistic practice or a belief in soul travel, common among both Algonquian and Iroquoian speaking peoples of the Northeast. The numerous anthropomorphic images found on rock outcrop pings, as well as on the portable pendants, amulets, and sculpture reproduced in the volume, reflect native testimony about the role and function of Manitou, or spirit helpers and other supernatural beings, encoun ters with whom were sought through dream and trance. Lenik has not identified a lexicon of rock art signs and symbols, which would be a challenging task, and has little to say about the possible interpretations of other frequent elements of rock art, including incised lines, cup holes, and other non figurative signs. In other regions these seemingly random markings have been shown to have signifi cance, for example, as counting signs or other mnemonic devices. Also missing from this volume is any clear discussion of the scientific or art historical evidence for the dating of the petroglyphs, and thus, whether they changed in form or meaning through time. These are difficult matters, but by providing those interested with well-documented images of rock art from the Northeast and information about their provenance, Edward Lenik takes petroglyph studies another step forward.
