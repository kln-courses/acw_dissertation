Introduction Since the time of Plato and the Sophists, of number of scholars in the western world have essayed to define specula- tively the genuine nature and function of mythology as a product of man's cul- ture. Having taken diverse perspectives and employed different methods of ap- proaches in their studies, they have pos- tulated a number of theories. In spite of divergence of opinions and conclusions, however, they have reached a unanimous agreement on one fact: that the myth is a universal and traditional cultural pro- duct. The history of mythological theory seems to show that these scholars have adhered to either of two approaches in their study of myths; namely, the litera- ry and the symbolic. Ethnologists seem to be inclined towards the interpretation of myths as a literal expression of "pri- mitive" thought although they themselves differ in their evaluation of myth as a</page><page sequence="2">JANUARY- APRIL, 1963 131 cultural product.1 While evolutionists like E. Tylor have considered myths as a mode of explaining natural as well as socio- cultural phenomena which was later su- perseded by scientific method,2 functio- nalists evolutionists like Bronislaw Ma- linowski have evaluated myths in terms of their function in resolving critical problems which affect social welfare.3 Myths, to the members of this group of pragmatists, are also instruments in the validation of institutions and rites, and are therefore rationalizations for es- tablished social facts.4 On the other hand, a number of idea- listic philosophers and theologians have shown a tendency to interpret myths symbolically, as representations of trans- cedental truths although they hold dif- ferent opinions regarding the nature of the truths symbolized.5 To the "symbo- lists" also belong the members of the so-called "psychological school' who have been influenced by the psycho-analytical theory of Carl Gustav Jung.6 Worthy of special mention among these are Mircea Eliade and Ad. E. Jensen. The former is the exponent of the theory on the ori- gin of myths from the desire of man to suspend the profane time and to return to eternity,7 while the latter postulates the mythical origin of cults.8 In Europe and America today an in- creasing number of scholars, refusing to adhere strongly to any of the theories and approaches just enumerated, collect and analyze myths for ethnographic in- terpretations and ethnohistorical recons- 1 Thomas Sebeok, editor, Myth : A Sympo- sium ( Bloomington : Indiana University, 1958), p. 12. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. * Ibid., p. 13. 6 Ibid. 7 Mircea Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Re- ligion (London: Sheed and Ward, 1958), pp. 1-36. 8 Ad.

This approach is especially employed in the study of the cultures of preliterates who possess very little written sources if any at all. The writer of this paper essays to ana- lyze and describe myths of a Philippine cultural minority for ethnographic inter- pretations and to find out actual and pos- sible relationships such narratives bear with certain socio-cultural phenomena in the social life of the ethnic group. This study, it must be understood, is only a preliminary attempt towards gaining a deeper insight of the culture of a group whose social amelioration and assimila- tion into modern Philippine society are concerns entailed in the colossal task of nation-building. This writer has used the mythological texts collected and transcribed by John Garvan in the 1920's9 and Miguel Ma- dido in 1950, 10 as materials for his eth- nographic interpretations. Although the materials may not be comprehensive, they nevertheless seem to be sufficient for this brief preliminary study. II. Some Features of Manobo Culture as Reflected in Mythology A. Mythological Deities and Heroes 1. The complexity of the Manobo pantheon. Manobo mythology presents a complex hierarchy of divinities and demi- gods active in nature and influential in man's social life. While some of them are personified cosmic forces, others are ap- parently traditional guardians of tribal norms. Among the most popular of these 9 John Garvan, The Manobos of Mindanao (Washington: United States Government Print- ins Office, 1931) 265 p. 10 Miguel Matildo, "A Study of the So- cio-Economic, Religious, and Educational Con- ditions of the Manobos of Agusan" (Unpublish- ed master's thesis, University of San Carlos, Ce- b√∫ City, 1953).</page><page sequence="3">132 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW deities and spirits are Dagau or Makali - dung (the creator of the world), Tagbu- saw (the god of war of whom the baganis are chosen favorites), Tagabayao (the goddess of love and wife of Tagbusau ), Kakaiadan (the goddess of the rice), Ani - tan (the guardian of some animals and the goddess of thunder and lightning), Inaiyan (the goddess of the weather) Suguidon (the god of the chase), Ibu (the goddess of the afterworld), and Yumud (the water wraith).11 In addition to these more clearly identified figures there are also several groups of spirits such as the Tagb anuas (forest spirits), the Diwata (benignant spirits), and the Panaiyang (assistants of Tagbusau), which are apparently seldom presented as characters in myths.12 2. The anthropomorphic concept of deities and heroes. The Manobos attribute human characteristics to deities in myths and apparently also in religion. They see these beings in the background of their own culture, and deities and heroes exhibit the same patterns of behaviour as the Manobos themselves. This con- cept is clearly manifested in Manobo myths. 3. The localization of the residences of deities and heroes. The Manobos ascribe places of residence to mythological fig- ures as well as deities of the pantheon. The personified natural forces dwell in the cosmic regions which are their realms while local deities inhabit different pla- ces in the land of the Manobos. 4. The belief in the existence of divine guardians of plant and animal life. In Manobo mythology and religion there is a prevailing concept that certain spirits exist who guard and protect certain plants and animals from destruction and distur- bance. While the plants and trees are believed to be the abodes of spirits, the 11 Garvan, op. cit., pp. 191-192. 12 Ibid. animals are said to be their pets. Con- sequently, any act of disrespect or distur- bance as well as destruction committed by the Manobo against sacred plants and guarded animals would incur the wrath and expedient punishment of the spirits the severity of which depends on the gravity of the crime. The Story of Anggo, the Petrified Manobo, for example, illustrates the belief just men- tioned.13 In the tale the hero is changed to stone together with the members of his family after he speaks insolently to a group of croaking frogs, an act which displeases the spirit of Anitan. 5. The belief in the existence of a bird-soul or soul-bird. The belief in the existence of a bird-soul (i.e. the soul in the form of a bird) and a soul-bird (i.e. a co-existent double of an individual) is a feature of Manobo religion which has found expression in myths. The motif of the soul-bird or bird-soul (E 732) 14 is the narrative parallel of this belief. It is interesting to note that such a motif or such a belief is not confined to Manobo culture but is a widespread cultural ele- ment especially among the Greeks, Irish, Icelanders, Finnish, Siberians, Egyptians, Jews, Indians, Japanese, Marquesans, etc. In Manobo mythology and belief the soul assumes the form of a turtle dove, and of no other bird, a motif or a belief po- pular among the Irish, Swiss, Spanish, Russians, and Jews. In Stith Thompson's Motif Index the motif is classified as E 732.15 B. Social Statuses Reflected in Ma- nobo Myths 1. The subordinate status of the wife in the family. The consideration of the wife's status as subordinate to that of her 13 Ibid., p. 228. 14 Stith Thompson, editor, Motif Index of Folk Literature, Vol. 2 ( Bloomington : Indiana University Press, 1956), p. 501 ff. 15 Ibid.</page><page sequence="4">JANUARY-APRIL, 1963 133 husband is lucidly manifested in such myths as the Tale of the Origin of the Stars and Explanation of Sunset and Sun- rise.16 Apparently, in times of domestic harmony the wife is regarded as her husband's peer, but in times of conflict she is reminded of her inferiority with the terms mang-gad (chattel) and bino- tong (purchased slave). It is possible that this attitude towards the wife has origi- nated from the marriage payment given by her husband to his father-in-law be- fore the wedding.17 2. The divine nature of the office of the bailan or priest. In some Manobo myths the esteem with which the people regard the village bailan or priest is clearly reflected. In such narratives as The Bailan and the Busau18 the priest's position is considered exalted because of the divine patronage he enjoys. C . Acculturation as Reflected in Ma- nobo Myths. In the myths collected and transcribed by John Garvan and Miguel Matildo se- veral motifs and features are apparent which point out the process of accultu- ration the Manobos have undergone, on account of their frequent contacts with the Christian Filipinos and Spaniards. Ill . Ethnographic Interpretations and Evaluation of the Social Significance of Manobo Myths A. Functionalistic Interpretation and Evaluation From the functionalistic point of view the motifs of the Manobo myths which have just been described are justifica- tions for the existence of social values, patterns of behavior, statuses, institutions, beliefs, and customs. The multitude of benevolent and malevolent spirits are 16 Garvan, op. cit ., 225 ff. 17 Ibid. 18 Matildo, op. cit., p. 70 f. images formed to explain the multiplicity and complexity of Manobo rites de pas- sage. The functionalist may go as far as saying that these are only "excuses" of the Manobos to celebrate or that in times of failure the belief that such failures have been caused by the dis- pleasure of the gods is an "opiate" to re- lieve themselves of disappointment and chagrin. The anthropomorphic concept of the gods may be of social and economic significance to the conservative Mano- bos. The desire to please deities in or- der to attain success in all undertakings may lead to the impoverishment of Ma- nobo believers, and in times of crisis it may drive them to desperation, to the point of offering human sacrifices.19 The belief in the localization of the residence of deities and spirits may be considered as a serious obstacle towards the unification of the Manobos, either spiritually or politically. If the tribal community is believed to be theocratic, this impediment may be even more dif- ficult to remove. A strong belief in the existence of di- vine guardians of certain plants and ani- mals among conservative Manobos may be of ecological significance. In their fear of the guardians' displeasure the Manobos may refuse to destroy plant and animal life which is detrimental to their health, welfare, and progress. They may refuse, for example, to cut down balete (ficus stipulesa) trees in clear- ing their land, or to kill mice and croc- odiles. The functionalist may be inclined to believe that the motif reflecting the su- bordinate nature of a wife's status is a mere excuse in the men's desire to make their status in the home more secure. 19 Garvan, op. cit., pp. 214-215.</page><page sequence="5">134 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW B. A Philosophical and Theological Evaluation From the philosophical or theological point of view the motifs and features of the Manobo myths may be consi- dered as symbols of universal archetypes and primordial images. They may be representations of transcedental truths re- vealed to the Manobos but by them the members of the ethnic group conform to universal norms and patterns of con- duct. The beliefs reflected in the myths, the social values the narratives empha- size are by no means confined to the Manobos but exist among peoples in all parts of the world. Conclusion This preliminary study has shown that the myths of the Manobos of Agusan bear motifs which correspond to certain beliefs, customs, traditions, and observ- ances. The formation of such motifs may either be the cause of the establishment of parallel features in socio-cultural phe- nomena in Manobo society or it may be the reverse. The parallels in Manobo mythology and religion indicate the close relationships the two spheres of culture bear. There- fore, it may be inferred that among con- servative Manobos myths are not only autonomous forms of artistic expression, but also oral traditions which are pre- served by members of the ethnic group for the following values they bear: 1. As validations of established social facts, 2. As instruments of social control, es- pecially among the young, 3. As instruments of cultural transmis- sion. In order to gain a broader understand- ing of the culture and history of the Manobos, it would be very commend- able to collect and analyze their oral traditions which are either being slow- ly forgotten by Manobos of the new ge- nerations or superseded by new motifs resulting from acculturation.
