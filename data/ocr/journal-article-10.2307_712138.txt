<plain_text><page sequence="1">194 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW plan, sidestepping the problem of the relationship between the gods and an overriding 'fate' which has loomed so large in critical literature on the poem. So, too, it is assumed, without adequate argument, that the actions of other gods and goddesses can be traced back to Zeus: his 'goading' of Hera and Athena at the beginning of Iliad 4, for example, is said to make him 'ultimately responsible' for the breaking of the truce (against the more obvious interpretation, that he simply gives in to Hera). The chapter on the Odyssey is better, though here again the relationship between Zeus and the other gods is over-simplified. Here, too, A. would have benefited from a closer study of recent critical literature, particularly in his rather literal-minded discussion of the role of Penelope in the latter part of the poem. The chapter has interesting-though not wholly original-things to say about tensions between heroism and domesticity, 'spiritedness' and prudence in the epic and its hero; but the underlying assumption that Zeus is out to 'provide a lesson for gods and humans' fails to convince. The last two chapters, both devoted to the Aeneid, are by far the best part of the book. A.'s discussion here is much more rigorous and systematic. and he finally makes some attempt to relate his interpretation of the poem to ancient theories of government. His main thesis is that the poem can be read as a kind of meditation on the Platonic conception of the tripartite soul. In particular, Virgil is concerned with the relationship between 'spiritedness' and bodily desire (on the one hand) and reason (on the other): can spiritedness ever be wholly subordinated to reason? On the divine level, this theme is worked out through the relationships between Jupiter (reason), Juno (spiritedness), and Venus (desire); on the human, through conflicts within Aeneas himself, and in his relations with Dido and Turnus; and on the political plane, reflected in the opposing demands of individual liberty and pax Romana. In outline, this line of interpretation is suggestive if somewhat schematic, and may well have more to offer than tired arguments about whether Aeneas succeeds or fails as a Stoic hero. But once again, the detailed working-out is often confused and unconvincing. A. tends to equivocate, for example, as to whether pietas should or should not be equated with reason, as to whether Jupiter should be regarded as a mere symbol or as a 'real' anthropomorphic god, and so on. The argument would have been clarified by the inclusion of a more systematic discussion of the status of Virgil's gods (and, yet again, by some consideration of recent studies, particularly Feeney's The Gods in Epic [Oxford, 1991], which is not even mentioned; it is symptomatic that an article published in 1972 is referred to as 'recent'!). The reader who is put off by the disorganized and tortuous course of the argument (not to mention the lack of an adequate index) is likely to be further discouraged by the style of A.'s prose, which is ponderous and often inelegant. The volume is also marred by a very large number of errors in Latin and Greek words and quotations (phthonis, campi lugenti, numerous inaccuracies in accentuation). Ultimately, this is a book which promises much but fails, by and large, to deliver. A. certainly has some interesting ideas; but his lack of methodological rigour, clarity of exposition, and familiarity with recent scholarship are shortcomings which cannot easily be overlooked.

Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 1995. ISBN: 84-00-07516-1. This is the third Euripidean volume to appear in the Alma Mater series of Greek and Latin texts, of which A. and de C. are respectively director and secretary. The two plays included, Med. and Hipp., make a better thematic pairing than those in the earlier volumes: Alc. and Andr. (I, 1955, 2nd edn 1982); and Ba. and Hec. (II, 1960). This volume can also draw on more recent textual study, especially that of Barrett (introduction in Euripides. Hippolytus, ed. and comm., Oxford, 1964) and of Diggle (OCT, replacement of Murray, complete with Vol. III in 1994; Med. and Hipp. are both in Vol. I, 1984). Med.: A.'s text is very conservative, with square brackets thin on the ground. It ought to be used in conjunction with his article, 'Notas criticas a Euripides, Medea', Emerita 61 (1993), 241-66. A.'s apparatus quite usefully sunmarizes earlier editorial preferences (especially of van ? Oxford University Press, 1997</page><page sequence="2">195 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Looy and of Diggle) as well as attributing emendations, deletions etc. to their originators. The translation is in rhythmic prose (for dialogue) and verse (for lyrics). Stage directions are incorporated. The introduction ranges over the myth and literary antecedents; plot construction; the contemporary and perennial appeal of the play; and concludes with a plot synopsis. The notes, numbered consecutively (eighty-seven in all), are very brief. Most relate to A.'s textual decisions, especially to reinstatement of lines deleted by others, but there are notes also of a factual, somewhat facile, nature on personages in the myth (Argonauts, n. 1); geographical background (Symplegades, n. 2); and gods (Hekate, n. 26; Hermes, n. 47; Hades, n. 60; Pan, n. 68). Aspects of language and style are largely disregarded (but see on simile, n. 21). There is one bizarre aberration, the statement that 'Fedra es hija de Piteo', n. 42. Hipp.: A similar layout is followed. The introduction considers the 'Potiphar' motif; the setting at Troezen; related plays (Euripides' earlier Hipp. and Sophocles' Phaidra); the 'psychological' nature of the drama. In the plot synopsis, the second episode (pp. 565-731) is misleadingly described as 'Tenso dialogo entra Fedra e Hipolito'-belied by the stage directions ad loc., 114-15 (and cf. n. 34). The notes, fewer than A.'s (sixty-nine in all), are broadly similar in content (text, topography, deities, mythological background), but somewhat more discursive. Some bibliographical references are introduced and several problems in interpretation are addressed (n. 5 on aidos; n. 55 on the masculine and feminine genders in the third stasimon); but constraints of space impose penalties (n. 22 seems to imply Theseus was a bigamist, and n. 50 is unhelpful on Orphism). Both plays are prefaced by full bibliographies (where I noticed many misprints, some unfortunate, e.g. Segal's 'imagery' becomes 'imaginary'). Both scholars have provided new variorum editions of the text, accompanied by readable translations, basic introductions, and brief notes. This meritorious task requires more self-discipline in selection and suppression of material than is often recognized by those who have not submitted to it. University of St Andrews E. M. CRAIK M.

ISBN: 0-85668-623-9 (0-85668-624-7). This addition to the series exhibits the usual format, that is to say updated general introduction by Shirley Barlow and updated bibliography by the general editor followed by a brief bibliography of the play in question. These items enclose an introduction to the play, a text based on Diggle's with brief English apparatus, and a translation en face accompanied by a commentary based on English lemmata (in the commentary I am not too happy with L.'s use of the term 'act' to describe the parts of the play which are not choral odes). L.'s translation seems to me both accurate and helpful. L.'s commentary is very brief, even minimalist, and perhaps he has been too scrupulous in adhering to the guidelines of the series when others have been more self-indulgent. When he does comment, however, his comments are to the point and informative. Commentators in this series tend to lay themselves open to the reviewer's cliche-charge that they are assuming that their readership has access to a 'well-stocked library', and L. is no exception. When examined, however, his choice of secondary reference proves to be highly judicious and gives evidence of an exemplary knowledge of recent literature. Anyone working on Greek tragedy and, in particular, Euripidean tragedy will need to consult this volume. A few detailed points to end with.
