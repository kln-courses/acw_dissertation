<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY Summary : In Germany several important books have recently been published, and several interesting conferences have been held. Among the publications which are here surveyed are Personal Presentations of Contemporary Philosophy, by a group of prominent philosophers; Contemporary German Philosophy of Value, by August Messer ; On the Battlefield of Logic, by Joseph Geyser ; together with numbers of two periodicals?Annals of Philosophy and International Philosophical News. The sixth volume has just been added to a series of books edited by Raymond Schmidt, entitled Personal Presentations of Contemporary Philo? sophy.1 The present volume contains six contributions; the five preceding ones each contained seven or eight, and the series is by no means at an end. These facts enable one to realize the wide scope of German philosophical activity. Very many different types of philosophy are represented. Space is devoted to the life of each contributor: one reads about his special interests and sees his philosophy in its development; one finds out whether he studied the natural sciences, what philosophers past and present appealed to him most?all the influences which helped to shape his work. Some of the contributors speak of metaphysics as subjectively tinged, and these volumes do not help to convince one of the reverse. Among the contributors to the sixth volume is William Stern, psychologist as well as philosopher, and now director of the Psychological Institute at Hamburg University. He writes that.in his student days in Berlin, towards the end of last century, he was struck with the atrophy of philosophy. From an early age he intended to devote himself to the development of a philosophical Weltanschauung, the need for which he con? sidered to be the most urgent demand of the time. His philosophical development was connected with his psychological work, and in the main uninfluenced by other philosophers. Stern contributed a great deal to child-psychology and the various forms of applied psychology. He became particularly interested in the problems of intelligence and its testing. He also concerned himself with what he called " differential" psychology. This makes narrower generalizations than " general" psychology, and often approaches close to the method of history. He says explicitly that psychology cannot perform the function of metaphysics. His main philosophical con? clusions are contained in the three volumes of Person and Thing,* and he names his system " Critical Personalism." He regards metaphysics as the critical search for a theory of being and 1 Philosophie der Gegenwart in Selbstdarstellungen. Leipzig: Felix Meiner. Vol. vi, 1927. Pp. 227.

Every metaphysical system is simply a resting-place in the search. The need for a philosophical Weltanschauung is the need for unity. The dualism to be overcome is that of teleology and mechanism, and he claims to overcome it through the new alternative Person-Thing. " Person " is the fundamental category. A person is a multiple unity with purposeful activity. Everything that truly is, is a person. But as a person is " psycho- physically neutral," this contention is not anthropomorphic?a person may or may not be a human being. The world is understood through " hypos- tasis," but this is no return to nalve personification. It is the relating of all non-personal, and therefore only apparent, unities to real wholes?to persons, in which they are merged. An apparent unity is a " thing/' an aggregate which obeys mechanical laws. Things and their laws are deducible from persons, hence there is no dualism. The world is a hierarchy of persons; and from the more fundamental point of view of value, it is a hierarchy of ends in themselves. At the top of the hierarchy is the divine " All-Person." (Stern's treatment of value is considered below in con? nection with Messer's book on the philosophy of value.) Johannes Reinke, an opponent of biological mechanism, is another contributor to this volume. Unlike Stern, he found philosophy little to his taste in early years. It was indeed a physical weakness, which hindered such practical work as looking through a microscope, that led him from practical work to theoretical biology and thence to Weltanschauung. His main interests for many years were botany and politics. However, after the appearance of The World as Deed,1 he was " hailed as a philosopher by real philosophers/' He found the natural philosophy of Bergson " fan- tastic," that of Schopenhauer " full of contradictions.'' The natural scientist, says Reinke, cannot be satisfied with a mere collection of observed facts. But he cannot expect certain knowledge when he goes beyond them?almost every generalization is no more than a hypothesis. While physics contains some knowledge and a great deal of belief, metaphysics is purely a matter of belief. In biology his studies convinced him that analysis of the simplest event in a cell leaves a remainder which no physical methods can explain. He therefore formulated the theory of " dominants." Vital occurrences involve three kinds of force?energetic force, which is quantitative ; diaphysic force, to which the dominants belong ; and, thirdly, psychic force. The dominants are the immanent causes of specific form? determining, for example, one plant egg to become a lily, another to become an oak. From the scientific standpoint, he regards the original vital cells as simply " given " ; but as a natural philosopher, he believes them to be " created " by transcendent Force. Eugen Kuhnemann, known for his work on Heider, Schiller, and Kant, speaks about his work in America. There are two contributions on Kant from P. E. Liljeqvist and G. Rensi respectively. The remaining con? tributor is Bernardino Varisco, an Italian idealist. The periodical Annals of Philosophy * published last September a number celebrating Hans Vaihinger's seventy-fifth birthday. This philosopher, 1 Die Welt als Tat. Umrisse einer Weltansicht auf naturwissenschaftlicher Grundlage. Berlin: Paetel. 1925 (7th ed.). * Annalen der Philosophie und philosophischen Kritik.

He there describes the develop? ment of his philosophical beliefs. He was struck at an early stage with the want of attention paid to the Irrational. He found the Hegelian influence predominant; the ideal of philosophy was to explain everything in terms of logical conclusions. He himself was most affected by Kant and Schopenhauer, and combined the former's view that metaphysical knowledge was impossible with the latter's view that thought was sub- servient to action. Thought, he believes, though only a means to practical life, has, in accordance with the " law of the growth of means over ends," detached itself from its end and is practised for its own sake. As a result it has set itself tasks which it is quite unable to perform. The inability lies not merely in human thought, but in thought as such. The proper attitude to unanswerable questions (as the purpose or cause of existence) is to trace the causes which account for their being asked. Thought is quite justified in making use of suppositions which it knows to be false. These creations of thought are scientific fictions, and the resultant ' as-if' world of irreality is far more important for ethics and aesthetics than the real world. A fiction should be distinguished from a hypothesis?the latter may be verified, the former is known to be false. Vaihinger denies that his philosophy is sceptical, since, far from displaying doubt, it denies the reality of certain things on the ground of certain facts. He names his theory " idealistic positivism/' and Annals of Philosophy was founded in 1919 in order to spread and develop it. Among articles in the September number of Annals of Philosophy is one by A. Nyman called " Einstein?Bergson?Vaihinger." He considers rela? tivity as interpreted in terms of Vaihinger's philosophy. Bergson and several German philosophers (for example Oskar Kraus and Julius Schultz, who also contributes an article to this number) consider that the relativists are constantly making use of " fictions "?such as multiple-times and the four-dimensional world. They do not, however, know this, says Kraus, and think they are dealing with facts. Their thinking follows Vaihinger's " Law of Displacement of Ideas," whereby helpful suggestions become falsely accepted as facts. Nyman considers that both the special and the general theory of relativity exemplify Vaihinger's "Method of the Double Fault," by which, roughly, one fault is corrected by another. Paul Quittel, in another article, maintains that as the reality of objective values and a non-mechanical explanation of life can be neither proved nor disproved, we are at liberty to act as-if they were established. In the concluding article Ludwig von Bertalanffy criticizes Spengler's belief that Western science having reached its end is giving place to pre- cultural credulity. In the Introduction to his book, Contemporary German Philosophy of Value* August Messer emphasizes the importance of distinguishing 1 Die Philosophie des Als-Ob.

The book is in the main a detailed exposition of four philosophies of value. All the philosophers chosen claim to believe in absolute values, but are not so unanimous concerning their independence of consciousness. The first philosopher to be considered is Max Scheler, author of Formalism in Ethics and Material Laws of Value.1 He belongs to the phenomenological school of Husserl, and much of the section devoted to him is concerned with the phenomenological method. Scheler agrees with Kant in rejecting an ethics which reaches its propositions through induction. Ethical judgments are a priori and seen by intuition to be self-evident. Whether anyone thinks them or whether they apply to anything is quite irrelevant to their truth. Phenomenologists speak of the contents of intuition as phenomena or essences; thus they do not use the term " phenomenon " in its more usual meaning of " mere appearance." The facts which the phenomenological method discovers are taken to be given to consciousness, not constructed by it. The belief that facts may be both known in an a priori manner and independent of consciousness is funda? mental to the phenomenologists and distinguishes them sharply from idealists. Scheler thinks there can bea" pure " theory of value (axiology), just as there can be a pure logic. This contains propositions which apply to all values whatsoever. The exposition is concluded by examples of a priori value propositions, e.g., that personal values are higher than thing values, and that the realization of another's good is higher than that of one's own. Messer next considers the idealist theory of Rickert. Both he and Munsterberg believe in the need for systematizing values. Rickert believes one can prove the objective validity of truth as a value, because its very denial implies it. And though one cannot prove the objective validity of other values, he is firmly convinced of their importance. He believes that the material required for the system of values is obtained by induction? through history, but that the actual systematization is not inductive. Since, however, the material is given by history, the system must be " open " ?future cultural development may reveal new material. Hugo Munsterberg, unlike Rickert, tries in his Philosophy of Value? to construct a closed system of values. He thinks one can accept the reality of absolute values. For though human desires only give evidence of con? ditioned values (conditioned by the fact of their being desired), the belief in a world gives the required evidence of absolute values. The belief in a world, as distinct from a series of subjective appearances (and we are bound to believe in such a world), entails the reality of absolute values, though " absolute " is compatible with " determined by conditions of consciousness." The fundamental relation between the human will and values is neither " must" nor " ought." It consists in impersonal, or rather super-personal, volition. Our volition that there should be a world is an impersonal volition?it is not related to personal pleasure or pain. Munsterberg then 1 Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die materiale Wertethik.

Price RM. 12. 89</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES proceeds to define the independent character of the world, as thus imper- sonally willed, in terms of identity between experiences?a definition which gives him the key to his whole system. Messer then considers William Stern, who regards metaphysical faith as the condition of all knowledge and as involving a belief in values. In evaluating, the self, he thinks, gives evidence of its own value as an end. Bearers of value are divisible into ends in themselves (Selbstwerte) and those that derive their value from those ends (Fremdwerte). The latter class is divisible into constituents of ends in themselves (Strahlwerte)?e.g., know? ledge, love?and means to ends (Dienstwerte)?e.g., money, property. Stern does not believe, as does Scheler, that the rank of a value is immediately intuitable. It must be judged by reference to a principle which varies with the class to which the value belongs. The inquiry into true value, for Stern, is also the inquiry into true being, and it is in discussions of value that the grounds for his theory of the hierarchy of " persons " are to be found. The survey concludes with critical remarks which approximate more to obiter dicta than to a systematic examination. Messer thinks that the phenomenological method, as an analysis of the meaning of words, is not only very important, but used by philosophers, e.g., Rickert and Miinsterberg, who do not explicitly acknowledge it. Its claim to make a priori propositions is quite justified because it deals primarily with conventionally assigned meanings. On the other hand, he thinks that knowledge of the different kinds of value must first be given in experience, and every philosopher has to submit to this condition. Among factors responsible for a sceptical attitude towards absolute values he finds the mistaken belief that if a value-judgment is objective it must be such that any one could make it; the confusion between existence and value; and the fact that neither the reality of values nor their rank can be logically proved. Among remaining criticisms is a needed reference to Munsterberg's unsatisfactory use of identity. On the Battlefield of Logic,1 by Joseph Geyser, is another interesting book. It is a criticism of idealism from a realist point of view. There are both many realists and many idealists in Germany to-day. The form of idealism especially strong is Neo-Kantianism, or transcendental idealism. It purports to have grappled with and overcome the difficulties involved in Kant's own theory, It is this form of idealism in particular, and as represented by Bruno Bauch, that Geyser criticizes. Here, as in many other cases, the choice of an opponent is a tribute to his strength. Geyser believes that Bauch's exposition of Neo-Kantianism is the most thorough and plausible. And as it is interesting to know the attitude of a German realist to German idealism, Geyser's criticisms may be given in some detail. Geyser opens with a brief indication of his own usage of such epistemo? logical terms as " fact," " judgment," and " concept." After saying that truth is by far the most important property of knowing, he defines it as correspondence between the contents of knowing and the objective fact to which they refer. He then produces another definition, which is accepted, he says, by the Neo-Kantians?namely, correspondence between thoughts and the laws of thought. The Kantians and Neo-Kantians regard know? ledge as universal and necessary. Hence, by " laws of thought" they do not mean psychological laws, but thought contents which condition all 1 Aufdem Kampffelde der Logik. Freiburgi. B.: Herder. 1926. Pp. 288. Price RM. 6.20. 90</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY knowledge and are not themselves true in the sense in which other thoughts may be true. There is, however, a theory prevalent in Germany which uses this definition and yet does consider laws of thought as psychological laws by which human beings think. This is Psychologismus, which implies views concerning knowledge very different from those held by the Kantians : it implies that knowledge is neither universal nor logically necessary. There may be beings, says Geyser, to whose thinking the law of contradiction does not apply; thus, on the psychologistic hypothesis, it is possible that the same thing should both be and not be. He then criticizes Kant, the main point being Kant's failure to show that the data given to sense are in fact a mere manifold synthesized by mind-dependent principles. Geyser's consideration of Bauch is divided into two main parts, the first concerned with the concept and judgment, the second with sense-experience. He discusses two main points in Bauch's view of the concept (Begriff). (i) First, he attacks his contention that the " abstraction " theory of the concept should be replaced by a " functional" theory. Geyser considers that Bauch's criticisms of the abstraction theory miss the mark. Realists believe that concepts are abstracted in that certain more specific properties are not attended to (e.g., in attending to the concept " animal" one does not attend to the properties which distinguish animals from each other). Bauch, he thinks, wrongly supposes that to abstract a concept is to deny the reality of its relations to these more specific properties. (ii) Secondly, in opposition to Bauch, Geyser asserts that concepts are dependent on human thinking. The concept should be distinguished from its object, an essentiality (Wesenheit), which is not dependent. An essentiality is either intuited in sense-given material or constructed out of what is thus intuited. Geyser disbelieves in the intuition of super-sensible essences. Several points in Bauch's view of the judgment are also discussed. (i) Bauch supposes that the judgment is contained in the concept, hence that the two are logically identical. Geyser completely disagrees with this identification, and gives definitions of their respective functions. The judgment presupposes the concept, hence they cannot be identical. (ii) Bauch also believes that in a judgment, expressed as " A is B," the terms A and B are in a relation of mutual functional dependence. Geyser, in denying this assertion, says that it is not true that every alteration in the predicate is accompanied by an alteration in the subject; in the two judgments " God is just " and " God is omnipotent" the predicates are different, but the subject is the same. (iii) Bauch distinguishes the logical judgment from the subjective act of thinking. The system of logical judgments which is quite independent of human thinking (though not of all thinking) is identified with truth. A human judgment has validity if it corresponds with a logical judgment; and therefore, so Bauch supposes, the logical system must not only be, but also have validity. Geyser thinks Bauch is misusing the term " truth." His system of logical judgments is simply the system of facts to which the term " truth " does not apply. He cannot see that anything is explained by attributing validity to the system. Geyser points out that sense-perception and the particular constitute special difficulties for Neo-Kantianism. Bauch, unlike the Marburg school, recognizes the importance of sense-perception for knowledge of nature. He tries to show that the particular is necessarily connected with the logicaL system of truth. There is, he thinks, mutual implication between categories and particulars ; thus no particular is contingent. Geyser's main criticism is that the particular is contingent. Every particular implies some universal; but a concept is quite incapable of supplying its absolutely specific deter- 91</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES minations?these must be known through sense-experience. While, for example, " this line " implies the concept " line," the implication is not reciprocal; the concept " line" does not imply " this line." Geyser, however, does not appear to distinguish between a particular and an abso? lutely specific property. Geyser concludes his book by discussing the nature of evidence. A judgment in order to be known must, he says, not only be true, but known to be true, i.e., certain (gewiss). Evidence consists in seeing a relation between the judgment and some other content of experience (which may or may not be a judgment) where the relationship constitutes certainty. For example, the judgment "this white patch is different from that black one " is evident through the immediate seeing of a relation between a specific sense-experience, which is not a judgment, and the judgment itself. Reference must also be made to an original and interesting periodical whose name may be freely translated International Philosophical News.1 It is edited by Paul Feldkeller, and its purpose is to give information of philosophical activity all over the world; thus the fifth number contains articles on " Logic in India " and " Philosophy in Japan." The journal always contains notices of philosophical meetings and other items of news. It is profusely illustrated?the fourth number contains some rather charming pictures of scenes connected with Kant. Among the " news" may be found an account of the last joint session of the Aristotelian Society and Mind Association and an article on the Congress for iEsthetics held in Germany last June. The general theme of this Congress was " Symbol and Rhythm." Max Dessoir (Berlin) asks whether there is an independent history of art. He answers that there is, since each form of art shows an internal development: periods and styles follow each other according to principles implicit in the material. The lectures of Ziehen (Halle) and Cassirer (Hamburg) caused considerable excitement. Ziehen discussed rhythm as a mathematical property abstracted from sense. Cassirer, dis? cussing symbols, speaks of the aesthetic object as a functional, not a permanent, form. Emil Utitz (Halle) expresses his belief that a new style will arise from a new conception of humanity which is now being developed. The same number gives an account of an interesting speech delivered by Joel (Basle) at a meeting of the Kant Society. . He eulogizes the present century at the expense of the last. The fundamental tendency of the latter, he thinks, was to reduce the richness of life to some one formula; hence all the different monisms which arose. The life of a genius was a tragedy until finally genius disappeared. The renaissance of the opening century started with the dethronement of mathematics and the reinstatement of the individual.
