Pp. viii + 341. Cloth, $85.00. ISBN 0-521-83482-1. Davies's work is a great deal more focused, more original and more revealing than the omnium-gatherum title suggests. His subject is prodigies-intelligible messages sent by a fundamentally reason- able if exacting divine collective-and in his hands, prodigies be- come a surprisingly effective tool for the study of religion in the historians. He lays the groundwork (evidence of its origin in his dissertation) with a detailed analysis not just of the prodigies in Livy but of distinctions in Livy's language when reporting them, thus demonstrating that Livy takes these phenomena seriously, and (more significantly) that his use of the impersonal "it is said," far from indicating a sceptic's distance, forms part of a historian's sys- tem for ranking testimonial reliability. Davies also parses Livy's use of three critical words: fors, fatum and fortuna. He determines thatfors was a detail in the chain of events (115-16); fatum was the inevitable (120); and fortuna was "a lived experience of the vicissitudes of the best laid plans" (120). Most scholars regard these very Roman terms as all but interchangeable; Davies's findings will necessitate a much needed reevaluation of their function in Roman historiography. This highly particularized discussion of Livy's narration of pro- digies opens the way to Davies's conclusion that correct interpreta- tion of prodigies-that is, the cura deorum, the learned application of centuries of religious knowledge to specific events occasioned by the gods-was at the heart of the practice of state religion in Rome. This becomes the spring-board for his discussion of Tacitus, which is where his work becomes truly ground-breaking. Davies shows that Tacitus uses prodigies sparingly but purposefully, to delineate the state of Rome's relationship with the gods and to mark the ways in which the emperors prevented the religious system from functioning properly by, among other things, demanding-and then acting on- falsely favorable interpretations. In the Annales, Davies argues, Taci- tus charts the gradual breakdown of the pax deorum, as Rome became incapable of addressing the ira deum in ritual terms. Without learned interpretation to sustain the dialogue between the human and divine worlds, prodigies became a mockery, and Rome suffered the consequences. Historically, this culminated in the burning of the Capitoline temple, the "decapitation" of Rome itself, in 69-part of the Histories, which had been written earlier. Davies is superb on</page><page sequence="2">330 BOOK REVIEW Tacitus' account of the refounding of the Capitoline temple (H. 4.53) as a virtual definition of proper religious conduct and a potent and subtle attack on the principate, delivered by a historian who was also a quindecimvir, one of the primary interpretive authorities in the state. After this confident explication of Livy and Tacitus, Davies takes on Ammianus Marcellinus, though the results are notably less suc- cessful-prodigies happened; interpretation was the key; divination has replaced expiation as the central religious act. There is consider- able difficulty in categorizing any of this as "Roman religion," espe- cially as Davies chooses to label Julian's religion with the polemical title "paganism," implicitly accepting Christians and "pagans" as rival interpreters. Yet both believed in prodigies, and if bonum even- tum was the test, the Christians outclassed the "pagans" altogether. Thus, in his desire to pursue the interpretation of prodigies even into late antiquity, Davies runs into the problem of how to identify prodi- gies, their interpretation, or their historiography, as "Roman" rather than "Greek" or "Egyptian"-or indeed, as anything more specific than common Mediterranean practice. This at once muddies his two central arguments: that the Romans had a sophisticated and nuanced system of religious interpretation, and that Roman historians incor- porated both prodigies and their interpretations as significant and truth-revealing ways of understanding human events. Davies throughout maintains that each of the historians accepted the factuality of prodigies as well as the need for the cura deorum. It was the interpretation and the interpreters that succeeded or failed, and the historian who tracked the consequences. Davies makes an excellent case for both Livy and Tacitus (though a somewhat less convincing one for Ammianus). In so doing, he has begun to explain how Roman religion could continue to illuminate the meaning of history in a post-Hellenistic world, where Homeric anthropomorph- ism had been thoroughly deconstructed, and philosophy and art were playing allegorical games to preserve an ever more tenuous connection with archaic religious forms. We know that Roman reli- gion was a force to be reckoned with for an outsider like the Paduan Livy, and Davies has demonstrated that the Gallic-Italian rationalist Tacitus not only criticized the failure to listen to Rome's religious interpreters, but even, as quindecimvir, joined the learned few trying to attend to the cura deorum. Now we can begin to understand why. Davies does not make enough of his observation that Rome was a city of religious interpreters, that the Roman dialogue with the gods was held in the open air, as part of the business of the forum. Interpretation was a matter of public presentation, of public inter- action in Rome. The people in Rome were not passive listeners but an active and necessary audience, judging both the quality of the inter-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 331 preters and the accuracy of the interpretation; and their participation sustained a wide-spread belief in the significance of Rome's relation- ship with the gods, even when, in other aspects of the religious sys- tem, practice was suspect and belief was lacking. By demonstrating the importance of prodigies at Rome, the rigor of the priestly and senatorial consultation by which a prodigy was identified and inter- preted, and the historical (as well as historiographical) significance of authoritative public pronouncement on the event, Davies makes the strongest case yet that the application of speech act theory and performance theory to the practice of religion in Rome will be the next, innovative, step in the field. Davies has amassed a huge and diverse amount of evidence, which he is liable to train in unexpected directions as support for an extended, and often brilliant, exposition. One such is his analysis of Livy's treatment of Scipio, essential reading for anyone interested in that general or the shifting relationship between Roman leaders and their gods. His argument that Tacitus may have thought that a ter- rible saeculum, begun at Actium in 31 BCE, was brought to a hideous conclusion a hundred years later in the year of the four emperors, is another. Livy, Tacitus, and Ammianus embraced religion as interpreta- tion and used prodigies and the interpretation of prodigies to define the ebbing and surging tide of Roman history. Davies has revealed just how important these negotiations with the gods were in struc- turing the historians' ideas of Rome and in shaping the judgments conveyed by their narratives. That being so, scholars of religion and of Roman historiography will need to consider Davies' arguments very carefully indeed. University of Iowa CARIN GREEN</page></plain_text>
