<plain_text><page sequence="1">Browning's Godot PATRICIA M. BALL A S THE MISTS clear and it becomes apparent that Victorian â– ^ poetry has been the victim of inept criticism and obtuse reading, it becomes even clearer that Browning in particular has suffered to a crippling degree. It is scarcely too much to say that he has not been critically considered as a poet at all; in an age which prides itself on its literary sophistication, comment on his poetry has made the most naive assumptions about the "intentions" which may be discerned in it and the deductions which may be drawn from it. Even admiration for his obvious skill in handling his monologues has coexisted with a complacent denial that these monologues reveal subtlety of substance and poetic attitude. What may be termed the "Rabbi Ben Ezra" approach, which regards Browning as a brash optimist using poems as banners to cheer the fainthearted, has per- sisted with incredible longevity in the same minds that will readily praise Donne for being able to create certain moods and tones in his poems, and will censure as puerile any reading of him that assumes him personally to be cynic or libertine or whatever else he under- stands sufficiently to portray poetically. The first step towards a maturing criticism can be taken if the Rabbi is never allowed out on his own; that is, he should not stray from the company of, at the least, the Bishop ordering his tomb and the other Bishop setting out his apology. Nor should Caliban ever be overlooked. This assembly immediately strikes a blow at the oversimplification of Browning: where is "his attitude" in this group? It calls attention at once to an essential factor, the variety of his creation, and it hints, moreover, that this variety is not just that of a fortuitous crowd. The presence of Caliban, moreover, is a reminder of a crucial element in Browning's imagination: his ironic sense of the grotesque in the person of the natural man. Here in brief are the materials for a criticism which will inject new meaning into the tired old examination phrase "master of the dramatic mono- logue," blast away the childish theologizing pronouncements about him, and open routes that reveal a most complex imagination, belong- ing profoundly to its own day but postulating the world of Samuel Beckett's Estragon and Vladimir. The poems just mentioned therefore are intended as a microcosm. They all involve human relations with a supernatural world, and if they do so explicitly and centrally, there is hardly a poem of Browning's 245</page><page sequence="2">246 Victorian Poetry not in some way concerned with this hypothesis of a context for humanity. But the key word is hypothesis, a point unperceived by the false criticism. Even if the cries of Ben Ezra are not regarded as Browning's first and last views on the universe, it is generally assumed that all the speakers of the monologues are in effect mouthpieces, and that the poet has created them as prejudged beings whose be- havior and theories are automatically referred to a central totem of belief. They are either conformists or deviators, and are seen in this light by their creator, with no uncertainties. From this, it is further assumed that when they speak of the best that is to be and the perfect round to come, they bask in the admiring and proselytizing acquiescence of the poet, and when they express worldliness, speculative doubts, or more eccentric views on the way of things, their puppet-master is sorrowfully shaking his head as he pulls their strings. Yet there is no literary reason for these suppositions - only literary prejudice. It is a pleasing detail of this critical situation to see the Pelican Guides essay on Browning condemning the ambiguities of Bishop Blougrams Apology, with the explanation that Browning him- self was confused by the argument, and this - in a poet written off long ago as rigidly certain of himself and what he wants to assert - "this will never do." What has to be recognized is the fine balance of Browning's relationship with his creations. It is no help to swing away from the puppet-master view only to deny him any further incentive in the making of monologues than that provided by the patronizing 'Tie loved human nature" observation. This approach rests content with the title Men and Women at its face value, cherishes the portrait- gallery analogy, and never goes on to wonder whether a poet might assemble a gallery for more urgent reasons than the simple desire to suggest that people are various and often odd. Browning's imaginative nature is to be found between these extremes, and by drawing something from both: his creative at- tention is engaged by the coincidence in each person of certain common human factors with a unique individual expression of them. From this arises the necessity of seeing his poems as a whole, but of appreciating with equal force, the range they offer. Without this dual awareness, his work is distorted and reduced. There is point in asking the question, why does he create such numerous and various beings, for there is an answer to it; but the answer is not, because he is a poet who has his world-picture cut and dried and wishes to promote this by a series of advertisements displaying success stories and the reverse.</page><page sequence="3">Pattucia M. Ball 247 The answer, in brief, is Godot, not God. The common factor that Browning sees is the blinkered human mind which suspects that there is a landscape on either side of the road, but never achieves more than a glimpse, or perhaps hears some sound - music or thunder - that aggravates the suspicion. Fantasies, he observes, may well be erected on slight intimation: the unseen landscape may oust the known realities of the road, and prove an obsession; and there are many other possibilities. The practical horse may con- centrate the more intensively on oats in the nosebag, the beauties of the roan mare, the joys of being a thoroughbred, while the sagacious may regard the landscape as a stimulating hypothesis without losing his alertness to the immediate problems and pleasures of the road. Browning's imagination, that is, creates out of its percep- tion of such a universal situation, not out of any personal conceit that it has no blinkers itself. He realizes intensely that questions are only answered out of the brilliant virtuosity of each individual and his equipment, the shapelessness of any given human span being conjured into significance - with heights, depths, and crises - by the indestructible energies of the personal urge to identity. As Estragon and Vladimir wrest their sense of themselves out of the fulfilment of each minute with its dramas of broken boots, questions reaching formulation, spasms of emotion, sudden encounters, and play this off against the vast unformulated and unknown, so Browning's bishops, aristocrats, lovers, artists, and monks enact their scenes of self -creation and combat the silence stretching on either side. The monologues regarded in this way attain their rightful dignity - a dignity that embraces grotesquerie. Instead of appearing to be feats of a very skilled yet superficial creativity, the work of a poet with a knack rather than an insight, they are shown to be poetry which catches the travail of human self-realization, the sharp focusing of self -experience. In this lies the vital interpenetration of form and substance so often denied to Browning: the monologue is the moment of travail, an act of birth; the speaker delivers his own being through his speaking. This is not just a way of saying that Browning's speakers move towards self-knowledge in the more usual moral sense, or that his skill is to make them reveal more to the reader than they know themselves. Both these things happen in the monologues - Andrea del Sarto sees his nature more ruthlessly by the end of his musing, while the future resident of St. Praxed's remains more comfortably uncritical of his past than some of his readers will be - but bishop and painter alike are brought out of the mists and become themselves as they speak. Whether the character concerned is in-</page><page sequence="4">248 Victorian Poetry trospective and self-critical or not, each asserts "what I am is me - for this I came," and so counters the brooding, or empty, silence of Godot, of which each - however peripherally - is aware. This is the only philosophy or theology Browning can honestly be accused of. "Existential" or "empirical" are terms more relevant than those usually applied to him, from "nonconformist" to "optimist." All the so-called religious sections of the poems stand within this context. Wherever God enters the poems, he comes as a property of the speaker's self-made universe: he is not the poet's ultimate, for Browning's faith rests upon the one certainty - human uncertainty, the ignorance or doubt of any such ultimate. In one sense he does share the ambiguities of Bishop Blougram, and because he can depict that deliberated route-plotting through an enigmatic universe, the more heartily committed voices should be recognized as emerging from little shelters built to keep out the vast and unresponding night. But it is through the voice of Caliban that Browning makes his own imaginative foundations most clear, and helps to reveal the orientation of the monologues. This poem has rightly been regarded as satiric comment on current religious attitudes, and Berdoe's careful demarcation of its frontiers - "to rebuke the anthropomorphic idea of God as it exists in minds of a narrow and unloving type" - is only a caricature version of the kind of attention it has universally attracted. It serves to show something of the inadequacy of this approach, with its twofold suggestion that Browning is primarily offering a negative criticism and is doing so from the assured standpoint of his orthodox, wide and loving, Christian faith. This is unwarranted assumption, for if the poem is taken with no preconceived notions about his probable motives for writing it; if, that is, it is read without the handi- cap of "Rabbi Ben Ezra" having been arbitrarily chosen as the pole star of Browning's imaginative heavens, then it stands forth with its own claims to be the more positive luminary and the better guide to those heavens. The poem shows Browning moved by the spectacle of the natural man, the human creature with his bare resources making what he can of his situation. Irony remains an essential ingredient in this interpretation too, but the motive is exploratory and the impulse empirical rather than critical. Caliban would settle well beneath the Becket tree. His life is passed waiting for Setebos, and his strategy for coping with this burden of an enigmatic unknown power has close affinities with the methods of the tramps. He endows it with a character, if not a long white beard; he accommodates his pastimes to its deduced reactions, so that his entire life is a comment on its supposed nature; he receives messages, not from a boy, but from rain,</page><page sequence="5">Patricia M. Ball 249 thunder, and earthquake, and these messages leave him exactly where he was before he had them. Like the tramps, that is, he is left with the necessity of invention and interpretation. Estragon is no more mystified, apprehensive, oppressed, or creatively stimulated to realize his own existence than Caliban, Browning's study in basic man. From this angle, other apparent problems in the poem disappear. The sense of incongruity, for instance, implied in L. G. Salinger's description of the poem as "Shakespeare's savage. . .speaking as an exponent of natural religion in the light of Darwinism" is no longer an awkwardness. Caliban is simultaneously primitive and don: this is Browning's point about the human condition; and all his people, from Abt Vogler to Mr. Sludge, illustrate it. Each constructs his Setebos, or his Quiet, each lives in accordance with his conception, each awaits confirmation of his own god, his own universe; and no one in the monologues achieves more - or less - in this respect than Caliban on his island: Saith He is terrible: watch His feats in proof! One hurricane will spoil six good months' hope. He hath a spite against me, that I know, Just as He favours Prosper, who knows why? It does not throw the poems out of the Godot context here being claimed as their rightful home, if it is argued that Browning shows himself very conscious of the idea of revelation. This is indeed an important factor, affecting the poems structurally as well as thematically. But it is not a sign that while some of the poems await Godot, abiding in questions, others are written from an orthodox viewpoint, campaigning for the Christian God. Revelation is in fact recognized as a concept of high ambiguity and Browning's imagination is released by this awareness, not by an act of religious assent to it as a single solution or countering force to the blind man's buff of natural theology. To put this another way, Browning is attracted by the concept of revelation as a feature of the psychological mechanism, with the immense range of individual variety which this involves, not as the theologian's implement of revealed truth. In this capacity, it plays an important part in many poems, and is integral to the Godot poetic universe. This is most readily apparent in such monologues as the "Epistle from Karshish" and "Abt Vogler." Comment on these poems has implied that the former is Browning as propagandist contributing to the debate on religious faith, and the latter a vehicle for conveying his outlook on "broken arcs" and "perfect round." Kharshish has been confronted with living evidence for Christianity, and Vogler does</page><page sequence="6">250 Victorian Poetry soliloquize on the relationship of earth and heaven; but the imagina- tive center in each poem is the experience of revelation, that is, a psychological happening, a shift of being from the usual web of habitual assumptions and expectations to a new position and a con- sequently changed universe. Both Kharshish and Vogler undergo this translation. Each reacts in his own way, but as a further result, each is more acutely aware of his usual world, his everyday self. Although from a Christian point of view the poems may bear another kind of significance, this is extraneous to their life as poems, for they are made vital by the poet's concern with a man undergoing his own special kind of revelation, the experience which exposes him to himself by the shock of its unfamiliarity and its demand that he assimilate it into his universe, whether he accepts it or not. Kharshish henceforth must live with his memory of Lazarus, and he is no longer unconscious- ly enclosed in his role of Arab physician: he knows what he is, where his boundaries are, what lies beyond them; and Vogler, after his zenith of creative excitement, knows himself returned to the mundane, the "C Major of this life" - he has placed normality and its boundaries. Both monologues seek to record the rhythm of such experiences, to register it seismographically. In this they are not isolated. It is a cliche of Browning criticism to speak of his "revelations of character/' but the term should retain its place only if it is realized that it has far more potency than this tired phrase suggests; that it has within it the sense of die speaker's own discovery of himself, with all the religious force of meaning - the dawning of new light and vision - retained, yet without the narrower theological associations. Thus Lippo Lippi, Mr. Sludge, Andrea del Sarto, the Wife to the Husband all undergo the experience of revelation and their poems record the process, the movement of emotion and perception, as it takes place. This is the ambition of the monologues and it is what happens in Waiting for Godot; the play proposes and the monologues more obliquely suggest that this may well be all that can happen. We realize we are in the world, we discover we are Estragon or Andrea del Sarto, and that our history is a saga of broken boots or lifeless pictures; we learn also that we may add to, alter, revise or choose not to revise our ideas of ourselves, our universe, Setebos and Godot, if we meet Lazarus or encounter Pozzo and Lucky. But beyond this, a small clearing in a fog, we cannot experience anything. We make ourselves from within, our Godot attendant on this painfully constructed image. Becket's play in its demonstration of human solitude does, how- ever, at the same time show its relativity. Estragon has Vladimir, and displaying the agony and necessity of this bond is a salient factor</page><page sequence="7">Patricia M. Ball 251 in the operation of Waiting for Godot. To Browning also, the tension of relationships is crucial. The monologue's power is partly dependent on its being a potential dialogue and it is the presence of the listener that brings it to birth, forcing the crisis of utterance, and hence of revelation, the clarity of discovery. Blougram and Gigadibs are the most obvious example of this, as the bishop creates a version of him- self expressly for his visitor, but Browning's awareness of relationships is prismatic. He ranges from the fortuitous encounter - Lippo Lippi and the watch - through the "ghostly" but persistent company of Waring, the lifelong and deathlong rivalries of St. Praxed's bishop and Gandolf, to the formidable intimacies of lover and mistress, husband and wife. In these last is the pattern of Vladimir and Estragon most strikingly approached, in the complexities of revolt and dependence, antagonism and attraction, which are explored - â–  with ruthless analysis in "]ames Lee's Wife," the lyrical despair of "In a Year," the ironic bite of "Porphyria's Lover," to select only a few from the array of studies and their equal variety of mood. What Becket dis- plays through the minute to minute shifts of feeling between the tramps, Browning presents in the whole range of the monologues. Human interaction within the context of an unknown concerns them both. Each poet perceives the rhythm of lives most intensely as a continual postponement of results, answers, or conclusions, so that the stuff of experience is the sustained query dominating the immediate procession of exchanges with and adjustment to others. Integral to this is the sensation of arrival at the brink of revelation. Godot is always imminent; he may, he almost certainly will arrive today. And so with Browning's men and women: together with their experience of self- revelation already discussed, there is this further expectation of the ultimate enlightenment. This is an aspect which has structural influence on the monologues. The final verse of "In a Year" affords a simple example: Dear, the pang is brief. Do thy part, Have thy pleasure. How perplext Grows belief! Well, this cold clay clod Was man's heart Crumble it- and what comes next? Is it God? The immediate foreground of the speaker's experience has here suffered disaster: the context of query takes its place, is confronted and moves the poem on to climax by the bald challenge reaching into the silence. The ultimate is invited to answer for itself. But</page><page sequence="8">252 Victorian Poetry this is essentially the end of the poem; and the word "God" is not offered doctrinally as an answer in itself but as a term suggesting the enigma and the breadth of the question - to be read as Godot. Browning's sense of the climactic question - either in words or action - rules the construction of many of the monologues, and is a feature of his imagination far more pertinent to his whole poetic universe than the answers he is supposed to have offered in the voice of Ben Ezra and others. "Artemis Prologuizes" climbs to the pregnant pause of the goddess surveying the restored Hippolytus, expecting resurrection: And ye, white crowd of woodland sister-nymphs, Ply, as the Sage directs, these buds and leaves That strew the turf around the Twain! While I Await, in fitting silence, the event. This - with less confidence - is the attitude of mind of the human speakers; they live in the hope and the shadow of a possible "event." At times, they may feel it has taken place, as in the poems of requited love, but more often, such assumptions are shown to be illusions and the question only presses the more urgently in the deepened silence: "Is it God?" The step from here to Vladimir and the Boy is a short one: Vladimir: You have a message from Mr. Godot. Boy: Yes, sir. Vladimir: He won't come this evening. Boy: No, sir. Vladimir: But he'll come tomorrow. Boy: Yes, sir. Vladimir: Without fail. Boy: Yes, sir. Silence The intimate connection between "Childe Roland" and the other monologues is nowhere better shown than in this structural rhythm of movement to a climax which is always the human challenge, the fear, and the imminence of revelation, and never the avatar him- self. The horn sounding, out of the horror of Roland's self-knowledge, into the dark and desolate landscape with its "round squat turret, blind as the fool's heart," is Browning's fundamental vision transmuted into symbolic form, not at all a stray bastard with a different face and no place in the legitimate assembly of monologues. "Porphyria's Lover" provides a last example of the importance of the Godot awareness to Browning as a poet. Here again, it supplies him with a climax which at once reaches out to the reader, provoking reaction, and reverberates back through the whole poem, so that its nature is only grasped fully after this detonation:</page><page sequence="9">Patricia M. Ball 253 And thus we sit together now, And all night long we have not stirred, And yet God has not said a word! As this is one of the two poems headed originally "in a madhouse cell," the first level of implication here is ironic: God, in the sense of a voice of judgment on the act, has indeed spoken. The murder has been assessed, the murderer labelled and dismissed. The lover's unconscious- ness of this contains a further irony, deflating the high expectations of waiting on the event, the human conceit of assuming its deeds im- portant enough to attract a deity's attention in terms of wrath and thunderbolt. At the same time, as in "Caliban upon Setebos," the parallel assumption, that the deity may be conniving, and condoning this action, is likewise implied and mocked: he is either with me or against me - such is the human basis in making a god. The force of Browning's feeling for context goes into this poem as into more developed ones - Porphyria's murderer sits forever under the tree with Estragon and Vladimir, inventing his god, exhibiting simultaneously his immunity and his hopeless vulnerability to the facts of the situation, the situation being life itself. For Browning with Becket takes his poetic stand on the perception that for all of us, time is passed thus: creating a Setebos or Godot in our own image, living to a rhythm of endless expectation, clinging to each other and to illusion, yet capable of blowing the only possible horn of revelation, that which discovers us to ourselves, waiting beneath the tree in the silence of Godot's world.
