Introduction In the vernacular treatise Des monstres et des prodiges, which repre- sents the peak of sixteenth-century teratological knowledge, the French surgeon Ambroise Pare enumerated as many as thirteen possible causes for the birth of monsters. These ranged from the greater glory of God to His wrath, and passed through the Devil's malevolence, the mother's imagination, the corruption of the sperm and mechanical causes (such as the pressure of the uterus, accidents and illness).' From the original conviction that monsters were deliberately sent by God as a warning for our sins, there emerged over time a more specific interest in a category that was conceptually very large.2 Carried on the waves of the marvelous, it I A.

Older positivist works, such as the classic studies by Geoffroy Saint- Hilaire and Martin, remain useful inventories of nineteenth-cen- tury curiosity and learning. But nothing sounds now more out-of- date than the ingenuously linear historical path that these authors sought to retrace. They believed to perceive a steady progress from godly fear through the obsessive dread of disorder to the full "naturalization" of the wonderful and rare. Today, we are of course aware of the fact that the history of teratology was everything but a straightforward progress in anatomy, physiology, embryology and genetics. To the contrary, it belongs to the evolution of naturalis- tic sensibilities for the complex interplay of various emotions, ranging from marvel to fear, from pleasure to curiosity. The dia- lectics of knowledge and attitudes is not linear, but follows a wave- like, or possibly cyclical, course. Over the last thirty years, a num- ber of fundamental contributions to the subject has managed to throw some light on this issue. Among them are, for example, Canguilhem's essay La monstruosite et le monstrueux and the pages dedicated to monsters in Roger's classic Histoire des sciences de la vie. A similar viewpoint was presented also in C6ard's vast panorama of the "insolite" in sixteenth-century France; in Tort's suggestions regarding eighteenth-century developments; and in Park and Daston's article on "Unnatural Conceptions" of 1981, in which the authors analyzed the first stages of the early modern interest in monsters.4 See J.-L.

Daston, "Unnnatural Conceptions: the Study</page><page sequence="3">EPIGENESIS OF THE MONSTROUS FORM 5 Park and Daston's most recent contribution to this topic is very different." The two authors have enlarged their earlier project both chronologically and thematically, chronologically by taking the story up to the Enlightenment, and thematically by opening their analysis from the specific case of the monstrous to the gen- eral history of wonder and of the wonderful. On the topic of the history of teratology, their book breaks rather sharply with previ- ous interpretations, for it denies its progressive character. Accord- ing to their interpretation, the process goes from Aristotle's admi- ration for the inexhaustible variety and flexibility of the natural order to St. Augustine's religious sensibilities, and from there to the medieval naturalization of the wondrous, to the amazement of Renaissance philosophers, and finally to the reversal of the tradi- tional relation between curiosity and wonder during the Enlight- enment. But Daston and Park stress that all of these developments did not take place because of positive developments in scientific knowledge. Instead, it was the result of a complex interaction be- tween metaphysical, aesthetic and political factors-in other words, because of ideological reasons and not for the triumph of Reason and Science. The originality of this interpretation, the vast- ness of the erudition unfolded in its support, and, above all, its rejection of interpretations generally accepted in the recent histo- riography all make it impossible to ignore this study in any future contribution to the debate, however modest or ambitious it be. In the present essay, I shall analyze some specific events in an eighteenth-century phase of the querelle, together with the views of some leading participants, and thereby highlight two main points: 1) In the period when the theory of preformation was the domi- nant view, the dispute over the origin of monsters took place not between adherents of preformation and adherents of epigenesis, of Monsters in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century France and England," Past and Present 92 (1981), 20-54.

The dispute over monsters pitted prefor- mation against the mechanical genesis, not of the germ-for these were the very years of the complete triumph of preformationism over epigenesis-, but of the monstrous form, shifting the classi- cal opposition between preformation and epigenesis inside the camp of preformation. Two cases in point are the examples of LUmery and Winslow, discussed below. 2) One of the most important episodes in the shift of teratology from a primarily theological or metaphysical issue to a purely natu- ral one was due to Albrecht von Haller. Haller, a champion of the doctrine of original monstrosity (that is, of the theologically most 'convenient' theory), shifted the discussion from anatomy and theology to embryology. And his embryology (which was 'false' but purely scientific and hence not theological) provided alone the foundation for his teratological thesis. The metaphysical preoccu- pations, which had been prevailing in all other authors, were rel- egated to the background thanks to the new positive scientific data. Unlike Park and Daston, I shall not try to provide an objective study of the sensibilities and psychology of the scientific intellec- tuals who took part in the dispute. At yet, it is my conviction that the following analysis reveals the paradoxical and unexpected roles played, in turn, by ideological prejudices, research methods, and scientific data. It would be rather difficult, at least on the basis of the very partial episodes we shall consider here, to reject en- tirely the idea that the development of teratology-which contin- ues to be one of the most fascinating topics of the history of medi- cine-showed progressive tendencies. It would indeed be very hard to deny that embryology made some progress thanks to Haller. At the same time, it would be even harder to deny that Haller's data, which were surprisingly advanced for his time, came accompanied by a bigoted religion, or that Haller was a tormented spirit, who loathed philosophes and exercized himself in the stalest of apologetics. By way of introduction, it will first be necessary to provide a brief and highly selective account of those sixteenth and seventeenth- century aspects of the querelle that provided the basis for the spe- cific eighteenth-century debate with which this article is con- cerned.</page><page sequence="5">EPIGENESIS OF THE MONSTROUS FORM 7 2. Natural order and divine freedom in the sixteenth- and seventeenth- century dispute over monsters Pard's work was pervaded by a strong sense of joy over the variety of creation, whose "complexite delicate" and "somptueuse diver- site" the author was trying to unveil to his reader.' But at the same time, it contained the idea that each category of monsters required a specific causal account. In his successful De monstrorum caussis (1616), the Paduan physician Fortunio Liceti returned instead to the habit of citing a variety of causes for a single deviant anatomi- cal group.' He displayed no understanding of Par 's predomi- nantly clinical attitude, but questioned its worth at a metaphysico- theological level, charing it with blasphemy for having attributed such an abomination as monsters to the creator.8 Liceti was care- ful to place God at a distance from deviancy despite of the fact that he tried to insert his own teratogeny into the context of a prefor- mistic embryology. The resulting view was that monstrosity was preformed in the seed, but that those responsible were the parents who were the carriers of the malformation. All in all, the curiosity aroused by monsters did not by itself induce scholars to undertake investigations into their etiological and clinical aspects; but it certainly did help to mitigate the tradi- tionally negative view which saw in monsters signs of disaster. In other words, monsters gradually received attention in their own right, whereas in the past, they had been significant only insofar as they denoted something else, namely what had happened be- fore (the sin) or what would have happened afterwards (the pun- ishment). This development allowed monsters to escape their function of being a sign of disorder in creation and to enter into the natural world without necessarily rendering it less perfect or worthy. If anything, they could now even be seen to enrich and to diversify creation. For those who wished to believe that creation was everywhere benevolently purposeful, there existed even the possibility of contemplating the commercial use of abnormalities. As Liceti and the Aristotelian physician Jean Riolan the Younger pointed out, the birth of such a being could make the fortune of the families that had produced it.9 Nevertheless, the cause of the 6 C'ard, La nature et les prodiges, 317. 7 See Fischer, De la genesefabuleuse, 24. 8 See Wilson, Signs and Portents, 68. 9J. Riolan, De mostro nato Lutetiae anno Domini MDCV disputatio philosophica (1st</page><page sequence="6">8 MARIA TERESA MONTI anomaly was steadily further distanced from the divine hand. Most frequently, authors blamed "the imaginative power of women", an explanation that had the great advantage of avoiding any involve- ment of providence.10 Malebranche, for example, shared and re- peated the story of a child whose body was broken at the same points as that of a condemned man the child's mother had seen on the wheel. The mother's imagination could still be said to defy the laws of nature and be associated with error and disorder, but Malebranche offered a mechanical explanation of the genesis of the monstrosity itself, attributing it to the action of animal spirits which had been troubled by the overly violent shock and which had as a result affected the embryo's extremely malleable flesh." To resort to the mother's responsibility remained popular at least until--pace Malebranche'2-more precise studies showed the un- tenable nature of this belief within a more rigorously defined theory of pre-existence. The facts were now better known, but the explanation did not become simpler as a result. Around the mid-seventeenth century, the arrival and total tri- umph of the emboitement theory in its variant model of ovist pre- existence rendered the origin of monsters a question of absolute importance.' Importantly, advocates of pre-existence soon learned ed., 1605), in Opuscula anatomica nova (London, 1649), 509: "Quid sinistri prae- nuntient nostrae gemelleae, nec scio, nec inquiro, nec ab iis metuo, aut metu- endum puto. Hoc unum affirmo, earum nativitatem felicem fuisse, et fortunatam toti familiae, parentes enim ex illis fecerunt, et faciunt quotidie uberrimum questum, earum beneficio ab angustia rei familiaris, qua premebantur liberati sunt. Concursus enim frequentissimus undique factus est ad illas invisendas, illi neminem admittebant, qui justum non pervolvisset. Naturales partus illi erant oneri, paupertatis onus gemellae istae suo exortu a familia excusserunt." Com- pare F. Liceti, De monstrorum caussis (Padua, 1616), book I, ch. 2.

Malebranche's belief in the power of the mother's imagination is "all the more remarkable in that he sided with the ovists and the partisans of preformation" (Huet, Monstrous Imagination, p. 45; cf. p. 50). 1' For the history of generation theories see Roger, Les sciences de la vie; F.

For the representatives of the doctrine of "original monstrosity," the monstrous organism derived in fact from a pre- existing germ which was itself monstrous. Its first cause was there- fore the divinity which had directly created it, implanting it in the first representative of the species, just as in the case of all other generations. But it was also possible that God merely permitted the existence of the monster and was therefore only the second cause, the first cause being various accidents which operated on the pre- formed germ so as to produce a perfect order. The partisans of an accidental origin of the monster excluded, by contrast, God from such mere products of mechanical or pathological contingencies. These contingencies had acted on the germ and had transformed it into a disorderly deviant which in fact did not reproduce itself, did not survive, and displayed in its early death the only sign of providence. This conflict opposed preformation and mechanical genesis no longer of the germ, but of the monstrous form.14 The very debate that had at a higher level opposed preformation to epigenesis was here carried entirely into the domain of preformationism. The different views, which had for about fifty years each been defended stubbornly by the leading figures in the field faded away into the vindicated truth of a manifest "biological theocentrism."'5 Accord- ing to the dominant iatromechanical conception of living matter, the idea of an active and creative nature which could be inserted between monsters and God, had by now become unthinkable. Once this "screen"'' had evaporated, God became immediately implicated, regardless of whether one considered him the direct cause of the monster, powerfully expressing his divine freedom or instead the indirect cause reflected in the benevolent variety of nature. But in fact, God was implicated even though one 'had to' separate him from the monster, 'because' it was disorder and con- tradiction. Nothing was produced in the anomaly which had not already first been there in the preformed germ, because deviance excluded neoformation, also in the case of an accidental origin.

It was inevitable that the dispute would soon take on clear theo- logical overtones. In order to exculpate God from the accusation of being unjust, the official, accidentalist doctrine of the Parisian Academie des Sciences ended up limiting God's potency and restrict- ing his freedom in an obviously anthropomorphic manner, as Pierre-Sylvain Regis rightly pointed out." Echoing the Jansenist criticism of those who desired to regulate divine grace according to human requirements," Regis did not completely reject acci- dents, but reduced them also to God's will which reigned alone and absolute according to designs that were incomprehensible to man.'9 And all things considered, monsters appeared monstrous to us only because of the limitations of our mechanistic reasoning. Whereas Malebranche had attributed monsters to chance in order to avoid a scandal, Regis held the creator responsible, but without producing any scandal. The Secretary of the Acadimie, Fontenelle, shared Regis' opinion regarding the limitations of our intellect and, though being on the whole less interested in divine attributes, made use of them in order to return once more to Malebranche's natural causes.20 17 See P.-S.

Epigenesis of the monster and preformation of the germ: Lemery and Winslow in comparison One classical case of a situs inversus, which was presented to the Acadimie in 1689 by the surgeon Jean Mary, did at first not receive all the attention it deserved. The anatomical dissection of Jean Mace, a soldier who had died at the Invalides at the age of seventy- two, showed a complete inversion of the organs, with the heart and the spleen being on the right, the liver on the left etc. But now, what sort of accident could ever explain such a topographically perfect irregularity?" The real turning point in the querelle des monstres, the incident that was able to shake a basically conserva- tive body as was the Acadimie, only took place in 1706 thanks to the work of the anatomist Joseph-Guichard Duverney. Duverney is an excellent example of the new type of protagonist who was then appearing on the scene. His Observations sur deux enfans joints en- semble constitute indeed the first attempt to deny, on the basis of anatomical research, the accidental character of monsters and to defend the original nature of monstrosity in an acute and novel way. According to his doctrine, the original monstrosity was pre- cisely and explicitly situated first in the preformed germ, which was the optimal materialization of the power and intelligence of the creator. Duverney undertook a detailed description of a double monster, that is, exactly the type of case most loved by the accidentalists who found it easy to explain such a being as the result of two perfect germs mechanically welded together or as the product of an overabundance of seed.22 Yet Duverney demolished his adversaries. In his opinion, the dissection of the soldier Mace fully established and legitimated the conclusion that the original- ity of deviance was the only possible explanation also for the double monster, a machine assembled in an anomalous fashion and yet a proof of infinite teleological wisdom. Such was the ex- tent of this wisdom that the monstrosity of the creature could al- commun6ment les Monstres comme des jeux de la Nature, mais les Philosophes sont tres-persuad6s que la Nature ne se jouE point, qu'elle suit tofijours inviola- blement les mimes Regles, et que tous ses ouvrages sont, pour ainsi dire, egale- ment serieux.

Indeed, the monster inaugurated a new or- der instead of destroying the old one. Duverney insisted that he had limited himself to the sphere of strictly anatomical descriptions and that he willingly left the causes of monstrosity to be explained by the theologian. However, a tone of admiration and wonder underlay his entire account of the au- topsy. In other words, anatomy led to an "aesthetic-metaphysical determination"23 which prevented one from subscribing to any accidentalist etiology. It was obvious that the collision between two clocks could not result in a third, well-functioning clock and that no organisation, that is, vital cohesion, could arise out of blind, unintelligent dynamics.24 For although the twins had no anus, their colon was so short as to produce only liquid waste, which flowed into a single double bladder where it mixed with the urine into a liquid of ideal consistency to be expelled through the only orifice. It was the very absence of the anus that allowed the crea- ture some possibility of movement. Missing parts and asymmetries seemed thus all to be explicable in terms of compensations: what would have been a defect in a normal organism was perfectly suited to the needs of the monster. Its structure was not only co- herent with respect to the redistribution of the vital functions, but it would also have been surprisingly well-adjusted for survival, had it been reasonably well cared for. In keeping with this view, the illustrations accompanying Duverney's essay did not at all strive to fulfill the traditional task of conveying or strengthening the idea of temptation, sin, and punishment. Instead, they showed serene, almost smiling, faces (fig. 1).25 Every feature of the twins' anatomy was the sign of an omnipotent creator, who used all his tools with amazing flexibil- ity. By deviating from the usual construction plans, the monster celebrated the richness and freedom of divine providence rather than its regularity. And yet, the functionality of the monster ex- 23 Tort, L'ordre et les monstres, 24. 24 Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences (1724), 20: "I1 ne paroit pas facile que les debris et les ruines de deux Oeufs confondus, et par consequent presque detruits l'un par I'autre s'assemblent asses heureusement, et asses juste pour former cette nouvelle organisation absolument necessaire.

Starting in 1724, its support- ers counter-attacked with extreme boldness with a series of memoires presented in a markedly controversial tone by the French physician and chemist Louis L6mery.27 L6mery's was a wholesale offensive, for he attacked the opposing theory on several fronts si- multaneously, charging it with methodological weakness, meta- physico-theological awkwardness and insufficient anatomical evi- dence. According to L6mery, explaining monsters through pre- ordination was at best simplistic and at worst a convenient alibi for ignorance and scientific laziness.

Although his contributions were directed at all specialists, for al- most twenty years and despite the various developments of the querelle, he kept Duverney as his main opponent and ideal target and devoted himself to discrediting this author's work. Like the vast majority of his colleagues, both supporters or adversaries, Lkmery himself was an undoubting champion of ovist pre-existence. His diagnosis of the case of a double monster (fig. 2) was that it was produced by the chance mechanical compres- sion of two perfect germs. The embryo was soft, flexible and deli- cate, and hence more susceptible to knocks and squashing. Whyever should one evoke a purpose for "productions [...] si folles, si difectueuses?"28 Their unreasonable oddity-summarized as "bouleversement, desordre, derangement, confusion, execu- tions manquees"29-did not violate the invariable natural laws, nor the wise plan of creation, precisely because God was responsible only for the primordial and still perfect creation. His opponents' attribution of monsters to the infinite freedom of God bordered therefore on the ridiculous. With caustic irony, LUmery illustrated his case with the usual metaphor of the wise watchmaker. Every- one could imagine his reaction if he had been accused of produc- ing a malfunctioning mechanism with the 'praiseworthy' intent of thereby celebrating his freedom of choice.30 By contrast, the per- fection of a being lay indeed in its regularity and permanence.3' Not even the location of the seam between the two original or- ganisms gave LUmery too much food for thought. His monster had two spinal columns, which were in good conditions, possessed 28 LUmery, "Second m6moire," 323. " LUmery, "Sur les monstres.

But oddly enough, they appeared to be sepa- rated by a curious third spine (fig. 3). This "epine fausse" was immediately taken by his adversaries to constitute the Achilles' heel of the theory. Squashing could indeed account for double structures or for the absence of a part of an organ ordinarily di- vided in two, but it was obvious that the third spine did not derive from any pre-existing element, nor was there, for lack of evidence, any reason for supposing that a third germ had been involved in the process. To this charge, Lemery replied that it was sufficient to recognise the natural capacities of the living to refunctionalize the deviant, that is, "to produce a new arrangement, by the use of which the animal, monstrous as it may be, nonetheless nourishes itself, lives, and vegetates."32 Thus the phantom of neoformation was banned. The false spine, far from pointing to an original de- sign for a singular creature, was simply the result of a process ("la cicatrice"). It was a true "fiction experimentale""33 which sutured and consolidated the external surface of the monster and pre- served its organization."4 32 Limery, "Sur les monstres.

For the activation of this ability, no miracle was required, nor did it illustrate God's power. All that was involved were anatomico-functional mechanics, provided that the accident had not destroyed, but only deviated, the vital mecha- nism.36 The extreme plasticity of the structures under formation could even result in the fortuitous production of new supplemen- tary elements. At the edges of the ordinary routes, secondary vital connections could be formed by what L6mery synthetically called the "ressources de la Nature.""' These ensured the continuation of life beyond and outside the normal course of events. Perhaps the most interesting and last development in Lemery's positions was, however, the shift of etiological explanations from a generically mechanical level to one that was more consonant with the specificity of living creatures, that ist to say, to the organic disorders that attacked the germ even before it had seen the light of day: "a proprement parler, les Monstres sont autant d'exemples des maladies organiques qui peuvent survenir ' un Foetus qui ne fait que de naitre, et qui n'a point encore vil le jour.""8 An etio- logical analysis in terms of a disease implied, first and foremost, that teratogenesis was necessarily a process." This shift within the accidentalist camp helped to accentuate further the clinical bias of the approach. For not only did it urge scholars to pay greater attention to details, but it also left more room for possible 'repairs of the clock'. It allowed, if only theoretically, for the possibility that the physician might treat the disorder. Such an idea would have seemed blasphemous to the members of the opposing camp, for whom monsters were beings that were intentionally created by God. The idea that the natural order excluded variations, but permitted instead illnesses and displayed surprising resources of refunctionalization, was unthinkable for those who believed in original monstrosity. For here, the extreme confines of the -1 See Tort, L'ordre et les monstres, 53. 36 See ibid., 105-106. 7 LUmery, "Troisieme memoire," 233.

On closer inspection, one is forced to conclude that Lemery was in truth proposing-uninten- tionally, in all likelihood-an epigenetic theory of monstrous forms which he pressed into his framework of preformistic genet- ics. Asked to settle a curious theological dispute over a two-bodied monster to which extreme unction had to be given-once or twice? -, one of the most famous anatomists of the time, Jacques- B&amp;nigne Winslow, entered the debate in 1733. For the following ten years, he breathed new life into the theory of original mon- strosity.40 Winslow's writings carried the mark of authoritative mod- eration, but LUmery took his position at once to constitute a radi- cal attack on his own party. Winslow's first publication dedicated comparatively little space to the case Duverney had described and to a comparison with LUmery's theory. Its focus was instead constituted by a report on the dissection carried out on the double monster, a report that was quite realistic and full of macabre details.4' The attack was power- ful, based on an excellent knowledge of the anatomical material, and boldly erected on the assumption of the autosufficiency and incontestability of anatomical observations, that is, on the second- ary nature of philosophical and religious reflections. Metaphysical reasons were invoked merely as testimony and confirmation and no longer as criteria for building and judging a theory, as had pre- viously been done on all sides of the controversy. At the dissecting 40 See J.-B. Winslow, "Remarques sur les monstres, t l'occasion d'une fille de douze ans, au corps de laquelle etait attachee la moitie inf6rieure d'un autre corps; et t l'occasion d'un faon ' deux tetes, diss6que par ordre du Roy.

There was thus sufficient evidence to persuade all those who wanted to be persuaded. The physician Lemery could certainly not keep up with Winslow at the anatomical level, but this weakness, of which he was prob- ably aware, did not overly concern him. In his eyes, the problem of monsters was not a matter of anatomy, but a purely ideological question. It was the moral appropriateness and metaphysical ad- equacy of one's interpretation to establish one's position in the field-a view that boldly challenged physico-theological ap- proaches. For every argument of Winslow's in support of the ge- nius revealed in the monster's constitution, Lemery found a counter-argument to show just how gratuitous it was. The theory of his opponent implied the defeat of divine intelligence, which it was blasphemous to consider fallible: "ce desordre devient moralement impossible dans le cas des oeufs originairement monstrueux, oui rien n'auroit di^ se faire qu'en consequence d'un dessein regulier, puisqu'il seroit 6mane du Createur."42 The dispute was thus of a mainly theoretical nature, being a clash between two models of scientific explanation and between two incompatible ways of viewing the meaning and the aims of research, without no intermediate position being possibile be- tween them. The differences between the two approaches were too fundamental to be resolved by the production of new positive data. For even if such data had become available, they would still have been explained according to the two opposing schemes, and with- out ever shaking the respective frames of reference. Neither side was able to perceive any truth in the adverse position. And given the impossibility of gaining access to either the monstrous primor- dial germ or to the operations of the accidental causes in the womb, the proof of both theories could, in the end, not be but metaphysical. The positive findings of scientific research provided merely an increase ("surcroit") of demonstration, to be added to one's argument for good measure.43 In the course of the dispute, Winslow failed to perceive the above-mentioned evolution in L6mery's theoretical position and continued to target his first, rigid formulation, which relied en- 42 L6mery, "Sur les monstres. Premier m6moire," 270. 43 See Tort, L'ordre et les monstres, 97-98.</page><page sequence="20">22 MARIA TERESA MONTI tirely on collisions and forced entries, contractions, and squashing. Winslow shifted the dispute to the case of the situs inversus which, as I have already mentioned, constituted the most difficult case for the accidentalist. The perfect and total transposition of his organs had not prevented the soldier Jean Mace from reaching a vener- able age in perfect condition.4 But L6mery was not intimidated by this argument. His answer was that there was no reason why the case of soldier Mace should not be considered the result of God's direct intervention, as all about him was harmonious and in excel- lent form. In other words, Mace was simply no case of a monster.45 For L6mery, the definition of a monster included an afflicted body, which worked badly or not at all, and which was destined to meet an early, if not an immediate, death: l'individu qu'on suppose venu d'un oeuf monstrueux, ne survit guere a sa formation, ou s'il le fait, c'est avec une difficult6 ou une impuissance de remplir les fonctions dont les autres individus de la meme espece s'acquittent facilement et comme il faut.46 By contrast, the body of Jean Mace showed no signs of suffering, nor was its capacity for living reduced. Furthermore, the observed anomaly was perhaps only statistical; maybe it was only the scarcity of available anatomical material to have made this case appear such a rarity: "ce fait n'est point unique, on en rapporte plusieurs autres exemples, et si l'on ouvroit un plus grand nombre de Ca- 44 Winslow, "Remarques sur les monstres," 374 and 377: "M.

"4 L6mery, "Quatrieme m6moire," 519-520: "En comparant la construction particuliere de ces Hommes singuliers avec celle des Hommes ordinaires, oui voit- on que la conformation des uns soit plus selon l'ordre de la Nature et les viies du Cr6ateur, qu'elle soit plus parfaite, et qu'elle ne soit pas au fond exactement la m6me que celle des autres?

However, in 1742, and more clearly in 1743, Winslow signaled that there existed some small hope of reconciliation.49 For he had been affected by a doubt regarding the general framework hitherto ac- cepted by all without hesitation. He had always combined his be- lief in the "extraordinaires originels"50 with an acceptance of the theory of pre-existence, not because the latter was a particularly fertile principle, but because of the perceived weakness of the al- ternative models. But now, he began nurturing doubts concerning the pre-existence of germs prior to fertilization. Struck by contem- porary observations on animal regenerations, he preferred to sus- pend judgement on what was, and remained, a question of specu- lative embryology.51 However, the very possibility that the original monster only became monstrous after the intercourse of the two sexes actually opened up a considerable space for natural causa- tion, and it possibly weakened the dogma of the passivity of nature. It is hard to imagine what L6mery would have said about this. Unfortunately, he died before he could see his opponent assailed 7 Lemery, "Quatrieme memoire," 517. 48 Ibid., 521. 4 See Winslow, "Remarques sur deux dissections." See also "Remarques sur les monstres. Cinquibme et derniere partie."

Because of the way in which Winslow had organized his own strategy in the controversy, the elements of his proof had, from the very beginning, seemed to work much more against accidentalism than in favor of the originality of monsters." He appeared to have accepted preformation only because of the general dislike of the age for any concept involving the mechani- cal formation of extra elements, strange anastomoses, or vascular deviations. His reflections on the attempts at a classification of monsters and on their reduction to relatively homogeneous groups moreover weakened the key idea of singularity which were characteristic of theories attributing monsters directly to God's free intervention. In a certain sense, Winslow multiplied the concessions he made to the opposing theory. But LUmery's mechanicistic explanations opened up dynamically to a general conception of the living crea- tures which centered on their natural disposition toward the reorganization of vital functions. Winslow, perhaps frightened by consequences he had but glimpsed, broke off the confrontation in a position that was least congenial to him. Echoing the Agustinian standpoint, which was not at all original but theologi- cally unassailable, he returned to the celebration of the infinite liberty of the creator which he found his adversaries were seeking to diminish.53 Neither was God a watchmaker, nor was the world a clock whose mechanism could be perfectly understood by man. Both objectively and subjectively, human knowledge was too lim- ited for one theory to be excluded completely in favor of another. Accidents were thus certainly a possible cause, but one had either to succeed in demonstrating this by anatomical means or else to suspend one's judgement and instead render homage to the Omnipotent: "it is not up to us to know why God has given these extraordinary configurations to some organisms rather than to others."54 For God, 52 See Tort, L'ordre et les monstres, 60. 5 Winslow, "Remarques sur deux dissections," 118-119: "Je crois pouvoir de- mander [...] lequel des deux sentimens honore plus le souverain Estre, ou de soitenir qu'il a une raison particuliere de sagesse de faire ce qu'il le fait et comme il le fait, ou de dire avec d'autres, qu'il est arrit6 dans le cours de ses loix generales par des causes secondaires ou occasionnelles, qui empechent l'execution de ses premiers desseins? C'est pourtant l'inconvenient dans lequel sont forcez de tomber ceux qui ne trouvent rien de digne de Dieu, s'il ne fait partie de loix uniformes. De plus, leur systeme ne semble-t-il pas admettre quelque sorte d'impuissance dans le Tout-puissant?"

Chance, epigenesis and preformism in Haller's teratology In both Winslow's and Lemery's last published contributions, we clearly notice the presence of a new person on the stage of the querelle: Albrecht von Haller, the physiologist from Bern. Although Haller had sided with the partisans of original monstrosity, he completed the process of emptying the very term "monster" whose beginnings we have seen in LUmery's denial that the situs inversus constituted a case of monstrosity. Indeed, Haller's preformed monsters would have fitted the usual representations of this cat- egory only with great difficulty. And naturally, to empty the term meant to empty the concept. For, according to him, monsters rep- resented new real species which, in their own ways, expressed God's wisdom and omnipotence and provided a shining example of His infinite freedom of choice. Haller believed that God created all kinds of living archetypes and ensured that they had the qual- ity of life most consonant with the peculiarities of their anatomy. The monster incarnated a project and a purpose that made the idea of its accidental origin blasphemous. Only monsters bearing some analogy to already existing stereotypes, i.e. which generally possessed anomalies by defect, were genuine products of accident. In other words, the category of original monster was to be limited to deformities by excess and transposition, that is, to those organ- isms that showed definite signs of their capacity to survive and which had only functional handicaps that could be overcome." Up to this point, Haller's contribution to the querelle must be 5" Ibid. "6 A. von Haller, "De monstris liber primus [-secundus] historicus [- physiologicus]," in Opera minora, emendata, aucta et renovata, 3 vols. (Lausanne, 1762-1768), vol. III (1768), 173: "Monstrum malum physicum esse dicitur absque demonstratione. Infinitissima pars seminum ad maturitatem pervenit, reliqua dispereunt. Major pars infantum prius interit, quam possint animi dotes ad Dei voluntatem utiliter expedire. Nihilo plus in germine alienae fabricae vitii, est quam in abortu. Estque forte aliqua tamen monstrificae fabricae utilitas. Non impedit in plerisque vitam, et animi usum.

Its novelty and importance lay elsewhere. First of all, Haller was the only contributor to the querelle who, at least during a certain period of his life, dealt with problems of teratology while at the same time placing some hope in the future of epigenesis. And yet, perhaps more interestingly, his teratological works remained unaffected, and his opinions ba- sically unmodified, by his various changes of opinion on matters of embryology, which went from animalculist preformism to epi- genesis and from there to ovist pre-existence.57 In fact, Haller was able to include in all serenity, in the last volume of his Opera mi- nora, a very recent Liber de monstris, together with the revised, but fairly faithful versions of all the teratological writings he had pub- lished over the previous thirty years. Haller's first intervention in the domain of teratology was a re- port on a double foetus he had dissected in 1735, i.e. during the period of his adhesion to animalculism.58 From that autopsy on- ward, Haller was to show no further doubts regarding the survival possibilities of that monster "biceps et unicorporeus" (fig. 4). It consisted of conjoined twins who had died a few days after a birth that had occurred at the end of a regular pregnancy. They had autonomous heads, limbs, and a large hypogastric region, but were joined at the thorax. The abdomen, which they shared down to the level of the navel, revealed upon dissection two digestive sys- tems, one liver (although with one lobe of impressive propor- tions), two sets of sexual organs and a single, rather large spleen. There was nothing exceptional in the conformation of the parts, except for the unusually large size of those single organs that had to provide for two.bodies. It was, however, the opening of the tho- "7 The analysis of Tort, L 'ordre et les monstres, 139-191, fails to do justice to this, because the author attributes to Haller's last choice for ovist pre-existence those teratological pages Haller wrote in his first animalculist period and, what is even more misleading, also those contributions he composed during his adhesion to epigenesis.

For he found that a single pericardium concealed just one heart, which was much larger than usual, but lay in a cen- tral position best suited to ensure a perfect distribution of the blood to the two bodies. The circulatory apparatus, too, showed the kind of mixture of normality and peculiarity that seemed best suited to enhance the creature's chances of survival. Unlike others before him, Haller did thus not stop at the level of anatomy. He underlined how every structural deviation had to correspond to a physiological peculiarity, which also demonstrated the predetermination of the monster in the best possible way. The decisive point for Haller was that in the twins there existed only one heart, which was the precondition for the genesis of all other organs. Anatomical observation, coupled with embryological re- flection, appeared to offer the most evident and original proof that there had never been two germs, and hence no squashing or fusing by mechanical contingencies. Quite on the contrary, the accidental penetration of two germs, that is of two hearts, would have immediately and necessarily led to death.59 One might have expected that the explanation of monstrosity by mechanical causes in the manner of Lemery was a sign of natu- ralization in this domain of embryology. And yet, it was precisely with Haller, this champion of the doctrine of original monstrosity, that teratology took a real step forward. In fact, the decisive factor lay not in any metaphysical prejudice, but in the observation, dur- ing autopsy, of a single functioning heart in twins. The theological overtones only helped to strengthen an argument that had arisen out of, and undoubtedly belonged to, a purely scientific discourse. 9 Ibid., 54: "Cor fuit duarum puellarum unicum, sed cor in rudimentis foetus perficitur in primis; ante cor pars nulla vivit. Non ergo fuit ullum tempus, in quo puellae distincta vita vixerunt. Nullus ergo coalitus fieri potuit, sed in primis staminibus, aeterna naturae lege, duo in unum adunata corpora fuerunt. Fuit ergo hoc non casus monstrum, sed exemplar novi creaturarum generis, et docu- mentum, qua ratione divina sapientia et alias formas hominum suo in genere possit efficere perfectissimas et felicissimas. Nihil enim fuit toto in corpore, quod non ad suam ideam collimaret; nihil temere projectum, sed ad bicipitem unicorporeamque speciem configuratum. Annon idem sentiendum de plerisque partubus, qui infami monstrorum nomine naturae errori tribuuntur? Nonne et illi, specimina potius diffundentis se in diversissimos archetypos divinae sapien- tiae?"</page><page sequence="27">EPIGENESIS OF THE MONSTROUS FORM 29 It is difficult to assess just how much Haller knew about the ongoing debate in 1735. At any rate, four years later, when he edited an upgraded version of the report on the twins (Hannover, 1739), he left the anatomical description intact, but now carefully specified the originality of his explanation with respect to Wins- low's.60 He also subjected the text to extensive elaborations, en- hancing it with eight figures and reworking it stylistically. Impor- tantly, he also added over one hundred bibliographical notes, al- most as if to prove and stress his complete historical and theoreti- cal mastery of the subject. During the 1740s, Haller also took the inevitable stand against poor L6mery, largely on the basis of Winslow's reactions.61 What was new and interesting about his position were not the arguments in themselves, but the fact that, for the first time since the querelle had reached the core of the matter, one of its protagonist was at the same time developing an epigenetic theory of embryogenesis.62 But despite his new epigenetic views in embryology, Haller was not even now in any way taking sides with the accidentalists, as his new sympathies might have led us to assume. Instead, he somehow succeeded in reconciling epigenetically successive formation with the originality of the monstrous form in the germ. After L6mery's death and precisely during the period of his most unhesitating adhesion to epigenesis, Haller indicated with great clarity the rea- sons for his deep-seated aversion to the accidentalist theory: it was " Boschung, "'Une manifestation de la sagesse'," proposes a historical, criti- cal confrontation between the different editions of this work. 61 See A. von Haller, Albertus Haller [...] disputationem inauguralem qua duorum monstrorum anatome continetur indicit (G6ttingen, 1742); A. von Haller, Dissertatio anatomico-medica inauguralis in duorum monstrorum anatomen et de causis monstrorum ulteriorem disquisitionem exhibens (Gottingen, 1742); A. von Haller, Albertus Haller [...] ad disputationem inauguralem [...] invitat suamque et Winslowi de monstris sententiam contra [...] Lemery novis argumentis defendit (G6ttingen, 1745); A. von Haller, Albertus Haller [...] De fetu humano septimestri sine cerebro edito agit dissertationemque [...] De puerperarum mania et melancholia [...] habendam indicit (G6ttingen, 1745). 62 On the complex evolution of Haller's embryological theories see R.

Once more, the num- ber of bibliographical references had increased. It almost ap- peared as if the scrupulous collection of historical examples had to play the role of a substitute for experimental investigations, which were in this case impossible. From all this, it becomes evi- dent that it was not the choice between epigenesis and pre-exist- ence that lay at the heart of Haller's teratological concerns, but the rejection of chance interventions in the process of develop- ment, which he found unacceptable. Throughout his career, the rejection of all incursions of chance remained the true constant. He first formulated this view in the period of his belief in animalculist preformism, developed it further during the years of his adherence to epigenesis, and started to combine this position with his regained faith in preformism (1757-1758) only when he had become fully persuaded of the tolerance of epigenesis toward chance. The fact that the supporters of both accidental and origi- nal monstrosity equally attempted to avoid insulting God seems to have been of marginal importance to Haller. For over fifteen years, Haller found himself pursued over the issue of the etiology of monsters by his friend Charles Bonnet, a champion of ovist pre-existence and, just like LUmery, stubbornly opposed to original monstrosity. In his exchange of letters with Haller, Bonnet made metaphysico-theological blackmail alternate with loquatious appeals for a firm stand against "l'hypothese trop commode""4 of original monstrosity, and with certain concessions to Haller's viewpoint which were, however, merely rhetorical de- vices. Apart from the broad range of his arguments, there was nothing very original in Bonnet's accidentalist theory with respect to L6mery's old mnmoires.65 His initial resolve was not to touch on 63 Haller, "De monstris sententiam," 10: "Cogitet [L6mery] denique periculosam et faventem impietati se docere sententiam, posse nempe a caeca causa, omnique intelligentia destituta, qualis casus est et fortuita pressio, fabricas oriri organicas, paresque naturalibus. Invenerunt certe hi viri qui accidentales causas defendunt aliam causam, quae faciat aequalia creatis, digitumque aemulum digiti Omnipo- tentis." 4 0.

In his eyes, the case of monstrosity was, concep- tually speaking, similar to that of regeneration. For all that was needed was a set of favorable contingent circumstances to set off the most suitable development of the disseminated germs or some morphogenetic power able to trigger off compensation processes. Like LMmery, Bonnet allowed only for one single exception, namely for the situs inversus, the most difficult problem for accidentalists, whose nature as a true monstrosity had, however, in the meantime frequently been challenged. The exchange between Haller and Bonnet on teratogeny was initially limited to merely contingent allusions, usually in the con- text of their discussions of hybrids, of the role of the male in ovist pre-existence, and of the germ's development prior to fertilization. It only became a central issue starting in 1763. The dispute inten- sified between 1766 and 1768, as Haller was revising his writings on monsters, but continued even beyond the publication of De monstris. Haller's final position limited the concept of 'real monster'. Even he had now come to accept chance anomalies, but he rigidly excluded them from the category of 'monstrosity'. At the same time, he was resistant to Bonnet's attempt to establish the possibil- ity that the intervention of a chance accident could not only con- dition, but indeed construct, a monster. Haller's De monstris was not simply a compilation of old views, accumulated thirty years after the end of his own observations. Instead, its author offered new considerations and a critical refinement of his own positions.67 M.T. Monti, Bonnet et les 'poulets' de Haller.

But Bonnet finally agreed that con- sidering God the author of the monstrous germ or of accidental causes basically made little difference at the level of apologetics, recognising that, all things considered, his friend was arguing in good faith. Haller always managed to find a rejoinder, even catch- ing Bonnet out on his favorite ideological ground, invoking hu- man ignorance of God's final ends and reappropriating the Augus- tinian theory, which set omnipotence against wisdom. All one could do was to return to the old theological distinction between moral evil, which was truly repugnant to the Lord, and physical evil, which was not without some purpose and was consequently also a sign of the hand of God. Haller's aim, which he largely achieved, was, at any rate, to relegate the metaphysico-theological argument to a matter of secondary importance with respect to the embryological factor. In the light of the course the controversy had so far taken, with Winslow's pseudo-anatomical objectivity and Lemery's theoretical boldness, Haller's priorities clearly helped to turn things upside down. ABSTRACT The present essay analyzes an eighteenth-century phase of the querelle des monstres and highlights two main points. 1) As the cases of L6mery and Winslow demon- strate, in the period when preformation was the dominant view, the dispute over the origin of monsters carried into the very field of preformation the contrast which had originally opposed it to the now defeated model of epigenesis, namely the alternative between mechanical genesis and pre-existence of the monstrous form itself. 2) One of the most important episodes in the shift of teratology from a primarily theological or metaphysical issue to a purely natural one was due to Albrecht von Haller. Haller shifted the dispute from anatomy to embryology; and it is on an embryological base and not on metaphysics that he built his own dem- onstration of the original nature of the monster. He was furthermore the only scientist of authority who dealt with teratology from an epigenetic standpoint. His numerous changes of view in the field of embryology did in fact never affect his early adherence to the thesis of original monstrosity.</page></plain_text>
