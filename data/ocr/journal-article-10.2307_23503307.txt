<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES The Pool of Israel by Ben Zion Luria At the beginning of the Via Dolorosa, near the Lion Gate, there is a large field which, only a generation ago, was a pool by the name of בריכת ישראל. Its length, east to west, is 110 m.; its width, from the street (Via Dolorosa) to the northern Temple Mound wall is 38 m. \t one time a valley cut through the location of the pool, starting from about the Rockefeller Museum and the Flower Gate, cutting across the Temple Mound and descending into the Kidron Valley. The pool reached a depth of 21 m. and held 100,000 cu. m. of water. However, many years have gone by since the pool was used as a water reservoir. It was turned into a dumping place for refuse for the region around it and was eventually filled in. A small street stretches today from the Lion Gate to the Gate of the Tribes of the Temple Mound, which corresponds to the eastern limit of the pool. A team of the Palestine Exploration Fund discovered an underground structure below this street which was used to regulate the water level of the pool to avoid overflowing into neighboring houses during the rainy season. Through this structure overflow waters would drain down into the Kidron Valley. Apparently, this pool was used in ancient times to purify the Temple offerings. In its waters the sheep and the cattle would be washed before being brought to the place of the sacrifices. Herod, who constructed the Antonia as a fortress for himself, enlarged the ancient pool up to the Antonia, in order to keep a watchful eye on the activities within the Temple Mound confines, thus defending his position at the eastern side. According to the description of Josephus of the conquest of the city by Titus, it is reasonable to assume that the name of the pool was Amigdalon— אמיגדלון. Christians took the pool to be the location of the miracle of Jesus at the Pool of Hisda, but church people in the past generation have transferred the locus of that miracle to another pool, located inside the courtyard of Saint Anna Church. Jews lived in the vicinity of the pool and northward during the first Muslim period, keeping watch over the north wall of the city. 306</page><page sequence="2">There are a number of wall inscriptions in old houses and names of places which relate to the Jewish community there, such as the Pool of Israel, the Gate of the Tribes, the Levite House, and the like. After the expulsion of the Crusaders, Saladin established a seminary for dervishes in the area of Saint Anna Church־ and he handed over to them the stores of the Spice Market for their financial needs. He also gave them the Hamam-el-Batrak for the support of a second seminary of theirs. The Pool of Israel was not the Wakf of Saladin's seminaries, and if the Wakf claims it today, it is subject to basic scrutiny lest there be an attempt here to appropriate property that does not belong to them. Substitution of Anthropomorphisms in Ancient Translations of the Bible by A.J. Brawer "God created man in His form and image" (Gen. 1 :26), but the Bible, in the Ten Commandments and in other places, forbids any image or likeness in any visual form whatsoever (Deut. 4:15-18 and others). Isaiah declares to his people : To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare unto Him (Is. 40:18)? To whom then will you liken me, that I should be equal, saith the Holy One (Is. 40 :25)? Job asks God : Hast Thou eyes of flesh (Job 10 :4)? And yet, anthropomorphisms are numerous in Scriputres. Wings are attributed to angels and even to God in metamorphic expressions. In the Talmud and Midrash, the anthropomorphisms go even further than the text in their interpretations of Scriptures. The ancient trans lations tend to avoid personifying the Deity -— the Aramaic translations most often; the Septuagint and Peshitta deviate somewhat from the literal translation; the Vulgate only in some verses; but in some in stances, the Vulgate exaggerates the anthropomorphisms in order to sharpen the text. The article adduces examples of the various parts of the human body or of birds attributed to God as they fit the usage of language, in line with the Talmudic adage: The Torah speaks in the language of men. But since meanings change and literal translations might lead to mistaken notions (e.g. God who draws His sword or shoots His 305</page><page sequence="3">arrows), the translations modify the text, at times by elaborating the interpretation and at other times by abbreviating it. Generally, the Qnkelos translation is brief while Jonathan is lengthy. In order to avoid personification of the Diety, the translations substitute the following for the name of God : מימרא דיי — יקרא דיי — שכינתא דיי — דחלתא דיי — שמא דיי. Since God is everywhere, the translations will substitute "angel of God" in place of "God" ; likewise, "the enemies of God" is translated : "the enemies of God's people." An illustrative contrast between the text and its Aramaic translations with regard to the personification of God is found in Genesis 6:6 — And the Lord repented that He had made man, and it grieved Him at His heart. Onkles translates this verse thus: And God retracted His word wherewith He made man on earth, and declared His word to break man's strength, as He willed. Onkelos mentions מימרא twice; but there is no trace of "heart" or "grief". The Jonathan and the Jerusalem translations interpret this verse likewise, but with minor changes. The Septuagint does not mention "heart", but the "Mind of God". "Then God laid it to heart that He had made man upon the earth, and he pondered it deeply" (Septuagint, Bagster Edition). The Peshitta translates this verse literally. The Vulgate has it thus: Poenituit eum quod hominem fecisset in terra. Et tactus dolore cordis intrinsecus,... — God was very sorry that He made man and pain struck in His very heart. This represents an acute anthropomorphism. A Soldier's Prayer by Dov Rappel Contrary to the opinion of many modern (19th and 20th cent.) commentators and scholars, the author of this paper thinks that Psalm 84 was composed originally by a soldier, not by pilgrims or refugees. The allusions to the Temple and to the way or movement can be well explained by the pilgrim-theory, not so the relatively numerous allusions to military action. The author of the Psalm seems to be a man with very strong emotional ties to the Temple. He is with the army somewhere far from Jerusalem and the Psalm expresses his longing and hope. 304</page><page sequence="4">The Multiliteral System of the Verb in Medieval Hebrew by Nehemya Allony Jehuda Hayyüg (Cordova, 10th and 11th century) discovered the homoliteral system of the verb: each root has not less than three letters. Did another system of the verb exist before this system of homoliteral roots ? There is no doubt that־ before Hayyüg, there existed another system, the so called multiliteral system : each root may have one, two, three... up to seven letters and exists nouns, but as verbs they may have from one to five letters only (or at least four letters). This system existed throughout the Middle Ages, from the 7th-11th centuries in the East, the so called Tiberian philology, and afterwards in Europe for several centuries more. The oldest document containing the theory of the multiliteral system is the Sefer Yezira (Book of Creation), which according to some scholars was written in Erez Israel during the second century, the Tannaitic period (Epstein, Ginsberg, Shalom and his disciples), and, according to other scholars, was written in the eighth century, during the Gaonic period (Kraus (Paul), Steinschneider and Zunz). The author disputes many of the conclusions of the article "Medieval Hebrew" by Mrs. E. Goldberg ( = Gog) in the entry "Hebrew Langu age" in the Encyclopedia Judaica, XVI, Jerusalem 1972, col. 1607— 1642. 1. According to Gog the Hebrew language was dead during the Middle Ages (cf. J.B. Michaelis, Beurtheilung der Mittel, welche man anwendet die ausgestorbene hebraeische Sprache verstehen zu lernen, Göttingen 1757). 2. According to Gog, only single verb forms exist as biliteral ones: 'As (ttj)• 'Az (עץ); S'a (סע). 3. There are no verb forms as: Ya'üs (יעוש) Ya'uz (יעוץ) Yasü'a (יסוע) ; Kamajta (קמית). According to God this serves as a proof against the multiliteral system, but this in fact is no proof against this system at all. 4. Gog denies the existence of a multiliteral system of the verb. 5. Only a few grammarians such as Menahem and Dunash did not know the homoliteral system of the verb. 6. Even Menahem and Dunash did not use the multiliteral system of the verb in their own writings. 7. Only a few Pavtanim used the multiliteral system. 8. Rav Se'adya Gaon knew the homoliteral system very well. 303</page><page sequence="5">9. The use of biliteral roots has to be explained by the shortening of some forms such as ma'ala — ma'al; ma'ase — ma'as; behala — bahal ; the so called tafkhim (תפכיים) ; taqzir (תקציר). Appendix The Complete Anagrammatical Lexicon of the Threeliteral Roots Many fragments of a complete anagramatical lexicon of the three literal roots are dispersed in many libraries which house Cairo Geniza fragments. In this appendix are listed five fragments of this work: 1. Cambridge, T-S. NS. 302/74. one folio : ארה — אש; 2. Cambridge, T-S. NS. (—■), 2 folios; באת — במת; בתן — גאח ; 3. Cambridge, T-S. NS. (—•), 1 folio; זבס — וצל; 4. London, Ms. Os. 5560 C, Fol. 1-10 ; גבר — גמק; 5. London, Gaster Collection, Ms. Or. 10152, one folio ; דאב — דאה גאף—גאת. Altogether five fragments ... 15 folios ... 300 entries, containing parts from letters Alef to Waw. All the roots are listed in a vertical column and only those forms which exist in Hebrew (Biblical and Medieval) are listed together with translations and quotations. This lexicon may have been composed by a student during his youth, and has many shortcomings. (See facsimiles of two pages; British Museum, Geniza, MS. Or. 5560 C). אם לא שלח ידו במלאכת רעהו by Y. Bergman The expression — אם לא שלח ידו במלאכת רעהו appears only twice in Tenakh, both in a similar context — Exodus 22 :7 and 22 :10. This does not refer to theft — that is, seizing another5s possessions stealthily; nor does it mean robbery — that is, by force. Such interpretations would not fit the passages where the phrase ...שלח ידו ב appears, which phrase fits the meaning of damage or injury in those other instances. In our verse (in Exodus) the reference is to damage done in the process of work or use made by a guardian to whom an object or animal was entrusted. This phrase then is connected with the laws of the שומר. The שומר does not intend to damage the object — but just to make use of it, without permission. The expression thus does not refer to theft or robbery but to unlawful use of objects entrusted to a guardian. 302</page><page sequence="6">The Character of Adonijah by S. Zalewski The article deals with the personality and character of Adonijah. It seems that the deposed contender for the throne was a clever and cunning man who resorted to sophisticated and varied strategies to achieve his end. His ambition was to seize the kingship, to be attained by his request to take Abishag, the Shunammite, for his wife, this despite the fact that she enjoyed no royal status, neither as wife or concubine of David. Thus Solomon's decree to execute him was lawful. A Compendium ofMidrashim to Ruth 1:1 by M. B. Lerner In this article, the author publishes fol. Ill of MS. Add. 19, 787, located in the Library of the British Museum, London. This selection has been identified by G. Margoliuth (Cat. vol. II, p. 357, no. 697 IV), as 'Fragments of a Recension of the ילקוט שמעוני on Ruth'. Actually, this compendium has no bearing whatsoever on the Yalqut Shimeoni of R. Shimeon Ha'Darshan and represents the independent effort of an anonymous scribe or writer who compiled midrashim for the Scroll of Ruth. However, this effort was not crowned with success as the writer did not even manage to finish his compilation of the material dealing wit h the first passage. The text is accompanied by notes, and reference is made to the following sources: Babylonian Talmud, Ruth Rabba, Ruth Zutta and Tanhuma Mishpatim. The writer is shown to have exhibited his skills in editing the material at his disposal. His texts were found to contain some interesting variants. On the other hand, he was also guilty of scribal errors and lacunae which have been emended in the notes. Joseph Kimchi, Bible Commentator by Yaakov Gil Joseph Kimchi was the first commentator in Southern France to use the philological-critical approach in the interpretation of the Bible, 301</page><page sequence="7">and his two sons, Moshe Kimchi and David Kimchi continued in his path. In his writings we find many original and correct interpretations. He elucidated difficult passages by pointing out missing words or letters, or inverted verses and letters. He paid attention as well to the style of the Bible, to the pairing of syllables, to parallel expressions and the like. Joseph Kimchi often sought the novel in his interpretations. This led at times to wrong conclusions. He also wrote introductions to the Biblical books. His works had an appreciable influence upon the Biblical commentators of the Middle Ages. Regretfully, with the advent of printing, most of his writings were overlooked and thus disappeared from the scholarly world. Psalm 110 by David S. Shapiro The 110th Psalm is interpreted as a royal Psalm originating from the early days of King Azariah (Uzziah), perhaps from his very coronation at the age of sixteen. The young king is eager to go forth to battle against the enemies of Judah who have taken advantage of the death of King Amaziah at the hands of assassins; but a divine vision restrains him (verse 1). God will send forth his victory from Zion, while the entire nation is pouring forth its prayers in the Temple (cf. verse 3 with Psalm 119, 108) and volunteering its services in readiness to strike at the enemies on the day of the king's birth (i. e. coronation; cf. Psalm 27—6 ־, Isaiah 9, 6). For his ascent to the throne the people had hoped from his very birth, and now, in the full bloom of his youth, he is given royal honors. As king he will be like Melchizedek, the ancient king of Jerusalem, who blesses his victorious people when they return from battle and who blesses the Lord who gave them victory (cf. Genesis 14, 18—20; also 2 Samuel 6, 14—18). Like the priest-king of old, the youthful king will welcome the warriors returning home. (The image of the king as Melchizedek may have led King Azariah to his later usurpation of the priesthood.) God who is at the king's right hand strikes the heads (i. e. the kings) of the nations who ride triumphantly over dead bodies (cf. S. R. Hirsch). The head of Judah (i. e. its king), however, will drink from the waters of salvation (cf. Isaiah 12, 3) as God raises him aloft. 300</page></plain_text>
