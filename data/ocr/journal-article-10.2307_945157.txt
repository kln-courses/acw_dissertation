<plain_text><page sequence="1">32 Book Reviews into) the private corners of their lives (she converses with Danuta Lutoslawski too), their recent burning of personal letters and sketches to frustrate zealous biographers, the passion for his stepson and 'grandchildren', his two homes in Oslo, his early struggles against poverty. He reveals his plans to write an opera, but will not allow its subject to be revealed, and discusses ballet, literature (Conrad and Gogol), artists and architects. It is an unassuming book of great delight, with 25 photographs mainly from family albums, a list of works that includes at least two not to be found in Rae (what is the Lulaby [sic] for Anne-Sophie, 1989?), a discography and full listing of his awards, degrees and prizes - including the Polar 'Nobel' (Stockholm) and Kyoto (Tokyo) prizes which were awarded only a few weeks before his death. Lutoslawski needs no more now than to be listened to. Patric Standford Intimate Letters. Leos Janaciek to Kamila Stosslovd, edited and translated by John Tyrrell. Faber &amp; Faber, ?25.00. Early inJuly 1917, in the gardens of the Moravian spa of Luhacovice, Leos Janacek saw a young, dark-haired woman lying on the grass, 'like an exhausted little bird who doesn't yet know how to fly'. Although she was 26 years his junior and apparently happily married, he immediately fell in love with Kamila St6sslova, and for the remaining dozen years of his life she was his muse, his 'hoped-for wife' and mother of his imaginary children. Their meetings were rare, and his love was not 'consummted' until nearly ten years after their first encounter, when he at last addressed her by the second person singular pronoun Ty. Their first kiss occurred four months later, a year before his death at the age of 74. Most of this has been known for a long while, as has the fact thatJanacek wrote to Kamila often; his Second String Quartet, one of his most direct avowals of love for her, is entitled 'Intimate Letters'. Some of these letters were quoted in an early biography, but his widow objected to any further publication and access to the corres- pondence was restricted for 60 years until a complete edition of Janacek's side of it appeared in Czech in 1990. Dr. Tyrrell's translation abbreviates the earlier documents (a lot of them are literally bread-and-butter letters - Kamila's husband had connexions which enabled him to supply the Janaceks with flour and butter during shortages after World War I), includes more of Kamila's letters than the Czech original (where only a few appear, in footnotes), and provides absorbingly detailed linking narrations, explanatory footnotes and appendices. The importance of the correspondence can hardly be overstated. This was the period of Janacek's last and greatest operas (at least two of which, Kat'a Kabanova' and The Makropoulos Affair, are 'about' Kamila), of the Glagolitic Mass, the Sinfonietta and the Diary of One who Disappeared, whose central figure, the dark, alluring gipsy, is another portrait of her. More even than that (Kamila was often the first to hear of a planned new work), the letters reveal Janacek's personal- ity more graphically than any other source but his music. Although he at times accepted that his 'marriage' to Kamila was a fantasy (but 'this imaginary world is as necessary for me as air and water are for my life'), the letters are often touchingly beautiful. His description to her of his imperative need to create - 'Just as you have to breathe and someone were to stop up your mouth. Just as you need the earth and someone were to take it away from underneath your feet' - is paralleled by his frustration to allow the relationship to go beyond an occasional kiss: 'Just to look at the sea - and not bathe in it; full dishes - but no spoons, forks, knives, not even fingers! To want to sing - but just to croak. To drink - and an empty glass'. The fantasy and the frustration formed his music and he knew it: 'the notes would like to slide along the moist lips of my Kamila - and they have sit on the paper! That's why my compositions have become so wild'. Kamila herself remains mysterious. Her own letters - very few of them; she drove Janacek to distraction with her failures to reply - suggest an ill-educated woman (Dr. Tyrrell has translated her kindly, refraining from English mis-spellings to match her own in Czech) who had little understanding of or interest in Janacek's music. She wounded him by her repeated failure to respond to his invitations to performances. Although she kept his letters she mutilated them. Some are represented by their envelopes only, others have pages or parts of pages cut out with scissors or isolated words obliterated. Janacek knew she was doing this and seems to have found the prospect an exciting challenge: he writes of her mouth or of kisses and says he know she will cross it out. One or two phrases that she has missed give perhaps the flavour of what she destroyed: he tells her of a dream of 'your beautiful breasts, and I kissed you at your heart'. Most of the photographs show her as plain and prematurely stout (Janacek liked that: it enabled</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 33 him to fantasize that she was pregnant). Some of her letters to him are uncomprehending, even cruel: she tells him that she's glad he's so old, otherwise her husband would forbid the corres- pondence; she reproaches him for his treatment of his wife. But what could have become the tragi-comedy of an old man making a fool of himself over a woman unworthy of his interest is redeemed and made genuinely beautiful by his recognition of a soul that she hardly knew that she had, and by her confused, rare but moving responses to this. I've not known anything else I've not longed for anything else my life just went by without love and joy. But I always went along with the thought that that's the way it had to be. Now I think that God was testing you and me and when he saw that we've been good and that we deserve it he has granted us this joy in life. If you told anyone he wouldn't believe that I've perhaps waited for you that all my life I'd found no one who would offer me his love. I steered clear of everything I didn't look for anything and you were the only one in all the years you've known me and that really is the truth. In more than one sense Janacek 'composed' Kamila. It was the artist who had perceived the soul of the seemingly icy and egocentric Elena Makropoulos who reached out to Kamila St6sslova's ('my soul' was his favourite way of addressing her). In these letters we come very dose to the sensibility that made him a great composer. Dr. Tyrell's lucid translation and his linking text turn the book also into a most touching and compelling love-story. During his last two years Janacek wrote to Kamila almost daily. He also kept an album, a commonplace-book of thoughts and brief musical compositions, intended as a keepsake for her when they were apart (it is as yet unpublished). Its penultimate entry, before the onset of his last illness, reads: And I kissed you. And you are sitting beside me and I am happy and at peace, In such a way do the days pass for the angels. Michael Oliver Francis Poulenc by Wilfrid Mellers. O.U.P. Oxford Studies of Composers, ?25.00 (hardback). There are aspects of this book which might almost excuse one coining the monstrous pun, 'Les Mellers perpetuels'. For present are such familiar ingredients of the Mellers style as the author's enthusiasm for anthropomorphic descrip- tions of key functions; psycho-ritual contexts (locating the music within its anthropological environment - in particular, relating its content to a perceived ritualistic significance); and some curious, perhaps even eccentric critical interpret- ations. The trouble is, as this Poulenc study demonstrates, that the Mellers strategy can seem to suit some subjects less effectively than others. Here, it might partly be because of a problem of scale; a longer length might have allowed him to develop a more widely-drawn context that would have illuminated his analysis of individual works. But all too often these descriptions seem almost perfunctory, and in only a few cases does the familiar acuity shine through. This is more than a pity, for as Mellers declares in his preface, the motive in writing this short monograph was 'an act of love'. It is a beau geste of an appropriately Poulencian sort, and I am sorry that I came away from the experience with hardly any relishment. Meller's thesis about Poulenc is most clearly gathered in the concluding chapter. Under Satie's influence, Poulenc the youth achieved small acts of child-like transcendence, while in his middle years he wrote conservative music which yet contained 'new truths within accredited conven- tion'. But the theme of the major works of his last decade was 'transcendence in the specifically religious sense'. The opening chapter sets a specifically Satiean context. Here, it would seem, the concern is to establish the centrality of Satie for Poulenc, rather as an aesthetic lodestone to which the composer would always return: the reasons for Poulenc's durability. . . are inseparable from the fact that he, while still a boy, recognized as did no other Parisian composer what Satie's music was 'about'. The recognition was not conscious; Francis simply knew that Satie must be a father-figure to him... Earlier, Mellers describes Satie's music as 'Child- like but not childish... unusually free of the detritus of sentiment, and of memory and desire - and therefore of past and future'. But Poulenc's music is essentially about the act of memory, and so is inextricably bound up with what that implies in terms of sentiment. Unleashed, such sentiment certainly produced indulgent moments, but Poulenc's oeuvre is saved by a balance of extremes that can be explained in terms of the dichotomic nature of the composer's personality. Poulenc expressed himself as 'Janus- Poulenc' through some instructive oppositions, such as the painters Mantegna and Zurbaran, portraits of himself by Cocteau and Berard, and in his own music, by setting the entertainment Le Bal masque' against the Stabat Mater. Satie represented an obvious corrective at the austerity</page></plain_text>
