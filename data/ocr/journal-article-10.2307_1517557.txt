<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vetus Testamentum XXXVII, 4 (1987) AN EXAMINATION OF SOME A'ITTEMPTS TO DEFEND THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS1 Part I by J. A. EMERTON Cambridge It has been widely agreed for over a century that the flood nar- rative has been composed by combining two sources known as J and P. The reasons for believing that more than one source has been used are, not only that God is sometimes referred to as Elohim and sometimes as Yahweh, but that there is much duplication and even contradiction. In addition, different parts have affinities with different sources that have been detected elsewhere. I shall not, however, say much about such affinities, but shall be concerned primarily with evidence within the flood narrative itself for the use of more than one source. The detailed arguments for source analysis are set out in a number of works, such as the commentaries of Dillmann, Holzinger, and Gunkel,2 and there is no need to des- cribe them in detail again here. It is, however, worth mentioning that the two most important of the alleged discrepancies within the narrative are the differences in chronology and in the number of creatures taken into the ark: the rain fell forty days and nights according to J, but a hundred and fifty according to P; and Noah was commanded to take into the ark a pair of every kind of creature according to P, but seven pairs of every clean creature and one pair of every unclean creature according to J. 1 I am grateful to Dr G. I. Davies and Dr H. G. M. Williamson for reading and commenting on a draft of this article. 2 A. Dillmann, Die Genesis Leipzig, 1875); H.

EMERTON Although the analysis of the flood narrative into J and P has been widely accepted, it has been challenged by some scholars, chiefly those of a conservative religious outlook. The purpose of the pres- ent discussion is to examine several challenges, those by U. (M. D.) Cassuto, E. Nielsen, F.I. Andersen, G. J. Wenham and Y. T. Radday-and Nielsen's writing is certainly not inspired by a con- servative view of biblical inspiration. Before the writings of these scholars on the flood narrative are examined, it is appropriate to make two points. First, fault is sometimes found with critical scholars for having recourse on occasion to the hypothesis of a redactor to whom some words may be ascribed, and it is suggested that such an hypothesis tends to undermine their arguments. Indeed, their resort to the hypothesis is sometimes even made the occasion for what is little less than mockery. Against such an objection, it must be firmly stated that the hypothesis of a redactor is reasonable and can be the best solution to a problem that faces all scholars. For example, there is good reason to distinguish between two different accounts of the number of animals that Noah is commanded to take into the ark. If a verse appears to confuse these two accounts, then there is a problem that needs to be solved. One solution is that a redactor has been at work. If a scholar thinks he can advance a better, or even an equally satisfactory, explanation, then he may offer it as an improvement on, or substitute for, the hypothesis of a redactor (and if he cannot, he had better refrain from finding fault with it). His attempted explanation must then itself be examined to see whether it is satisfactory. If it is not, then it is reasonable to postulate the work of a redactor. After all, those who believe that the flood narrative is the result of the combination of two sources believe, ex hypothesi, that there was a redactor, and there is nothing absurd in finding his hand at work in some places. What is absurd is to reject the hypothesis without providing a satisfactory alter- native. Secondly, it will be helpful to consider next whether there is a discrepancy in the chronology. A problem in the chronology of the flood narrative One of the reasons for the analysis of this part of Genesis into two sources is the alleged discrepancy between the statements about the duration of the flood. According to vii 4, 12, it rained forty days (and forty nights, but the nights will be ignored here for the sake 402</page><page sequence="3">THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS of brevity), whereas vii 24 and viii 3 speak of a hundred and fifty days. The flood is said in vii 11 to have begun on the seventeenth day of the second month; and the five intervening months make up a hundred and fifty days. The two mentions (vii 24, viii 3) of a hun- dred and fifty days appear to refer to the same period. viii 2 records that the springs of the deep and the windows of heaven were closed, and the rain was restrained. If the story is to be regarded as a unity, verse 2 must be dated at the end of the forty days of rain to which vii 4 and 12 refer. According to viii 3, the waters went back con- tinually (wayyasubu ... hdlok wdsob). The samne verse then says of the waters that wayyahseru from or at the end of (miqseh) a hundred and fifty days (and there is no need for the present purpose to discuss the Samaritan reading miqqes in place of miqseh). Verse 4 states that the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, i.e., as we have seen, a hundred and fifty days after the beginning of the flood. We must now ask how wayyahseru in viii 3 is to be understood. The Revised Version renders this part of the verse "and after the end of an hundred and fifty days the water decreased", and the Revised Standard Verion has "At the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters had abated". It is questionable whether a waw consecutive with an imperfect may legitimately be regarded as having a pluperfect meaning, but the RSV may be offering an idiomatic English rendering of what would be literally "and ... were lack- ing". But viii 3 does not refer to the end of the process of the waters decreasing or abating, for viii 5 describes its continuation: "And the waters decreased continually (hady hdlok wehadsr) until the tenth month" (RV). It is therefore probable that the consecutive imperfect wayyahseru in viii 3 is used in the same ingressive sense as wayyimlok, "and he began to reign", in 2 Sam. x 1; 1 Kings xi 25, etc., and that it means "and...began to decrease" or "abate", i.e. the process began as soon as the sources of the flood were cut off. The chronological system that speaks of a hundred and fifty days (= five months) thus sees that period as elapsing between the beginning of the flood and the beginning of the decreasing in viii 3. How can the hundred and fifty days be related to the forty days of rain in vii 4, 12? It is natural to understand viii 2 to refer to the time when the rain stopped. If the story is a unity, then viii 2 refers to the end of the rain forty days after it had started. Are we to sup- pose that a hundred and ten days elapsed between viii 2 and the 403</page><page sequence="4">J. A. EMERTON beginning of the process of decreasing in viii 3? That seems unlikely after the reference in viii I to God making a wind pass over the earth and the statement wayydsokku hammdyim. The natural way to understand the course of events (if the story is a unity) is that God sent the wind and stopped the rain and the surge of waters from beneath, and that the process of decreasing began at once, and not more than three months later. It is thus improbable that a hundred and ten days are represented as passing between viii 2 and wayyahseru in viii 3, and there seems to be a discrepancy between the references to forty days and a hundred and fifty days. Is an alternative explanation possible? Is it possible that, although viii 5 speaks of the continued receding of the water after viii 3, the verb wayyahseru in viii 3 refers, not to the beginning of a process, but to a particular stage in the receding, namely, the stage at which the waters had gone down sufficiently for the ark to rest on the mountains of Ararat (viii 4)? Did the process of receding begin in viii 1-2 and continue in viii 3 until it was possible to say "the waters decreased"? Such a way of understanding the passage is difficult. First, to understand wayyahseru absolutely of just one stage in a continuing process seems strained, and less likely than the view that the verb has an ingressive sense. Second, it is difficult to reconcile with vii 24, which says that the waters prevailed (wayyigberu) upon the earth a hundred and fifty days. The flood waters remained on the earth for more than a hundred and fifty days, according to viii 5 ff.: after the ark had come to rest on the mountains of Ararat, the waters continued to recede, and earth was not dry until a year or more after the beginning of the flood (viii 13-14; cp. vii 11). It would be strange if the waters were said to "prevail" only until the bottom of the ark touched a mountain, although even the tops of the mountains were not yet visible (viii 5) and the earth was still covered by water for several more months. It is unlikely that the hundred and fifty days refer to the period of the rain and part of the rest of the time of the flood. On the other hand, if the hundred and fifty days are the period which began when the rain first fell and water came up from beneath and which ceased immediately after viii 2, the reference to prevailing is intelligible.3 3 The RV and the RSV both translate the verb gbr by "prevail" here and in vii 18-20, but W. Baumgartner, Hebrdisches und aramdisches Lexicon zum Alten Testa- ment I (3rd edn, Leiden, 1967), p. 168, suggests "zunehmen" in these verses, and 404</page><page sequence="5">THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS There is thus a strong case for the view that the hundred and fifty days are the period between the beginning of the flood and viii 2 when the rain stopped. There is a discrepancy between the hundred and fifty days of rain and the forty days of rain. The discrepancy can be plausibly explained on the hypothesis that two sources have been combined. (1) Umberto Cassuto U. (M. D.) Cassuto sought in several publications to defend the unity of the flood narrative against the theory that it is a combina- tion of the accounts in the sources J and P. The subject is discussed in his books La Questione della Genesi (Florence, 1934), The Documen- tary Hypothesis and the Composition of the Pentateuch (Jerusalem, 1961) = twrt htcwdwt wsydwrm sl spry twrh (Jerusalem, 1941), and the two parts of A Commentary on the Book of Genesis (erusalem, 1961 and 1964) = m'dm Cd nh and mnh Cd 'brhm (erusalem, 1944 and 1946). I Against any attempt to analyse the flood story into sources, Cassuto advances a positive theory of its composition in Comm. II, pp. 30-3. He claims to find a "finished structure" which "cannot possibly be the outcome of the synthesis of fragments culled from various sources; for from such a process there could not have emerged a work so beautiful and harmonious in all its parts and details" (p. 34). Cassuto divides the section into twelve "paragraphs": I vi 9-12; II vi 13-22; III vii 1-5; IV vii 6-9; V vii 10-16; VI vii 17-24; VII viii 1-14; VIII viii 15-17; IX viii 18-22; X ix 1-7; XI ix 8-11; XII ix 12-17.The first six paragraphs tell of disaster, and the second six show "us consecutively the various stages of the act of Divine com- pasion that renews life upon earth" (pp. 30-1). The divisions between some of Cassuto's paragraphs are in natural places, and yet his general arrangement is by no means obvious, particularly the New English Bible has "swell" in vii 18 and "increase" in the other verses. In vii 24 the context suggest the meaning "was high" or the like (cp. the LXX's U'o90ir in vii 20, 24). Dr G. I. Davies, who drew my attention to this point, sug- gests that gbr is the antithesis of hsr in viii and that, if it means "be" or "become high", it strengthens the case for the view that the hundred and fifty days were the period during which the rain fell and the flood increased and became deeper (vii 24). 405</page><page sequence="6">J. A. EMERTON since the paragraphs vary considerably in length. For example, there is a case for including vi 5-8 in the story of the flood; paragraph VII could easily have been sub-divided; it is far from self-evident that the divisions between VII and VIII, and between VIII are IX are correct. Cassuto, however, makes some comments that are probably intended to reinforce his division into paragraphs. Thus, he says that I ends with Cal-ha)dres, and that the same phrase is repeated at the end of VI, although its appearance in vii. 24 is not, in fact, at the end of the verse. Similarly, at "the end of each of the four intermediate paragraphs of the first group [i.e. II-V] there occur parallel expressions that indicate Noah's obedience to God's instructions" (p. 31). In the second group, each paragraph ends with hdadres, and VIII and XII have the preposition Cal before it. One cannot but wonder, however, what kind of a symmetry can be detected by Cassuto when I, VI, VIII and XII have Cal-ha'dres, and VII and IX-XI ha'dres, whereas II-V agree together in having in common a reference to Noah's obedience (which is not always expressed in identical words). The supposed pattern exhibits more lop-sidedness than symmetry. Nor is Cassuto's attempt to find "a concentric parallellism between the two groups" (p. 31) impressive, particularly since it often fails to correspond with the alleged pattern of paragraphs. The decision at the beginning of the story to bring a flood and the resolve at the end4 not to do so again (Cassuto fails to mention viii 21 in this connexion) are at the natural places in the narrative and are scarcely signs of accomplished literary artistry. The same may be said of the command to enter the ark and later to leave it again, of the description of the course of the flood at the end of the first group and of the end of the flood at the beginning of the second, and of the use of sht in I and II and also in XI and XII (and, in any case, the examples of sht are all in passages ascribed to P, and so cannot tell against the theory of source analysis). Cassuto finds significance in the fact that God is said to see (ra'd) in I (vi 12) and XII (ix 16), but the contexts are different and it is doubtful if there is any significance in the fact. Moreover, Cassuto himself compares the use of rdad in vii 1 and ix 14, but these verses are in III and VII, 4 Presumably ix 15. Comm. II, p. 31, refers to "the end of the second" group of paragraphs. 406</page><page sequence="7">THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS which do not correspond to each other. It is also questionable whether it is significant that the word "generation(s)" is used in I (vi 9) and XII (ix 12) in different contexts-and Cassuto finds no place in his pattern for the same word in vii 1, which is in III; or that a covenant is mentioned in II (vi 18) and XI (ix 9, 11) and XII (ix 17, to which ix 12, 13, 16 should be added): while II may balance XI, it does not balance XII. Cassuto points out that the subject of food and the word 'okld appear in vi 21 and ix 3, but paragraphs II and X do not correspond to each other. The reference to clean animals in vii 2 (III), 8 (IV) and viii 20 (IX) may, in a loose sense, be said to be in "the middle of the first and second groups of paragraphs", but only III matches IX, and IV does not. Cassuto claims that in the first group (I-VI) "the period of seven days is referred to first, then that of forty days... and finally that of one hundred and fifty days", and that the periods are mentioned in the reverse order in the second group (VII-XII). In fact, things are not so simple. The order is seven (vii 4, III), forty (vii 4, III), seven (vii 10, V), forty (three times: vii 10, 12, V; vii 17, VI), and a hundred and fifty (vii 24, VI) in the first group; and in the second, a hundred and fifty (viii 3, VII), forty (viii 6, VII), and seven (viii 10, 12, VII). The order in the first group is thus not right. Moreover, the references in the first group are distributed among III, V and VI, but those in the second are all in VII. The paragraphs also fail to balance in the indication of "the date by reference to Noah's age" (p. 32) in vii 6 (IV), 11 (V) and viii 13 (VII), and in the references to the windows of heaven and the springs of the deep in vii 11 (V) and viii 2 (VII)-and that leaves only the mention of the mountains in vii 19, 20 (VI) and viii 4, 5 (VII). In addition, Cassuto draws attention to "numerical harmony" (pp. 32-3). The significant number seven appears in references to seven days (vii 4, 10, viii 10, 12) and seven pairs of clean creatures (vii 2-3), and God speaks to Noah seven times (vi 13, vii 1, viii 15, ix 1, 8, 12, 17). It is, indeed, possible that the fact that there are seven divine utterances to Noah is significant, though it is also possible that their number is fortuitous. Yet there is nothing sur- prising in the fact that the number seven is mentioned of certain matters, and the fact scarcely testifies to literary artistry in the story as a whole. Incidentally, the seven days and the seven pairs of clean animals are all in verses ascribed to J. More dubious is Cassuto's 407</page><page sequence="8">J. A. EMERTON argument that cd'd is used seven times in II "in connection with the construction of the ark" (all seven references are ascribed to P), for in this paragraph the two uses of the verb in vi 22 very likely have a more general sense of doing what God commanded (cf. vii 5) than the specific sense of making the ark or its parts as in vi 14-16, and Cassuto fails to say that the verb cdas is used elsewhere in the flood narrative (vii 4, 5, viii 6, 21, ix 6) and that these other occurrences do not number seven. Similarly, although bw' is used seven times in II, all the references are ascribed to P, and Cassuto does not mention vii 1, 7, 9, 13, 15, 16, viii 9, 11, where there are more than seven references. The seven uses of sht all occur in P (vi 11, 12, 13, ix 11, 15-see above). The seven references to berlt in XI and XII are also ascribed to P, but Cassuto says nothing in this context of the fact that the word is used only once, not seven times, in II (vi 18), although he has earlier (pp. 31-2) found significance in the cor- respondence of II and XI (see above). Cassuto now turns to multiples of seven: 21 references to water, 14 uses of basar (vi 12, 13, 17, 19, vii 15, 16, 21, viii 17, ix 4, 11, 15, 16, 17-these all belong to P), and the 35 occurrences of Noah's name. The sex- agesimal system is also fitted into the pattern: Noah's age is 600; the alleged paragraphs are 12 in number; "the word flood occurs" 12 times-but mabbul occurs in the flood narrative only 8 times (vi 17, vii 6, 7, 10, 17, ix 11 [bis], 15), and the references in ix 28, x 1, 32, xi 10 are outside that narrative. Cassuto can also find 12 references to "the various categories of living creatures...phrased in twelve different ways" (vi 20, vii 2-3, 8, 14, 21, 23, viii 1, 17, 19, 20, ix 2, 10), if "two general expressions at the beginning and at the end" (p. 33) in vi 19 and ix 16 (and ix 12, 15) are excluded. I have given reasons above to question the validity of many of Cassuto's arguments concerned with "numerical harmony", and it may be doubted whether the remaining examples are deliberate or suffice, even when taken together, to establish his case. Cassuto's attempt to establish that there is an "architectonic structure" in the story of the flood (and even his delimitation of the section) has thus failed. It cannot be used against an analysis of the narrative into sources. II One of the principal criteria for the source analysis of the flood story is the use of the different words for God: the use of Yahweh 408</page><page sequence="9">THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS points to J, and the use of Elohim to P. Cassuto has discussed the question at length, and seeks to explain the variation without resort to the theory that different sources can be detected. Elohim is the generic term for deity and was originally a common noun, whereas Yahweh has a specific sense as the proper name of the God of Israel. Starting from that basic distinction in meaning, Cassuto lists thirteen rules in The Documentary Hypothesis, pp. 31-2, which, he believes, govern the use of Yahweh and Elohim in the Pentateuch. When "two opposite rules apply together and come in conflict with each other; then...the rule that is more material to the primary pur- port of the relevant passage prevails" (p. 32). Cassuto's theory as a whole fails to convince me, but I shall confine my remarks to the flood story. The Commentary I, p. 87, selects three rules that are particularly important for Genesis, and Part II, pp. 35-6, sum- marizes their application to the flood story, as does also The Documentary Hypothesis, pp. 35-6. Since the flood narrative "speaks of the God of the whole world, not of the specific God of Israel, and the tradition of the Flood is found also among non-Israelites", it is natural to expect Elohim to be used, "and the Tetragrammaton appears solely when there is a special reason for it" (Comm. II, p. 36). Yahweh appears in four contexts in the flood narrative. First, in vi 5-8. According to Cassuto, the tetragrammaton is used here because "the moral motive...is accorded special prominence and emphasis" (Doc. Hyp., p. 36). Second, the appearance of Yahweh in vii 1 is explained as due to "the moral motive" (ibid.). Moreover, vii 1 and 5 occur in a context where sacrificial animals are men- tioned (Doc. Hyp., p. 36), "and wherever oblations are referred to we find the name YHWH" (Comm. II, p. 36). Third, vii 16 ("and Yahweh shut him in") "reflects the personal and direct... relation- ship of a Father full of compassion towards his cherished son" (ibid., p. 36; Doc. Hyp., p. 36). Fourth, viii 20-1 again mentions sacrifice (and the mention in viii 21 alludes to iii 17 in a narrative where Yahweh is used). Cassuto's argument gives rise to some difficulties. If vi 5-8 uses the name Yahweh because of the moral interest, why does it not appear in the similar vi 11-13? Moreover, vii 1, where the name Yahweh is used, appears no more ethical in emphasis than vi 9, where Elohim is found. Similarly, if the statement in vii 16 that "Yahweh shut him in" uses the tetragrammaton because of a "per- 409</page><page sequence="10">J. A. EMERTON sonal and direct relationship", it is strange that it is Elohim who "remembered Noah" in viii 1, who "blessed Noah and his sons" in ix 1, and who made a covenant with them in ix 8-and there are other passages that one might expect to be covered by Cassuto's rule. Thus, although in vii 1 it is Yahweh who tells Noah to enter the ark, Elohim appears in vii 9, 16 in the account of the entry which is said to be according to God's command (which Cassuto presumably understands to refer back to vii 1, where the name Yahweh appears-and vii 5 uses Yahweh in a similar context), and also in the command to leave the ark in viii 15-16. Yet the relation- ship involved is scarcely less "personal and direct". Further, while viii 15 is not in a context that specifically mentions sacrificial animals, viii 17, 19 refer to the animals which, on Cassuto's view, include some for the sacrifice, which is mentioned in the nearby passage viii 20-1. Cassuto's theory about the reasons for the decision when to use Yahweh and when to use Elohim are unconvincing when applied to the flood story. It does not offer a satisfactory alternative to the theory that material from two sources has been combined. III Cassuto discusses in La Questione della Genesi, pp. 96-147, the lex- ical differences between J and P. Most of those that he discusses do not concern the flood story and may be ignored here. The only one that is relevant is the distinction between zdkdr uzneqeba (vi 19, vii 9, 16), which is ascribed to P, and izs we)isto (vii 2), which isJ. Cassuto discusses the differences in La Questione, pp. 99-101, and in Comm. II, pp. 36-7, 73-4. He argues that, if vii 2 had had zdkdr uzneqeba after sibCd sibCd, "the respective number of males and females" would not have been clear (Comm. II, p. 74), whereas 'is we)isto shows that there must have been an equal number of each sex; the same expression occurs later in the verse for the sake of parallelism. Cassuto does not explain why the meaning is, ex hypothesi, left unclear in vii 3, which has sibCd sibCd zdkdr uneqebad, but not fis weisto-and, of course, Cassuto does not follow the scholars who believe that the text has been expanded here.5 Despite the defi- 5 There is no need to discuss fully here the problem of the text and meaning of vii 3. Cassuto thinks that it means that Noah was to take seven pairs even of unclean birds, so that he could later send out a raven: he did not know how many 410</page><page sequence="11">THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS ciency in Cassuto's argument, this is probably his strongest case, but I suspect that, even if zdkdr zuneqeb had been used in vii 2, it would have been natural to understand the command to refer to males and females in equal numbers. In any case, this alleged linguistic criterion concerns a difference that involves only one verse in J. It must be considered alongside other lexical differences listed by, for example, Holzinger, p. 68, such as mdha (vi 7, vii 4) in contrast to sht, and met (vii 22) in contrast to gdwa' (vi 17, vii 21), and kol-yequm (vii 4, 23) in contrast to kol-bds'r (vi 13, vii 21). Such differences may have little weight when considered individually, but they acquire a cumulative force when they correspond to other evidence to distinguish sources. Cassuto notes that the arguments of some scholars make use of affinities between certain parts of the flood narrative in Genesis and other parts of the Pentateuch that are ascribed to J or P. I believe such arguments to be justified in principle, provided there are good grounds for the analysis elsewhere, and the use of divine names is a good example. I shall not, however, discuss such matters further here, because I am concerned primarily with evidence within the flood narrative itself. IV One of the arguments advanced against the unity of the flood narrative is the number of repetitions. Cassuto lists thirteen in La Questione, pp. 36-7: (1) vi 5 and vi 11-12; (2) vi 6-7 and vi 13; (3) vi 5-8 and vi 9; (4) vi 17 and vii 4; (5) vi 18-20 and vii 1-2; (6) vii 7-9 and vii 13-16; (7) vii 10 and vii 11; (8) vii 17 and vii 18(-20); (9) vii 21 and vii 22(-23); (10) viii 2a and viii 2b; (11) viii 13b and viii 14; (12) viii 6-12 and viii 15-16; (13) viii 21-2 and ix 8-17. Cassuto points out that repetition is common in the literature of the ancient Near East. Indeed, some matters are mentioned more than twice in the flood narrative, and yet few, if any, scholars would ascribe each mention to a different source. "Reference is made", for example, "to the increase of the water no fewer than birds might be lost, and he did not want any species to become extinct (Comm. II, p. 76). Cassuto did not observe that this generous provision of all kinds of unclean birds (not just ravens) implies a surprising lack of foreknowledge in God, who gave the order in vii 3. Of course, in any case, if any of the unclean animals died in the ark, the species would have become extinct, but no provision was made for that eventuality. 411</page><page sequence="12">J. A. EMERTON six times in chapter vii" in vv. 17, 18 (bis), 19, 20, 24. "If we insist on applying the analytical method consistently, we shall reach a stage of absurdity" (Comm. II, p. 38). Moreover, repetitions are not redundant, for "whenever the text reverts to a given subject it tells us something new" (p. 38). Thus, vi 6-7 records God's intention to destroy mankind, but vi 13 informs Noah of his decision (cp. Yahweh's decision not to destroy man again in viii 21-2, and the informing of Noah in ix 8-17); and vi 18 tells Noah to enter the ark at some time in the future, whereas vii 1 commands him to do so immediately. Further, Comm. II, p. 78, refers to "the literary expe- dient of first making a general statement and thereafter setting out the details"; that is supposed to explain the repetitions in (6) vii 7-9 and vii 13-16, (7) vii 10 and vii 11, and (9) vii 21 and vii 22(-23). It may certainly be agreed that not all the repetitions demand the explanation that two different sources were used, or, indeed, say precisely the same thing as their counterparts. Nor can it be said of most repetitions that they make no sense at all. Those who accept the analysis of the story into J and P are not bound to hold that the redactor who combined them was invariably an unthinking dolt. Nevertheless, the number of repetitions cannot but raise the suspi- cions of the scholar, particularly when they are reinforced by other criteria favouring the hypothesis that more one source was used. Further, not all Cassuto's arguments are convincing. For example, I cannot find in vi 11-12 anything substantially new in relation to vi 5 (1). Again, the allegedly general statement in vii 7-9 (6) and the setting out of the details in vii 13-16 occur with three verses separating them. Yet the ancient Near Eastern analogies cited by Cassuto (Comm. I, p. 91) have no such intervening material: the Babylonian Creation Epic III, line 138, is followed immediately by IV, lines 1-2; and the same is true of the Ugaritic text V AB (CTA 3). i. 4 end-7, which he cites in BJPES 10. 2-3 (1943), p. 48. In (12) Cassuto distinguishes between, on the one hand, hhdrebz hammayim mecal ha-dres and hdrebiu penea hda-ddma in viii 13, and, on the other, ydbesd ha-dres in viii 14; he supposes that viii 13 means that "there was no longer a layer of water over it [sc. the face of the ground], but the ground was still wet", and viii 14 that "the earth was dried out". It is questionable whether such a distinction between hrb (even with pene hda-'ddma) and ybs can be justified. Thus, although Cassuto can show how most of the examples of repetition are not strictly inconsistent with one another, some of his 412</page><page sequence="13">THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS arguments are weak. Moreover, the cumulative force of the repeti- tions, especially when combined with other evidence, still seems best explained by the hypothesis that two sources have been combined. V Cassuto discusses, and tries to explain, five alleged discrepancies or contradictions. It is unnecessary to spend much time on two of them. It may be granted that there is no necessary discrepancy between the statement in viii 5 that "the tops of the mountains were seen" and viii 9, which says that "the dove found no place to set her foot". Nor can we press as if it were certain (though I still regard it as probable) the argument that Noah's attempt to discern whether the land was dry so that he might leave the ark (viii 6-12) conflicts with his later leaving the ark at the command of God (viii 15-17). The other three arguments are not so easily overcome. First, there is the argument that in P Noah is commanded to take a pair of every kind of animal into the ark (vi 19-20, vii 14-15), whereas J makes a distinction between unclean animals, who are to go in pairs (vii 2-3), and clean animals, who are to go in seven pairs each (vii 2; cp. viii 20). Cassuto seeks to explan this apparent con- tradiction with the help of an ingenious theory. He notes that the verb bo), "to enter" in the qal, appears in vi 20, vii 9, 15, 16, and is used in the hiphcil in vi 19, always of animals that come each in one pair, whereas ldqah, "to take", is found in vii 2 with reference to seven pairs of animals. "In other words, those creatures that felt an inner urge to come to Noah of their own accord in order to be received into the ark, and were permitted by Noah to enter (vi 19: You shall permit to enter [literally, 'bring']), comprised two of each kind, a pair. Apart from these, Noah was commanded to take addi- tional pairs from his flocks and herds and the birds that he could catch, which he could use, ... without endangering the existence of these species" (Comm. II, p. 39). Further, vii 8-9 raises a difficulty for those who divide the narrative into two sources. Since vii 8 distinguishes between clean and unclean animals, as in vii 2, which uses the name Yahweh, it should be J, but the use of Elohim in vii 9 points to P. Moreover, the number "two" is here used of clean as well as unclean animals contrary to the supposed opinion of J, and he does not use the phrase "male and female". Many scholars 413</page><page sequence="14">J. A. EMERTON therefore postulate the work of a redactor, and some also accept the Samaritan reading (with some support in the versions) yhwh in vii 9. But Cassuto regards appeal to the hypothesis of a redactor as arbitrary. Instead, he thinks it confirms his opinion that two of each kind of animal entered the ark of their own accord, in addition to the seven pairs who were taken by Noah. There is, however, no need for me to repeat here the justification that I offered above (p. 402) for postulating the work of a redactor when that seems the best way of solving a problem, and we have also seen (p. 410) that Cassuto's own theory leads to an unresolved problem in vii 3 where he does not postulate an addition. Cassuto's theory is open to objection. First, one may ask why a pair of every unclean creature entered the ark voluntarily. The answer given by Cassuto would presumably be that they were impelled by God to do so. Why, then, did not God impel the addi- tional seven pairs of each clean creature to enter, and thus save Noah from the long and difficult task of trying to catch such a large number of creatures? Did they know that they were destined to be sacrificed or eaten? Even if they did, was it thought beyond the divine power to inspire them to enter the ark (cp. 1 Sam. vi 7-12)? Cassuto's ingenious theory seems implausible. Further, he has overlooked an important fact in vii 2. Cassuto bases his case on the fact that tiqqah is used here of clean animals in distinction from unclean animals who come (bo^) voluntarily and are permitted by Noah to enter the ark. He does not appear to have noticed that tiqqah applies also to the unclean animals in vii 2, and thus the whole theory based on the use of two different verbs collapses. Second, it is usually held that J attributes the flood to rain (vii 4, 12, viii 2), whereas P goes further: not only are the windows of heaven opened, but the springs of the deep are cleft open (vii 11, viii 2). (I shall leave on one side for the moment the forty days and nights, which are thought to belong to J's chronology.) Cassuto objects that, on this theory, J's view of the flood is simpler, whereas P has "the more poetic and arresting potrayal", and that fact "con- flicts with the traits that are considered to be typical of the two sources" (Comm. II, p. 40). If, however, it is suggested that P "is only quoting verbatim a still older source ... there is no further need for dissecting the text". He suggests that vii 11 is, indeed, a quota- tion "of the ancient poetic source" to describe "how the mighty cataclysm began", and that "subsequently, Scripture must relate in 414</page><page sequence="15">THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS what manner and for how many days it continued". He explains the fact that the "text makes no further mention of the water that flowed from the fountains of the deep" by stating that "the earth was already covered by a layer of water and the augmentation that came from below was not visible; consequently there was no reason to speak of it" (p. 40). Cassuto's explanation of the failure of the narrative to mention the waters from beneath in vii 12 looks like special pleading. If vii 12 is intended to tell "in what manner and for how many days" the flood continued, we do not expect a mention only of haggesem, which accounted for no more than part of the flood; and the fact that only the rain could be seen to be coming is not a sufficiently plausible reason for failing to speak of the waters that came up from below. Further, in vii 4 Yahweh says "I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights", but says nothing of the waters coming up from beneath. The fact that the waters from beneath would not be seen to be coming up is scarcely a reason for God to conceal part of his intention. Nor is there anything uncharacteristic in P's reference to the windows of heaven and the springs of the deep. There is no reason to suppose that P's cosmology was different from that of more ancient times, and that he did not believe that there were waters above the firmament and beneath the earth. Gen. i 7 certainly implies belief in the former, and there is nothing to suggest that the latter were not also sup- posed by P to exist. The reference to such waters may be "more arresting" thanJ's mention of rain, but it need not have been more poetic in the mind of P. Third, it must be asked how Cassuto deals with the problem of the apparent discrepancy in chronology between the forty days of rain in vii 4, 12 and the hundred and fifty days of vii 24, viii 3. He believes that viii 2, which tells how the supply of water was cut off and the rain ceased, refers to what happened at the end of forty days (Comm. II, p. 44). He further believes that the forty days are included in the number of the hundred and fifty days (five months "in round numbers"): although the supply of water had been cut off, the earth was still covered by the flood for a long time, and it was not until a hundred and fifty days after the beginning of the flood that "the first sign of the decline of the layer of water was discernible" (Comm. II, p. 44). 415</page><page sequence="16">J. A. EMERTON Cassuto's explanation turns on his interpretation of viii 3, which he translates as follows (p. 98): And the waters receded / from the earth / gradually; And the waters abated / at the end of a hundred and fifty days. The Hebrew of what is translated as the second line is: wayyahseru hammayim miqseh hamissim ume'atyom. His translation is possible (though it was argued above on pp. 403- 4 that an ingressive sense of wayyahseru is more probable), but his interpretation of the verse is open to question: he believes that viii 3 refers, not strictly to the abatement of the waters, but to the time when "the abatement of the waters [was] noticed...became apparent" (p. 102). But that is not what the text says. wayyahserzu may mean "and the waters abated" (more probably "and the waters began to abate"). It does not mean "and the abatement of the waters was noticed". Cassuto can escape the inconsistency within the text only by reading into viii 3 something that is not there, and by interpreting the text in a way different from his own translation. His attempt to postulate a period of time (presumably a hundred and ten days) between the ceasing of the rain in viii 2 and wayyahseru in viii 3 is unconvincing. VI There is thus reason to question Cassuto's defence of the unity of the flood narrative and his attempt to refute the theory that it has been composed from two sources. His argument that the story is "harmonious in all its details" is unconvincing. His attempts to demonstrate an "architectonic structure", to account for the use of the words Yahweh and Elohim and for lexical contradictions have failed. He has not succeeded in providing a satisfactory alternative to the theory that certain problems in the story are best explained by postulating a combination of two sources. (2) Eduard Nielsen In his book Oral Tradition (London, 1954), pp. 93-103, Eduard Nielsen questions the usual analysis of the flood story into the sources J and P. His questioning is all the more significant in that 416</page><page sequence="17">THE IUNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS he is a well-informed scholar who is recognized to have a good judgement and to be free from fundamentalist or apologetic bias. Moreover, he recognizes that the story is "composed of different traditions" (p. 102), but he seeks to explain the story by the use of a traditio-historical method with a stress on oral tradition and is unwilling to resort to literary critical methods. Nielsen questions the "fundamental view" of the source critics and asserts the "improbability of this mode of procedure ascribed to the creators of our Pentateuch" (p. 95). He also questions its methods. Thus, in a criticism of Gunkel he notes that J is regarded as "old, popular, naive legends", whereas P "is characterized by the sober spirit of erudition" (p. 96); and yet "it is the 'sober erudi- tion' that sets the whole mythological apparatus in action when the outbreak of the waters of Chaos is to be described (7.1 1-P), whereas the popular naive story-teller narrates much more 'simply' that forty days of heavy rain caused the catastrophe". He also notes that there is little difference in the representation of Noah by P, who regards him as "only the pale type of a pious man", and by J, for whom he is an "ideal of a pious hero, here especially a hero of faith"; and that Gunkel admits that J's "appearance of Yahweh" in vii 1 "is quite unsubstantial (i.e. neither popular, naive, nor anthropomorphic), and that J's description of the destruction of everything living is colourless, and that an older tradition had des- cribed the Deluge mythologically (7.11 P)" (p. 96), although J also has "very ancient traits", and he concludes that "it is impossible as a matter of course to divide the material into three age groups [in the Pentateuch as a whole] and to distribute the three groups among J, E and P" (p. 97). It is possible to agree with Nielsen in his willingness to recognize that material ascribed to the various sources may come from various ages, and that some things in what may be regarded as the latest source may be older than some in an older source. Some of the points made by him are, however, open to question, whatever validity they may have against Gunkel. First, while it is reasonable for Nielsen, from his modern point of view, to describe P's account in vii 11 of the causes of the flood as "the whole mythological apparatus", there is no reason to think that P would have regarded it in that way. As I have argued above (p. 415) in my discussion of Cassuto's theory, there is no justification for thinking that P's cosmology differed from that of older times. Further, we do not 417</page><page sequence="18">J. A. EMERTON expect J to go out of his way to describe Yahweh in anthropomor- phic terms every time he mentions him, but that is compatible with the claim, on the basis of material in J as a whole, that his picture of God is in general more anthropomorphic than that of P. Nor can we expect him to import colour into his narratives everywhere. Nielsen's criticisms of Gunkel do not invalidate source-critical methods in general. Nielsen next advances the following statement against the source hypothesis: "(1) that the hypothesis is only tenable when it occa- sionally comes into conflict with its own presuppositions, and (2) that solutions arrived at in a different manner account for the com- position of the pericope in at least as convincing a manner" (p. 97). He refers with approval in a footnote to Cassuto's La Questione della Genesi, and states that he partly follows it. Nielsen's evidence for (1) begins by questioning the criteria of divine names and of reduplication. The use of Elohim in vii 9 points to P, but vii 15 records the same action in a P passage. There thus appears to be an example of reduplication that does not serve as evidence of source division. Gunkel solves the problem by postulating the work of a redactor, but Nielsen appears to regard this as an unjustified way of escaping the difficulty and, in any case, as evidence of the source hypothesis coming into conflict with its own presuppositions. Nevertheless, as I argued above (p. 402), there are times when it is reasonable to postulate a redactor (or sometimes a glossator). The problem is not merely the presence of Elohim in vii 9 (where there is evidence foryhwh), or of reduplica- tion. There is also the problem of the number of creatures taken into the ark and the contradictory accounts, and the relation of vii 9 to the different accounts; and Nielsen does not offer an alternative solution to the problem. Nielsen also argues that "it is related no less than four times (7.10, 12 J; 7.11 P; 7.6 P), that the Deluge came upon the earth", but nobody postulates four sources (p. 98). He is right in urging caution in the use of the criterion of reduplica- tion. Yet the four verses that he mentions do not all say the same thing: vii 10 states the point in time at which the flood came, and vii 12 its duration. The purpose of vii 6 is to state Noah's age at the time of the flood, but vii 11 states the fact that the flood came, gives the date, and describes the manner. It may be that Nielsen would agree with my statement about the four verses, and I agree with him on the need for caution in the use of the criterion of 418</page><page sequence="19">THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS reduplication. His argument does not, however, tell against the use of the criterion in appropriate circumstances. It is not a necessary presupposition of source criticism that every apparent reduplication testifies to the use of more than one source. The examples need to be evaluated. A further argument of Nielsen is that P is said to be "distin- guished by its ... very precise chronology", and yet, when the attempt is made to relate the references to time to the lunar and solar years, problems arise and Gunkel concluded that P's hundred and fifty days are "a traditional, inexact figure for five months" (pp. 98-9). I do not wish to go into complicated chronological prob- lems relating to the lunar and solar years in P, but I grant that there may be limits to P's precision. In support of statement (2) Nielsen claims (p. 99; cp. pp. 98, 100-1) that the chronology of the narrative is consistent, and that there is no discrepancy between J and P. In this, the discussion of vii 24-viii 3 is important. Nielsen holds that vii 24 is the conclusion of a passage telling of the destruction of the whole earth: "This sec- tion is very naturally concluded by an anticipatory remark to the effect that the whole catastrophe lasted in all for one hundred and fifty days" (p. 99). viii 2 tells how the supply of water was cut off, and viii 3 says "And after the end of one hundred and fifty days the waters were abated" (p. 99). Nielsen presumably supposes that the rain lasted forty days, and that a hundred and ten days elapsed between viii 2 and viii 3. His interpretation gives rise to difficulties that were discussed near the beginning of the first part of this article (pp. 402-5), and I cannot see anything in his discussion of the passage that meets the objections raised there to the unity of the chronology. There is no need to repeat the arguments here, but it is appropriate to stress that it is difficult to maintain that "the whole catastrophe lasted in all for one for one hundred and fifty days", for the flood waters remained on the earth for more than five months. It is not easy to see why only part of the time that the water was on the earth should be added to the forty days to make a hun- dred and fifty days. It is unnecessary to pursue all the further details of Nielsen's discussion, for most of it is not concerned with the analysis of sources. It is, however, relevant to consider his principal conclu- sions. He beliefs that the story is "a work of art, composed of dif- ferent traditions, it is true, but in such a way that a unified work 419</page><page sequence="20">J. A. EMERTON has been the result" (p. 102); and the author "has tried to compose them into a definite chronological scheme". Further, if "the chronological system has to be connected with P (to use the ter- minology of literary critics), it is no longer possible to regard this P as an independent source beside the older traditions or strata." He does not believe that the author can be described as merely a redactor: "A redactor is a man whose interest is in harmonizing traditions which he has neither created nor supported"-and the author "must quite certainly have been a great artist" (p. 103). Reasons have been given above for adopting a different view of the narrative from the one taken by Nielsen. Some of his arguments are not compelling, and he has not faced all the problems and offered an alternative solution. He has not, for example, solved the problem of the number of animals taken into the ark. Nor has he satisfactorily accounted for all the repetitions; and the repetitiveness and redundancy of expression are scarcely evidence of great literary artistry. The hypothesis of the use of two sources provides a solution for these problems, and it must stand unless a different view of the composition of the story can offer a better account of the evidence. The redactor who combined the two accounts was not without skill, but there is not sufficient reason to regard him as more than a redactor. (To be continued) 420</page></plain_text>
