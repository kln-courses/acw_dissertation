<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ask twenty teachers what could make teaching better, and you will get twenty different answers. However, all should agree on one area of needed improvement and that is student motivation. Whatever happened to a student's true thirst for knowledge? Of course, students do thirst for some knowledge. They want to know who did what with whom over the weekend. They are also interested in "why." "Why do we have to do this anyway?" "Why does spelling count?" Academic motivation can occur, however, if teachers within a school can cooperate to provide interdisciplinary learning experiences. Hill Jr. High has had an outdoor education program for over ten years. As the program has developed each year, teachers have found more activities that have that magic combination for learning- interest, involvement, and what I like to call "lightbulb learning." (You know- when a new idea or revelation causes a light to go on overhead as depicted in the comics.) What is it about outdoor education that makes it motivating to students? Is it just the fact that they are all away from school, wearing comfortable clothes and treating each other like fellow human beings? Does it make a difference that the learning is interdisciplinary? A group of teachers pondered these questions in an effort to cure the winter doldrums (dulldrums) and early spring crazies. We decided to bring Outdoor Education in- into the language arts room, into the science room, and into the social studies room. We started by playing that time- honored game, "What If?" Only instead of using the standard "What Ifs," we posed the question, "What if the Earth could talk?" The idea was to get students to look at nature, the environment, our relationship to the environment, and history from a vantage point that has existed all along. Students were asked to view time, events, and the progress of humans from the perspective of the Earth, trees, or water. Begin with a Song During my years of teaching, I have written quite a few educational songs about everything from rocks to rainbows, dinosaurs to clouds, and many strange things in between. These songs were written mainly to give facts to help students remember details about subjects. I wrote a new song for our indoor environmental unit called Diary of the Earth and Trees not to give facts, but rather to motivate the students to want to find the facts. There are two important factors to remember when using music as a teaching tool in your class. First, only use a song if you like it. Second, you must make the students understand from the very beginning that they are responsible for what is going on in the song. Direct the students' attention and make sure they can see copies of the lyrics if you are going to make them responsible for what is contained in them. On the first day of the environmental unit, I introduced the song. I decided to use a tape of the song rather than singing it live to the students so that the language arts teachers and social studies teachers could use the music later in their own classes. The students were asked basic questions before hearing the song for the first time. It was important that they understood the definition of a diary. They were asked to project ideas. "What might the Earth or trees see that we couldn't?" "What are some of the changes brought about by humans?" "Why would the Earth or trees want to communicate with us?" These questions encouraged students to use their creativity with the understanding that there were no wrong answers. Although the song was introduced in language arts class, the students found themselves relating science, history, ecology, and other subjects in their discussions. They left the first class period with an assignment to make a series of at least three journal entries from the perspective of either a tree, the Earth, a rock, or a body of water. These entries could be three days or 300 years apart. Each entry needed to include the date and a description of an event. Journal Entries The following day, the students came into class and showed each other what they had written before the bell rang! The class sang the song to set the mood, then listened to some of the entries read aloud and commented on them. As teachers, we were surprised at the depth of emotion and understanding shown in the writings. One student wrote an entry as a rock for the year 21 1 2. He described wars, shelters, and acid rain. Another showed a sense of humor when he wrote of a river's experience in upsetting a water skier. The more students heard, the more involved their discussions became. They found that imagining that the Earth had human qualities raised a number of emotions in them, including anger, fear, concern, disgust, joy and sadness, and this new perspective created a desire to know more.* They wanted to know more about humans' impact on the environment, how they could help the environment, and what they could change to stop destroying the environment. Teachers and students alike agreed that the indoor environmental education unit was a success. The students enjoyed learning in a different way, and the teachers enjoyed working together. We all gained a better understanding of the relationships among different subject areas and between what is taught in school and the "real world." You may be able to adapt our ideas to your school and get even better results.
