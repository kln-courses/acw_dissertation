II BUCHLER'S METAPHYSICS I N 1951, Justus Buchler published Toward a General Theory of Human Judgment, an essay which he declared might have been described as "a metaphysics of utterance, were it not for the mischievous associations of the former term and the narrowness of the province suggested by the latter" (i, vii). Since then, three other short books have appeared: Nature and Judgment (1955), The Con- cept of Method (1961), and, most recently, Metaphysics of Natural Complexes (1966).* We are told that each of these essays can be read independently, but it is clear that each of them may also be read as a chapter within a larger structure, as stages in a single project to out- line a comprehensive categorial scheme for understanding man and nature. In attempting to understand and assess what Buchler is saying, doing, and making, we are immediately confronted with a difficult problem of locating a perspective or context for judgment. One's immediate impression of the fabric of Buchler's thought is that it is radically different in tone, method, and terminology from most of the philosophy written during the same period. Most philosophic writing during the past fifteen years has been "school philosophy." By this I mean that in the different areas of philosophy, a cluster of distinctions, problems, and strategies have come into the foreground of discussion. The philosopher who seeks to contribute to ongoing philosophic inquiry has addressed himself directly to these clusters in order to show where distinctions and problems are illuminating or misleading, or how they can be given new applications or need to be modified in some important way. The advantage of this mode of philosophizing is that there is a closely knit dialectic of refining, clarifying, and amending an inherited body of knowledge and opin- * The four books have been published by Columbia University Press.

But the danger of this approach is that the "problems" and "so- lutions" can become sterile. A philosopher like Buchler who attempts to break away from "school philosophy" is taking a serious risk. With the introduction of novel terminology, categories, and distinctions, we may be left hanging in mid-air, unable or unwilling to see their relevance to what has become familiar and accepted in philosophic investigation. And yet this philosophic uneasiness may be the beginning of illumi- nation and a fundamental questioning of presuppositions which are only dimly perceived and rarely criticized. Being forced to think in new ways may enable us to return to the familiar with fresh per- spective and insight. In laying bare the skeleton of Buchler's com- prehensive categorial scheme I shall focus on four interrelated con- cepts, each of which plays a major role in one of his four books: proception, judgment, method, and natural complexes. PROCEPTION Proception is the first major category that Buchler introduces., "The interplay of the human individual's activities and dimensions, their unitary direction, constitutes a process which I shall call proception" (I, 4). The category of proception is intended to suggest a "moving union of seeking and receiving" (i, 4), which are the essential char- acteristics of the human individual. The two dimensions of procep- tion are manipulation and assimilation: each of these processes pre- supposes the other. Typically, Buchler stretches the meanings of these concepts so that they possess the greatest generality. Manipula- tion is not to be identified with adjustment, although active adjust- ment is one variety of manipulation. In the manipulative dimension, the human individual is actor and agent, and the varieties of acting, shaping, molding are indefinite. There is a corresponding generality in the assimilative dimension, for while man is spectator, sufferer, and patient, assimilation does not necessarily involve conscious aware- ness. "We assimilate not just sensible qualities, but advancing age, 1 Buchler justifies the introduction of new categories and the expansion of the meaning of traditional terminology as follows: "The philosopher must either coin new terms, or stretch the 'meaning' of terms in current usage, or combine existing terms in unfamiliar ways. Each of these procedures has its pitfalls and excesses. But there are no other alternatives short of utter vacuity. The problem is to determine the optimum uses and the apt occasions of each procedure. The philosopher esti- mates the linguistic technique which will convey his concepts without sacrifice of their substance.... The responsible introduction or extension of terms, whether in philosophy or science, reflects a conceptual need and serves a conceptual pur- pose.... The unfamiliar philosophic category that has justified itself to its user must counter one resistance by another-the inertia of easy usage by the resist- ance to oversimplification. The growth of nomenclature, provided that it issues from the urgency of query, is a positive good, not a necessary evil" (II, 108).</page><page sequence="3">BUCHLER'S METAPHYSICS 753 changes of modes of thought, and the ethical temper of a society" (I, 18). Anything that affects our proceptive direction can be said to be assimilated by the proceiver. Manipulation and assimilation are in- volved in all proception, and they are ontologically inseparable. We never manipulate without assimilating, nor do we assimilate with- out manipulating. Man is never simply agent or patient, he is always both together. What are we to make of the notion of proceptive direction? Buchler disavows two misconceptions that come to mind. Proceptive direc- tion does not presuppose that there is an overreaching teleological order, nor does it presuppose that specific purposes inhere in all pro- ception. "Proceptive direction concerns the potential course and outcome of what at any moment is the net integral effect of an indi- vidual's history" (i, 22). "To say that an individual necessarily has a proceptive direction means, then, that certain potentialities of doing, making, and saying, and certain potential relations to other things, are excluded from his future while others are included in it, all by virtue of the cumulative power of his past in total relation to the world" (II, 114). Anything, or more technically, any natural complex which is pres- ent to an individual-which actually modifies or reinforces his pro- ceptive direction-is part of his proceptive domain. And anything discriminated within a proceptive domain is a procept. Not every fact related to an individual is a procept (although it is a natural complex), for it may not be related to him as a proceiver. When we speak of an individual proceiving, we are using the verb intransi- tively, for the individual proceives nothing less than his world; his world is not something independent of the process of proception, it is the individual's proceptive domain. We can actually distinguish three "worlds": "the world that includes both complexes related to and complexes unrelated to a given individual; the world that in- cludes only the complexes related to him; and the world that includes only the complexes related to him uniquely" (ii, 120). Although theo- retically the first world might be identical with the second world and both are proceivable, the three worlds are concentrically related to one another. The first world is the entire actual and possible world: past, present and future; the second is the world without which an individual would not be; the third is the world without which an individual would not be the individual that he is. Restricting ourselves to the proceptive domain, we can distinguish three perspectives. There is the gross domain, which comprises every- thing that belongs to the individual's make-up; the floating domain,</page><page sequence="4">754 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY which "represents the summed up self or proceiver within a given situation," and the imminent domain, which comprises all that is present to or available to the proceiver at a given moment. Once again, these three domains are concentrically related to one another. When we add that the gross domain is a segment of the totality of natural complexes (the first world) we begin to see how Buchler lo- cates the human individual. But now we can ask the point of introducing this category of pro- ception with its accompanying terminology and distinctions. We have already briefly indicated Buchler's own justification for his gen- eral procedure (see footnote 1). But even if we are convinced of the necessity or desirability of introducing new categories, we want to know the purpose of introducing this specific category. One answer is that Buchler shares with Whitehead the conviction that the mean- ing and justification of a category cannot be fully explicated and warranted in a few key definitions or propositions, but only by fol- lowing how it is used with other categories in providing a compre- hensive, coherent, adequate scheme for understanding and exhibiting the essential traits of man in the world. But there is another way in which we can determine the signifi- cance of the category of proception: by comparing it with closely related philosophic concepts. From what we have said thus far, it would seem that what Buchler calls "proception" is very close to what Dewey called "experience," especially when Dewey character- ized experience as an organic interaction or transaction. Buchler is not only aware of the resemblance; he discusses it in order to clarify the distinguishing features of proception. Like Dewey, Buchler is critical of the dualistic and dichotomizing tendency that has influ- enced so much modern thought, whether it takes the form of opposing subject and object, mental and physical, private and public, or indi- vidual and social. Not that these distinctions are intrinsically mis- leading or useless; but they lend themselves to abuse when philoso- phers reify them and divide the world into epistemological or onto- logical dualisms. The roles that these distinctions play are functional when used to discriminate aspects or phases of proception. Like Dewey, Buchler is reacting against, and critical of, the Cartesian framework of modern philosophy with its search for ultimate epis- temological or ontological foundations and its excessive preoccupa- tion with man primarily as knower and spectator. The adumbration of the category of proception can be viewed as a search for a more general perspective within which traditional distinctions are given their just due.</page><page sequence="5">BUCHLER S METAPHYSICS 755 But although Dewey (and Peirce) persistently attacked and ex- posed the varieties of claims to immediate knowledge, Buchler thinks that they are tainted by the very tradition they were attacking, at least insofar as they attached special significance to "felt immediacy" or "immediate experience." "The theory of proception requires a very different approach to the issue of 'closeness' than does the pseu- dospatial notion of immediate experience" (i, 24). The distinction between the immediate and the mediate is a "treacherous and de- ceptive one" because it suggests that "the world unjudged or merely felt and the world judged or interpreted are of disparate ontological status" (I, 25). But nothing more nor less is "given" to the proceiver than the totality of his proceptive domain. Even when we distinguish the perspective of the "imminent domain," we are not isolating a domain that has a special "closeness" to the proceiver; it is a "slice" of the total or gross domain. Furthermore, Buchler claims that the category of proception en- ables us to purify another vestige of the epistemological traU`tion that persists in Dewey's concept of experience. While Dewey showed us how much more there is to human experience than is found in the emasculated concept of experience of the modern epistemological tradition, Dewey "persisted in regarding 'thought' or 'reflection' as the fullest and most genuine mnanifestation of 'experience' " (II, 103). But an experience, or more generally, any instance of proception, is neither more nor less complete, real, or genuine than any other in- stance. Intelligence does bring a certain moral power to experience, but intelligence is not a condition for the maximum being of the process. Buchler is here employing a principle that is fundamental for his entire metaphysical approach, one which is used in the first three books, but specified in detail only in his systematic investiga- tion of natural complexes. It is the "principle of ontological parity," and he contrasts it with "a principle of ontological priority-which has flourished from Parmenides to Whitehead and Heidegger, and which continues to flourish in unsuspected ways" (Iv, 30). According to the latter principle, some aspect or segment of reality, experience, or nature is singled out as being "more real," "more genuine," or "more authentic" than some other. But according to the principle of ontological parity, "whatever is discriminated in any way (whether it is 'encountered' or produced or otherwise related to) is a natural complex, and no complex is more 'real,' more 'natural,' more 'gen- uine,' or more 'ultimate,' than any other" (Iv, 31). Individuals, uni- versals, fictions, anything at all that can be discriminated are just what they are and do not have any more or less reality than anything</page><page sequence="6">756 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY else. Consequently, since proception is a natural complex, no type or instance of proception has any more or less reality than any other. One might think that this principle is innocuous, but it has impor- tant consequences for the theory of proception as well as for Buchler's entire metaphysical program. One of the driving thrusts of Buchler's exploration is to unmask the priorities that philosophers have as- signed to types of experiences and natural complexes, and to exhibit basic similarities without smuggling in moral, epistemological, or ontological priorities. While the category of proception encompasses the "truth" ingredient in the theory of experience developed in the American naturalistic tradition, it avoids the eulogistic connotations of "experience." By introducing a new term, Buchler hopes to em- phasize its neutrality and the ontological parity of all instances of proception. As we shall see, the principle also operates eminently in Buchler's theory of judgment; for all saying, doing, and making is judging-each of these modes of judging is just as fundamental and irreducible as the others. JUDGMENT Whereas the introduction of the category of proception illustrates the way in which Buchler uses a new term in order to avoid mislead- ing associations of closely related concepts, the use that Buchler makes of 'judgment' shows how a traditional concept is assigned a more general meaning. Proception as a process issues in products. Although we ordinarily think of producing as an intermittent activ- ity, there is, according to Buchler, a more fundamental sense in which we are always and continuously producing. As long as we are alive, we are always saying, doing, or making. Anything that is the result of saying, doing, or making (even if the result is not intended) is a product. A product actualizes a relation between an individual (pro- ceiver) and natural complexes. And Buchler classifies all products of proception as judgments or utterances. Assertion, then, is only one species of judgment. A dance, a moral act, a work of art, anything at all that is the result of the manipulative dimension of proceiving is a judgment. This does not simply mean that whatever we do or make involves or presupposes judgments; the products are judgments, and the processes by which these results are achieved are modes of judg- ing. But what does Buchler mean by judgment, and what is the point of extending this concept to cover all products of the individual? Every judgment is a pronouncement on some phase of the indi- vidual's world. To pronounce is to apply an attitude or to bring a natural complex within the range of an attitude or perspective. "We bring things into relation to us, we render them more determinate</page><page sequence="7">BUCHLER S METAPHYSICS 757 in a given respect, by doing something to them, or by making some- thing out of them, or by saying something about them" (II, 13). All saying, doing, making involves selectivity or discrimination, a selec- tivity that at once expresses and shapes what we are. At the same time that every act of judgment is a pronouncement, it is also an appraisal. In all proception, there is at least a tacit appraisal of some traits as relevant and some as irrelevant. Neither pronouncing nor appraising is solely or even primarily an intellectual function of the individual. The way or style in which we do and make things (even when we are not aware of what we are doing or making) is as much a pronounce- ment and appraisal of natural complexes as what we say. Collectively an individual's judgments mirror what he is, although a proceiver as a center of potentialities is always more than the actual judgments he produces. The claim that all products of proception are judgments may strike the reader as so wild that he may be perplexed why any philosopher would seriously defend it. Yet, I think we can appreciate Buchler's contention if we reflect upon the history of the phenomenological movement. For in this tradition, especially in Hegel himself, we can see a perspective developed in which man's products are not simply viewed as objects external to him, but as the direct expression, the objectification of what he is. Just as Hegel would maintain that an individual is and is not the totality of his objectifications (judgments), so Buchler claims that although the totality of an individual's judg- ments mirror the self, they do not exhaust the powers and potentiali- ties of the individual. Buchler humanizes and naturalizes this phe- nomenological insight, and he strips it of its intellectual pretensions. For, according to Buchler, although Hegel shows us that all human products can be understood as human judgments (although strictly speaking for Hegel they are objectifications of Geist), Hegel's para- digm of judgment is conscious assertion, whereas for Buchler asser- tion is only one species of judgment. Here too the principle of onto- logical parity is at work, for there is no ontological hierarchy of saying, doing, and making. Buchler classifies judgments according to the three modes of hu- man production: judgments are active, exhibitive, or assertive. These distinctions are functional rather than structural. Whether a product is interpreted as an assertion, exhibition, or action depends on the context in which it is uttered, not on any intrinsic properties of the utterance. Normally we use words to make assertions, but we can make assertions without using words when, for example, we make a significant gesture such as a nod of approval. Although a poem con-</page><page sequence="8">758 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY sists of words, its primary function may be to make an exhibitive judgment rather than to assert something. We might not normally think of our actions as making exhibitive judgments, but the total effect of a dance can be exhibitive. Although the distinction between active, exhibitive, and assertive judgments is not clear and distinct, and any particular utterance may function in all three ways, we can make a rough differentiation. As- sertive judgments include all those products where we can ask, is it true or false? (or apply related epistemic concepts such as "probable" or "necessary"). "Exhibitive judgments include all products which result from the shaping and arranging of materials.... Active judg- ments comprise all instances of conduct to which the term 'action' is ordinarily applied" (i, 48). Nor is it the case that only one variety of judgments-assertions-are cognitive or have meaning. Every judgment is open to interpretation and can communicate to another proceiver. Meaning is not restricted to assertions; we can legitimately ask for the meaning of active and exhibitive judgments. Furthermore, a judgment is not a discrete event independent and separable from everything else. Every judgment reflects something more than itself "by virtue of which it is the judgment that it is and has the meaning or communicative effect that it has" (i, 113). Every judgment is uttered within a larger framework, point of view, or perspective. The properties attributed to a judgment belong to it by virtue of some perspective. A system of mathematics, a social code, an artistic style may all serve as perspectives within which individual judgments are uttered. Perspectives can be shared by different pro- ceivers (although not all perspectives are sharable), and it is because perspectives are sharable that there can be communication by the various types of judgment. Not only can perspectives be shared; they can be adopted, modified, or abandoned. And a particular utterance can function within different perspectives. However, as human pro- ceivers we never escape from making judgments within some perspec- tive, no matter how precise or vague it may be. We can now understand how these reflections on the nature of judgment dovetail with the analysis of proception. Buchler joins many contemporary thinkers in criticizing the philosophic distortion of man as primarily a knower or sayer. We are still feeling the effects today of the philosophic rebellion against this view of man. But when philosophers rebel, there is a tendency to move to dialectical extremes. The result has been a variety of "philosophies of action" and "phi- losophies of immediacy" which have proliferated in reaction to more traditional "philosophies of knowledge." All of these philosophies,</page><page sequence="9">BUCHLER S METAPHYSICS 759 with their special emphases, are guilty of the same mistaken principle of ontological priority whereby one dimension of human existence is seized upon and assigned a special status. But whether we are act- ing, making, or doing we are engaged in distinctively human pro- cesses, and whereas, for specific purposes in specific contexts, one of these modes may be more important than the others, from the per- spective of a metaphysics of human utterance, all are equally basic and irreducible. Furthermore, as judgments, all three modes share generic features. Perhaps the most interesting consequence of Buchler's theory of judgment is its significance for understanding the nature of philoso- phy (and especially Buchler's own). Philosophy uses both assertive and exhibitive judgments, and as an activity it is a form of active judgment. To appreciate the nature of philosophy we must under- stand all three of its functions. Philosophy shares features with both science and art. Like art, it constructs, it shapes by bringing "together a number of categories and developing them by analogy and metaphor and definition" (i, 122). But while philosophy has an important exhibitive function, it is not a "free creation." Philosophy constructs and is at the same time a commentary on its construction: "it examines alternatives, excludes supposed implications, and justifies the categorial configurations in terms that do not make use of the categories" (i, 122). However, we must not think of philosophy as consisting of two parts, but rather as a single judgment-complex. Philosophy both says and shows; it asserts and exhibits. This emphasis on the mutual reinforcement of assertion and exhibition provides an orientation for understanding what Buchler himself is doing. His investigations do not take a di- rect argumentative form in which key premises are made explicit and inferences drawn from them. By the use of metaphor, analogy, defi- nition, comparison, commentary, and argument, he weaves an elab- orate tapestry of interconnecting categories which is intended as a general interpretive scheme for revealing basic similarities and dif- ferences among natural complexes. Buchler's emphasis on the ex- hibitive or "showing" function of philosophy has direct consequences for the evaluation of a philosophic perspective. Such a perspective is developed as one which is to be shared and criticized, which is offered to compel assent. This assent is not simply a matter of accepting as- sertions as true; indeed "the minimal requirement of achievement in philosophy is that it compel imaginative assent and arouse the sense of encompassment even where it fails of cognitive acceptance" (i, 134). While philosophy consists of the interplay of assertive and ex-</page><page sequence="10">760 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY hibitive judgments, as a form of query-"the interrogative spirit methodically directed"-it is an activity. Art, science, and philosophy are (at least) protracted action, and they each subdivide into habits and techniques of action. Action as such, it is commonly believed, does not question; it simply occurs and exists. But this is an error. We question as much by our actions as by our words.... What we do in a given situation may challenge the stability or value of our present situation, suspend an aspiration, create a pair of alternatives for someone else, impose demands and conditions-and in general, by active commentary on present existence, complicate the future course of utterance in any mode. We are never, to be sure, actors purely and simply; but then, neither are we ever discoursers or contrivers purely and simply (ii, 63). Philosophy is composed of assertive, exhibitive, and active judg- ments; each of these three modes is equally integral to philosophy. The exhibitive and active functions of philosophy are not secondary or accidental features. An important distinction has been lurking in our discussion. Ac- cording to Buchler, any product of a proceiver is a judgment, whether it is the result of design or purpose or is an "accidental" by-product. Throwing a piece of paper in a waste basket is no more or less a judgment than designing a complicated experiment. Idly doodling is a judgment, as is the creation of a masterpiece. Uttering nonsense syllables is a judgment, just as much as working out an elegant mathematical proof. All these instances of production are instances of judgment, but some are pursued methodically while others are not. We must be careful here, for many types of activity, whether doodling, uttering nonsense syllables, or throwing away scraps of paper, can be performed methodically. But to advance our understanding of the metaphysics of utterance, we must explore the concept of method and its correlative concept, query. METHOD The best succinct statement of what Buchler means by 'methodic' and 'query' is given in a footnote to Metaphysics of Natural Com- plexes: Methodic activity is the purposive ramification of judgment in any of its modes-assertive, active, exhibitive. When methodic activity is in- formed by the interrogative spirit, by invention and probing, it consti- tutes query. Query is the genus of which inquiry or science is one species -the species concerned with the ramification and validation of assertive judgments (iv, 187). Just as the concept of judgment is generalized to encompass doing</page><page sequence="11">BUCHLER'S METAPHYSICS 76I and making, so also are the corresponding concepts of method and query. But it is easy to miss the point of what Buchler is claiming. He is not claiming that inquiry (which is concerned with the rami- fication and validation of assertive judgments) is necessarily involved in all doing and making, but rather that there are forms of method and query distinctively appropriate to our doing and making. When an artist selects and arranges his material, he can do this purposively and thereby ramify his exhibitive judgments. The process of artistic creation can be informed by probing and invention, so that it be- comes a form of query. So too with our active judgments. A good me- chanic will tinker with an engine methodically in order to locate a source of trouble; his activity is methodical and is informed by the "interrogative spirit." "A method is a power of manipulating natural complexes, pur- posively and recognizably, within a reproducible order of utterances: and methodic activity is the translation of such a power into the pursuit of an end-an end implied by the reproduction" (III, 135). Method does not simply arise from need, it arises as much from "zest and even prodigality." Men deliberately attempt to limit their world in some respects and to make it more abundant in others; method arises from the basic ability to control and direct the world within which the proceiver finds himself. Thus the basic concept for under- standing method is that of power, for method is a human power. Echoing the Lockean notion of power, which he seeks to revive as a legitimate and essential philosophic concept, Buchler tells us that "a power may be described as a possibility that has been realized at least once and that can be recognized as generic in the next instance of its realization" (iii, 100). This concept of method as a power has close affinities with Peirce's concept of thirdness, especially when Peirce emphasizes that although a third is manifested in particular and discrete acts, a third is never exhausted in any of its manifesta- tions. Method as a power cannot be reduced to a prior body of rules or instruments, for these "do not motivate and direct themselves" (iii, 100). And although method is a human power, it does not reside solely in agents, "but in a natural complex that embraces agents and other component complexes" (iii, 101). Although method is essentially purposive, the goal to be achieved can have almost any degree of specificity or indefiniteness. We must be careful not to smuggle in any eulogistic or moralistic overtones in this general account of method, for the varieties of method are indefinite: There can be methods for suppressing knowledge as well as methods for achieving knowledge, methods for destroying life as</page><page sequence="12">762 THE JOURNAL OF PHIILOSOPHY well as for saving it, methods for stifling creativity as well as methods for fostering it. Furthermore, methods can be routine, habitual, and arbitrary. If I select a group of people from a class by picking all those whose last names begin with 'B', I am performing a methodic activity, but there is nothing inventive or novel about it. Method becomes inventive only when it becomes query. In query there is indefinitely continuing ramification. "The primary effort of method is repeatedly to complete its instances; of query, to deepen each instance. Method without query can destroy mankind and its own laborious progenly. Method informed by query is the essential expression of reason. Rea- son is query aiming to grow and flourish forever" (III, 114). If we take this last suggestion seriously, as Buchler certainly wants us to take it, then a life of reason can be expressed in what we do and make as well as in what we say. Once again, the dominant thrust of Buchler's philosophy is evident. Throughout the exploration of the concepts of judgment, method, and query, he has attempted to show the relevance of these concepts to our saying, doing, making. And he has challenged any claim to assign one of these modes of judgment greater significance than the other two. Man as a unitary rational being can live a life of reason by cultivating query in all its modes. Buchler's first three books develop a comprehensive picture of man as an individual and in community. He presents us with a judgment- complex which is both assertive and exhibitive, one which builds upon and modifies the naturalistic tradition in American thought as exemplified in Peirce, James, Santayana, Mead, Dewey, and White- head. Man as a proceiver is understood as a creature who is continu- ously assimilating and manipulating. He interacts with the world as doer, sayer, and maker. Buchler emphasizes over and over again that these three modes of producing are equally basic for a metaphysical understanding of man. And he attempts to elaborate a categorial scheme that both captures and underscores this essential understand- ing. In classifying all human products as judgments, Buchler wants to show that in everything man produces he is making a pronounce- ment and assessment of natural complexes whereby the human self is expressed and shaped. We are what we do, say, and make. At the same time, he seeks to restore the applicability of the concept of human power which is never exhausted in any set of actual judg- ments. Furthermore, when man becomes self-conscious of his capacity to manipulate, he can act methodically and, consequently, purpos- ively ramify his judgments. He can do this with imagination and invention; he can inform his producing with the "interrogative</page><page sequence="13">BUCHLER S METAPHYSICS 763 spirit." And the new perspective that emerges enables us to assign a new meaning to man as a rational creature. In a spirit reminiscent of the Platonic conception of eros, Buchler tells us that "reason is a form of love.... It is love of inventive communication. Nothing is more foundational for all value than query, and reason is devotion to query" (I, 168). NATURAL COMPLEXES If Buchler had ended his inquiry after his first three books, his project of sketching a comprehensive metaphysical scheme would have been radically incomplete. The dominant emphasis in these three books is on the human individual, his role in community and his interactions in the world. Yet in the opening pages of Buchler's first book, in the definition of proception, Buchler introduces the concept of natural complexes. Although this concept plays an im- portant role in his first three studies, it is only in his most recent book that Buchler turns his attention to an explicit analysis. The movement of his speculation is from a metaphysics of human utter- ance or judgment to a more general metaphysics of natural com- plexes: the analysis he offers here is at once more general, more abstract, and more argumentative than that found in the preceding books. Whatever is, in whatever way, is a natural complex.... Relations, struc- tures, processes, societies, human individuals, human products, physical bodies, words and bodies of discourse, ideas, qualities, contradictions, meanings, reasonings, dream-all are natural complexes. All of these terms bespeak discriminations of some kind, and whatever is discrim- inated in any respect or in any degree is a natural complex. (for short "complex") (iv, 1). 'Natural complex' is Buchler's most general and abstract metaphysi- cal category; it designates everything that is, in whatever way. And this includes not just actualities, but possibilities, and even contra- dictions. In defending the employment of this new category, Buchler argues that none of the competing traditional terms, such as 'exis- tence', 'being', 'reality', 'entity', have the scope and integrity of the generic term, 'natural complex'. What then are the characteristics of "natural complexes"? Every- thing that is or can be discriminated (we do not know if all natural complexes are humanly discriminable) is a complex. There are no basic, pure, atomic simples. Every natural complex is related to other complexes and is located in some order; it affects and is affected by other complexes. This is not a doctrine of internal relations. For although every natural complex is related to other natural complexes,</page><page sequence="14">764 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY it does not follow that every natural complex is related to every other natural complex. The contrast of "simples" and "complexes" can have a use within some perspective or order, but the notion of ab- solute ontological simples is a myth paralleled by the epistemological myth of the pure given. This entails that every natural complex has subaltern complexes and is subaltern to some other complexes. And although these subaltern complexes or "traits" are further discrim- inations within a complex, Buchler rejects traditional notions for understanding this relation of complexes and subaltern complexes. They are not "contained" as a box contains things or as a substance has attributes or as a cluster consists of discrete traits. As Buchler himself notes, his formulations can be viewed as a "generalization and neutralization of the maxim of Anaxagoras, 'Neither is there a least of what is small, but there is always a less... But there is always a greater than what is great' " (Iv, 14). There are two important consequences of this theory of natural complexes. First, it is a doctrine of pluralism and openness. Every- thing is a natural complex; there is no single "stuff" to which these can all be reduced. Natural complexes are in different irreducible orders. Secondly, this metaphysical doctrine is closely related to Buchler's conception of query. For although a particular query has beginning points and terminal points, there are no absolute begin- nings or endings of query in any of its modes. There are no ultimate foundations, and no ultimate terminus to query. Such notions as complete description, explanation, or analysis turn out to be vacu- ous. At best there can be completeness of query only within a limited and well-defined order or perspective. This conviction about the essential inexhaustibleness of complexes and query (which is also a natural complex) has self-referential consequences for Buchler's own philosophic method. For his investigations constantly exhibit the sense of man in medias res involved in a configuration of natural complexes. The use of the term 'natural' in 'natural complex' is more difficult to pin down. We are told that 'natural' is not set up to be contrasted with 'nonnatural', or 'supernatural', but it is not entirely clear what the positive meaning of 'natural' is in this context. 'Natural complex' is used to designate "all discriminanda generically" (Iv, 2). Conse- quently, even the concept of God, if it is thought of as a metaphysi- cally viable concept, signifies a natural complex. The proper question about anything that we discriminate is not whether it is or is not a natural complex, but rather what kind of complex it is, what are its generic and specific features.</page><page sequence="15">BUCHLER 'S METAPHYSICS 765 Every natural complex has integrity, scope, and contour. "Any com- plex has just the status, just the relations, just the constitution that it has" (Iv, 22). This is its integrity, and integrity entails both unique- ness and commonness. The scope of a complex has various forms, in- cluding comprehensiveness, pervasiveness, and inclusiveness. And the contour of a natural complex is "the continuity and totality of its locations, the interrelation of its integrities" (Iv, 22). Every natural complex is characterized by its prevalence and ales- cence. Buchler, more stridently than in his other books, argues that traditional metaphysical distinctions are inadequate for describing the generic features of natural complexes, and he boldly introduces a new and strange terminology. The minimal sense of claiming that every natural complex prevails is that every complex obtains, it has "an inviolability merely as such" (Iv, 53). Furthermore, in saying that every natural complex prevails "we are implying that it is in- eluctable; that it has a sphere of primacy and domination; that it is restrictive and exclusive of other complexes" (Iv, 53). Every natural complex is prevalent in some respect; it is also not prevalent in cer- tain respects and orders. Every complex then is not only prevalent; it is also alescent. This term is suggested by the Latin alescere and is introduced to suggest "coming about," or "taking place." Alescence can also take the form of deviation or variation. A complex "is preva- lent in so far as it excludes traits from its contour. A complex is ales- cent in so far as it admits traits into its contour." Although the ter- minology is new, we might think that Buchler is merely rebaptizing old distinctions. But he explicitly discusses a number of these dis- tinctions, including "permanence and change"; "being and becom- ing "; "regularity and irregularity"; "determinateness and indeter- minateness"; "the intelligible and the unintelligible" in order to show that none of these correspond to the distinction of "prevalence and alescence." The most interesting and forceful use of these highly abstract meta- physical concepts occurs in Buchler's discussion of possibility and actuality. For even if we are not completely satisfied with Buchler's positive doctrine, he raises challenging criticisms of many contem- porary and traditional accounts of possibility and actuality. It should be clear that both actualities and potentialities are natural com- plexes. Consequently, both possibilities and actualities exhibit preva- lence and alescence. As natural complexes they are necessarily related to other complexes; there are no "pure" possibilities, just as there are no "pure" actualities. Possibilities are always possibilities of and for natural complexes.</page><page sequence="16">766 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Just as actualities cannot be conceived apart from their relation to possibilities, so too possibilities cannot be conceived without re- lation to actualities. "A possibility cannot be said to prevail or to arise if it is unrelated to any actualities, nor can an actuality be said to prevail or arise if it is unrelated to any possibility" (iv, 133). Buchler attempts to show that many of the traditional ways of dis- tinguishing actualities from possibilities fail. Thus the contrast of the physical and the nonphysical won't do, for there are actualities like "aims, thoughts, or poems" (Iv, 143), which are not exclusively physical, but are actualities. Nor can we distinguish actualities by saying that "they come to pass," for "tonal relations, physical ra- tios, and space, which have not come to pass.. -are as actual as physical bodies and wars are" (Iv, 144). Nor is it the case that only actualities are encountered, for we encounter possibilities. "When our friend lies gravely ill, we encounter the possibility of death.... Possibilities may have an impact, even as actualities may, and it inay be a dull or vivid impact" (iv, 145). And it turns out that both possi- bilities and actualities can be efficacious. But then how are we to dis- tinguish them? Consider two contradictory traits. They are sometimes both found to prevail as possibilities in one and the same order of complexes. They are never both found to prevail as actualities in one and the same order. A given tree will possibly grow to 100 feet and possibly not grow to 100 feet. It will never actually grow to 100 feet and actually not grow to 100 feet. The principal consideration with respect to actuality is that if mutually contradictory complexes are actual, they never prevail in the same order; if mutually contradictory complexes prevail in the same order they are not actualities (iv, 156). The basis then for distinguishing actualities from possibilities pivots on the way in which each of these are exclusive and restrictive. Whereas all prevalences restrict and exclude, actualities do this in a different way than possibilities, for mutually contradictory actuali- ties cannot prevail in the same order, while "contradictory traits mlay prevail as possibilities in the sense that both are actualizable, both are eligible for actualization, given certain conditions that obtain" (iv, 157). Buchler's treatment of possibility and actuality illustrates a facet of his thought which we mentioned earlier. For throughout, he is attempting to break away from many of the biases and unquestioned presuppositions that have conditioned so much of the discussion of issues. There is a tendency, especially in contemporary philosophy, to think of possibilities on the model of discrete "entities" or "things"</page><page sequence="17">BUCHLER 'S METAPHYSICS 767 that are like discrete actual things, except that they don't exist. We then debate whether we are or are not to "countenance" such entities in our ontology. When the issue is formulated in this way, all kinds of queer questions arise concerning such possibilities. Where are they? Do they come into being? and pass away? Understandably, philoso- phers who think that the paradigm of a "real" entity is a concrete physical thing are loath to count such ethereal entities as part of their ontology. But, as Peirce remarked long ago, such a way of view- ing the issue reflects deeply ingrained nominalistic prejudices. For whether we decide to accept or not accept such "entities," we are thinking of them as sharp-edge, discrete "things." Buchler's point is that this approach is not only unsatisfactory for formulating is- sues concerning the nature of possibilities, it is unsatisfactory for understanding the characteristics of actualities as well. He is chal- lenging this entire "thing" framework and attempting to show us a more illuminating way of understanding the intimate interrelation- ships of actualities and possibilities, which escapes the strained dis- cussion of what kind of queer "entities" possibilities are. QUERIES Earlier we raised the question of the proper context for understand- ing and assessing Buchler's philosophy. I believe that we can now answer that question. For Buchler's metaphysics is best understood against the background of the American naturalistic tradition. Al- though his metaphysics echoes many of the themes developed by Peirce, James, Santayana, Dewey, and Whitehead, he is also sharply critical of these philosophers on specific points. Nevertheless, he shares the same metaphysical temper in his attempt to elaborate a comprehensive perspective for understanding nature and man as an integral part of nature. The pluralism, the essential inexhaustibility of nature, the anti-Cartesianism, the suspicion of any philosophic appeal to epistemological "givens" or ontological "simples," the on- going, self-corrective, and ramifying nature of query, the philosophic sensitivity to man as doer and maker as well as "knower" are incor- porated and explored in his metaphysics. Furthermore, many of the most lasting insights that have resulted from the more fashionable analytic and phenomenological movements are encompassed in his total perspective. Philosophers fascinated by new phenomenological investigations of experience frequently fall into the trap of thinking that the only alternatives to the phenomenological concept of ex- perience are those of traditional empiricists and rationalists. They fail to realize that there has been a persistent attempt, from Peirce to Buchler, to develop a more adequate theory of experience which</page><page sequence="18">768 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY shares many of the important characteristics of the phenomenologi- cal "field" and "world" and yet views experience as continuous with and encompassed by the rest of nature. Or consider some of the re- cent developments in analytic philosophy, such as the attack on the myth of the given, the expose of the foundation metaphor, the prob- ing critique of concepts of pure description and neutral observation. All of these themes have been developed by the "classical" American philosophers and have been explored by Buchler in novel ways. There is also an important point of contact with the recent emerg- ing "philosophy of mind." Negatively, much of the enthusiasm for this "new" field has developed from the increasing realization of the inadequacies of traditional empiricism and reductive behavioristic approaches. Positively, there has been increasing sensitivity to the distinctive nature of human activity and the change of philosophic perspective that takes place when we view man as an agent. Here too, one will find these themes developed by Buchler, especially in his appreciation of the manipulative dimension of proception and its consequences for man as doer and maker. But although these re- marks may help to clarify the context for appreciating Buchler's metaphysical investigations, there remains the complex task of as- sessing Buchler's distinctive contribution. First there are internal questions to be raised. Despite Buchler's attempt to develop a comprehensive interpretative scheme, it is dis- turbing to realize how many basic issues still remain to be confronted. Fundamental to Buchler's thought is the claim that human agents are causally efficacious, but there is no sustained and detailed analysis of the meaning and role of causation (although there is an illuminat- ing discussion of the closely related concepts of power and potential- ity). And I doubt if Buchler's brief discussion of God will satisfy the most sympathetic reader. We may well agree that "the critical ques- tion must be, not whether God exists, nor whether there is an 'entity' which satisfies the scheme of traits by which the concept of God is perpetuated, but in what way a natural complex thus discriminated is to be understood, analyzed, and experientially encompassed; or, in what way it is to be further discriminated and found related" (iv, 8). But if this is the critical question, the answer is not to be found in Buchler's four books. Again, one finds a detailed discussion of ac- tuality and possibility, but the concept of necessity is barely discussed. Or, consider the long metaphysical tradition of disputes about nom- inalism and realism. Here Buchler incisively comments on the con- fusions that have pervaded the discussion. And he carefully notes the misleading analogies that obscure our understanding of "traits or</page><page sequence="19">BUCHLER S METAPHYSICS 769 subaltern complexes" as "constituents" of a complex. But if we try to pin down the precise sense (senses) in which a trait is a constitu- ent of a complex, the concept turns out to be elusive. Further, al- though Buchler is skeptical of the Whiteheadian view that "every actual entity [or individual] is present in every other actual entity" and claims that we must avoid the two extreme positions: "that of anthropomorphism, by limiting 'experience' to human individuals; and that of the doctrine of internal relations, by not merely admitting degrees of relevance ... but so couching the conception of experience as to recognize a meaning for irrelevance" (ii, 106), the precise meta- physical relations between human individuals and other individuals -the toughest problem for any viable naturalism-is not precisely specified. Perhaps these and related issues will be explored in greater detail in future studies, but they suggest "external" questions about the verification or validation of Buchler's metaphysical scheme. In the preface to his first book (of this series), Buchler boldly stated the goal of a philosophic theory and the conditions for its acceptability: Every theory aims, in the last analysis, to exhibit a structure among data ordinarily regarded as disparate: by the use of a relatively small number of categories a scheme is devised which requires to be self-consistent and consistent with other schemes that have come to be thought part of the fabric of knowledge. The burden a philosophic theory in particular bears is likely to be great; for beyond these primal requirements it dedi- cates itself to the difficult union of a high level of generality with inter- pretative justice. In the case of such a theory the circumstances of veri- fication are usually very complex, and the acceptability of the result depends ultimately, perhaps, upon the presence of a sense of philosophic satisfaction in the reader, who is both spectator and participant (I, i; italics added). It would be a radical perversion of these claims to think that Buchler is saying that ultimately the acceptability of a philosophic scheme is merely a matter of taste. For the philosopher, like any individual, is not entitled to whatever he utters. "He must substantiate; he must validate or render secure the products that emanate from his own per- spectives" (i, 160). And such validation requires constant critical query. But it is just here that this reader remains unsatisfied. This is not to deny (as I have tried to show) that Buchler's investigations are rich in insight, challenges, new perspectives, and forceful argu- ments. But at times the level of analysis is so abstract and so con- densed that there is no sense of compulsion for accepting just this categorial scheme. In part, this is because Buchler has tried to cover</page><page sequence="20">77 0 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY so much ground in what is, comparatively speaking, a very short space. And, in part, this is perhaps the consequence of attempting to delineate new categories and stretch the meaning of familiar con- cepts. But the gap between the familiar and the unfamiliar is fre- quently too great to warrant philosophic satisfaction. Buchler is most forceful when he descends to more familiar philosophic prob- lems and distinctions and carefully tries to show us in detail what is muddled and inadequate about these, and then proceeds to show us why his analysis is superior. [Cf. his discussion of "basic judgments" (I, 81 ff.] But such a detailed critique of alternative philosophic doc- trines is all too rare. One hopes that, in future studies, Buchler will not only fill in the gaps in his categorial scheme, but will pursue the careful dialectical treatment of more familiar problems, solutions, and distinctions which will produce in the reader that philosophic compulsion which Buchler's total philosophic perspective demands.
