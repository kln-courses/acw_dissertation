<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BAROQUE IMAGINATION OF ROBBE-GRILLET Christine Brooke-Rose I "Certainement la Quêteuse étoit belle," wrote Furetière in the opening pages of Le Roman Bourgeois. . . N'attendez pas pourtant que je vous la décrive ici, comme on a coûtume de faire en ces occasions." Or again, earlier: . . je ne veux pas même vous dire comme est faite cette Eglise, quoi qu'assez célèbre: car ceu qui ne l'ont point vûe, la peuvent aller voir, si bon leur semble; ou la bâtir dans leur imagination comme il leur plaira."1 Thus in mid-classical dawn, one in the eye for the theory of art as imitation.2 It may seem a little perverse to open an essay on Robbe-Grillet the obsessive describer with a quotation from a seventeenth-century novelist who facetiously refuses to describe. But the connection is not so remote: Furetière made Sterne possible, and one aspect of Sterne contains the germ of the anti-novel, for Sterne in Tristram Shandy compared his book to Locke's Essay upon the Human Under standing, which he called "a history-book ... of what passes in a man's own mind",3 basing his construction not on plot but on memory and association, which enable him to be anywhere at any time. Rejection is always interesting. Even pre-Freudians, indeed, early rhetoricians, knew that protesting much could mean the opposite. And just as Chaucer's protestations that he knows nothing of rhetoric are in themselves rhetoric, in the best sense, presaging the use of particular skill, so when Robbe-Grillet tells us, repeatedly, 1 Furetière, Le Roman Bourgeois, 1666. 'Cf. Boileau, Art Poétique, Chant III, 11. 1-2, based on Aristotle, Poetics, IV; and René Bray, La formation de la doctrine classique en France, 1927 (reprinted 1951), chapter on Imitation, for discussion of this doctrine. • Tristram Shandy, Bk.

"mais cette scène ne mène à rien"6 or that what he has just described is "un entrecroisement de lignes sans signification,"7 we may assume the contrary. When Furetière refuses to describe his beautiful alms-collector, he manages to get a fairly detailed impression, if not of this woman, certainly of a woman, into the reasons he gives for refusing to describe. And he has preceded his remarks on the Eglise des Carmes with two pages about how other writers would have given it porches, balconies, columns and generally turned it into something as mag nificent as the Temple of Diana at Ephesus. This serves to produce in our minds the idea of a church, not of this church necessarily but of porches, balconies and columns, so that the refusal to describe, far from leaving us in an imageless vacuum, acts rather as a sudden pin-pointing from the general idea of a church to the particular, simpler and less grand church in question which, however, he need not describe. The technique is like making a ring on a map. Or like a framed and enlarged inset. Or like a type of camera close-up after a panoramic view. As a technique it contains a paradox in the very way of passing from general to particular: of all possible churches, it says, this is the one I mean; on the other hand it could be any church; it has no significance in its specific features, other than the fact that it is the one I mean; its selection by me is its whole significance. Occupatio or the refusal to describe is of course very old. In the vernacular we find it already in the twelfth century (e.g. in Cligés, by Chrestien de Troyes, 11. 2354 ff.). There, however, the device is comparatively simple. By the seventeenth century the whole paradox of antirhetoric as in itself rhetoric, anti-style as in itself a style, had burst out all over Europe into a vast and complex move ment broadly called Baroque—a term I shall not go into here since its use and subdivisions have occasioned more words from scholarly pens than almost any other term. It is interesting nevertheless that one recent study has defined the Baroque vision as having at its core "a systematic doubt in the validity of appearance, a doubt which expresses itself as an obsessive concern for appearance.

It is also interesting that apart from what is too often, and too loosely, called "imagery,"10 the most intrinsic quality of Baroque art, including poetry, is the new complex awareness it shows in its exploitation of time and space relations and in the elaborate precision with which these are established. Poetry, by a bizarre use of tenses and other means, produces slide-rule leaps in time together with a new effect of instantaneousness.11 Perhaps M. Gaétan Picon had these qualities in mind when he suggested of Robbe-Grillet's art: "Nous vivons peut-être le moment d'un préclassicisme."12 Now I have no intention of playing hunt-the-label or of proving that Robbe-Grillet is really a Baroque poet in disguise. Apart from the fact that he writes prose, he is best known, even by those who do not read him, as having abjured the one feature for which Baroque poetry is best known, even by those who do not read it, namely metaphor. I would like, however, to make two points about this. First, it is only the pathetic fallacy which Robbe-Grillet has abjured in metaphor, that is, the endowing of nature and inanimate objects with our human needs or emotions. Ruskin battled against it long ago, but it has obstinately survived, some might say rightly so, and even symbolism and the use of objective correlatives are strictly speaking a form of pathetic fallacy.

ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET 407</page><page sequence="4">operation is thus a recurrent and healthy one.13 However, he is by no means against metaphors or comparisons which liken object to object, or which bring a physical situation, as Aristotle would say, "before the eye in action"; e.g. when he calls the chequered red and white oilcloth in Dans le labyrinthe "le damier de petits carreaux rouges et blancs" (p. 40); and: "l'enfant . . . une tache noire" (p. 41), "le filament . . . enfermé dans sa cage de verre" (p. 16, bordering on the pathetic fallacy) or more originally, when he says of the boy's voice, which had broken the silence: "et la phrase, sans personne pour l'avoir prononcée, semblait être une légende au bas d'un dessin" (p. 147, a very Baroque idea). Admittedly these are infrequent, and presented, when unusual, as somebody's impression (semblait, on dirait); but they show that the author does not reject the analogical way of thinking as such. Indeed, analogy in its non-metaphoric sense is so intricately exploited it could be called a means of struc ture, as I hope to demonstrate. The second point is that metaphor in the best Baroque poetry is neither just decorative nor anthropomorphic but functional, one of the many means developed by those poets for the purpose of resolving the contradictory aspects of emotional experience in relation to the changing validities of time and the physical world. When Donne turns a flea into "our mariage bed, and mariage temple"14 or says to the sun "This bed thy center is, these walls, thy spheare," or of his lady-love "She' is all States, and all Princes, I,"15 he is shifting the perspective quite as suddenly as Robbe-Grillet does with a swift verbal close-up or a camera-swerve away from, say, the eyes of A, the "narrator's" wife in Jalousie, to the parapet of the terrace and then to the banana-segment in the distance.16 In Donne the shift is part of a complex argument, but the argument itself is a way out of an emotionally untenable position stated as an intellectual dilemma. Today, the process is necessarily much less overt, reflecting un conscious or semi-conscious fears, and Robbe-Grillet's unpronouned narrator averts his eyes from a visual image because it may, and u Even here he is not absolutely ruthless: there is the famous passage about the heart of the ice-cube in Jalousie, which, curiously enough, has received the most consistent praise from English critics. It is a dead metaphor in French, and Robbe-Grillet admitted to me when I pedantically taxed him with it that he was simply not vigilant enough. So in Dans le labyrinthe: neige vierge (51), surface . . . vierge (17), clarté maigre (32), le papier d'emballage . . . bâille (22). They in no way invalidate his position, but are the parallels to the rare lapses of grammar of which the author is guilty in his attempts at impersonal construction, e.g.: "Juste avant d'atteindre le but, un ordre bref a retenti . .

But the sudden swerve away, like the refusal to describe, has served to isolate the first image, to frame it. The words "frame" or "enlarged inset" which I have been using in relation to the world of emblematic art, is peculiarly apposite to Robbe-Grillet's technique. I am often reminded of documentary television, in which a small commentator stands beside a vast blow-up of a politician, a place, or other topic: there are two pictures really, the picture of the topic and the picture in the television-set. Robbe Grillet has himself declared that in a photograph or film, the angle, the black-and-whiteness, the two-dimensions, and above all the frame, give significance to any sight which in "reality" seems insignificant. I would add that the significance may be illusory (indeed, many film-directors rely too heavily on it) but that the significance given by the frame is the strongest, because it is the significance of selection, this combination of reality being framed rather than any other; and that it implies, like any picture, at least a minimal degree of composition. "L'homme 'baroque' construit en soi ou autour de soi un monde imaginaire," writes Professor Rousset, "dans lequel il s'installe comme en un monde plus réel, non sans garder par devers soi une certaine conscience de vivre en un mirage." Or again: "le Baroque se définit essentiellement par l'union du mouvement et du décor. . . And on mirrors and water: ". . . plaisir pris à douter, à se tromper sur des identités changeantes, qui se prolonge en un plaisir supérieur, celui de prendre la figure pour la réalité, l'apparence pour l'être, le théâtre pour la vie; ivresse toute proche de celle qu'on demandait alors aux voûtes peintes de Pierre de Cortone et du Père Pozzo, aux décors en trompe-l'oeuil, aux Sosies, à la pièce insérée dans la pièce."18 Robbe-Grillet himself makes a quite unprecedented use of pictures within pictures. One need only remember the framed engraving of the gardens in Marienbad, where the camera closed-up and either swerved off or seemed to go right through the engraving into the real gardens. Similarly the photograph of A in Jalousie always leads to A oh the terrace, the link being the café-table in the photograph and " See Bruce Morissette, "En relisant Robbe-Grillet," analysis of Jalousie in Critique, July 1959. I do not, however, agree with his use of the term "corrélation objective" for Robbe-drillet't "le support de ses [man's] passions." It seems too close to Eliot's objective correlative for comfort, and indeed may be a translation of it. u Anthologie de la poésie baroque française, vol. 1, Introduction, ed.

ALAIN ROBBE-GKILLET 409</page><page sequence="6">the coffee-table on the terrace, but with no change at all in the tone of the description. In Dans le labyrinthe the device has become extremely complex: the framed café-scene above the chest of drawers in the room is described to us, like all else, not by a narrator-partaker but (or so it seems) by a sort of God's eye who may or may not be the sudden "I" at the end o£ the novel. This final "I" is then clearly the doctor who looked after the dying soldier at the end, and possibly but not necessarily the "bourgeois" (with similar clothes and umbrella) who spoke to the soldier in the street and was earlier in the café, standing by the counter; moreover he is also by the counter in the picture of the café. As for the soldier, he is never described as himself seeing the picture, but each time the picture is described it comes to life as the real café, and the soldier is there; at other times the soldier looks into the café from outside, over the chin-level curtain on the glass of the door, as if looking at a picture, with three soldiers, each of whom looks like him. There is a similarly self-identifying complexity in the soldier's fantasies about the photo graph in the room of the ground-floor flat where he sits drinking wine after asking his way, and where he ends up in delirium: the soldier in the photograph, wearing a recruit's uniform, is the woman's husband, unheard of since a certain Battle of Reichenfels (from which this soldier has just returned). At one point he imagines the scene when the woman now speaking to him took this photograph, before the soldier's departure. The transition from this reconstruc tion to the reality of the room is achieved by a mere change of particle from sa femme to la femme (p. 69), almost imperceptibly because already at sa femme the description of the soldier going in again (after the taking of the photograph), into the dark corridor and into the flat could apply to this soldier also. By framing a soldier under a street-lamp in the sun at the beginning of a war, the author also reframes in our minds (since the soldier is indoors now) and in the perspective of contrast, the soldier we have got to know so well, under many street-lamps, in the snow and bitter cold, at the end of a war. Robbe-Grillet's technique, with its elaborate formalism, might well be said to give artistic significance, as the frame does, to what he has stated and continues throughout, both to imply and to state is in itself without significance. This is a paradox with which Beckett is also much concerned:19 a paradox, moreover, worthy of the best u Cp. Watt (Olympia Preas, Paris 1958), pp. 83-4: "Yes, Watt could not accept . . . that nothing had happened, with all the clarity and solidity of something . . "for the only way one can speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something. . . 410 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">Baroque imaginations. The next section will be an attempt to examine it by means of a detailed analysis of Dans le labyrinthe, in the light also of another and related paradox, namely that notwith standing the age-old distinction between formalism and realism, formalism is realism. By this I mean rather more than what Nathalie Sarraute seems to mean when she says20 that the so-called formalists, who try hard to look anew, and to evolve new forms for the expression of what they see, are the true realists; whereas the so-called realists are the formalists because they are essentially reporters, however acute, who look fairly hard but see what any other intelligent person look ing at that same area of experience would also see, and who are obliged for ready intelligibility and urgency of communication to pour what they have seen into the by then familiar forms evolved by the previous generation's formal experimenters (indeed, one might add that their very seeing is conditioned by those forms). I agree with this, just as I agree with Bruce Morissette21 that Robbe Grillet's every obsessive dwelling, every cut, swerve and merging by association re-create a psychological reality which is far more con vincing, for our time, than that re-created by analysis and other earlier means. I shall certainly take it for granted here that Robbe Grillet does create for us, so that we are experiencing it, not observ ing it, the psychological reality inside the lost soldier of Dans le labyrinthe. But I think he does more. For as Nathalie Sarraute has also said, "it is not the novelist's job merely to reproduce a likeness." Art does not, in other words, imitate nature and never has. Art is an act of love, and, like love it must, at its best, "imiter ce qu'il y a de plus violent en nous, mais selon les conventions de la civilisation."22 The distinction is perhaps a matter of degree, not of kind. But where form is as highly developed as in Robbe-Grillet, and as highly charged with passion, form is in itself a reality. II The first sentence of Dans le labyrinthe (p. 9) is ostensibly by an I-narrator: "Je suis seul ici, maintenant, bien à l'abri." We do not know who "je" is. The final nine-page section, after the soldier's 20 "Ce que voient les oiseaux," Nouvelle Nouvelle Revue Française, Jan. 1956.

ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET 411</page><page sequence="8">delirium dream, begins (p. 211): "A ma dernière visite, la troisième piqûre a été inutile. Le soldat blessé était mort." But even in these last nine pages, told (as we now know from that sentence) by the doctor, the pronoun is again avoided until the very last phrase, "et toute la ville derrière moi." Between the first sentence and "A ma dernière visite" the first person singular is not used except in dialogue. But unlike the pronoun-less husband-narrator in Jalousie, this pro noun-less narrator is in a sense two people at once, the (now with drawn) I-narrator possibly reconstructing afterwards, and the soldier, in the third person, whose sight, hearing, thought, confusion, hunger, fatigue and pain we are made to share as if we were he, although we are also frequently made to see him from the outside, or from a distance, and even from someone else's viewpoint (e.g. the boy's). The narrator is thus closer to the omniscient author of the old convention, without, of course, the butting in, but as we shall see he is not really the omniscient author, he is the soldier in a timeless vacuum, framed by the I-narrator and constantly counter pointed by an implied outside observer who could be the I-narrator or the soldier himself. After "Je suis seul ici . . (p. 9) the second sentence is: "Dehors il pleut, dehors on marche sous la pluie en courbant la tête, s'abritant les yeux d'une main tout en regardant quand même devant soi, à quelques mètres devant soi, quelques mètres d'asphalte mouillé." In the next sentence it is cold, and there is wind in the leaves that moves the shade of branches on the white walls, and by the end of the paragraph time has again changed to: "Dehors il y a du soleil, il n'y a pas un arbre, ni un arbuste, pour donner de l'ombre, et l'on marche en plein soleil, s'abritant les yeux d'une main tout en regardant devant soi, à quelques mètres seulement devant soi, quelques mètres d'asphalte poussiéreux où le vent dessine des parallèles, des fourches, des spirales" (p. 9). This opening paragraph epitomizes the mood of the whole novel, as it were out of time. It is like an opening theme in a symphony, closely related to the main theme but not in itself the main theme. For of course the action of the book is in bitter snow, and the recurrent phrase soon becomes "Dehors il neige." People, as well as the soldier, do walk at various times with their hand up to protect their eyes, but from the snow blizzards, not from the rain or sun, nor is the street later either wet or dusty but a clean or a trampled white. Not till the very end, when the first person comes in again, do we get the phrase "Dehors il pleut." Yet the present tense is used throughout the first paragraph (and throughout the 412 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">book except in a few flashbacks, made fairly unambiguous as flash backs by the use of the imperfect). This instantaneousness is at a different moment from the instantaneousness to come. The place, a small town, is the same, though the streets may or may not be the same throughout. But the time in terms of the weather, though described particularly, is here made general by the triple change. The particularisation into winter, and all further spatial and tem poral developments, are yet to come. At the end of this first paragraph, however, a subsidiary theme is stated: "le vent dessine des parallèles, des fourches, des spirales." This is by no means as subsidiary as it looks, for it is to receive a very full treatment, as full as that of the snow, though less im mediately obvious because part of it; yet the snowscape would be nothing without it. Furthermore, it is also given its balancing inde pendent importance, beyond the reach of the snow, indoors, where we are at once taken: "Ici le soleil n'entre pas, ni le vent, ni la pluie, ni la poussière" (p. 9). We are still, then, with the I-narrator who can see or conceive the street in its various seasonal aspects, but he is indoors. From then on, however, we may or may not be still with him as objectivity takes over. The dust, in that list, at once becomes a less negative link than the wind, rain or sun which do not enter, for there is after all dust inside, a fine dust on all horizontal surfaces, on the varnished table, on the polished floorboards, on the veined marble of the chest of drapers, but this dust comes from the room itself, not from the street. And in this dust patterns occur, the round or square or rectangular traces of objects there but since displaced, identifiable by the shape left behind, notably that of a round glass ash-tray. This roundness links with the circle of light projected by the lamp onto the ceiling, but the circle is imperfect, cut by one of the walls which, unlike the other three, is covered from top to bottom and over most of its width by heavy red curtains. The curtains lead back to what is beyond them. "Dehors il neige. Le vent chasse sur l'asphalte sombre du trottoir les fins cristaux secs, qui se déposent après chaque rafale en lignes blanches, parallèles, fourches, spirales . . . recomposant de nouvelles spirales, volutes, ondulations fourchues, arabesques mouvantes aussitôt disloquées . . (p. 11). So the in/out play of shapes begins, like an abstract painting in motion, except that the links are occasionally non-visual:23 here the " More rarely, though, than In Jalousie. ALAIN RQBBE-GRILLKT 413</page><page sequence="10">noise of heels on the pavement acts as the next link, again negatively, for it is then said that they cannot be heard inside: "La rue est trop longue, les rideaux trop épais, la maison trop haute."24 We are back indoors. On the polished floor felt slippers have traced shining paths from the bed to the chest of drawers, from the chest of drawers to the chimney-piece, from the chimney to the table. A sort of cross, or knife, or dagger, lies to the right. . . . On the edge of the lamp a small fly walks, projecting a deformed shadow on the ceiling. . . . "Dehors il neige. Dehors il a neigé, il neigeait, dehors il neige" (p. 14). With this sudden mixture of tenses the first theme, which amounts to 'we are watching this out of time,' recurs briefly, but plunges us straight back into instantaneousness. Time, however, has already passed: "Les flocons serrés descendent doucement, dans une chute uniforme, ininterrompue, verticale—car il n'y a pas un souffle d'air— devant les hautes façades grises . . (pp. 14-15). Before, the wind was blowing the snow in twists and spirals over a still dark pave ment; heels could be heard. Now the snow is vertical, there is no breath of wind. Imperceptibly the visual pattern of shapes becomes a pattern of time as the shapes take us indoors and out by a process built on analogy. But already the anti-rhetoric warns us off. After a description of the rectilinear street and the cross-roads and the converted gas lamp on the corner, lit though in full daylight (the street-lamp echoing the indoor lamp) we are told: "Mais c'est un jour sans éclat, qui rend toutes choses plates et ternes. Au lieu des perspectives spectaculaires auxquelles ces enfilades de maisons devraient donner naissance, il n'y a qu'un entrecroisement de lignes sans signification . . (p. 15). These very lines, however, lead us back to the room: "A la limite du mur et du plafond, l'ombre de la mouche, image grossie du fila ment de l'ampoule électrique . . (p. 15). Then, quietly, the next paragraph begins: "C'est encore le même filament, celui d'une lampe identique ou à peine plus grosse, qui brille pour rien au carrefour des deux rues, enfermé dans sa cage de verre en haut d'un pied de fonte, ancien bec de gaz aux ornements démodés devenu lampadaire électrique" (p. 16). After which comes the first description of the soldier standing in the circle of light, in the snow. One naturally remembers the fly on the ceiling. « P. 12. The height of the house, so casually mentioned here, is important. See my comments pp. 416-417, 419. 414 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">The parallelism is clear, and carried out with an almost mathe matical consistency, the linguistic transition being either a definite yet ambiguously used expression of similarity like même, un autre, aussi, un motif analogue etc., or more often, mere contiguity, the next scene being described without any linguistic indication that it is not the same scene. For example, the portrait of the soldier is a detailed close-up of both the ornate lamp-base and the man leaning against it—tired, cold and grey-looking with a one-day old béard. The pavement is now white without traces and snow has accumulated a little on the lower edge of the lamp base: Mais le bas de la capote a balayé quelques-uns de ces menus amas, de même que les chaussures, en changeant plusieurs fois de position, ont tassé la neige dans leurs alentours immédiats, laissant par endroit des taches plus jaunes, des morceaux durcis à demi soulevés, et les marques profondes des têtes de clous rangées en quinconces. Devant la commode, les chaussons de feutre ont dessiné dans la poussière une large zone brillante. ... De l'une à l'autre est tracé un étroit chemin de parquet luisant; un second chemin va de la table jusqu'au lit. Parallèlement au mur des maisons, ... un chemin rectiligne marque aussi le trottoir enneigé. D'un gris jaunâtre, produit par le piétinement de personnages maintenant disparus, il passe entre le lampadaire allumé et la porte du dernier immeuble, puis tourne à angle droit et s'éloigne dans la rue perpendiculaire, toujours longeant le pied des façades, au tiers envivon de la largeur du trottoir, d'un bout à l'autre de sa longueur. Un autre chemin repart, ensuite, du lit vers la commode. ... (p. 18) During this very description, in and out of doors, time has passed again, for the virgin pavement is now marked by a yellow path "produit par le piétinement de personnages maintenant disparus," echoing the traces left in the dust by objects displaced in the room (p. 10). The visual counter-pointing continues, from the pat terns in the dust to the dagger-like cross, to the striped wall-paper with its dagger-handle-or-flame-or-clove motif ("un motif analogue orne encore le papier peint des murs" [p. 19], encore suggesting either that the I-narrator is seeing this much later or that the paper is old at the time, or both); and from the flame motif to the lamp, to the fly and back again to the soldier under the lamp, this time with the famous oblong box under his arm: Dehors, le ciel est toujours de la même blancheur sans éclat. Il fait jour encore. La rue est deserte: ni voitures sur la chaussée, ni piétons sur les trottoirs. Il a neigé; et la neige n'a pas encore fondu. ... La platitude de tout ce décor ferait croire, d'ailleurs, qu'il n'y a rien derrière ces carreaux, derrière ces portes, derrière ces façades. Et toute la scène demeure vide; sans un homme, ni une femme, ni même un enfant." (pp. 23-4) ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET 415</page><page sequence="12">The first statement of theme is now over. We are given a sudden camera-swerve back to the interior. But the purpose now is to lead us to another interior, that of the café. Consequently the switch is not by visual analogy—whether positive or negative—but by violent contrast, from absence of anyone to a crowd: Le tableau, dans son cadre de bois verni, représente une scène de cabaret. C'est une gravure en noir et blanc datant de l'autre siècle, ou une bonne reproduction. Un grand nombre de personnages emplit toute la scène, (p. 24) The people are then described in detail, including the proprietor, the group of bourgeois gentlemen, the gamin, and the three soldiers, who make a contrast of stillness with the crowd around them. The calligragraphic legend below the engraving "datant de l'autre siècle" is "La défaite de Reichenfels" (p. 26). Once again we are snatched for a second into a timeless continuum. But now the soldiers are further described and imperceptibly we slip into "reality." The boy (who was also on the picture, staring out of its proscenium frame or, in the "real" café, at the door) talks to the tired soldier (pp. 30-1), at semi-cross-purposes. (All the dialogue in the book, whether or not taking place at cross-roads, is at cross-purposes.) The soldier looks out. "Dehors il neige" (p. 31). Now the snowflakes are being chased horizontally by the newly risen wind. He looks for the street names, but the night (so it is now night) is too black (p. 31). He goes down a perpendicular street with similar lamps more widely spaced, "dont la clarté maigre illumine au passage la chute oblique des flocons" (p. 32). The snowflakes change direction, are quicker, are horizontal again, are vertical, horizontal, hit him in the face when he turns back, fall slowly now. The streets are perpendicular, parallel, the path he has just trod is "jalonné par l'alignement des lampadaires électriques" (pp. 31-2). The boy he meets (and later keeps meeting at various times) vanishes down the road, reappearing like a moth in the light of each lamp as he swings round it and runs on, his cape echoing the soldier's coat. "II fait jour de nouveau, le même jour terne et pâle. Mais le réverbère est éteint" (p. 41). The composition in motion is one of lines, circles and crosses, fairly simply at first, linking the street, the room with (probably) its picture, and the café, until the rhythm suddenly quickens at what may be termed the end of the first movement, with the dramatic scene in the ground-floor corridor into which the boy has led the soldier and then vanished through a door on the other side of the block (if it is the same boy); a woman comes out of a flat, screams and slams the door, another rushes upstairs, four or more 416 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">storeys (pp. 55-6); a third woman appears from a third door in the same corridor, they talk, he asks about a street, she tells him to wait, and before shutting her door says: "Fermez donc sur la rue ... il vient du froid dans toute la maison" (p. 58). The soldier walks back to the front door,26 shuts it and finds himself in the dark. He closes his eyes and sees the cross-roads, the lamps, the snow, the boy. For the first time we are definitely told that the soldier is visualising in memory, rather than (presumably) seeing what is being described. Here it acts as resolution of the main theme. But by the end of the book it has become part of a complicated pattern of data as experienced and/or re-experienced through fatigue and then through delirium. For the moment, however, the pattern continues over a more complex field of experience which now includes the woman, her one-legged lodger or lover, the boy, who seems to be her son, the barracks, as well as the room, the street and the café. At the opening of the "second movement," we are first back in the room ("De la commode à la table il y a six pas . . ." [p. 59]), then back in the corridor with the soldier and a quickening rhythm of patterns: Noir. Déclic. Clarté jaune. Déclic. Noir. Déclic. Clarté grise. Déclic. Noir. Et les pas qui résonnent sur le plancher du couloir. Et les pas qui résonnent sur l'asphalte, dans la rue figée par le gel. Et la neige qui commence à tomber. Et la silhouette intermittante du gamin qui s'amenuise, là-bas, de lampadaire en lampadaire, (p. 61) Sometimes the pattern of lines, circles and crosses is in minute close-up (e.g. "hachurée," of a man's hand, a metaphor which also occurs in Jalousie; or the circle and cross imprint of the boy's shoes in the snow). Sometimes it is in longshot. Sometimes it is slow, sometimes quick, like the snow, sometimes vertical sometimes horizontal, sometimes oblique. But always as part of a pattern of time passing within a timeless eye. Ill I have analysed these early pages in some detail in order to show how carefully Robbe-Grillet constructs his interrelations of space and time, turning them also to account as a means of creating the ambiguous and confusing atmosphere which the soldier is experiencing. Indeed the complexity of these interrelations in creases as more and more data crowd into his experience of what 85 Clearly the woman's flat is on the ground floor. See my comments pp. 414, 419. ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET 417</page><page sequence="14">turns out to be the last two conscious days of his life. The con tinual denial of significance, moreover, is part of that same experience, since rectilinear streets as such would tend not to have significance to him. But where there is analogy there is significance, even if limited to the fact of analogy, just as one of two parallel lines has the added significance of being parallel to the other, which it would not have by itself. Robbe-Grillet is not just playing a complex moving game of noughts and crosses with his circles, curves, squares and intercrossing lines that are "without significance." Significance is a matter of context. The soldier does not, at the time he is in the street, see the inside of the room; indeed, at this stage in the novel we do not know that he will be/has been/will die/has died inside that room. The slow dawning of a context is achieved by the semi-godlike, extra-temporal narrator. Yet the novel is not, despite its top-and-tailing in the first person, really reconstructed by the I-narrator, nor is it told by the soldier. It is an objective depersonalised recreation of the soldier's mental contents as he waits and walks in the street and sits in the café, sits in the woman's flat, sleeps at the barracks, walks the street, is shot from a motorbike, lies in the woman's flat. It is presented instantaneously, yet out of time, experienced and re-experienced through the dying soldier's delirium, when all the data of the preceding days have acquired a dream-like intensity that neverthe less confuses time, accuracy and even subjective identity, so that the soldier could be seeing himself from outside himself as well as reliving incidents and collocations of data with omissions, shifts, or added detail, as if through the expanding and contracting lens of memory and imagination; but instantaneously, merging with direct experience. The I-narrator at the end is simply a further telescopic removal, which rounds off (or frames) our sensation of having also experienced the data as reconstructed by him, or anyone else, outside. The point is important because it explains a certain ambiguity of perspective which is in effect a double ambiguity. First, there is the play on the paradox of what Günther Müller has called narrative time and narrated time,26 in the best Baroque tradition. For example, the shoe-box-shaped parcel. After the first café-scene (stemming from the picture) and the conversation " Erzählzeit und erzählte Zeit, Festschrift Paul Kluckhohn und Hermann Schneider gewidmet (Tübingen 1948, pp. 195-212). See also Lowry Nelson Jr., "The Uses of Time in Poetry" in Baroque Lyric Poetry (Yale University Press 1961), p. 29. 418 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="15">with the boy, the soldier is back in the street, and meets the boy, who takes him to the café, after which he is back in the street, meets the boy again, who asks him where he slept ("Par là—A la caserne?— Oui, si tu veux, à la caserne"—this long before the scene at the barracks), and also what he has in the box. When the boy has gone, the soldier looks at the windows in the grey façades, and suddenly the red curtains are being described, and the chest of drawers, and the picture. And on the picture the boy is sitting on the floor, staring at the foreground, holding the box in his arms. There follows a speculation on what the artist intended the boy to be staring at, presumably the door, though he is looking too low, etc. But now the real soldier comes in. The picture (called "The Battle of Reichenfels") dates from "the other century" (p. 24), and the boy on it is holding the shoe-box shaped parcel. Earlier still, immediately after the first introduction of the parcel under the soldier's arm, the box itself became the link, as the dust had been, back to the room with the chest of drawers: "La boîte enveloppée de papier brun se trouve maintenant sur la commode. Elle n'a plus sa ficelle blanche, et le papier d'emballage, soigneusement replié sur le côté du parallélépipède, bâille légèrement .... Juste au dessus est accroché le tableau . . ." (p. 22). This is the very first mention of the picture and at the same time a flash-forward to a time at the end of the novel, after the soldier's death, when the doctor-narrator finally opens the parcel, which turns out to be a biscuit-tin containing some letters from a girl to a soldier called Henri Martin, now dead, on whose behalf our soldier had been trying to deliver the box at an address he could not find or remem ber. But even the room, with its chest of drawers, red curtains, etc. is ambiguous. At first it seems to be high up (see ft. 24). The room in which the soldier has his bread and wine, talks to the woman and later dies, is however on the ground floor (see ft. 25). It also has a chest of drawers, red curtains, a crack on the ceiling etc. and its paths in the dust are made by the boy's felt slippers. Only the table is sometimes covered with a red and white check oilcloth (itself a link with the similar table in the café, as the woman is a link to the woman serving drinks in the café or in the picture). At one point the soldier notices that the red curtains are not made of heavy velour, but of a light material. There could thus be two almost identical rooms, one with the picture, belonging to the narrator, the box being on his chest of drawers; or the box is on the chest of drawers in the woman's flat, the front room of which the soldier is getting to know in intense but increasingly confused detail ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET 419</page><page sequence="16">during his illness. The latter is more likely, but the point is it doesn't matter. The high room could be the narrator's or it could be a confusion of the dying soldier who thinks, with the curtains drawn, that he is in a high room, merging it perhaps with the high room he later (i.e. earlier) is taken up to at the barracks, where he looks out of the window and sees himself knocking at the front door a moment before (and this too could be a memory fusion). Similarly he may be staring at the picture from the bed, thinking that it represents the café-scene through the glass-door and also fusing that with another crowded café or canteen scene nearer to the battlefield; and reading the inscription as The Battle of Reichenfels. We are made to see, creator-like, the same objects in different time scales, yet as instantaneously as language, which takes time, can make it. This is a very Baroque situation, in which the same object can be several things at once, or seen in two or three different per spectives simultaneously. Here it is achieved by analogy, and by apposition within the present tense (together with time and place auxiliaries like maintenant, dehors, etc.), rather than by metaphor, explicit paradox or other specifically Baroque methods. But it operates throughout as a means of structure which forces us to experience from inside the author's narrative time—itself identified with the strange processes inside the protagonist's mind—and not vicariously from our own time-scale. This first aspect of the double ambiguity is considerably enforced by the second aspect, namely the choice of a confused person as central figure or experiencer, who because of his condition is likely to get things out of the routine focus: here a lost and exhausted soldier, elsewhere a morbidly jealous husband, a delayed adolescent, a puz zled detective, or, in Marienbad, a woman disorientated by a hy perbolic extension of the "haven't-we-met-before" seduction line. The soldier's fatigue blurs the time-scale further. He does not know which day it is, only which part of the day. At one moment he has the number 12345 on his cape, which he tells the boy is not his number (because the cape is not his); at another the boy accuses him of having unsewn his number; later (i.e. earlier), in the barracks dormitory, his wet cape is taken from him and he is given another, with no number, with which he walks out in the middle of the night, in a high fever; in the café he has his number or he has not, he is taken for a deserter or he himself goes looking for a deserter in another room (a fusion with the barracks, itself a fusion with his previous barracks and the dying owner of the box); in the bar 420 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="17">racks dormitory there is no shelf behind the bed, and he puts the box under his pillow but suddenly there is a shelf and the box is on it (a memory of the other barracks). He sees objects with intense clarity but as he lies dying he feels the urge to make an inventory of everything in the room, the implication being that his obsessive concern for phenomena, indeed the entire book, is the desperate inventory of a dying man.27 He is not sure about anything, even whether it is the same boy he keeps meeting. IV I have used terms like close-up and links, but Robbe-Grillet's effects are essentially literary, despite his obvious affinity with the cinema. They could not be achieved by a camera without ominous close-ups which would of course enable us, the "normal" viewer, to remember and therefore not to be confuséd, not to be like the soldier; to be, that is, outside.28 Even without close-ups, one would remember the boy's face. One would certainly remember a sentence just uttered, and indeed in most books one would see it. Here, when the soldier is particularly confused, we are not given the actual sentence, only his feelings just before and perhaps while he speaks it ("Il faudrait imaginer une façon de partir pleine d'aisance . . [p. 72]) followed by his attempt to reconstruct it a moment later: "Le soldat essaye maintenant de se rappeler les termes exactes qu'il vient d'employer. Il y avait le mot 'caserne,' mais il ne parvient pas à se souvenir de la phrase bizarre qu'il a prononcée . . ." (p. 72). And in the phrase I quote on p. 408 the author achieves a similar effect by means of a very Baroque (and, as we now know, integral) comparison of a sentence to a legend at the foot of a picture (p. 147). Or again there is the scene (pp. 43-4) in which the boy in the snow under the lamp suddenly seems closer without apparently having moved. In a film this would merely seem like a closer close-up. Nor could a camera reproduce the speculative tone which from the very beginning makes one thing possibly something else (sans doute, si toutefois, peut-être, cette solution semble douteuse, etc.).29 Alternative suppositions are given about the most trivial objects, even the source of the dust or the dagger in the room, as if the observer were a "Cf. Beckett's Malone Dies, where Malone keeps saying he must make an inventory of his possessions before he dies. Similarly in Molloy: "When the time comes to draw up an inventory of my goods and possessions. Unless I lose them between now and then. But even lost they will have their place, in the inventory of my possessions. . . x This seems to me the only weakness in the film Marienbad. 28 Cf. Beckett's Watt: "Other possibilities occurred to Watt, in this connexion . . . etc." ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET 421</page><page sequence="18">detective ad absurdum, and paradoxically this makes phenomena not absurd but more quintessential, seen in all their possible beings. Things are not only perhaps something else but can even be some thing quite other than what they have just been described as, espe cially towards the end: "C'était ça que tu voulais me dire? —Non, répond le gamin, c'était pas ca." Alors ils ont entendu le bruit, très lointain, de la motocyclette. Non. C'était autre chose. Il fait noir. De nouveau c'est l'attaque, le bruit sec et saccadés des armes automatiques. ... (p. 160) And on p. 182: Le soldat est couché sur le dos, tout habillé. . . . Non. C'est en realité un autre blessé qui occupe la scène, à la sortie de la salle de café pleine de monde. Le soldat vient à peine d'en refermer la porte qu'il voit s'approcher de lun un jeune collègue, conscrit de l'année précédente .... [There follows a brief confusion with another soldier, a hero of Reichenfels, then the young man tells him that his friend is dying and calling for him.] Such denial is perhaps the nearest we come to the Baroque technique of particularising by taking the opposite into account, though here the very detail is built on analogy. The stream of consciousness did achieve something like this effect, but as a purely naturalistic reproduction of disorganised chaos and self-intrusions, and without the clear formal paradox of precision in space with a blurring of time which itself shifts the precision in space. Here we share the mental content of the confused soldier, but with such a high degree of formal patterning, selecting, and framing that another narrator is constantly implied both ever-present and im present at the same time, and always denying the very implication. Robbe-Grillet's refusal to find or to grant significance to phenomena has much the same opposite effect as occupatio or the refusal to describe, for it serves to emphasise that he has already given them and is continually giving them the significance of a complex and ever moving formal relationship to each other, as well as to the time-scale they inevitably move under. He may repeat "et cela ne signifie rien non plus" (p. 76), but his careful artistry belies the statement. And other statements are laid across that one, and others again, parallel, perpendicular, segmented and circular, by an analogical process based on the formal relationship of things but never announced by a change of tone or style, and only barely supported by almost imperceptible verbal devices, sometimes as simple as the "and" of Biblical narrative. 422 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="19">Yet, by the end of the novel, the snow (so dear to Baroque poets as an emblem of evanescence) has become inextricably bound with the time sequence and with the blurred process of the soldier's experience towards oblivion and death. So that, despite the author yet through his art, it has acquired a fleeting significance other than itself (p. 196): Et la couche nouvelle qui se dépose ainsi peu à peu sur les traces de la journée, arrondissant les angles, comblant les dépressions, nivelant les surfaces, a vite fait d'effacer les chemins jaunâtres laissés par les passants le long des maisons, les empreintes isolées du gamin, les deux sillons parallèles que le side-car a creusés au milieu de la chaussée. Mais il faudrait s'assurer, d'abord, que la neige tombe toujours. . . . ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET 423</page></plain_text>
