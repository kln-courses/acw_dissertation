<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ecrire l'animal aujourd'hui. Ed. by LUCILE DESBLACHE. (Les Cahiers de Recherche du Centre de Recherches sur les Litteratures Modernes et Contemporaines) Clermont-Ferrand: Presses Universitaires Blaise Pascal. 2oo6. 287 pp. E20. ISBN 978-2-845I6-308-9. Allegedly helpless kittens at one extreme, and sharks at the other: animals evoke in us humans a complex range of emotions from tenderness to terror. To a farmer, of course, they signify mainly a living from food, work (beasts of burden or traction), or they require extermination. All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others. (No contributor to this volume mentions Animal Farm.) How can carnivorous humans be other than ambivalent about the slaughter of animals? Some might protest cruelty en route to the abattoir. More fundamentalist protesters murderously assert animal rights, or, if philosophically inclined, indict speciesism. In her preface, the editor of this collection, Lucile Desblache, draws a line be tween the older tradition (reduce your own beastliness by focusing on beasts) and the contemporary 'Recognize your animality'. Either tactic uses animals for our pur poses. Can anyone write realistically, scientifically about animals without implicitly conveying an ethical, political, or other pointed message? Try a turnaround. Alain Montandon's leisurely analysis of some animal-fantasy stories by Haruki Murakami suggests that the uncanniness of the weird beasts represented there is ultimately de feated by the sheer banality, the vacuum, of the human world: a nice twist on the topos which classically argues the opposite proposition, the victory of the unusual. For Veronique Leonard-Roques, John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley and Paul Auster's Timbuktu exploit animals (dogs) as distancing agents. Auster's dog is cre dited with 'un regard de Huron' (p. 44), though it does not attain the Martian's-eye perspective of the canine in Queneau's Le Chiendent. Anthropomorphism rules, per haps inevitably, for how can we know, except in terms of pleasure or pain, fear or aggression, how an animal is reacting to our interventions? Though many people talk to animals, how many believe they are truly getting through? So animals are stand ins. Although in French stupidity and animals are inextricable (bete, betise, betifier-to talk asininely), though there are dogs and underdogs, in both these authors the dogs are equal picaresque heroes, and lend themselves to pointed humour. Steinbeck re cycles Don Quixote, with Charley reprising the lowly but wise Sancho Panza. Few contributors address the question of sentimentality, corniness. In a rare paper on the comic potentialities of animals, Isabelle Rabadi writes spiri tedly on the ludic world-upside-down of Eric Chevillard, where animals come more fully into their own by taking over from downsized humans. Those creatures that bite off a limb to escape a trap put people docilely handcuffed to a gendarme in the shade. Of course, verbal games are quintessentially human: nobody claims that chimps or whales pun. Nevertheless, Isabelle Ribadi persuasively salutes Chevillard's celebra tion of the elastic resources of language. She quotes his witty comment: 'J'aime bien les animaux, ce sont de droles de zebres, de droles d'oiseaux' (p. I04).</page><page sequence="2">MLR, I 02.2, 2007 47 I Anne Tomiche takes the nightingale in Romantic poetry (English, French, Ger man), which has been linked since antiquity with artistic creation, and investigates how some recent poets displace, play with, or subvert this commonplace. Thus Jacques Reda privileges the maddening, rattling snigger of the magpie, and Ted Hughes the harsh cawing of crows. For Tomiche, both poets, while anti-lyrical, re main Romantics. There is a bridge paper on mermaids, by Catherine d'Humieres, and another by Anne Wawrzyniak on Angela Carter's dystopian, gastroporn The Infernal Desire Ma chines of Doctor Hofman. This text attacks the systematic exploitation of animals, and of women, by men; it causes hybrids to proliferate, as the boundaries between humans and beasts are deleted. A goodly proportion of the articles is comparatiste, straddling and juxtaposing authors of differing cultural provenance (e.g. Japan/Cameroon). Is it too elitist to wonder whether concentrating on writers few readers or even fellow congressists have heard of is ecumenicalism gone off the rails? The reader has to take a great deal on trust; you cannot cross-check with your own interpretation. For instance, Bruno Sibona extends the castration complex he locates in or offloads onto one Hugo poem to three contemporary poets beyond our ken. All in all, the prescribed topic appears to have brought out the sensitivity and em pathy of the twenty contributors. I miss, however, the bullfight, unthinkable to many people who love animals more than fellow humans. These rituals are not a sport, and so equality of opportunity is not relevant. Hemingway and Montherlant would have provided a welcome break from the prevalent political correctness of the volume. I also miss parrots. Dumb beasts may have their own languages, corporeal or vocal. Jean-Paul Enge libert lights on the more formal aspects of the man-beast confrontation: how to give language to the wordless. This is at root a political question: how to empower the powerless? We hunt animals for their flesh, skin, or aphrodisiac secretions. In retali ation, wilfully or not, they haunt, or more ironically people, our imaginations, all our fables and bestiaries. Of course, God set the ball rolling in the mastery stakes.
