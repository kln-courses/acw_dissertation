I would not speak so boldly if it were my due to be be lieved. Yet I must assert that where anything is growing, one "former" is worth a thousand reformers. Within this perspective, I have come to ana lyze a recent article entitled "Blind Alleys." Thoreau once said that "some cir cumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk." In the same context, Peter H. Wagschal's metaphor of a fish "furiously flop ping" on the edge of a stream to some extent depicts finding a trout in one's pocket Aristotle. Indeed, I agree that one no longer has to go to the theater to witness the absurd; one needs only to read "Blind Alleys." Mr. Wagschal combines qualities of transcendental Darwinism, paradoxical social intentions, ambivalent group norms, and terrible contemporary trends to demonstrate the America of 1971. Consequently, his argument projects a somniferous penchant which reduces the reader to a somnambulant condition. Indeed, one might contend that the bewildered piscator's argu ment consists of amusing the patient while nature cures the disease. In essence, Mr. Wagschal's transmogrifica tion of existing societal conditions might compel one to conclude that his seemingly bizarre display of scholar ship does merit at least one cast. After all, the next one might not get away! - George A. Antonelli, instructor, Department of Secondary Education, Southern Illinois University. Or Blind Alley? With the literary magic of a Loren Eisely, Mr. Wagschal has led us down a "blind alley." Some members of our species, lately thrust into strange and polluted environments, writhe in the direction of "return, return!" But oth ers among us thrive; we are equipped to handle some of the horrors and rewards of our changing technological world. For our species continues to evolve. It is anthropomorphic to assume that "Nature" errs in her experimenta tion. Darwin's theory is based on a mathematical, probabilistic chance model. Species survive as they are equipped. There is no mud-monster in the wings. It is only a phantasm from Mr. Wagschal's nightmare. That "spar kle of rising life," that "degree of compassion and humility," can appear only in man's visage ? for those qualities demand cognition and human emotion. We are the generalized, versa tile lungfish of two worlds. Our cortex is the difference between horizons of new directions and blind-alley canyons of extinction. Mr. Wagschal's first fish catch, with its spasmodic, indomitable writhing toward water, succeeded in its attempt to live. May we continue to have the same courage and persever ance. - D. Thomas King, consultant, Saint Paul Public Schools. For a Teaching Profession I enjoyed reading the review of Leaders in American Education in the March Kappan. I have strong disagree ment with Mr. Spears, however, on May, 1971 571</page><page sequence="2">two points. First, he states that educa tion is a "profession alongside medi cine and the others." Second, he be lieves administrators will keep educa tion a profession. Assuming the former is true (which it is not), he is present ing us with an implicit analogy: Hospi tal administrators must likewise labor to keep medicine a profession. Sorry. Administrators are often worthy, but if education ever does achieve profes sional status by any definitive criteria, teachers will do it, as doctors have for medicine. - Michael T. Hinkemeyer, assistant professor, Saint Mary's Col lege, Notre Dame, Ind. Talks Back to Balktalker The letter from Thomas E. Robin son (March, 1971, Kappan) irritates me immensely! "Students attend of their own volition"; "professors, high ly trained"; "what faculty accountabil ity might do for higher education." What it might do, indeed! Some students do attend colleges and universities of their own volition. But many attend to avoid military service or because their parents expect them to. And many who do want to attend have social activities as their major goal. Few truly have growth in knowledge and understanding as their purpose when they enter college be cause too many of them have not had this concept implanted in their mind in the secondary schools. A large part of the professors have no training - or very little - in the process of teaching. They have knowl edge of subject matter but no under standing whatsoever of the principles of organization and the processes of communication. They are the "seers" of all ages who, with great profundity, disperse knowledge with scattershot abandon. A random bit of information may find its target, but a large part of the effort is wasted. And as for accountability - that was a popular procedure a half century ago and the teachers devoted their time to coaching the pupils to pass the final state exam. The education proc ess degenerated to coaching the pupil in his memorization of a narrow range of facts and processes. And if this comes into use again we might just as well forget that we are to teach under standing and appreciation. - O. B. Stamper, Oklahoma Christian College. Disclaimer by Blaschke Stanley Elam's "Chameleon's Dish" in the March issue pointed out the difficulties in conceiving and imple menting an innovative concept in the field of education. If bastardization does not occur in the conjugal bed, it certainly occurs during the toddler's stage. Neither the critics of perform ance contracting who refer to it as hucksterism nor the zealots who label it a "panacea" do justice to this management concept which is limited from a technical point of view and by the intentions of people who utilize it. While there do exist opportunities for innovation during a crisis atmosphere, I hope that the advocates of perform ance contracting would not unwitting ly increase expectations and aspira tions of so many school officials grasp ing for straws. While I appreciated Elam's gracious comments for Education Turnkey News, I want to correct the possible impression that its morsels of wisdom relating to performance contracting come from me. The reporting, analy ses, and planning guidelines #can be attributed to the entire staff but par ticularly to the editor, Reed Martin; our contracts negotiator; and Peter Briggs, a former special assistant to former Commissioner Leon Lessinger. Briggs was involved during the recon struction or early birth of the concept of accountability at the U.S. Office of Education. ? Charles Blaschke, presi dent, Education Turnkey Systems. More on Voc Ed In the February issue of the Phi Delta Kappan I read with interest Eli Ginzberg's article, "Vocational Educa tion Is Not the Answer." This article is also not the answer. Yet it is an inspiration to anyone interested in the educational programs provided under the title "vocational." The reason this article does not do justice to Mr. Venn's book is that there is no proof or reference to proof for some very liberal yet controversial statements by Mr. Ginzberg. I would appreciate receiving evi dence of research on the following statements of Mr. Ginzberg: 1) "There is no firm evidence pointing to an acceleration of technological change"; 2) "simple jobs are not disappearing very fast" (how fast is very fast?); 3) "most school dropouts get jobs"; 4) "we can [not] structure jobs and work so that everybody, or most people, can enjoy meaningful careers"; and 5) "the vast majority [how many is vast?] of the oncoming generation will work with paper and pencil, with type writers, calculators, computers, and testing equipment." The resources behind these state ments would be very beneficial to me and my colleagues in determining fu ture programs and curricula. - A. A. Van Fleet, principal, Parkview Junior Vocational School, Hamilton, Ontario. Suspense in Gary "The Perils of Pauline" have noth ing superior to the suspense in "The Performance Contract in Gary" (March Kappan). Please assure us that we will learn in the next issue if BRL hit the meatgrinder in School City. Were the pupils saved before the bell by GTU? Did CURE show that a New York outfit can operate effectively and prof itably in the Midwest? Can we forget teachers and move confidently to the use of technicians in the schools of tomorrow? Did the General Commission of the ISB force BRL to face up to the hidden gimmicks in an alleged con tract? Who did what to who (or Is it whom)? We can't wait! - Irvin A. Himmele, Buffalo, N.Y. Evaluation in Gary Regarding the evaluation of the performance contract in Gary (March, 1971, Kappan), one wonders if the Metropolitan Achievement Tests are to provide the criteria for determining whether BRL is paid for student achievement. Disregarding the spurious element due to pupil practice, it would be very easy to demonstrate "unusual" growth using a test which includes a "don't know" distractor (see Warren Findley's review, page 65, The Sixth Mental Measurement Yearbook). If the Gary Teachers Union were to raise such an objection, what would BRL use as a response? - Darrell Sabers, associate professor, College of Education, University of Arizona. 572 PHI DELTA KAPPAN</page><page sequence="3">Students in Gary I read with great interest the arti cles on performance contracting in jthe March issue. It seems to me that Martin and Blaschke and Mecklen burger and Wilson did a fine job of posing questions and attempting to dig up answers about this subject; surely the performance contract will be one of the most discussed issues in educa tion in the 70's. One thing did bother me about these otherwise excellent articles; namely, not once was there any men tion of how the students themselves like the BRL program. We learned how the teachers' union reacted, how the school board felt, what various BRL personnel had to say, how the state administrators viewed the contract, but no one seemed interested in how the ultimate consumers - the pupils - were responding. Could we perhaps have a footnote on this in a future issue? - James V. McConnell, profes sor of psychology, University of Michi gan. Protest from Overseas This is to protest implications made by Michael L. Berger in his article, "A Case Against Cost Efficiency: Educa tion and the Military" (January Kappan). For one thing, the photograph is terribly out of date (the American school at Nouasser has been closed for several years); it shows young boys in a kind of uniform dress, suggesting a military academy setting. Boys and girls in the Overseas Dependents Schools are as civilian as are students in any school in America - and their dress and manner reflect the same fads (good and bad) found in any American school. Parts of his text are also misleading. The Department of Defense does not have a limited number of applicants. It has, in fact, more than 11,000 bona fide teacher applicants for fewer than 300 teaching vacancies. We are able to select teaching candidates from the cream of U.S. teaching ranks and from every major school district in the United States. His statement about seeing Europe at Uncle Sam's expense is certainly a negative one. No one will deny that our teachers and administrators work in this program in part because it brings us intercultural experiences, travel opportunities, and ever-changing life-styles. We enjoy going wherever we can to learn whatever we can and to integrate our discoveries into our psyches in order to become more exciting, more sensitive persons in our educational work. I resent having this curiosity 'and these characteristics re duced to the word "sightseer." I also resent Mr. Berger's claims that the army-could "select only the top teachers and create, on paper at least, one of the best public school facilities on overseas American soil." We have already done that, and I wouldn't restrict that claim to overseas Ameri can soil. Our school system is one of the best staffed, most innovative, and most effective major school systems affecting American life. - Allen Dale Olson, United States Dependents Schools, Karlsruhe, Germany. Is Anti-Educationese Anti-Intellectual? Your editorial in the March issue of the Kappan in which you offered some preliminary findings from your recent reader survey reports a blatant theme of anti-intellectualism among the re spondents that bodes no good for the profession. You were nice about it by reporting that there was an interest in "more attention to the practical prob lems of teaching in place of abstract theory by education professors." The actual quotations you printed, how ever, suggest extreme hostility toward educational professionals, intellectuals, and the posture of reason and science: Save the philosophical "gib gosh" for educators' conven tions. More honest, down-to-earth teachers' problems and not pseud o-administration-political catering-to-the-power-structure trash. Schools of education and their products are bores! Fewer contributions by the es tablished, highly degreed, so called experts. I make no attempt to defend the dull, poorly thought-out or badly writ ten article, whatever its source. We do need the mixture of reporting of actu al teaching experiences, theoretical analysis, reporting of research, descrip tion of teaching technology and of administrative practices, elementary school topics as well as secondary and college matters, etc. Some of your commentators ask for this balance and others ask for more in their areas of special interest. Serving the entire pro fession well probably is an impossible task, but the attempt needs to be made. But the problem I note is a differ ent one than a failure to provide adequate coverage of all the diverse interests of your readers. A theme that runs through your quotations is the rejection of the intellectual process. Theoretical proposals, professional criticism, analysis of public issues as to their relevance to educational proc esses, so-called radical proposals for change ? reports and debates of these sorts are central to our responsibilities as educators. If teachers reject intellec tual criticism of their profession what legitimacy do they have left? American society has been plagued by violent undercurrents of anti intellectualism throughout its history. (Remember the "egghead" epitaph lev eled against Adlai Stevenson?) If the teaching profession will not stand against this disease what chance is there for the growth of rational hu manism in our time? ? Donald C. Jones, program coordinator, business administration, Chicago State College. Stick to Your Guns! "... While the editors cannot hope to please every reader, they want to respond to the main currents of reader interest." Your casual inspection indicates the need for direction and change in the teaching profession. If, indeed, your fine magazine regears its editorial poli cy and purposes to accommodate the "most frequent requests," you will become one more agent to resist change. God knows, we have enough of that in our business. If you believe in the philosophy which you've set up ?for yourselves, don't become another "how-to" school teachers' magazine. Provide vision and perspective, priori ties and compassion, controversy and thinking. Don't sell out. - W. E. Gutzman, Department of Education, University of Maine. D May,1971 573</page></plain_text>
