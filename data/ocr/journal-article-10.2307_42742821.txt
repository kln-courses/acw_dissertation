<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MARXISM By VISHWANATH PRASAD VA RM A ( I ) Epistemological Foundations of Marxism1 According to Marx 'truth' is not the passive reflex of the object. The older materialism emphasised a sensationalistic epistemology and hence they did not elaborate the historically dynamic role of the subject in the genesis of knowledge. But according to dialectical materialism the external object of knowledge is not an eternally static entity. The progressive action and operation of the subject leads to a transformation in the nature of the object.® Knowledge is thus the resultant of the dynamic interaction between the subject and the I. Engels writes : "For [ dialectical philosophy ] nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything, nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of the process in the thinking brain." Dialectics according to Marx is applicable both to mental formalistic logic and to external world. Dialectics, according to Lenin, includes the theory of cognition, gnoseology or epistemology, a science that must contemplate its subject matter historically, studying and generalizing the origin and development of cognition. The following quotation from Marx contains the essence of the epistemological foundation of dialectical materialism. "To Hegel the liferprocess of the human brain, i. e. the process of thinking, which, under the name of the •idea* he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiwrgos of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of the idea. With me on the contrary, the idea is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and trans- lated into forms of thought." ( Marx : Preface to the second edition of Capital , Vol. I ) 2. Engels, Dialectics of Nature p. 172 : "Natural science, like philosophy, has hitherto entirely neglected the influence of men's activity on their thought; both know only nature on the one hana and thought on the other. But it is precisely the alteration of nature by man , not solely natures as such, which is the most essential and immediate basis of human thougnt, and it is in the measure that man has learned to change nature that his intelligence has increased. The materialistic conception of history as found, for instance, to a greater or lesser extent in Draper and other scientists, as if nature exclusively reacts on man, and natural conditions everywhere exclusively determined his historical development, is therefore one-sided and forgets that man also reacts on nature, changing it and creating new conditions of existence for himself . ... 1 he earth s surface, climate, vegetation, fauna and the human beings themselve have continually changed, and all this owing to human activity."

But in defence of Russell it can be said that if by activistic nature of truth he meant the sociological process of the testing of the particular sets of philosophical theories in socio-historical practice he is correct in ascribing to Marx primacy in this type of intellectual enterprise. Sometimes it is maintained that the Marxian view of the activi- stic nature of the subject in the epistemologica! process was lost sight of by Engels and Lenin.6 we accept this view to a limited extent. Engels and Lenin emphasised dynamic activism in their social and political philosophy when they were concerned with the tactics of seizure of power but in their epistemology they seem to have forgotten the dialectical theory of perception referred to in the "Theses on Feuerbach". There is no doubt that Engels in "Ludwig Feuerbach" and Lenin in "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" generally have a theory of passive sensation. Much more than Engels, Lenin always refers to the 'image' theory of sensations.6 He often speaks of matter s. G. Plekhanov, Fundamental Problems of Marxism, p. 13, : "The inclination to contemplate the action and reaction between the object and the subject primarily from the point of view of the active part played by the subject was the reflexion of the state of mind which animated society in the days when Marx and Engels were forming their outlook on the universe. The revolution of 1848 was close at hand." Plekhanov thus makes an attempt to correlate the Marxian theory of knowledge with the contemporary socio-economic conditions of Europe. 2. In Fichte and Schopenhauer we find the conception of self-activity. The biolo- gical conception of activity in American thought is closer to the Marxist stand point. 3. But as a matter of fact Marxists, Santayana, Husserl, and the British empiricists try to evade the subtle problems raised by Kantian epistemology. 4. B.

Lenin's basic proof for the philoso- phical substantiation of materialism is that the collective sensation and experience of mankind indicate the existence of a mobile external material reality. Bat modern scientific critical realism accepts per- ceptual experience only as evidence for knowledge and conceptually tries to organize that into knowledge.* Furthermore, Hegel tried to discard the adequacy of immediate knowledge but Lenin in his dogmatic passion and fury against bourgeois professors does not care for subtle philosophical distinctions.* Marxian dialectical materialism believes in the veracity of socio- historically tested scientific theories. Engels refers to experiment and industry being the sufficient antidotes to Humean scepticism and Kan- tian agnosticism. 4 We have maintained earlier that Engels' agnostic i. Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism , p. 374 : "Social consciousness reflects social being that is Marx's teaching. A reflection may be an approximately true copy oí the reflected, but to speak of identity is absurd. Consciousness in general reflects being that is a general principle or all materialism." Again on p. 323 : "The world is the movement of this objective reality reflected by our consciousness. To the movement of ideas, perceptions etc., there corresponds the movement of matter outside me« The concept matter expresses nothing more than the objective reality which is given us in sensation." Again on p. 250: "The mastery of nature manifested in human practice is a result of an objectively correct reflection within the the human head of the phenomena and processes of nature, and is proof of the fact that this reflection ( within the limits of what is revealed by practice ) is objective, absolute and eternal truth." And again on p. 192 : "Matter is a philosophical category designating the objective reality which is given to man by his sensations, and which is copied , photographed and reflected by our sensations, while existing independently of them." Possibly Lenin's image theory of knowledge may fit into the theory of sensationalism as modified by modern sense psychology. 2. Essays in Critical Realism , Chapter II. 3. In modern scientific philosophy there is greater stress on the correspondence than on the reflection theory of knowledge. According to Hegel, immediacy is the thesis, reflective thought is the antithesis and self-conciousness is the synthesis. 4. F. Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach ( New York, 1934 ) PP* 32"33 : 'The most telling refutation of this (agnosticism), as of all philosophical fancies, is practice, viz. , experiment and industry. If we are able to prove the correctness of our conception of a natural process by making it for ourselves, bringing it into being out of its conditions, and using it for our purposes into the bargain, then there is an end of the Kantian incomprehensible 'thing-in-itself." Socialism , Utopian and Scientific (New York, 1935) p. 14 : "And whenever we find ourselves face to face with a failure, then we are generally not long in making out the cause that made us fail, we find that the preception upon which we acted was either incomplete and superficial, or combined with the result of other perceptions in a way, not warranted by them- what we call defective reasoning." Dialectical materialism is anti-agnoticism. Kant's unknowable Thing-in-itself, or Spencer's Unknowable Conditions do not exist as such. Engels accepts the Hegelian view that the moment all the qualities of a thing are known, the thing itself is known. According to him the rise of science tends to shatter the mystical view of the unknowability of Phenomena.</page><page sequence="4">2t&gt;4 VISHWANATH PRASAD VARMA interpretation of Kant is incorrect. Kant would go all the way along with Engels in accepting scientific knowledge; as a matter of fact the whole theme of the Critique of Pure Reason is to construct philosophical knowledge on the model of the necessary and universal knowledge of mathematics. Engels' remarks against Humean scepticism are correct. Kant tried once móre to rescue science and philosophy from the attacks of Hume on them by his reduction of causality to a psychological custom. But inspite of its opposition to Humeanism and Kantianism Marxism itself has been seriously challenged for its acceptance of relativism of knowledge.1 Knowledge according to Marxism is not an absolute eternal body of scientific propositions bur is a dialectical process of ever-expanding growth where incomplete and inexact knowledge is being transformed into more comprehensive knowledge.3 But this means that perfect certitude is an impossibility. If every theory is only partially representative of the objective reality then Marxism itself is only a relative truth. But to save himself from this difficult position Lenin accepted that absolute truth results from the sum-total of relative truths in the course of their existence;8 relative truths represent relatively faithful reflections of an object existing independently of man; these reflections become more and more faithful and every scientific truth notwithstanding its relative nature contains I. Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, p. 199: "We are relativists proclaim Mach, Avenarius and Petzoldt. We are relativists, echo Mr. Chernov and certain Russian Machians .... For to make relativism the basis of the theory of knowledge is inevitably to condemn oneself either to absolute scepticism, agnosticism and sophistry, or to subjec- tivism. Relativism as the basis of the theory of knowledge is not only the recognition of the relativity of our knowledge, but also a denial of any objective measure or model existing independently of humanity to which our relative knowledge approximates .... Dialectics - as Hegel in his time explained - contains an element of relativism, of negation, of scepticism, but it is not reducible to relativism. The materialist dialectics of Marx and Engels certainly does contain relativism, but is not reducible to relativism, that is, it recognises the relativity of all our knowledge, not in the sense of the denial of objective truth, but in the sense of the historically conditioned nature of the limits of the appro- ximation of our knowledge of this truth." 2. F. Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach ( New York, 1634 ), p. 55 : "The demand for final solutions and eternal truths ceases once for all; one is always conscious of the necessary limitations of all acquired knowledge, of the fact that it is conditioned by the circumst- ances in which it was acquired, That which is recognized now as true has also its latent false side which will later manifest itself, just as that which is now regarded as false has also its true side by virtue of which it could previously have been regarded as true." 3. Lenin, M ater ali sm and Empirio-Criticism , p. 197 : "Human thought then by its nature is capable of giving, and does give, absolute truth, which is compounded of a sum total of relative truths. Each step in the development of science adds new grains to the sum of absolute truth, but the limits of the truth of each scientific proposition are relative, now expanding, now shrinking with the growth of knowledge."</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHIC A L FOUND A TION OF MARXISM 205. an element of absolute truth. This view of Lenin seems utterly unsci- entific. An asboluté truth can never be the aggregate of relative truths. No doubt, no theory in science is absolutely false but it makes little contribution to knowledge to say that it contains some elements of relative truth. Lenin does not seem to care for the logical necessity involved in absolute truths. If he accepts that absolute truth is the sum total of relative truths it is not possible to see the logical reasons of his objections to the relativism of Duhem and Stallo in physics.1 According to Duhem a law of physics, properly speaking is neither true, nor false but approximate.* Lenin dogmati- cally asserts that because Duhem, Stallo, Mach and Poincaré do not give a correct formulation of relativism they slide from the latter into idealism* but he does not give any solid argument for this. In the Marxian theory socio-historical revolutionary practice is the criterion of the validity of knowledge.4 The older mechanical materialism discussed the question of truth apart from its connection with socio-historical practice. Emphasis on revolutionary practice brings out the role of Marxism as the philosophy of the revolutionary proletariat ( and consequently Marxism cannot claim to be a complete philosophy for all peoples ). Every social class has its own criterion of practice and along with the historical development of the class this criterion also changes. But the emphasis on practice does not mean the replacement of scientific rational argumentation by it but rather its supplementation by it. According to Lenin practice is higher than theoretical knowledge because it has not only the virtue of generality i. J. B.

II these perceptions have been wrong, then our estimate of the use to which an object can be turned must also be wrong, and our attempt must fail. But if we succeed in accomplishing our aim, if we find that the object does agree with our idea of it and does answer the purpose we intended it for, then there is positive proof that our perceptions of it and of its qualities, so far agree with reality outside ourselves." K. Marx, Theses on Feuerbach : "The question whether objective truth is an attribute of human thought- is not a theoretical but a practical question. Man must prove the truth, 1. e . the reality and power, the "this-sidedness" of his thinking in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-realjty of thinking that is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question . . . The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-changing can only be comprehended and rationally understood as revolutionary practice All social life is esentially practical. All the theories which urge theory into mysticism find their rational solution m human practice and is the comprehension of this practice."</page><page sequence="6">2O6 VISHWANA TH PRASAD VARMA but also of immediate actuality. Hence it has been pointed out by the Marxists that even under a bourgeois era a logical materialistic attitude is possible only for the proletariat because not the parasitic capitalists enjoying surplus value but the workers come into actual immediate contact with machines and raw materials. Albert levy says : "Marx's idea, then, is the following : just as to our ideas there correspond real objects outside us, so to our phenomenal activity there corresponds a real activity outside us, an activity of things. In this sense humanity partakes of the absolute, not only through theoretical knowledge but also through practical activity, thus all human activity acquires a dignity, a nobility, that permits it to advance hand in hand with theory. Revolutionary activity henceforth acquires a metaphy- sical significance."1 Thus in the marxian sense human activity is not only phenome- nal, but has on objectively real significance. Knowledge can be ideologically useful, and useful for human advancement only if it corresponds to an objective reality. Feuerbach also considers the sum-total of human practice to be the basis of the theory of knowledge. Lenin points out that the criterion of practice can never in the nature of things either confirm or refute any human idea completely but this criterion is sufficiently indefinite not to allow human knowledge to become absolute, but it is sufficiently definite to fight against agnosti- cism and idealism.' But in his defence of the Newtonian conception of space and time against the attacks of Mach, on the ground of the former's success throughout the course of centuries, Lenin's appeal to the criterion of practice* does not seem convincing and correct at all, because those Newtonian ideas have now been challenged. The Marxian criterion of practice is more sociological4 than the Cartesian or Kantian criterion of truth. Descartes emphasised I. Albert Levy, Feuerbach' s Philosophy and his Influence on German Literature, Paris 1904, pp. 290-291, quoted in Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, p. 169. 2, Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, (Selected Works of Lenin. Vol. XI), 206. 3. Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism , p. 240. 4 . But we think that the notion of practice as the criterion of truth is a mi statement. An object does not become true because of its practical efficiency and efficacy but its efficiency and efficacy are lunctions of its truth. Furthermore Aristotle has pointed out that the human mind can contemplate reason without there being an objectivization of it and this will go against the Marxist thesis of practice being the criterion of truth; Aristotle, Politics VII, 3 : "... . nor are those ideas only to be regarded as practical which are pursued for the sake of practical results, but much more the thoughts and contempla- tions which are independent and complete in themselves</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL FOUND A TION OF MARXISM 207 clear and distinct ideas and he accepted both the correspondence and the coherence theories of truth. Kant emphasised the necessity and universality of knowledge. According to the Hegelian dialectic every statement is true in some respect. The Marxian emphasis on practice seems to have a remote similarity to the probabilism of the ancient academicians like Carneades. Bacon also speaks of the fruitfulness of knowledge and Descartes spoke of controlling the elements through a knowledge of them. In Buddhism and Vedantism also practical use of knowledge is emphasised but not for terrestrial success but for the attainment of fina] gnosis, Nirvana and supracosmic transcendent bliss.1 This emphasis on practice has led Bertrand Russell* to charac- terize Marxism as instrumentalism. Sometimes Marxism has been compared to pragmatism. Bukharin says that the chief mistake of pragmatism is the fundamentally incorrect conception of practice as a theoretically knowable factor. In reality only such a practice may have meaning as changes the material world ( revolutionary praxis ). Only in such a case is the criterion of practice not separated from the criterion of correspondence with reality.* Lenin especially attacked the pragmatic denial of the absolute character of scientific knowledge. Analysing the sociology of pragmatist knowledge Marxists assert that pragmatism is a theory of the decaying bourgeois monopoly capitalism because its denial of objective truth is meant to hypnotize and intelle- ctually confuse the workers by implying that the actual social and economic contradictions are not to be scientifically studied. Further- more, the Marxists say that practice in pragmatism means only the practical interests of the agents of capitalist production. But we think this is a gross overstatement inspired by motives of social propaganda and is not a logical argument. Epistemologically, both Marxism and pragmatism attack the spectator theory of knowledge which was upheld from Locke to Hume. X. Hence sometimes it is said that Buddhism and Vedantism are types of spiritual pragmatism because they stress that knowledge is to be pursued not because rational contemplation is the highest form of activity but because it leads to the negation of mundane evils and the attainment of emancipation. Hence in the latter Bhakti move- ments inspired by Vedanta we find a condemnation of logical conceptualism and emphasis only on emotional and aesthetic apprehension of the deity. Inspite of the emphasis on only Bodki Vijttana and Chita it remains true that in Indian thought rational contemplation and logical understanding are never regarded as final ends of man. a. Russell ; Freedom Versus urgamsatton, p. ìy*. 3 Bukharin's article in Marxism and Modern Thought, pp. 25-™- According Bukharin 3 pragmatism is logically unsustainable because it expands the conception of experience to include any kind of individual experience.</page><page sequence="8">2o8 VISHWANATH PRASAD VA RM A Marxists and pragmatists have got the main point of their criticism from neo-Hegelians. Russell and G. E. Moore tried to revive the empirico-critical theory in the form of "the theory of the sensa." Whitehead joined the pragmatists like James and Dewey and other idealists in the attack on Russell and Moore. At times when Lenin emphasises the copy or image theory of knowledge he just becomes Lockean ( in his books concerning strategy and tactics, however, Lenin takes a revolutionary dynamic point of view with regard to the human subject ). Thus according to Lenin sense-perception is knowledge but according to Dewey sense-perception is only the evidence for knowledge.1 Both Pragmatism and Marxism emphasize the realization of ideas rather than their theoretical expression. Pragmatism is not concerned with metaphysics, but primarily is a theory of knowledge. Marxism is not a theory of knowledge but primarily is an ontology. Contrasted to Marxism, pragmatism has no philosophy of history. Sometimes it is said that pragmatism emphasises subjective action and Marxism objective action. But only some pragmatists take a subjective view of action. According to some pragmatists ideas are functional rather than substantial and their relation to their objects is not one of resem- blance but of leading and guidance. Bradley in criticising this view said that if ideas are to work they must correspond to a determinate being which they do not create.* Marxists will take a position similar to that of Bradley in this respect. Engels and Lenin always condemn the materialism of Büchner, Vogt and Moleschott • as vulgar.4 Certainly the materialism of the I. J. Dewey, Experience and Nature , p. 182. 2.

Thus the laws of physics hold for all things inanimate or living; but the laws of biology, although they rest upon the law of physics, are distinct and cannot be deduced from them. Simi- larly the laws of biology hold for all living things human or non-human , but the laws of human psychology, although they rest upon the laws of biology, cannot be deduced from them. The recognition that the law of mechanics, biology and other sciences contain unique qualitative elements is the great differentiating mark between 'Vulgar* and dialectical materialism."

Büchner had no consistent epistemology. Sometimes he regarded thought as motion, sometimes considered thought as the effect of motion and sometimes viewed thought as indissolubly connected with motion. Commenting on Buchner's theory of knowledge Paulsen says : [ in Buchner ] "Influxus physicus, parallelism, Identities, and the popular conceptions, Spinoza, Kant - all these stagger around like drunkards."8 In a letter to Kugelmann (June 27, 1870) Marx refers contemptuously to Buchner, Lange Duhring, Fechner, etc. because they did not understand Hegelian dialectics.* Although Fechner held the view that if stimulus increases in geometrical progression sensation increases only in arithmetical progression still he was deeply metaphysical and accepted the immortality of soul and hence he could not appeal to Marx and Engels. Joseph Dietzgen arrived at dialectical materialism4 indepen- dently of Marx and Engels but his views are not fully scientific. Dietzgen considered that mind differs no more from table, sight or sound than these things differ from each other. According to Lenin the assertion that thought is material is a step in the direction of idealism but he does not try to elaborate his criticism. Dietzgen wanted a broadening of the concept of matter to embrace all the phenomena of reality as well as our faculty of knowing or explaining it.8 The inclusion of thoughts among matter would introduce an episte- mologica! muddle since it would destroy the distinctness and separate- ness of the object and the subject with which any sound theory of knowledge starts. i . In the 19th century, materialism received a further impetus from the rise of physiological psychology especially associated with the name of Wundt. Hume's reduc- tion of mind to a succession of psychic phenomena received a further confirmation in the writings of William James, Professor Stout and Bertrand Russell and was centuries ago formulated in great details by the Buddhist philosophers. The rise of scientific investiga- tions further strengthened the materialistic philosophy because it shattered to pieces the Old Testament cosmology. 2.

Engels tried to make a comprehensive statement of dialectical materialism when Duhring challenged the Marxian Theory.1 Lenin claims that recent researches in physics support dialectical materialism and such claims have been advanced by Haldane and Bernal and to some extent even by Levy.® Hence we shall make some attempts to see as to what extent dialecti- cal materialism can be substantiated by the philosophical implications of scientific researches. Mach and Petzoldt argued that natural-scientific materialism is metaphysics,* and hence pointed out that it was sheer nive realism to assert the existence of an objective reality underlying the theories and conclusion of science. This point of view of positive physics is also upheld by some idealists, Kantians and Humeans4 since according to them acceptance of an immutable external world signifies transcen- dence of the bounds of experience. Lenin appeals lo the collective every day concrete experience of mankind in support of his thesis that materialism is not transcendental metaphysics. Marxists do not accept any real gap between the appearance and the thing-in-itself and hence they condemn the problem of transcendence as illusory. The Marxist standpoint is correct to the extent that human beings do certainly have perception of material things but Lenin cannot deny that the formulation of the concept of an eternal quantitative matter I.

In face of the fact that a voluminous mass of literature on the philosophical and scientific aspect of dialectical materialism has been produced in the twentieth century. John Plamenatz is only showing his great ignorance when he says : 'It is best, I think, for a number of reasons, to say as little as possible about dialectical materialism.

The conviction of the 'naive realists' (in other words, of all humanity) that our sensations are images of an objectively real external world is the conviction of the mass of scientists, one that is steadily growing and gaining in strength." 4.

It is a scientific concept and it cannot be denied that it has an element of abstraction in it.1 At times it is almost difficult to sympathise with Lenin's vehement dogmatism indicated in his state- ment that objective reality cannot be scientifically formulated except in terms of the general appréhension of everyday physical objects. Bazarov - the Russian Machist, criticised Marxian materialism because Engels' view of absolute time and space had become obsolete. Lenin, who along with Engels was an advocate of the Newtonian views on space and time, tried to save his theory on the ground that human conceptions of time and space may be relative but they do not interfere with the immutability of the fact that man and nature exist only in time and space.® When Lenin wrote (in 1908) the 'relativity' and 'quantum theories' were not yet famous and hence he had to fight with the theories of Mach, Poincaré and Pearson who challenged the Newtonian views.* According to Mach, space and time are well- ordered systems of series of sensations. In his Mechanik he defended the mathematicians investigating the problem of conceivable spaces with 'n' dimensions. According to Poincaré space and time are relative and they are imposed by human beings on nature and not by nature on human beings. Pearson's views on this subject are similar to the ~ I. cf. Hegel. Encyclopedia quoted in Engels, Dialectics of Nature , pp. 362-363 : "It is certainly a fact of experience, that, if one of two purses filled with shillings is twice as heavy as the other, the reason must be, that the one contains say two hundred, and the other only one hundred shillings. These pices of money we can see and feel with our senses : atoms, molecules, and the like are on the contrary beyond the range of sensuous perception, and thought alone can decide whether they are admissible and have a meaning. 2. Lenin, Materialism and Empir io-Cr itici sm, p. 245: 'To sever Lngels doctrine of the objective reality of time and space from his doctrine of the transformation of 4 'things-in- themselves" into things for us, from his recognition of objective and absolute truth, viz., the objective reality given us in our sensations, and from his recognition of objective law, causality and necessity in natuje - is to reduce an integral philosophy to an utter jumble. Like all the Machians, Bazarov erred in confounding the mutability of human conceptions of time and space, their exclusively relative character, with the immutability of the fact that man and nature exist only in time and space And a philosophy that denies the objective reality of time and space is as absurd, as intrinsically rotten and false " Ibid., p. 236 : "There is nothing in the world but matter in motion, and matter in motion cannot move otherwise than in space and time. Human conceptions of space and time are relative, but these relative conceptions, in their develop- ment move towards absolute truth and approach nearer and nearer to it. The mutability of human conceptions of space and time no more refutes the objective reality of space and time than the mutability of scientific knowledge of the structure and forms of matter in motion refutes the objective reality of the external world." 3.

Lenin's arguments are twofold. Notwithstanding the relati- vistic and idealistic theories of the scientists people do their work within the framework of space and time." His second argument is more important (and it incidently reveals the political purpose of his book Materialism and Empirio-Criticism ). Lenin thinks that any attempt to destory the absoluteness of space and time would lead to subjective idealism and fìdeism since it would incorporate an element of mentalism and consequently it would destroy the revolutionary urge because it will lead to reliance on human destiny and divine will. But Lenin is not justified in his fears. The 'special theory of relativity' by its fusion of space and time in one unitary concept has succeeded in uniting under a higher point of such concepts as those of mass, energy, gravitation, and inertia and has imparted thereby a perfect symmetrical form to the laws of the conservation of energy and of momentum, and has not produced any subjectivist reactionary theory. No serious conclusions of a socially reactionary and conservative character have been drawn from the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. The study of the relations between the positivist physics of Mach and dialectical materialism reveals some interesting points.* Lenin argued against Mach, Avenarius and Petzoldt because the Russian Machians- Bogdanov, Bazarov, Yushkevich etc.,4 who claimed that the recognition of things-in-themselves in materialism was due to Kantian i.

Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, p. 264 : •• Marxism rejects not what distinguishes one positivist from another, but what is common to both and what makes a philosopher a positivist instead of a materialist And the essence of the matter is the radical difference between materialism and the broad current of positivism, which includes Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Mikhailovsky, a number of neo-Kantians, and Mach and Avenarius. The essence of the matter has been very accurately expressed by Engels in his Ludwig Feuerbach , where he places all the Kantian and Humeans of that period (i. e.t the eighties of the last century) in the camp of wretched eclectics, pettifoggers ( Flohknacker ), and so on." 4.

To Lenin this was an example of confused thinking. It appears to us that the positions of Mach and Marx cannot be reconciled.1 The old positivism had a dogmatic belief in science. The old positivism of Mach advanced in an empirical direction since it accepted the historical evolutionary methodology from Darwin.1 This empirical- evolutionary outlook is similar to the Marxian standpoint. But ontologically, Marxism accepts the fundamental priority of matter. According to Mach matter is only a convenient label for a complex of qualities and hence the Marxian view of matter would be metaphysical according to Mach. Mach proceeded in the direction of neutralism and accepted no sharp cleavage between mind and matter. He hypos- tatised sensorial elements and defined reality as a combination of sensations standing in definite relations to one another.* According to him sensations are not symbols of things but the thing is a mental symbol of. a complex of sensations of merely relative stability. The substantial ego and the material bodies are the result of different combinations of the same elements. Therefore it appears that Lenin's statement about the Machian view of things as complexes of sensations bèing a revival of Berkeleyanism is sound. The reduction of matter to a systematic combination of sensorial elements is bound to lead to a subjective idealism despite Mach's assertion that the true elements of the world are colours, sounds, pressures, spaces and durations and not things. Moreover, there is no denying that the elimination of objectivity from the field of philosophy in the name of positivism is a backward trend in the realm of thought. Recently Phillip Frank has tried to_defend positivism from Marxist attacks.4 According to I. Cf. Plekhanov . Fundamental Problems of Marxism, p. 136 ; «'Ernest Mach and his pupils .... first transform sensation into a self-governing entity independent of the essence of the feeling body, an entity which they term an 'element', and then they go on to say that this entity contains the solution of the contradiction between being and thought, between subject and object. This suffices to show how great is the mistake of those who declare that Mach is akin to Marx." 2. Aliotta, The Idealistic Reaction against Science , Chapter III. 3. Cp. E.

According to Avenarious, "We must then regard the existing as sensation, at the basis of which there is nothing which does not possess sensation." He denied that thought was a function or a product of the brain.4 In so far as Avenarius emphasised the empirical elements of knowlodge, Marxism has nothing to say against him but by his insistence on a psychological sensationalism he wants to deny scientific rationalism. Hence dialectical materialism cannot be reconciled with empirio-criticism because Marx never favoured pure empiricism. The empirio-criticism of Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt and Hodgson reduced intellectual function to a combination of expedients meant to economise mental labour. It looks to immediate experience as the truest revelation of reality and hence carried to ultimate lengths and freed from some implicit contradictions it partially leads to contingency and intuitionism.

Phillipp Frank : Between Physics and Philosophy , p. 149, proposes that to come up to the position of the "Vienna Circle" the diamat will have to give up the three laws of the Hegelian dialectics. Also the diamat will have to forego the description of matter as something existing objectively ( which in the last analysis is idealistic according to Frank ) and speak of intersubjective propositions. Frank in order to bring Marxism nearer to positivism tries to stretch the Marxian criterion of practice to mean that accor- ding to the Marxist a proposition without stating the conditions under which it is applicable is meaningless for science. Evidently Frank is trying to incorporate the ideas of Carnap, Schlick etc. in Marxism. But there is no reason why the discussion of the problem of the nature of reality should be given up for the sake of endless linguistic and semantic jungles . 3.

Dialectical materialism on the contrary tries to combine the immediacy of empirical knowledge with the conceptualistic rationalism of Hegelianism and modern science. Hence epistemologically Marxism and Machism can not be reconciled III Dialectical Materialism and Modern Science Towards the end of the last century physical researches were interpreted in an idealistic fashion by some scientists, and philoso- phers.1 Poincaré* asserted that the electron theory undermined Lavosier's principle or the principle of the conservation of mass. Augusto Righi tried to demonstrate that the electron theory puts electricity in place of matter * HermannCohen - the neo-Kantian idealist, seized upon this electron theory and thought that it had caused the greatest revolution in physics by the transformation of matter into force and had heralded the victory of theoretical idealism since electricity permitted nature to be presented in terms of non- material motion.4 But dialectical materialism asserts that the new researches into the constitution of matter do not negate the materia- listic standpoint but only deepen it. If it could be asserted that Marxism has the same concept of matter as upheld by pre-energetics physics then certainly the new researches would have made the Marxian theory obsolete. Lenin accepts that with the progressive advance of physics properties of matter which had been considered immutable formerly have disappeared but he emphatically asserts that these changes have affected only the structure of matter. The sole claim of dialectical materialism according to him, is that an objective material reality exists outside the mind. Marxism accepts that physics advances from the old concept of matter to atom to electron and will advance further but these researches do not negate the existence of the electron or the ether outside the human mind. According to Engels there is no immutable law in nature except the reflection of an external reality by the human mind. The assertion of the categorical, unconditional existence of nature outside man and human perceptions distinguishes dialectical materialism from agnosti- cism. We think that the arguments of Engels and Lenin are sound I. Edward Hartmann. The Weltanschauug der modernen Physik, Leipzig 1902. 2. Poincaré, The Value of Science , New York, 1907, pp. 102, 104. 3.

But Lenin proceeded to show that the new structural changes did not affect the materialist theory of know- ledge.1 Before we examine the question of the idealistic or materialistic tendencies of modern physics it is necessary to find out the character of scientific theories themselves. We find a subjective conception of science in Ostwald. According to him motion could be conceived without matter. He proposed the subordination of the concepts of spirit and matter to energy. Ostwald says- "That all external events mav be presented by an interaction of energies can be mostly simply explained if our mental processes are themselves energetic and impose this property of theirs on all external phenomena." Besides, this proposal of a subjective conception,* we also find the symbolic theory of science. Hertz tried to show that light and electro-magnetic pheno- mena are associated with the same equations but have different wave lengths. In the opinion of the Machians the fact that Maxwell and Hertz limited their theory to a system of differential equations refuted materialism since there remained no matter, no objective reality but only symbols. Poincaré, Yushkevich4 and Schlick favour a symbolic view of science. Poincaré and Dingier® consider science to be only a symbolic convention for man's convenience. Bergson* and the pragmatists as also Spengler7 to a certain extent emphasise the techni- cal and manipulative character of science. According to the "Vienna circle" physical theories are only rules for representing the results of experiments and are not predicative propositions having cognitional l. Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, p. 317 : "In order to present the the question in the only correct way, that is, from the dialectical materialist standpoint, we must ask : Do electrons, ether and so on exist as objective realities outside the human mind or not ? The scientists will also have to answer this question unhesitatingly; and they do invariably answer it in the affirmative, just as they unhesitatingly recognise that nature existed prir to man and prior to organic matter. Thus, the question is decided in favour of materialism, for the concept matter epistemologicallv implies nothing but objective reality existing independently of the hitman brain and reflected by it." But Lenin does not sufficiently elaborate the implications of this epistemologica! realism 1. A. DeTjorin, Lenin and the Crisis of Modern Physics, Leningrad, 1930. 3. Cp. K.

Marxism, on the other hand, considers that scientific theories make predicative assertions about the external reality.1 The mani- pulative function of science could not lead to the attainment of success unless the physical and chemical theories asserted something definite about the universe. Any subjectivist interpretation of science is bound to lead ultimately either to idealism or to scepticism. Hence Marxism tries to bridge the gulf between science and the universe by emphasising the value of the physical and chemical experiments in dealing with something objective and external. It is interesting to mention in this connection the "hieroglyphic" theory of Plekhanov and Axelrod. Plekhanov was influenced by Sechenov and Helmholtz. Arguing from the relativity of our visual perception Helmholtz considered that the object in our consciousness did not represent the object in itself but was only a hieroglyph or a symbol.* But this reduction of knowledge to a symbol cannot be substantiated in face of the immense concreteness and vastness of modern physical achievements in practical technology. It cannot be denied that the symbolic or conventional interpretations of scientific theories imply a distrust of the sense-perceptions and thereby destroy the further progress of knowledge. If science is only symbolical it cannot reflect the qualitative richness of nature, argues Mitin, the Soviet thinker. Hence the progress of knowledge is dependent on science being considered an objective theoretical presentation of reality. i . According to Marxism the 'subjective dialectic* or the reflection in human consciousness is identical with the 'objective dialectic* or the way in which external nature moves and acts. Engels in Ludwig Feuerbach ( Selected Works of Marx) American edition, Vol. I, p. 431), says : "But the question of the relation of thinking and being has yet another side : in what relation do our thoughts about the world surrounding us stand to this world itself ? Is our thinking capable of the cognition of the real world ? Are we able in our ideas and notions of the real world to produce a correct reflection of reality ? In philosophical language this question is called the question of the 'identity of thinking and being' and the overwhelming majority of philosophers give an affirmative answer to this question." But I think that Marx and Engels do not offer any proofs for this identification of thinking and being except the rather superficial concept of practice which is regarded as the criterion of truth. See also Otto Neurath, Foundations of the Social Sciences, pp. 19, 48 (footnote no. 28), for comments on the scientific physicalist approach of Marx and Engels. 2. Faced with the criticism of the Bolsheviks Plekhanov said that the term hieroglyph was being abused but he continued to adhere to the theory of correspon- dence. Marxists think that the correspondence theory establishes Kantianism in place of materialism. Axelrod appealed to the "symbolic" theory in modern science in defence of the hieroglyphic theory against Lenin's criticism. 3. H. Helmholtz, Handbook of Physiological Optics . p. 440 ff, Lectures and Speeches Vol. 2, pp. 224 if.</page><page sequence="18">2I8 VISHWANATH PRASAD VARMA The materialistic philosophy of Marx and Engels does require some vital modifications and reformulation in the light of recent achievements in physics.1 But the notion of an objective material reality constantly in motion which is so greatly stressed upon by Marxism is still accepted by science in a general sense.2 Some recent physicists wanted to raise the issue of idealism in physics. Bernhard Bavink challenges the mechanical conception of science in the name of the organismic conception. Marxism also reacts against the mechanical conception but it will not accept the conclusion of Bavink that science once more has been tied up with God, soul and freedom of the will. James Jeans argues for a mathematical conception of nature. He thinks that the mechanical materialistic Newtonian physics has been replaced by the mathematical idealistic Einsteinian physics.8 God was considered as an engineer in the older theory but Jeans thinks that modern physics brings forward the motion of God as a mathematician, I think that one of the reasons as to why these idealistic religious conclusions have been put forward is a confusion of thinking between arguing for idealism on the basis of scientific theory and arguing for idealism from the limitations of science. It is possible to argue for a super-scientific existence on the grounds of mystic experience. Science has a certain limited field of enquiry and it confines its researches to that. Max Planck, for example, would not agree with the Marxian dogmatism that science claims to reveal everything.4 If somebody tries to supplement the physical researches of science by his private intuitions regarding supra-scientific entities it may be done. But the religious mystics are completely mistaken if they want to claim an objective universal certainty for their indivi- dual intuitions. Religious experience has profound emotional values of a subjective character but it cannot claim cognitional predicative character. But this kind of argument is utterly different from the I. According to Engels the development of western science and philosophy pointed out that the unity of the world eonsists not in its being but in its materiality Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there been nor can be matter without motion. But in the light of recent scientific knowledge we have to say that the notion of immutable matter-stuff is now replaced by the view of a complicated system of dynamic pulsating energy. 2. Although German phenomenologists, French positivists and British empiricists show a great antipathy to the notion of substance, still it is correct to say that modern science accepts an external reality, outside and independent of the human mind. 3.

This latter view seems like an infiltration of the animistic anthropomorphic concepts of the pre-Renaissance science. Some scientists try to argue that the implications of relativity theory have rendered obsolete some of the notions of classical physics on which dialectical materialism is largely based. It is said that in Einstein's theory the 'length of a rod' or the 'time interval between X and y' does not refer to objective facts but has a meaning only in relation to the observer. Hence it is concluded that once again Barkeleyan subjectivism against which Lenin fought so passionately reigns in physics. But in defence of Marxism we will point out that the emphasis on the role of the observer in the theory of Relativity does not mean the assertion of a creative subjective determinant of objective facts. The observer certainly does not create any difference between things, he only confirms the results which could have been achieved by the use of any measuring instrument. The distinction between the subjective and the objective is not negated by the recent developments in physics and the equations established by the theory of relativity are in no case determined by subjective positions. Dialectical materialism received the belief in causation and determinism from Hegel.1 Some recent scientists think that physics does not accept causation or determinism. Determinism is a part of the broader problem of causation,8 since if there is in the Tiniverse the operation of immanental objective scientific laws then this is bound to result in cosmic and subjective determinism. Positivist i. Marx was inspired by the materialism of Epicurus but the influence of Hegelian determinism was too strong on him and hence he condemned the Epicurean doctrine of chance in his doctoral dissertation. But Marshall, Industry and Trade , 1919. PP* 176- 177, is mistaken in attributing to Marx, fatalistic conclusions. Some students of Marx point out that since the latter stressed political vital actionism and revolutionary voluntarism, Marxism should not be regarded as a deterministic philosophy. But to Marx's mind there was no contradiction between cosmic determinism and social- historical actionism. If one studies Marxism in details and philosophically he will find out that the basic and fundamental category in Marx is not the freedom of subjective action but ' the operative mechanism of objective forces. If one studies the history of the dialectical ¿ philosophy from Plato to Hegel , the conviction dawns on the mind that the constancy of dialectical motion in nature and society can only be a necessary outcome of fundamental determinism. Marx was a materialist, but the methodological process of the dialectic is similar in him and in Hegel. 2.

But Marxism inherits from Hegelianism the belief in the rational character of the universe and it believes in the operation of laws in the realms of nature and society. It is asserted by some scientists that the old concept of determinism has been completely given up, and hence nature is indeterminate. According to Jeans the Heisen^ergian 'principle of uncertainty' shows that nature abhors accuiacy and precision. But this is an extreme statement of the case. This 'principle of uncertainty' certainly challenges the mecha- nical conception of the universe. According to some thinkers this principle shows that the basis of quantum laws is statistical and so the notion of causal laws cannot be applied. But Max Planck thinks that the constant aim of physics must be to reduce particular statisti- cal laws into general dynamic laws3 and if we accept this view we once more approximate to Kant who tried to challenge Hume's reduction of causality to psychological custom, in the interests of science. "Granted that, in a given case, the initial conditions are determined as precisely as the Principle of Uncertainty permits, then the probability of all subsequent states is determined by exact laws. Given that the experiment is repeated a great many times, then it is possible to predict both the frequency of occurrence of the expected effects and the deviations from these effects. There is nothing lawless in quantum phenomena " 8 It is true that events and phenomena are to some extent indeterminate but this does not amount to the assertion of the operation of spontaneous irrationality in nature. Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty only implies that the complicated character of natural facts cannot be completely determined and revealed by the mechanism of physical measurement, howsoever refined and accurate. But Heisenberg's theories can never be taken to imply the absurd view of the reign of indeterminism. Hence the basic conceptions of Marxism about causation and determinism still hold. I. Cp.

The dialectical maternalism of Marx, Engels and Lenin was not primarily constructed or perfected as a scientific or philosophic theory. It has been accepted by them mainly in the interests of social revolution.1 They noticed the reactionary and conservative character of the German idealistic philosophy 1 Marx thought that only the acceptance of a materialistic philosophy could shatter the theological outcome of an idealist philosophy. No doubt it is a historical fact that oftentimes idealism has been used by interested groups to sup- port political and social autocracy. But instances to the contrary can also be found. Some of the most important leaders of the Italian, Irish and Indian liberation movement have been idealist. Dialectical materialism can defend itself against those scientists and philosophers who talk loosely of the idealistic and subjective nature of modern physics or of the crisis in physics. It is still valid to hold that, in a broad sense at least, science does not destroy the concept of an objective material reality in motion. But I do not accept the Marxist claim that dialectical materialism is a complete philosophy of life t nature and society. In spite of the scientific attempts of dialectical materialism to analyse nature and society I still feel that an enigmatic spiritual strain surrounds human personality .* But acceptance of any kind of idealism i. Certainly Marxism is a defiant materialistic creed in the sense that it accepts the birth of consciousness from the qualitative movements of primal matter. But still Marx and Engels were not speculative philosophers and scientist seriously engaged in analysing the nature of matter, motion and energy. It appears from A nti-Duhring and Dialectics of Nature that Engels had more genuine interests in philosophy and science than Marx although the latter had a doctor's degree in philosophy. Except for his doctoral dissertation, the only book where Marx discusses philosophical problems is The Holy Family. Marx's interests primarily were in the fields of social and political philosophy and economic theory. The main aim of Marx was to provide a programme and theory of revolution to the proletariat in its historic fight against the bourgeoise. 2. Lenin is distrustful of all types of idealism because they indirectly prepare the ground for religious superstitions of a disgusting kind. He says : ''The idealist phi- losophers have always sought to change this latter name (i. e. God) Absolute idea, universal spirit, world-will ..... are different formulations of one and the same idea." Evidently the revolutionary Lenin had no realization of the depths and pro- fundities of the religious experience. 3. Due to the exaggerated dominance of scientism, objectivism and positivism there is the tendency in modern thought to regard the historical and the existential as the centre of attention. Since the seventeenth century we find a progressive going away from the notion of the sacrosanct character of the human personality. Both capitalism and Marxism suffer from the failure to stress the supteme value of the human spirit. In its craze for objectivization and rationalization Marxism has genera- (Contd. on page 222)</page><page sequence="22">222 VISHWANATH PRASAD VARMA in philosophy, aesthetics or psychology is not a hindrance either to a rigid naturalistic scientific analysis of social causation or to an accep- tance of the efficacy of revolutionary action for changing the irrational structure of any society. I myself used to be a Vedantist some years ago. This much seems to be true to me that any big political and economic trans- formation is not possible in India unless Vedantic and Buddhistic ethical idealism is concretized in social life on a great scale. I agree with the Marxists in their contention that most often idealistic philosophies and religions are exploited by the ruling group. In the industrialized countries of the West, a Faustian materialism (to use Spengler's terms), mathematically calculating the behaviour of nature for controlling it, is prevailing. If Hindus think along with Upanishads and Sankara that the whole phenomenal world is merely illusion and the only ultimate reality is Brahman, they cannot compete successfully with other nations. The idealists will reply to me that not materialist socialists and communists have brought independence to India but the idealistic Tilak and Gandhi. I grant it, but still think that even if in private behaviour and personal beliefs we are very idealistic and transcendentalistic, as citizens we have to be serious about matter and nature. In Hindu philosophy God is the lord of matter (*TOt § SÇfá fèrfàmfav g ) Every Hindu as Vivekananda said, now must thus try to become a God &lt;£f &lt;^q#) and control nature. This Vedantic sociological conception will represent the real and the highest synthesis of the Upanishads, German idealism and Marxian social and economic philosophy. Such a broad synthesis and not one-sided exaggeration is the need of the hour. (Cont. page 221) ted a new illusion : The illusion of the superiority of the social revolutionary con- sciousness. Marxism has tried to divest the human being of any spiritual soul and intuitional consciousness. It has enshrined a new fetishism, the fetishism of the proletariat. Hence what we need to-day is a renaissance of spiritual values. Only a supreme dedication to the values of the spirit will save humanity from immersion into the impending catastrophe. Therefore we need a synthesis of modern democratic socialism and the ancient values of the supremacy of the human person advocated by Vedantism and Buddhism. Marxian materialism, on the other hand, devalues the great creations of art, philosophy, religion and ethtics by interpreting them only as the superstructures corresponding to changing relations of production.
