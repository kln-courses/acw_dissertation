<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. RICHARD COMSTOCK THEOLOGY AFTER THE "DEATH OF GOD" A Survey of Recent Trends in Religious Thought Recently a number of American theologians have written books and articles in which reference to the "death of God" plays a prominent part. One of them asserts that "we must live the death of God if we are to exist in our world, for the confession of the death of God is now the price of the Christian's contemporaneity." Another examines "the difficulty of finding any meaningful way to speak of God." A third declares that "the death of God is a public event in our history." Such language is startling. It is true that in poetry and novels the theme of "God's death" has been expressed for some time. Tolstoy describes the anguish of the dying Ivan Ilyitch over the absence of God. Ε. E. Cummings notes that with "Jehovah buried," "Eternity is now a Five Year Plan." Kafka writes a haunting parable on the death of the "Imperial Emperor" who has sent his courier forth with a mes sage—a message that is meaningless because of the sender's demise. Ingmar Bergman broods on the "silence of God" in many of his films. Yet it is easier for a poet than a theologian to make such references. Paul van Buren makes the interesting point that astronomy has excised the alien elements of astrology from its concern and chemistry has done the same with alchemy. He suggests that theology embark on a similar program in regard to its traditional references to God. Yet a glaring difference is obvious. Astronomy and chemistry have freed them selves from entanglement with matters foreign to their own fields. But could astronomy eliminate all reference to astral bodies and chemistry all reference to chemicals without destroying the integrity of their re spective areas of investigation? Similarly, is a theology possible without reference to theos, the divine, God? Etymology, however, should not be allowed to decide the issue. Crea tive exploration in religion has almost always been expressed in the form of radical negations that contained underlying affirmations. Thus the Taoist attacked the Confucian emphasis on the cultivation of moral integrity by affirming that "when the Great Tao ceased to observe, Dr. W. Richard Comstock is Assistant Professor, Department of Religious Stud ies, University of California, Santa Barbara. His articles have appeared in Union Seminary Quarterly Review, Journal of Religion, and International Philosophical Quarterly.</page><page sequence="2">benevolence and righteousness came into vogue." Gautama Buddha ex plored the possibility of attaining the Hindu goal of deliverance by means of a rejection of the two fundamental categories of Hindu thought—Brahman and Atman. Many passages in the writings of the Hebrew prophets seem a violent attack on a priestly religion with whose orientation they have important affinities. The early Christians were called atheists by their contemporaries. Similarly, the present use of extreme negations may actually be evidence of a creative ferment that is taking place in contemporary religious thought. If so, the negations are the one factor that brings together in dia logue otherwise very different theological approaches. At the moment, no set of common presuppositions are the basis of a distinctive "death of God" school. Only T. J. J. Altizer and William Hamilton use the phrase with continued enthusiasm, and very different outlooks seem to be emerging from their respective applications of it to current problems. In addition, many of these writers are profoundly influenced by the prison letters of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and his references to a "religionless Christianity." Thus they are really more concerned with the "death" of religion as a world view than with the "death of God." Furthermore, the methods of these new thinkers are dissimilar. Van Buren uses the techniques of linguistic analysis to discover the rules by which a religious-Christian language may operate without the use of the referent "God." Altizer, on the other hand, thinks in terms of a phenomenological history of religion, seeing man's consciousness de veloping from an archaic sacred form to a modern secular one. Gabriel Vahanian is a cultural critic of the modern post-Christian age. Harvey Cox is a social analyst of the secular form and style of urban life. It is likely that a situation similar to that which occurred in the thirties will repeat itself. At that time, it was common to identify the thought of Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann, Paul Tillich, and Reinhold Niebuhr as "neo-orthodox." Further developments disclosed that differences more significant than their similarities made the title, considered as the desig nation of a single school, misleading. In analogous fashion it is probable that the further work of these younger theologians will sharply diverge into contrasting positions, since the seeds of such differences are al ready present in their most recent discussions. In the present essay, I offer a survey of the major themes present in the discussion of these new thinkers concerned with the death of God or of religion. However, their observations are part of a broader pattern of thought that includes many famous twentieth century theolo gians, philosophers, and mystics. To discern the main features of this pattern, the phrase "death of God" is suggestive and useful as an "ele ment" whereby the basic aspects can be discerned in "solution." Con sequently, an examination of the catalytic function of this striking image in the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche is one helpful method in 266 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="3">distinguishing the shape of current issues; for although he did not first invent the phrase, he is clearly responsible for its widespread use in the twentieth century. A survey of its meaning in his philosophy will enable us to consider more profitably its implications for the contemporary stage of theological exploration. Nietzsche's Challenge In 1882 Nietzsche published The Gay Science, in which he included a striking parable about a "madman" who on a bright morning lights a lantern and runs to the market-place where he calls out unceasingly: "I seek Godl I seek God!" In response to the mockery of his audience, the madman declares, "Where is God gone? ... I mean to tell you! We have killed him . . . The holiest and the mightiest that the world has hitherto possessed, has bled to death under our knife . . . There never was a greater event,—and on account of it, all who are born after us belong to higher history than any history hitherto!"1 In the works that follow The Gay Science, Nietzsche undertakes the task of formulat ing a new kind of thought that has appropriated the full implications of this radical declaration. At first glance the importance of Nietzsche's effort may elude us. Atheism is not his personal discovery, nor does he offer a cogent intel lectual attack on traditional theism that displays the technical bril liance of a Hume or Kant. Thus it cannot be said that Nietzsche's works are in any sense a determining "cause" of the rising tide of theistic unbelief in Europe. As Camus observes: "Nietzsche did not form a project to kill God. He found him dead in the souls of his contemporaries." Twentieth century poets and thinkers did not become concerned about the "death of God" only because of what Nietzsche wrote. Rather, already acquainted with the experience of radical theistic doubt, they found in Nietsche's parable a vehicle for the distinctive expression and recognition of their own feelings and thoughts. Nietzsche's contribution coincides with the task of both poet and philosopher. His imagination reveals synthetic powers of unification whereby divergent themes are fused through concrete imagery. Am biguous, complex, multi-significant meanings are merged into single compelling aphorisms, striking parables and overwhelming visions. Thus the "God" whose death Nietzsche proclaims is a symbolic vehicle through which the dissolution and destruction of a number of related view points that have been important in the history of western man is proclaimed. First, this "God" is essentially related to an "other world", whether considered as a metaphysical world above the physical one, or a super natural one above the natural one. "I beseech you, my brothers, re main faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 267</page><page sequence="4">of other-worldly hopes! . . . Once the sin against God was the greatest sin; but God died . . . To sin against the earth is now the most dread ful thing . . Second, he is a moral God who has a will by which good and evil are determined and the ultimate meaning of existence is discovered. "To look upon nature as if it were a proof of the goodness and care of a God; to interpret history in honor of a divine reason, as a con stant testimony to a moral order in the world and a moral final pur pose ... as if everything were a dispensation, an intimation of Provi dence, something planned and sent on behalf of the salvation of the goal: all that is now past . . ." Third, he is fixed in a static eternity without change. "Evil I call it and misanthropic ... all this teaching of the One and the Plenum and the Unmoved and the Permanent. All the permanent . . . that is only a parable. And the poets lie too much. It is of time and becoming that the best parables should speak. Let them be a praise and a justi fication of all impermanence." Fourth, this God destroys human creativity. The static perfection of this omniscient omni-observer freezes the free becoming of the future into a determined dead fate. Man is solidified into an ugly object that "is" what this God has seen. Man's creativity and capacity for dynamic growth is thus destroyed by the fixed gaze of this eternal "look." "I feel only my will's joy in begetting and becoming . . . away from God and gods this will has lured me. What could one create if gods ex isted? . . . The God who saw everything, even man— this God had to die. Man cannot bear it that such a witness should live . . ." Fifth, the Christian God is a God of "pity"; but pity encourages slackness of energy, weakness, a diminution of the power to affirm ex istence. "Most recently I heard this; God is dead; God died of his pity for man." Finally, this God claims the prerogative of "mystery." He is not avail able to the scrutiny of human reason. "God is a conjecture; but I de sire that your conjectures should be limited by what is thinkable. Could you think a God?"2 Where did this image of the divine originate? Clearly, three sources have contributed to its formation in western culture. First is the Lord proclaimed in the Bible, the One with the creative power to bring the world into being, a deity with a Holy Will for Israel and all man kind, a living God with purposes and plans. Second is the meta physical schema of the Greeks, whereby the world is seen as an hier archial cosmos centered around a single over-arching principle called the Good (Plato), or the eternal, immutable Substance that is the object of aspiration of all beings (Aristotle). A third source is even more important. Scholars like Durkheim and Eliade find in the primi tive distinctions made in all cultures between the sacred and profane, 268 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="5">between the holy and the secular, between numinous reality and mun dane phenomena the very heart of religion. Otto described the experi ence of the holy as containing a sense of power and being {tremendum) that is mysterious, uncanny (mysterium), and possessing overwhelming value (jascinans). Eliade argues that it is through the fundamental ex perience of the sacred that primitive man understood his world to be a cosmos rather than a chaos. Its appearance provided man with "the fixed point, the central axis for all future orientation"; around this holy center one could organize the heterogeneous experiences of his existence into a meaningful whole possessing order, integrity, coher ence.3 Thus the God of western Christendom has been the moral, meta physical and sacred point of unity, whereby man's cosmos revealed its meaning, importance, and ultimate value. The "death" of this God means not only the end of belief in a certain anthropomorphic deity, but, more important, the death of all the functions that he performed for western man. With Him goes the sense of a transcendent and ulti mate norm for the value of this world, of a final purpose and a single meaning which could serve as a focus for human aspiration. With Him goes the religious aspect, the metaphysical structure, the sacred dimension of existence. If it is Nietzsche's purpose to announce mankind's freedom from religion, metaphysics, and the sacred,4 an intriguing question may be raised about his choice of a mythic form in which to state his mean ing. Nietzsche does not argue that the God hypothesis is logically un tenable and without experimental verification. He refers to the murder of God under the knife of man. This is the archaic language of ancient poetry, religion, ritual; the language of dramatic event and concrete happening that occurs within a grand context of numinous emotion. Such myths have in the past been a primary vehicle for religious ex pression. They are intimately connected with the sense of the holy and have been used to describe "the various and sometimes dramatic irruptions of the sacred into the world."5 Why should an image fraught with such overtones and memories be used in the present context? In The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche expresses his sense of the im portance of myth, without which "evefy culture loses its healthy creative natural power." He calls myth the "concentrated picture of the world," and declares that it "gives meaning" to man's "life and struggles."® However, this is an early work and Jaspers observes that "in his youth, Nietzsche as a classical philologist often spoke of myths, but in his later life he seldom so much as used the word."7 Although he con tinues to make use of a kind of mythic thinking in his references to Zarathustra and Dionysius, the fact remains that the basic categories of his mature thought are formed with the intent of freeing man from bondage to the dogmatic perspectives usually connected with myth. W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 269</page><page sequence="6">Why then is atheism here proclaimed in the mythic form of dramatic event? It must indicate that Nietzsche is experiencing in his own con sciousness a transition from a religious-sacred sensibility to a secular profane one that he considers representative of a movement in mankind as a whole. Nietzsche knows that ancient man has been religious man who has organized his world view around the distinction between the sacred and the profane. If modern and post-modern man as the heirs of this Weltanschauung are to be truly free of it, the liberation must be decisive and definite. Simply to ignore the sacred by using lan guages of logic and science which are oblivious to it is not sufficient. The "power" must be truly "broken" and this requires that the modern sensibility enter one last time into the domain of the sacred through mythic language, there to commit one final act of violence. The exist ence of the sacred God will not be coldly denied by a calculation of logic. Rather, man as culture-hero must "murder" the deity and thus exorcise his numinous power. "The holiest and the mightiest that the world has hitherto seen" must bleed to death under man's knife within the context of a religious emotion that is uncanny, fearful, full of awe. The earth seems to be "loosened" from the sun and man plunges into an "infinite nothingness" where the night comes on "continually darker and darker." Thus atheism uses myth to destroy myth. The culture hero has performed his supreme act: the murder of God that brings to man a frightful gift, unlimited freedom and unbounded creativity. The price paid for this last use of myth is an ambiguity of meaning pervading the pronouncement. Can the "death of God" refer to an ontic event? Does it mean that once there existed in the realm of beings an entity Who was Supremely Powerful, but who has at some point in the present time ceased to exist? Is man consequently bereft and "aban doned"? Such an interpretation is "fantastic", yet great myths are able to infuse their images with the sense of ontic reality that is difficult to resist while under their spell. Yet since the time when Greek philosophy broke free of the power of myth through the use of logos (reason), the acceptance of myth in such a literal and primitive manner has not been possible for large numbers of people. Just as Rudolf Bultmann recommends a program for the de-mythologization of Christian myths, so Nietzsche suggests the manner in which his own myth may be de-mythologized. This is done by considering the "death of God" as an event taking place in the realms of man's linguistic activity and of his corresponding states of sconsciousness. On this view "God" is a symbol. The event of God's death refers to the fact that for modern man the symbol "God" has lost its vitality and functionality in the storehouse of his semantic tools. It has ceased to convey religious power and denotative significance. The sign has become meaningless; the symbol is dead. Even closer to Nietzsche's central meaning is the shifting of the 270 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 196*</page><page sequence="7">focus from either an ontic reality or a symbol that has "died" to the human consciousness in which the death takes place. In this third in terpretation, the "death" refers to the death of belief, to an emerging state of human awareness in which reference to a transcendent realm of value and meaning is excluded. Once man saw his world as irradiated by a divine presence that was the center of power, purpose, ultimate concern. Now he sees his world as a profane landscape that at no point discloses the irruption of the sacred into its secular existence. Such an emphasis is the dominant one in Nietzsche's mind. The "death of God," he makes clear, means that "the Christian God has become unworthy of belief." The "event" is the "decay of belief in the Chris tian God, the victory of scientific atheism." Formerly, "all events were of a different lustre, for a God shone forth in them."8 Now man turns to an earth in perpetual process without design, purpose, or sacred axis. Susanne Langer observes that the ultimate end of a good myth is "not wishful distortion of the world, but serious envisagement of its fundamental truths; moral orientation, not escape."9 To Nietzsche, the symbol "God" stands for a certain kind of broad orientation toward the world, a symbolic form of consciousness. The "death" of God points to a fundamental change in perspective, the occurrence of a radical event. Something has happened, is happening, if not to the Divine Life, then in the history of human consciousness. The basic presupposition of this myth is that man is not a static being whose nature and forms of apprehension are immutably fixed by either God or Nature. He is an historical consciousness, ever in process, who is presently undergoing a transformation from religious man into secu lar man. On this point the varying historical accounts of Hegel, Cassirer, Eliade and Heidegger concerning transformations in human conscious ness are all pertinent. Furthermore, the hysterical and melodramatic violence implicit in the phrase "death of God" should not cause the religious heart and the theistic mind to miss the profound respect for the symbol "God" that is communicated in Nietzsche's attack on it. He observes: "attack ing is to me a proof of good-will and, in certain respects, of gratitude. By means of it, I honor a thing, I distinguish a thing."10 To Nietzsche, "God" is "the holiest and mightiest that the world has hitherto pos sessed." A transformation in consciousness that eliminates this sacred focus of concern is thus a tremendously significant phenomenological event that requires the most serious consideration. His myth reveals an appreciation of the importance of the religious stance far different from the careless neglect of thinkers incapable of his extreme imagery and expression. Of course, many of the features of his description and the implica tions he draws from it can be challenged. Myth has no claim to in fallibility. It functions as a creative focus to our attention; it cannot W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 271</page><page sequence="8">determine that what is finally seen by others shall be identical with the vision of the original myth-maker. Myth should be used, not as inerrant revelation, but as a heuristic tool for exploration. Thus two sugges tions implicit in Nietzsche's myth must be resisted. One is a determinis tic view of the inevitability of this or any historical process. The ap pearance and apparent direction of a movement of consciousness does not mean that its final shape has already been decided. Second is an over-confidence in our ability as phenomenological observers to com prehend immediately every aspect and nuance of the event in process. The shape, extent, and ultimate import of the emerging secularism are not yet completely clear. Two questions remain: Is Nietzsche's myth really a description? Or is it rather a prescription of what he thinks could happen and ought to happen? Nietzsche's madman decides that "prodigious event is still on its way" for "the light of the stars needs time, even after they are done, to be seen and heard." And Nietzsche observes that "God is dead: but as the human race is constituted . . . for milleniums yet . . . people will show his shadow.—And we—we have still to overcome his shadow!"11 It would seem that both descriptive and prescriptive elements are present in Nietzsche's symbol. The event of an emergent, dominant secularity has not yet occurred in mankind as a whole; but it has taken place in the minds of many philosophers, poets, and cultural leaders, as well as large portions of the general populace. Many con temporary theologians have discovered its presence within their own sensibilities, although not in the radical shape described by Nietzsche. For these reasons the phenomenon that he announces requires atten tion, exploration, interpretation. In the remainder of this essay, some of the theological and anti-theological positions that the catalytic po tentialities of this myth have released are considered. The Death of Religion To Nietzsche the death of God means the elimination of far more than a particular anthropomorphic deity. To him, "God" is the drama tic symbol for a world view that is oriented toward an "other world" in which resides a static perfection that, already complete, deprives the becoming process of this world of its importance and creativity. The emerging consciousness of contemporary man is one that has a predominantly "this worldly" focus. The existence of an "other world" is either directly denied or, at least, the priority of emphasis is placed on the problems and needs of this world as the locus of proper con cern. The excitement aroused by John Robinson's Honest to God has centered on his forceful recognition of the presence in modern theology of this shift in perspective. Hence much criticism of this widely read 272 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 19M</page><page sequence="9">tract has been beside the point. It has been accused of a lack of orig inality, but Robinson's purpose is simply to describe an existing con gruence of "this worldly" orientation that has appeared both in technical theology and in popular religious attitudes. Furthermore, the criticism that he tries to synthesize the positions of very heterogeneous thinkers misses the mark, since his point is not that they reveal an identity in the details of their analyses, but that they agree on this central matter. The three theologians whom he chooses as examples—Rudolf Bultmann, Paul Tillich and Dietrich Bonhoeffer—clearly substantiate his thesis. Bultmann has urged that Biblical theologians undertake the task of "demythologizing" the mythic world view found in the New Testa ment, with its three-storied structures comprising the earth at the center, heaven above, and an underworld below. He argues that the gospel message (kerygma) of the New Testament must be separated from such spatial models of divine transcendence. Tillich acknowledges his affinities with a naturalism that has abandoned ontological dualisms between nature and super-nature. He rejects the notion of a metaphysics that deals with "transempirical realities, with a world behind the world, existing only in speculative imagination,"12 and attempts to construct a theological interpretation of the one world of human experience. In his famous prison letters, Bonhoeffer explores this theme in a manner that has been suggestive and extremely influential on the most recent stages of the discussion. Although the phrase "death of God" is not prominent in his work, so many of his points approximate Nietzsche's vision that we are not surprised to learn that Bonhoeffer was an enthusiastic reader of Nietzsche in his youth.13 Bonhoeffer pre fers to speak of the demise of metaphysics and of religion in a world that is now understood without the necessity of reference to an "other worldly" God. The world has clearly "come of age" and, in reaching its "adulthood," has become secular and "this worldly." Bonhoeffer's purpose, then, is to consider the possibility of exploring a "religion less" Christianity.14 What does Bonhoeffer mean by the demise of "religion"? Although exactness of definition cannot be found in the tentative suggestions of his letters, several basic characteristics of what he means by religion do emerge. First, religion shares with metaphysics the orientation to ward an "other world." Second, it cultivates an inward or individu alistic search for a salvation from this world and a retreat into an "other worldly" religious realm. Third, religion posits a special sphere of holy ritual, private prayers, and monastic retirement within the world that is somehow considered to be more important than the mundane tasks of everyday life. Fourth, religion uses the God of this other world as a deus ex machina; as an illicit problem-solver. Bonhoeffer points to the seculariz ing process that iSas occurred in all the sciences whereby God is no W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 273</page><page sequence="10">longer used as a hypothesis to explain any of the facts of physics or biology. He suggests that theology has made one final effort to find a use for God in the realm of psychology and existential analysis. There it is argued that man in his anxiety and guilt still needs the tran scendent God to assist him. But Bonhoeffer suggests that even here the process of secularization is taking place, and that profane man is finding "this worldly" resources with which to cope with fear and death. Related to this fourth point is a final observation: that religion holds to the "premise" that there is some kind of a priori need in man by which he hungers after the divine reality. On this view, man is homo religiosus and finds in the structure of his nature some point of contact with God, at least in the form of a feeling of aspiration toward Him. But if such man ever existed, it now appears that he was a transitory historical phenomenon; modern man has become profane man who is religionless—i.e., devoid of this a priori premise.15 There are important points of congruent emphasis between Nietzsche's "death of God" and Bonhoeffer's "religionless Christianity." Both pro claim the importance of the phenomenon of secularism for modern thought and both identify this phenomenon with the abandonment of metaphysics and religion. Nietzsche's anti-metaphysical stance is a stri dent articulation of an attitude held by many modern philosophers and secular thinkers.16 Bonhoeffer's formulation, in turn, describes an attempt among Biblical theologians to extricate an authentic Biblical view from the "other worldly" forms of thought that have been so widely rejected and thus to show the continued relevance of Biblical faith to the modern mind. Here we might accuse such theologians of a certain lack of gallantry. In seeking to elude Nietzsche's hostile knife, they are willing to allow it to plunge into the heart of the metaphysical enterprise without regret. They somehow hope that if theology can be separated from a fatally wounded metaphysics and religion, it will be ^ invulnerable to the death blow aimed at them all. In the present survey the substantive issues raised by Nietzsche and Bonhoeffer are accepted as important, but the restricted connotation given to "metaphysics" and "religion" is not adopted, because it gen erates more confusion than clarity. In the twentieth century, it has be come clear that although some metaphysical and religious systems have been connected with an "other worldly" perspective, metaphysics and religion are not thereby essentially and inevitably associated with radical dualisms. Nietzsche's dictum that it is "of time and becoming that the best parables should speak" has actually become the key insight of contemporary ontology and metaphysics. There are three reasons why the secular suspicion of metaphysics is without foundation. First, major examples of twentieth century ontology have demonstrated an orienta tion toward this world. Phenomenology and existentialism have con verged on the attempt to disclose the basic structures of our present 274 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="11">human existence. American thinkers like James, Santayana and Dewey, while rejecting an "other worldly" metaphysics, produced naturalistic ontologies of their own, and Alfred North Whitehead has developed a "speculative philosophy" that is a "system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted."17 Second, these "systems" are not fixed and static schemes that are oblivious to history, process, and creative advance. On the contrary, they provide general categories in which the sense of pluralistic diver sity and openness to future growth can be conceptually expressed. Third, these general concepts are not "non-empirical" but, on the contrary, are directed toward the description of "every element of our experi ence" (Whitehead). Neither can "religion" be simply identified with radical dualisms and with the attempt to "use" a Holy Reality to solve mundane prob lems. The latter could as well be called "magic" as "religion"; the former has been prevalent in many religious systems, but so has an alternative emphasis upon "this world" as the locus of concern. To be sure, Bonhoeffer has a right to his own definition of "religion," but such a restricted understanding of the term does violence to the historical usage which has been broader and included both supernatural and non-supernatural forms of belief. If "religion" is restricted to world views with radical dualisms, then some other term is still needed to indicate all those life orientations, whether dualistic or not, that have a point of ultimate and absolute focus for their devotional and ethical strivings in which inheres the sense of holy and sacred value. We will employ the term "religion" in this broader sense, unless the context indicates the more narrow usage adhered to by Bonhoeffer and his followers. To sharpen the substantive issue behind these semantic differences, it is helpful to consider some distinctions among the three basic terms mundane, secular, profane. All three first appear on the historical scene in a religious context where they are used to express a fundamental contrast between this world (mundane) and another world; this time (secular) and a time of holy consummation; or ordinary reality (pro fane) and the sacred reality of absolute majesty and value. Thus the adjective mundane conveys a spatial and substantial connotation. Its present use expresses the conviction of modern man that there is only one world of space and time, with no second world either spatially "above" or metaphysically "beyond" it (Robinson). Since the adjec tive secular has a predominantly temporal connotation (this age), it may be used to articulate the conviction that if no final meaning to this world can be found in an other world, neither can it be found in some other time. The "worldly" present flows into a "worldly" future with no holy consummation to give meaning to the process as a whole. Thus, finally, world and time alike are profane. Within the units of W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 27·</page><page sequence="12">mundane space and the moments of secular time appears no point of sacred orientation and ultimate focus to the aspirations of human exist ence. This last point is the crucial one. The importance of an "other world" or a time of consummation resides in the sacred aura that is attached to it. Deprived of holy value, a world of metaphysical forms, of substantial spirits, or even of an omnipotent deity, becomes simply an extension of the one world of all mundane and profane phenomena. The emphasis upon "this world" (mundane) and "this time" (secular) is a way of expressing the conviction that all terms of discourse must now exhibit basic continuities with each other and with the funda mental locus of human experience where meanings are determined and verified. The "event" of modern secularity is basically a decision to relate all thought, discourse, and action in a radical manner to this common "world" of man's mundane experience. The question that remains is whether the entities of mundane space and the moments of secular time comprise a totally profane nexus without the presence of any ultimate focus to give a sacred significance to the course of human life. To answer this question a further inter pretation of mundane secularism is required. One possibility advanced by Nietzsche might be called a "secular interpretation of secularism." Here is developed a view of a mundane world that is totally profanized in every respect. In contrast, we may also note a "religious interpreta tion of secularism" in which a holy center is still recognized in the "depth" of secular phenomena. Such is the position of Paul Tillich. By insisting on the "death" of religion, Bonhoeffer takes issue with Tillich; his alternative can still be characterized as a "religious interpretation", however, if the broad sense of that term we have already indicated is accepted. Bonhoeffer's intention becomes clearer when we accept his reversal of the terms. He is concerned more with the secular interpretation of religion (or, as he would say, of "Christianity") than with the religious interpretation of secularism. Acutely aware of the event of modern secularity, he feels that the religious (or Christian) stance itself must be understood in a new way. In a religious Weltanschauung, the category of the holy receives a priority of emphasis in the polar distinction be tween sacred and profane. It is the central phenomenon through which the mundane world is understood. In a secular Weltanschauung, the situation is reversed. The profane becomes the focus of interpretation through which all other phenomena, including the holy, if it is rec ognized at all, are interpreted. To Nietzsche this radical profanity involves the total abandonment of God, metaphysics, religion. Bonhoeffer agrees and yet continues to cultivate a Christian faith that is expressed in and through this secu lar form of consciousness. Such a stance is paradoxical and ambiguous. 276 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="13">One point, however, should be noted. The purpose of Bonhoeffer and many of his disciples is to provide faith with a "secular interpretation" that does not necessarily make it acceptable to the modern mind, but acceptable to itself within the new situation. As van Buren astutely observes, a "secular interpretation of the Gospel" is required because the modern Christian discovers the seeds of profanity within himself, and not only in others to whom he wishes to communicate. In the light of these varying possibilities, three tasks are considered in the following sections: 1) the secular interpretation of secularism; 2) the religious interpretation of secularism; 3) the secular interpreta tion of religion. Secular Interpretations of Secularism Nietzsche's final philosophy represents a radical attempt to express and thereby bring into the light of total consciousness the full im plications of the "death of God." As he puts it, he wants to exorcise not only God, but all of his "shadows" from the realm of human pur view. These shadows appear in many guises, even in a philosophical thought that believes it has abandoned religious categories. Design, moral order, divine or natural law, teleology, Reality, Truth, Reason are some of the names which continue to operate as a focus whereby an ultimate meaning or absolute point of orientation is imposed upon the world. Nietzsche asks: "When will all these shadows of God cease to obscure us? When shall we have nature entirely undeifiedl When shall we be permitted to naturalize ourselves . . . ?"18 Nietzsche calls upon man to accept a total profanization of his con sciousness. This necessitates an initiation into an overwhelming nihilism, where no fixed meaning or ultimate value is recognized, either in an other worldly heaven or this worldly moral order of things. The world is "to all eternity chaos"; "everything is there, but no purposes"; only the flow of happenings without plan or design. The death of God means primarily the death of any moral interpretation of the world. Jean-Paul Sartre attempts to continue this Herculean task of ex purgating all traces of sacred value from his atheistic existentialism. He knows that "atheism is a cruel and long term affair" and the alert ness and ruthless determination with which he uncovers and annihilates vestiges of a sacred orientation remaining in his consciousness are remarkable for the tenacity of purpose they reveal. For example, after obvious forms of a religious sensibility have been destroyed, he still discovers in himself a sense of artistic "calling" that sustained him in earlier years and which he now rejects as one more atavistic symptom of bad faith.1® Both Nietzsche and Sartre consider the world to be "meaningless" and "valueless". By this they do not mean that the world is something W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 277</page><page sequence="14">negative and evil, but simply that terms of positive or negative value cannot be applied to it as a whole.20 References to the purpose, in herent direction, ultimate significance of the world are unintelligible. Yet Nietzsche and Sartre do not thereby encourage nihilism and futility. Rather they call upon man to live with the awareness that he himself in his concrete existence is the creative source of his own meanings and values. If the world is a moral chaos, without direction or goal, this is all the more reason for man to accept responsibility for the es tablishment of purposes which he has freely formed and not merely discovered in nature, heaven, or the will of God. Thus Nietzsche affirms: "Creation—that is the great redemption from suffering and life's grow ing light." He asks: "Can you give yourself your own evil and your own good and hang your own will over yourself as a law? Can you be your own judge and avenger of your law?"21 And Sartre declares that "Life is nothing until it is lived; but it is yours to make sense of, and the value of it is nothing else but the sense you chose."22 This emphasis on human freedom, responsibility, and creativity co incides with Bonhoeffer's influential references to a world "come of age" and reaching "adulthood." In this new state of secular conscious ness, man has a sense of his autonomous powers; his reason is capable of understanding his mundane world and his technological skills are able to control and transform its movements according to his own pur poses and plans. Furthermore, even the values and goals that he pursues can be created out of his own resources without the assistance of some divine law or immutable religious guide. Maturity is the abandonment of a state of helpless dependency. One no longer requires a God to perform functions he can now do himself. Neither does he foist on the divine the responsibility for the accomplishment of tasks that are clearly his own autonomous concern. The echo of the enlightenment can be heard in these assertions. Kant had already observed that "En lightenment is man's leaving his immaturity . . . self caused ... by lack of determination and courage to use one's intelligence without being guided by another . . . Have the courage to use your own in telligence!" Added to this theme is a new confidence engendered by recent technological advance with its many successes and awe-inspiring accomplishments. It is in response to this mood that Bonhoeffer announces the death of religion as dependence on a transcendent deus ex machina. Secular man does not need a divine problem-solver. Bonhoeffer observes that "there is no longer any need for God as a working hypothesis whether in morals, politics or science." He wishes to abandon the resistance of many religionists to this development and observes that "the attack by Christian apologetic upon the adulthood of the world ... is ... in the first place pointless, in the second place ignoble, and in the third un-Christian." It seemed to Bonhoeffer that such attacks are "like an 278 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="15">attempt to put a grown-up man back into adolescence; i.e., to make him dependent on things on which he is not in fact dependent any more." Bonhoeffer wants to devise a new theology of strength rather than weakness, maturity rather than childish dependency, confidence rather than despair.23 However, Nietzsche maintains that this maturity requires a costly initiation: acceptance of the death of God as the conscious abandon ment of all transcendent supports and guidance beyond the confines of the autonomous self. On this point Bonhoeffer and many of his American admirers who advocate the death of religion introduce a variation into this description. According to them, man enters into his adulthood without the dramatic and violent decision in favor of a strident atheism. Thus Bonhoeffer prefers to speak of modern man as living in the world "as if there were no God." It is a world "without God" rather than a world in which God has "died." The difference in phrasing points to a description of secular man who has discovered that he does not "need" God to solve his scientific, philosophical, or psy chological problems, and is content to bypass the whole issue of theism or atheism as irrelevant to his concerns. Thus van Buren notes: "Today, we cannot even understand the Nietzschean cry that 'God is dead!' for if it were so, how could we know? No, the problem is that the word 'God' is dead."24 In The Secular City, Cox develops this approach in a most sug gestive way. Like Bonhoeffer, he rejects an existentialism concerned with anxiety and doubt, especially when it involves an underlying re ligious concern. Cox writes: As for "the anxiety of doubt" about the God of theism, the closest today's man gets to such a state is a mild curiosity or at most a kind of wistfulness. Urban-secular man came to town after the funeral was already over. He feels no sense of deprivation and has no interest in mourning. Both philosophical existentialism and Paul Tillich's theology are expressions of the mourning period which began with the death of the God of metaphysical theism and Western Christian civilization, but the wake is now over. That is why existentialist theologies and philosophies do not partake of the spirit of the emerging age but symbolize rather the passing of the old.25 This passage is intriguing but it finally misses the mark, because it does not fully face the point of the atheism advocated by Nietzsche and Sartre. As we have seen, the "death of God" is not promulgated by them as a counsel to despair, but as the necessary prerequisite to the full autonomy and confidence desired by secular man. Nietzsche wants to cultivate a "joyous wisdom" and Sartre a "stern optimism." As Nietzsche observes, the event of the "death of God" leads to "the reverse of what was to be expected—not at all sad and depressing, but rather like a new and undescribable variety of light, happiness, relief, W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 279</page><page sequence="16">enlivenment, encouragement, and dawning day . . . our hearts overflow with gratitude, astonishment, presentiment and expectation .. . our ships can put out to sea in face of every danger . . . perhaps never before did such an open sea exist."26 The positions of Bonhoeffer and Cox raise a question they do not adequately answer. If secular maturity is considered to be the fruition of a process and development taking place in the history of culture, it may be asked whether its terminus ad quem is better described by Nietzsche or by Bonhoeffer and Cox. Whereas Cox suggests that a strident atheism is a sign of cultural adolescence, Nietzsche's myth challenges us with an alternative possibility. Perhaps it is a secularism that has not faced directly and clearly the question of atheism that has not yet fully come of age. At any rate, it is a sign of uncertainty that Cox, after having dismissed philosophical existentialism in the manner just indicated, later acknowledges his own involvement in the question raised by one eloquent existentialist—Miguel Unamuno—who asks: "Is man alone in the universe or not?" In this context Cox con fesses that to him "whether God exists or not is a desperately serious issue."27 But if so, it may be wondered if the kind of secular man who does not "ask religious questions" can be taken, as Cox urges, simply "as he is." It would seem that the "depth" secularism articulated by Nietzsche must be distinguished from a "surface" kind that avoids seri ous issues and accepts the comforts of urban life with a superficial and thoughtless complacency. We must ask whether the secular mind, unable even to understand Nietzsche's myth, has achieved a vital ma turity, or has not rather refused the pain and sacrifice involved in radical decisions that alone can lead to an authentic adulthood. It is surely significant that in Nietzsche's original parable, the madman pro claims the "death of God" to people very much like those whom van Buren and Cox describe. They "already do not believe in God" and do not find any importance, and certainly not any terror, in what the madman is proclaiming. What kind of people are these? They do not seem mature in any profound sense. Are they not those whom technocracy is protecting from pain and frustration? Their confidence is not in autonomous powers put to the test, but in the techniques of an industrial civilization that functions like Dostoevsky's "grand inquisitor" to keep them in a state of contented dependency. They inhabit Huxley's "Brave New World" and are those whom Tillich calls the "blessed animals". Nietzsche calls them the "last men" who have "invented happiness" and have become "one herd" with no shepherd. "Everybody wants the same, everybody is the same: whoever feels different goes voluntarily into a madhouse."28 It is this kind of secularity that evoked Santayana's dismay when he overheard a conversation between a modern father and daughter at 280 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="17">a railway station. When the child asked if God had made the railroad tracks, she was told, "God didn't make it. It was made by the hands of man." Santayana, himself a materialist and an atheist, found himself agreeing with the literal sense of the answer but disagreeing entirely with its tone and underlying connotations. It seemed to Santayana to express a mood of "impatience, conceit, low-minded ambition, me chanical inflation, and the worship of material comforts." It was "puerile human vanity trying to justify itself by a lie."29 Bonhoeffer was aware of this kind of surface secularism and in one passage distinguishes the kind of "worldliness" that he advocates from the "shallow this worldliness of the enlightened, of the busy, the com fortable, or the lascivious." Both Nietzsche and Bonhoeffer are thus united in their rejection of secular banality, but the profundity that each of them seeks in opposition to it is found in different directions. One cultivates the secular depth of a radical and total profanization of consciousness; the other encounters the religious depth of a "be yond" in the midst of life. Religious Interpretations of Secularism Using the terminology of William James, we can say that the depth secularism of Nietzsche is a "tough-minded" or "hard" interpretation of the "death of God" myth. However, several recent attempts have been made to provide a more "tender-minded" or "soft" interpretation, whereby secularism is still understood from a religious point of view. A. The Holy Depth The most important of these is Tillich's formulation of a theology of secular culture in which it is argued that "religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses it self. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture; culture is the form of religion."30 Tillich attempts to overcome the tension between an autonomy and a heteronomy through an understanding of the possibility of theonomy. Secular autonomy holds that man, as the bearer of reason, is the source of his own meanings and values. Heteronomy, on the other hand, pre sents the norms and rules of life as some alien and external authority to which he must relinquish his freedom and blindly submit. In a theonomous situation, man discovers that the meaning of his life is appropriated as a holy ground or depth to his existence that is the essence of his own being at the same time that it transcends it. Tillich urges contemporary man to seek for the establishment of a "theonomous culture" that will express "in its creations an ultimate W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 281</page><page sequence="18">concern and a transcending meaning not as something strange but as its own spiritual ground."31 Tillich thus views secularism from both a positive and negative point of view. If secularism is the recognition of the fact that no finite being is in itself worthy of an unconditional concern, it is an expression of the "Protestant, principle" that "protests against any absolute claim made for a relative reality."32 On the other hand, if secularism is an orientation toward the "surface" of reality that denies its relation to its own unconditional ground, then it has become a distorted form that, having lost its theonomous roots, will oscillate between claims to a shallow autonomy and a frenzied subservience to heteronomous au thoritarianism. Tillich's counsel is to develop the autonomous forms of culture to their full powers of expression without hesitation. Yet in the concern for truth, justice, beauty, power, and community man will still ex perience a seriousness of orientation that manifests a sacred ultimacy inherent in all his endeavors. Granted that there is no single meaning or purpose to the world that can be detected through a mundane anal ysis. Nevertheless, the relation of human existence to a "creative ground of being and meaning" is encountered in the experience of anxiety, courage and love, and in ecstatic moments of religious participation in the "telos" of human creativity and aspiration. The "meaning" that cannot be stated in discursive prose may yet be expressed in religious symbols that become the creative focus of a culture's deepest aspirations. It is in the light of this analysis that Tillich can view the "death of God" in a positive way. If the God of theism is merely a highest being, then the recognition of his incapacity to be the focus of an uncondi tional concern is a positive religious gain. However, even in a state of radical doubt, in which all gods, all absolutes, all foci of sacred orienta tion disappear, something remains, namely, the seriousness of that doubt in which meaning within meaninglessness is affirmed. The source of this affirmation of meaning within meaninglessness, of certitude within doubt, is not the God of traditional theism but the "God above God", the power of being, which works through those who have no name for it, not even the name God.33 B. The Secular Mandate Such a position is representative of many contemporary religious interpretations of secularism that Larry Shiner calls "dialectical" be cause they assert the continuing presence of vital relationship between sacred and secular, even in a predominantly profane orientation.34 These positions can be contrasted with the views of many of the younger secular theologians who have followed Bonhoeffer's lead and found Til lich's formulation inadequate. 282 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="19">Bonhoefïer accuses Tillich of attempting to interpret the secular trans formation of man in a religious sense "against its will." He "sought to understand the world better than it understood itself, but it felt entirely misunderstood." Cox, as we have seen, affirms that secular man is simply "puzzled by Tillich's fascination with 'meaninglessness' "; he feels no "anxiety of doubt", but at most only "a kind of wistfulness" about the question of God.35 On this interpretation, modern secularity is a phenomenon that has completely abandoned the sacred, and does not feel the need for its re-instatement in any form. Thus the emphasis is on profanization as a "historical" process that is freeing itself of the holy rather than maintaining a "dialectical" relation to it. But in that case, what kind of religious or theological interpretation of secularism is still possible? Is there any other alternative besides the holy secularism of Tillich and the radical secularism of Nietzsche? Cox encourages an approach that seeks to "nourish the seculariza tion process, to prevent it from hardening into a rigid world view, and to clarify as often as necessary its roots in the Bible."36 In Cox's discussion, three main aspects of the secularization process assume especial importance: the elimination of the sacred from all areas of mundane life, the development of man's autonomous creativity, and the abandonment of any concern for an ultimate meaning to existence. To Cox, acceptance of these three features requires the death of "religion" and "metaphysics," but not of a continuing relationship with the major themes of "biblical faith." Concerning the first feature, Cox uses the thesis of many historians, that the Hebraic insistence on the holiness of the transcendent Lord has helped to disenchant the "gods" of nature, to desacralize the "gods" of politics, and to deconsecrate the "gods" of human values. If only the Creator is sacred, this world becomes a profane landscape that man can examine and attempt to use for his own purposes without fear.37 Concerning the second feature, Cox argues that "an authentically biblical doctrine of God not only survives the view that man himself is the source of cultural meanings, but actually supports and encourages such a view."38 Cox suggests that the creation account in Genesis 2:4-24 contains a divine mandate whereby man is given the task of "naming" the features of creation and of subduing and directing them according to human goals. Properly understood, this is a call to secular maturity, to the autonomy of adulthood, and to creative acts of a humanity "come of age." Thus the modern sense of freedom, power, and autonomous creativity proceeding from man himself is no Promethean defiance of the laws of a jealous God; on the contrary, it is a mature acceptance of the divine mandate to accept responsibility for a continuation of the creative process by forming the conditions for human life in a human world. W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 283</page><page sequence="20">Here is a truly exalted view of man. God does not simply insert man into a world filled with creatures which are already named, in relationships and meaning patterns already established by de cree. Man must fashion them himself. He doesn't simply discover meaning; he originates it.39 Concerning the third point, Cox argues, as we have already noted, that urban-secular man "does not feel this compulsion to find some in clusive and overarching meaning." But Cox points out that the Biblical God does not offer Himself for "use" in this way "as the kingpin in an ontological system" which "is not much different from wheedling Him into watering my corn." Rather the Hidden God meets man in the events of historical and political change where specific tasks of making the human world truly human are given him. Thus a truly secular theology adopts "the living lexicon of the urban-secular man", and discovers that politics has replaced metaphysics as its expressive form.40 In spite of many intriguing features in this analysis, it is difficult to see how it provides a distinctive alternative to the positions represented by Nietzsche and Tillich. Cox's analysis seems to encourage either a further movement of the "irreversible" process of secularization toward Nietzsche's profane autonomy or else the acceptance in some form of Tillich's view of a dialectical and continuing vital relation between the secular and sacred aspects of existence. At critical points in their discussion, Cox and Bonhoeffer finally opt for this latter possibility. For example, although Cox urges us to accept a world that is radically desacralized, it remains a world in which the Hidden God is present at the junctures of historical change. But such a world in which the Holy One is still relevant in mysterious ways beyond the control of man has not been profanized to the extent demanded by Nietzsche, who rather argues that even if the Biblical view once assisted in initiating the process of secularization, it allowed, at best, for the emergence of cultural adolescence. To Nietzsche's profane man, adulthood means the death of all the gods, including the Hidden God of the Bible, who, after liberating man from bondage to nature and politics, is now felt to be an oppressive check to the full development of man's autonomy. Modern man will not settle to be a junior partner in the firm. He must put his former employer in total bankruptcy and take over the full management of the company himself. Thus Eliade writes: Modern non-religious man assumes a new existential situation; he regards himself solely as the subject and agent of history, and he refuses all appeal to transcendence. In other words, he accepts no model for humanity outside the human condition as it can be seen in the various historical situations. Man makes himself, and he only makes himself completely as he desacralizes himself and the world. The sacred is the prime obstacle to his freedom. He 284 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="21">will become himself only when he is totally de-mysticized. He will not be truly free until he has killed the last god.41 Cox considers such a view to be "secularism," of which he disapproves and contrasts with "secularization" as a process by which all absolutes, including atheism, are desacralized. But the distinction works best in the area of political secularization. Secularism as an ideology must be willing to be one force among many in the contemporary scene, and not assume the status of an established secular faith demanding the subjugation of all other powers to it. But the pressing question that still demands an answer is not whether the ideology of secularism will accept a relativized position within the social order, but whether, within the consciousness of the individual himself, secularity will or will not assume an absolute or total form. Nietzsche's "death of God" myth is a challenge to accept just such a task of profane totalization of the self in all its feelings, aspirations, and forms of thought. By retaining his orientation to the Hidden God, Cox, with Tillich, obviously has re fused to accept the full force of this challenge without important quali fications. Concerning the issue of autonomous creativity, Cox observes that when "the tyrant God of both atheism and theism disappears, ... the partnership of God and man comes into focus." He concludes: "Given the fact that man in dialogue fashions the meanings by which history proceeds . . . one utterly crucial question remains: Is this responsibility something which man himself has conjured, or is it given to him?" He decides: "Man in order to be free and responsible, which means to be man, must answer to that which is not man."42 But such a posi tion is very different from the kind of autonomy advocated by Nietzsche and Sartre, and is very close to those of religious existentialists like Tillich and religious metaphysicians like Whitehead, whom Cox has supposedly rejected. Tillich emphasizes the participation of human existence in the creative power of the divine ground of being and mean ing. Whitehead refers to the "particular relevance (of God) to each creative act as it arises from its own conditioned standpoint in the world."43 In more ecstatic language Buber writes: Creation happens to us, burns itself into us, recasts us in burn ing—we tremble and are faint, we submit. We take part in crea tion, meet the Creator, reach out to him, helpers and com panions.44 Cox uses language formed by Biblical personalism to affirm that man "works as God's partner in ordering the chaos." The terms differ, but the underlying intentions converge. To all of these thinkers, includ ing Cox, secular and sacred movements within the process of life meet and interact with one another. Similarly, Bonhoeffer and Cox do not differ with Tillich on the W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 288</page><page sequence="22">question of "ultimate meaning" as much as some of their statements suggest. Tillich nowhere claims to have stated in metaphysical terms a meaning that is the rational key to a system of thought. He does argue that man's personal existence reveals a concern for the ultimate significance of his life, which is the heart of what we call religion, in the broad sense of the term. Cox seems to be in basic agreement with this view of man when he insists that modern secular man still experiences the transcendent "as those aspects of our experience which can never be transmuted into extensions of ourselves." It is difficult to detect any difference from Tillich in Cox's assertion that the difference between men of Biblical faith and serious non-theists is not that we do not encounter the same reality. The difference is that we give that reality a different name, and in naming it differently, we differ seriously in the way we respond.45 And Bonhoeffer also searches for God at the "center of life" and de clares that through the man Jesus Christ "life has a meaning for us."46 Evidently the search for ultimate meaning, and a point of sacred focus in the midst of the secular phenomenon, has not really been abandoned by Bonhoeffer's progeny, any more than it has by Tillich. It would seem that the "historical" interpretation of secularism must retain some form of the "dialectical" interpretation if it is to keep any kind of religious or theological orientation at all. C. The Profane Burden Another aspect of the preceding analysis that requires further con sideration is the emphasis on optimism and the positive affirmation of secularity. On this point Bonhoeffer's thought is more complex than has so far been indicated. Having explored the need for a theology of strength and joy, his further remarks make clear that this is only one strain in the "polyphony" of life.47 Strength and joy provide a ground base that is a counterpoint of pain and sacrifice. To Bonhoeffer, worldliness is a polar category containing both secular and Christo logical themes: I don't mean the shallow this-worldliness of the enlightened, of the busy, the comfortable or the lascivious. It's something much more profound than that, something in which the knowledge of death and resurrection is ever present . . . This is what I mean by worldliness—taking life in one's stride, with all its duties and problems, its successes and failures, its experiences and helpless ness. It is in such a life that we throw ourselves utterly into the arms of God and participate in his sufferings in the world and watch with Christ in Gethsemane.48 In Bonhoeffer's letters there is the suggestion that the secular con 286 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="23">sciousness is accepted by the Christian as a strange form of redemptive suffering. The God who makes us live in this world without using him as a working hypothesis is the God before whom we are ever stand ing. Before God and with him we live without God. God allows himself to be edged out of the world and on to the cross . . . Man is challenged to participate in the sufferings of God at the hands of a godless world.48 This thought is also expressed in the writings of Altizer, though the elements of his position owe more to Eliade than to Bonhoeffer. Altizer's position is a difficult fusion of Biblical theology, a phenomenology of the sacred, mystical patterns of negation, and a Hegelian sense of the movement and transformation of consciousness through historical dialectic. He sees the two views of reality—the sacred and profane—in radical opposition. To the fully developed secular consciousness, Holy Reality is meaningless, is nothing. But in similar fashion affirmation of the Holy Reality means the eschatological "end"; the annihilation of an independent, profane mode of being. The present moment in history is one in which the secular consciousness is emerging as supreme. God has died; the sacred is eliminated; only profane being exists. Altizer differs from many of his colleagues in the specific attitude he takes toward this phenomenon. To Cox, the profane consciousness is ful filling the mandate of the creator God of Genesis. Thus, "we must learn to love it in its unremitting secularity." Hamilton finds that he is not "particularly cast down or perplexed" by the acceptance of God's death. Altizer's writings, on the contrary, reflect a religious sensibility that enters the profane world with pain and terror. He observes that the Christian cannot isolate himself from "the emptiness, the mean inglessness, and the sheer horror of the world." Since the secular mode of consciousness is now the present form of being human, the Chris tian religious man cannot refuse this form without refusing his human ity. He "lives this life, sharing all its fullness and emptiness, its joy and its horror, knowing that his destiny is to live here and now, allow ing his life to be the metal which God's fire will transform into his Kingdom."50 The radical aspect of Altizer's position is that he has rejected the possibility that modern man can adhere to the sacred view of Eliade's primitive shaman. Nor does he accept the attempt of Tillich to show that secular man still retains the sacred in the form of the ultimate concern that emerges in the midst of his profane pursuits. Altizer believes that a historical faith must move in and through the present moment of radical and total profanity to a "new" reality beyond. Thus the acceptance in radical form of the "death of God" means that what is hoped for is not just a repetition of past forms of religious W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 287</page><page sequence="24">consciousness. Something truly "new" is longed for. Thus, "The Chris tian World moves only by negating its own past expressions." It is seeking an "eschatological end that transcends a primordial begin ning."" Altizer thus shares with Tillich the concern for a new theonomy in which the emptiness of the profane is again open to the fullness of the sacred. Yet Altizer attempts to combine the dialectical and his torical elements in this interpretation in a more radical manner than Tillich does. Tillich suggests that perhaps the theonomy will emerge within a culture structured by Christian symbols properly chastened and purged. Altizer rather suggests that the Christian symbols them selves must undergo a more radical negation and "death" as the price to be paid before the present profane reality is transformed into a sacred theophony once again.52 Secular Interpretations of "God" The myth of the "death of God" focuses attention on the various understandings of the ensuing secular consciousness that are possible. However, an opposite task also presents itself: to consider how the new form of secularism in turn may affect the understanding and interpretation of religion. But a secular interpretation of Western re ligion becomes fundamentally a secular interpretation of "God," which has been the central symbolic focus of Western religious aspiration. This powerful symbol has a rich texture and complexity of mean ing that can not be summarized in a single definition. The dramatic myths and stories of the Bible have caused many to interpret it in anthropomorphic terms, but the Bible also contains an emphasis on God's mystery and incomprehensibility; no images of Him are to be made, and his mysterious Name is to be treated with a sacred circum spection. As we have seen, Nietzsche associates the symbol with a variety of themes: the other world, ultimate purpose, immutable perfection, moral will, Holy Love, Sacred Mystery. God's "death" announces a new consciousness in which all of these points of orientation are absent. However, contemporary attempts to refer in a secular fashion to "God" as the focus of at least some of these themes continue to be made. These efforts represent a variety of philosophical and religious backgrounds. One characteristic that almost all of them hold in common is a sense of reticence about direct reference to "God" either in lan guage or in action. All direct characterization of "God," whether as a Holy and Personal Will, the fulfillment of existence, the meaning of life, the ultimate focus of concern, the ground of being, the lure of feeling, etc., are felt to be ambiguous, inadequate, inappropriate. This situation is caused by the fact that, in a secular world, language is itself mundane and its meanings are all formulated by empirical 288 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1968</page><page sequence="25">references to aspects of worldly experience. A religious use of this language must consequently be indirect, elusive, and oblique. This reticence is not considered to be a forthright denial of the actuality of "God," but a recognition of the inappropriateness of any direct and immediate form of orientation toward it. In some manner, the divine presence is still recognized, yet a tension and agony is experienced in any attempt to articulate it by the use of mundane vehicles of ex pression. In a striking manner that reflects the contemporary dominance of the profane consciousness, the agony of theistic speech can be recognized in both particular Christian theologies and in more general philoso phies of religion. A. Secular Christology For example, there is a tendency in recent Protestant thought that in its most radical form (Hamilton and van Buren) has culminated in a "Christological atheism." This puzzling attempt to retain a re ligious orientation toward Christ "without God" is more understand able when interpreted as the climax to a style of theological reticence already present in the more conservative positions of Barth and Bon hoeffer. Although Barth is often considered to be a dogmatic, almost reac tionary thinker, the fact is that his traditional theology is founded on a very profane analysis of the human situation. Barth accepts the contemporary rejection of natural theology and of any attempt to find a point of contact between the human and the divine. He main tains that no mundane evidence, argument or experience can reveal the presence of God within the world. Yet Barth is not a profane secularist, but rather a profane theologian experiencing the agony of theistic speech. In an early essay, he makes three paradigmatic asser tions: "We ought to speak of God; we are human, however, and so cannot speak of God; we ought therefore to recognize both that we should speak of God and yet cannot, and by that very recognition give God the glory."63 Barth then uses this very tension as the basis for a "High Christology." In the miracle of his revelation in Christ, God is declared to have established his own ground of reference and meaning. He who cannot be meaningfully spoken about or manipulated within a mundane con text is now proclaimed through that "worldly" act in Christ where he makes himself known. Barth here follows in the tradition of those Christian thinkers who have discovered in the Bible the Hidden God (Pascal), the deus absconditus (Luther), the Divine Incognito (Kierke gaard), who can be the proper object of neither sense perception, hu man feeling, or rational conceptualization. Furthermore, Barth's position W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 289</page><page sequence="26">enables him to accept the death of religion or of God with equanimity. The Mysterious Reality of the Hidden God is distinguished from all mundane "gods," including the "God" of Western Christendom. The latter is considered by many Barthians to be a fusion of improperly understood Biblical insights, with philosophical notions of an immuta ble substance and the cultural projections of ultimate human ideals formulated by European civilization. It is argued that all such human "gods" are born in the womb of consciousness and eventually die. Perhaps we are now at the end of an era and are witnessing the demise of the God of Christendom. Faith in the Living God is not threatened by such an event. Thus the early Barth can note: What men this side of resurrection name "God" is most charac teristically not God ... he is, in fact, "no-God". The cry of re volt against such a god is nearer the truth than is the sophistry with which men attempt to justify him. Indeed, "The revolt of Prometheus is wholly justified when once Zeus— the 'no-God'—has been exalted to the throne of God."54 Some of the new secular theologians are obviously continuing this emphasis, with refinements. Vahanian describes the emergence of a post-Christian era in which "the death of God means the death of those pagan deities that had somehow survived in the Christian cul tural conception of God." However, he entertains the hope that this event may "yet enable Christianity to clarify the Biblical concept of God as the Wholly Other, because he is the Creator and not a natural force."55 Altizer also refers to the death of the God who is an "idea," even if it is called "absolute, infinite, unconditional, true Being." Cox contemplates the possibility that "our English word God will have to die, corroborating in some measure Nietzsche's apocalyptic judgment that God is deadl" But Cox contrasts the subject of this death with "the One we met both in the life of Jesus and in our present history as the liberator and the hidden one."56 However, the secular theologians who are influenced by Bonhoeffer are dissatisfied with Barth's position even while being strongly influ enced by it. Bonhoeffer rejects Barth's "positivistic doctrine of revela tion" that is given to man on a "take it or leave it basis," and sug gests that the dogmatic form of his later expositions has obscured the essentially "worldly" character of the gospel.57 Evidently the resistance to Barth from this quarter is caused by the ease with which Barth is finally able to talk about the nature of God and his attributes once the fact of revelation is accepted. Bonhoeffer is concerned to formulate a mundane Christology in which such direct references to God will be more radically subordinated to a focus on the secular Jesus. The seeds of an approach Bonhoeffer did not live to formulate in detail are found in the following note: 290 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="27">What do we mean by "God"? Not in the first place an abstract belief in his omnipotence, etc. That is not a genuine experience of God, but a partial extension of the world. Encounter with Jesus Christ, implying a complete orientation of human being in the experience of Jesus as one whose only concern is for others. This concern of Jesus for others the experience of transcendence. This freedom from self, maintained to the point of death, the sole ground of his omnipotence, omniscience and ubiquity. Faith is the participation in this Being of Jesus (incarnation, cross and resurrection). Our relation to God not a religious relationship to a Supreme Being, absolute in power and goodness, which is a spurious conception of transcendence, but a new life for others, through participation in the Being of God. The transcendence consists not in tasks beyond our scope and power, but in the near est thing to hand.®8 The crucial sentence here is: "Our relation to God [is] not a religious relation to a Supreme Being . . . but a new life for others." As Bon hoeffer meant it, God is not thereby denied; nevertheless, the personal orientation of Christian man turns from God to the neighbor. Jesus has given to man the freedom to be concerned, not with the divine, but with the "other" in his needs and problems. Cox is very close to Bonhoeffer's intent when he observes that modern man is turning from the compulsive interest in "finding" and "experiencing" God to the Christological task of being "for others" in the midst of social and political change. "God wants man to be interested not in Him but in his fellow man."59 On such a view God is "dead", "absent"; not only because of the difficulty of theistic speech, but because of the improper diversion ref erence to God can create for religious action. God must be considered as a reality only obliquely and indirectly known, because Christian man is not called to aspire for a direct awareness of him, but to orient himself toward the worldly being of the other person in his need. In Bonhoeffer's thought, this theme is also associated with the assump tion of the profane burden that is encountered in Jesus. "The God who is with us is the God who forsakes us"—just as Jesus cried "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Two other recent thinkers have offered a more radical interpreta tion. Whereas Cox still holds that in Jesus the Hidden One acts in ways not available for human inspection and manipulation, Hamilton finds that even this God has "died." But the "time" of his death is "also the time of obedience to Jesus . . . The Christian is defined . . . as the man bound to Jesus, obedient to him and obedient as he was obedient."60 Van Buren attempts to justify Bonhoeffer's hope that a non-religious interpretation of Christianity is possible by means of a method that "never occurred to Bonhoeffer." Van Buren makes use of a verification principle developed by certain linguistic philosophers to argue that W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 291</page><page sequence="28">"statements of faith are to be interpreted ... as statements which ex press, describe or commend a particular way of seeing the world, other men, and oneself, and the way of life appropriate to such a perspec tive." Following Bonhoeffer's lead, the Christian is described as one who has adopted the perspective of a new freedom for others revealed in the life of Jesus. In this secular interpretation, all reference to a transcendent God is eliminated as redundant and meaningless. If, in a momentary lapse, theistic language is used, the secular theologian would ask if the life of Jesus has not shown that God "wants men to stop trying to peer into the clouds and to obey God's will by thinking out their existence in terms of man—specifically the man in whom God has said all that he has to say to men?"81 The positions of Hamilton and van Buren can be interpreted as a radical but logical development of a trend within Protestant theology which, even in its more orthodox phase, has excised all attempts to relate a "general" knowledge of God in the human mind and heart with the "particular" revelation in Christ. Theology becomes identical with —Christology. A Christomonism expels any other meaningful reference to the divine. Finally, we reach the position of an "atheistic Christology," which, once its historical antecedents are understood, is a curious, but no longer paradoxical, phenomenon. What is paradoxical about this position is its ambiguous relation to a radical secularism. Its advocates sometimes imply that their stance is an attempt to help the "secular Christian" understand his own orientation within the emergence of the profane worldview. But in other moods they imply that they are addressing "secular man" in a radical manner. However, in a world in which all absolutes have "died," it is far from clear how an absolute commitment to the man from Nazareth is any more attractive or meaningful than the commitment to "God" which has been rejected. From a radically secular viewpoint, varying evalua tions of Jesus' teaching and his "perspective" are possible. As a purely profane achievement, his life may still warrant respect, but hardly the absoluteness of commitment that Hamilton and van Buren advocate and which will surely seem, granted their presuppositions, increasingly to be a last atavistic survival from a "religious" age in a "profane" age where it does not belong. All these positions, from Barth on the "right" to van Buren on the "left," exemplify the same reticence about theistic language connected to a Christological focus with varying degrees of emphasis. To Barth, it is in and through Christ that the "Hidden God" is truly "known." With Bonhoeffer and Cox, his mysterious actuality is still encountered, but more indirectly and obliquely through the confrontation with "the Man for others." With Hamilton and van Buren, the presence has receded even further from the locus of awareness, so that only Jesus remains as the point of meaningful religious reference. In one im 292 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="29">portant sense none of these positions exhibits a radical secularism; they are all fundamentally addressed to "Christian man" who wants to un derstand the secular form of his faith. They do not confront "secular man" with any reason why he should retain the one absolute of obedi ence to Jesus, if this is really a world in which all absolutes have "died". B. Secular Existentialism The same reticence about theistic language expressed by the thinkers just considered has been retained by others within the categories of an existential personalism or humanism. Bultmann, who shares much of the perspective just considered, argues that a general analysis of human existence through concepts is possible, but that it only pro vides knowledge of the world as a system of "objects." However, within the moments of our concrete living existence, another kind of "non objective" knowledge is possible. For example, love can be analyzed in a general, objective manner, but the actual existential love between two persons is only "known" within the encounter itself. So the reality of God is not known through general analysis but through faith as the existential response of obedience to the One who is met in Christ, though never comprehended apart from the encounter itself. Buber argues in a similar manner, though without the Christological orientation. He refers to the I-it relationship where a person achieves only an abstract, partial contact with the other, and treats him as an abstract object to be manipulated and used. The I-thou meeting, on the other hand, achieves mutuality, wholeness and concreteness. Finally, through the vistas of these finite I-thou relationships, man becomes aware of the Eternal Thou, that absolute relationship in which the Eternal Other can only be "Thou", never "it." "The extended lines of relation meet in the eternal thou." This analysis has a profound "this worldly" emphasis. Buber asserts that the meeting with the Eternal Thou is the establishment of the meaning to life which "is not that of another life, but that of this life of ours, not one of a world yonder, but that of this world of ours, and it desires its confirmation in this life and in relation to this world."62 Both Bultmann and Buber insist on the indirect, eliptical character of this existential knowledge of the divine. As Buber puts it, God is addressed, not expressed, for every attempt to conceptualize his reality as "thou" transforms him into an idolatrous "it." Thus Buber, in a manner similar to Bonhoeffer, warns against a false orientation toward "God" instead of the world in which authentic relation occurs: Meeting with God does not come to man in order that he may concern himself with God, but in order that he may confirm that there is meaning in the world. All revelation is summons and sending . . . the man who seeks God . . . instead of allowing the gift to work itself out reflects about the Giver—and misses both.68 W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 293</page><page sequence="30">C. Secular Mysticism The linguistic reticence concerning references to God is expressed in an even more extreme form by a number of writers who develop what might be called a secular mysticism. Mysticism does not here mean the attempt to find release from the problems of this world through entrance into some higher realm of being, but rather a radical experience of the agony of using mundane language to express what cannot be said in its secular categories. A speechless awareness remains of that which cannot be directly indicated in words. Surprisingly, some results of recent linguistic analysis have supported this mood. A rigorous account of verification, reference, and meaning shows the difficulty or impossibility of denoting "God" according to the norms of the ordinary usage of words. It is true that some analysts following the "later" Wittgenstein attempt to show contexts in which the word "God" can still be meaningfully "used." But if one adheres to the more restricted sense of meaning enunciated by the "early" Wittgenstein, the presence of the mystical remains. The early Wittgen stein declares that the "world is the totality of facts" and that "God does not reveal himself in the world." However, he notes: "There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical." The concluding sentence of the Tractatus has lent itself to a most suggestive ambiguity. Wittgenstein writes: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Most logical positivists have interpreted this to be a denial of the significance of mysticism, but in the light of the other sentence cited, an opposite understanding is also possible. Per haps it expresses an appreciation of that which the silence expresses in a manner that speech cannot approximate.64 Does the "death of God" mean the death of religious word and sign? Has "God" as formulated symbol vanished so that his presence may be known in a way that is both more direct and more indirect at the same time? Is the "death of God" the call to mysticism rather than atheism? Or has the myth rather announced again the strange affinity that often appears between them? One modern mystic—Simone Weil—calls at least some forms of atheism "a purification of the notion of God." Thus: "A method of purification: to pray to God, not only in secret so far as men are concerned, but with the thought that God does not exist." Or again: "God and the supernatural are hidden and formless in the universe. It is well that they should be hidden and nameless in the soul. Otherwise there would be a risk of having something imaginary under the name of God . . . Christianity {Catholic and Protestant) speaks too much about holy things." A less paradoxical statement is: "I am quite sure that there is a God in the sense that I am quite sure my love is not illusory. I am quite sure that there is not a God in the sense that I am quite 294 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="31">sure nothing real can be anything like what I am able to conceive when I pronounce this word. But that which I cannot conceive is not an illusion."65 Mysticism so understood has significant affinities with prophetic iconoclasm and what Tillich calls the "Protestant principle". Symbols that were originally offered as vehicles of sacred expression are now seen as idols that have substituted a finite form for the inexpressible reality. The "death of God" is the recognition that a once numinous Image exerting a powerful influence on Western civilization is itself only an "Image" and not, as Buber puts it, the One "who shines through all forms and is Himself formless", the One who is "the deep abyss out of which images arise."66 Mysticism, atheism, and prophetic iconoclasm participate in a common task: the purgation of images, the purification of symbols, and the destruction of idols. Frequently this radical purgation leaves the residue of one negative image or anti-image—the absence of God or the Sacred Void. Language becomes extremely paradoxical as mystical negations reveal underlying affirmations and all affirmations are subjected to purifying negations. Thus the very absence of God from the profane world becomes an allusive testimony to the reality of his presence. Such language offends common sense and the norms of a rigorous logic. Yet many existentialists have argued that a negation can be the subject of a positive experience. For example, Sartre has an intriguing analysis about the experience of a room in which Pierre used to be encountered, but from which he is now absent. Sartre argues that Pierre's former companion now experiences not only the positive fea tures of the room that remain, but the absence of Pierre from it.6T Whether or not this analysis is valid from a phenomenological or lin guistic point of view, it can be used as a model for a kind of mystical language used about the presence of God's absence in the world. Such language is used in some interesting and surprising contexts. For example, in Huxley's Brave New World the director of the tech nological Utopia is asked: "Then you think there is no God?" "No. I think there quite probably is one. But he manifests him self in different ways to different men. In pre-modern times he manifested himself as the being described in these books. Now . . . he manifests himself as an absence; as though he weren't there at all."67 From a variety of authors, similar reference is made to the Eclipse (Buber); "the nothing as the hither side of God" (Altizer); the void (Weil). Hamilton, in a curious manner, expresses himself in the same vein, even while attempting to maintain a "tough-minded" denial of God's existence. He writes: "God is dead. We are not talking about the absence of the experience of God, but about the experience of the W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 295</page><page sequence="32">absence of God."68 His effort to achieve a definite clarity in his denial fails, because the latter reference to an "experience of the absence" has even more mystical overtones than the former reference to an "absence of the experience." But if the negative awareness of the divine remains, why should it take such a paradoxical and elusive form? Here the traditional approaches of Biblical religion, mysticism, spiritual piety, and existen tial personalism coalesce and converge. In the personal terms of Biblical theism, shall we speak of the absence as a deliberate withdrawal? Is it a sign of the holy displeasure over the sin of man? Or is it rather a sign of the sacred mercy and creative love? Is it true, as Simone Weil puts it, that "God could create only by hiding himself. Otherwise there would be nothing but himself"? Is the absence, then, a necessary aspect of the secular mandate? God allows himself to be edged out of the world, so that man may have room to develop his autonomous powers. Is the absence of God his gift to the necessary coming of age of his world? Or, in the language of piety and mysticism, shall we interpret the void as that "dark night of the soul," the period of thirst and testing that precedes the beatific moment of union with the divine? Or shall we, with Buber, rather say that our de-humanized relations with man and nature have created the monster of an "I-it" that, "gigantically swollen", steps in "and shuts off from us the light of heaven"? One cause of the sense of the "absence" of God leads secular man to Nietzsche's preferred image of God's "death". It is not only the agony of language to express the inexpressible that is experienced by the contemporary mind; it is also the agony of human suffering. As Nietzsche insists, the moral God of benevolent purposes is "dead" in a world in which the pain of children and the misery of countless persons is an oppressive reality. But in the secular mysticism we are considering, the nihilism of a futile emptiness is countered by the nihilism of a meaningful void. If God is known as an Emptiness that cannot be expressed and who, in the presence of evil, is absent, two religious responses remain for secular man. The first is the sense of secular time as the moment of waiting for the emptiness to be filled. Buber, Weil, Altizer, Hamilton, Vahanian—all, in different ways, approach the mood of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets: I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought: So the darkness shall lie the light, and the stillness the dancing.69 Developing this approach further in a mystical direction, Simon 296 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1966</page><page sequence="33">Weil speaks not only of "waiting", but of "fidelity in the void." In the presence of evil, pain, and suffering, I am aware of the absence of God, of meaning, of fulfillment. Yet by accepting this lack and emptiness, I participate in a mystical movement of life as well as thought, whereby "The void is the supreme fullness, but man is not permitted to know it." Thus, "By redemptive suffering, God is present in extreme evil. For the absence of God is the mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil—absence which is felt. He who has not God within himself cannot feel his absence."70 At times the emphasis on suffering love causes the mystical sense of absence to be transformed into positive reference to a "suffering God." At this point, writers from metaphysical, mystical, and Biblical tradi tions converge on a common attempt to reconstruct a divine image that is a radical alternative to the "God" whom Nietzsche has de clared "dead." Nietzsche declares that the omniscient and omnipotent Creator de stroys man's freedom and creativity and is incompatible with the chaotic world of suffering. In a number of twentieth century minds has emerged a new image of the power of God that is expressed in the "weakness" of suffering love rather than the energy of dynamic force. Thus White head, like Nietzsche, rejects the image of the Oriental Potentate creat ing and ruling the world through his overwhelming might. Whitehead finds in parts of Plato and the Galilean Jesus the strands of another theme that does not "emphasize the Ruling Caesar, or the ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover. It dwells upon the tender elements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operate by love." God uses "persuasion", not force; he attracts rather than impels. "The power of God is the worship He inspires." Nor is this love unrelated to the tragedies and pains of life. God's life is involved in man's life, and the tragedies of lost value belong to the divine as well as the human dimension of existence. "God is the great companion—the fellow-suf ferer who understands."71 Buber rejects, with Nietzsche, the image of the God who freezes man into an object with his "look"; this is the pseudo-divine object who appears in the I-it relationship. But in the religious I-Thou meeting, God is the Other who confirms the rich concrete self-hood of man's own being. God has enough "power" to let man be himself without absorbing him into his own identity, or destroying man's creativity by making him into the dead object of divine scrutiny. A more ecstatic mysticism is advanced by Weil. She notes the opinion of Thucydides that every being must, by a necessity of nature, exer cise all the power of which it is capable. But the "power" of God is discovered in his capacity to deny his strength; to let the world be, and to suffer with it. Weil refers to the "crucified God" and asserts that "in our being, God is torn. We are the crucifixion of God . . . W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 297</page><page sequence="34">The mutual love of God and man is suffering."72 Berdyaev writes: "We can only reconcile ourselves to the tragedy of the world because God suffers in it too." Tillich affirms: "The power of God is that he overcomes estrangement, not that he prevents it; this is the meaning of the age-old symbol of the god participating in creaturely suffer ing. . . Finally, as we have noted, Bonhoeffer, having celebrated the power and strength of the world, expresses his awareness of a cor responding "powerlessness and suffering of God." He declares: "Only a suffering God can help." The sensitivity of Nietzsche's mind to the nuances of the contem porary outlook is revealed in his anticipation of this very theme of the "suffering God." A concern with "power", of course, dominates Nietzsche's explorations, but in Christian compassion he can find only a temptation to indulge in human weakness and mediocrity. Thus his myth combines irony with insight by suggesting that God has died of his "pity" for mankind. God and his followers experience a heightened ability to feel the pain of the world that is not overcome by a cor responding will to power. The God who must die, and the human sensibility that must die with it, is one that is driven by the agony of "pity" into the search for escape into religious heavens, metaphysical realms, "other worlds" that, because they are not this world, are "noth • _ tf The issues here are complex and not yet finally settled. Twentieth century religious thought is clearly attempting to devise a theology of love that combines the truth about strength with the truth about compassion. Nietzsche offered an impressive warning about the dis tortions of pity alienated from strength. Perhaps he failed to recognize the distortions of power alienated from sympathy as the capacity to "suffer with." Nietzsche's myth is thus subject to two alternative in terpretations: either it is the God of pity who has died to make room for autonomous man; or it is the God of worldly power who has died to make room for the strength of holy suffering. Conclusion: The Unification of Life Nietzsche's proclamation of the death of an "other worldly God" has announced the dissolution of radical dualisms. The converse of this is the affirmation of a unification of life and human existence. If we agree to accept the unification of the "other world" and "this world," can this feat include a synthesis of the historic dichotomy between the sacred and the profane? One impressive attempt to accomplish the task through a secular metaphysics has been offered by Whitehead. He demonstrates the ability of contemporary metaphysics to survive Nietzsche's knife by providing a general analysis of time, creativity, and change. Rather than the last 298 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1986</page><page sequence="35">gasp of a dying world-view that is other-worldly and static, Whitehead represents a new movement toward metaphysical thought that is this worldly and "open" to the process of dynamic change. As far as theology is concerned, the most radical feature of Whitehead's posi tion is his willingness to apply mundane categories directly to God. In an intriguing manner, he uses the very objection raised by Bon hoeffer and Cox against metaphysical religion as its basic justifica tion. Bonhoeffer and Cox object to the "use" of "God" as a deus ex machina hypothesis that solves problems within an ontological sys tem; Whitehead argues that the mistake of past theology has rather been to view God as "an exception to all metaphysical principles, in voked to save their collapse." He urges us instead to consider "God" as "their chief exemplification."78 In this manner, he seeks to show how theology can be mundane and secular and at the same time include the sacred focus of life in a gen eral, unified perspective. Thus he points to the mutual relation of God and nature by means of their common participation in the "formative character of the actual temporal world." A major charac teristic of this world is creativity or "temporal passage to novelty." Men live in "a common world of mutual adjustment, of intelligible relations, of valuations, of zest after purposes." The process of change is directed toward an increase in value that reveals the presence and power of God as a factor in that growth. "The power by which God sustains the world is the power of himself as the ideal. He adds himself to the actual ground from which every creative act takes its use. The world lives by its incarnation of God in itself." Yet God also "transcends the temporal world, because ... He is the actual fact from which the other formative elements cannot be torn apart."74 Such an attempt at unification differs sharply from Nietzsche's. His radical secularism seems to imply that the unification takes place through elimination of God and of any ideal focus. If the sense of sacred orientation and ultimate meaning is excised from life, then a single profane reality remains. However, it can be argued that what Nietzsche actually accomplishes is the sacralization of the profane reality itself in its totality. In spite of Nietzsche's rage at the thought that some day he will be pronounced "holy", the fact remains that, as Erich Heller observes, He is, by the very texture of his soul and mind, one of the most radically religious natures that the 19th century brought forth, but endowed with an intellect which guards, with the aggressive jeal ousy of a watch-dog, all the approaches to the temple.75 Nietzsche records, for example, the observation of the "Old Pope" to Zarathustra that "you are more pious than you believe ... Is it not your piety itself that no longer lets you believe in a god?"76 But what kind of piety is possible after the "death of God"? And Nietzsche re W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 299</page><page sequence="36">jects the idea—which he considers Christian—that suffering is "the path to a sacred existence," by which he means an "other world." But he con trasts this rejected view with the judgment that "existence is considered sacred enough to justify even a tremendous amount of suffering. The tragic man affirms even the harshest suffering: he is sufficiently strong, rich, and deifying for this."77 It might seem that Nietzsche's goal of the "overman" contradicts his affirmation of love for the meaningless process itself. Indeed, Nietzsche argues that man seeks the "epoch" of the "condition of maxi mum power," and even allows for the use of the symbol "God" as the "culminating moment; life is an eternal process of deifying and un deifying."78 This positive use of "God" in these late notes substantiates an observation made in Zarathustra that "in the case of the gods, death is always a mere prejudice."79 Nietzsche insists, however, that nature as an evolutionary movement does not itself have any "purpose", though man may himself choose the goal of "maximum power." Amor fati remains as the response to the meaningless and chaotic alternation of "deifying" and "undeify ing" moments that characterize the eternal (i.e., unending) succession of time. In Tillich's terminology we might say that Nietzsche has at tempted to uncover a "secular depth" within the profane meaningless ness by revealing the sacredness of the meaninglessness itself. Tillich attempts, rather, to uncover a "depth" which reveals the meaning that informs the meaninglessness of the mundane and transforms it. Both Buber and Tillich are concerned with the possibility of "uni fication" of the sacred and profane aspects of life. Buber is influenced by the Hasidic attempt to "hallow" everyday existence. He declares that "man was created for the purpose of unifying the two worlds" of the sacred and the profane.80 Tillich considers the existence of "re ligion" as a special sphere among others to be evidence of a "tragic estrangement of man's spiritual life from its own ground and depth." He is impressed by the vision in the Book of Revelation where it is declared that there is "no temple in the heavenly Jerusalem," hence no special distinction between sacred and secular realms.81 How does this unification take place? The younger theologians ad vocating the death of religion are afraid of any tendency to "thwart and reverse the liberating irritant of secularization" (Cox). They do not want a sacralization that will mean an atavistic return to a re ligious world in which "powers" of nature or politics are deified and given an absolute authority over human life. Such a situation would be the result of a kind of sacralization, accomplished through the direct identification of the mundane phenomenon with the sacred, which, in prophetic categories, is idolatry. But perhaps it is possible to consider a "unification" that is ac complished, not by idolatrous "identification," but by "sacramental 3Θ0 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 196*</page><page sequence="37">participation." In this view, all aspects of existence are profane and yet capable of being "hallowed" without thereby becoming idols. Secu larization is a necessary process whereby the relative and finite char acter of any particular worldly phenomenon is recognized. But sacralization is the integral complement of the same process whereby its participation in an orientation toward the sacred significance of existence is made possible. It can be argued that this kind of dialectical sacralization is a firmer support to the positive features of secularization than is the attempt to eliminate the sacred completely. If the sacred is a necessary constituent of human life, its radical exclusion will not be possible, and the unwitting deification of some mundane phenomenon—the na tion, an economic movement, etc.—will take place in spite of all stric tures against it. A proper recognition of the inescapable function of the sacred in human life is the only adequate protection against the havoc caused by its fierce distortions. Consequently, Tillich counsels a "waiting" for "salvation"—i.e., the healing of the separation and the organic union (not identification) of the ultimate depth-focus of life with its surface emptiness. The present situation is not the moment of healing, but the time in which the texture and meaning of one element—the profane—is being explored with greater fervor and energy than ever before in history. As we have seen, many of the secular theologians ask us to see this movement as the necessary development of human maturity. The par tial secularization and the partial sacralization of the world that was prominent in the past may now be viewed as a transitory stage of development that can be left without regret. Yet the younger theologians must make clearer whether they differ from Tillich as radically as they sometimes suggest. Do they really envisage with religious equanimity the total profanization of the world without its corresponding sacraliza tion as an alternate strain in the polyphony of full adulthood? Is it not true that the secular mandate must also be a profane burden to the religious heart that still aspires toward the holy center of existence? The coming of age of mankind may be a time in which his secular maturity is a pre-condition for a new religious adulthood whose final shape we now can only dimly see. In all cultures, the entrance into maturity has required an "initiation" that involved suffering, pain, and courage. Perhaps the serious encounter with Nietzsche's myth is one element in this process for Western man. Thus Tillich observes that "the sacred depth in things" cannot be "approached in ordinary ways." He suggests that perhaps our initiation into this reality will be accomplished by accepting the void which is the destiny of our period, by ac cepting it as a "sacred void" which may qualify and transform thinking and action. I have not tried to present a well-balanced W. RICHARD COMSTOCK 301</page><page sequence="38">synthesis between religion and secular culture. I have tried to show their one theonomous root and the void which necessarily has fol lowed their separation, and perhaps something of a longing for a new theonomy, for an ultimate concern in all our concerns.82 POSTSCRIPT By definition it is obvious that religious thought in transition does not stand still. An article attempting to pin down contemporary nuances in process is already behind "the times" as soon as written and hopelessly dated by the time it gets into print. Yet I hope that the issues I have noted are at least still recognizable. If I were writing the article now, the following corrections or additions of emphasis would be made. First, I have learned that Harvey Cox does not hold to the extreme rejection of "metaphysics" and "religion" that seemed to be suggested by some of his passages in The Secular City. I understand that a revised edi tion will qualify the rejection and make clear at least some senses in which secular metaphysics and religion are compatible with the secular city. Second, I now wish I had included some reference to the creative function that the "death of God" motif may play in the emerging dialogue between Eastern and Western religious traditions. To note only one example, the Buddhist cultivation of sunyatta or "emptiness" suggests intriguing affinities with Weil's "fidelity to the void." Altizer, of course, has been alert to this possibility and his discussions of the relation be tween Christian eschatology and Buddhism are one of the most interest ing parts of his thought. Third, I wish I had brought out more sharply that the resistance to "religion" by some of the younger theologians is directed against a dual ism somewhat different from the two metaphysical "worlds" that I have considered. Rather the attack is against "religion" as the espousal of two life spheres within the one cultural world. One of the major concerns of thinkers like Robinson, Hamilton and Cox is to reject the religious judgment that the secular world of technical achievement is alien to or in opposition to a sacred sphere of ultimate importance. These thinkers are calling us to a new "religious" or "Christian" style of life that is as much at ease with racing cars, television sets, and the Beatles as it is with majestic mountains, gothic cathedrals and the music of Bach. On a deeper level, it is the question of the new style of the technical "expert" trained to solve specific problems requiring a definite "know-how" that is con trasted with the more traditional style of the theological synthesist and his general "know-why." Still accepting metaphysics as an "OK" form of intellectual endeavor, I have been most interested in "world views," while these thinkers have been more concerned with "life styles" than my essay has indicated. I would still argue that the two are intimately related, but would now admit that the latter deserves more attention than I have given it. (See Cox, The Secular City, and William Hamilton, The New Essence of 302 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 196«</page><page sequence="39">Christianity, New York, Association Press, 1966). Finitude makes certain that we cannot do and say everything. Finally, I am convinced that a part of the intellectual task involved in dealing with the "event" of secularism is the achievement of greater semantic clarity in the use of terms. In the section on the "death of religion" I make some tentative suggestions on this point. Since then I have been impressed with some recent discussions among sociologists and anthropologists which I think are very helpful. (See Charles Y. Glock and Rodney Stark, Religion and Society, Chicago, Rand McNally &amp; Co., 1965, especially Chapter I; Milford E. Spiro, "Religion: Problems of Definition and Explanation," in Michael Banton, Anthropological Approaches to Religion, New York, Frederick A. Praeger, 1966, pp. 85-126.) Whereas my analysis suggests that the polar distinctions of sacred-profane, religious secular, holy-mundane are almost synonyms, sharper separation between the sacred-profane pole and the religious-secular might be more useful. According to this latter approach, religion refers to an orientation toward some kind of supernatural realm containing the Gods or a Higher Reality (e.g. Brahman). A secular society is one that has rejected such a super natural orientation in any form. However, such a society is not, by defi nition, necessarily a profane one. It might, as when the political or national life assumes the status of an ultimate concern, exhibit the char acteristics of a sacred society even while also being a predominantly secu lar one. As I see it, the task demanded of any further exploration of these issues is a more exact clarification of these obscure but important terms. ι Friedrich Nietzsche, Joyful Wisdom, trans.
