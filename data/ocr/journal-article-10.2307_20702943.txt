<plain_text><page sequence="1">132 MAORI AMULETS IN STONE, BONE AND SHELL. By H. D. Skinner. (A continuation of papers in Vols. 41-45.) THIS paper discusses a number of pendants which have recently become available and which throw new light on points raised in earlier papers. It must be admitted initially that the title of the series is open to criticism. Though it is probable that nearly all the pieces figured had mana derived from one source or another and hence are correctly termed "amulets" it is impossible to prove this for more than a very small fraction. And the use of the word "amulet" in the title has made it necessary to exclude an interesting group of pendants used solely in personal decoration. Reel-Shaped Beads. Fig. 168 represents a necklace of small reel-shaped beads cut with skill from human bone, found byj Mr. J. M. Gray on the surface of sand at Curio bay, south Otago. At the same site and presumably of the same age was a composite fish-hook with stone shank and bi perforate unbarbed point,1 also found by Mr. Gray. This association is of importance, as it confirms Roger Duff's record of a similar association, at the Wairau site. The careful exploration of this site is the most important piece of excavational work yet done in Polynesia. Duff has proved that reel-shaped beads belong to the earliest phase of human culture in the South Island and presumably in the rest of New Zealand, and has shown that the reel-shaped beads were associated, inter alia, with fish-hooks of the type just mentioned, with necklaces of porpoise-teeth and with necklaces of conventionalized renderings of cetacean teeth.2 Fig. 169 represents a group of reel-shaped beads in whale-ivory found on the surface of sand at Owenga, Chatham islands, associated with a necklace of porpoise-teeth and a necklace of imitation porpoise teeth. These beads were examined before the results of Duff's excavations were known and the flatness of the ends of the lowest bead then suggested a European saw. But since the ends of some of the Wairau moa-bone beads are just as flat, this Owenga group and its associated necklaces may now be accepted as Moriori. The Morioris also have pendants or necklaces in the form of conventionalized cetacean teeth.3 Fig. 170 represents part of a large reel-shaped bead in steatite from Waimea plain, Nelson, in the F. V. Knapp collection. The two deep drill-holes have failed to meet, and fracture was perhaps due to efforts to force a union. It is clear that these objects, whatever their material, were primarily beads. I believe that well-balanced stone examples were sometimes used secondarily as drill weights. Short land4 saw in action and figured a drill with two stones lashed to the 1. Type 4, Variety A of "Classification of the Fish-hooks of Murihiku," J.P.S., Vol. 51 (1942), p. 257, and Figs. 42-46. 2.

The great majority of holes drilled by Maori craftsmen, notably those in bone and ivory, required much finer balancing than was possible with small boulders however carefully selected. A stone bead would act ideally in such circum stances and several Maori informants have stated that stone beads were so used. Two at least of the informants were trustworthy and it seems to me unnecessary to reject their evidence. The technological point is of a small moment, but the attitude toward t Maori verbal evidence is important. Teeth as Pendants or Amulets. Fig. 171, from Native island, Stewart island, is the tooth of a strap-tooth whale. The rarity of this species of whale would be one factor in the interest aroused in the Maori community by the pendant. Fig. 172, from the same site, appears to be made from a back tooth of a sperm whale. The spiral grooving apparently follows the univalve motive. Fig. 173 indicates the type of cetacean tooth which may have been the model for the conventionalized cetacean tooth so strongly repre sented at the Wairau site, and so widely spread in Polynesia. It is from a specimen of orca gladiator, stranded at Riverton. Fig. 174, from Kaikai beach, is an example of the conventionalized cetacean tooth and was found immediately below the turf in circum stances suggesting no great antiquity though there was no evidence of European contact. Fig. 175 is an enigmatical form of which the site and circum stances of finding have not been recorded. The proximal notched ridge seems derived from the notched ridge of the reel-shaped beads. The notched or serrated edging is what is generally regarded as an archaic Maori feature, and is certainly wide spread in Polynesia. The two inconspicuous knobs seem to represent nipples. The distal end is carved to represent an animal head, apparently an eel's. On the flat proximal surface a mouth has been scraped below the two suspensory holes, thus conveying a second face. An interpretation of the meaning of this amulet will be possible only when a series of allied forms is available for study. Tongue-Shaped Amulets. Fig. 176 represents a pendant of this type from Orepuke, South land. The distal end is carved to represent a head apparently allied to that in the same position in the last figure, but suggests a shark rather than an eel. This type of ornament is frequently represented in the plates illustrating Cook's voyages, at which time it seems to have rivalled the hei tiki in popularity. Examples in museums purchased in recent years in the English market are all characterized by deep cutting of the proximal region, a feature not present in any of the examples secured from burial-caves, or by excavation, or in those drawn by Cook's draughtsmen. I formerly suggested that this type of amulet may have been derived from the shell-shank of the pa of Polynesia. This suggestion has not been strengthened by recent evidence. The Human-Headed Bird as Amulet. Fig. 177 represents a human-headed duck in whale bone from Chatham island, presented to the Dominion Museum by Miss Shand in 1896. The motive, which is a widely distributed one in Oceanic art,</page><page sequence="3">134 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY is still more convincingly rendered in a finely-executed patu in schist, from Kaingaroa, Chatham island.5 The same motive appears in Maori patu of the waha ika variety6 but so conventionalized that it has not yet won general acceptance. The Fish-S h aped Amulet. Fig. 178 represents a small fish, presumably a whitebait. The stone is a beautiful piece of inanga (whitebait) nephrite, a kind which the evidence of Heaphy shows to have been secured in western Muri hiku. When held to the light this amulet is seen to be the most convincing rendering possible of a whitebait. Amulets in Reptilian Form. Fig. 179 represents a lizard-shaped amulet in nephrite from sand hills near Castle point. Fig. 180, from Otanerua, Fanning bay, appears to represent a turtle. Fig. 181, in finely polished black argillite, from sandhills near the Whenuakura river, is serrated along the lateral edges and seems either a turtle or a realistic rendering of a turtle's carapace. Fig. 182, in paua shell from North Cape is perhaps a still further simplified rendering of the motive seen in Fig. 181. Amulets in the Form of Human Figures. Fig. 183 is an interesting human figure in whale ivory which was given by Poharama te Whiti, chief of Ngamotu people (Sugar-loaves, north Taranaki) to Arthur Bayly about the year 1854. It is recorded as worn either on the breast or suspended from the ear. Fig. 184, in steatite from Nelson, is a rendering of the human figure much more in the northern Maori convention than the last amulet. The buttock spiral is well and characteristically rendered. Fig. 185 represents a burnt and broken pendant in whale bone from Spirits bay, which may in its prime have been anthropomorphic. The "Chevroned Amulet". Allied forms from the Marquesas (Fig. 133)7 and S.E. New Guinea (Fig. 136)8 indicate that the oldest typologically of the New Zealand forms is that figured in Fig 121.9 Next in order of development among the pieces at present known is Fig. 124; the reason for the development of the median ridge is not apparent, nor why its bars should be rendered as concentric curves. The next stage is repre sented by the Whangamumu specimen (Fig. 125) in describing which Cheeseman applied to it the term "chevroned", and pointed out its relationship to the Kaitaia carving. For some unknown reason the motive rendered by the Kaitaia carving had hybridized with the motive of the amulet. But the chevron was not the sole character trans mitted from carving to amulet. Examples in later figures show that additional changes were due to the same cross-fertilization. If Fig. 188 is placed horizontally it suggests a many-legged animal. That this suggestion is intentional is indicated by the fact that the artist carver has added a non-utilitarian perforation to indicate the eye. 5. Bullet. . P. Bishop Museum, Vol. 9, Plate 30, a. 6.

If Fig. 126 is set horizontally on the same plane as Fig. 188, each facing outwards, they are seen to parallel the two outward facing terminal reptiles of the Kaitaia carving.10 What had legitimately been named "hands" in an earlier typological stage become reptilian dorsal spines in Fig. 126. If the Whangamumu pendant is now placed horizontally between them it will be seen that Cheesman's suggestion of relationship goes further than he supposed. Was the influence of the Kaitaia motive on this group of amulets a purely New Zealand development, or does it go back to an earlier period in the history of Polynesian culture? The presence of human figure and of reptile on the Marquesan pieces (Figs. 133, a and b) suggests strongly that the association belongs to a period anterior to Maori settlement in New Zealand. Fig. 186 represents one of a pair of chevroned amulets which the vendor stated were found in a bark-wrapped package in a hollow tree at Aniseed, near Kaikoura. If this description is accurate the pieces can hardly be ancient. On the other hand, no early explorer has recorded seeing them worn, and no Maori has ever recorded infor mation about them. The pair represented by Fig. 186 belong to the asymetrical variety of the type. Another pair of this variety (re presented by Fig. 188) from the same district, disproves my earlier suggestion11 that the variety originated at Otago peninsula. The chevrons of Fig. 186 have been modified so that they now appear to represent a series of human legs. That the artist-craftsman who carved this piece consciously aimed at rendering human legs is made probable by the amulet (Fig. 23) in whale ivory representing a human right-leg from the same district as Fig. 186. It is to be noted that the drill has been extensively used in making this amulet. Each of the "hands" along the left margin has been formed by drilling a pair of holes, each of which is linked with the margin by a slit. The "fingers" range in number downwards from six. The origin of the design of the asymmetrical variety would appear to be as follows. An amulet of the symmetrical variety resembling Fig. 12412 in all respects except that it had no bird carved on it, was laid on a horizontal surface. The median ridge, an arabesque of curves or chevrons, was theoretically split longitudinally and each half was then rotated outwards till it lay horizontal. The lateral ridges or expansions were rotated inward through 180? until they faced each other. The design of the asymmetrical pair was then complete. Fig. 187 shows how the pair of asymmetrical chevroned pendants were probably worn. To make this diagram a positive and negative drawing of Fig. 186 have been opposed and suspensory and bonding cords have been dotted in. Fig. 188 represents the two surfaces of one member of a pair of asymmetrical chevroned amulets in the possession of Mr. Ralph Parsons. They were found a little to the north of Kaikoura. One of the pair was too much weathered for any details of the design to have survived. The inner surface, in contact with the wearer's chest, is relatively plain, while the outer?on the left in Fig. 188?is fully elaborated. A notable decorative element is the line of notches, an archaic feature of Maori decorative art, but perhaps the most widely spread of decorative motives in Polynesia. 10.

Figs. 189 and 190 indicate that the crescent-motive, long recog nised on the top of the Maori ko (cultivating implement), was used also as an amulet. Best was keenly interested in the motive and wrote about it at some length but could not secure much Maori information. He says:13 "The upper end of the implement, for perhaps six to eight inches, is carved into a curious crescent form, termed whakamarama or whakaaurei both of which terms describe its shape. It is said to be an extremely ancient form". He could figure "no good specimen of the common form of crescent-shaped whakamarama, of which I have seen many on the East Coast of the North Island and in the Bay of Plenty district in past years. . . . The crescent was of old the symbol of fertility because it represented the fertilising moon, and here, at the end of the earth, the Maori carved the crescent on the upper end of his spade shaft". In spite of Best's statement, several good crescents are figured by him, for example, Fig. 27A, Fig. 24 (lower row, Nos. 1, 2, 3), and Fig. 28. Fig. 189 is in the Wanganui Museum. When I first saw it, it was in the collection of Dr. Alfred Newman who told me that it represented the crescent moon and was the emblem of fertility. His authority for these statements was probably Best. He further stated that the piece was Moriori in origin. He did not specify what he meant by "Moriori", and it is probable that he was using the word loosely to designate a hypothetical ancient period in Maori history.14 The serrated outline should be noted. Fig. 190 is a broken specimen from Ruggedy, Stewart island, a district too cold for cultivation of the kumara and therefore a district where the ko was not used. It would appear that the crescent was so completely associated with the ko, in the Maori mind, that it could not be rendered by itself, but must be shown capping a shaft. Disc-Shaped Pendant. Fig. 191 is a greenstone disc pendant resembling Figs. 163-16715 except that it has two perforations in place of one. It was given, together with Fig. 183, by Poharama te Whiti, of the Ngamotu hapu, to Arthur Bayly about 1854 and was described as worn either from the ear or on the breast. Figures.
