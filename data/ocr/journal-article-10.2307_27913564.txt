<plain_text><page sequence="1">BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH: DIVINE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE IN THE BOOK OF EZEKIEL. By John F. Kutsko. Bibli cal and Judaic Studies from the University of California, San Diego 7. Pp. xiv + 185. Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2000. Cloth, $29.50. This is a book about the theology of Ezekiel in response to the exile. But since there are many books on that problem, the author has focused in this study on the role the Babylonian cult of images plays in understanding Ezekiel's particular outlook on the relation of Israel's god to the exiles. He works with three major sources of current interest: (1) the growing con sensus that the Book of Ezekiel is a literary whole, and in its material and composition does largely reflect the situation of the prophet and the exiles; (2) recent studies on the influence of Akkadian literary works (such as the Erra Epic) on the language of the prophets; and (3) a substantial body of Akkadian descriptions of the creation, care and cultic understanding of statues made to represent the gods. He judges that the book was written as a coherent whole and made use of earlier Israelite traditions found in the Bible, but that it was composed in a Mesopotamian setting.</page><page sequence="2">Hebrew Studies 42 (2001) 347 Reviews He identifies the crucial issue for Israel in exile as the question of God's presence or absence, especially in view of the plethora of visual images of the gods which made these divinities so present to their worshippers. How could Israel defend its God without an image? Did this make God different from pagan gods really? And how could that God relate to his people in an exilic situation? These questions raised for the exiles the larger theological issues of theodicy ("Why did God allow defeat?") and theophany ("Where is God? Can God be here?") and theonomy ("Is God powerless against these gods?"). The answers to these questions form the three major chapters of this study. Throughout, the prophet and his followers clearly worked from Israel's aniconic tradition that God should not and cannot be delineated by any image, and that as a result God cannot be limited (contained) by a statue or a temple or a land. Indeed, Ezekiel declares God to be more pro foundly present in the absence of an image when Israel recognizes instead the divine power at work behind the present tragic events. Psalm 115 can declare that idols have eyes but see not, and if asked in turn, "Where is our God?" can answer, "God is in the heavens, he does whatever he wills." This is very like Ezekiel who crafts a similar response around three major mo tifs that recur structurally through the whole book: the rejection and re building of the temple, the appearance of the divine tm, and an extended polemic against idols. Kutsko begins with exploring the theodicy question of idol making and idolatry in Ezekiel's thought. The prophet employs ubbi and wxipv as dis tinctive terms for statues in his polemic against idolatry and never calls the statues or their gods by the usual term dtt^k. His polemic clearly suggests that he believed idol worship played a role in Israel's defeat, in contrast to some of the contemporary interpretation of the Deuteronomists. After a further in-depth analysis of the terms nbx (image) and moi (likeness) in Ezekiel, Kutsko concludes Ezekiel, in agreement with Genesis, saw not statues but humans as the images of God. A last line of evidence is that Ezekiel often names violence (oon) and bloodshed (en -|s ) as causes of the exile, and this comports with the argument of Gen 9 that humans are not to shed blood because they are in the image of God. For Ezekiel, idolatry is the primary cause of Israel's fate. The second section of the book deals with the theology of divine pres ence in the tm as it is known in the Priestly traditions of the Pentateuch and in Ezekiel. tm language is always non-anthropomorphic, but usually associated with the tent tradition or the temple. Ezekiel emphasizes the mo bility of God's presence in the great scenes of God's tm abandoning the temple of Jerusalem in Ezek 8-11, and its return in chapter 43. But more significantly, Ezekiel fashions God's available presence to the exiles in be tween. God is the sanctuary for the exilic community (see the expression</page><page sequence="3">Hebrew Studies 42 (2001) 348 Reviews cor? enpo in 11:16) and this continued presence is a further polemic against any form of trust in idols in the lands of captivity. The final section is devoted to showing how common descriptions of de feat, capture and exile in Akkadian literature often feature the treatment of the statues of the gods that were captured in battle. Several features stand out, including the arguments that the gods who were captured abandoned their people over their sins, and that the gods returned when their temples were restored, and that in preparation, their statues must be reborn, re newed or re-created. If the statue is the image of god in these works, and for Israel the person is God's image, then Ezekiel's use of the Mesopota mian literary motifs is seen transformed in his application of their language to the cleansing of Israel and its rebirth and renewal in chapters 36-37. Thus God is made present not in idols but in the purging of their sin and uncleanness and their restoration from exile. Kutsko's gathering of the Mesopotamian idol texts and his analysis of the language of idolatry in light of them proves very helpful in identifying many of the images and motifs employed by Ezekiel, and in confirming the overall importance of the theme of God's absence and presence as questions of theodicy and theonomy for Ezekiel. Kutsko supports and strengthens the conviction that the book is very highly organized, literarily sophisticated and largely a coherent reflection of the Exilic period itself. He concentrates on the visual perhaps too exclusively (the "glory", land, temple, idols) and shortchanges somewhat the overwhelming dominance of the Word of God that enacts what it proclaims. The author recognizes the power of the prophetic word in the structure of the book, but naturally concentrates on his special contribution. However, it is important to consider that the strongest argument in Ezekiel's war to maintain the allegiance of the exiles to their own God was that what God spoke, God did. Even more than the emptiness of idols, it is for Ezekiel the direction and shape of God's control of history that reveals the power and presence of God. When all the divine decrees have taken place, as the last verse of the book asserts, then God will be fully present to Israel once again.
