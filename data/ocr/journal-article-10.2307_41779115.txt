Birds, faces, fruits, animals - the whole pantheon of Moche pottery themes stood on their living room shelf, where his father would place the perfectly preserved vessels he and his buddies dug up. "Everyone had a few pots in his house. They were nice decorations," says Becerra. But sometime around 1990, all that changed. "It became a business," he recalls. "Outsiders came. They came from the city, and you'd see them out in the hills digging up everything they could find. They'd take it all away and sell it." And so the modern looting industry came to little Ucupe and a hundred villages like it up and down the coast of northern Peru. People who used to excavate pots as back-lot hobby or family activity at Holy Week, as much a part of local social life as fishing or football, watched first with bafflement and then anger as pro- fessional grave robbers descended on their lands to search for pieces to supply the international market for Peruvian antiquities. Poor, neglected, hurt by the fall of sugar prices, these villages suddenly found themselves living literally on top of a commodity hotter than sugar ever was: Moche ceramics from the first millen- www.archaeology.org 43</page><page sequence="3">The Brüning Museum warehouse is filled with Moche and Chimú ceramics excavated by archaeolo- gists, seized by patrols, or donated by guilt-stricken collectors.

Now Becerra is the leader of his village s grupo de pro- tección arqueológica y or la grupa, a citizens' patrol armed with binoculars, a dirt bike, one revolver, and one shotgun but whose most important weapon is the eyes and ears of people living in the villages adobe houses. The brigades mission is to stop people from occupying the land and plundering what lies beneath it. The patrol chases away bands of looters, or surrounds them, seizes their tools - shovels, poles, buckets - and ties up their wrists with rope until the police come. Walter Alva, director of the new Museum of the Royal Tombs of the Lord of Sipán in the town of Lambayeque, 30 miles north of Ucupe, organized eight such patrols in the early 1990s in response to the phenomenal growth of commercial looting in the Moche heartland. In doing so, he took a cue from rural Perus long tradition of ragtag peasant militias known as rondas campesinas , which have fought scourges ranging from cattle rustlers to Shining Path Maoist guerrillas. This time the enemy was looters prospecting for ancient art, and it was ironically Alva s own 1987 excavation of the tombs at Sipán that helped inspire the plundering. On February 6 of that year, looters digging at Sipán's burial mound, or huaca , struck a tomb where a Moche lord had been buried around A.D. 300. They carried out about a dozen rice sacks full of gold and silver artifacts, somewhere between 200 and 300 objects in all, and smashed or dis- carded hundreds more either inadvertently or because they didn't think they were good enough to sell. Police stopped the pillage and notified Alva, who, under constant harass- ment from townspeople who wanted to ransack the site, began excavating where the looters had left off. He found a dozen more tombs, two as rich in artifacts as the looted one. Alva's excavations brought new insights into the social complexity of the Moche, who ruled the north coast from about a.D. 100 to 700. Meanwhile the looted artifacts had already hit the mar- ket, whetting the appetite of collectors as never before. Once an exotic niche product, Peruvian artifacts became almost overnight one of the hottest items in the international antiquities trade. "It was a gold rush," recalls Alva. "It's been a constant struggle against loot- ers ever since." More has been destroyed in Peru in the past 40 years than in the previous 400, he claims. I and had I wanted his come followers to to see ÚcuPE if were what because doing Alva I wanted to see if what Alva and his followers were doing was actually effective in stop- ping the rampant looting. Archaeologist Carlos Wester, who helped Alva and Alva's late wife, Susana Meneses, develop the patrols and is now acting director of the Brüning National Archaeological Museum in Lambayeque, led me to the top of an unmolested 1,800-year-old Moche huaca less than a mile from Ucupe. As such mounds go it was pretty small, maybe three stories high, overlooking the algarrobo trees, grazing goats, and the village in the distance. "The patrols have really worked, said Wester. It you come here to loot, they'll chase you out before the police even get here. People have become aware of the value of preserv- ing the huacas. Inside this one, there are probably some good things. Someday we'll excavate it, but until we do it's well protected." In Ucupe, Wester intro- duced me to Becerra and another patrol leader, Gilberto 44 Archaeology • January/February 2003</page><page sequence="4">The landscape in northern Peru is littered with human bones and pockmarked with holes left by looters looking for artifacts, like these Moche ceramics. Citizens' brigades are help- ing to halt this destruction, so that Peru's artifacts stay in the country and, ideally, in the ground. A Chavin-era wall, dating from about 200 b.c., was excavated in the 1980s. It was later reburied to protect its priceless murals from the elements. Patrols now guard it from pillagers, who would cut it up and sell the pieces to dealers in Lima. ! S i i s 3 3 3 S •Č3 y I I Z Jf c I www.archaeology.org 45 Romero. I returned by bus a few days later to see the patrol in action. The road to Ucupe passed through a moonscape of barren hills before reaching the lazy Zaña River where the women of Ucupe were washing clothes while children splashed among water lilies and goats nibbled weeds by the banks. The village itself is a collection of single-story brick and adobe houses along the main road; dirt streets lead away through farms and sand dunes to the Pacific coast a few miles away. Romero met me at the bus stop. A man with a gravelly voice and a sleepy smile, his manner was so mild that I was surprised to learn he doubled as a security guard for the local sugar cooperative and, as such, was licensed to carry a gun. He is the only member of the patrol who regularly carries a weapon, although he told me that he had never shot directly at looters. "This isn't war," he said. Becerra, Romero, and I hired a motorcycle fitted with a passenger seat wide enough for the three of us. With a young driver named Julio, we bumped along a rutted dirt road past fields of spicy red pepper plants and sugar cane. Now and then Romero would point out a bare hill and explain that it was not a hill. It was another huaca , weathered by many centuries of wind and sun. "We have virgin huacas , never been touched and known only to us," said Romero, shouting above the sound of the engine. The Ucupe grupa was cre- ated in July 1994, Romero told me. "There are about 20 of us active in the grupa , but direct- ly or indirectly I would say 90 percent or the people in the town collaborate with us. There are always a few who still want to dig up pots to sell, but we keep an eye on them. If we see somebody looting, we call the [Brüning] museum, and it calls the police. If the police can t get here fast enough, we hold them our- selves. A month ago we detained three looters and their tools. We let down our guard for an hour and before we knew it they were digging. Its like that here. You go to lunch and you come back, and there they are, digging. Its always people from outside, mostly from Cayalti." The market town of Cayalti, with a population of about 10,000, lies 12 miles northeast of Úcupe. It is built around a rambling, wooden plantation mansion with peeling yel- low paint. In the late 1960s, a left-wing government con- fiscated the house and the surrounding sugar plantations and turned them over to a workers' cooperative. Thirty years later the cooperative went bankrupt, and residents say the town has been struggling ever since. "No jobs here. Nothing to do," said a young man in the town square. Cayalti is known throughout the region as a looting cen- ter, a town where plundered antiquities are bought and sold with impunity. Its a busy town of woodworking shops and stands selling pirated videos, where fruit sellers and prosti-</page><page sequence="5">The northern town of Cayalti is a hub of the looting trade, where carpentry shops are ffonts for antiquities sellers and a taxi stand serves as a distribution center.

The international art market's demand for ancient textiles has caused an escalation of looting in southern Peru. A detail from a textile from a Paracas necropolis, dating from around 600 to 200 B.c., depicts a deity known as the "oculate being." He holds a trophy-headed snake, and his legs are flanked by two birds.

One day as Wester and I drove into town, he pointed to two men walking beside a horse-drawn cart. "The older one, hes been arrested sever- al times for looting," he said. "We know who he is." Social hierarchy in Cayalti is no longer based on sugar but on loot, with grimy tomb-diggers at the bottom, small- time dealers above them, and at the top, antiquities traders who sell to Peruvian and occasionally European collectors who come to town to buy. Two carpentry shops serve as fronts for the antiquities business. A taxi stand at the edge of town is known as a distribution center. I wandered alone through Cayalti, posing as a buyer and asking around for antigüedades. It didn't take long before a dealer led me to an alley behind his house, where he offered me point-bottomed Inka pots, a broken Moche portrait vessel, and an exquisite little ceramic jar no bigger than a perfume bottle in the shape of a spondylus seashell. All freshly dug up, he told me. (I bought an Inka pot and the broken portrait vessel for the equivalent of $3 each and took them to Alva at the National Museum in Lima, where he confirmed they were authentic. I donated them to the museum.) The dealer wanted to know if I was a museum director. Like loot sellers everywhere, he boasted that he sold his best pieces to museums. The son of the late owner of Lima s Gold Museum, he told me, occasionally came to town in a big black car to see what he had to offer. The hills outside Cayalti are pockmarked with holes left by looters and strewn with human bones, empty water bottles, and worthless bits of ancient textile. "Aquí todo el pueblo huaquea" (everybody loots here), the dealer told me, including the former president of Cayaltis sugar cooperative, who was arrested in 1996 along with four other men for looting. The people of Ucupe speak with disgust about places like Cayalti. "No respect for their ancestors," an Ucupe woman told me as we waited for a bus. Archaeologists and the brigade have made the people of Ucupe more aware of their cultural heritage. "When I was a boy, people knew nothing about the importance of these objects we found," said Becerra. "We didn't know what the pre- Columbian cultures were. Moche, Chimú, Chavin, we'd never heard those names. Now everyone knows them. They teach them to the children in school." Ucupe and Cayalti are also divided by a bitter land feud. Farmers in tranquil Ucupe fear that Cayalti people will descend on their lands and then petition a judge for legal title. Whole towns are born this way in Peru. Squatters take over idle private land by the light of the moon, and months or years later they ask that their settlement be incorporated as a town. "People come from Cayalti saying they want to work on the farms," said Romero. "Some of them have family members here. But to us, everyone who comes from Cayalti is a looter." Becerra added, "We have extinguished looting in this area, because after the looters come the cattle rustlers, the thieves, and the land invaders. All the bad elements." Some 350 people are now actively involved in the brigades. Alva calculates they have seized about 3,200 objects from looters. He also knows their efforts have pushed the problem elsewhere. Partly because of police and grupa pressure, and partly because the tastes of international collectors have changed, the professionals are moving south. Archaeology • January/February 2003</page><page sequence="6">Peru's looting industry began to thrive in the 1980s after thieves hit Sipán's rich Moche tombs. Among the hundreds of gold and silver artifacts taken was this mask. 1 1 With less police presence and no citizens' patrols, looters in the south have more freedom to raid burial mounds in search of prized textiles. To find the tombs, they plunge metal poles in the sand. If the pole suddenly meets no resistance, they've hit the inside of a pot, probably within a tomb, where they hope to find textiles wrapping the remains of the dead. rri 1 !

In Italy he would be a tombarolo , in Guatemala an estelero; in Peru he's a htmquero, a professional grave robber who has been digging up tombs almost every night since his early teens. He loves his job and lives in a small brick house with his wife and two daughters in a town north of Lima. He earns a little money on the side driving a taxi. Robin and his buddies now work mostly in the Cañete area south of Lima, where there are no citizens' patrols, less police interference, and abundant ancient textiles of the kind that bring big bucks on the international art mar- ket - $10,000 for good ones, a quarter of a million for the very best. I met Robin and his colleagues through a collec- tor friend. It took some persuading but he finally agreed to take me along on a nighttime raid. I told him I wouldn't buy anything or join in the digging. I just wanted to watch and take notes. They agreed. We met late in the afternoon and took a bus south. There were four of us: Robin, two other looters named Remi and Harry, and me, a 39-year-old American reporter who drew a lot of stares as we crowded onto the bus with armfuls of shovels and tools. We got out at an empty stretch of highway some 80 miles south of Lima and walked for nearly an hour across cotton fields illuminated by moonlight. A few dogs barked but we encountered no one as we walked. Eventually we came to a tree. Sitting on its gnarled roots, we chewed coca leaves. About 100 feet away rose the Inka- era huaca they were about to assault. The looters drank cane liquor and talked about strange and beautiful things they had found over the years - perfect- ly preserved pots, color-spangled weavings, piles of human bones and skulls. Robin told of a weaving that bore the image of a huge condor with outstretched wings. They also talked about the fickle spirits of the dead.

"If you act greedy, the huaca won't give you anything," said Robin. 'You take too much, and it will close up and never give you anything again." "But it warns you," added Remi. "When the coca leaf tastes sweet, the huaca is about to give you something." The looters particularly liked this huaca; it was relatively untouched, and they knew, having dug into it before, that the tombs within were not too deep. But, unusual for the south coast, there was some police presence here. Police had chased them away before, and Robin only barely escaped arrest one night at a burial site in the area. They told me the ground rules: no flash pictures (the flash might attract police), make as little noise as possible, and if you must talk, whisper. I followed them to the huaca and sat on the chalky surface as they began their work. Shaped like a kidney, it stood about 40 feet high and stretched a quarter of a mile end to end. First they plunged metal poles into its smooth, bald surface to locate tombs. When they hit nothing but sand, they moved on. If the pole suddenly met no resistance, that meant they had hit an empty pot, probably within a tomb. And if the pole made a certain muffled crack, that meant they had hit human remains. The excruciating crack of metal hitting bone made me recoil. After an hour of sinking their poles and making mental notes of where they had hit bodies, they began to dig - fast. In 1 5 minutes, they excavated a hole six feet deep; in half an hour, they had broken into tombs ten feet down. These seemed to belong to Inka commoners, simple graves with gourds containing peanuts or bird bones, woven bags, and coils of string. There were knitting instru- Illegal Today ; Legal Tomorrow People paradoxically, looted Peru to often artifacts. loot? The its ask, That answer not isn't illegal contradiction it is illegal yes. to But, own in Peru to loot? The answer is yes. But, paradoxically, its not illegal to own looted artifacts. That contradiction has been the Peruvian collecting industry's legal salvation for more than a century. Destruction of archaeological sites has been nominally illegal in Peru since a govern- ment decree in 1893. With thousands of sites all over the country, enforcement was almost nonexistent until the 1980s and since then has been uneven at best. Enforcement, such as it is, falls almost entirely on the looters. It is illegal for them to dig up artifacts, transport them or sell them. In the eyes of the state, they are criminals. Not so for collectors. Although it is technically illegal to buy looted arti- facts, a collector need only "register" his pieces with the governments National Institute of Culture (INC) in order to gain legal title to them. A pot held by a loot- er and considered stolen property today can be perfect- ly legal tomorrow, once the buyer obtains his INC regis- tration. Its a system designed to protect wealthy investor-collectors while punishing the looters who sup- ply them, a system that collectors are keen to preserve. By allowing collectors to launder their collections through the INC, the Peruvian state essentially becomes an agent in the destruction of its own heritage. The only restriction is that collectors may not legally export ancient pieces. Its as if it were a crime to grow coca leaf but perfectly legal to snort cocaine. - R.A. 48 Archaeology • January/February 2003</page><page sequence="8">Úcupe's patrol looks for signs of recent looting.

I looked at all this in the moonlight, fasci- nated, disgusted and saddened. They couldn't sell this stuff, and they were throwing it into heaps of debris. "We know what people are buying and what they don't want," said Robin. "We leave a lot of stuff because we can't sell it. It's hard to sell ceramics these days. Too much of it is on the market. These days buyers want textiles and more textiles." They often get specific requests relayed from collectors through middlemen - customized looting. Within a few hours they had ripped into half a dozen tombs and the remains of adults and children who had lain together for 500 years were scat- tered all over the huaca. The looters grasped human skulls by the hair and chucked them out like basketballs. They shoveled out bones, some with bits of desiccated human tissue still attached. At about 4 a.m. they found what they wanted - an Inka weaving. At the bottom of a hole nine feet deep, using a flashlight, they could see the fabric wrapped around a bun- dle that surely contained human remains. In the light they could see the deep red and ocher of the fabric. "Look at those colors! We've got a good one," said Robin. "I'm going to dig around the sides, carefully so as not to damage the weaving. If you rip it out, you'll destroy it." Another half-hour of digging and he pulled the weaving free and clambered out of the pit. He held it up to the flashlight and shook it, releas- ing a cloud of dust. It was indeed a lovely piece, a design of red, yellow, blue, and beige diamonds. It was a shirt, almost perfectly intact, with a hole for the head and two for the arms. It probably belonged to a boy or a young man. The bones of the body it had wrapped lay at the bottom of the pit: a femur, a spine, a skull gazing up at the stars. "This is the best thing we've found in two weeks," said Robin. They were all the more lucky because the pole had not pierced the fabric. They gathered their tools and put the weaving in a knapsack. As we walked back across the fields, they anxiously discussed how much money the textile might bring them. A thousand dollars, maybe $1,500.

Back in the small house where Remi lived, the men spread out the weaving on the dirt floor. They were tired but excit- ed as they made calls with Robin's cell phone to find a buyer. By 9 a.m., they had one, a smuggler they knew only as Lucho, and asked him to come see it. "Believe me, it's a good piece, una belleza ," said Robin. "We're not going to bring you all the way down here for something that's not worth it." That was when I had to leave. I could not be present at the deal because Lucho might not like it. Would he be armed? I asked. No, he does not carry a weapon, but he is an important buyer and might feel uncomfortable having someone he doesn't know present, Robin explained. The looters told me later that they asked for $1,500, but Lucho bargained them down to $1,000. The weaving would be on a plane out of Peru within days. I had asked the looters how they felt about digging up bodies. "When you first start doing this, it makes you ner- vous," Remi said. "Digging up bones, you think you're going to incur a curse. But after a while it becomes easy. You don't even think about it." "But," I inquired, "doesn't it bother you personally? I mean, how would you like it if someone dug up your grave and stole everything your family had put in it?" They looked at each other nervously, and then at me as if suddenly they wished I weren't there. Then Remi said, "Around here there is no other kind of work." ■ Roger Atwood is a journalist writ- ing on the antiquities trade with a fel- lowship from the Alicia Patterson Foundation .
