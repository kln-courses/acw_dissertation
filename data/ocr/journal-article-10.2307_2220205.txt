As John Lucas explains in the introduction to his new book, the work is based on lectures given to first year students reading Physics and Philosophy and Mathematics and Philosophy at Oxford. The topics covered provide the major conceptual back- ground to classical physics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are only mentioned in</page><page sequence="2">454 BOOK REVIEWS passing. They are dealt with in the second and third year respectively of the Oxford programme in Philosophy of Physics. The book begins with an introductory chapter entitled "The Principles of Natural Philosophy" in which Lucas assesses the rationalist and empiricist tendencies in the philosophy of physics. He reject a priori deductive rationalism on the grounds of the logical contingency of the physical world, but he also argues against radical empiri- cism, that we can know nothing over and above what is given to us in actual experience. For example Lucas admits the cogency of some inductive arguments, and this leads to a brief discussion of Popper and falsifiability. This passage is somewhat perplexing. He says Popper cannot explain why physicists look for universally quantified laws rather than existentially quantified propositions. But that is exactly what Popper does explain in terms of falsifiability by singular observation statements. Lucas also says Popper's methodology is refuted by the history of physics. It is not perhaps clear that a normative methodology can be refuted by descriptive proposi- tions. But Lucas does allow that Popper is correct in stressing the "theory-ladenness" of observations and this provides further powerful arguments against radical empiri- cism. The book continues with a chapter on induction. Lucas argues that the acceptance of inductive arguments is a necessary condition for the possibility of rational dis- course. Of course this presupposes acceptance of uniformities or regularities in nature, captured by causal relationships or more general types of natural law. It is just at this point that well-rehearsed circularity enters, the justification for such presup- positions is itself induction. Lucas seems to skirt round this circularity, stressing that inductive arguments are not watertight. In a nice turn of phrase he remarks (p. 23) "To be invulnerable is to be invincibly ignorant". But Lucas admits his argumen- tation will not satisfy everyone and in the end proceeds to fall back on the familiar pragmatic argument, one may be better off and certainly cannot be worse off by following an "inductive policy". The next two chapters are devoted to introducing one of the major themes of the book, the nature of causality. Physicists are generally less concerned with causality than most philosophers suppose. Let me first discuss briefly why this is so. Physical systems, be they particles or fields, in general change their state with the passage of time. Law-like regularities govern these changes of state, correlating deterministi- cally or probabilistically, the state at some time tl with the state of a later time t2. Schematically (*) State at t1 + Laws of Nature = State at t2 Where does the causal story come in? Is the state at t1 the cause of the state at t2? But causes are invoked to explain the change of state. They must be something over and above the state itself. Well, could we identify the laws of nature with the cause? But the laws just state the regularity. Again the cause is supposed to explain it, so it cannot be identified with the law it is supposed to explain. So there does not seem to be any room for causes in the physicist's account of change as expressed in (*). The notion of cause is really an anthropomorphic one arising from the possibility of interfering with the natural course of events. But if the agency of interference is some other physical system, then the total system develops in time in accordance with</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 455 natural law, and once again causation (in the sense of Aristotelean efficient cause at any rate) drops out of the picture. So what is left of causal connection and causal mechanism? To the physicist all that really remains are causalprocesses, a succession of states governed by a particular sort of law of nature, in which localized structures are "propagated" in a spatiotemporal continuous fashion from one part of space at one time to another part of space at a later time. It is sometimes argued that the only genuinely explanatory natural laws are those governing causal processes, what we may term causal laws. The reason for this appears to be that the only changes we can understand are those arising from contact or contiguous action. But again the understanding claimed seems to arise from analogizing the pushes and pulls with which human beings directly manipulate (i.e. interfere with) the natural world. The point I am driving at is that one cannot explain natural laws in terms of causal mechanisms, since causal mechanisms are just a special case of natural law. I do not think Lucas would quarrel with anything I have just said. It is quite true that in classical physics there is a privileged status accorded to causal laws, mainly arising from metaphysical objections to action-at-a-distance as a comprehensible mode of explanation. It is therefore quite proper that Lucas should place particular emphasis on the careful elucidation of causal laws. Lucas lists five characteristic features of a causal relation: (1) necessary (2) weakly antecedent (i.e. the cause must not occur later than the effect) (3) repeatable (4) explicable (5) "contiuous" The last condition is ambiguous as between contiGuous and contiNuous. Lucas argues that Humean contiguity should really be construed as continuity in under- standing properly the role of causality in the philosophy of physics. It is through this idea of continuous connection that the concept of causality links with the concepts of space and time. In the next chapter, entitled "'Contiuity' and the A Priori", Lucas examines the ordering relations appropriate to space and time. For example does time exhibit a discrete ordering or a dense ordering or does it have the order-type of the linear continuum? Such questions cannot be answered by empirical means, but Lucas argues cogently that that does not mean that such questions cannot be the subject of substantive rational discussion. Introducing continuous magnitudes leads to a useful chapter on the principles of measurement. Lucas then turns his attention to questions of invariance and sym- metry as a natural extension of the idea of constancy. Invariants are just those features of a situation which do not change under some given class of transforma- tions. Lucas takes the opportunity to introduce mathematical ideas of group theory which arise so naturally in this connection. He gives a somewhat idiosyncratic account of covariance under which scalar invariants are classified as covariant. He continues with a discussion of the homogeneity of time and the homogeneity and isotropy of space expressed by their symmetry under the relevant displacement and rotation groups, and considers the relevance of this to arguments concerning absolute</page><page sequence="4">456 BOOK REVIEWS and relational theories of space and time. Lucas considers this a "paradigm example of a philosophical problem". In the following chapter on "Reflections, Relationism and Parity" Lucas comes down against relationism with familiar arguments on the status of incongruous counterparts that go back to Kant, but can now be stated in more precise mathematical language involving the global topological property of orientability. In the course of discussing the absolute-relational controversy Lucas has some interesting comments on Sufficient Reason and the Identity of Indiscern- ibles. On p. 130 there is a curious confusion about Leibniz's law in formal logic which Lucas says presupposes that "it is logically impossible for two individuals to be indiscernible from each other". What he surely means is "it is logically impossible for two identicals to be discernible"! The vexed question of whether the Identity of Indiscernibles is exemplified or contradicted in quantum mechanics is given brief discussion. Lucas claims that there are arguments for both views. On the one hand we can have two photons in exactly the same state, which argues against Leibniz, while, says Lucas, for two photons in different states, exchanging the photons does not lead to a new state, which arguesfor Leibniz. But the second argument presumes that two photons can be in different states. Taking account of the necessity to symmetrize the total state vector for the two photons makes this point a rather delicate one. The individual photons in a symmetrized state are not themselves in pure states at all, so the question of whether they are in the same pure state does not arise. However they are in the same improper mixed state, so from this point of view the fact that permutation of the particles does not change the state is a case not of the identity of indiscernibles, but of the identity of identicals! Lucas continues with two chapters on causal cords and fields. Causal cords arise when a finite set of continuous state variables change their values in a continuous way with lapse of time. For example we can think of these state variables as defining the location of the representative point of some mechanical system in an appropriate phase space. The causal cords are the possible continuous trajectories through this phase space parameterized by lapse of time, or alternatively they can be thought of as curves in the space of state variables-and-time. Causal cords are examples then of the causal processes we referred to earlier. As Lucas remarks such a cord "can be considered in as many steps as we please, but does not demand to be resolved into steps at all". At this point Lucas interpolates a Thought (p. 166). Under what circumstances would a system return almost to its original condition? It is not clear whether this is an exercise for the student or a plea for enlightenment on the part of the author! In either case the Poincare Recurrence Theorem provides a partial answer. (For a system confined to a bounded energy hypersurface the set of conditions for which recurrence does not hold is at most of measure zero). The idea of causal cords shows in a very natural way how differential equations arise in physics. Further generalization to an infinite number of state variables leads to the notion of a field in which each point of physical space is assigned a "field value", which might be just a scalar or a more general type of tensor. Fields are used in classical physics to mediate interaction in an explicable way between material particles. Lucas stresses that fields may well be accorded the same ontological status as the particles them- selves, and should not necessarily be regarded as insubstantial mathematical fictions. In a brief final chapter entitled "Continuity and Beyond" Lucas points the way to</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 457 relativity and quantum mechanics with just sufficient detail to whet the appetite of the reader. Taken as a whole the book gives a very fair coverage of just the right sort of material for the intended reader. Oxford undergraduates who attended the original lectures were privileged indeed, but the publication of the book should serve to open up the subject of philosophy of physics to a wider audience. It is the prerogative of the reviewer to prove his industry by detecting slips. I will end with two. On p. 4 it is claimed that the Special Theory of Relativity was originally based on the negative result of the Michelson-Morley experiment. But this experiment is not referenced in Einstein's 1905 paper, and it is a contentious historical issue whether, at that time, he was even aware of it. On p. 180 we are told that if F is a vector, then curl F is also a vector. That may be all right for physicists but is not good enough for philosophers or mathematicians. Curl F is the dual of a second-rank antisymmetric tensor, i.e. a pseudo-vector. King's College London MICHAEL REDHEAD</page></plain_text>
