It is a privileged medium through which these spirits reveal their wishes and conditions their willingness to assure the community's well-being. On the human side, in order to be possessed an 'opening of the mind' is requested and needs to be activated through collective song-dance performances that recall the flowing motions of the spirits' water world and convey the longing for this maternal universe. As a cri tique of the predominant use of the term 'agency' in reference to autonomy and resistance, this paper adheres to a context-based view that relies on the way the actors experience the phenom enon. In line with the Punu reality this paper considers receptivity, in its ambivalent link to suf fering, as the main source of the power these possessions grant to women. Keywords possession trance, water spirits, receptivity, maternal, Punu, Congo-Brazzaville Introduction Women's worldwide predominance in possession-trance cults has frequently been interpreted in anthropological literature as inversely relational to their inferior position in society. In generalizing his observations on zar possession in Somalia, loan Lewis maintained that these largely female cults, which he termed 'peripheral', are the result of women acting against their subordinai positions and seem to be 'thinly disguised protest movements directed against the dominant sex' (1971, 32). It is through their spirits that women manipu late men and obtain influence in a social life that is otherwise denied to them. Thus these cults play 'a significant role in the sex war in traditional societies and cultures where women lack more obvious and direct means for forward ing their aims' (Lewis 1971, 31). The idea that possession trances help to readjust power imbalances between the sexes has been recently restated by © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011 DOI: 10.1163/157006611X599181</page><page sequence="2">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 367 Erika Bourguignon, who argues that 'for women, possession trance constitutes a psychodynamic response to powerlessness by providing them a means for the gratification of wishes ordinarily denied to them' (2004, 557). Acting out the identity of spirits while in a possession trance offers women an acceptable way of expressing thoughts and feelings that are forbidden in situations of social subordination (Bourguignon 2004). Scholars researching African possession cults have questioned the idea that these cults only entail a temporary redress of power imbalances by emphasiz ing the real gain of status afforded to women. According to Marion Kilson, among the Ga in Ghana it is through spirit mediumship that women who are childless and have very low social position 'transform their status inferiority into the most powerful of all vocations' (1972, 177). In her historical survey on possession cults in the interlacustrine and Nyamwezi areas of East Africa, Iris Berger (1976) sustains that these cults offered large numbers of women initiates an unusual degree of authority in ritual situations and provided smaller numbers with long-term positions of high status. It is because these cults cannot be defined as peripheral that such a status elevation can be associ ated with them (Berger 1976). Anita Spring (1978) also insists on the social importance of the cooperative networks that Zambian Luvale women come to form through their participation in spirit possession rituals. This female-con trolled curative system enables women to translate their reproductive potential into alternative pursuits that are essential to preserving the wider community. Pamela Girschick Ben-Amos's study (1994) of olokun possession among the Edo in Nigeria more forcefully suggests that women's religious associations are not necessarily peripheral or low in status. Women play primary religious roles as priestesses in both the urban and rural Edo areas, and the status that urban women achieve in this possession cult is permanent. The psychological bene fits of participation are not temporary outlets but a real redefinition of self. In some cases, however, spirit possession has been considered to be a rein forcement of women's oppression rather than a challenge to it. As demon strated by Roger Gomm (1975), possession by the Digo women of Kenya reinforces the social control system that keeps them subservient to men. Edward Alpers even uses the term 'domestication to describe the function of male controlled possession in Zanzibar (1984, 700). Marie-Claude Dupré similarly explains the possession trance in Congo-Brazzaville. Possession by the water spirit mukisi enables Tsaayi women to rebel against all aspects of their social situation with the possibility of expressing their desire for the richness of the male world; to eat abundantly and even partake of meat, normally forbidden to them; and to be exempted from the task of carrying heavy water containers. This casting off of their subordinated position and of the exploitation of their</page><page sequence="3">368 C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 labour force is only temporary because, in the end, the spirit is exorcised and the woman pacified without the hoped-for economic gain, and she returns to her prescribed feminine role (Dupré 1974). Likewise, in the siku possession ritual Bembe women contribute to the maintenance of their subaltern posi tion. Although participation in the ritual enhances a woman's status, the social reason of the illness that caused the possession, namely their excessive physical labour, is never revealed but rather obscured (Dupré 1981-1982). In a critical note on her reading ofTsaayi possession, Dupré suggests that an interpretation of these rituals as a women's rebellion against their inferior sta tus and a pursuit of equality to men 'submits [her] reflection to male, Tsaayi and Western, domination, as if woman could only define herself in relation to man and against him' (1978, 81). In her account of Sudanese zar possession Janice Boddy explicitly wonders why 'so many Western scholars are commit ted to viewing possession as a consequence of women's deprivation rather than their privilege, or perhaps their inclination' (1989, 140).' She dismisses Lewis's idea that women possessed by zar spirits simply seek the same status held by men by positing the complementarity of men's and women's social worlds and highlighting women's distinctive agency. Both sexes are active participants in the social life of Sudan. If men are central and women peripheral with respect to Islam and external relations, women are central and men peripheral when it comes to physical, social, and cultural reproduction (Boddy 1989). Through possession women resituate the daily reality in light of their world and their own specific concerns without denying the dominant masculine ideology (Boddy 1989). Psychoanalyst and anthropologist Ellen Corin also proposes an actor-oriented evaluation of the zebola female possession ritual among the Mongo in the Democratic Republic of Congo. She states that spirit possession redefines the foundations of the relationship of Mongo women with the cul tural order (1998). The ritual does not challenge the legitimacy of male-dom inated social rules and values, but the zebola spirit 'de-captures the woman from their overwhelming authority and suspends the rigour of their applica tion' (Corin 1998, 95). This process of distancing is realized by creating a collective female space filled with rhythm and dancing and a heightened atten tion for bodily care, punctuated by daily reproductive activities that define the internal borders of the social order (Corin 1998). Concerning spirit possession among the rural Punu of Congo-Brazzaville, I have adopted an attitude that is sensitive to an androcentric bias, such as that mentioned by the above authors, and will attempt to analyse the phenomenon from the actor's perspective. As put forward by Boddy and Corin, the ideas of distinct yet complementary male and female social worlds and of the female domain as one of regeneration will prove to be essential to understanding</page><page sequence="4">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 369 Punu spirit possession, albeit in a different way. Whereas in the zar and zebola cults possession chiefly has a healing function for afflicted women, among the Punu possession by bayisi spirits is above all a medium of revelation for the spirits that conditions the community's well-being. Hence a difference can be observed in the way female regenerative power operates in these cults. It seems that in the zar and zebola cults a female collective space is secured that acti vates women's regenerative capacities in order to distance them from the male dominated world, and enables the afflicted women to rearticulate their social position. Among the Punu the bayisi cult is itself a celebration of female regen erative capacities in their potential to assure social and cosmic revitalisation, hence sustaining women's social position in relation to men in their ideologi cal basis of gender complementarity. Some cautions should be made, however, concerning the frequent use of the term 'agency' in actor-oriented perspectives. In her study of the Islamist revival movement among Egyptian women, Saba Mahmood discusses the problems that follow from assumptions that undergird agency' as it is invoked by feminist scholars. Agency is generally understood by these scholars as 'the capacity to realize one's own interests against the weight of custom, tradition, transcendental will, or other obstacles', and hence assumes 'the humanist desire for autonomy and self-expression' that realizes itself'in the form of an act of resistance' (Mahmood 2005, 8). Likewise, Sherry Ortner suggests that there is 'something about the very word "agency" that calls to mind the auton omous, individualistic, Western actor'. According to her, social agents are always involved in, and can never act outside of, the multiplicity of social rela tions in which they are enmeshed' (Ortner 2006, 130). It is also out of the view that 'the ability to effect change in the world and in oneself is historically and culturally specific' that Mahmood suggests that 'the meaning and sense of agency cannot be fixed in advance, but must emerge through an analysis of the particular concepts that enable specific modes of being' (2005, 14). In this she suggests a way of thinking about human agency in its relation to embodied capacities and means of subject formation. The understanding of agency as the capacity to realize one's own interests and as a form of resistance or subversion is also apparent in possession studies like Boddy's. More generally, in line with the current emphasis on the negoti ability of social reality, the idea that possession is a way for women to develop their own perspective on social reality, to deal with conflicting roles or norms and/or to dislocate or subvert gender categories is prevalent in several studies (Behrend and Luig 1999; Fiéloux 1999; Rausch 2000). Similar to Mahmood, Mary Keller (2002) presents a critical examination of the underlying assump tions of liberal feminists' evaluations and stresses the Western bias that underlies</page><page sequence="5">370 C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 the emphasis put on conscious active agency and autonomy as the basis for gaining power and developing ones subjectivity. According to her, this bias makes it impossible to appreciate the experience of your personality being determined by an external entity as a real, empowering event. She remarks that authors of possession studies generally appear unable to accept that possessed women are overcome by a power from a spiritual entity, as the witnesses to possession say is the case. In order to narrow this kind of gap between the truth of spirit possession and the effort of many anthropologists to place that powerful reality elsewhere, Tony Perman (2011) advocates an agent-oriented approach in terms of understandings of the self. Possession among the Ndau of Zimbabwe is analysed by Perman as a process through which the medium learns to focus on the relationship with the spirit as an intersubjective habit. However, the question could be asked whether it would not be better to privilege other explanatory terms than agency in regard to spirit possession. Although attributing agency to both spirits and medium, Perman clearly states that 'once the medium gives way to the spirit, he or she is no longer the agent of the experience' (2011, 86). It remains somehow paradoxical, as noted by Corin (1998), to ascribe the control by an external agent as a form of agency. Steven Friedson neatly recapitulates the problem: 'Given the current emphasis on agency—gaining it, losing it, granting it, taking it, sharing it, dispensing it—what do we do with people who claim none, in fact are insistent that they are not there at all, are totally away, possessed by a god or spirit?' (2009, 9). It is out of this kind of concern to take women's lived reality seriously and to be able to understand how the possessed female body can be effectively powerful that Keller proposes to dismiss the notion of agency and to revalue 'receptiv ity' and 'permeability' outside of dualistic notions such as active-passive or agent-victim (2002). Since these discussions on domination, agency, and self-realization in pos session are so clearly linked to the idea of power it seems the notion of power should be explored further. In this regard, Ivan Karp (1989) offers a very inter esting vision in his essay on African spirit possession. Customarily, in anthro pology and the social sciences, power is understood in terms of access to and control over people and resources. Possession is then interpreted as a means of exercising control under conditions of inequality. This definition was privi leged in the first studies on possession. Power can also be defined as 'capacity and agency' (1989, 105), as is proposed in recent studies on possession. Karp, however, also distinguishes a third sense of power as 'energy and potentiality' (1989, 105). This last definition is helpful in order to understand the empower ment that comes about through the experience of possession by spiritual beings. Susan Kenyon, for instance, signals this form of power in zar possession where,</page><page sequence="6">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 371 once a spirit comes down, a possessed woman 'is felt to be surrounded by an aura of spiritual energy' (1999, 101). According to Karp (1989), many African societies view the world as cyclical and entropie, and are fundamentally con cerned with physical and social reproduction. In ritual, the power potentially available in nature is tapped through the activities of certain individuals to assure the desired reproduction. Possession trance is one of these ritual activi ties that channels power as energy. This particular vision on power invites us to consider a complex analysis that takes into account multiple dimensions, namely how possession is embedded in relations of domination or resistance, how it enables the possessed to act on their own terms, and/or how they are invested with powerful energy. This makes it possible to evaluate agency in regard to these different dimensions while linking it to the question of self realization and subject formation, as suggested by Mahmood and Perman. For the Punu case I privilege the term of receptivity, as suggested by Keller when treating the dimension of power, as the channelling of energy, as stressed by the Punu themselves. The term agency' is used when analysing how this recep tive attitude, which resounds with maternal capacity, sustains Punu women's social position and sense of subjectivity. Finally, in analysing Punu possession in relation to male authority structures, the question of power as domination is addressed. When interviewing Punu women about the bayisi they were definitive about the necessity of respecting the spirit's wishes. Every question concerning the actions undertaken in relation to the spirits was answered with 'the bayisi want it like that'. Possession trance itself can only occur when a muyisi2 him/ herself desires to be amidst the humans and takes the initiative. However, a condition on the human side is that the possessed person must have an open mind and, further, that the attitude of the people is a manifestation of their desire to have the spirits present during the celebration. Therefore, as is dis cussed in this paper, the Punu clearly acknowledge receptivity as a condition for a spirit to take possession of a person. The agency of the possessed woman is somehow situated in her capacity to let a receptive attitude be activated through a collective desire for it. The main activity in these celebrations, cir cular dancing, most powerfully realizes this mood of desire as a condition for social and cosmic regeneration. Through its continuous waving motions, which actualise the aquatic universe of the bayisi in its cyclical regenerative power, the dancing invites the spirits to come by means of a possession trance as an energetic feeling of being overpowered. This recognition of the female regenerative capacity sustains women's social position alongside male author ity structures. In a final digression, the issue of possession trance and female power is explored with regard to the Congolese church of Zéphirin Lassy,</page><page sequence="7">372 C. Plancke /Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 which penetrated the Punu region in the 1980s and is rapidly increasing in importance, thus causing a significant depreciation and dismissal of the cele brations for the bayisi} The Punu of Congo-Brazzaville Culturally, the Punu people belong to the area of the Lower Congo, more specifically to its northern region (Jacobson-Widding 1979: 10). Oral tradi tion locates their origin in the southwest portion of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Koumba-Manfoumbi 1987). They were a dissident faction of the Yaka people who fought against the Kongo kingdom in the sixteenth century, were driven away, and progressively moved to the north (Perrois and Grand Dufay 2008). In 1906, with the division of the French Congo into three autonomous colonies, the Punu territory was split up by a border, the largest part of which became part of Gabon. The Punu of Congo-Brazzaville actually occupy two districts, the district of Nyanga and the district of Divenié, where they cohabitate with the Nzebi. Some differences can be observed between the Punu of Gabon and Congo. Influenced by neighbouring peoples who originated in the centre of Gabon and moved to its southern part (Perrois and Grand-Dufay 2008), the Gabonese Punu adopted some of their institutions such as the initiation society Bwiti. The Congolese Punu, on the other hand, stayed in closer contact with Lower Congo peoples, such as the Buissi, Lumbu, and Kunyi. As is characteristic of the peoples of this northwestern region (Soret 1959; Hagenbucher-Sacripanti 1973; Jacobson-Widding 1979; Merlet 1991; Hersak 2001), nature spirits are of primary importance to them, particularly the water spirits named bayisi ba tnambe, or bayisi for short. They are considered to be the primary agents of the society's well-being, ensuring the fertility of women and crops and the abun dance of game and fish. Fieldwork was conducted for a period of 20 months in the district of Nyanga.4 This entailed learning the language, intensive participation in the daily life of women and dance celebrations, and recording and accurately tran scribing numerous songs and interviews. In order to gain a deeper under standing of the bayisi and the practices linked to these beings, I frequently consulted healers devoted to the water spirits and mothers of twins, ranging in age from 20 to 65. As a consequence, this paper presents the conceptions and celebrations linked to the bayisi as they prevailed some decades ago and as they are still present today, although to a lesser degree.</page><page sequence="8">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 Map 1. Location of the research area in the district of Nyanga</page><page sequence="9">374 C. Plancke /Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 The Universe of the BayisP From the first days of my stay the Punu revealed to me the existence of spirits called bayisi. As among the Yombe and the Vili of Congo-Brazzaville (Hagen bucher-Sacripanti 1973; Hersak 2001), a distinction is made according to the habitat of these beings, one being the water spirits (bayisi ba mambe) and the other the land spirits (bayisi ba musiru/disimu). As the latter are of minor impor tance currently, the general term of bayisi is used to refer to the water spirits. These aquatic beings dwell in rivers or, more frequently, in pools, and manifest themselves in waves, whirlpools, and the rising and falling of the waters or tides. Every village has a main pool, belonging to the ruling matriclan (ibandu), in which a tutelary spirit dwells that guarantees the villages well being. The spirit and the pool are referred to by the same name; although this name designates a single being that can be male or female, it is presumed that a couple lives in each pool. The bayisi do not stay in the water permanently; it is said that they love to sit on the rocks bordering the pool and to walk in the surrounding areas. The spirits are said to have anthropomorphic traits. They are represented as human beings who are very beautiful, with white skin and long, straight hair. They have a proud manner of being that shows itself in the flexibility of their necks. Although they are humanlike, they are linked to natural phenomena like rain or thunder and a number of animals. The bayisi are most directly associated with fish. A recurring idea among the Punu is that catfish are spirits or the children of spirits, although the represen tation of bayisi as human beings with a fishtail is very recent. I heard it only in the discourse of youngsters, who also use the term 'siren' to refer to the bayisi.b Although they live in the water the spirits can manifest themselves as terres trial and celestial animals, primarily snakes, especially large ones. According to Punu, some spirits are accompanied by snakes or send them as a sign. The sight of the grey parrot also signals the nearness of the spirits. Notwithstand ing this widespread presence outside of the pool, the bayisi are primarily situ ated in the water. Their aquatic universe is also the world from which children come. The Punu say that children 'come in the water' and that the bayisi drive out the amniotic fluid during childbirth. Twins (mavase) and children born with an anomaly (bakite), such as a physical handicap or abundant hair, have a privileged link with the spirit world and, contrary to ordinary children, keep it all of their life. They are considered to be bayisi who have decided to live among humans. They come from the pools and arrive in pirogues, as the bayisi also do, very often in times of flood. Some mothers of twins told me that heavy rains and storms broke out when they gave birth to their twins. Conse quently, when twins die it is said that they go home to their aquatic universe.</page><page sequence="10">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion inAfrica41 (2011) 366-395 375 Although every muyisi has a proper name the water spirits do not present individual physiological or psychological traits. However, they do have certain generic characteristics. First, they are very generous. It is thanks to them that pregnancies are numerous, that harvests are good, and that hunting and fish ing are prosperous. Through dreams or possession trance the spirits, and espe cially twins, can also directly reveal where to find game, fish, money, or other desired material goods. What matters above all is that the beneficiary of these gifts should be grateful and not try to take advantage. A doubtful or sceptical attitude toward a revelation from the spirits is counterproductive; it is impos sible to refuse a spirit's gift without provoking their anger and inciting them to send bad luck and barrenness to the world. Indeed, the bayisi not only have the power to give life but also to provoke illness and death as sorcerers (baiasi) do. Some Punu said that contracts can be made between a spirit and a sorcerer entailing obscure exchanges of wealth for human flesh. There are also bad spirits that love to kill people. However, these cases are considered exceptional and the consequence of a spirit corrupted by a sorcerer. Normally bayisi chase away every sorcerer that tries to associate with them. In regard to the previ ously mentioned special link between twins and the spirit world, twins are presumed to be untouchable by sorcerers. Ultimately, if the bayisi do not always act to promote the well-being of their people it is a consequence of their whimsical character (maviri). They give to whom they want, when they want and if they feel like it. Their choices are incomprehensible to humans and depend on their own wishes. Some parents of twins complained that they had not received any special gift from their children, who instead favoured strangers. Mothers also portrayed in detail the impulsive and irascible nature of their twins, such as getting angry the moment one of their wishes is not satisfied. Even as a baby, a frustrated twin can refuse his/her mothers milk or make her breasts run dry. When really displeased, there is a danger that the twin will return to the spirit world and no longer care for humans. The demands of the bayisi also reveal a concern for cleanliness, both physically and morally, which includes an absence of conflict and selfish ness that should lead to a sense of sharing. Above all, the bayisi want to be adored and implored through singing and dancing. These desires for solidar ity, adoration, and obedience are most successfully met through collective dance celebrations dedicated to them and aiming to satisfy them so that they continue to assure the society's prosperity. Before we turn to these celebrations, it should be noted that besides the spirits that are linked to a pool and to the matriclan that owns the pool, there are water spirits, also named bayisi, that do not have a fixed habitat and are not linked to a clan territory.7 These are closely associated with the diseases they</page><page sequence="11">376 C. Plancke /Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 provoke and heal. These spirits normally reveal themselves in dreams, trances, or visions to a woman who then becomes a water spirit healer (ngange bayisi)? In a Punu idiom, it is said that she has 'picked up the bayisi'. Sometimes future healers pick up objects like a piece of wood or stones that are recognized as tangible proof of their election. The bayisi thus gathered are kept in a water bowl at the healers home. The revelation process presents recurring features: the revelation is unexpected; the person becomes ill; after an initial period of refusal of the spirits she accepts her election and begins to heal afflicted people; the spirits continue to send her advice about medicinal plants and treatments through dreams or trances. Sometimes they predict future events. The illnesses treated by these water spirit healers include fertility disorders, headaches, nervousness or madness, and also some typical child diseases due to children's difficulty in separating from the original bayisi universe. Celebrations for the Bayisi The celebrations dedicated to the bayisi (u kimbe bayisi) take place regularly on two occasions: before the collective fishing in the pools of the tutelary spirits, and at the birth or death of twins.9 They are occasionally organised to welcome a revelation of the spirits through trances, dreams, or visions. The whole vil lage participates in these celebrations. The main part is a circular song-dance performance that takes place near the pool around the shelter of the spirit in the case of preparation for a collective fishing party, or on occasions involving twins, at the home of the parents around the newborn twins or at the twin's home around the deceased body. The majority of the participants in the dance are women; these dances are even called 'women's dances' by the men, who rarely participate except for fathers of twins. They are conducted by a woman, a mother of twins or a water spirit healer, who introduces songs and enjoins the congregation to dance. Beforehand she prepares the participants by paint ing one red and two white spots on the middle of their forehead and temples or, in the case of a mother of twins, a white line from the middle of the fore head to the right temple and a red one to the left temple. She regularly pours palm wine on the dance circle. Mothers of twins and water spirit healers are also the only ones who own and play an instrument, named iwunge, used exclusively to celebrate the bayisi. It is fabricated from a piece of wood, sculpted on the two sides in the form of a bell with an internal clapper. The songs that are performed on these occasions are called water spirit songs {tumbu tji bayisi) or twin songs (tumbu tji mavase). The spirits themselves communicate these songs to humans through dreams or trances. Their refrains</page><page sequence="12">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 òli are mainly descriptive. A number of them bring to mind the aquatic universe of the bayisi and, above all, the animals related to them. For instance, one song describes how the huge tree snake, mamba, charms with her undulating move ments and loves to tease the squirrel. Some songs celebrate the power of the spirits to assure the well-being of the people. Since twins are associated with spirits, other songs glorify their parents and dictate the conduct needed to bring up these capricious beings. The songs have a call-and-response structure: a singer introduces the refrain that is repeated by all participants; she then improvises other phrases citing the names of spirits, twins, or parents of twins while the chorus continues to repeat the refrain. During a celebration, the songs follow one another without interruption or by inserting at the end an appropriate formula, such as 'Desire for the muyist (Nzale muyisye) or 'Joy joy' ( Tsay tsaye). There are times when this succession of songs is interrupted by a solo song, called munumbu, which conveys the longing for the spirit world and is directly addressed to the bayisi or twins by mothers of twins or spirit healers. It is immediately followed by another call-and-response song. This singing is accompanied by the sound of the bell specific to the occasion and by the drumming of a tambour (ndungu), also used for rejoicing dances (cf. Plancke 2010) and played by a man seated near the dance circle. These instruments sustain the flowing motion generated by the continuous singing of the participants. The bell produces an unending rattling sound while the simple rhythm from the drumming repeats without marked breaks. The danc ing amplifies this sense of continuing movement through its repetitive, circu lar structure. The dancers rhythmically mark the same steps while progressing in a circle, the one following the other. First, according to the length of the rythmo-melodical phrase, they mark one or three steps while slightly advanc ing, the upper body inclined and the arms bent. They then propel themselves and lift up the heels on a second, more-marked step, simultaneously straight ening the body and letting the arms drop. Through the repetition of these steps, in a seemingly never-ending whirling progression, a drive is generated that is communicated from one dancer to another, awakening a collective enthusiasm. Another dance form consists of alternately marking two steps with the right foot followed by two with the left, while moving in the circle. In the course of a song-dance event, vocal techniques are used to stimulate the dancing. The singer regularly returns to the refrain instead of adding impro vised phrases or repeats a part of it while the chorus completes the remainder. The continuous resounding of the refrain and/or the speeding up of the alter ation between the lead singer and the chorus strengthens the singing, enhances its collective dimension, and intensifies the dancing, thus helping to trigger trances among the participants.</page><page sequence="13">378 C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 This occurrence of possession trances {dulendu) is essential for a celebration to be considered successful. In October 2005, during the celebration preced ing the collective fishing of the pool Ireyi of the village of Moungoudi, the dancing was quite mediocre and no possession occurred. The person in charge of the event refused to pour palm wine, a gesture that facilitates contact with the ancestral worlds, since the absence of trances suggested a reticence on the part of the spirits. Ultimately, it is the spirits who take the initiative to possess a person. This can happen whenever they want to reveal their presence. A mother of twins told me how her co-spouse, who happened to be at the other side of the village at the moment of the delivery of her children, entered into a possession trance and communicated the news of the twin birth. During celebrations trances multiply under the influence of the intensity of the dancing. At the death of an aged twin, for instance, her granddaughter entered into a trance when her grandmother, who was already in a deep coma, moved her feet. She remained in trance during the vigil; only when the dancing became more powerful were other women also possessed by the deceased. According to the Punu, the primary condition for entering into a trance possession is an opening of the mind (ilundji dji tjibuge). The term ilundji, translated here as 'mind', designates the top of the head, near the fontanel, as well as the principle that resides there and leaves the body during dreams or trances. Possession trance is explained by the Punu as the leaving of the mind and the coming of the spirit. During trance the movements of the body are quite variable. Some people softly roll on the floor or repeat one single move ment. Others violently fling their body toward the co-participants. What is striking, above all, in these trances is the lack of control and the execution of movements that, while sometimes having a rhythm of their own, do not fol low the regular dance rhythm; those in trances often move out of the dance circle. There seems to be little codification and the spirit is not imitated by clearly identifiable movements. Sometimes possessed people speak, sometimes they don't. When they do, it is said that it is the spirit who speaks through them. Unlike trance movements, these revelations of the spirits are strongly codified and very similar for every muyisi or deceased twin. They can exhort a collective action that is needed for the well-being of the village, but mainly express the spirit's wishes or dissatisfaction because a desire has not been ful filled. A wish that is ever present in these revelations is one of being adored through singing and dancing. During celebrations the spirits communicate which songs they want to hear and whom they wish to be present, and com plain about the intensity or duration of the dancing. The person in charge of the celebration responds in order to satisfy them and continues to implore them to grant good luck.</page><page sequence="14">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion inAfrica4l (2011) 366-395 379 The possessed persons rarely remember their trance experiences. When I asked the granddaughter of the aged twin mentioned previously about her trance experience, she answered that during the night she had dreamed of her grandmother and that, except for the onset of the trance, she did not remem ber anything. However, the words she spoke were heard by the other partici pants and quite vividly illustrate the typical content of a trance revelation. The deceased had been kept in town for health reasons by her children against her will. During the granddaughters possession trance she complained that the people did not respect her wishes although she had given them good luck. This complaint referred to her wish, expressed when she was still alive, to be brought back to her village, and also to her present wish that the women perform a lengthy dance for her. She further complained because the person in charge of the celebration had organised a funeral vigil although she had demanded, through trance, to be buried immediately. Other reasons for her dissatisfac tion, often uttered by twins in general, were the heavy shelves of her coffin and the flowered sheet. Before letting the body enter the grave the person in charge of the burial tried to satisfy the deceased in order to bring good luck to the village. She asked the deceased to not be capricious as she had been during her life, but to say what had to be done for the good of the community. The per son in charge of the burial also recalled how the people had accompanied the deceased to her grave and implored the twin to not be angry because the cem etery had not been sufficiently cleaned. Lastly, the person in charge further described in detail all the food the women had prepared to share together and insisted that this would be a place of sharing, once more asking the deceased to give good luck to the village. Because trances serve as a medium for the spirits to express their dissatisfac tion, the experience is sometimes described by the Punu as one of 'being beaten by the spirit'. The uncontrolled and often violent nature of the trance movements are understood to be an expression of anger from a spirit who does not feel respected and, in this way, compels the people to hear his or her com plaints. Through possession trance a spirit can actually oblige a person to fulfil his wishes. For example, Itsuru, the tutelary spirit of the village of Lemba, does not want girls to wear false hair locks, which is now fashionable for young women, and makes the girls tear them out during trance. The same spirit once punished a woman for refusing to assist at a celebration even after rejecting invitations from women who were already possessed. The spirit took posses sion of her and made her crawl a distance of 3 kilometres on her knees until she reached the dance place. Twins act in a similar compulsory way, especially during their funeral. One report states that a twin made her funeral vigil last for two weeks by provoking numerous trances that transmitted her desire that those present continue dancing until she was finally buried.</page><page sequence="15">380 C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 Possession Trance as the Spirit's Revelation It is clear from the above description that the Punu conceive of possession trance, first and foremost, as a form of revelation. Like dreams, trances are a medium for the spirits to reveal themselves to humans. For healers it is the medium through which they acquire their curative capacities. Generally, heal ers remember the vision they had during a trance10 and describe it, similar to a dream, as a succession of images or voices that reveal healing methods, herbs, or specific cases that need their intervention. Although the unexpected first contact with the bayisi often provokes an illness, it is not the illness that grants them the legitimacy to be a healer but the revelation. The trance does not intervene in a healing. Healers mainly use some form of medicine. Hence the idea that in Africa possession almost always begins with affliction and aims at healing affliction (Kramer 1993) does not apply to the Punu case. This is even more striking in the case of a possession by a territorial water spirit. No illness is required to enter possession. The possessed person does not remember the trance, but people surrounding her hear the words revealed by the spirit. Because of a danger of getting ill or going mad, trances can be interrupted when they become too violent or continue for too long, but this is a possible consequence of the experience of trance, not an essential aspect of it. As men tioned previously, what is absolutely needed for a trance to occur is the open ing of the mind. Only when this condition is satisfied can the spirits come, take possession of the person, and speak through her. The Punu thus explicitly acknowledge the need of a receptive attitude on the part of the possessed for this revelatory trance experience to take place. Even though trance can be described and experienced in negative terms as a violent overtaking, on a col lective level it is highly valued by the Punu for the direct contact that it estab lishes between humans and spirits, since communication with the spirit world guarantees social well-being. More generally, in their discourse on the bayisi the Punu insist on the gen erosity of these beings and praise their abundant gifts and enchanting won ders. An intervention of the spirits in their life is in the first place considered a promise of plenitude. Hope prevails when they manifest themselves among humans. Fear or ambivalent feelings due to their whimsical and imposing character, their tendency to become angry and provoke bad luck, illness, or barrenness when not respected, are not directly expressed but more subsidiary after emphasizing their goodness. The celebrations for the bayisi rouse this positive attitude toward the spirits most powerfully. They are intended as a collective adoration of and rejoicing for the spirit world. The songs evoke, in vivid images, the spirit world in its sensory diversity and richness as a tangible, nearby reality that can reveal its splendour at every moment. The formulas</page><page sequence="16">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 381 that end songs, like 'Desire for the muyisi or 'Joy joy', powerfully express the longing for this world and the joy it brings. The collective e' that echoes as a response spreads these positive feelings among the whole congregation. The munumbu, the monodie song dedicated to the spirits, further conveys this longing, not only in its content' ' but also in its very structure, evolving in a free metrical mode and made up of a succession of long and evenly sung adages (bitonu) whose propelling force flows out in more expressive melismas. As this solo performance immediately precedes a call-and-response song, its deep affective charge infuses the subsequent singing and dancing that more intensely glorifies the spirit world so that the spirits will want to be present. Hence the attitude toward the spirits is clearly one of adorcism, of keeping the spirits with one. Only in the case of possession by non-localised spirits do adorcism and exorcism co-exist. The healer keeps the spirits as allies but must exorcise them when they cause illness. In an analysis of the different nkisi among the Kongo, impersonal spirits incarnated in an object, Marie-Claude Dupré observes that the world of the water spirits is one in which nature is considered to be good and in harmony; since the water spirits give humans a share in this natural richness their duality of benevolence/malevolence is accepted. But in order for humans to be able to act, their beneficial side is emphasized while the unfavourable side is mini mised (Dupré 1975). The universe of the bayisi among the Punu seems to be very close to that of the Kongo universe described by Dupré. Especially in possession trance, the rather unfavourable side of the water spirits can mani fest itself without being put to the fore. It is not the violent character of the possession or submission to the spirits will that is accentuated; rather, atten tion is given to the revelations of the spirits, even when they are complaints or angry outbursts, since respecting the spirit's wishes is the best way to restore good relations with them. The custom of painting participants at spirit cele brations with white and red chalk supports this interpretation. If we follow Jacobson-Widding's interpretation (1979) of the use of the colours white, red, and black by the peoples of the Lower Congo, the combination of the colours white and red points to the effort to give a positive orientation to an ambiva lent force. The Cosmic Elaboration of Maternal Regenerative Capacity The universe of the bayisi, quite obviously, has a maternal dimension. Accord ing to the Punu, babies come from this world and are still in contact with it since their mind, situated at the top of the head near the fontanel, is still open. They also have a particular way of smiling, called u seve, that is not addressed</page><page sequence="17">382 C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 at anyone but shows their happiness to stay in their water spirit world. The pools where the spirits live are not unlike the uterus. It is in the stagnant and lukewarm waters of these pools, rich with the pungent aroma of decomposed vegetative material, that life is maintained during the dry season. Feminine fecundity is likewise associated with warmth and the cycle that goes from putrefaction to regeneration. The Punu say that a woman is hot when she is fecund, and pregnancy is figuratively referred to as a cooking process. Follow ing childbirth, it is advised that a woman wash her vagina with hot water to prevent rot. Since the bayisi guarantee the abundance of fish and game, they have a further nourishing function just like mothers. Hence the elaboration of the world of the bayisi seems to be a transposition to a cosmic level of the apprehension of maternal regenerative capacity and of the intrauterine and early childhood experience of nurturing abundance and well-being that is based on this capacity. This conception of a cosmic maternal is collectively affirmed during the celebrations for the bayisi. In the Punu view, possession trance by the spirits is also comparable to pregnancy since both experiences present in similar ways. For the Punu, it is assumed that a woman will give birth to children; it is not a matter of personal choice. When Punu women speak about their pregnancies, they generally express pride at being a mother and continuing the matrilineage, but they also speak of the suffering that giving birth to children and their upbringing entails. In the case of twins these attitudes are even more striking. A pregnancy with twins is something that happens to a woman whether she likes it or not. It is a gift of the bayisi that she can only accept in gratitude and wonder. Mothers of twins are very proud about their election by the spirits, as if they share in the pride that characterizes the spirits themselves, but they also stress the suf fering that comes from birth and bringing up two children at once. Not only are there specific interdictions that must be respected, such as keeping their faeces in order to throw them in a river afterward, but also the whimsical char acter of twins makes it extremely difficult to satisfy them. For example, moth ers often complain about sleepless nights because they cannot turn their back on one of their children sleeping at their side for fear of upsetting them. The experience of possession trance as described by the Punu presents features similar to pregnancy. The spirits take possession of women on their own ini tiative. Possession is highly valued by the Punu since it is one of the most direct ways to contact the water spirit world of original well-being, but suffer ing is a necessary part of it. During celebrations the dancing stimulates the intervention or multiplication of possession trances since it is an actualisation of the cosmic maternal regen erative power embodied by the spirit world. Its continuous rhythmic motion,</page><page sequence="18">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 383 progressing in a never-ending circle, evokes the cyclical nature of the spirit world12 that, as the primary source of life without beginning or end, sustains and eter nally renews nature. In a way, participants are taken by the dance that seems to flow endlessly out of itself, just as the cycle of death and regeneration cease lessly propels itself. Here dance, 'like the vital flow', is 'rhythmic autogenesis in perpetual emergence' (Devisch 1993, 261). In this flowing waves of inten sity are roused, brought forth, or enhanced by the singing that is condensed in the propelling motion of the monodie song or in the collective repeating of the refrain of the call-and-response songs. These dance waves reverberate with the undulating movements of the snakes that are in touch with the bayisi, or with the fluctuations of the waves when, as the collective Punu imagery con veys, the spirit arrives in his or her pirogue. At their peak, a spiraling energy is generated that leads to a breakthrough to another level of consciousness within the trance; similarly, in the descriptions of visions the spirits suddenly emerge in a clearing out of a mass of heaving water or the thickening of fog clouds. Hence, as happens often during trance dancing, the whirling movements of the dance induce a loss of control that inaugurates the trance (Bourguignon 1968: 15). A loss of control or, to use a term that is less negative in its associa tion to passivity, a receptive attitude is sought through the dancing that, by involving the participants in a continuous and collective gyration, induces a decrease in individually oriented and rationally induced movement and action. The trance is the moment of actually receiving the spirit into oneself. Its onset is generally described by the Punu as a kind of shivering (u djilemune) and as a feeling of a current (dunzanze) that flashes through the body until the person is completely overpowered. Possession opens one to energetic, vital resources beyond the individual level. In trance the possessed woman is in immediate contact with the source of life embodied by the bayisi. The collective dancing cultivates the desire for this embracing disposition. Since the monodie song and the formulas that end the call-and-response songs explicitly voice the yearning for the spirit world, the receptive attitude that is favoured by the car rying dance motion takes on a mood of desire. This collective feeling of long ing is essential for possession trance to take place. Indeed, although it is said that spirits take possession of women of their own will, when no woman has an open mind or when desire is lacking in the celebrating community no pos session will occur. As such the dance celebrations, by stimulating possession trances through their structure and development, aim at realizing the maternal regenerative capacity in its cosmic dimension since this depends on a receptive attitude that is activated by a mood of desire. Hence trance dancing among the Punu can clearly be interpreted as a manifestation of woman's maternal receptive power.</page><page sequence="19">384 C Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 The Power of Receptivity Since in the Punu view possession trance is a favourite medium for the spirits to communicate their wishes to humans, the possessed woman preserves the maintenance of a productive relation with them through her receptive capac ity. This function of joining the human and spirit world, thus enabling the realization of the regenerative potential of the spirit world in humans and nature, affords women an important social position. Healers and mothers of twins are especially highly respected in Punu society. Until the 1980s mothers of twins wore distinctive signs, two red feathers of the grey parrot fixed at each side of their face, two straps crossed over the breast, and a bell tied at the waist. However, unlike the special position they occupy among the Gabonese Punu where a place is reserved for them in the association of male initiates (Dupuis 2007), in Congo they do not have such privileges. The collective celebrations for the bayisi, although they are conducted by a mother of twins or spirit healer, concern all women and value the general importance of women's regen erative capacities to assure cosmic renewal and the well-being of the commu nity. Since the pools of the tutelary spirits are linked to a territory, a village, and its ruling matriclan, the celebrations also foster a sense of belonging to a community and, by glorifying the spirit world in its maternal dimension, base this feeling on the experience of being nurtured and cared for. As such, they sustain the Punu social structure whose matrilineal principle of descent posits women as the ones who guarantee social cohesion and continuity. The authority over matrilineal groups, clan sections, and lineages, however, is exercised by men. The arrangements for the collective fishing in the pools of the tutelary spirits, one of the occasions for a celebration, clearly reflect this authority structure. The fishing takes place at the end of the dry season after the chief of the clan section that owns the pool has received a premonitory dream. It is the chief who gives the order to clean the path that leads to the pool and a dance space around it as well as the shelter of the spirit before the celebra tion can take place. After a direct invocation of the spirit and the demand to be generous, he also gives the authorisation to enter the pool. The fishing occurs according to strict rules. For some pools women are excluded; in others men fish in the centre while women occupy the borders. After the fishing party is completed the catches have to be shared according to regulations that assure equilibrium between the members of the ruling matriclan and those linked to it on the paternal side. Until recently women were prohibited from eating the head of catfish, often considered the best part, and other animals that are directly in touch with the spirit world like the python. In precolonial and colonial times the clan chief also directly invoked the bayisi in case of</page><page sequence="20">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 385 famine, therefore needing the intervention of a spirit healer. Thus while men exercise authority over the social groups constituted through the maternal regenerative capacity, they also exercise authority over the territory and its resources whose fertility is guaranteed by the maternal receptive power. This observation reveals a male desire to control the life-giving capacities of women and to impose on them the actualisation of these capacities. Until recent decades Punu marriages were arranged13 according to the interests of the lineages and served, and still serve, the reproduction of children who fall under the authority of these lineages. Along with this obligation to reproduce, married women also have a heavy charge of productivity. Women work much harder than men in rural Punu society. They perform most agricultural tasks, prepare food, and take care of the children. From a young age, girls are encour aged to work hard and to endure suffering. The attitude of submission and endurance that accompanies the exercise of the reproductive and productive female capacity also underpins the experience of possession trance. Like mar riage, possession trance also serves the collective well-being rather than indi vidual autonomy. The examples given of the spirit Itsuru who, by possession trance, punishes girls who wear false hair locks or a woman who refuses to assist at a spirit celebration show that the punishment ultimately concerns those searching for individual distinction or autonomous choice. The spirits' recurring demand that people, especially parents of twins, share and abstain from provoking conflicts is further evidence of this pre-eminence of collectiv ity. Hence the celebrations for the bayisi uphold the Punu social structure that is based on an obliged and controlled utilisation of female regenerative capac ities that assures social continuity. However, to solely stress the male capacity to control the people, the com mon resources, and the limits that the spirit celebrations impose on female autonomy and individuality would presuppose a unidimensional and Western biased vision of power and subjectivity that contradicts the lived reality of the Punu as I experienced it. During my stay, I felt an inner strength among women. Although women clearly recognize male authority, they are very much aware of their own value as the ones who sustain social structure. The celebra tions for the bayisi recognize this female receptive capacity that conditions the awakening of vital resources. The acknowledgement of this function gives women a social status and a distinct agency alongside the men. In a study on matrilineal and matrilocal societies, Nicole-Claude Mathieu remarks that in these societies maternity is not an individual achievement that improves the position of the woman, but a necessary experience for all women that entails an identity she qualifies as 'personal-collective' (2007, 18). This identity is marked by the idea of a timeless permanence that holds a cosmic dimension.</page><page sequence="21">386 C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 In Punu society the woman who, as a girl, is already called mother, has a part in the cosmic reproductive power linked to the maternal and as such already has social value as a potential mother. This power is not denied by men, just as they do not deny the value and efficiency of the celebrations for the bayisi. Since these celebrations engage the women as a collective group and exalt their regenerative power in its social and cosmic workings, they cultivate such a female cosmic, collective identity as the basis for a sense of subjectivity. It should be further noted that although the men make the decision to organize the collective fishing parties, the celebrations that coincide do not require male intervention but are led by women. In the case of the birth or death of a twin, the rituals that accompany the dance celebrations are executed entirely by a female specialist. In this respect a difference can be noted com pared to similar African societies in which male intervention shows a fear for and a desire to limit the female power that affirms itself on these occasions. When twins are born among the Yamba of Cameroon, a male ritual specialist erects a fence around the parcel of the mothers house and closes all the entries. The destruction of the fence after the reclusion period of the mother is consid ered a second birth that enables the passage of the children from a confused state to one that is socially acceptable (Gufler 1996). In his presentation of the twin rituals of the Aluund of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Filip De Boeck explicitly interprets the intervention of a male ritual specialist at twin birth as an attempt to contain the threat that this event presents for the male dominated social order since it is 'the most powerful expression of feminine regenerative capacities' (1991, 415) and shows their 'involvement in cyclical life-giving processes which escape the more linear order of male ideology and social control' (418). Dupré also explains the guiding participation of men in the mukisi possession ritual as a need to neutralise the superiority that this cult could give to women (1974). In Punu society such direct male intervention is absent. Male authority asserts itself in the control of the female regenerative capacity that is celebrated in the spirit celebrations, but it does not limit or negate this power. As previously noted, among the Punu possession is a part of a spirit cult that is a regular feature of social life and functions chiefly as a communication between the spirits and humans. Therefore possession is essential to assure the daily prosperity of the community and thus differs from the possession that intervenes in cults like the zar, zebola, or mukisi that mainly aim at heal ing afflicted women. In this respect comparison against another possession ritual in a matrilineal society is fruitful. Among the Bijago of Guinea Bissau, women are possessed by the souls of young men who died before reaching the initiation stage. This possession concerns all women and guarantees social</page><page sequence="22">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 387 well-being because it is necessary for the souls of the young men to help them accomplish the initiation phase and to transform them into beneficial entities (Henry 1994; De Sousa 1999). It is interesting to note that this matrilineal society recognizes that women possess a vital force naturally superior to men through their capacity to give birth, and that this power explains that they also have a part in the regeneration of life sources (Henry 1994). It is exactly this regenerative female capacity in its receptive dimension as it extends to a cos mic realm that is operative in Punu possession trance. Possession Trance and the Prophetic Church of Lassy Since the 1980s the church founded in 1953 by the prophet Zéphirin Lassy in Pointe Noire (Soret 1959; Hagenbucher-Sacripanti 1973; Hersak 2001) has penetrated the Punu region. Protestant and Catholic churches had already spread throughout the region at that time, beginning with a Protestant church in the neighbouring centre of Loubetsi in 1940. However, unlike these churches the prophetic14 church of Lassy, commonly called 'Eglise des bougies', is of Congolese African origin, has a much deeper influence on traditional ritual practices, and also assimilates some components like possession trance. Like other prophetic movements that flourish in this region (Hagenbucher Sacripanti 1987), Zéphirin Lassy founded his church with the explicit mission of eradicating witchcraft. Indeed, in many of these African religious move ments (Mary 2009; Ter Haar 2009), in line with the duality between good and evil that is deeply rooted in Christian theology, traditional practices are con sidered witchcraft and are demonized as opposed to good Christian practises. Therefore when the followers of Lassy's church arrived in the Punu area, they severely attacked the practises linked to the bayisi, a practise that was very much alive in the region at that time. Mothers of twins told me that preachers of Lassy's church obliged them to throw away the pots in which they kept the placenta of their children for ritual purposes (Plancke 2009), calling it a 'sorcerous' practice. They also advised them to bring their newborn twins to the church to close their powers' and to pray to them instead of performing the requested water spirit songs. As a consequence, the celebrations for the bayisi have greatly decreased in present times. Many families prefer to bring their twins to church. Even the celebrations preceding the collective fishing of the pools of the tutelary spirits have frequently been omitted in the last decade and are gradually disappearing throughout the region. There is, however, no strong influence of the churches on the practises themselves. I did not observe any Christian elements present in the ritual</page><page sequence="23">388 C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 actions, and no Christian songs are mixed with the songs of the bayisi. One of the reasons for this lack of syncretism can be found in the observation that the songs performed in Lassy's church are sung in munukutuba, the national lan guage of Congo, and that the drums that accompany them as well as the sty listic features of the music stem from the Vili culture located in the area around Pointe Noire and cannot be integrated without modifications into the Punu music that has its own style and is performed in the local dialect. The Punu themselves consider the Christian songs as foreign, calling them 'songs of God' (tumbu tji Nzambi) in opposition to the songs of local ancestral tradition that are called 'songs of the village' (tumbu tji dimbu). Wyatt MacGaffey (1986) likewise states that the Kongo twin cult, also a water spirit cult, has hardly been touched by syncretism, and that it is in these feminine practises that the old music of the Kongo can be heard and that the ancestral beliefs can be approached at their best. Although it demarcates itself from ancestral practises, Lassy's church has adopted elements from the practises related to the bayisi that were also and still are present in Vili society (Hagenbucher-Sacripanti 1973). Possession trance is a necessary component of their celebrations; however, the possessing agents are no longer the bayisi but the Holy Spirit referred to by the term ilundji. The possession in the celebrations of Lassy's church is also taught in the typical Christian good-evil dualism, and is very different from the ambivalence that characterizes the bayisi cult. Congruent with the Christian tradition that makes a distinction between possession by the Holy Spirit and by Satan (Ter Haar 2009), there are also possessions by devils, referred to by the French term 'diables', that are subject to an exorcist treatment. Hence possession trances are part of individual healing processes marked by the battle between devils and the Holy Spirit, and become more and more spectacular in their manifestation, a feature also noted by Nicolas Monteillet (2001) in contem porary Cameroon. The preachers in charge of the healing process in this man ner resume the traditional function of healer and base their powers on those of the water spirit healers. The actual preacher of one of the churches in the Punu region, for instance, is the nephew of a spirit healer who had received direct revelations from the bayisi. He explicitly told me that he inherited his powers from his maternal aunt. The preachers in these African Christian churches are always men, while the majority of participants are women. The persons who enter into possession trance are also almost exclusively women, as in the celebrations for the bayisi. But unlike the celebrations for the bayisi, a male specialist is in charge of the celebration and intervenes in the possession trance by putting an end to it when it is judged necessary. What more severely reduces the potential of these</page><page sequence="24">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 389 celebrations to collectively affirm female regenerative power, as is done in the celebrations for the bayisi, is their tendency toward a more individual orienta tion and as an exorcist healing cult for women afflicted by evil spirits.15 Monteillet likewise signals how 'in the Christian exorcism the possessed is an incarnated devil, a stigmatised being and not the intercessor of a spirit useful for the community' (2001, 152). Another striking feature that shows this dif ference is the absence in the church celebrations of dances as a collective bod ily actualisation of cyclic life-giving power. Conclusion Among the rural Punu of Congo-Brazzaville, possession trance is an essential part of the cult dedicated to the bayisi, water spirits that assure the prosperity of the clan and village community linked to them. It is a privileged medium for these generous but capricious beings to reveal their wishes to humans and to demand respect and adoration in order for them to be willing to assure their well-being by multiplying pregnancies and providing game, fish, or other material goods. Punu possession trance has to be understood in this relational context of bringing together humans and spirits. Although the Punu say the spirits take the initiative to come amidst the humans, a certain receptivity is needed on the human side that is expressed through having an open mind. This embracing attitude is activated through the singing and dancing which grounds it in a collective desire for the water spirit world, conceived in analogy with the intra-uterine space as an original maternal life-giving universe. In its circular, continuously propelling motion the dancing takes the participants in a flowing undulation that directly resounds with the waves of the spirits' water world and recalls the cyclic nature of their regenerative power. In moments of energetic intensification, and through the songs that explicitly convey the long ing for this world, the trance experience of blending into it is called forth. The main occasions for celebrating the bayisi are collective fishing parties in the pools of the tutelary spirits of the village and the birth or death of twins, as they are equated with spirits. Through the glorification of the world of the bayisi these celebrations exalt the female regenerative capacity as the basis for cosmic renewal and hence for the community's prosperity. The song-dance performances are also executed by women and led by mothers of twins or heal ers dedicated to the bayisi. In the case of a celebration preceding the fishing of the pools, it is the chief of the matriclan that owns the pool of the spirit that decides to organize the event and it is also he who supervises the sharing of the catch. This gender complementarity underpins Punu social structure where</page><page sequence="25">390 C. Plancke I Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 female regenerative capacity is recognized through the matrilineal descent principle as the basis for social continuity but where the need for male control is clearly posited. The attitudes of endurance and submission that are charac teristic of the trance experience also correspond to the general attitudes Punu women are expected to develop in exercising their reproductive and produc tive tasks. While this observation can lead to the interpretation that the spirit cult reinforces men's authority, the importance of women's role in the bayisi cult should be stated and the way it sustains women's social position. Men do not intervene as leaders in the celebrations and through transposition on a cosmic level, maternal life-giving powers are given high consideration and recognized as essential for the society's well-being. Furthermore, the receptive attitude that activates these powers should be put to the fore as it grounds the trance experience as a physical opening to the spirit world that channels the energy of this world of origins. By exploring a specific case, this article reconsiders the issue of possession trance and female power. Following Janice Boddy (1989), it is sensitive to a male bias in the interpretation that reduces these cults to a reaction of women against subordination. It therefore attempts to evaluate this phenomenon in its own right by putting the actor's point of view to the fore. The complemen tarity of the male and female social worlds is especially emphasized, since Punu possession is a part of the celebrations that glorify women's regenerative powers that underpin their distinctive social role. As these powers entail an opening up toward the coming of the spirit that unleashes live-giving poten tial, the term 'receptivity', proposed by Keller (2002), has been adopted. The power of this receptive attitude has been explained, in line with Karp's (1989) multidimensional vision of power, in terms of the channelling of cosmic energy. The notion of agency, so frequently used in studies on female posses sion, is employed in a limited way since it reveals a Western-biased vision that roots power and subjectivity in autonomy and resistance (Mahmood, 2005), a notion that does not seem to correspond to the reality of Punu possession. As suggested by Perman (2011), agency is instead stressed as the way that pos session by the bayisi, in its cultivation of female regenerative capacity, forges female subjectivity as grounded in a collective gendered identity. The celebrations for the bayisi have lost much of their importance and vital ity, due mainly to the penetration of the Congolese church of Zéphirin Lassy from the 1980s onward. Originating as an antiwitchcraft movement, this pro phetic church heavily attacked the celebrations linked to the bayisi for their allegedly sorcerous nature. Although the church did adopt practises of local tradition such as possession trances, these possessions have been integrated with the Christian vision of the battle between good and evil, either by the</page><page sequence="26">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion inAfrica4l (2011) 366-395 391 Holy Spirit or by evil spirits. This dualistic structuring marks a radical change with the ambivalence so characteristic of the bayisi spirits and of the trance experience itself as an involuntary overtaking that conditions prosperity through revelation and recognition of the spirits wish. Because of this inher ent ambivalence of the bayisi, the experience of possession is part of an affec tively intensive process of mutual attraction between humans and spirits that seeks to surpass the negative aspects attached to a relation with the spirits, and to orient the ambivalence of the spirits and of the human attitude toward its positive pole. Christian possessions, on the other hand, are more direct vehi cles for the manifestation of two logically opposed principles incarnated in two radically different beings in which desire has no constitutive role. Moreo ver, whereas the bayisi celebrations and their trances are a collective celebration of female regenerative power as the basis of Punu social continuity and pros perity, possession in the churches serves an individually oriented healing proc ess. The absence of collective circular dances embodying this female power is most significant in this respect.

Instead of asking why women in Mayotte resort to spirit possession, Michael Lam bek (1981) reverses the question and asks why men have no access to that part of the cul ture. According to him, the reason is found in the threat to a mans self-image through the loss of physical and moral control within possession. 2. As is the rule in Bantu languages, the singular/plural mark precedes the radical. Here muyisi is the singular form of bayisi. 3s This account of possession trance in the church of Zéphirin Lassy is very limited since my research does not focus on this question. It was also difficult to keep up with the church celebrations that are conducted in munukutuba, one of Congo's national languages that I do not speak nor understand. Hence I only indicate some major changes between these celebrations and those dedicated to the bayisi. 4. From May to October 2005 and from June 2006 until September 2007. 5. For a more detailed account of the universe of the bayisi, see Plancke (2009). 6. The term 'Marni Wata', frequently used today on the African continent to refer to water spirits, is rarely heard among the Punu. Even though the Punu associate the bayisi with white people, the Marni Wata imagery of a beautiful, seductive, but also deceitful and dangerous European woman (Drewal 2008) is rarely found, mainly among male youngsters that frequently leave their village. Also, there are no visual representations of Marni Wata figures as in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Jewsiewicki 2008). Dunja Hersak likewise observes that although the term Marni Wata is frequently used among the Yombe and the Vili of Congo-Brazzaville, it does not evoke the figurative image of a white, sensual woman but is above all the translation of forces of nature of the highest order which are the source of well-being, prosperity, increase and social harmony' (2008, 343).</page><page sequence="30">C. Plancke / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 366-395 7. In his study on the Vili and Yombe culture of Congo-Brazzaville, Frank Hagen bucher-Sacripanti makes a similar distinction between bakisi si, spirits that are localised in a sanctuary, linked to a territory, and personalised, and bakisi, spirits that act independently from geographical limits, are also invoked far from their original region, and sometimes afflict humans with terrible diseases. He affirms, however, that it is hard to make a neat distinction between the two categories (1973). According to Dunja Hersak, who has con ducted research in the same area, the term bakisi is used for both types of spirits. She sug gests considering them as entities that are situated on the same continuum as nature spirits (2001). This also seems to be the case for the Punu, where the term bayisi is used for the two types of water spirits. 8. The persons who receive these kinds of revelations generally belong to a lineage that already had healers among its members; transmission by inheritance and also by revelation completes one another. Some healers acquire their healing capacities only through inherit ance. They then continue a family tradition initiated by a close ancestor that has received direct revelations from the spirits. 9. For a more detailed account of the rituals, songs, and dances of twins among the Punu see Plancke (2009). 10. Since these trances do not take place in a public context and since the numbers of bayisi healers has decreased, I did not have the opportunity to witness these trances and hence cannot give a more detailed description. 11. Many of the adages of the monodie song dedicated to the bayisi are also sung in the lamentation song at funerals. They generally emphasize the loneliness of the singer and the separation with the beloved person, or express the desire to be once more near him or her. 12. Certain adages of the monodie song dedicated to the bayisi forcefully express the cyclical nature of the spirit world by suggesting that life and death are not opposed in this world. The adage A very old kapok tree, a kapok tree where a healer was buried, when the healer has putrefied, the tree grows' illustrates how life grows out of dead material. Another adage, 'There is death, she does not choose, I have died outside, where the weaver birds come to draw water', suggests that even in life-giving aquatic environments death can be present. 13. In former times during a woman's pregnancy a man could reserve the child. If it was a girl she would be his future wife; if it was a boy he became his homonym. 14. I have labelled this church 'prophetic' according to André Mary's definition (2009). 15. Roger Bastide (1972) uses the term 'shrinking' to describe the similar evolution of possession cults in Senegal, following the Islamic evasion, from cults linked to the good working of the universe, the productivity of harvests and women, to cults that are essen tially therapeutic.</page></plain_text>
