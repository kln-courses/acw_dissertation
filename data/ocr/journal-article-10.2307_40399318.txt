The Library of Living Philosophers, Vol- ume I, edited by Paul Arthur Schlipp. Northwestern University Press, Evanston and Chicago, 1939. $5.00. Pp. xvi, 708. Any symposium always presents special difficulties to the reviewer. But when the symposium is on Dewey's "metaphysical," logical, moral, religious, esthetic, social and educational philosophy, and he replies to its seven- teen contributors, confusion is rampant and clarity a genuine task. Espe- cially is this true when each contributor, quite naturally, seeks out and emphasizes what interests him, and interprets it in terms of his own thought. To Reichenbach, for example, Dewey's empiricism is central, but to Piatt, Dewey would be better understood if his naturalism were given more attention than his empiricism; Savery stresses Dewey's realism, while Santayana denies the naturalism altogether and Russell, the realism.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 1 2 1 Furthermore, much overlapping and tedious repetition is inevitable in such an effort as this volume represents. The volume also contains a biography of Dewey which might have been of more value if written by someone more objective than Professor Dewey's three daughters. It is not only unnecessarily sentimental, but neglects pertinent material necessary to the understanding of the develop- ment of Dewey's social philosophy. Catell and Beard are mentioned, for example, but no analysis is made of Dewey's support of America's entry into the World War, while these friends of his were dismissed from Colum- bia University for their opposition. And while two pages are devoted to Dewey's defense of Trotsky and his opposition to the Soviet Union today, no mention is made of Dewey's somewhat friendly attitude during the Russian Revolution and during the first decade of the young Socialist Republic. That such material would not be irrelevant is indicated by the attention given the latter question not only in the biography but in several of the papers. When Professor Geiger states that "No liberal movement of significance and weight has failed to enlist his ungrudging support, and no cause, however unorthodox, which proffers specific con- tributions and criticisms has gone unrecognized by him" (p. 345) , it is relevant to ask about his World War rôle, his attitude towards the American Federation of Teachers, and his opposition to the Committee for Democ- racy and Intellectual Freedom headed by Professor oBas. Besides the fact that the volume under consideration contains several papers which serve no possible use in clarifying Dewey's thought save per- haps as foils (I refer especially to Professor Stuart's paper on Ethics, Schaub's on Religion, and Pepper's on Aesthetics) , it would have been a far more valuable book if it had contained an expression of the Marxist position on the problems which Dewey handles. This is made clear throughout the volume, inasmuch as Dewey's own statement, the boagraphy, and at least five of the papers refer directly to Marxism and Dewey's relation to it.* There have been many unjustified and unsupportable criticisms of ♦EDITORIAL NOTE - Professor Schilpp, editor of the volume, apparently recognized this need, since he asked Professor V. J. McGill for a somewhat reduced version of his paper on "Pragmatism Reconsidered: An Aspect of John Dewey's Philosophy" which appeared in the Summer, 1939 issue of science and society. McGill complied, submitting a paper which Schilpp enthusiastically and unconditionally accepted (in a letter of June 6, 1939) . Three weeks later Schilpp informed McGill that his essay could not be included in the volume because Dewey, who was willing enough to reply to other criticisms, refused to reply to McGill's criticism "seriously" and at sufficient length (June 28). But in a letter to McGill (July 1) Dewey denied that he was unwilling to answer and stated that he himself was "the judge of the nature and the length of my remarks." This obviously</page><page sequence="3">1 2 2 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Dewey's philosophy and here, as always, he takes sufficiently good care of them, but as Professor Arthur E. Murphy suspects in his essay, Dewey has an almost uncanny faculty of so presenting (or creating) alternatives as to commit his critic to a doctrine altogether dreadful if he rejects Dewey's analysis. Since so much of Dewey's polemic involves this forensic maneuver, it might be relevant here to list a few such Deweyan alternatives referred to in the present volume: Either the instrumental doctrine of "warrented assertibility" (with all that this involves in Dewey's logic of inquiry) , or truth as correspondence between a realm of mind on one side and of matter on the other. Either knowledge is a passive reflection of an independently existing world (the spectator theory) , or it constructs its world by its own processes. Murphy writes (p. 207) , that Dewey's denial of "the obvious import of some reliably tested knowledge claims" is not comprehensible without such reference and that this is why "after burying the spectator theory of knowl- edge in one volume after another, he has been obliged to dig it up again in subsequent works to justify by contrast his own insistence that the true object of knowledge is not only got at by experimental methods but simply is the observable outcome of such experimental procedures." Either philosophy is concerned with "ultimate reality" over and beyond the sphere of ordinary experience and the separate sciences, or we must accept Dewey's epistemological doctrine that non-cognitive experience gives us the real. (Cf. Dewey, p. 525.) Either the scientific object (atom, solar system, H2O) is the real thing and the things we experience are unreal, or reality is given us in immediate experience and the objects of physical science are not "individual existential objects." (Murphy, p. 222.) Either social change occurs by objective legal or institutional recon- made Schilpp's position entirely untenable and McGill called his attention to this fact. McGill was forced to assume that he was being excluded from a volume devoted to a philosopher who, perhaps more than any other, has advocated the importance of arbitrat- ing all differences by free discussion. Schilpp excused himself and apologized, but did not even attempt to answer McGill's charge that he had rejected an article after uncon- ditionally accepting it, without giving any arguable reason. Dewey's attitude in the matter is difficult to understand. He was willing enough to reply to McGill's essay, but he wrote to Schilpp and to McGill (July 19) to the effect that the piece was propagandist, not philosophical. He complained that the trouble with McGill's article was that, instead of sticking to Marxism, he had gone out of his way to defend the Soviet Union. Does Dewey believe that his own undocumented charges against the Soviet Union are philosophical, while McGill's defense of the socialist order is principally propaganda? In the opinion of the editors of science and society the question raised here would have offered an admirable opportunity for free discussion.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 123 struction, that is, " 'changes in mechanical or outward arrangements/ " or by education, which, it must be noted, is "not an indoctrination of specific ways of change," and that the second is fundamental and the first " 'transi- tory and futile/ " (Kilpatrick, p. 468; cf. p. 42.) Either intelligent action for social change or non-intelligent action "such as relies on arbitrament by violence, or 'dialectical materialistic inevita- bility/ " (Dewey, p. 592.) (Dewey's frequent references to the Marxist theory and practice are so vague and so little relevant to anything Marx and Engels wrote as to create the suspicion that he has never read any of the Marxist classics.) Either one breaks up and makes atomically specific every problem to be solved and approaches it piece-meal, or one commits the idealist fallacy of taking in everything at once or of seeking a transcendent principle to apply mechanically to all particulars. To take just one instance, Dewey writes in answer to Professor Geiger (p. 592) that application of the (Deweyan) method of intelligent action begins at home and it is not our problem "as to what people on the other side of the world are going to do," and after stating that our difficulties in using his method will be less if we do not let "our imagination roam abroad to dwell upon the difficulties other nations and persons experience in using the method," he concludes with the startling pronouncement: "To consider the state of the world at large in this or any similar connection is itself a procedure that violates the supremacy of method." (Parenthetically, how this agrees with his partici- pation in the Trotsky campaign against the Soviet Union is difficult to see.) In short, either a long range plan and a world perspective, or intelligent social action. These are only a few of the undesirable alternatives Dewey, in his love for the disjunctive, has presented, and which are referred to in the volume under review. Professor Murphy is largely right in attributing Dewey's main emphases to particular schools of thought Dewey grew up with, and revolted against. What Murphy does not see but which is suggested by Dewey's whole philosophical development is that while opposing idealism and crude and inadequate realisms, Dewey has always had an eye out for what he considered the main enemy, materialism. Dewey's answer to Savery's direct challenge as to why he has not called his philosophy ma- terialism rather than naturalism seems to the present reviewer just a trifle disingenuous (p. 604 f.) . It is worth considering at the same time, how much of Dewey's emphases, since his "disillusionment" (after a short flirta- tion) with Soviet Russia, have been motivated rather explicitly by his "felt" need for justifying capitalist democracy's muddling through, and his passion for challenging Marxist thought. His daughters tell us, for example, that</page><page sequence="5">1 24 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY after the recent Moscow treason trials he concluded that "events in Russia were interpretable as the effects of any dogmatic social theory, in contrast to democratic liberalism" (p. 43) . Although the volume is devoted to a person designated as "one of the greatest living Americans/' adoration and flattery are not overdone. Pro- fessor Whitehead's two page contribution is out of place and Bertrand Russell's glib clowning is appropriately disposed of by Dewey. Of the other fifteen studies it is possible that ten contain suggestive statements and criticisms of Dewey's position. Joseph Ratner has difficulty with what he calls Dewey's confusion of "problems in general" with "general problems," leading him to what is "tantamount to a denial of the need for any general theory of society, of the state, of the individual, etc." (p. 63) . Randall seems to find a discrepancy between Dewey's "fine generalities about the 'method of cooperative intelligence' " and his failure to develop "a social engineering, in an applied science of political education" (p. 91) . Piatt finds Dewey's terminology more subjectivistic than it needs to be, and points out that Essays in Experimental Logic "was written partly as a reaction against and partly as a development of idealism" (p. 107) . Reichenbach makes some interesting contributions but it can be asked if Dewey is not right as opposed to him for the reason that Reichenbach's theory of experience is inadequate for his theory of science. Nevertheless one can sympathize with his fear that Dewey's "non-realistic interpretation of scientific concepts" is untenable (p. 164) . Arthur E. Murphy has written in the opinion of this reviewer the most trenchant and suggestive study in the volume. True, there are loopholes and Dewey can and does answer many of the questions raised but not the most important ones. Murphy fails to find in this philosophy "any single clear or unequivocal meaning" (p. 196) ; he believes that Dewey's analysis of logic as inquiry takes us not to specific sorts of inquiry but to an epistemological theory (cf. p. 201), and he suggests that Dewey "was still too much of an idealist to refer direct- ly from thought to its object" in his Studies in Logical Theory (p. 21 if.) , and that therefore the reference was to "immediate experience," i.e., to a total non-cognitive situation. He suspects that at the bottom of Dewey's thought there is a contradiction between a naturalism, which puts man and all his experiencing into nature, employing the concepts of organism and environment, and Dewey's other starting-point of "immediate-experience" which he has in common with the later idealism of F. H. Bradley. Santa- yana expresses the same difficulty in his review of Dewey's Experience and Nature resurrected for this volume, and suspects Dewey of standing nature on its head. Taken all in all, The Philosophy of John Dewey reveals that contem-</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 1 25 porary American philosophers are not at all clear as to what Dewey's posi- tion really is. The dialectical materialist inclines to the belief that this is due to Dewey's own attempt, persistent and subtle, to straddle certain basic issues, not dissimilar in some respects to Hegel's quest for a dialectical and objective approach within an idealist framework. Dewey's shifts from such concepts as organism and environment to an immediate experience from which all distinctions, self and object, mind and matter, organism and environment, nature and man, are derived reveal his inability to be genuine- ly materialistic. Even when working in one of these two opposed traditions and placing man in nature, Dewey does so with such a vengeance (cf. Murphy p. 221-3) as to make nature anthropomorphic throughout. The dialectical materialist cannot but believe that if Dewey's empirical natural- ism were what it sometimes claims to be, it would be in no way different from dialectical materialism. Dewey seems to the Marxist more in the tradition of Hume, Kant, Hegel, Mach, and James, than in that of Bacon, Hobbes, Diderot, Holbach, Marx and Engels. In the social sphere this equivocation expresses itself in Dewey's calls for democracy in industry, intelligent social planning, and the like, while yet attacking as anti-individ- ualist and non-intelligent the most important and realistic moves in these directions. Dewey may have helped to lead some people to the gates of the promised land of a democratic and scientific society which he himself, too deeply devoted to the anarchic individualism of a growing American imperialism, will never be privileged to enter.
