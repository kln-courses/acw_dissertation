<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol. 50, No. 2 (Winter 2001 ) Life against Death in Death and Liffe Lyell Asher In the Ayenbite oflnwyt (1340), Dan Michel's translation of the French treatise Le somme des vices et de vertues (1279), the sinner is compared with, among other things, a condemned prisoner dreaming of weddings and feasts, negligently avoiding thoughts of the gallows. The sinners cell is his own corporeal finitude, the gallows his allotted mortality. Implicit in this figure is the caustic suggestion that, since each of us is a sinner destined to die, the world is a kind of death row writ large. The only distinction between in- mates, according to the Ayenbite , is that of those who have faced up to their impending punishment and those who are happy to imagine that present pleasures will last. The happiness of self-delusion qualifies as a vice, just as dread qualifies as a virtue. The gift of dread, says the Ayenbite , is "J)e uerste of ķeyefķes. Petkestout alleķezennesofķeherte He bestrepj) J&gt;e rote of prede" (127). This is a familiar medieval topos : the dread of death as a way of clarifying life, the thought of the body's corruption as a spur to amending the soul. Death, like the dread it occasions, is less cheat than char- ity. "Sum men seiķ ķat déjp is a ķef," runs a fourteenth-century lyric, "And I sey nay and make a pref / Pat deļ) is studefast, trewe and lele" (Brown 148). Johan Huizinga's dark descants helped to make such sentiments seem the dominant disposition of late medieval culture as a whole. "No other age," he wrote, "has so forcefully and continuously impressed the idea of death on the whole population as did the fifteenth century, in which the call of the memento mori echoes throughout the whole of life" (156).1 There is little question that the brevity of life and the horrors of death are prominent themes in many of the surviving artifacts of the late medi- eval imagination. In the funerary monuments and church sculpture, as in the sermons, plays, and poems, death can sometimes seem more palpably present than life itself. However, as often happens in the wake of attempts such as Huizinga's to capture a period by discerning in it a set of dominant dispositions (one thinks of E. R. Dodd's irrational Greeks, Jakob Burckhardt's individualistic Italians), the eye is drawn to exceptions. And where the anon- ymous poem Death and Liffe has been noticed at all, it has often been no- 207</page><page sequence="2">208 Lyell Asher ticed for playing this exceptional role. Not that the form or subject matter of the poem would signal its distinctiveness. On the contrary, Death and Liffe seems readily classifiable, sharing a number of features with other more fa- miliar works from the Alliterative Revival, the most notable of which - Piers Plowman , Winnere and Wastoure, The Parlement of the Thre Ages - have of- ten been proposed as sources for the poem. Though determining specific sources will probably always be an elusive task where Death and Liffe is con- cerned, it seems clear that the poet had a studied acquaintance with the al- literative tradition. Indeed, considering its form, a dream- vision contain- ing the ever-popular conflictus , as well as its ubiquitous theme, the dreadful approach of death, one could hardly imagine a poem that conforms more readily to our expectations of late medieval religious poetry generally. That conformity seems to be all but promised in the prologue of the poem, where we find a dark but familiar triptych: the transience of life, the bliss of heav- en, and the bitterness of hell. Coininge of clearkes, ne cost upon earth, But all wasteth away and worthes to nought When death driveth att the doere with his darts keene; Then noe truse can be taken, noe treasure on earth, But all lordshipps be lost and the liffe both. If thou have pleased the Prince that paradice weldeth, There is noe bearne borne that may they blisse recon; But if thou have wrongffully wrought and will not amend, Thou shalt byterlye bye or else the booke ffayleth. (8-16)2 Amass treasures and titles as you will, none will keep you from hell or ad- mit you to heaven: a common sentiment that forecasts a sternly didactic poem, one employing the carrot of heaven and the stick of hell to steer its audience toward the path of righteousness. Yet the poem that the prologue actually gives way to tends to frustrate our expectations, though it does so in ways that have been welcomed by the poem's handful of critics. In an early essay of 1910, Edith Scamman says that Death and Liffe is "the work of a man desirous of writing a beautiful poem" (103) - an unremarkable desire, one might suppose, except when seen against an austere background of late medieval Christianity. A sense of that austerity is no doubt what prompts a good many other critics to comment on the poem's aesthetic acuity and "artistic merit."3 The poet's aesthetic sen- sibility is not only, or even most remarkably, invested in the poem's formal features, of course, since many medieval poems counsel spareness in highly wrought lines of luxurious language. Rather, it is at work most pointedly on the thematic level, in the poem's surprisingly sympathetic treatment of life's sensuous delights, a treatment that sometimes can be perceived only</page><page sequence="3">Dea th and Liffe 209 by way of the negative - that is, by our being aware that such delights are at least not being condemned with the zeal we might have expected. So struck were James H. Hanford and John M. Steadman, Jr., by this aspect of Death and Liffe that in their 1918 edition of the poem they ascribed to the work a kind of literary historical prescience: "The poet has thus transcended the narrow bounds of medieval ascetic thought, in which all material things are evil and nature itself an ally of Death and Hell, and has unconsciously and half accidentally adopted the more modern point of view, constructing out of purely medieval materials a work which constitutes a dim prophecy of the Renaissance" (245). Few critics today would speak with as much confidence about the distinction between medieval and Renaissance, and in any case there is something dubious about the suggestion that a work which does not conform to our picture of the Middle Ages must hail from some other prov- enance. There is nevertheless something worth pursuing in the very mod- est observation that the author of Death and Liffe has constructed this un- usual work from more or less conventional materials. More might be said about how this actually happens in the poem - specifically, how it is that the poet manages to embrace so convincingly the more worldly aspects of earthly life while using forms and conventions that had seemed, if not antithetical, at least resistant to such an embrace; and how it is, too, that he diminishes the threat of death without simply allying it with the good or making it the just punishment for the wicked. Though the victory of life over death in the poem is ostensibly a doctrinal one, achieved forensically when Lady Liffe defeats Dame Death by reminding her of Christs resurrection, the ground- work for that triumph is laid in subtle ways throughout the poem and in- volves a wide range of minor but significant adjustments to the poetic ma- terials out of which Death and Liffe is composed. The cumulative effect of these adjustments, I suggest, is to disperse Liffe's victory throughout the poem and thus to make her verbal triumph at the poem's end as much a matter of atmosphere as argument, of poetic implication as theological doctrine. Before considering some of the more specific ways in which this happens, it might be useful first to get a picture of the poem as a whole. After the prologue, part of which I have just quoted, the poet tells of falling asleep on a bank of flowers and of having a dream. In that dream he finds himself walking in a "wood strange" on "a great mountaine" (39, 40) and seeing a lavish landscape of beautiful castles and parks, populated by noble lords and ladies. As he admires this panorama, a spectacularly attired woman appears in the east, drawing the attention of everyone and everything around her - from the kings, princes, and dukes to the birds, beasts, and trees. Accompa- nying her are courtiers who represent a wide range of virtues - Sirs Com- fort, Hope, Hind, Liffe, Liking, Love, Cunninge, Curtesye, and Honor - as</page><page sequence="4">210 Lyell Asher well as Dames Mirth, Meekeness, Mercy, Dallyance, and Disport. Their mood is joyful, even festive, and the dreamer is so taken with the scene that he approaches Sir Comfort to ask about the lady at the center of it all. "This is my lady Dame Liffe" (124), comes the reply, and the description that follows identifies her as the vital source of all living things, one who governs "the ground and the greene grasse" (126) and who has all along "ffostered and fifed" the narrator himself (127). The merriment continues, and the narra- tor declares his intention to stay with Dame Liffe "and love her forever" (133). The celebration is interrupted, however, by the sound of "the burlyest blast that euer blowne was" (145), which marks the entrance of Dame Death, who is as foul and misshapen as her counterpart is comely and fair. Attended by a malevolent band of "sorrowfifull souldiers" (184) such as Envy, Anger, Morn- ing, and Mone, she kills 1,500 in a single blow - from kings and princes to "merry maydens" and "Younge children in their craddle" (205, 207). Liffe watches in horror, then confronts Death with the senselessness of her destruc- tion. She denounces her for breaking God's commandments and complains that, although Death will never strike her, since she - Liffe - is "grounded in God" and will "grow for evermore" (289), the misery that death brings to men and women is the work of the devil: she destroys the bonds between people that God has helped to create. Reminding Liffe that such destruc- tion was commissioned by God in the Garden of Eden, Death claims that it is only owing to her own certain arrival that people give glory to God, and that her stroke has laid waste to everyone, from Adam and Eve to Arthur and Hector. Finally, in a moment of hubris, she claims even to have killed Jesus Christ, and this boast proves her undoing. Try as she might, says Liffe, Death actually lost her battle on "the cop of Calvarye" (372). Death did indeed assault Christ on the cross, beating his body, leaving him for dead, and re- turning to hell where she bragged of her victory. "All wounded as hee was" (402), however, Christ followed the Dame, broke asunder the gates of hell, and freed its many captives: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Isaac, David and Daniel, as well as "many deare bearnes / That were put into prison and pained ffull long" (423-24). Announcing that Death was defeated that day, Liffe raises the many dead that Dame Death had slaughtered earlier in the poem and "hyethh over the hills with hundreds ffull manye" (449). At this point, newly confident of death's powerlessness, our dreamer-narrator awakes and ends the poem with a prayer. Prominent among the things that such a summary cannot convey is the poet's attention to physical beauty, on which so many readers of the poem have commented. Indeed, perhaps the first thing to be said about the poem is that, with the notable exception of Dame Death, nothing from the outset is portrayed as anything but delightful to eye and ear. The "bright bowes," "riches of flowers," "redy rayling roses," "sturring streams that streamed fful</page><page sequence="5">Death and Liffe 211 bright" (23, 24, 27) - all of these more or less conventional features of a lo- cus amoenus are described in the first ten lines following the prologue, even before the narrator has fallen asleep and started to dream. Such waking splendor is by no means unique to Death and Liffe . Though dream poems such as The Romance of the Rose and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Book of the Duchess distinguish sharply between the ordinary world of the frame and the extraordinary world of the dream, with the narrator typically falling asleep in a nondescript bed and dreaming his way into paradise, in Wynnere and Wastoure and The Parlement of the ThreAges the narrators waking worlds and dream worlds are both idealized havens of natural beauty, with one lead- ing easily to the other. That said, the Death and Liffe poet seems to take spe- cial pains to make the transition still smoother. This is evident, for exam- ple, in the initial appearance of the word "methought," the verb convention- ally associated with the narration of dreams but first used here in the narra- tion of the frame, as the poet describes how he made his way to the bank on which he eventually falls asleep: Thus ffared I through a ffryth were fflowers were manye; Bright bowes in the banke breathed fftill sweete; The red rayling roses, the riches of fflowers, Layd broad on their bankes with their bright leaves. And a river that was rich runn over the greene With still sturring streames that streamed ffull bright; Over the glittering ground as I there glode, Methought itt lengthened my liffe to looke on the bankes. Then among the fayre flowers I settled me to sitt Under a huge hawthorne that hore was of blossomes. (22-31) "Methought" is appropriate here since it signals that the narrator, though awake, is imagining something incredible - that the sight of these sumptu- ous banks will extend his days, as if he had been admitted to Elysium for as long as he looks. A still more significant effect of the word is the way it adds to the overlap in Death and Liffe between waking and dreaming, an effect furthered by the use of the word a few lines later to narrate the beginning of his vision: "Methought walking that I was in a wood strange" (39). Which is the real world and which the imagined one? WTiere does the actual land- scape leave off and the fanciful one begin? The Death and Liffe poet is in- tent on blurring that distinction, not only by means of the single repetition of a word but also, more generally, by moving extremes toward the middle: he idealizes the real world and realizes the ideal. Surely part of what is sug- gested by this conflation is that a dream world whose many splendors are subject to no restrictions, save those marked out by the limits of a dream- er's imagination, is one to which the world of ordinary experience very fa-</page><page sequence="6">212 Lyell Asher vorably compares. It is not enough, of course, merely to proclaim the astonishing radiance of this everyday world; the Death and Liffe poet feels the necessity of evok- ing it. Consider that exuberant panegyric in which he suggests that the mere sight of the "bankes" seemed to lengthen his life. Though one may exist, I know of no literary precedent for this particular reverie. The poet makes use of a subtle existential insight in the way that he connects a specifically visual splendor with an intimation of immortality. Why there should be such a connection becomes clearer when we consider that sight, in contrast to sound (the harbinger of death in the poem, as we shall see), can seem to suspend temporality. In visual perception an ensemble of objects presents itself to us at once, and in that persistence before our eyes it is possible to imagine these objects in perpetual stasis. When perceiving sound, by con- trast, we are more or less continually aware of the energy or movement re- quired at every moment to sustain it. It is for this reason, argues Hans Jo- nas, that "only sight . . . provides the sensual basis on which the mind may conceive the idea of the eternal, that which never changes and is always present." Jonas goes on to say: The simultaneity of sight is not only of practical advantage, in that it saves the time needed to collect the manifold data successively, but it introduces the beholder to a whole time-dimension otherwise not disclosed to him, namely, the presen řas something more than the point-experience of the pass- ing now The time thus taken in taking-in the view is not experienced as the passing away of contents before new ones in the flux of events, but as a lasting of the same, an identity which is the extension of the instantaneous now and therefore unmoved, continued present - so long as no change oc- curs in the objects themselves. When it does, then time starts rolling visual- ly. (145) If we return to the passage just quoted from Death and Liffe with these re- marks in mind, we notice that in the lines leading up to the intimation of longer life we are presented with a striking contrast. On the one hand, there are the sound and movement of the running river, the stirring streams, and the ambling narrator; on the other, there is the still tableau of the banks embroidered with flowers and leaves. In Jonas's terms, temporal flux is set off against a perpetual now, a continued present that prompts in the narra- tor - and in the reader - thoughts of eternity and the divine. A significant counterpart to this contrast appears a few lines later in the poem when the narrator, now asleep and dreaming, sees another luminous bank. Here again the bank supplies a kind of stationary backdrop against which we see another figure in motion:</page><page sequence="7">Death and Liffe 213 There ouer that oste estward I looked into a boolish banke, the brightest of other, that shimered and shone as the sheere heauen throughe the light of a Ladye hat longed therin. Shee came cheereing ffull comlye with companye noble, Upon cleare clothes, were all of cleare gold, Layd brode upon the ben with brawders ffull riche, Before that ffayre on the ffeeld, where shee fforth passed. Shee was brighter of her blee then was the bright sonn, Her rudd redder then the rose that on the rise hangeth, Meekely smiling with her mouth and merry in her lookes, Ever laughing for love, as shee like wold. (57-68) If this "boolish banke" of the poet's dream intensifies the timeless aspect of the bank that had so captured his attention while he was awake, then Lady Liffe (as she will soon be identified) intensifies the temporal aspect of near- ly everything else. She is exuberantly alive and endowed with both motions and emotions that are remarkable partly for being so ordinary: though a goddess, she steps forth from this bank "cheereing ffull comlye," "[m]eekely smiling," "merry in her lookes," and "laughing for love." Indeed, if we remem- ber the imaginative latitude that the genre of the dream-vision affords, it is possible to see in this description of Liffe, fluorescent and fanciful though it is, not only a relative economy of expression but also genuine restraint. For example, though evident enough in the reference to looking "estward" toward a bank that "shone as the sheere heauen," Life's connections with the divine are relatively subdued in this description. If she is God's emissary, that alliance is not at this point in the poem allowed to upstage her own very remarkable power and presence. And brilliant as that presence is ("Shee was brighter of her blee then was the bright sonn"), it is by no means so tran- scendent as to be overwhelming. The narrator can evidently look directly at her and calmly register her features, something that her buoyant demeanor seems even to invite. These characteristics are worth remarking because of the way they diverge from those of the figure that Hanford once proposed as the proximate source for Lady Liffe, the goddess Natura of Alanus de Insulis. Regardless of whether one accepts Hanford's proposal (and few critics have), Alanus's goddess pro- vides a useful background against which to measure Liffe's own particular characteristics. There is no question that the two figures resemble one an- other in significant ways. Both goddesses are spectacular in both face and bodily form; both effect the spontaneous rejuvenation of the plants and animals near them; and both are attired in dress symbolic of their relation to the cosmos. However, the most obvious and revealing distinction between the two figures has to do with Alanus's poetic largess: whereas the Death and</page><page sequence="8">214 Lyell Asher Liffe poet constructs his goddess in a dozen or so lines, Alanus takes more than 500. In fact, one of the foremost principles guiding Nature's presenta- tion seems to have been an intellectual and rhetorical copiousness that tries to mimic the complex fecundity of the natural world itself. The result is a dazzling, if at times unwieldy, collage of symbols and conceits expressing the myths and principles that structure nothing less than the created world. The complexity of this allegorical pageant is by no means gratuitous: the disci- plined intellect required to interpret such an elaborate iconography is pre- cisely the same intellect that enables man to approach the Godhead. So it is, then, that the tongue-lashing the narrator receives for failing to recognize Nature - "What blindness of ignorance . . . what failing of the senses, what infirmity of the reason has placed a cloud on thine understanding ... so that not only thine intellect is cheated out of its quick recognition of thy Nour- ishes but that also thy power of discerning . . . suffers a collapse at thy very appearance" (3.21-30) - becomes a general lecture on good and evil: "Now the latter, lust, leads the human mind into the ruin of vices, so that it per- ishes; the former, reason, bids it, as it rises, to ascend to the serenity of vir- tue" (3.94-99). Recognizing Nature as well as divine truth is contingent upon the subjugation of the senses to the intellect; reason unhindered by the temp- tations of the flesh is a puzzle piece for the metaphysical and spiritual truth that stands behind mere appearance. Not that God and Nature are for Ala- nus indistinguishable - indeed, Nature herself readily admits that she is the "lowly disciple of the Supreme Ruler" (3.205). Even so, the chasm between her domain - "the innermost sanctuaries of heavenly mystery" - and man's "common brothel" is formidable, one that she crosses only when forced by the carelessness, unjustness, and "disorder in the ordering of the world" (4.5- 8). The geometry of that crossing is distinctly vertical ("a woman glided down from an inner palace of the impassible world and could be seen has- tening her steps in my direction"), and when she speaks we discover just how otherworldly she is: "She depicted for my mental perception the image of a real voice, and by this brought into actual being words which had been, so to speak, archetypes ideally preconceived" (3.16-20). If Alanuss Nature is distinguished by her complexity, however, Lady Liffe is distinguished by her simplicity. We have seen that the narrator in Alanus s Complaint collapses - "prostrated by stupor of mind" (3.8) - at the sight of Nature, uncertain of exactly what he has seen. Though he describes her ret- rospectively in great detail, he is unable to draw from these particulars a unifying principle that could disclose a coherent identity. There is, on the other hand, an immediate accessibility about Liffe. The descriptions of both her approach and her apparel are brief by comparison. Her mantle, for ex- ample, the counterpart to which had taken up some fifty lines of exposition in the Complaint , is not given direct attention in Death and Liffe but men-</page><page sequence="9">Death and Liffe 215 tioned incidentally, almost as an afterthought: Then that lo[v]ly ladye, on land where shee standeth, That was comelye cladd in kirtle 8c mantle Of goodlyest greene that euer groome ware, For the kind of that cloth can noe clarke tell; And shee the most gracyous groome that on the ground l[e]nged (82-86) The confusion elicited by Nature s mystical appearance is replaced here by wonder at a simpler, more basic form of splendor. Liffe is extraordinary without being extra-earthly: her mantle and her graciousness are praised in the superlative, but she remains a "groome," God s creature, very much at home in this world. Indeed, though V. A. Kolve in a brief remark on the poem assumes that "Life is sent from Heaven to dispute with a brazen, personified Death" (195), the poet actually avoids directly suggesting either that she has been specially sent or that her domain is anywhere other than the earth. The proximity of her dwelling is matched by the accessibility of her person. In contrast to a figure whose identity as the great Nourisher is discerned pri- marily by the focused attention of the intellect, Lady Liffe reveals her pow- ers of nourishment in the most sensual manner possible - in an appeal to sight and to instinct: And the colour of her kirtle was caruen ffull lowe, That her blisfull breastes bearnes might behold, With a naked necke that neighed her till, That gaue light on the land as [l]eames of the sunn. (89-92) Though the corruption of this passage's third line makes it hard to say any- thing specific about the tone - or even the sense - of this reference to Liffe's "naked necke," the ambiguity of the word "bearnes" (meaning both "child" and "man") makes the exposure of her breasts a gesture that is simultaneously maternal and sexual. We can safely assume that Liffe is meant to be chaste, but the poet does not go out of his way to say so, and that helps to bolster the impression that this poem does not conceive as threatening either sexu- ality in particular or sensuality in general. Such an impression becomes still clearer when we recall Alanus's more modest description of a Nature whose countenance revealed that "the key of Dione's daughter had not opened the lock of her chastity" and whose body is concealed by a "damask tunic" upon which there is embroidered a picture of man "having laid aside the idleness of sensuality, and by the direct guidance of reason penetrated the secrets of the heavens" (1.344-46). To be sure, in the opening lines of Alanus's descrip- tion Nature's own erotic attractions are fully cataloged. With her full lips,</page><page sequence="10">216 Lyell Asher ivory teeth, rosy cheeks, slender neck, and apple-like breasts, Nature is as well put together as any Petrarchan mistress. But that, in a way, is precisely the point. Like Laura, she is less an animate whole than a brittle assembly of parts. The physical aspects of this assembly are of no particular concern to Alanus except as a peg on which to hang the elaborately symbolic diadem and dress that is the primary focus of his descriptive energy. This is not to imply that the Death and Liffe poet elevates sensuality at the expense of reason; it is only to suggest that he avoids the issue by never emphasizing the distinction in the first place. In fact, this tendency to unify rather than separate is one of the poem's most consistent and subtle defens- es against Death's onslaught. Earlier I described the celebration of Liffe's approach by flora and fauna alike as being more or less conventional, and so it is. Alanus s Complaint and Chaucers The Parlement of Foules both in- clude such scenes, and both have been mentioned as possible sources for the choreography of Lady Liffe's entrance. The similarities notwithstanding, a distinctive feature of this scene in Death and Liffe has to do with its inclu- siveness, the fact that the poem joins the natural and human worlds. Whereas the comparable scenes in both Complaint and Parlement make man an ex- cluded observer rather than an active participant, here the emphasis is on confluence and sympathy between man and nature. The first familiar steps in constructing this amalgam are the anthropomorphized gestures given to both plants and animals: Blossomes &amp; burgens breathed ffull sweete, Fflowers flourished in the frith where she fforth steppedd, And the, grasse that was gray greened beliue. Breme birds on the boughes busilye did singe And all the wild in the wood winlye the ioyed. (71-75) Again, this is a precedented tableau, but it is worth noting that these floral and faunai gestures of supplication immediately precede those of the human beings, a juxtaposition that, in addition to narrowing the distance between the two worlds, indirectly suggests by virtue of its sequence that human so- ciety may be imitating the natural one rather than the other way around. First , the polite trees "lowted to that ladye and layd forth their branches"; then, a few lines later, Kings kneeled on their knees, knowing that lady, And all the princes in the presse and the proud dukes, Barrons and bachelours, all they bowed ffull lowe; All profrereth her to please, the pore and the riche. (76-79) Anthropomorphism works a certain poetic charm of its own, of course, but</page><page sequence="11">Death and Liffe 217 in the context of what is to come it takes part in a larger thematic strategy: the attempt to unify divergent forms of life in opposition to mortality. On the most basic level this collectivity simply produces strength in numbers. To give plants and animals human qualities is to solidify and enlarge the liv- ing family against which Death must assert herself. But on another level, the more important one it seems, this unity strengthens Life's case against Death by qualitative rather than quantitative means. To the extent that human beings are consolidated with Nature, they regain the primitive innocence that, in the Edenie myth, had insulated them from sin and death. A fair amount of medieval writing and sermonizing, after all, had drawn invidi- ous distinctions between the human and natural worlds: whereas Nature is obedient, orderly, and comely, man is recalcitrant, confused, and unseemly. Eustache Deschamps was invoking what was already, in the late fourteenth century, a "stereotyped comparison between plants and men," according to Jean Delumeau, when he wrote: "Shameful human condition, / Which al- ways errs! / Trees bear fruit, flower and leaf: / You bear / Lice, worms, and nits" (47-48). With Natures innocence so well established, an alliance could prove as beneficial as the opposition had been baleful, and this is just what Death and Liffe exploits. Human beings in this poem are as little deserving of death as the birds or the grasses. The title "the great leveler" that so often describes Death s indiscriminate slaughter is transformed here into a title that characterizes Life's universal appeal, an appeal uniting all types of living beings, "both barnes &amp; birds, beastes and fowles" (81) and all classes of men and women - "all profrereth her to please, the pore and the riche" (79). This inclusiveness that the poem celebrates among the various personae is also at work within them, as we see in the group of virtues accompanying Lady Liffe. Hope, Honor, Liking, Love, and Curtesye are to be expected among her retinue, as are Hind, meaning "pleasant" or "gracious," and Cun- ninge, which as yet carries only the positive connotations associated with knowledge and skill. To a surprising extent, however, in Death and Liffe worldly enthusiasms take their place alongside heavenly ones; figures rep- resenting spiritual rectitude, such as Hope, Honor, and Mercy, find their complements in those representing a more mundane vitality that had gen- erally been treated with less tolerance elsewhere. Mirth, for example, is as- sociated with a frivolous neglect of Christian duty in The Pride of Life but is included here without apology in Liffe's coterie. And Pleasure, who along with Folly and Dress represent the King's sinful attachment to worldly goods in The Castle of Perseverance, finds his parallel here in two figures, Dallyance and Disport, who are unashamedly allied with the virtuous Lady Liffe. This is by no means the predominant morality turned on its head. Vices do not simply become virtues. It is rather a change of emphasis, a shift away from the ascetic attitude that aligns the pleasures of this world with the Cardinal</page><page sequence="12">218 Lyell Asher Sins, thereby accentuating their potential for abuse, to an attitude that re- casts pleasure as appropriate and even pious delight in Goďs creation. What all of this adds up to is a poem that so conspicuously foregrounds the innocent richness of life on earth that the general character of Death is already determined, via negativa , in the first half of the poem. Before Death appears, we can be reasonably certain that she will take neither the form of Goďs henchman dispatched to dole out the wages of sin, the role played by the Divine Messenger Death in Everyman , nor even the more neutral form, exemplified in The Castle of Perseverance, of one who functions simply as the means by which sinning and the Pride of Life are brought to a halt. When she finally appears, Death herself tries to claim these roles in order to legit- imize her own existence, but we know that she will do so to no avail: char- acterized by such goodness and grace, Life has as its destroyer a figure nec- essarily allied with evil. That alliance remains implicit in the first half of the poem but finds an emphatic confirmation in Lady Liffe's first words to her adversary: "Thou woeful wretch, weaknesse of care, bold birth full of bale, bringer of sorrowe, dame daughter of the devili, Death is thy name" (233- 35). Even here, though, the poet defers the actual naming until the last moment and, in so doing, produces a miniature version of Death's narra- tive treatment thus far in the poem. An apparently objective description precedes a specific identification and thus evades some of the traditional associations that had gathered around the figure of Death for the better part of a millennium. It is often observed that these associations became particularly vivid in the late Middle Ages, owing in part to the rhythmic and widespread ravages of the plague. Though more varied in form than critics have sometimes cared to admit, these treatments are broadly consistent in portraying deaths cunning approach and irresistible power. Chaucer's characterization of an unseen "privee theef" warns of mortality's unpredictability, while the wormy corpse of The Massacre of the Innocents sounds a standard alarm about its inevitability: Amonges wormys, as I gow telle, Undyr ķ&gt;e erthe xul ge dwelle, and thei xul Etyn both flesche and felle, As pei have don me. (281-84) In the popular danse macabre these two themes find their most balanced expression. In John Lydgate's version the unpredictability of Death's arrival is lamented in the poignant cry of the child: "I cam but nowe / and nowe I goo my way" (589). Death may strike anyone at any time, warns the infant, "a gonge man as an olde" (592). If the time of the assault is mysterious,</page><page sequence="13">Death and Liffe 219 however, the inevitability of its coming is not. Wherever Death was portrayed as a skeleton, mortality's ultimate arrival was made as certain and as intimate as our own physical make-up: Death is something that already lies within each of us, an assembly of bones waiting to make its obtrusive appearance. In a particularly apt phrase of William Herbert, "Deth is hud, mon, in 1&gt;y glove." Implicit in all such representations are the damning words inscribed beneath the skeleton in Masaccio's famous fresco of the Trinity: "Io fu ga quel che voi siete e quel che son voi aco sarete " ("I was what you are, and what I am you will be"). Without directly downplaying deaths obvious threat, Death and Liffe nevertheless turns many of these associations on their heads. For example, instead of the silent thief whose most potent weapon is surprise, Death an- nounces herself by a horn - by "the burlyest blast that euer blowne was." Though such a report evokes a certain terror of its own, it goes a long way toward alleviating the anxiety that only an invisible enemy can produce. Then too there is Jonass point that sound, as opposed to sight, impresses upon us its temporality. If sounds come and go, second by second, then Death - like the blast that announces her arrival - might be a temporary phenomenon. Moreover, in contrast to those representations that mimic our future state in the form of a corpse or a skeleton, Dame Death is not a rep- resentation of the body's inevitable corruption but is rather the "ffoulest ffreake," whose grotesqueness lies in deformed, not decayed, features. While some physical details do suggest a corpse (e.g., the cold pallor of the face that looks like "lead that latelye was beaten" [170] ), Death s long teeth, wide lips, and horrible nose do not really foreshadow our own inevitable corruption in the grave but suggest instead an obtrusive alien who can now at least be confronted. This is not to suggest that the poet in any way trivializes death 's destruc- tive force. Indeed, when Death kills 1,500 in a single blow, we may assume that the poet is portraying its wholesale slaughter in a way that medieval men and women experienced firsthand. Nonetheless, the mention of a specific number - and a high one at that - has its own rather peculiar effect, one that we may not have anticipated. Had the poet intended to evoke real horror in his portrayal of Death, he would have drawn from the homiletic literature of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, literature that, like the ghastly sermons of the mendicant friars, was designed to scare the refractory sin- ner into righteousness. Had he done so, the attention given to destruction en masse would have been given instead to death as it affects the individual. By refusing to take the more popular route, the poet leaves us with a picture of Deaths unmitigated destruction that tends less toward the particular than the abstract, appealing less to the emotional response to physical decay than to the intellectual grasp of a statistic: we can understand that Death "fell att</page><page sequence="14">220 Lyell Asher the first fflappe 1500" (201) but probably find it impossible to visualize the feat. Granted, we are told how she "dang out the braynes" (204) of dukes and how "merry maydens on the mold shee mightilye killethe" (205), but with that the description is at its most explicit. Though the Death and Liffe poet uses the idea to achieve the opposite effect, he was no doubt privy to the insight exploited by friars who were skilled at exacting payment from those terrified by human mortality. The poet also knew that, if a statistical abstraction reduces death's per- sonal threat, it does so by heightening the more general one. The attack on the individual is not subdued entirely, then, but deflected toward life in gen- eral - toward Lady Liffe herself: "Thy bliss is my bale breuelye of others, / there is no game vnder heauen soe gladlye I wishe / as to haue a slapp with my ffawchyon att thy fayre state" (282-85). In the lines following Death's threat, however, Lady Liffe responds that, no matter how successful the at- tacks might be, the victory will always be less than absolute. "Then Liffe on the land ladylike shee speakes: sayth, / 'These words thou hast wasted, way- te thou no other; / Shall thy bitter brand neuer on my body byte'" (286-88). The indestructibility of the life force is a defense that dates back at least as far as Aristotle, who in De Anima concludes that, although the individual dies, the species survives. In this context the idea's immediate source for the Death and Liffe poet may be this declaration from The Romance of the Rose : "Nature works new creatures to create / So that when all of them shall come to death / They will leave others still alive" (15,998-16,000). Death is not really defeated by such regeneration, only stalled indefinitely. While this may have offered comfort theoretically, the realization that "life will go on" can offer little consolation to the individual who is to be left behind. If the death of 1 ,500 has been so abstract as to have insulated us from any personal threat, the survival of the race at the expense of our own existence insulates us, for the same reason, from any personal comfort. The poet's strategy, however, is not simply to ignore what is likely to be the most pressing issue, the individual's encounter with his or her own mor- tality, but to handle it in the right way. As we have seen, the macabre senti- ment at its most pointed makes tangible the hour of doom, yet it does so in a manner that heightens the fear of one's own death and physical decay, while it neglects the fuller range of emotions aroused by death as actually experi- enced in the passing of those around us. It is precisely this latter experience that Lady Liffe captures when she transforms the anonymity of 1,500 into a more palpable image - one not of wormy flesh but of the singular tragedy suffered when a loved one is removed from our midst: Where ioy &amp; gentlenesse are ioyned together Betweene [a] wight &amp; his wiffe and his winne children,</page><page sequence="15">Death and Liffe 221 And when ffaith &amp; ffellowshipp are ffastened ffor aye, Loue &amp; [le]a[u]tye, which our Lord likethe, Then thou waleth them with wracke &amp; wratheffiilly beginneth; Vncurteouslye thou cometh, vnknowne of them all, And lacheth away the [lord] that the [land] holdeth, Or woryes his wiffe or waits downe his children. Mikle woe thus thou waketh where mirth was before. (292-300) This could perhaps caption a number of scenes from the various death danc- es except for one important difference: here our attention is focused on the survivor rather than the victim. From the most modest portraits in the danse macabre to the most terrifying ones in the elaborate paintings of the Last Judgment, the portraits of Death's victims have as their underlying theme the vanity of the inherently corrupt earthly enterprise. Even in that touch- ing scene of Lydgate's, Death tells the infant not to mourn his fate but to be thankful that the worlds evils will no longer afflict him: "Late eueri wight haue this yn remembraunce / Who lengest leueth moste shal suffire wo" (583- 84). If we are to pity the parents, we should not do so because they have lost their child but, according to this passage, because they are not as fortunate as he. But a wider conception of life distinguishes the Death and Liffe poet, just as it so often distinguishes Homer. Diomedes' response to Glaucus' chal- lenge, after all, is not "Unhappy are those who face my might" but "Unhap- py are those whose children face my might." This is death understood from the point of view of time rather than eternity, the here and now rather than the hereafter. No matter how sympathetic, concern for those left mourning in this world can offer little comfort to those who wonder what their fate will be in the next. That the poet shows this concern at all, however, suggests some- thing about his vision of the afterlife and anticipates his version of Christs Harrowing of Hell. Having granted importance to the splendor of this world, the poet will not want to see punished those who do likewise. Even for those poets who emphasize Gods mercy, the Harrowing of Hell is still another op- portunity to stress the importance of living an austere, if not ascetic, Chris- tian life. In contrast, the Death and Liffe poet suppresses any reference to original sin and mans "just" condemnation, or even to a Purgatory where punishment, though severe, is at least mitigated. In Piers Plowman , of course, we see both mercy and condemnation. Acknowledging Satan's proper claim, Christ says: "Alķoug Reson recorde, and rigt of myselve, / That if 1&gt;ei ete ķe Appui alle shoulde deye, / 1 bihigte hem nogt here helle for evere" (18.330- 32). Since Adam and Eve were deceived, eternal damnation would be un- fair: "They shul be clensed clerliche and keuered of hir synnes / In my pris- one Purgatorie til parce it hote" (18.391-92). In Death and Liffe , however, there is no qualification of Christ's mercy,</page><page sequence="16">222 Lyell Asher only a complete denunciation of the claims of both Death and Satan. It is a denunciation so complete, in fact, that "mercy" hardly seems the right word. The gravely judicious Christ of Piers Plowman who had been so careful to justify his actions is replaced here by a figure too angry for diplomacy, giv- en less to debate than to old-fashioned fisticuffs: "He leapt vnto Lucifer that Lord himselfe; / then he went to the tower where chaynes were manye, / &amp; bound him soe biglye that hee for bale rored" (416-18). The corresponding scene in many of the English morality plays has Satan making a final appeal for his just due, and, though typically overruled on biblical grounds, his arguments are at least given a hearing. Doctrinal matters play no part in this version of the confrontation, however, and the effect is to suggest that man's salvation is won as much by natural as by divine right; negotiations are out of the question for the simple reason that there is not now, nor has there ever been, anything to negotiate. From the very beginning Satan's imprisonment of those from "the old world" has been a false one, Liffe's narration implies, for it is without the slightest hesitation that Christ frees the captives, award- ing them and, by proxy, everyone else unconditional, eternal life: "Hee be- tooke me the treasure that neuer shall haue end, / That neuer danger of death shold me deere after" (425-26). A few lines later Liffe does mention that each of her children should "in your creede beleeue," but by now much of the force of this creed lies in what is primarily a negative instruction simply to disbe- lieve in the power of Satan and Death. It is, after all, a lie that leads to the latter's defeat in the poem, and not just because it allows Liffe to recount Christ's triumph. The Resurrection could have been brought up at any time, but only after Death's misstatement does the time seem appropriate: "Dame Death, of thy deeds now is thy doome shapen / Through they wittles words that thou hast warped, / Which thou makest with thy mouth &amp; mightylye avowes" (361-63). Why this em- phasis on Death's "witless words"? Why is Liffe's victory made to turn on her opponent's solecism? Of course, part of the answer may lie in the in- creased dramatic effect gained when Death's outrageous claim is so easily and emphatically overturned. A more important reason reveals itself, however, when we understand Death's miscue not simply as a temporary lapse that allows for a quick conclusion to the debate but as a manifestation of what, in the poet's mind, lies at the very heart of Death's terrible power - decep- tion. Exposing the fact that she has lied is as important as showing what, in this specific instance, she has lied about, since this one indictment casts a suspicious shadow on everything she has said or implied thus far. Signifi- cantly this includes the long-standing assumption on which much if not all of Death's argument depends - namely, that the body and the soul are in perpetual opposition since each belongs to a different realm. Christ's Har- rowing of Hell, though, has been in the name of both the natural and the</page><page sequence="17">Death and Liffe 223 supernatural, earthly life and heavenly being, so that by the end of her nar- rative Liffe herself seems to have forgotten which is which. Lady Liffe is now the equivalent of life everlasting: "'Death was damned that day, daring ffull still. / Shee hath n [e] might, nay no maine, to meddle with yonder ost, / Against eurlasting Liffe that Ladye soe true'" (442-44). Perhaps as much as anything else, the value of trying to ignore such dis- tinctions rather than arguing directly against them is what Death and Liffe exemplifies. The formal conflictus takes up a substantial portion of the work, but it is only the most explicit part of a subtler debate that runs throughout the entire poem. Deployed on rhetorical rather than strictly theological grounds, the poeťs strategy in this larger debate involves adjusting a network of associations that had made overcoming mortality somehow contingent upon rejecting the pleasures of earthly existence. Part of what is implied by such an adjustment is that the perennial obsession with unveiling a transcen- dent order could stand being tempered with an attentiveness to form, to appearance, to the veil itself, and that this latter enterprise need not hinder but could actually enliven the former. As it is presented here, the task of the Christian s life is not to eliminate earthly passions and attachments but to reunite them with the good, and everything in the poem conspires to achieve this integration of heaven and earth. Even that last image of Lady Liffe dis- appearing over the hills draws the poets attention to a place that, though at some distance beyond, will never be entirely above him: "All the dead on the [d]oun doughtilye shee rayseth, / Fairer by 2-ffold then they before were. / With that shee hyeth over the hills with hundreds ffull manye" (447-49).
