<plain_text><page sequence="1">Convergences and Divergences Between Phenomenological Psychology and Behaviorism: A Beginning Dialogue Amedeo Giorgi Duquesne University I. Introduction The major purpose of this article is to see to what extent the internal movements and developments of phenomenological and behavioristic thought and praxis in psychology may be converging despite the different language sytems that are employed and despite the fact that some honest differences may remain. The most popular knowledge of the relationship between phenomenology and behaviorism is based upon the Rice Sym posium edited by Wann (1964), and there the two systems were contrasted. Due to the fact that there is greater awareness of the more precise meaning of phenomenology among American psychologists and to the fact that radical behaviorism has emerged as a distinct movement within behaviorism, there may be reason to reinvestigate the relation ship between phenomenology and behaviorism and see to what extent the "contrasting" relation still holds. Two prefatory comments are in order. The first deals with a clarification of just what we are comparing. I distinguish between phenomenology, as a philosophy, and a phenomenologically based psychology. In the history of the phenomenological move ment, the philosophy has been more richly developed and more extensively elaborated, whereas the psychological development has only begun. With behaviorism there is the psychological movement which began with Watson (1913) and there is also the philosophy of behaviorism. It seems to me that the reverse is true here. The psychological development, the method, is older and more extensively elaborated, whereas explicit development of the implicit philosophy behind the movement is just beginning. I will try to keep distinct these four different phenomena, for a mixing of them can only lead to trouble, as I will show later. In my own terminology, I call the philosophical considera tions the approach, and reserve the term method for concrete research applications (Giorgi, 1970a). My second point is simply that I shall not try to speak for behaviorism. My experience in reading accounts of phenomenology by non-phenomenologists is always one of not recognizing what I mean by phenomenology, and I think it must of necessity be that way unless one is deeply versed in both movements. I am sure that behaviorists have had 200</page><page sequence="2">Amedeo Giorgi similar experiences with respect to behaviorism so I shall not add to the confusion. I am not an expert on behaviorism for the simple reason that keeping up on phenomenological literature takes up just about all the time I have. I know behaviorism more by osmosis and atmosphere in the sense that anyone trained in psychology in 20th Century America could hardly escape it, but I have not pursued it in any conscious way as a specialty. Precisely because of this, dialogue is necessary, and that is why this one is being initiated. What I will present then is admittedly a phenomenologist's understanding of behaviorism and even then I present it only when a comparison of interpretations becomes necessary for certain arguments. Hopefully, responses by behaviorists in these pages will clarify whatever distortions are unintendedly present. I will begin, however, with some general convergences that I see between phenomenology and behaviorism, as one way of clarifying some possible misunderstandings of phenomenology and then I will present a phenomenological viewpoint on behavior. In other words, what I really want to do is provide some ground for a dialogue so that our mutual understandings can be enriched. II. Convergences Both phenomenologists and radical behaviorists are against dualisms, both of the world, i.e., a physical real world and its duplications in terms of representations in a mind, and of man, i.e., a real man that is visible to everyone and then an "inner man" consisting of conscious states of which he alone is aware. Both are against that form of positivistic theory of science that espouses the hypothetico-deductive method, which therefore includes a large part of traditional American psychology. Both are against those forms of reductionism that try to interpret behavior in terms of physiology, neurology or introspectionist mentalism. In terms of what they are for, both agree that research in depth with one or few subjects is a legitimate way of doing research ? if not the only way. Both agree that behavior should be approached descriptively and both agree that theory should be minimized and used very cautiously. These are agreements that in my opinion stem from the approach of both behaviorism and phenomenology. Still, one must be cautious here for I am not so sure that the agreements that I have just mentioned are all for the same reasons, and secondly, I know for sure that the praxis that would flow from this set of agreements would not be identical. Lastly, I am not sure to what extent phenomenology and radical behaviorism share methodological or content values in a clarified and rigorous sense. That is, while they both can affirm behavior, the meanings assigned to the term may be so different that we have only a verbal similarity. In order to bring out some of the possible differences, I shall discuss a couple of articles that try to mediate between phenomenology and behaviorism from a behavioristic perspective. III. Phenomenology and Behaviorism From Viewpoint of Behaviorism Brody and Oppenheim (1966, 1967) compared phenomenology and methodological behaviorism as bases for psychology and in the comparison it was phenomenology that suffered most. Brody and Oppenheim write: We shall define pure phenomenological psychology (ppp) by its subject matter and by its method of investigation. The subject matter of ppp is all of experience. It is the intent of ppp to study that which is immediately given in experience. . . . 201</page><page sequence="3">Ph?nom?nologie al Psychology and Behaviorism: A Beginning Dialogue The ppp studies the data of experience by a method which invokes the suspension of implicit and explicit assumptions. (Brody and Oppenheim, 1966, p. 295) The authors work through more distinctions and elaborations, and finally end up with the following conclusion: "As mentioned previously, ppp cannot be used as a basis for the construction of theories, nor, as we see now, for the purpose of testing any scientific statement, and ppp cannot even be used as a means of describing experience. Thus, on the view presented here, ppp is not relevant per se for scientific psychology" (Brody and Oppenheim, 1966, p. 301). Since I have written a more detailed critique of this article elsewhere (Giorgi, 1970b) I shall limit myself here to the reasons why I think Brody and Oppenheim arrived at such an evaluation of phenomenological psychology. Firstly, it will be noted that Brody and Oppenheim make no mention of approach. They purportedly use only method and subject matter to evaluate phenomenology and methodological behaviorism. But, im plicitly, they draw criteria from unspecified aspects of the positivistically-oriented philosophy of methodological behaviorism and judge both methodological behaviorism and phenomenological psychology from that frame of reference. (For example, the philosophers Brody and Oppenheim cite are, among others, Ayer, Carnap, Hempel, Northrop, etc.) Since methodological behaviorism flows from that particular philosophy of science and phenomenological psychology does not, obviously methodological behaviorism comes out better. Phenomenological psychology could draw criteria from a phenomenologically grounded philosophy of science which would make phenomenological psychology look better than methodological behaviorism, but the point is that the debate should not criss-cross like that; it should be approach vs. approach or method vs. method, but not the approach of one philosophy versus the method derived from another. Actually Brody and Oppenheim event went a step further and placed the restraints of "pure" and "logical extreme" on ppp?that is, they argued the phenomenological perspective from those viewpoints but did not place similar restraints on methodological behaviorism. If one chose to, one could make methodologi cal behaviorism "pure," call it pmb and push it to its "logical extreme" and then show how ineffective it would be; but then that wouldn't be fair. In any event, my first objection is that Brody and Oppenheim ignore the role of approach in an explicit sense and then use it implicitly to their advantage. Secondly, there is a way one could even accept Brody and Oppenheim's description of ppp, if interpreted correctly or sympathetically. But Brody and Oppenheim do not do that. They in no way interpret experience as intentional, which is absolutely essential for the phenomenologist. They treat it as though it were an entity in itself, and this interpretation does lead to problems. For the phenomenologist, experience is always intentional, which means that it is relational and transitive; it is always experience of. . . something. And the something of which it is the experience never belongs to the experience itself ? the phenomenologist says that the object of the experience belongs to the world. It is always the world that we experience. Brody and Oppenheim do not give that interpretation to experience and so for them the experience becomes a kind of self-enclosed elusive state; that of course does lead to difficulties. Thirdly, Brody and Oppenheim then say that the phenomenologist is interested in immediate experience. They diminish even further the narrow interpretation that they 202</page><page sequence="4">Amedeo Giorgi gave to experience by trying to limit it to the instant, and when they further note that "that which is immediately given in experience . . ." is to be described "by a method which invokes the suspension of implicit and explicit assumptions" (Brody and Oppenheim, 1966, p. 296), they hasten to add that "by characterizing ppp in this way, it is not implied that it is ever possible to have a purely nonconceptualized experience. But the method of ppp implies that one can approximate such an experience" (Brody and Oppenheim, 1966, p. 296). It is no wonder that they conclude that ppp is irrelevant for science. If that were the true understanding of phenomenology, I would agree. But the above is only a caricature of phenomenology. Brody and Oppenheim understand the key concepts with which they are dealing in an implicit positivistic sense and then apply their understanding of the phenomenological method to the implicit positivistic understanding of the key concepts (e.g., experience, immediate). What they present is an interpretation of experience, not a description of it. Brody and Oppenheim forget that for phenomenologists the structure of experience, or consciousness, is such that we are never reduced to the instant (see Merleau-Ponty, 1962, pp. 57-63). Its retentional and protentional characteristics always insure that we are present to a larger segment of time. Moreover, phenomenologists say that they begin with immediate experience, rather than limit themselves to it. They realize that phenomena in the world have a ground or horizon that takes time to unfold, and moreover that there is always something "horizonally present" no matter how long it takes to be unfolded. Lastly, with respect to bracketing of presuppositions, Brody and Oppenheim force phenomenologists to swallow an ideal. The phenomenologist's moti vation for presuppositionlessness is no different than Skinner's; too often psychologists substitute theoretical constructs for concrete descriptions, hence in order to be sure that one is not unwittingly employing a theory rather than a description, one should move very slowly and be sure of the guidelines for description. But the phenomenologist has realized that absolute presuppositionlessness is impossible and that the next best thing is to make as articulate as possible the assumptions associated with the perspective that one does assume. Brody and Oppenheim indicate no recognition of this movement in phenomenological thought. The second article I would like to consider is that written by Day (1969) where he compares phenomenology with radical behaviorism. It seems to me that Day's approach is much more cautious, open and sympathetic. I will first consider the section in which he explicitly dialogues with phenomenology, then give my version of the practical problems of reconciliation, and lastly speak to his exposition of radical behaviorism.1 Day's first point is that radical behaviorism "presses for the more explicit study of phenomenological functional relationships" (Day, 1969, p. 324) and gives as one example of a phenomenological subject matter Skinner's chapter on "Private Events in a M am aware that Day has in press a more extended and later version of radical behaviorism, but I have not as yet had time to study it. Moreover, to incorporate that statement into this article may mean a neglect of the earlier article but I want to be sure that the transition from phenomenology and behavior as "contrasting" viewpoints to a "convergent" viewpoint is duly noted. Brody and Oppenheim still contrast the two viewpoints and talk about the difficulties of rapprochement and only seriously consider terminological rapprochement. In any event, the intention is to respond to Day's later article at another time and that is why included in the title of this article is the expression "A Beginning Dialogue." 203</page><page sequence="5">Phenomenological Psychology and Behaviorism: A Beginning Dialogue Natural Science," and then goes on to say: "What is needed is extensive descriptive analysis of verbal behavior controlled by observable events that are likely to be identified by the speaker as his own conscous experience, his inner subjective feelings or his private hopes, fears, and aspirations" (Day, 1969, p. 324). I would like to make three comments on this first point. When Day speaks of "phenomenological functional relationships" he is mixing the language of two systems; for a phenomenologist not all relations have to be functional relationships in the Skinnerian sense, nor do they have to be so rendered. I would describe it as the problem of the relationship between phenomenological relations and functional relations. Secondly, private events are taken to be examples of phenomenological subject matter. That terminology presupposes the distinction between "private and public," which for the phenomenologist refers to a genuine problem but is poorly described in those terms. The phenomenologist's motivation is to undercut that expression by a more precise distinction which would speak, in general, of the "world in-itself as it appears to me" vs. the "world-in-itself-for-us." This expression overcomes any possible interpretation of events "exclusively-in-me;" all experiences refer to the same World. The question is whether they are given privatively or sharedly, i.e., "for-me" or "for-us." It is only because there is a common world that we can communi cate. Thirdly, when Day (1969, p. 324) speaks of "verbal behavior controlled by observable events" that is an interpretation of language from the viewpoint of radical behaviorism. Phenomenologists would not agree with that kind of expression. Specifi cally we would not speak of language being controlled by observable events. We would be interested, initially, in a careful naive description of the way in which a subject would express the world as it appears in experience. We would then be interested in an analysis of the meanings contained in the naive description, but the bias would be for "meaning categories" rather than categories expressing "control." The second point Day (1969, p. 325) makes is that radical behaviorism is tending to take more seriously the more complex behaviors and phenomena like value, meaning, etc. I can only applaud such a move but F m afraid that we would approach them differently. The most obvious difference would be the categories used by the phenomenologist: the behaviorist would use "control categories" and the phenomenological psychologist would use "meaning categories." Day's (1969, p. 325) third point is that the phenomenologist needs to do a lot more simple description and avoid more theorizing and metaphorizing; then he goes on to critique Rogers as a case in point. Rogers does indeed often wear the phenomenological mantle, but from my perspective he is better at praxis than theorizing, and I agree with Day's specific critique here, but I still disagree with his main point. As noted earlier, phenomenologists are reluctant to theorize and are mainly interested in description precisely in order to avoid premature theorizing. But whether the description is simple or complex depends upon the phenomenon; a complex phenomenon may involve complex descriptions, including metaphors. The point here is that utilization of metaphors may be rigorous; it depends upon the theory of language that is entertained and the type of phenomenon being approached. The fourth point is that the phenomenologist should be wary of the ways in which his own past experience influences his current descriptions or explanations (Day, 1969, p. 325). This is precisely the role that the phenomenological reduction plays and I think that 204</page><page sequence="6">Amedeo Giorgi I have answered this point sufficiently when I disucssed the ideal of presuppositionless ness above. My only question here is, where in the scheme of radical behaviorism is the same concern shown, and how is it implemented? The fifth and last point Day (1969, p. 326) makes in this section is a caution to the phenomenologist that he may be blindly manipulating phenomena that he thinks he is investigating neutrally unless he is aware of the pertinent relations between the environ ment and the role of his own behavior in the situation. All of these problems are acknowledged by the phenomenologist under the question of "constitution." That is, phenomenology is aware that man is responsible for the meanings that he constitutes with respect to the world and it is assumed that he brings with him in every situation a repertoire of past sedimentations of meanings as well as present actively constituting processes, and the question of what role these combined processes play in the current situation is always a key question. Moreover, phenomenologically founded research always assumes a participant researcher in the sense that his role in determining the meaning of the research situation is granted beforehand. Again, the phenomenological reduction is the methodological device used to guard against these possible sources of error. Overall, the issues Day raises in this section are already thematic concerns of the phenomenological psychologist, only they are expressed differently. We are both in terested in relationships of man with the world, be they individual or inter-subjective, simple or complex. We are both interested in description rather than theorizing; both are interested in the active role the researcher plays both in determining the nature of the phenomena he studies, and in understanding them in terms of categories arising from his own past personal experience. With respect to the practical problems involved in making a reconciliation between behaviorism and phenomenology, I can only echo Day's (1969, pp. 326-328) four points. Actually, though, I would make a distinction between the reconciliation between phenomenology and mainstream psychology and phenomenology and radical be haviorism. With the former, my difficulties parallel those of Day: there is only a superficial knowledge of phenomenology; there is a failure to distinguish between naive phenomenology and pure philosophical phenomenology, on the one hand, and radical psychological phenomenology, on the other; there is a lack of training among psychologists in contemporary philosophy; and lastly, the practical problems involved in carrying out explicitly descriptive research hound me everywhere. Theoretically, I can demonstrate that descriptively based research is as solid as any kind of research, but there is a real problem of "face validity" because it does not look like scientific research. With respect to radical behaviorism and phenomenology, we actually agree on all four points. What is needed here is an appreciation of each other's language, aims, approach and praxis. Only dialogue can accomplish that. Now to the third task with respect to Day's article. I shall try to start a dialogue by presenting phenomenological parallels to what Day calls the basic dimensions of radical behaviorism. First, I will make two general remarks. Day outlines four key dimensions to radical behaviorism and each time he uses the term "focal." But to have something as a focus means that it stands out from a ground; for me that means, although I do not know if Day would say it, that there is an implicit structural approach to his radical behaviorism. 205</page><page sequence="7">Phenomenological Psychology and Behaviorism: A Beginning Dialogue Secondly, I cannot let pass without comment that each time he indicates a dimension of radical behaviorism, Day uses a term implying consciousness, like awareness, or interest. I, personally, have no objection to such expressions for I think it is impossible to account for perceptual reality without at least implying structural terms or terms implying consciousness ? or more precisely, language referring to the viewpoint of a subject in a situation. Day's (1969, p. 318) first dimension of radical behaviorism is "a focal interest in the control of behavior." My parallel would be an interest in researching how the meaning of behavior in a situation can be determined. Day's (1969, p. 318) second dimension is: "the focal awareness that any scientist is himself a behaving organism." My parallel would be that the researcher is himself a conscious, experiencing subject living what he is studying. His third dimension is: "focal interest in verbal behavior controlled by directly observed events" (Day, 1969, p. 320). My parallel would be: "the relationship between the specific linguistic expression and all relevant horizonal and contextual factors." Lastly, Day's (1969, p. 321) dimension is: "Focal awareness of the importance of environmental variables" and my parallel is: "The importance of the world for under standing man as a being-in-the-world." In each case, the difference is that I do not specify as narrowly as Day does, nor would I do so in the same manner if I had to. This lack of specification, however, is not from a lack of desire or ability, but rather it flows from differences in presuppositions; my conceptions of man and science are broader than those of radical behaviorism and therefore my statements would reflect those differences. This difference goes right to the heart of the matter and, in my opinion, is ultimately due to the fact that radical behaviorism has, on the one hand, a strong commitment to a certain conception of science, and on the other, a naive self-understanding of description. For the phenomenological psychologist both science and description are viewed criti cally and their meaning cannot be simply assumed. I shall try to elaborate these differences in terms of a concrete example, and in the course of the elaboration I will be able to speak to the question of "mentalism." IV. Science and Description in Radical Behaviorism and Phenomenological Psychology Let us suppose one tries to describe an airplane. Ordinarily any naive person will include characteristics of the plane itself, its metallic color, its shape, its parts (e.g., the fuselage, wings, nose, tail, etc.), responses to the plane and its characteristics (e.g., I don't like its shape, flying is scary, flying is thrilling), as well as some terms that are ambiguous with respect to object characteristics and personal characteristics (e.g., its sleekness, its powerful presence, its fly-ability). In such descriptions, it seems that some terms refer to one kind of reality such as physical reality, which includes the object itself and its characteristics; whereas other terms seem to refer to a different kind of reality ? what in ordinary language are called feelings, opinions, attitudes, etc., or mental reality. I shall omit discussion of the ambiguous terms for the moment. Now, much of traditional psychology simply accepts such a distinction, gives each side its due, separates them, calls them each "reality" and sets up either a cause-effect, or correlational relationship between them. Thus, the relationship between the physical 206</page><page sequence="8">Amedeo Giorgi environment as the physicist conceives it ? such as 700 m /jl ? and the most elementary response of the organism to this stimulus (red) gives us psychophysics. The relationship between the functioning of the nervous system, say occipital area of the brain and the concomitant awareness ? visual perception, gives us psychophysiology. The relation ship between clinical bodily functions and the concomitant experiential responses gives us psychosomatics, and so on. In these instances the presumption is often that one is studying the interaction of two realities. Radical behaviorism, as I understand it, agrees with the descriptions yielding the objective characteristics that we have described, but hesitates to condone descriptions at the other "reality" called "mental" because it is not publicly observable and ma nipulate. More precisely, as I understand it, Skinner (1963b) does not deny that such mental realities exist, nor does he dismiss them as scientifically irrelevant, but claims that they must be transformed into perceptual (observable) or behavioral equivalents in order to be dealt with scientifically. So we arrive at the criteria of radical behaviorism and their origins (see Meyer, 1975). Ascience of behavior demands that whatever reality we are to deal with must be perceptually given to more than one and it must be manipulate. In this, radical behaviorism sets out on a huge task: it tries to translate all mental terms into their perceptual bases or counterparts. In other words, radical behaviorism's argument is that a more exact and careful description would not get carried away and posit all sorts of loose "mental" entities (which may be acceptable in the everyday world) but it would stick to the perceptual and manipulate givens, such as behavior, especially verbal behavior. Moreover, one additional criterion is added. In order that man can be understood totally, one must be able to predict his behavior for given situations, and thus in order to be completely sure, only those aspects of behavior whose dependency on relevant aspects of the environment that can be demonstrated for that situation can be included in a science of behavior. I am not sure that the line of reasoning that I have presented is entirely correct, but in any event, the behaviors of humans and other organisms are conceived to be under the "control" of the environment. Thus, feeling thrilled at seeing a plane would have to be described in terms of the observable behavioral dependencies that the "thrilling behavior" revealed in the presence of a trained other (researcher). The phenomenologist is willing to accept the consequences of radical behaviorism if they are really true. But before he dismisses some part of reality, he wants to be sure that it is indeed useless for a science of human behavior. Let us return to the perception of the airplane. One says that it is thrilling. Is thrilling a state of consciousness within the person? No, ifs a particular, qualified way in which he relates to an object in the world. It is a manner of relating to an object that is at least partially visible to another conscious ness which perceives it. How about the ambiguous term "sleek airplane?" Do I first view a physical form, and then infer the correct category "sleekness?" I am not aware ofthat process. To posit it as unconscious is itself an inference since one does not see "the unconscious" of another. That interpretation brings even more difficulties. No, the perceptual given as described is "a sleek airplane" and sleekiness belongs to the airplane as much as it does to my perceiving it. "Sleek" becomes a subjective quality only for the line of reasoning that says that physical reality is one type, and all other qualities are another type of reality. But that is an assumption, an interpretation and an argument; it is not a description. Everyday descriptions constantly challenge our scientific and 207</page><page sequence="9">Phenomenological Psychology and Behaviorism: A Beginning Dialogue philosophical categories. For phenomenology, perceived sleekiness is also a certain way of relating to an object of the world; it is a way of behaving. But suppose we consider the shape of the wing or its metallic color? Even if there is no additional qualitative tinge, it still requires an awareness, a human or organismic presence that actively apprehends it. Even to perceive the minimum, a spot of metallic color, is a certain way that the object relates to my gaze, it's a certain way of being bodily present to an object in the world. Being thrillingly present to an airplane, and perceiving a spot of metallic color are certainly different ways of being engaged with the world ? but that does not make one real and the other unreal, or one active and the other passive; or one arbitrary and the other precise. They can all be either. These distinctions flow from an approach that bifurcates reality, but it is not without its challenges. Merleau-Ponty (1963, pp. 102-103) writes the following concerning this point: "When one speaks of the structure of the situation and its meaning, these words evidently designate certain givens of human experience and are consequently suspect of anthropomorphism. But 'colors,' 'lights,' and 'pressures' or their expression in physical language are no less so. It is clear that all the terms of which we can make use refer to phenomena of human experience, naive or scientific. . . . [W]e cannot treat reactions to the structure of the situation as derived or give a privilege of objectivity to those which depend on elementary excita tions." Thus, it is not that perceiving a metallic color is "objective" and experiencing the plane as thrilling is "subjective," but both are objective in thematically different ways. Hence, insofar as radical behaviorism attempts to express a "thrilling experience" objectively it is in harmony with phenomenological psychology. However, to the extent that its criteria of "objectivity" are biased by physical and manipulable definitions of reality it diverges from phenomenological psychology. The criteria prevent it from capturing the totality of a present phenomenon, and at times prevent it from being open to the full range of objective phenomena. It is this bias also that makes it dismiss too facilely what mentalism is trying to say. Phenomenology agrees that the "mental" as a substance that interacts with either the body or the world does not exist. But for the phenomenologist, mentalism is a motivated error. It is trying to say something even if it is poorly expressed. Radical behaviorism tries to solve the problem posed by mentalism by translating mentalisms into be haviorisms, which essentially means doing away with whatever it is that mentalism referred to. Phenomenology attempts to recover the referent of mentalism and integrate it in a more adequate expression. Thus, for Merleau-Ponty, for example, the mental is reducible to the structure of behavior ? not to behavior itself ? but to the structure of behavior. This implies that it is a certain way of understanding behavior that is ordered with respect to its situation. Perhaps the key theoretical difference centers on the acceptance of intentionality by phenomenology, on the one hand, and the consistent explicit ignorning of it by radical behaviorism. It seems to me that the essence of radical behaviorism is to account for man strictly in terms of external relations; to make absolutely no reference to man's own viewpoint on the world. I am not sure of the motivation for this insistence, but to me it relates to radical behaviorism's understanding of science. Anyway, for radical be haviorism the relationship between man and world is not really dialectical, for every change in the world brought about by man has to once again be interpreted in terms of the 208</page><page sequence="10">Amedeo Giorgi environmental stimuli which controlled the changing behavior. The relationship among men is not really dialectical either, for one's behavior toward another has to once again be interpreted in terms of the controlling stimuli that the other presented. Thus, man's own orientation to the world is only apparent. Granted that interiority has been poorly conceived in the history of psychology (it's been interpreted as a substance, an internal thing, etc.), but again, was it not at least pointing to something? For phenomenology, man is intrinsically oriented to, related to, the world; he is a viewpoint (not substance) towards the world and this viewpoint is in the world; it is at least partially visible to others. The reason that there is only partial visibility is that there are temporal and spatial horizons, as well as relationships with others, that cannot all be condensed to a moment of time or space; but the threads of all these relationships can be ascertained in any present moment. Hence, when it is stated that radical behaviorism and phenomenological psychology have different conceptions of science guiding them, what is meant is the following. Radical behaviorism has a clear understanding of science and it is not essentially different from how the natural sciences understand themselves (Skinner, 1963a, p. 515). The difficulty is that the everyday world is not "ready-made" for the demands of science (e.g., mentalistic expressions are used in everyday life and they have to be translated into behavioral equivalents; "freedom" is used in everyday life, but one would only have to discover all the determining contingencies, etc.). The phenomenological psychologist notes the same discrepancy between science and everyday phenomena, but noticing that science has developed with a bias towards phenomena of nature, he believes that it is the interpretation of science that has to be changed. It has to be broadened to include human phenomena as well as phenomena of nature. Thus he begins by accepting at face value the naive descriptions of everyday life and then tries to understand them methodically and rigorously, i.e., scientifically. But he feels that he is constituting a broader understanding of science by this process. This then accounts for the differences manifested in this section. The second major difference of this section to be discussed concerns the use and understanding of description. Essentially, radical behaviorism does not speak to the question of a theory or viewpoint on description. It assumes that descriptions simply capture what is there. The whole question of what behavior is, which aspects of it to describe, and what language to use, are problems for phenomenological psychology, however. Thus phenomenology begins with the constitutive role of the describer, i.e., that he in part creates what he describes, and thus it is just as important for him to speak to the context or perspective from which he speaks as it is to describe what is thematically given. When it comes to the content of behavioral descriptions, there seems to be another divergence between radical behaviorism and phenomenology. In other words, precisely what is the perceptual object when one is describing behavior? So far as I can gather, for radical behaviorism behavior is any measurable movement of a body. For phenomenologists, however, because of intentionality, behavior simply cannot be adequately described without reference to the situation from the viewpoint of the behaver. Moreover, phenomenologists generally have a more integrated pre-conception of how behavior presents itself to a perceiving of it. I shall present some excerpts from 209</page><page sequence="11">Phenomenological Psychology and Behaviorism: A Beginning Dialogue Sartre to indicate what some of the presuppositions phenomenology maintains concern ing behavior are. Sartre (1956, p. 344) writes as follows: "The other's body as flesh is immediately given as the center of reference in a situation which is synthetically organized around it, and it is inseparable from this situation. Therefore we should not ask how the other's body can first be a body for me and subsequently enter into a situation. The other is originally given to me as a body in situation. Therefore there's not, e.g., first a body and later action." Further on, Sartre (1956, pp. 345-346) continues: "Pierre's gesture which is revealed to me in the present I always apprehend temporally from the standpoint of the future goals toward which he is reaching. Thus I make known to myself the present of the body by means of its future. . . . We shall never be able to understand anything about the psychological problem of the perception of the other's body if we do not grasp first this essential truth ? that the other's body is perceived wholly differently than other bodies: for in order to perceive it we always move to it from what is outside of it, in space and time; we apprehend its gesture 'against the current' by a sort of inversion of time and space. To perceive the other is to make known to oneself what he is by means of the world." Again Sartre (1956, p. 346) writes: "I never perceive an arm raised alongside a motionless body. I perceive Pierre-who-raises-his-hand. This does not mean that by an act of judgment I relate the movement of the hand to a 'consciousness' which instigated it; rather I can apprehend the movement of the hand or of the arm only as a temporal structure of the whole body. Here it is the whole which determines the order and movement of its parts." Elaborating still further, Sartre (1956, pp. 346-347) continues: "Thus the meanings do not refer to a mysterious psychism; they are this psychism in so far as it is a transcendence-transcended. Of course there is a psychic cryptography; certain phenomena are 'hidden'. But this certainly does not mean that the meanings refer to something 'beyond the body'. They refer to the world and to themselves. In particular these emotional manifestations . . . by no means indicate to us a hidden affection lived by some psychism which would be the immaterial object of the research of the psychologist. These frowns, this redress, this stammering, this slight trembling of the hands, these downcast looks which seem at once timid and threatening ? these do not express anger, they are the anger. But this point must be clearly understood. In itself a clenched fist is nothing and means nothing. But we also never perceive just a clenched fist. We perceive a man who in a certain situation clenches his fist. This meaningful act considered in connection with the past and with possibles and understood in terms of the synthetic totality 'body in situation' is the anger. It refers to nothing other than actions in the world (e.g., to strike, insult, etc.), i.e., to new meaningful attitudes of the body. We cannot get away from the fact that the 'psychologic object' is entirely released to perception and is inconceivable outside corporeal structures." Lastly, Sartre (1956, p. 347) writes: "Thus it is not necessary to resort to habit or reason by analogy in order to explain how we understand expressive conduct. This conduct is originally released to perception as understandable; its meaning is part of its being just as the color of the paper is part of the being of the paper. It is therefore no more 210</page><page sequence="12">Amedeo Giorgi necessary to refer to other conduct in order to understand a particular conduct than to refer to the color of the table, or of another paper or of foliage in order to perceive the color of the folio which is placed before me." I have quoted Sartre at length in order to provide a kind of multi-perspectival presentation of the conceptual presuppositions guiding how phenomenologists perceive behavior in situations. The differences in posture between the phenomenological perspective and that of radical behaviorism should be evident. So far as I can tell a similar elaboration of what description means to radical behaviorists is not available. It is clear that they are interested in both description and formal analysis of behavior, but I have not been able to determine whether one describes behavior first and then formal analysis proceeds, or whether one describes from within a formal frame of reference initially. It is also not clear to me to what extent radical behaviorists are dealing with constructs rather than perceptions. For example Skinner (1963b, p. 955) writes: "In an experimental analysis, the relation between a property of behavior and an operation performed upon the organism is studied directly." But what is meant by a property? Elsewhere Skinner (1966, p. 1205) writes: "The experimental analysis of behavior has emphasized another property. The probability that an organism will behave in a given way is a more valuable datum than the mere fact that it does so behave. Probability may be inferred from frequency of emission." Thus, the probability that a given behavior may appear is more important than the fact of its appearance, and for Skinner, this is an example of "property." I can easily agree with the statement, but the point at issue here is just how this is a "direct" description? It is a description that is not naive and it presupposes one of several possible frames of reference, that is, a type of understanding. In other words, to count frequency of responses is a certain way of understanding the behavior that appears, and thus as Koffka pointed out long ago, the datum is a construction. To what extent then is the description naive, and if it is not meant to be naive, then where is the theory of description that radical behaviorism presupposes? V. Summary This paper is an attempt to initiate a dialogue between phenomenological psychology and radical behaviorism on a basis of "convergence" rather than contrast. After the first contrasting attempts (Wann, 1964; Brody and Oppenheim, 1966) the initial convergent attempt was written by a behaviorist (Day, 1969), and this is, however belated, a response to that article by a phenomenological psychologist, also within a spirit of convergence. No claim is made that radical behaviorism has been correctly understood; only that an attempt was made to understand it sympathetically. Behaviorists should feel free to correct all unintended misrepresentations. The two key differences, from the perspective of the present, seem to revolve around the understanding of science and description that radical behaviorism and phenomenological psychology entertain. Perhaps these differences can be pursued more fully in the near future. 211</page><page sequence="13">Phenomenological Psychology and Behaviorism: A Beginning Dialogue REFERENCES Brody, N. &amp; Oppenheim, P.
