Stanford University Press, Stanford University, Calif. 1949. 78 pages, 8 figs. 10 plates (4 in color). $2.50. This small volume is an unusual blending of keen observation on insect behavior and a skillful biochemical analysis of a remarkable phase of insect metabolism. The latter occupies half of the volume and is devoted to the manner in which this predaceous, and therefore protein-ingesting, organism (Sceliphron cementarium) rids itself of nitrogenous waste. This accumulates during the larval (feeding) stage, to be discharged when the insect emerges as the imago seven or eight months later. Because the larva pos- sesses no anal orifice, no excretory "liver" (Malpighian tubules), the nitrogenous waste is stored as insoluble crystals of uric acid in the "fat body." During metamorphosis a com- plete intestinal canal develops, with accessory glands, and in due course of time the uric acid is changed to soluble allantoin (by experimentally dlemonstrated allantoinase), which is eliminated by the Malpighian tubules and excreted into the intestinal canal. Here the reconverted uric acid is collected into pellets which the wasp eliminates upon emergence from the nest at the rate of a dozen a day for several days. The uric acid may total 1/22 of the insect's weight. How super-gouty, the author remarks, would not a man be who had to eliminate a corresponding quantity (7 lbs.) of uric acid! This biochemical study the author develops logically as a kind of motif in a sketch of the insect's life history, giving the whole work the charm of lucidity and simplicity. Each of the last four chapters is devoted to an individual "friend" or "acquaintance" of the author: "The Muddauber of the Window," ". . . of the Long Box,'". .. of the Shlutters" and "Crumple-wing." The latter was unable to fly, yet performed many of the race's behavioral responses in captivity. Here we have straightforward and honest reports on insect personalities, adaptability, memory and learning. In common with most writers on the habits of solitary wasps the author succumbs to much anthropomorphism and ento- mological mind reading; but one has the impression that he does this mainly for literary flavor. Certainly the behaviorist can read this work with profit, for the actual observations are clearly stated. In these studies retired professors have an example set in the very evident pleasure which Professor Emeritus Shafer had in making his observations and experiments and in telling us about them.-CARL G.
