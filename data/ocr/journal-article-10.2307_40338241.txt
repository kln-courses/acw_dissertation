Byrne* Abstract: This article shows how Bernard Lonergan s philosophy of science can bring resolution to a recent controversy: the controversy that arises from Intelligent Design theorists' and proponents of neo-Darwinian evolution. Intelligent Design theories argue that the complex structures of living organisms cannot be adequately explained by neo-Darwinian theories, especially by its postulate of random variations. Hence, an "intelligent designer" must be postulated in order to fill out scientific explanations. This article finds fault with the Intelligent Design arguments, but proposes a different form of design argument - one that accepts neo-Darwinian evolution (or something very much like it). It shows how Lonergan s analysis of scientific methods grounds his account of evolution, and how much this can overcome the most basic Intelligent Design objections. It then shows how Lonergan s philosophy of God also can offer a design argument based, not in the complexity of this or that organism, but in the "design" of evolution itself.

The tension has been there from the first stirrings of evolutionary thought. To a fundamen- talist, for example, the millions of years stipulated in evolutionary theories pose an outright contradiction to a literal reading of the Genesis creation narratives. Problems persist even for non-fundamentalists of a more philo- sophical bent of mind - namely those who find it difficult to reconcile a con- cept of divine design or purpose (a central tenet of Christianity) with the reliance on randomness in neo-Darwinian accounts of evolution. In this article I hope to develop a position that can be stated simply, but not as easily explained. My thesis is that there is a kind of argument from design that is compatible with neo-Darwinian evolution (or something very much like it). Most discussions of this topic hold that either intelligent design is true, or that neo-Darwinism is true, but not both. Most of the attention in this debate has been captured by those who take one extreme position or the other. Either intelligent design or neo-Darwinian evolution, but certainly not both. But I contend that this need not be an either/or. Rather, I will argue that the affirmation of evolution and belief in a divine, intelligent designer are compatible. My claim about this compatibility is of course not entirely unique. Michael Ruse for one has written a great deal about how Darwinism and Christian Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia H^l D DF ["""" ~ 63-2007 l^glW D DF I 86</page><page sequence="3">Lonergan, Evolutionary Science, and Intelligent Design 895 belief in God as creator need not be in conflict with one another.1 Several others have also stated quite emphatically that they consider neo-Darwinism and religious faith to be compatible.2 While I am in fundamental agreement with these claims, I will go a bit beyond merely claiming that there is no con- flict between Darwinism and faith. I will explore how this can be true - how it is possible to hold both to be true. I will further suggest that, after showing how this could be possible, one can go even further and develop a philosophi- cal argument for the existence of a divine designer. Showing how this can be so is complicated. The complications arise from the fact that there are several ways of construing neo-Darwinian evolution, and there are many ways of conceiving of an intelligent, purposeful divine creator. In fact most of these ways of conceiving evolution and of conceiving God are indeed incompatible with one another. In my attempt to find an acceptable way to approach this question of compatibility, I am relying on the work of philosopher and theologian Bernard Lonergan. His philosophical approach to evolution and to the question of divine design has several advan- tages. Before turning to his approach, however, I will begin by briefly summa- rizing some of the prominent objections that have been raised by intelligent design proponents against neo-Darwinism, and vice-versa. Standard Intelligent Design Arguments Arguments from design and criticisms of them arose very early in the history of western philosophy. However in 1802 Anglican Archdeacon William Paley put forth the form of the design argument that has become paradig- matic for the debates between religion and Darwinian evolutionary theory. Paley began with a famous analogy: If a watch were found lying in a field, one would appropriately infer that it was designed by a designer.3 Each of its parts was designed for a purpose in the overall functioning of the watch, which itself has the purpose of aiding human beings in telling time. Likewise, Paley argued, the intricacies of biological organisms occurring in nature also point to a designer. Beginning with the structure of the eye, he explored the inter- connections among parts of many organisms, arguing that these complexities and their fitness for their functions are evidences of a divine designer. Charles Darwin himself was initially drawn to the argument from design set forth by 1 For example Michael Ruse - Can a Darwinian Be a Christian?

Byrne Paley, but his observations and probing reflections eventually led him to aban- don that position.4 Paley s arguments are no longer widely accepted, but more sophisticated versions have since appeared. One such version has been set forth recently by professor of biochemistry Michael Behe. He describes in careful detail several complex biochemical pathways and structures that play crucial roles in organic functioning. One of his most impressive examples concerns blood clotting.5 More than 20 distinct and intricately related biochemical reactions are needed to initiate (and bring to a halt) this protective response to a wound. Behe argues that this whole sequence of reactions is "irreducibly complex." That is to say, a biochemical sequence is irreducibly complex if the removal of even one of the chemical reactions would lead to the collapse of the entire sequence. For this reason, he argues, these irreducibly complex sequences must emerge entirely whole - all or nothing. This means, he continues, that the irreducibly complex sequences could not have evolved piece by piece through normal evolutionary processes of random variation and natural selection. Therefore they must have been produced by an intelligent designer who intervened at some time to place them in the universe.6 Behe deliberately refrains from calling this designer God, but, if his argument were valid, such a conclusion would immediately follow. Another sophisticated version of the design argument has been advanced by William Dembski. Dembski approaches the issue not as a biochemist but as a mathematician, computer scientist, and information theorist. He approaches the question of evolution and design from the perspective of "specified com- plexity" (rather than "irreducible complexity"). He borrowed the term from authors such as physicist Paul Davies, who wrote: "Living organisms are mysterious not only for their complexity per se, but for their tightly specified complexity."7 Living organisms are sharply contrasted with inorganic crystals, which are complex but lack this sort of specified complexity. The idea of specified complexity comes from the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, which was given a vivid dramatization in the 1997 movie Contact. In that movie radio signals from outer space appeared as a long string of numbers on a computer screen. At first this appeared to be an entirely random 4 Dov Ospovot - The Development of Darwin's Theory: Natural History, Natural Theology and Natural Selection 1839-1859.

In mathematical terms, how would an investigator know whether or not such a series of numbers arose randomly, rather than from some intelligent source? Dembski attempts to answer this question by developing the notion of "specification" - or, we might say, "independent specification" or "pre-speci- fication." In other words, if it is possible to arrive at the pattern found in the sequence independently of and prior to actually encountering the sequence of numbers or events, then this means that its pattern could have been designed. If, on the other hand, the only way to arrive at the sequence of numbers or events is by waiting for them to unfold in time, then the sequence cannot be said to have a designed pattern. Dembski further argues that the degree of specified complexity of the design depends upon how many "resources" one must use in pre-specifying the pattern, and uses this to determine the prob- ability of such a pattern.8 Dembski calculates the total number of possible events that could have occurred during the lifetime of the universe (approxi- mately 10150 events). He next argues that any "specified complexity" that has a probability of less than 10~150 cannot have arisen merely by chance and must, therefore, have originated from an intelligent designer. He further argues that certain organic structures (such as those treated by Behe) have a level of specified complexity too high to originate merely by chance. He concludes that since neo-Darwinism is committed to random variations, it cannot be the sole, adequate explanation for organic structures of such specified complexity. Hence there must be an intelligent designer. Behe, Dembski and other proponents of such design arguments have come in for much criticism. A fatal flaw in my view has to do with the logical struc- ture of their arguments. Behe, for example, assumes that the many intricate steps in the irreducibly complex sequences either would have to appear ran- domly all at once, or that they would have to be introduced one after another over many generations. But the first alternative is an untenable scenario because of its vanishing probability, while the second is excluded because irreducibly complex sequences cannot stabilize until all the steps are in place. However, these are not the only two alternatives. As molecular and cell biolo- gist Kenneth Miller has argued, Behe s irreducibly complex cycles could have arisen through a series of modifications to less complex sequences.9 Originally the less complex sequences could have had different biological functions that shifted to novel functions as a result of the successive modifications. Although neither Miller nor anyone else has stood watch for the thousands or millions 8 Ibid, p. 317. 9 Kenneth R. Miller - Finding Darwin's God. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1999, pp. 130-64.

Byrne of years that would be required to actually observe the entire series of such transformations, his proposals undermine the logic of Behes design argu- ments. Behe s arguments depend on the claim that the organic structures and sequences could not possibly have been produced by any random sequence of natural causes, so the intervention of a designer is needed to explain its exis- tence. Miller and others have shown that there are indeed alternative possibil- ities (and indeed possibilities supported by considerable empirical evidence), so the logic of these design arguments fails. These criticisms are similar to those leveled against the classic "God of the gaps" arguments for God's exis- tence. But where the God of the gaps arguments fail once actual explanations are found for unexplained phenomena, these new design arguments fail once possibilities and probabilities are presented. By way of contrast, Lonergans approach to the question of evolution and design begins by asking different kinds of questions than those pursued by standard forms of the design argument. While the standard arguments attempt to show that this or that particular structure in the natural world can only be explained by postulating the intervention of a divine designer, Lonergan shifts the focus by asking whether the entirety of the evolving world itself has an explanation. This, I believe, is a more fruitful path toward a valid argument from design. In what follows, I will trace Lonergans approach. First, I will offer an all too brief summary of his account of scientific methods as heuristic. Then I will explain how he moved from his account of scientific methods to what can be said about the structure of the universe that is to be known by using such methods. Finally I will explain how he approached the question of the designer of such a universe. Lonergan on Scientific Methods (1) Lonergan and Darwin, Lonergans book Insight covers an impressive range of topics. Its point of departure is an extended reflection on modern science, culminating in his own philosophical account of evolution. His account shares many important features with that of Charles Darwin, and Lonergan bestows upon Darwin some of the highest praise in the entire book.10 Among other things, Lonergan is quite emphatic that new biological species and their emergent structures can and do arise through natural processes that involve genuine randomness. Nevertheless, he does differ from Darwin in certain ways. 10 Bernard Lonergan - Insight: A Study of Human Understanding. Collected Works of Bernard Lonergan, vol. 3, edited by Frederick E.

Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Tltffl «- - 63.2007 118RPF I 90</page><page sequence="7">Lonergan, Evolutionary Science, and Intelligent Design 899 First and foremost among Lonergans ways of differing from Darwin is the basis for his account of evolution. Darwin developed his argument on the basis of his extensive observations and readings about biological, geological and human populational phenomena. The neo-Darwinian synthesis was craft- ed at the beginning of the twentieth century when Mendelian genetics was rediscovered and incorporated into classical Darwinian explanations. While Lonergan was well-informed about the natural phenomena and neo-Darwinian explanations, his own observations focused primarily on how scientists do science, rather than on evolutionary data from the natural world and expla- nations of them that scientists' proposed. In other words, Lonergan focused more on scientific methods and practices, rather than on the data and results of scientific method. He developed his evolutionary account from his reflec- tions about the implications of scientific methods. One of the big advantages of this approach is that it is independent of the actual, present state of evolutionary science. The standard intelligent design arguments focus upon complex structures that current science has not yet definitively explained by means of neo-Darwinian mechanisms. By focusing instead on the methods of science, Lonergans approach avoids the God-of- the-gaps problem. His approach does not need to assume that there will be explanatory gaps within the course of natural history; he can assume that all organic structures will be found to have come about through random muta- tions and natural processes of differential survival and inheritance. Lonergans approach does not even have to assume that the present state of neo-Darwinian science is the last word on the matter; it can allow that scientific methods will lead to great alterations in the understanding of evolutionary processes. His approach builds its case for an intelligent designer on the basis of the general evolutionary structure of the universe as it will eventually be known by relent- less use of the scientific methods. Lonergans approach also differs from neo-Darwinism in a second way. He does not limit himself to the field of biological evolution. His interest is in the entirety of the evolving universe, in which the evolution of organic life is a relatively small and recent episode. Hence he develops a more general account of evolution than the specialized version of neo-Darwinism. This was another major reason for attending to scientific methods in general, and not only to the specific methods of neo-Darwinism. (2) Inquiry as Fundamental. While observations, hypotheses, theories, and laws have important roles in modern scientific methods, much more funda- mental than any of these is inquiry, questioning, wonder. As Lonergan puts it, "There is, then, common to all human beings the very spirit of inquiry that constitutes the scientific attitude." n The most basic thing that scientists do is 11 Insight, 197. __ ^^ Revista Portuguese de Filosofia [~ ~"~" 91 ! UlRPF 63.2007 893-918</page><page sequence="8">900 Patrick H. Byrne to inquire and to pursue insights and hypotheses that are possible answers to those inquiries. Moreover, they seek observations not as ends in themselves, but as clues that help them answer their inquiries. Inquiry plays the leading role in scientific methods. A scientist is a person on a mission, and the mis- sion is driven by her or his relentless, inquiring spirit. Of all the acts of human conscious intentionality, then, inquiry is the most fundamental in Lonergan s view. All other acts are responses to inquiry. Inquiry seeks answers - direct and reflective insights, judgments, and deci- sions. Inquiry desires answers, and thereby establishes norms that the answers must meet. Until the desire of inquiry is satisfied, it does not go away. It may be stifled or ignored, but the desire of inquiry persists until it is satisfactorily answered. As Aristotle put it, "when we have discovered that the sun does suffer eclipse, we cease inquiring" about it.12 More generally, our inquiries persist until genuine answers are reached. Inquiries are more basic even than questions - where by "question" I mean the linguistic expression of an inquiry. As Lonergan put it, "Prior to the neatly formulated questions of systematizing intelligence, there is the deep-set wonder in which all questions have their source and ground." 13 An inquiry can be formulated in terms that uncritically introduce assumptions at odds with the orientation of the inquiry itself. Thus, for example, the Pythagoreans formulated the question of the ratio between the side and the diagonal of the square. In doing so they implicitly presumed that the answer would have the form of the ratio of two whole numbers. Subsequent developments revealed that the inquiry could be satisfactorily met only by radically revising the formulation of the question - indeed, the very idea of ratio itself.14 It is for this reason that Lonergan regarded inquiry as the basis for all human knowing, and especially scientific knowing. (3) Science and Explanatory Relations, Lonergan took the strong position that inquiry and insight are fundamental in the many and diverse forms of human knowing - not only in scientific knowing, but also in forms of knowing devoted to commonsense technical practicality, interpersonal relations, self- knowledge, aesthetics, religion, scholarship, and historical research. Still, what distinguishes scientific knowing from other legitimate forms of human knowing is its methodical pursuit of "understanding how things are related to one another." 15 12 Aristotle - Posterior Analytics , I.I 89b27-28. 13 Insight, p. 208. 14 See Patrick H. Byrne - Analysis and Science in Aristotle. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1997, pp. 137-42. 15 Insight, p. 316.

In phenomenology, for example, the descriptive approach has been preferred over the explanatory approach because it preserves and attends to the richness of actual experiences. This is opposed to an explanatory approach, which devalues the richness of experiences, "explaining them away" as the mere products of natural forces and particles, or replacing them with an abstract formalism. Lonergan however means something quite different in his contrast between description and explanation. While a commonsense descriptive approach indeed adheres to a certain richness of experience, Lonergan contends that the explanatory approach is richer still. The commonsense descriptive approach endeavors to understand things in their relations to our senses and our inter- ests. By way of contrast, the explanatory approach endeavors to understand things in all their relations to one another, not merely in relation to human interests and the concerns of common sense. A person confined to the realm of common sense, for example, will have no interest in understanding why iguanas from a given Galapagos Island are unable to interbreed with iguanas from a different island, even though they look very similar to one another. By way of contrast, this question is part of the explanatory horizon s of con- cern for understanding all relations of things to one another. A thorough dedi- cation to an explanatory approach as Lonergan conceives it includes but goes beyond the descriptive approach - it includes questions about how things are related to human commonsense interests, for these are after all part of the totality of relations of things to one another. But the explanatory approach is also concerned to supplement commonsense understanding with the further understanding relationships that are of no interest to commonsense description. To drive this point home, Lonergan coined the phrase "enriching abstraction",17 and remarked about the explanatory approach: In the trained observer, outer sense forgets its primitive biological functions to take on a selective alertness that keeps pace with the refinements of elaborate and subtle classifications. In the theorist, intent upon a problem, even the subconscious goes to work to yield at unexpected moments the suggestive images of clues and missing links, of patterns and perspectives, that evoke the desiderated insight and the delighted cry, 'Eureka!'"18 16 Insight, p. 201. 17 Insight, p. 112. 18 Insight, p. 209. n Hfffii Revista Portuguese de Filosofia 93 I UamPF 63.2007 893-918</page><page sequence="10">902 Patrick H. Byrne In other words, in Lonergans account, scientific knowing neither invali- dates nor replaces common sense or any other form of knowing. Rather, the scientific approach both expands the field of experiences and also seeks to understand a wider universe of relationships. For Lonergan, the explanatory approach forms the heart of the authentic meaning of the scientific attitude. Science is about discovering (unveiling) of the rich diversity of relationships that constitute the universe. Clearly science and explanation in this sense does not violate, but rather fulfills the phenomenological spirit. (4) Self-Correction and Verification. Merely having an insight, scientific or otherwise, doesn't automatically mean that it is a correct insight. Insights arise from questions about experiences. But then these insights themselves also give rise to further questions about their own correctness. These further questions stimulate a self-correcting, cyclical process that heads toward veri- fied knowledge in the fullest sense. Verification is no mere process showing that theoretical predictions are borne out by experimental data. This naive version of verification has been roundly criticized by twentieth century philosophers of science.19 For Lonergan it is inquiry, not sense data as such, that holds the key to verification, for inquiry dictates which observations are to be sought and how they are to be regarded. Even experiments that fail to verify an explanatory insight are also important moments in scientific investigation. They give rise to still further inquiries and insights in an ongoing, self-correcting process that is at the heart of the scientific method. Verification is less a matter of "matching" hypotheses to data than of answering all the further pertinent inquiries. The scientist can reasonably affirm that her or his understanding of explanatory relations is correct only when these further inquiries are fully answered. (5) Intelligibility of the World. Scientific method is fundamentally a matter of inquiry seeking insights into the intelligibility of the natural world. Sponta- neously scientists act as though the world is intelligible and that their efforts to understand it will pay off. As Albert Einstein once said, "The most incom- prehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible." Nevertheless, there is a pervasive assumption by many proponents and opponents alike that evolutionary science is purely materialistic. Most authors, pro and con, speak of Darwinian evolution and its explanatory power under the heading of a "material" science or "material" laws or principles or mecha- nisms. This is not only true of those who claim that Darwinism eliminates the validity of theistic belief. Even believers like Miller speak of Darwinian evolution as materialistic: "the biological world of today... is one that works 19 See Frederick Suppe - "The Search for Philosophical Understanding of Scientific Theories."

Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia riffl f ™" 63-2007 UhRPF I 94</page><page sequence="11">Lonergan, Evolutionary Science, and Intelligent Design 903 according to purely material rules."20 If one assumes that evolutionary science is purely materialistic, this poses considerable difficulties for thinking about how God, a purely spiritual being, can have any relationship with the world investigated by scientific methods. Lonergan s approach of grounding scientific method in inquiry and insight shifts the focus rather dramatically. Modern science is a search for correct insights into the intelligibility of the natural world. Explanation comes from understanding the intelligible relationships that constitute nature, not from the brute materiality of nature. Modern science seeks the intelligibilities that explain why things happen as they do. Brute matter does not explain anything at all, and it especially does not yield scientific explanations. According to Lonergan, materialism is just another example of "extra-scientific opinion,"21 an extra, metaphysical assumption added over and above the intelligibilities that scientific methods discover and seek to verify. (6) Science as Heuristic. Lonergan argued that scientific method is "heu- ristic" - meaning that inquiries anticipate certain types of answers, and that scientists use these anticipations methodically guide them as they seek answers. While acknowledging the many varieties and great differences among the methods employed in different branches of science and individual scientists, Lonergan proposed that there are two basic kinds of heuristic pursuits or methods commonly used by all natural sciences, and a third kind employed specifically in the biological sciences. All natural sciences, he argued, employ what he called classical and statistical methods.22 In the biological sciences, it is necessary to add a third kind of method, a genetic method that seeks correct understanding of development from a single, undifferentiated fertil- ized cell into a highly complex and differentiated multicellular organism.23 (7) Classical Heuristic Method and Conditioned Correlations. As with many philosophers and historians of science, Lonergan credited Galileo as the first to develop modern scientific method. In particular, he regarded Galileo s intro- ducetion of techniques of measurement and geometrical proportions as his greatest contributions to scientific method. Subsequent generations of scien- tists amplified and generalized and adapted this aspect of Galileo s science in many different areas in pursuit of the overall question: how are things related to one another? 20 Miller - op.cit., p. 217. He continues: "God can carry out the work He chooses to in a way that is consistent with the fully jnaterialistic view of biology." For Lonergan a fully intelligible view of biology is needed. 21 Insight, p. 424. 22 Insight, pp. 60-88. 23 Insight, pp. 484-492. Even though genetic method is crucial to biological and evolutionary science, it is not possible to summarize Lonergans long discussion in this article. However, its inclusion would not alter the general features of the argument that follows. - -i r^j Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia j 95 I UalRPF 63*2007 1893-918</page><page sequence="12">904 Patrick H. Byrne The first kind of heuristic, scientific method - which Lonergan dubbed "classical heuristic method" - pursues insights into the intelligible correla- tions among events and things. In physics, these correlations are expressed in equations that relate variables to one another. These relationships play so fundamental a role in modern science that we emphasize their role by use of a juridical metaphor - "law" of science. For example, in physics we speak of Galileos "law" of natural acceleration, Newtons "law" of gravitation, the "laws" of conservation of energy and momentum, and the gas "laws." In chem- istry there are similar correlations, such as the "law" of balancing oxidation and reduction states in chemical reactions. Again, in biology, Georges Cuvier began the modern scientific study of comparative anatomy with his "law of the correlation of parts," while Darwin is credited with the "law" of natural selection. But the metaphor of law can lead to what Lonergan called an "oversight of insight."24 That is to say, it is easy to overlook a most important feature of the equations and other correlations that are discovered by classical methods, namely: these correlations are highly conditioned. Classical correlations are extremely generic, and manifest themselves quite differently, depending upon the environmental conditions. The classic example is Newtons "laws." The very same "laws" manifest themselves in very different and indeed incompat- ible ways under different conditions. Depending upon the relative energies, momenta, and positions of just two celestial bodies, their orbital paths could be hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptical, or circular. If a third or even more bodies are added, even more complex orbits are possible. Contrary to the connota- tion of "law" as an unconditional imperative, Newtons "laws" alone do not determine the paths; actual paths depend upon the specification of conditions outside of Newtons system of "laws." Likewise, the "laws" of relationships among chemical elements lead to very different kinds of chemical reactions, depending upon the different conditions of temperature, concentration, pH level, and so on. There is for example no chemical "law" that dictates unconditionally that hydrogen and oxygen must combine to form water molecules, no matter what. That combination happens only under the proper conditions. This is why it is very misleading to speak of the "laws" of nature or "laws" of science. The juridical metaphor of law suggests unconditional control over behavior of natural bodies - natural "laws" replace the image of God as a supreme even dictatorial ruler. To the contrary, the so-called "laws" by them- selves do not completely control or determine events. Their role in determining events is conditioned by conditions that are outside of their control. As will be made clear in what follow, this fact is crucial to a proper characterization of 24 Insight, p. 70.

It is likewise crucial to the debate about the compatibility of religious faith in a Creator God with science in general and with evolutionary science in particular. (8) Emergence of Organized Complexity. Lonergan uses the general features of classical correlations to show how scientists approach the explanation of organized complexity. In doing so, he focuses upon events and processes rather than structures. Consider for example one of the processes so fundamental to almost every form of life on earth - the adenosine triphosphate (atp) cycle of using and replenishing energy. This cycle involves the sequential combination of several different chemical reactions (events). Each reaction constitutes one (but not all) of the key conditions for the occurrence of the next event in the atp cycle. Lonergan called such cycles "schemes of recurrence."25 Specifically, under conditions provided in a cellular mitochondrion for example, when one event in the atp cycle occurs, the next event occurs in accord with some classical "law." Cycles like this one, and even more complex cycles, are pos- sible precisely because there are so many different ways of connecting chemi- cal reactions into sequences. This wide variation of combinations is possible precisely because classical correlations are highly conditioned, and can have many different manifestations under different conditions. Lonergan s analysis of schemes of recurrence is not restricted to biochem- ical phenomena. Repetitive cycles occur in cosmic phenomena such as the fusion cycles inside stars as well as the hydrological* cycles on earth. Each and every transition in these cycles is in accord with and explained by a con- ditioned classical correlation (or "law") discovered through use of classical methods by physicists, chemists, biologists and so on. Lonergan noted further that all throughout the universe, simpler cycles provide the conditions for the recurrence of ever more complex cycles. For instance, the earths supply of light and heat energy is conditioned by the fusion cycles in the interior of our sun. Hence the solar fusion cycles form conditions for the terrestrial hydrological cycles (evaporation, cloud forma- tion, precipitation, water flow, evaporation, etc.). The hydrological cycles dis- tribute and replenish water supplies that form the conditions for the cycles of growth, reproduction, and evolution of plants. Plant cycles in turn constantly replenish supplies of carbohydrates consumed by herbivorous animals. The consumed carbohydrates are broken down and provide the conditions for Krebs cycles in the interiors of animal cells, and the Krebs cycles provide the conditions for the recurrence of atp cycles. There is then a long, complex network or series of conditioned schemes of recurrence reaching from the interior of the sun to the interior of animals' cellular functioning. 25 Insight, p. 141. - 1 pj^j Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia I 97 I UiRPF pj^j 63.2007 1893-918</page><page sequence="14">906 Patrick H. Byrne One of Lonergan s most ingenious observations was that these networks of functional interdependence imply sequences of emergence. The simpler cycles can begin to function without the presence of the more complex cycles. They then set conditions for the emergence of more complex cycles, and this possibility can recur over and again. When it does there is a "conditioned series of schemes of recurrence." These conditioned series of emergent cycles is the key idea in Lonergan s way of speaking of the intelligibility of the whole- ness of evolution. Notice, this idea is not based upon any specific results of scientific investigations, but rather upon the very general features of classical correlations arrived at through the employment of classical heuristic methods. The neo-Darwinian mechanisms of genetic mutation, expression, and selection are specialized instances of this general evolutionary pattern of a conditioned series of schemes of recurrence. Cellular functioning is itself a complex, interdependent set of cycles. If the conditions are right, a genetic mutation alters the cycles of dna expression, rna production and protein synthesis interior to those cells. The newly synthesized protein enzymes alter the previously functioning cycles. If the conditions for their recurrence and reproduction are favorable, they continue and propagate. When they do so, they will also alter the conditions in their environments and provide condi- tions for the emergence of still further cycles. Extremely complex biological structures and pathways can and do emerge gradually, not all at once as Behe claims they must. Lonergans account of conditioned series of schemes of recurrence generalizes Millers rejoinder to Behe - for not only biological but also physical and chemical cycles could have emerged from successive modi- fications of less complex cycles having different functions. (9) Randomness and Statistical Heuristic Method. In addition to providing a general response to Behe s objection, Lonergan s notion of a conditioned series of schemes of recurrence also holds the key to a response to Dembski s objection as well. In order to show this, it is necessary to look briefly at how Lonergan characterized the second form of scientific method, the statistical heuristic method. The idea of a conditioned series of schemes of recurrence provokes the question: Is the whole universe therefore just one big complex cycle, one big deterministic, totalizing system? Lonergans answer is, No. He argues instead that the universe has a vast, non-systematic, random dimension to it. Cycles of complexity occur under proper conditions, but the classical "laws" have to wait for proper conditions to arise, so to speak, and then they will function as they must under those conditions. In general, these sets of conditions arise and fall away in random, non-systematic fashions.26 26 Insight, 131; see also, pp. 109ff and 149-150.

Statistical methods seek to understand populations of events and things. They do this by classify- ing, sampling, and counting. Counting establishes the actual frequencies of a class of things or events in a place and time. But the determination of actual frequencies is not an end in itself. Statistical method goes beyond determining actual frequencies, and seeks to discover ideal relative frequencies, which are called probabilities. The actual frequencies of events will fluctuate randomly around the ideal frequencies (probabilities). In fact, it is possible to discover and verify probabilities precisely because actual frequencies of events fluctu- ate only randomly with respect to those actual frequencies. It is important to examine closely the meaning of randomness, a notion that has become so central and so pervasive in modern science. Randomness is especially central to the neo-Darwinian synthesis. Yet randomness has proved notoriously difficult to define, and it is often badly misunderstood. Physicist Stephen Barr makes exactly this point: In common speech, "random" is often used to mean "uncaused," "meaningless," "inex- plicable," or "pointless." And there is no question that some biologists, when they explain evolution to the public or to hapless students, do argue from the "randomness" of genetic mutations to the philosophical conclusion that the history of life is "unguided" and "unplanned." Some do this because of an anti-religious animus, while others are simply careless... [But the] word "random" as used in science does not mean uncaused, unplanned, or inexplicable. It means uncorrelated.21 Even Dembski assumes that natural processes have some degree of ran- domness to them, and that randomness is a relative concept.28 Lonergan also relied upon this notion of relative randomness when he developed his account of evolution. For him "a situation is random if it is any whatever provided specified conditions of intelligibility are not fulfilled."29 In other words, ran- domness is defined not absolutely, but in relation to some "specified condi- tions of intelligibility." Hence, there isn't just one kind of randomness; there are many. There are as many kinds of randomness as there are kinds of patterned expectations from which actual events can diverge. Randomness is always relative to some sort of pattern (say the curve on a graph). For example, Hubbies "law" in astrophysics is graphed as a simple straight line that relates the distance of a 27 Stephen Barr - "The Design of Evolution." In: First Things. 156 (October 2005), p. 10, emphasis added. 28 Dembski - op. cit., p. 312. 29 Insight, p. 74. This definition can be shown to be a more general version of the definition of randomness widely accepted in the field of information theory. See by Gregory J. Chaitin - "Randomness in Arithmetic." In: Scientific American. 259, n. 1 (July 1988), pp. 80-85. -. __ Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia f~ 99 I UaRPF 63.2007 1893-918</page><page sequence="16">908 Patrick H. Byrne galaxy to its velocity of recession away from the earth. But actual observations of the distances and velocities of galaxies scatter around that straight line.30 Now those data points could conceivably conform to some other pattern - they could, for example oscillate around the straight line in a regular sinusoidal fashion.31 They would then be random relative to the straight line, but not random relative to a more complex kind of pattern that includes simple sine waves. However, it is fairly easy to show that the actual data on galactic reces- sion do not conform even to this somewhat more complicated pattern. Karl Popper has argued that it is impossible to establish by empirical means alone that a given series of events is absolutely random and conforms to no possible intelligible pattern whatsoever.32 The most that can be established is that events are random relative to some specifiable (albeit extremely complex) kinds of patterns. To claim that some series of events is absolutely random goes beyond scientific verifiability (or as Popper would have it, beyond falsifi- ability). Such a claim would turn a relative into an absolute without scientific warrant. The kind of randomness that is relevant to neo-Darwinian theories of evolution has to do with the emergence of biologically advantageous character- istics in their immediate environment. A central tenet of Darwinism is that the biological opportunities, of an environment do not directly cause inheritance of advantageous characteristics. In other words, the origination of heritable genetic variations is random relative to their adaptive advantage in the imme- diate environment.33 If a relatively random series of mutations coincidentally happens to have adaptive advantage in the environment, then it will shift probabilities of survival and propagation of its possessors and their progeny. But this series of mutations is a kind of happy accident. It is not directly caused by the adaptive opportunities available in the immediate environment. There is no direct correlation between the adaptive potentialities of the envi- ronment and the series of mutations that are favored by those potentialities. Specifically, Darwinian explanations have long denied that an organism can pass along to its progeny a characteristic acquired by its own activity in response to the demands of its environment. For example, a snake cannot stimulate and pass along new genes for digestion by swallowing grass that is plentiful in its environment. In addition, neo-Darwinian explanations deny that there is any sort of "emanation" from environmental niches that 30 For a graph of the law with the scattering of observed data points see, http://astrosun2. astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses//astro201/hubbles_law.htm, accessed 1 1/12/06. 31 E.g.,V=HoD + HssinD. 32 Karl R. Popper - The Logic of Scientific Discovery.

Hence, neo-Darwinian explanations would not expect to find some chemical given off by grass that directly pro- duces an adaptive effect upon the genes related to snakes' digestion. Technically speaking, then, this is the type of randomness that is required by neo-Darwinian explanations: randomness of the series of inheritable muta- tions relative to adaptive potentialities in the immediate environment. It is a quite specific and relatively limited assertion of randomness. But to claim that genetic variations are absolutely random relative to every possible intel- ligibility is neither needed by neo-Darwinian science nor could it be verified on purely empirical grounds. Still, there is an even more sweeping type of randomness than that required by neo-Darwinism - a degree of randomness far beyond the limited biological realm, a randomness that in the view of most scientists plays a fundamentally constitutive role in our universe at large. Yet, even this more sweeping sense of randomness is still not absolute randomness - that is, it is not a denial of every sort of intelligibility whatsoever. In order to bring this more sweeping sense of randomness into focus, consider the entire set of all the physical, chemical, and biological events that led up to the totality of all of todays organisms. This totality includes all of the sequences of genetic mutations that ever occurred. It also includes all of the background events and cycles that led to each of these genetic mutations themselves - radiation events, chemical toxins, pH imbalances, chromosomal breakages and cross-overs, and gene transpositions, etc., and all of the prior events that conditioned these events as well. This totality also includes all of the anatomical and physiological varia- tions that resulted from the genetic mutations in the organisms that actually reached maturity. In addition, it includes all the premature deaths of other organisms containing these mutations. It includes as well all the events that brought organisms together at particular places and times resulting in success- ful mating and reproduction. It likewise includes all the events that prevented successful reproduction and propagation of the genetic innovations and phylogenic variations, including the elimination of genetic strains through extinctions. Just as importantly, it includes all the terrestrial and cosmic events, all the fusion cycles of the earliest stars, their nova explosions, the resultant formations of heavier elements, and the re-emergences of more mature stars and planetary systems. It includes all the emergences on the earth of the com- plex physical and chemical cycles that preceded the emergence of life cycles. This is the whole course of the evolution of the universe and living nature as it actually has occurred. This is a radically contingent course of evolution, since after all, many other courses of evolution are also possible and equally compatible with the "laws" of physics, chemistry, and biology, including neo- Darwinian principles. __ ^^ Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia r- -- 101 I UilRPF 63-2007 1893-918</page><page sequence="18">910 Patrick H. Byrne Each actual event and cycle in this vast array of physical, chemical, and biological transitions is intelligibly connected to others by the correlations of physics, chemistry, and biology. But from the point of view of those sciences alone, this entire array is random. That is to say, while each and every event and cycle in the whole course of evolution is completely explainable in terms of some combination of the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology, they are so only in terms of the prior conditions randomly brought together at partic- ular places and times. The correlations of the sciences determine what would happen if those conditions were given, but they do not dictate which condi- tions must be given. It is as if the actual course of evolution were arbitrarily picked out of a "grab bag" of all the possible alternative sequences of events and cycles that are compatible with the correlations of physics, chemistry, and biology. Hence the entire set of events comprised by the entirety of evolu- tion is random relative to the combined resources of physics, chemistry, and biology. This is indeed a very sweeping notion of randomness. Though it is a breath- takingly encompassing conception of randomness, still it is not absolute randomness. This conception of randomness only involves the denial that the actual course of the evolution of our universe can be completely determined, conditions and all, by means of the possible combinations of the correlations of physics, chemistry, and biology alone. This conception of randomness does not imply the denial of every possible intelligibility, for such a denial is beyond the methods of the empirical sciences. All that can be said from the viewpoint of the natural sciences is that the course of evolution can be and probably is random relative to the combined resources of the natural sciences. (10) Emergent Probability and Design of the Universe. Lonergans accounts of classical methods, statistical methods, and randomness are directly rele- vant to the question of intelligent design. Classical methods explain how and why organized complexity functions. Statistical methods analyze the prob- abilities of conditions coming together for the emergence and survival of complex cycles. Schemes of recurrence arise when appropriate conditions are assembled at in the same vicinity at the same time. This assembly occurs randomly and non-systematically, and yet in ways that conform to the ideal frequencies of probabilities. In other words, there are probabilities for events in an environment randomly coming together to make possible the emergence of a new organized scheme of recurrence. Even more importantly, once simple schemes occur, they themselves can constitute the conditions for the emergence of still more complex schemes. This means that the emergences of lower and simpler schemes actually change the probabilities for the emergence of subsequent, more complex schemes.34 34 The argument for this claim is beyond the limits this article.

His calculation of the probability of emergence of organic schemes is predi- cated on the assumption that probabilities are unchanging and unaffected by the prior emergence of less complex schemes. Lonergan on the other hand shows how emerging complexity actually changes the probability of the emer- gence of even greater complexity. Lonergan s analysis makes it possible to say some things about the whole- ness of the evolving universe based on scientific methods as such, without yet being able to fill in the details that would result from the sustained employ- ment of those methods. According to Lonergan, the universe to be known by classical and statistical methods will be intrinsically evolutionary and has intrinsic elements of randomness. As he puts it, the universe has "an upwardly but indeterminately directed dynamism."35 It is "an incomplete universe head- ing toward fuller being," but in a radically, indeterminate fashion.36 "Emer- gent probability" is his name for the wholeness of the evolving universe that is to be filled in and fully known through the practices of scientific methods37 - "emergent," because cycles emerge, begin to function and survive as long as their requisite conditions are in place; "probability" because the non-system- atic, random assembly of conditions nevertheless occurs according to ideal frequencies; "emergent probability" because once cycles at one level begin to function, they increase the probabilities of emergence of the next level of more complex cycles. In this way Lonergans approach calls into question the calculations that provide the fundamental premises of Dembskis arguments. This, for Lonergan, is the "design" that should be the focus of any discus- sion of intelligent design. He refers to it as the "immanent intelligibility" of world process, the order of the evolving world as evolving. As he put it, the universe is a "world process in which the order or design is constituted by emer- gent probability" 38 Clearly Lonergan s approach is radically different from that of the stan- dard intelligent design theorists. His focus is not some particular instance of organized complexity that has not been, or allegedly cannot be explained by current scientific understandings. His focus is, rather, the intelligibility, the design of the process of evolution itself. Significantly, his view of the intel- ligible design of emergent probability is independent of the present state of scientific investigations. It is independent of the eventual determination of either classical or statistical "laws." He can leave the investigation of partic- 35 Insight, p. 659; also p. 497. i6 Insight, p. 471. 37 Insight, pp. 145-49.

Byrne I ular instances of organized complexity up to methodical scientific investiga- tion, and focus instead on the general design implied by the combined use of those methods. Transcendent Purpose and God's Intelligence To say that the actual course of evolution is random relative to the per- spective of the combined natural sciences does not necessarily rule out the possibility that it may have an intelligibility, value, and purpose that tran- scends the specialized intelligibilities sought by those sciences. Lonergan went on to explore how this can be so. He proposed a way of thinking about the compatibility of a divinely authored transcendent purpose and a radically contingent, randomly evolving universe that is comparable to neo-Darwinian understandings. Lonergans approach begins by asking different kinds of questions than those pursued by the standard forms of the intelligent design argument. While the standard arguments attempt to show that this or that pattern in the natural world can only be explained by postulating the intervention of a divine designer, his alternative approach shifts the focus by asking whether the entirety of the evolving world itself has an explanation. Any particular instance of organized complexity may very well be explainable in virtue of a series of transmutations and propagations. Still, each and every instance of organized complexity is but a component in the whole of the course of evolution. To ask about the entirety of the course of evolution itself is to ask questions very different in kind from questions about the origins of this or that design. These further questions are not about how this or that complex pattern evolved from a predecessor, or even how it is related to a series of predecessors. Rather, questions about the whole of evolution are questions such as: Why does the natural, living world evolve at all? Why is it not static, with every living being present and perfectly adapted from the start, as was assumed for so many centuries before Darwin? Why does it actually evolve in the ways that it does? Why does it evolve according to emergent probability, rather than through Lamarkian mechanisms? Why indeed are the "laws" of physics, chemistry and biology the way they are, rather than having some other conceivable form? Such questions do not ask for an explanation of this or that pattern or organism within the evolutionary history of the world; they ask for an explanation of the actual, contingent evolutionary history of the world itself.39 These are questions that can only be answered by asking about what might transcend the evolving universe. They are questions about God. 39 William Whewell took this sort of approach; see Ruse, op.cit., pp. 75-77. Compare also Barr, op.cit.,pp. 11-12.

I think it is best to begin with the frank admission that human beings cannot have any very determinate idea of what God is like. God is utterly beyond human comprehension. No matter what way we have of conceiving of God, that is not what or who God is. Our ways of conceiving of God all pale in comparison to what God is. I think much of the discussion about science and religion and intelligent design has suffered dearly from a failure to admit this fact at the very outset. In effect, the debate about intel- ligent design both pro and con is vitiated by anthropomorphic assumptions about God. On both sides of the debate, there is altogether too much confi- dence in presuming to know what God is like. In his great study of Darwins development of his theory, Dov Ospovot quotes Darwins contemporary, William Whewell: "We are not to assume that we know the objects of the Creators design, and put this assumed purpose in place of a physical cause." It would be well for all to take those words to heart today.40 And yet it is desperately important that we try our best to talk about God in the least inadequate way possible. We cannot not try to talk about God. But if we begin with a clear awareness that every way we try to talk about God will inevitably fall short of the reality of God, this at least can chasten us. It can make us circumspect about what we say. It can inspire us to try to find the least inadequate ways of talking about God, especially when we stand before the dazzling majesty of an evolving universe that is a mere 15 billion years into its life story. Perhaps not surprisingly, when Lonergan himself turned to the nigh impos- sible task of talking about God, he turned to the ecstasy of scientific discovery as his modest point of departure. He wrote, so movingly: Our subject has been the act of insight or understanding, and God is the unrestricted act of understanding, the eternal rapture glimpsed in every Archimedean cry of "Eureka!"41 Scientific insights, even everyday insights, are eureka moments that inti- mate what God is like. Evelyn Fox Keller tells a story about Nobel Prize winner Barbara McClintock. When she was taking a final exam for her geology course, she became thoroughly enthralled in her insights: "I was delighted, I just enjoyed it immensely." Her absorption was so complete that, at the end of the period, she couldn't remember her own name in order to write it on the exam book! 42 This is a dramatic manifestation of the rapture of insight. Anyone who has had that experience of discovery knows vividly what it is like. 40 Ospovot - op.cit., pp. 13-14. 41 Insight, p. 706. 42 Evelyn Fox Keller - A Feeling for the Organism: The Life and Work of Barbara McClintock.

Byrne For Lonergan the rapture of understanding is the beginning point for a least inadequate way of talking about God. He approached the question of the least inadequate way to speak about God by suggesting that God can be conceived analogically as an unrestricted act of understanding that is totally enraptured with every single person and organism and mutation and elementary particle decay in the entire story of the universe. For Lonergan God is not one who looks down upon the universe from afar. He rather conceives God s unrestricted understanding as an intensely intimate identification with the intelligibility of everything about every thing. As such God is so utterly caught up with every miniscule emerging complex cycle - and even every cycle going extinct - that God totally loses Godself in everything. God is a passionate God, whose passion is poured into the intel- ligent identification with and understanding of everything about everything without condition or limit or restriction. Lonergan did not arrive at this way of conceiving of God by using the scientific methods. Neither did it come from some privileged, direct intuition of God. A human being would have to understand everything about every- thing in order to fully and truly understand what it is to be a passionate, unre- stricted, understanding, God. Since human beings do not have anything like unlimited understanding, it is only possible to conceive of unrestricted under- standing indirectly, by way of analogy. Hence Lonergan s approach is based on analogous understanding, an "imperfect understanding," an extrapolation, as he puts it. It is an extrapolation from what it is like for a human being to understand something limited, toward what it would be like to understand everything about everything without limitation. Lonergan s extrapolation is based upon two things: (1) the personal self- appropriation of the real occurrences and insights in one's own life and ones scientific practices, and (2) the unrestricted inquiring spirit that is the foun- dation of all scientific and indeed all forms of human knowledge. Human insights form the basis for this imperfect, analogical understanding; the unre- strictedness of our inquiry, of our limitless, restless yearning to understanding gives some glimpse of what truly unrestricted understanding might be like.43 Lonergan explores the implications of this analogical conception in great detail. Toward the end of that exploration, he proposes that just about all of the things that can be said about this unrestricted understanding are the sorts of things that traditional theists would ascribe to God, although with subtle refinements. Among other things, Gods unrestricted act of understanding would intimately understand the actual, evolving world in all its myriad of details, with its unique random pattern of intricate twists, turns, transmuta- tions, and dead ends. 43 See Insight, pp. 665-67. Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia V$^ V~~" "~"~"~ 63-2007 uaiRPF ! 106</page><page sequence="23">Lonergan, Evolutionary Science, and Intelligent Design 915 So it is that every tendency and force, every movement and change, every desire and striving is designed to bring about the order of the universe in the manner in which in fact they contribute to it.44 Gods understanding would also encompass how to actualize the actual order of the course of the evolving world (because if God did not understand this, something would be missing from God s understanding, and it would not be unrestricted). Most importantly, however, passionate, unrestricted understanding would understand why this design is being realized. That is to say, God would under- stand the transcendent value and purpose that would make it worthwhile to realize the actual, emergent probability design of sequences of events from out of all the others that could have been selected. Because of this unrestricted understanding of that value, then, God s creative choice would not be arbitrary or absolutely random. What would be properly regarded as random as far as the methods of the natural science are concerned, would be comprehended as special and important and transcendently valuable and worth realizing by the unrestricted act of understanding. As Lonergan puts it, God s unrestricted understanding "is the ground of value, and it is the ultimate cause of causes for it overcomes contingence at its deepest level."45 In other words, God conceived as unrestricted understanding would bring about each particular complex cycle and organism by bringing about the entirety of evolution, in which each instance of organized complexity is a component. Only an unrestricted act of understanding could do what no human mind can do - intimately understand each and every one of the myriad of intricate details and connections as components in the whole actual course of evolution - not one by one, but by understanding the wholeness, the order, the design universe itself. Because of its unrestrictedness, Gods act of understanding would also understand every other evolutionary course that might have been picked out of the "grab bag" of "all the possible sequences of events compatible with the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology." And it would understand the reason and purpose and value of selecting one over all other possibilities, a reason and purpose so profound and transcendent that every event, every cycle and every thing is made precious beyond human comprehension. Hence Lonergan s approach does more than just assert the compatibility of theistic faith and evolutionary science. Beyond this, Lonergan shows how it is possible to reconcile the affirmation of divine purpose with an evolving world shot through with scientific randomness and contingency. The ultimate design, meaning, and purpose of the evolving world is a transcendent mean- 44 Insight, p. 688 (emphasis added); see also p. 673. 45 Insight, pp. 679-80. ~- i r^j Revista Portuguese de Filosofia r- - 107!

All human understandings fall short of that unrestricted sweep. For human understandings, therefore, the design or pur- pose of the evolving universe will remain the "mystery of mysteries," Darwin's own claim not withstanding.46 For this reason the standard intelligent design approaches to the question of divine design and purpose pale by comparison. Does the Transcendent Designer Exist? Thus far I have presented Lonergan s approach to question of the design and designer of the contingent, randomly evolving universe as an hypothesis. As such it is comparable to a hypothetical possibility conceived of by a theo- retical scientist that awaits experimental testing. Hence it is not yet an argu- ment from design because it does not argue from the emergent probability of the universe to the existence of a divine, unrestricted act of understanding. Lonergan does eventually take this next step. He is quite clear, however, that in order to proceed from the hypothesis to the affirmation there is a need for yet another, absolutely crucial premise, namely: "Being is completely intel- ligible." This premise states a claim that is at the heart of what Lonergan later came to call "intellectual conversion."47 It may in fact be the most important claim in all of his philosophy. In light of the premise that being is completely intelligible, Lonergan proceeds to argue that there can be no mere matters of fact, no unexplained contingency, no absolute randomness.48 He continues: if there are no mere matters of fact that remain ultimately unexplained, then no con- ditions are fulfilled simply at random; all are fulfilled in accord with some exemplar [design]; so there must be an exemplary cause that can ground the intelligibility of the pattern [of emergent probability] in which are or would be fulfilled all conditions that are or would be fulfilled.49 This exemplary cause, according to Lonergan, is the unrestricted intelligi- bility of God - the unrestricted act of understanding. It would require a separate article to adequately examine Lonergans justification for his premise of the complete intelligibility of being, as well as for the details of the argument itself. For the present it will have to suffice to 46 See The Origin of Species, p. 25; see also Voyage of the Beagle.

Moreover, I do not think that any intelligent design argument can be warranted without some such premise. Lonergan argues to this premise through his philosophy of self-appro- priation and its cognitional theory. But few people undertake the long and demanding period of philosophical reflection required to arrive at a personal affirmation of the complete intelligibility of being. For most people the ulti- mate meaningfulness of the world (or lack thereof) is implicit in their most basic faith commitments. Toward the end of his career, Lonergan frequently remarked that "Faith is the knowledge born of religious love."50 In the throe of the unconditional love that God pours into the hearts of human beings, the world is experienced as more than mere matter, more than mere random occurrences, more than a mere brute fact. Faith born of unconditional love discerns that there is transcendent meaning and purpose beyond the proper, limited forms of contingency and randomness evident and necessary to scien- tific investigation. Faithfulness to the gift of unconditional love means affirm- ing ultimate meaningfulness because one is in the throe of that love, without actually knowing what that meaning and purpose is.51 This faith-based sense of meaningfulness is the existential underpinning of most peoples notions that designs in nature imply a designer. This conviction of ultimate meaningfulness lies at the heart of the faith lives of a great many people. It is a most important and valid source for further reflection on the questions of design. Yet by itself it is not yet an appropriate basis for a philosophical argument, and still less is it appropriate for intro- duction into methodical scientific investigations. This observation implies a double-limitation. On the one hand, the premise that being is completely intelligible is undecidable from the viewpoint of the scientific methods them- selves. For that very reason, the scientist as scientist ought not pronounce upon the existence or non-existence of a transcendent meaning or purpose or designer of evolution. On the other hand, this also means that it is inap- propriate to introduce premises about transcendent value or purpose or their divine origin into the conduct of scientific investigations. Both are unwar- ranted intrusions of one kind of pursuit of human knowledge into the field of another. Believers may esteem the achievements of empirical scientists, but appropriately reject their denials of the transcendent as going beyond empiri- cal justification. Scientists as human beings may deny or affirm transcendent purpose and divine authorship, but as scientists they should recognize that these matters are distinct from empirical scientific knowledge proper.

Byrne this reason that scientists have properly opposed attempts to introduce intel- ligent design arguments into scientific explanations. I have sketched Lonergan s philosophy of science and its contributions to the debates about intelligent design. His is a distinctly different kind of argu- ment from design, one that I believe opens an alternative path where so often the debate has reached impasses. I hope that this article will help to promote fruitful explorations of the relationships between faith and natural science that move beyond these impasses.
