<plain_text><page sequence="1">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) INDUCTION, SCIENCE AND CAUSATION: SOME CRITICAL REFLECTIONS* YAMINE BOUGUENAYA MERMER Soon after our introduction to the world, we discovered that the things that happened around us were in some way interrelated; particular actions usually gave rise to particular consequences. Thus, we became familiar with the possibility of 'explaining' things: something moves 'because' we push it; a ball drops 'because' we lift it and then release it, etc. Soon we expected to 'explain' everything in this manner, but came to realize that each explanation of this kind requires others. We see an object fall when we release it, but then we wonder why the released object falls. Science is a continuation of this process. Science has two main goals: first, explanation of what has been observed and, second, prediction of what will be observed. Both explanation and prediction involve laws. To put it very simply, the business of science is to collect data and then generalize the regularities exhibited therein. These generalizations are then called laws. Once a generalization is conferred the status of law, it is considered as necessary in the sense that it states what invariably happens. Thus formulated, a law becomes both an explanatory and a predictive principle. THE CAUSAL LAWS OF NATURE ARE NOT EXPLANATORY Let us analyze the problem of explanation in science with the help of an example. Although oversimplified, it nevertheless illustrates the problem quite well: Whenever we throw a stone, we know that it will fall. Why? Because each time a physical body has been thrown, it has fallen. Since this has always happened and there is no reason it should not carry on doing so, we conclude that the relation between 'the thrown stone' and 'its falling' is a universal principle. We call it the 'law of gravity.' Thus, we believe that a stone falls because of gravity and infer that it is this law of gravity that is responsible for The author wishes to acknowledge that she has greatly benefited from the collection of Risala-e Nur by Bediuzzeman Said Nursi in formulating the methods and arguments used in this paper.</page><page sequence="2">244 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation the falling of bodies. In short, we see that things always fall when they are lifted and released and we call this state of affairs the 'law of gravity. ' Then we claim that things fall because of gravity! This is obviously a vicious circle. We can never use gravity to explain the fall of physical bodies without begging the question. From this it can be concluded that the causal laws of science are derived from experience and therefore cannot be used to explain that same experience. That is, causal laws cannot be explanatory because they are empirical. They can at most be descriptive. The philosophical analyses of scientific explanations have given rise to several explanatory theories such as the deductive nomological theory, the functional theory, the classical theory, the conditional theories, the probabilistic theories, etc. Except for the deductive theory1, these theories do not explicitly involve laws. However, they are all causal and the conditions they propose are all empirical. In some of these theories, the laws are not stated explicitly because they are sufficiently well known to be taken for granted, or else because it is not yet known what they are. A major dispute in philosophy is concerned with the question whether deductive nomological explanations are the only truly adequate scientific explanations and all other kinds are really its disguised versions. The deductive nomological model of explanation and prediction still continues to provoke much discussion. Initially, the discussion centred around whether this model is applicable to explanations outside of the physical sciences. More recently, many philosophers have argued that this model does even not provide us with a correct account of explanations in the physical sciences. The problem with these models of explanation lies in the role they assign to laws in scientific explanation. THE CAUSAL LAWS OF NATURE ARE NOT PREDICTIVE Indeed, in physical sciences laws are attributed 'necessity' and 'universality'. In other words, science presupposes the so-called uniformity of nature. The belief in the uniformity of nature consists in affirming that everything that has happened or will happen is an instance of some general causal laws to which there are no exceptions. This hypothesis is primordial in science. For science purports to be basically inductive. Science is not satisfied merely with describing what we observe directly; it is concerned with establishing 'knowledge' of (as yet) unobserved facts. No matter how extensively an empirical science may use the deductive techniques of mathematics, its inferences are ultimately inductive, because it claims to fulfil the knowledge-extending function. It purports to establish causal laws, that is, to find uniformities, such as the laws of motion, to which, so far as our experience extends, there are no exceptions. In this search, science has been quite successful, and it may be conceded that in general such uniformities have held hitherto. Science generalizes these uniformities and accepts them as 'universal* and 'necessary' laws, thus inferring that these causal laws are both explanatory</page><page sequence="3">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 245 and predictive. However, these laws are established on experience. This means that the proposition that expresses a natural law is an empirical matter of fact and cannot be an a priori certainty. If two events are united by an empirical law, they are still distinct and separate. Indeed, this was decisively set out by Hume: To convince us, that the laws of nature and all of bodies, without exception, are known only by experience, the following reflections may, perhaps, suffice. Were any object presented to us, and were we required to pronounce concerning the effect, which will result from it, without consulting past observation: After what manner, I beseech you, must the mind proceed in this operation? It must invent or imagine some event, which it ascribes to the object as its effect: And it is plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary. The mind can never find the effect in the supposed cause, by the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the effect is totally different from the cause and consequently can never be discovered in it.2 What Hume rightly pointed out is that if two events are distinct, they are distinct: that is, from a statement which does no more than assert the existence of one of them it is impossible to deduce anything concerning the existence of the other. This is a mere tautology but it has the merit of bringing out the fact that science bases its canons of justification on unjustified causation. If we believe in causation we have to maintain that there is a necessary causal connection between objects and events. That is to say when, in experience, we have observed two events to be constantly conjoined, we think that one event (A) causes the other (B). We do not say that "A causes B" because logically proceeds from A, or because we found that A has the appropriate properties to produce B. We say that "A causes B" just because so far we have observed that A and always coexist. The proposition which describes the initial condition A does not entail the proposition which describes B. How can, then, the coexistence of A and be called 'law,' thus inferring that there is a causal connection between A and and that this connection is necessary? This is a manifest contradiction: A and are logically distinct from one another and consequently cannot be necessarily connected. That is, a proposition which expresses a causal law of nature is not logically true and therefore cannot be ascribed necessity. Since causal laws of nature are not necessary, there is no evidence and no logical reason to believe that they will be fulfilled in the future. THE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTION Russell questions the situation and asks: Have we any reason, assuming that they [the laws] have always held in the past, to suppose that they will hold in the future? . . . 'When two</page><page sequence="4">246 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation things have been found to be often associated, and no instance is known of the one occurring without the other, does the occurrence of one of the two, in a fresh instance, give any good ground for expecting the other?' On our answer to this question must depend the validity of the whole of our expectations as to the future, the whole of the results obtained by induction, and in fact practically all the beliefs upon which our daily life is based.3 In order to answer these questions Russell developed the so-called principle of induction. His hope was to establish the legitimacy of the scientific concept of evidence. Russell knew that the fact that two things have been often found together and never apart is not, by itself, sufficient to prove that they will be found together in the next examined case. Russell attempted to circumvent the difficulties raised by Hume and formulated for this purpose an inductive principle which would enable him to know that the future will follow the same causal laws as the past. This principle, which he called the principle of induction, may be briefly stated as follows: The greater the number of cases of a law in which A has been found associated with (A and are classes of events), the more probable it is that A is always associated with B. And a sufficient number of cases of association of A with will make this law approach certainty. Russell declared that his inductive principle was "not capable of being disproved by an appeal to experience . . . and equally incapable of being proved by an appeal to experience".4 Clearly, the reason why the inductive principle can neither be proved nor disproved is that it calls for experience of the future which is, as a matter of fact, impossible: We have no experience of the future. As a matter of logic, this principle is based on the assumption that the number of cases of a law fulfilled in the past afford evidence that that law will be fulfilled in the future. However, this assumption is the very problem that needs to be solved. The induction principle was supposedly devised to solve this problem, and hence induction cannot be based on it. In other words, the inductive principle begs the very question at issue: the justification of our expectations about the future on the ground of our experience of the past. Thus, the attempt to legitimize the cognitive claims of science for future applications on the basis of past successes is an attempt to justify induction inductively. Since the justifiability of induction is precisely the question at issue, induction cannot legitimately be used for its own justification. A currently favoured position is to contend that in order to justify induction, it is not necessary to show that inductive inferences yield true conclusions from true premises, but rather, they yield probable conclusions from true premises. However, if 'probable' is understood in a frequency sense ? roughly, that which is probable is that which happens often, it is impossible to show that induction produces probable conclusions. For Hume's argument showed not only that it is impossible to prove that every inductive inference with true premises will have a true conclusion, but also that it is impossible to prove</page><page sequence="5">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 247 that any inductive inference with true premises will have a true conclusion/All that can be proved is that every future inductive inference with true premises may have a false conclusion. If 'probable' is understood in the sense of confirmation, it may be possible to show that inductive conclusions are probable, but this does not provide any reason for preferring probable conclusions over improbable ones. To say that an inductive conclusion is probable in the sense of confirmation means that one would be rationally justified in accepting it on the basis of the available evidence, that is, on the basis of its premises. In other words, the justification of induction lies in its rationality. This answer, however, is totally unsatisfactory. The problem is precisely this: 'Is it rational to accept the usual canons of induction?' As this amounts to asking whether the accepted canons of induction fulfil the knowledge-extending function, the question Hume raised remains unanswered. In short, given that a proposition is probable in a frequency sense, what reason is there for expecting it to happen? Given that a proposition is probable in the confirmation sense, what reason is there for believing it to be true? The end is a dilemma. These questions reforrfiulate Hume's problem. The introduction of the concept of probability does not resolve the problem of induction. SCIENCE: A SACRED COW As Russell admits: "The problem of the justification of induction is one of the most difficult and most debated problems of Western philosophy, "5 If induction cannot be justified it means that there is no reason to accept a scientifically established conclusion as embodying knowledge. To put it more simply, science cannot claim to yield knowledge if it cannot justify induction because 'scientific knowledge' is derived by induction. If science cannot yield knowledge, there is no logical reason to rely on it or to give it any credit whatsoever. Scientists may have convinced the layman that the methods of science are suitable for the establishment of knowledge of the world we live in: Aren't the accomplishments of science there for all to see? However, the situation is not that simple. David Hume's searching analysis has shown that this way of justifying the method of science is logically fallacious. He has shown, in fact, that the problem of legitimizing the cognitive claims of science is an extremely difficult one ? so difficult that even at present there is no accepted solution. Technology is basically the application of past experience. It is in fact the result of obeying the order in the universe the way things are created, that is, God's custom. Technology and the pragmatic successes of science cannot be passed off as knowledge. The problem of justification of the cognitive claims of science is not empirical: it is philosophical or logical. It does not concern the scientific method as a method of discovery. The problem is, instead, one of justification and evidence. Given that a conclusion is well supported by scientific evidence, on what grounds may we accept this conclusion as embodying knowledge? In other words, is the scientific concept of evidence a legitimate one? Can it be justifiably maintained that scientific results constitute</page><page sequence="6">248 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation knowledge? In order to answer such questions it is necessary to examine the logical structure of science. The kinds of inference employed in science must be analysed. In order to understand the problem science faces, let us begin by making a distinction between two kinds of inference: deductive (or demonstrative) and non-demonstrative. The conclusion of a valid deductive inference follows necessarily from its premises; the conclusion cannot be false if the premises are true. This type of inference is justified by its truth-preserving character. True premises can never lead to false conclusions. The truth preserving character of deductive inference is a result of the fact that any information given in the conclusion is already present, explicitly or implicitly, in the premises. Non-demonstrative inferences are those which lack the characteristics of deductive inference. In particular, in a non-demonstrative inference the conclusion may be false even though the premises are true, and the conclusion has a content not possessed by the premises. Deductive inference has the truth-preserving characteristic; non demonstrative inference has a content-extending function. From the point of view of logic, these characteristics are incompatible with each other. Deduction has the truth-preserving characteristic precisely because it sacrifices the content extending function. Non-demonstrative inference has the content-extending function precisely because it sacrifices the truth-preserving characteristic. 'Non-demonstrative inferences have the content-extending function' means only that the conclusion says something not said either explicitly or implicitly by the premises. The fact that a content-extending inference has true premises does not, by itself, provide any ground for accepting its conclusion as true. However, if there were types of non-demonstrative inference, which provide a reason for the acceptance of their conclusions, if they have true premises, such inferences would extend one's knowledge to include the additional content of the conclusion. Such inferences, if there are any, would have not only a content-extending function, but also a knowledge-extending function. Strictly speaking, the term 'induction' is used for any inference whose premises do not entail its conclusions, that is, they support it but do not, if true, logically exclude the possibility that it is false. However, it is often used in a looser sense to refer to any kind of non-demonstrative inference which has the property that the truth of its premises, though not necessitating the truth of its conclusion, provides good grounds for the acceptance of its conclusion. This definition of induction suggests that induction refers to a non-demonstrative inference which has a knowledge-extending function. We may summarize the situation as follows. Inductive inference is a kind of non-demonstrative inference. In order to distinguish inductive inference from other non-demonstrative inferences there must be a criterion for determining whether a given type of inference does, in fact, provide 'good grounds' for the acceptance of its conclusion if it has true premises. This, in</page><page sequence="7">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 249 turn, requires the consideration of the problem of what constitutes 'good grounds' for acceptance. This is precisely Hume's problem of the justification of induction. The problem of justifying inferences from the observed to the unobserved is of fundamental import for the logic of science. This problem can be stated as follows: 1. It is impossible to prove deductively that the conclusion of any non-demonstrative inference with true premises must be true. Since the content of the conclusion exceeds the content of the premises, there is no a priori reason why the premises cannot be true and the conclusion false. If it were possible to prove that the conclusion must be true if the premises are true, the inference would be deductive rather than non-demonstrative, and as such, it could not fulfil the knowledge-extending function that is supposed to characterise the scientific inference. 2. Any attempt to prove inductively that non-demonstrative inferences with true premises (i.e. induction) will have true conclusions, will involve vicious circularity: the justification of induction inductively. The conclusion follows inexorably that induction cannot be justified at all, and consequently, that the cognitive claims of science cannot be legitimized. Far from being objective or necessary, scientific knowledge does not even possess a cognitive value. Scientists usually reject all approaches that are not based on the scientific method as unscientific. They take it for granted that 'scientific knowledge' is synonymous with knowledge, and 'scientific' with rational. To justify a conclusion, it is sufficient to show that it is related to an adequate body of scientific evidence in terms of the accepted rules of inductive inference. It is widely accepted in one form or another that one is justified in accepting the canons of induction and science because this is just what it means to be rational. To ask for further justification is to ask for a justification for rationality. This connection between 'rationality' and the principles of scientific induction is an expression of the social approval of science. Science and its canons of induction are vindicated on the basis of the widespread social acceptability of science. This vindication fails, however, to legitimize the cognitive claims of science. On this vindication, science is, indeed, a sacred cow. Does the fact that the intellect cannot be the source of knowledge mean that actually there is no true knowledge, no truth? Does it mean that the reality of this world cannot be understood and that nothing can be explained, that everything is meaningless? As a matter of fact, many philosophers have supported this view. However, if this view is right, then there would be no reason to make science or study the universe other than for practical purposes. Indeed, if man could not understand the world then it would be impossible for him to acquire knowledge through experience and observation. However, man has been striving to find the truth. From this it can be understood that meaninglessness is contrary to human nature (fitrah). The very existence of science is an evidence for this search for meaning.</page><page sequence="8">250 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation The Qur'?n also asks us to look at the universe ( '?lam al-shah?dah) and acknowledge our Sustainer (Rabb); that is, the Qur'?n orders us to witness to the truth. Therefore, there is truth. But the intellect cannot find it by itself. Man does not produce truth; he only confirms it. Since science cannot produce knowledge, its method of justification, the scientific method, must be faulty. In order to pin down the flaw in the scientific method of justification, let us analyze the situation from the beginning. Science always looks for uniformities and formulates them as causal laws, that is, it pre supposes that there is a relation between cause and effect, then generalizes that causal relation into a law of nature. As we have seen, it wrongly attributes explanative and predictive properties to these causal laws of nature. To clarify this situation, we can look more closely at how laws are defined. They are generalizations based on recurring observations. For instance, when plants are watered they grow; when they are not, they don't. Science says: There is a relation between plants and water. This relation is a recurring one and therefore it can be generalized into a law of nature. The relations between the cause and the effect are contingent; they are not necessary as Hume clearly pointed out. But the laws based on these relations are mysteriously attributed to necessity. This mysterious jump from the contingency of a relation to the necessity of the repetitiveness of that relation is an 'inductive procedure', induction, however, is not guaranteed by logic; it is a contingent affair. No matter how often a contingent relation is repeated it remains contingent. Its repetitiveness does not change its nature. It does not turn it into a necessary relation. As we have mentioned, the validity of induction has not yet been established precisely because the presupposition of induction has to be both contingent and necessary, which is absurd. And the absurdity is only lightly veiled by the use of the phrase 'synthetic a priori' instead of 'contingent necessary.' THE CONCEPT OF CAUSATION This analysis of the problem of legitimizing the cognitive claims of science brings us to the relations between cause and effect. So let us begin from there. What is the nature of this relation? If we turn back to the history of philosophy, we will see that a lot has been said about the nature of causation. The 17th and 18th centuries have especially witnessed a long debate on causation. The concept of 'the cause is what generates an effect by acting' constituted the object of consensus in Western philosophy until the Middle Ages when Aristotle's theory of causation6 was adopted. Three causes, 'matter', 'form' and 'end' were accepted as they were, but the fourth was modified. The notion of 'motor cause' was substituted for that of 'efficient cause'; that is, 'the cause is what generates an effect by acting on another thing. ' Indeed, the scholastics distinguished four types of causes: the 'material cause' or 'what a thing is made of, the marble of a ball for example; the</page><page sequence="9">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 251 'formal cause' or 'what makes a thing be what it is', like the roundness of the ball; the 'final cause' or 'why a thing is', like the picking up of flowers when we go to the garden, for example; and the 'efficient cause' or 'what acts in order to make something exist', like fire makes the burn exist when coming in contact with the hand, that is, 'what produces a thing by acting on another thing'. This notion of 'efficient cause' introduced by the scholastics acquired a status which the relation of Aristotle's 'motor cause' to its effect would perhaps never have had: that of being the model of all causal relations. This type of causation was different from the three others because it implied an underlying basic relation. Fire, for instance, was the 'cause' of the burn because it was in relation with the hand. However, neither the relation of marble to the ball, nor the relation of the roundness to its ball, nor the relation between the picking up of flowers and the going out to the garden, seemed to presuppose such a subjecent relation. This relation looked moreover simpler than the other types of causal relations. They all possessed terms ? like the marble and its roundness or the fire and the burn ? which belonged to distinct categories. While the relation underlying the 'efficient' causation unified only entities that were both substances such as fire and hand and hence belonged to the same category. As it seemed simpler and thus more intelligible, the 'efficient' causation became progressively the causation par excellence. To be 'cause' meant to act on another thing to produce an effect. This modified conception of causation led to a new worldview: mechanism. The world was not any more made of substances, composed of a matter and a form and acting in view of an end, as it used to be believed. It was a world of objects which were independent but acted on each other and, in this way, formed a whole. Thus formulated 'efficient' causation became one of the major preoccupations of the most critical minds. How can fire cause burn? Indeed, this was decisively set out by Hume: To convince us that the laws of nature and all operations of bodies, without exception, are known only by experience, the following reflections may, perhaps, suffice. Were any object presented to us, and were we required to pronounce concerning the effect, which will result from it, without consulting past observation: After what manner, I beseech you, must the mind proceed in this operation? It must invent or imagine some event, which it ascribes to the object as its effect: And it is plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary. The mind can never find the effect in the supposed cause, by the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the effect is totally different from the cause and consequently can never be discovered in it.7 What Hume rightly pointed out is that if two events are distinct, they are distinct: that is, from a statement which does no more than assert the existence of one of them it is impossible to deduce anything concerning the</page><page sequence="10">252 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation existence of the other. This is a mere tautology but it has the merit of bringing out the fact that science bases its canons of justification on unjustified causation. If we believe in causation we have to maintain that there is a necessary causal connection between objects and events. That is to say, when, in experience, we have observed two events to be constantly conjoined, we think that one event (A) causes the other (B). We do not say that "A causes B" because logically proceeds from A, or because we found that A has the appropriate properties to produce B. We say that "A causes B" just because so far we have observed that A and always coexist. The proposition which describes the initial condition A does not entail the proposition which describes B. How can then the coexistence of A and be called 'law,' thus inferring that there is a causal connection between A and and that this connection is necessary? This is a manifest contradiction. A and are logically distinct from one another and consequently cannot be necessarily connected. What is the nature of the relation which ties the so-called cause to the so-called effect? What is the nature of the so-called causal explanation? These are questions that the philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries asked. They all believed that the relations between the constituents of the world had to be explained and they proposed different hypotheses to achieve this goal. But they did not agree on the nature of causality. We should note at this point that if causality occupied a central place in the philosophical debate of the 17th and 18th centuries, it was not because it was the object of unanimity; rather, on the contrary, because it was judged problematic and disputable. By the middle of the 18th century, causation was therefore not the object of any consensus. The consensus that had lasted for two thousand years broke off into two fractures: the metaphysical fracture, that is, rationalism, and the epistemological fracture, that is, empiricism. All still talk about 'causes' but they don't agree on the relation between an 'effect' and what is presented as its 'cause'. Causation is not only problematic; it is a real problem. It is this problem that Kant attempted to solve at the end of the century. His 'solution' of the problem has been accepted by many philosophers as a reduction of the two fractures. According to Kant, knowledge starts with experience but is not totally derived from it. Causation has to exist because without it we cannot know. It is a necessary condition of the possibility of organized and coherent experience. However, it only concerns phenomena. We don't need to discover what makes a cause what it is as Hume claims. We just accept that there are causes and that they act on the effects otherwise we would not be able to know. For the same reasons, Kant dismisses the attempts of the rationalists to explain the world without causation. Those attempts go beyond the world of phenomena which is the only world we have access to. In short, "the world in which causality reigns is not the world of things as they are (noumeno) but as they appear to us (phenomena). As for us, we cannot go beyond phenomena."8 In this way the consensus is said to have been restored: causes are entities which generate an effect by acting on another thing. This 'restoration'</page><page sequence="11">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 253 is only apparent. Because if "the world of causation is not the world of things as they are but as they appear to us only", then the initial problem of justifying inferences from the observed to the unobserved remains unsolved. If science deals only with the world as it appears to us then it can only be descriptive: it cannot claim to yield knowledge. Kant's 'solution' does not constitute an answer to Hume's arguments. To overcome the difficulty raised by Hume, Hegel developed the so called dialectical logic. He failed, however, to solve the problem too. Let us recall the difficulty: what warrants one to assert that an empirical regularity is the manifestation of a necessary relation between cause and effect, or that an empirical regularity can be the manifestation of a law. This same difficulty has more recently nurtured the long debate opened up by Popper, Carnap and the neo-positivists. It is still at the centre of the problems created by the causal interpretation both in the physical sciences and in the social sciences. Causation has put science in a difficult position, to say the least. The scientific causal laws do not explain particular phenomena as it is commonly believed. Instead, the causal explanation requires these laws to be explained! CAUSATION - ANTITHESIS OF AW HID However it is interpreted, causation denotes the relation between two events or states of affairs in which one brings the other about or produces it. It may be argued that no one thinks that causation operates in the way an agent produces an effect. They think it is only a rough representation, a convenient anthropomorphic image or as some say 'an approximation of reality.' However, a thing is either true or false. Causation infers that the cause(s) mysteriously generates the effect. So if causation is true, if causes have the slightest effect on effects, that is, if causes have the power to produce the effects then tawhfd has to be reconsidered and, vice-versa, if tawh?d is true, causation has to be reconsidered. If causes are attributed the power to 'generate' or 'produce' even in an indirect way and even if this power is very restricted, it is an insinuation that causes are partners to God in His creation. If we say that causes are creative, that is, if we atrribute any power or any properties to causes themselves then we would have to accept that causes produce the effects and therefore own them. This is causation. Since everything is created together with its cause within order, to atribute the effect to the cause amounts to distributing all the creation among causes. Indeed, if each cause owned its effect and created it what would be left to God, 'the Creator of everything?' As can be seen from the history of Islamic thought, similar questions had been addressed by Muslim thinkers long before the problem arose in Western philosophy: What is the role of God in everyday events? Do objects have a nature that governs their behaviour? Does an event cause another? Such questions occupied the minds of Muslim thinkers and became the subject of a long debate among them.</page><page sequence="12">254 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation Some, like Ibn Sina (980-1037), believed that the physical world contained objects that were independent of one another. One event was thought to cause another, and objects were thought to possess an inherent nature that causes them to behave in certain ways. These ideas, however, were disputed by al-Ghaz?l? (1058-1111) who is considered to be one of the most influential thinkers of Islam. Al-Ghaz?l? rightly believed that the acceptance of causation limits the power of God. His concern about the continuing interaction of God with everyday events can be clearly seen in his idea of continuous creation. Al Ghaz?l? held that objects have nothing in their own nature that causes them to endure over time. Objects continue to exist because God creates them anew each moment. Therefore, causes do not cause effects: what appears to be a causal relation is only a contiguity. For al-Ghaz?l?, it is God's custom, that once an object has been created, He continues to create it over and over again. Thus, the uniformity of the physical world is the manifestation of God's custom ? not of causation. An object does not possess an independent existence that causes it to persist. Rather, it persists because it is God's custom to bring that same object into existence over and over again. Al-Ghaz?l?'s ideas about the nature of things and their interactions are very valuable. They may seem naive and unscientific to the modern man whose worldview is mainly mechanistic. In this worldview, the world is composed of independently existing things, each of which has inherent qualities that make that thing what it is. The objects continue to exist over time because of their inherent properties. Objects persist until they undergo a change in response to the action of an outside force. Moreover, the mechanical view assumes the existence of natural laws that can predict the behaviour of objects. New scientific theories, such as quantum theory, are fundamentally different from the mechanical causal view. According to these theories it is the mechanical view that is naive. The ideas of al-Ghaz?l? conform more to the reality than the mechanical view. There are many similarities between the ideas of al-Ghaz?l? in the eleventh century and the quantum theory in the twentieth century. Both agree, contrary to the common view, that objects do not possess inherent properties and independent existence. They both deny that the regularities in the behaviour of objects should be attributed to the existence of causal laws. They also deny that events are completely predictable. Like al-Ghaz?l?, Bediuzzaman Said Nursi (1873-1960) also stressed the fact that causation is the antithesis of tawhfd. He deemed the most serious disease of the present age to be weakness of belief in God. He diagnosed the source of this disease ? the tendency of man to claim independence of his Creator and to abstain from submitting to Him. Claiming ownership of himself, man is compelled to say that other beings own themselves and ultimately ascribe to them the power to create causes. Bediuzzaman demonstrated that the origin of atheistic philosophy and shirk (associating others with God) lies in causation. Bediuzzaman's analysis takes al-Ghaz?l?'s argument on causation a step further. Breaking the apparent relation between cause and effect, it shows how</page><page sequence="13">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 255 both causes and effects point to the attributes of their Creator and make Him known with all His Beautiful Names. According to Bediuzzaman, we should first say " *J? V " in order to be able to confirm " a \ Si " and not vice-versa. Since we live in the sphere of causes (da 'irat al-asb?b) we have to first examine causes and conclude that they cannot create anything that is, "aJj *i." Only then will we be able to draw conclusions about the sphere of Power (d?'irat al-qudrah), that is, the Creator and say " ? \ y . " It is important not to confuse these two spheres. As we can see from the history of Islamic thought, any confusion of these two spheres resulted in deviation from the straight path (al-?ir?t al-mustaq?m). If one accepts that God is the Creator, but applies this verdict, which concerns the sphere of Power (God), to the sphere of causes (i.e., the universe) he will have to wrongly ascribe creativity to causes. This standpoint was represented by the Mu'tazilites. They fell in error because they saw the view of the Jabriyyah as the only alternative. And in order to escape it they were compelled to attribute creativity to causes. They claimed that causes have the ability to create but this ability was given to them by God. Most of the Muslim scholars strongly criticized this view. Indeed, causes have been created by God. They have no inherent property with which to create. Causes are only a veil to God's power. They demonstrate His attributes. Although oversimplified, the following example illustrates the basic flaw in the Mu'tazilites' view on causality. A king's officials act under the king's authority and on his behalf but they are the executors. The king and his officials are of the same nature: they are both created. The king is in need of his officials in order to execute his affairs. The Mu'tazilites erroneously thought of causes as the officials of a king. Causes, however, are not of the same nature as their Creator. They are created by Him. The Creator is not in need of His creation. On the other hand, if one accepts that God is the Creator and causes do not have the ability to create but looks at the sphere of causes from the point of view of the sphere of Power (God), he will wrongly disregard causes and under the name of putting his trust in God, he will ignore the order in creation as though it had nothing to do with God. In this way he will be at variance with the order in the universe because it is God's will that man should have recourse to causes and thus revere God's sunnah. (The second stand mentioned above was represented by the Jabriyyah.) Both the Mu'tazilites and the Jabriyyah fell in error because they confused the two spheres. We live in the sphere of causes and we can only look at the universe from the point of view of that sphere. We observe the universe and understand that causes do not have any ability to create and that there must be a creator who has comprehensive qualities. Thus, while in the sphere of causes we make deduction about the sphere of Power: God has created causes adjacent to the effects and in this way He has put order in creation. The uniformity of the universe is the manifestation of this order.</page><page sequence="14">256 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation Causes are neither disregarded nor attributed creativity. They are used to attain to that knowledge of God. It is only when we realize that causes do not have any inherent quality that we can confirm the oneness of God and know Him and His attributes. To have recourse to causes is to revere God's sunnah, it is in fact to ask God to create the effect for us because nothing in the sphere of causes can create any effect. In this sense, to have recourse to causes is to worship God; it is a form of du'?'. Let us take the example of placing a piece of cotton in a fire, which is an example al-Ghazall used to illustrate the power of God. Al-Ghaz?ll argues that: (i) It is God who is responsible for making the cotton burn when it comes into contact with fire. (ii) It is not the fire that causes the cotton to burn. According to Bediuzzaman's analysis, this argument may be reformulated as follows: (i) Observation: When cotton is brought into the presence of fire it burns.9 (ii) Question: Who is responsible for this reaction?10 (iii) Study the universe to find the answer: To answer the above question we have to find out what qualities are needed to make cotton burn. For this we need to know how it burns.11 Roughly, we can say that whoever or whatever is responsible for the burning of cotton must know the cotton, the ashes (carbon), oxygen and the order according to which cotton burns. It must also have the power to control all of them and turn cotton into ashes, that is, it must have the qualities of a God. Fire, however, possesses none of these qualities. It is unconscious and blind. It has no power (it can be extinguished). Therefore, fire is not God : " ?S\*j " (There is no God . . ."). The one responsible for the burning of cotton must be the one who knows, makes and controls the fire, the cotton, the oxygen and indeed the milieu in which the burning takes place. He must have encompassing knowledge and power: He must be (the) God: " k\ *?\ " ([there is no God] except He)." We conclude, thus, that effects cannot be attributed to causes. Both causes and effects make their Creator known to us. Indeed, the effects display such qualities that they dismiss their apparent causes, which are unconscious, blind and impotent. In this way both effects and causes point to the existence of a transcendental being together with his all-encompassing attributes such as knowledge and power.</page><page sequence="15">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 257 REFUTATION OF CAUSATION The universe is an inseparable whole. All things are connected with each other, forming one whole in which no part is any more fundamental than the other. The whole supports the parts which themselves constitute the whole. That is, without everything we can have nothing. Therefore, whatever is responsible for one thing must be responsible for everything. For this reason, it is not possible to attribute anything, however small it is, to contingent and limited causes. The latest discoveries of modern science, like the unity of the universe and the inseparability of its parts, are leading to a worldview where there is no room for fragmentation and determinism. The scientific approach, however, is founded upon causation. It is based on a deterministic and reductionist view of the world. Scientists do not deny the oneness of the universe, but, for practical purposes, they compartmentalize it. Then, they argue that each compartment is the product and consequence of its immediate causes, which are themselves transient and contingent.12 In order for causes to produce an effect, however small it is, they have to be able to produce the whole universe in which that effect takes place. For neither causes nor effects can exist without the whole universe; they cannot exist separately. For instance, in order for a tree to grow, the whole universe has to be there: soil and minerals, water, sunlight, gravity, the solar system, etc. In other words, if causes were responsible for the growth of a tree, each cause would have to be able to make and control the whole universe. For a tree cannot exist without the whole universe. Each cause would have to be able to see, know and have power over everything. It would have to be able to give life, to pursue meaningful aims, etc. Thus if we say that causes generate or cause the effect then we would have to accept that in every cause resides an infinite force and power. To summarise, the following points emerge very clearly: (1) Everthing is interrelated and interdependen, so whoever makes one thing must be the maker of all things. (2) So, the maker is one and he possesses all comprehensive power, knowledge, etc. (3) Thus, if we say that a cause produces its effect, this cause must be the Maker, it must have all comprehensive qualities in order to control all things. (4) That is, if causation is true, then each cause is God-like; it has absolute properties; that is, there are gods to the number of causes. (5) Since each cause is also an effect, that is, it is in a position of both dominance and subjection to all the rest, each would have to be, at the same time, omnipotent and impotent, which is absurd. (6) Since all things are contingent and limited but they all interact in harmony resulting in a faultless order, we conclude that they must be created and employed by One Absolute Being. When we look at beings, we see that through their order, mutual relationships and duties, they reject that they are anything other than the property and creation of a Single Creator. Take an insect for instance. It is a member of a species that is found all over the world. So whoever made that insect, made all the insects of that species. Moreover, that insect has a</page><page sequence="16">258 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation relationship with sunlight, with air, with the earth and the solar system, etc. It has a relationship with the whole universe. So whoever has created that insect and its species must have created the universe with all the beings in it. He must have all-encompassing knowledge and power. Thus each insect ascribes all other insects of its species and indeed all other beings in space and time to its Maker. In short, we have demonstrated, reductio ad absurdum, that causes cannot produce the effects contiguous to them and that a being, however small and insignificant it may seem, can only be the product of an Omnipotnt and Omniscient Being.13 Indeed, all things are interconnected in such a way that one thing cannot exist independently of the rest of the universe. From this fact, it can be concluded that whoever made one being here and now must have made all other beings. That is, all beings in space and time must be the products of One Omnipotent and Omniscient Being. This inference is inductive: a general and universal conclusion (all beings in space and time ? from past to future and everywhere ? are the products of One Absolute Being) is drawn from a set of premises based on experience (the observation of one being for instance, an insect here and now and the nature of its connections with other beings.) This type of inductive inference, however, is what we may call 'vertical induction.' It proceeds in two stages, (i) From one cause-effect to an Omnipotent and Omniscient One. (ii) From that Omnipotent and Omniscient One to all other causes-effects. CAUSES GLORIFY THEIR MAKER The Qur'an draws our attention to the countless benefits and purposes in the creation of beings.14 In this way, the Qur'an shows how far powerless causes are from following such purposeful aims and benefits. Causes, which are themselves crated, cannot plan anything let alone beneficial aims. Thus, the purpose and benefits in creation prove that causes do not make the effect; rather both the causes and the effects are the products of One who sees and follows the aims. For only one who is all-powerful, all-knowing and all-merciful can will such purposeful and beneficial aims. Causes as such are lifeless and powerless. To explain the nature of causality, Bediuzzaman gives the following example. When we look from far, the earth and the sky seem to be joined on the horizon. But when we get closer, we realize that there is a great distance between them. In the same way, when we look at the reality of causes from far, i.e., when we look at causes and what appear to be their effects without questioning, causes seem to be joined to the effects. But when we look intentionally and purposefully, as the Qur'an teaches us to do, i.e., when we question the situation and reflect on it, we come close to the reality. Then we see that the distance from the cause to the creation of the effects is so great that the hand of the greatest of causes cannot reach the creation of the most insignificant of effects. // is within this great distance between causes and effects that the Divine Names rise. When we question the relation between causes and effects, i.e., the way beings are created, we realize that causes cannot own the effects. Indeed, effects</page><page sequence="17">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 259 are so full of art and beneficial purposes that let alone their simple impotent causes, even if all cause are brought together, they would be unable to produce one single thing. ("O men! A parable is set forth [herewith]; hearken, then to it! Behold those beings whom you invoke instead of God cannot create [as much as] a fly, even were they to join all their forces to that end! And if a fly robs them of anything, they cannot [even] rescue it from it.! Weak indeed is the seeker, and [weak indeed] the sought!" Qur'?n 22: 73). For each thing to exist there is need for infinite power and knowledge. Thus there must exist a possessor of absolute power and knowledge who directly creates the cause and the effect together. Let us consider another example given in the Qur'?n: Let man, then consider [the sources of] his food: [how it is] that We pour down water, puring it down abundantly: and then We cleave the earth [with new growth], cleaving it asunder, and thereupon we cause grain to grow out of it, and vines and edible plants, and olive trees and date-palms, and gardens dense with foliage, and herbage, for use and convenience to you and your cattle. (80: 24-32). By mentioning miracles (mu'jiz?t) of divine power15 in a purposeful sequence, these verses tie causes to effects and point to an aim at the conclusion with the words: "for use and convenience to you". This aim proves that within the sequence of all the causes and effects is a hidden disposer who sees and follows the aim, and that causes act as the foil of a mirror, they make him known. Indeed, with the phrase, "For use and convenience to you and your cattle", it dismisses all causes from the ability to create. It is in effect saying: "Rain comes from the sky in order to produce food for you and your animals. Since water does not possess the ability to pity and feel compassion for you and produce food, it means that the rain does not come, it is sent. ("He it is who has caused waters to come down from the sky ..." See Qur'?n 6: 99; see also 29: 63), and the earth produces plants and your food comes from there. But as it lacks feelings and intelligence, it is far beyond the ability of the earth to think of your sustenance and feel compassion for you, so it does not produce it itself. They are means with which One All-Wise and Merciful sends His blessing (ni'mah) and holds it out to living beings.16 And so from this explanation numerous divine names rise, like the Merciful (Rahman), the Provider (Razz?q), the Generous (KarTm), etc. To conclude, the fact that the qualities observed on effects cannot be found in the apparent causes shows that the owner of those qualities is not the set of apparent causes but someone else. Indeed, the simplicity and impotence of causes point to the qualities of the maker of the artful, purposeful and beneficial effects.</page><page sequence="18">U</page><page sequence="19">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 261 In short, everything is full of art and is being constantly renewed, and, like the effect, the cause of each thing is also created. For each thing to exist there is need for infinite power and knowledge. Thus, there must exist a possessor of absolute power and knowledge who directly creates the cause and the effect together.17 He has established an apparent causal relation and connection through the order in the universe to demonstrate His names. All things and causes act as the foil of a mirror. They reflect the attributes of their Maker, i.e., the divine names. They are signs (?y??) pointing to God's power through their impotence, to His knowledge through their ignorance, to his everlastingness through their ephemerality, and so on. It is as though each being, each cause, big or small, universal or particular, is making supplication through its disposition (fitrah). They are proclaiming the divine power and perfection through their powerlessness and deficiency. They are announcing: "There is no god but God." Just as the universe points to this truth of divine unity so does the Owner of the universe teach us this truth in the sacred books that He has revealed. The phrase: "There is no god but God" is the fundament of revelation and its truth is confirmed by the testimony of beings. It is the key to the Qur'?n, a key that makes possible to know the riddle that has reduced materialistic science and philosophy to impotence. The path of unity is the path of revelation. It is the only path that shows man his Master and Owner, and causes him to recognize his True Object of Worship Who possesses an absolute power that will guarantee all his needs. The Qur'?n is the only source that teaches us that the universe and the beings within it do not bear a meaning limited to themselves but testify to their Maker's unity and make Him known to us with all His attributes of perfection. It teaches what the universe is and what duties it is performing, In this sense every Muslim is a 'scientist.' Every Muslim should study the universe and see that all beings, through their order, mutual relationships and duties, and should utterly reject the false claims of materialistic reasoning. They reject that they are nothing but the property and creation of a Single Creator. Each rejects the false notion of chance and causation. Each ascribes all other beings to its Own Creator. Each is a proof that the Creator has no partners. Indeed, when the Creator's unity is known and understood correctly, it becomes clear that there is nothing to necessitate that causes should possess any power. So, they cannot be partners to the Creator. Then the Muslim scientist will say through his investigations and discoveries: "There is no god but God; absolutely one and unique and without partners." The universe is a document to be used by the believers. Because believing in God is, as the Qur'?n informs us, to assent with one's heart to the Creator with all His attributes supported by the testimony of the whole universe. The true affirmation of God's unity is a judgemen, a confirmation, an assent and acceptance that can find its Owner present with all things. It sees in all things a path leading to its Owner. It does not regard anything as an obstacle to His</page><page sequence="20">262 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation presence. For otherwise it would be necessary to tear and cast aside the universe in order to find Him.19 MATERIALISTIC EPISTEME: A CONJECTURE The deterministic worldview presents the Absolutely Self-Sufficient and Omnipotent Creator as being in need of powerless intermediaries. It gives causes a sort of partnership in His Lordship (Rub?biyyah). By seeing created beings, which are signs of their Creator, as creative and efficient causes it opens the way to associating partners with God. Causation, in our view, is therefore incompatible with tawh?d. Causation is the cornerstone of materialistic philosophy and of all doctrines leading to shirk. Thus, to show that causation is unfounded, irrational and illogical, is to undermine the materialistic paradigm of knowledge. Suppose a proposition in the form: "A causes B" where A and are classes of events, according to empiricists, event A is the cause of event if events like A are regularly succeeded, in circumstances like these, by events like B. It follows from this that every singular causal proposition "A causes B" is really general, since it implies a universal law, and it can be 'justified' only by induction. However, as has been mentioned, induction is unjustifiable20 and therefore a scientific statement cannot be proved. It is only a prejudice or, if we were to use the terminology of the Qur'?n, a conjecture21 (zann). Karl Popper contended that although such a statement is improvable, it remains in principle disprovable.22 According to this principle of falsification, a scientific theory holds until it is disproved and falsification, not verification, is the appropriate object of the observational and experimental procedures of science. This means that given a scientific statement, the conditions for its falsification have to be established, then it must be tested through sustained search for negative instances. Thus, a scientific statement cannot be disproved by an appeal to experience if no negative instances have been observed. According to the scientific method, if A has been found accompanied or followed by then there is a causal relation between A and B, i.e., "A causes B. " This proposition is valid if it hasn't been falsified, i.e., if no negative instances have been observed. This reasoning can be illustrated with a simplified example, as follows: "Water causes plants to grow" is a scientifically established conclusion. It can be 'tested'. Take a few plants. All are regularly watered except one (control). After some time, the plant which has not been watered wilts. Therefore, the statement that "Water helps plants to grow normally and remain green", is valid because it hasn't been disproved. In this example the validity of the hypothesis "water has an effect on the growth of plants" is tested by showing that plants don't grow in the absence of water. This is the same as saying that this hypothesis can be falsified only by showing that plants can grow in the absence of water. However, what was observed was simply that in the absence of water plants do not grow. The growth of plants, however, depends on innumerable factors. The absence of only</page><page sequence="21">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996} 263 one of these factors is enough for a plant not to grow. Therefore, this experiment only proves that plants don't grow in the absence of water and nothing more. And from this conclusion, it is logically impossible to deduce anything toward the hypothesis that "water has an effect on the growth of plants. This method of justification is thus illogical and fallacious. This kind of reasoning reminds us of the story of the Prophet Abraham (peace be on him) and Nimrod mentioned in the Qur'?n (see 2: 258). Nimrod argued with Abraham and claimed that like Abraham's God, he could grant life and deal death as well. In order to prove his claim, Nimrod asked for two prisoners to be fetched. He ordered the death of one and spared the life of the second. In this way he argued that he could grant life and deal death. His reasoning was that if he had had the second prisoner killed, he would not be alive. Therefore, he granted him life. This is similar to the argument of the scientists: "If there is no water, plants will wilt and die, therefore water 'gives life' to plants." Scientific statements are unprovable and also disprovable. However, there is no need to produce a counter-example ? as philosophy claims ? in order to disprove such statements. As far as we observe, water and the growth of plants are indeed contiguous, but this contiguity does, by no means, imply a causal relation: it is impossible to deduce that water causes plants to grow. The reason why the materialist scientists fall into error is that they take the contiguity of events for causation. That is if two (or more) events coexist, they conjecture that one causes the other. However, it is impossible to prove this conjecture simply because it is irrational. Indeed, the Qur'?n invites us to ask questions23 to uncover the veil of causes and to investigate the reality behind it. Does water possess the knowledge and power to grow plants? Does it know the order according to which plants are formed? Does it know the structures of all the plants it enters? Can it have authority over them, for water takes up its position and acts in a masterly way in all living beings? Can it have pity on them, for without its help we would all perish and die? Is it possible that water possesses any of these qualities? No. Water is a simple matter. It is lifeless, purposeless and void of consciousness. Obviously it has no mercy, no will, no knowledge, no power. It does not possess any of the qualities needed to produce a plant. For a plant can only exist within the whole universe. So to produce one single plant, one has to produce the whole universe in which it exists. It has to know the needs of all living beings, to take pity on them and answer their needs, etc. For this, all comprehensive qualities like knowledge, power, will, mercy, etc. are needed. Causes (water, soil, sunlight, the seed, etc.), however, have none of these qualities. Thus they must be in the employ of one who possesses such comprehensive qualities and whom we call God. The Qur'?n asks us to consider the endless benefits24 found in water and in the growth of plants and food so vital for life. This way, it makes us realize that causes cannot cause anything to exist because they do not possess any of the qualities needed to create. They have neither power, nor knowledge, nor will,</page><page sequence="22">264 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation nor mercy, nor anything. The Qur'an repeatedly stresses the fact that causes are not producers: they cannot be. Will they, then, ascribe divinity, side by side with Him, unto beings that cannot create anything ? since they themselves are created ? and neither are able to give them succour nor can succour themselves . . . Verily, all those whom you invoke instead of God are but created beings like yourselves: . . . Have they, perchance, feet on which they could walk? Or have they hands with which they could grasp? Or have they eyes with which they could see? Or have they ears with which they could hear? (see 7: 191-195).25 Hence, it is God alone who is the Creator of everything: "Such is God, your Sustainer; there is no deity save Him, the Creator of everything; worship, then. Him alone ? for it is He who has everything in His care" (Qur'?n 46: 102).26 As far as we understand, the Qur'?n tells us that: (1) The order in the universe indicates that the universe has a Creator. (2) This order also points to the Oneness of the Creator and is in fact a sign (ayah) for those who want to know Him. (3) No one can change the existing order. 4. These who deny that this order has a Creator are challenged to change the order if they can and make something without using the already existing order.27 This fact is clearly stated in the answer of the Prophet Abraham (peace be on him) to Nimrod: "Verily God causes the sun to rise in the east; cause it, then, to rise in the west. Thereupon, he who was bent on denying the truth remained dumbfounded" (Qur'?n 2: 258). Thus, for instance, when we observe the growth of plants, and see that plants grow when they are watered, we cannot conclude, as do materialist scientists, that water causes plants to grow, but as the Qur'?n teaches, that it is God who gives life to plants with water; this is God's custom (sunnat Allah). The Qur'?n says: "Are, then, they who are bent on denying the truth are not aware that. . . We made out of ( (y* ) water every living thing?" (Qur'?n 21: 30).28 THE NATURAL LAWS ARE FICTITIOUS Since causes do not make their effects and since both causes and effects are directly created, it means that the relation between a cause and the effect contiguous to it is not 'horizontal'. Let us clarify what we mean by this. Everything is directly connected to its Creator. All beings are related to each other through Him. This we may call the 'vertical approach. ' In Western philosophy, beings, things and events are erroneously thought to be directly connected to each other through causal relations. This we will call the 'horizontal approach'. The relation that holds between things is vertical. It is not horizontal. Each being or thing is vertically related to all others through God's absolute power, knowledge, will and mercy ... All beings are the property of the</page><page sequence="23">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 265 possessor of absolute power, knowledge, will, mercy ... He can send everything to the assistance of one individual.29 All things can be administered as a single thing by He Who has absolute power.30 When we observe the universe, we see orderly activity. We see events occurring in sequence, in order. The relationship between a cause and an effect is merely the order in which they occur. Indeed, how could water, soil and sunlight, for instance, be responsible for turning a seed into a huge tree? They have neither the knowledge, nor the power, nor the will and consciousness to do that. Imagine a man who sees a telephone for the first time. He sees that you can communicate with all of your friends all over the world by means of that telephone. Since he does not know that there is a main telephone exchange, he supposes that your telephone has a network within it with each of your friends' telephones. He imagines that each telephone is working as a main exchange. In the same way, materialist philosophers and scientists imagine that things and events are related to each other and call these illusory relations 'natural laws. ' They do not understand that things and events are only indicative. They indicate something other than themselves. They perform duties consciously and conform, as though knowingly, to the universal order in a way that infinitely exceeds their capacities and strength. Therefore, beings must be acting under the authority and at the will of an Omnipotent and All-knowing One. The relation between things and events is not causal. It is not horizontal but vertical. There is order in the universe but this order cannot be reduced to causal relations between things themselves. In other words, the regularities in the behaviour of things is not the result of causal laws. Indeed, the order in the universe does neither necessitate nor indicate the existence of such laws; it has been mistaken for causal laws. Causes are created; they have no inherent qualities that allows them to continue the order in the universe. There is uniformity in the creation but it is not exactly predictable because there is nothing that requires it to be as it is. The creation is uniform just because God willed so. Moreover, there is nothing in creation that necessitates that God should create this way and not another. ("He has the power to will anything!" See Qur'?n 46: 33).31 We see orderly activity. This activity cannot proceed from causes. It is the manifestation of God's custom. It can only proceed from absolute truths such as absolute power, knowledge and mercy. We perceive these truths in the form of laws which may be called laws of truths. These laws of truths are not causal. They are vertical. They proceed from God's commands: from the command of "'Be!' and it is." It is through the requirements of the laws of truths that beings come into existence and are employed in numerous duties. The laws of truths should not be mistaken for the so-called 'laws of nature.' The latter cannot be identified as the commands of God as many philosophers have held. They have taken it for granted that a proposition could express a causal law of nature if it stated that events, or properties, of certain kinds were necessarily connected. They have interpreted this necessary</page><page sequence="24">266 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation connection as being identical with, or analogous to, the necessity with which the conclusion follows from the premises of a deductive argument ? as being, in short, a logical relation, and this has enabled them to reach the strange conclusion that causal laws could, at least in principle, be established independently of experience.32 For if the causal laws were purely logical truths, they should be discoverable by reason alone. The present use of the expression laws of nature in science carries traces of this conception of the laws of nature as being identified with the commands of God. They are attributed a kind of necessity. LAWS OF ABSOLUTE TRUTHS When we look a little more carefully a continual ordering strikes our eye. All things constantly change and interact with each other in an orderly and regular manner. That is to say, this order and balance are inherent in all things whether universal or particular. They encompass and comprehend all things together with their interconnection in such a way that the universe appears as an inseparable whole. Certainly, if we look consciously around us we realise that all things and events are interrelated. All things are interdependent and inseparable parts of this universe. This interdependence and unity are most evident in living beings. No living being in this universe is self-sufficient. They all need water, air, sun, food, etc. In fact this is true for everything. All the kingdoms interact upon one another continuously. Vegetation, for instance, binds the sky to the earth by absorbing rain that falls from the clouds, using it and then evaporating the same rain from its leaves into the sky. Also vegetation quickens and conserves the atmosphere by inhaling excess carbon dioxide and exhaling vital oxygen. Trees, for example, hunt with their roots for water and minerals. And with their leaves, they look for sunshine to cool their food. Then they offer them to men and animals. And indeed, when we look to the beginning and end of all things, we see, particularly inanimate beings, that their origins are such that it is as if their seeds and eggs contain all the systems and members of those beings, each in the form of an index. And again, their fruits and results are such that the meanings of those beings are concentrated in them; they bequeath their life histories to them. It is as if their seeds and eggs are collections of the principles according to which they are formed. And their fruits and results are a sort of index of those principles. Tiny particulars are the fruits, seeds and like the miniature specimen of universals. From this point of view, to use Bediuzzaman's simile, we can say that the universe is like a tree. So each tree may be likened to the universe. We can take a tree as a miniature example of the universe in order to demonstrate a universal truth: that through the assistance of unity, all things are as easy as one thing. A tree may have thousands of fruits and each fruit hundreds of seeds. All the fruits and seeds are shaped and formed at the same</page><page sequence="25">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 267 time, in the same fashion and through one law. Indeed the law of a tree's formation is present in every part of the tree, within every fruit and seed. They are not obstacles to one another. The whole tree is formed through it. Let us take as an illustration a matter about which none of us has the slightest doubt. Although the sun is a particular and a single individual, it becomes like a universal by means of shining objects. Its image is reflected in all of them according to their capacity. No matter how big the number of mirrors exposed to it, the sun's reflection will be found in each one of them without being divided. One thing cannot be an obstacle to another. While its reflection is present everywhere, the sun is still up there in its place. Thus through the facility and assistance of unity, the inanimate and material sun, which is a single individual, can display universal activity in innumerable places. So, too, it may be said that although that law is not in any part of the tree, it is present in all of them without being radiated or fragmented. For that law is not of the same kind as material light. It is not radiated like light. It leaves no trace in the places it goes. It is as if that law has as many eyes and ears as there are fruits, seeds, and cells of that tree. Rather, each part of the tree is like a centre of the 'senses' of that law. They don't form a barrier; they are each like a means of facilitating the flowing of that law. It is for this reason that thousands of fruits come into existence as easily as a single fruit. If each fruit was bound to a different centre and if all their vital necessities were sent to them separately, each fruit would be as difficult as the whole tree. For the elements necessary for the life of the whole tree would also be necessary for each fruit. Thus, like that tree, the universe displays and is the field of operation of that law of assistance of unity. In the same way that, as far as its meaning is concerned, a huge tree can be encapsuled in a seed, a world can also be contained within a single individual. And like a single individual, the whole world may be encompassed by one law. As is clear from observation, millions of events occur in millions of places without any intermediary, all at the same time. It is therefore necessary that one law can encompasses the whole universe together with all its parts like a single individual. It is through this assistance of unity, that all things are as simple and easy as one thing; and that each thing can be as valuable as all things as regards its art. If those things were not formed according to one law, then each thing would become as problematical as all things.33 However, a universal consisting of a multiplicity of individuals comes into existence ? in front of our eyes ? with the same ease as a single particular. They all come into existence suddenly and out of nothing34 with utmost ease and speed, with the greatest art. All these universal acts that are apparent in beings demonstrate that they proceed from a power that encompasses all things in all things. Thus demonstrating that they cannot be the acts of causes, which are material and are not all-encompassing. For that power, stars are as easy as atoms, the greatest as the smallest, a whole species as a single member of a species, spring as a flower, and a tree as easy as a seed.35</page><page sequence="26">268 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation Just as a single sun is reflected in innumerable mirrors, so too that comprehensive power is reflected in the mirror-like beings. Small and great are one for it and it makes no distinction between them. All things, particular and universal, are obedient to the law of that power and submissive to its workings. Nothing interferes with another. Many and few, all are the same for that infinite power for which nothing is difficult. It follows that fruits, flowers, trees and animals, that are extremely valuable and artistic despite their ubiquitousness and abundance, emerge and unfold swiftly and easily, in regular fashion. This systematic unfolding; that is, the opening up from a single simple substance of innumerable varied and separate forms, everywhere, at the same time and by a single all-comprehensive act, is an indication to an all comprehensive truth of opening and in this truth, the tip of a law of all comprehensive opening may be seen. All kinds of eggs and sperm, and varieties of seeds and grains, the essences of which are as though the same with regard to their matter,36 become the source of innumerable different beings. Certainly this act of the unfolding of forms, that is the giving of well ordered and all different forms to everything, as well as a particular shape that is appropriate and beneficial to its life, demonstrates wisdom and attention contained within all-encompassing knowledge (". . . and not a leaf falls but He knows it. . ." Qur'?n 6: 59). All the instances of order, balance and measure point to that knowledge. All shapes, each measured in accordance with their purposes and benefits, indicate to that all-encompassing knowledge. Also, the fact that beings are attempting singly to maintain their functions in this constantly changing world, indicates a law of cooperation and assistance. This is a law of a truth that lies far beyond the capacities of those beings. For example, different elements hasten to help animate beings, the clouds, to help the vegetable kingdom; the vegetable kingdom to help the animal kingdom; the animal kingdom to help the human kingdom. Milk gushes from the breast to succour the infant. Animate beings are given their needs and sustenance in a manner that exceeds their capacities. All of these and numerous other examples of the truth of cooperation demonstrate a truth of all-encompassing mercy. All these acts and truths manifest in the universe are contained within each other. Each necessitates, proves and points to all the others. If those extended acts and comprehensive truths, each one of which is a proof of unity, are not the manifestation of one single truth, each necessarily becomes impossible in hundreds of respects. For example, let alone the self evident truths, like power, knowledge, cooperation and mercy, if only the act of giving of shape did not proceed from that single truth then the following becomes necessary. Either all things that are given well-ordered and different shapes, would have to have the ability to know and consider the order of the universe and would act accordingly, or the comprehensive truths of the universe would have to be present in each, or each would have to be present at a</page><page sequence="27">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 269 consultative meeting the size of the universe in order to measure and regulate benefits, and innumberable beings would have to be the members of that meeting; and so on. Innumerable nonsensical impossibilities like these would have to occur so that the universal act of giving of shapes that is seen everywhere, could exist. As for this, it is impossible to the number of existing beings. Because if it were the case, it would be necessary for the comprehensive truths of the universe, like infinite power and knowledge, to be attributed to each particle of every being. However, each has beneficial connections with all the others and duties that yield useful results. Each is in a position of both dominance and subjection to all the rest, both to each individually and to all of them generally. So each being, each particle rather, must of necessity be a point assigned to that motion which proceeds from the laws of comprehensive truths. Each renders its duties according to those laws. Thus, since beings perform important duties consciously and since they conform as though knowingly to the universal order in a way that infinitely exceeds their capacities and strength, they must be acting as mirrors to comprehensive truths, like infinite power and knowledge. They proclaim those truths through their impotence and deficiency. Indeed, if daylight and the reflections of the sun in all shining objects on the face of the earth are not attributed to the sun and they are not said to be the manifestation of the sun's reflection, then it is necessary for the actual sun to be present in all shining objects, so that that universal light could exist. Thus, power is also like a light; comprehensive opening is like a light; knowledge, cooperation and mercy are each like an encompassing light. Each of the truths of the universe is like an encompassing light. They are like the rays of a single truth of absolute unity. According to the vertical towh?d? approach, the laws at work in the universe are laws of truths; they are not causal. These truths are the attributes of God; they are absolute. What we call 'law' here, is the way things are created; it is the manifestation of these absolute truths (see Figure p. 270). To illustrate the difference between the causal approach and the towh?d? approach, we may take the falling of things as an example. According to the causal approach, things fall when they are released because they are acted upon by a force (gravity). Furthermore, it is inherent in things to behave this way. The force of gravity between particles is always attractive; it acts to draw them together. The reason is this: as the energy locked up in a particle is positive, giving it a positive mass, particles always try to gravitate towards each other. The gravitational interaction acts between all particles, but it is extremely weak. How is it the dominant cosmic force then? The answer lies in its universality. Because every particle of matter gravitates, and always attractively, gravity accumulates as more and more matter is aggregated. We feel gravity in daily life because every atom in the earth is pulling on us in concert. The effect of any single atom is neglibible, but when they all pull together the result is a</page><page sequence="28">270 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation substantial force. The gravitational force, thus, is thought to be an essential and intrinsic property of matter. Gravity, however, can be established only empirically. That is, we observe that there is attraction between things but from this fact we cannot deduce that matter possesses such a property.37 No one can prove that it is in the intrinsic nature of inanimate matter to attract. Rather, the fact that things fall, i.e., the fact that there is 'attraction' in the universe points to a law of Self Subsistence (qayy?miyyah) through which creation subsists. Indeed, how can things (e.g. particles), which have nothing in their nature that can cause them to endure over time, be the source of gravity? We see that the universe is held together; the planets revolve around the sun, the stars are bound to the galaxy. We understand that this universal activity cannot be the work of inanimate matter. Lifeless particles that are devoid of consciousness have neither the knowledge nor the power to exercise any force, let alone gravity. Particles cannot recognize and respond to other particles, and display collective behaviour. They cannot take pity on us and decide to keep the universe going on. Rather, this attractive force that we observe in the universe is the manifestation of qayy?miyyah, of power, knowledge and mercy.</page><page sequence="29">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 271 By performing duties far exceeding their capacities, tiny particles of matter glorify their Creator. They proclaim that their Creator creates all things and gives them perpetuation and continuance within order and balance, entrusting each of them with a duty by merely commanding them to be and they are. (\ . . When He wills a thing to be. He but says unto it, 'Be' and it is." Qur'?n 36:82). When, for example, an object is released it does not fall by itself, nor can the unconscious earth pull it. Rather the falling object is created anew each moment according to a law of qayy?miyyah and a law of mercy. It is God, the Self-Subsistent and Merciful, Who creates this succession of events. Muslim scholars like al-Ash'arl, al-Ghaz?l? and al-B?qill?n? are all agreed on this point. In fact all the four forces (gravity, electromagnetism, the weak and the strong forces) are all the manifestation of qayy?miyyah (self-subsistence), mercy and indeed of all the truths. The existence and perpetuation of the heavenly bodies is also tied to the law of self-subsistence (qayy?miyyah). If the Self Subsistent One were to withdraw His command for a moment, billions of galaxies and indeed everything in the universe would crash into nothingness, because created things do not possess in themselves anything that can help them perpetuate their existence. ("Verily, it is God [alone] Who upholds the celestial bodies and the earth, lest they deviate ? for if they should ever deviate, there is none that could uphold them after He will have ceased to do so." Qur'?n 35: 41).38 A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION The general principles of science such as causation and the reign of causal laws depend upon the inductive principle. Induction is used to justify inferences from what has been examined to what has not been examined. All arguments which, on the basis of experience, argue as to the future or the inexperienced parts of the past or the present, assume the validity of the inductive principle. Hence the inductive principle cannot be proved by using experience without begging the question. It cannot be proved rationally because causal relations are not necessary. This situation made B. Russell say: "We must either accept the inductive principle on the ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our expectation about the future. If the principle is unsound, we have no reason to expect the sun to rise tomorrow, to expect bread to be more nourishing than a stone. . ,"39 In this created world, there is nothing that guarantees that "the sun will rise tomorrow" for instance. We have no reason to feel sure that the sun would rise. But do we need to be certain that the sun will rise tomorrow? Let us find out first why we need to ask questions like: "Will the sun rise tomorrow?" Obviously, it is because the benefits attached to the sun's rising are vital for us. In other words, we are not concerned with the rising of the sun in itself, but for its benefits such as heat and energy. The sun does not have the</page><page sequence="30">272 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation ability to think and plan such purposeful benefits. It has neither the knowledge nor the power to do so. The rising of the sun has an indicative meaning. It indicates something other than itself. Its useful duties and vital benefits are not inherent to it; they can only proceed from infinite power, knowledge, mercy . . . Thus the rising of the such here and now together with its duties and benefits point to that power, knowledge and mercy. Indeed, ordering, regulating and the pursuit of certain purposes with a view to certain benefits, can only occur through knowledge, power and mercy. Certainly, the wise regularity and varied ordering that ensure us of various benefits, prove that the sun, and indeed all beings, are obedient to the laws of truths. If this is understood, the problem changes. We no longer need to know whether the sun will rise tomorrow or not. What we really need to know is: "Are absolute power, knowledge and mercy present now?" If they are not present, it becomes plain that not only we have no ground whatsoever for expecting the sun to rise tomorrow, but also for expecting anything to exist at anytime. For without those essential truths, neither the sun nor its rising, nor anything at all can exist. Moreover, since beings exist and the sun rises, they must be the products of the essential truths. For a being, however small it is and however short and limited its life is, can only proceed from these infinite truths. If these truths were withdrawn, even for a moment, everything would cease to exist. Therefore, even a sparkle of existence is sufficient proof of the necessity of these truths. There is no need to refer to the past. Each fresh event here and now is a proof of these truths. Now, since those truths are absolute and necessary they will therefore be present not only now but tomorrow and forever. Thus we need to be sure, not of the contingent sunrise of tomorrow, but of the necessity of the laws of absolute truths to which we owe everything. As long as the laws of truths are there, there is nothing to worry about. The sun may not rise tomorrow, the whole world may collapse, yet this is not important. For we need neither the sun, nor its rising, nor any other created thing (causes). They are all transient and contingent. They neither know nor understand our needs. Even if they did, they do not have the power to help us. We need God. We need His laws of absolute truths. Who other than the All-Compassionate One, Whose power and mercy are infinite,40 can hear and help us now, tomorrow and forever? The natural laws? Scientific achievements and discoveries? No. According to this vertical tawhldl approach, things and causes are related to each other through their Creator and not through causal relations. It rejects the causal scientific approach as fictitious and false. It makes it clear that the problem of induction is not inherent in creation. It is a corollary of the causal approach. The so-called problem of induction is the inevitable consequence of the claim that science produces knowledge of the unobserved. Knowledge of the unobserved can be established only if nature is uniform. However, it is impossible to convincingly show, either a priori or a posteriori, that nature is</page><page sequence="31">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 273 uniform, prior to a justification of induction. As it is impossible to justify induction, it follows that 'scientific knowledge' is logically unjustifiable. In other words, there is no logical reason for necessarily preferring scientific statements to any other cognitive claims. The problem with the scientific method does not lie in induction as a process of reasoning, but in its being causal and thus horizontal. Because the scientific method is causal, it uses 'horizontal induction' i.e., the inference from an instance or repeated instances of some conjunction of characteristics that the conjunction obtains universality. This kind of 'horizontal induction' cannot be justified. Moreover, the premises of such inference are false because they are based on causation, which is invalid and absurd. They therefore cannot yield true conclusions. Popper notes that scientific statements are improvable and in principle disprovable as well. By disproving causation, we have demonstrated that scientific knowledge is only a conjecture (zanri). Science cannot admit the fact that it cannot legitimately lay claim to knowledge because if it did, there would remain no reason for doing science. Moreover, science would not be able to assume a superior position over its potential rival, namely Revelation. In the tawh?d? approach such a problem does not arise. The vertical tawh?d? approach does not need to prove the uniformity of nature because it is not concerned with establishing knowledge of the unobserved but with establishing the existence of the absolute truths. To do so, it does not have recourse to 'horizontal induction' but to 'vertical two-step induction.' Every single event here and now is a proof of the absolute truths. Since everything proceed from the laws of truths and since those laws are necessary, we don't need to 'forgo our expectations about the future', as Russell says. We only need to review our expectations about the future. We don't need to be sure that the sun will rise tomorrow; we need to be sure that the power and mercy which the rising of the sun points to are necessarily existent, eternal and absolute. The vertical tawh?d? approach is, thus, the method best suited to fulfil the knowledge-extending function. The strategy we have followed in establishing this conclusion may be formulated as follows. ?produces-* VJ) horizontal induction All A's produce 's Horizontal Causal Approach Vertical Tawhidi Approach</page><page sequence="32">274 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation We have examined two possibilities: that causes produce the effects and that causes together with the effects are created through the power of an Omnipotent and Absolute One. Since reason can find no way apart from these two,41 by proving the first one to be impossible, invalid and absurd, the second way i.e., the way of God's unity, has necessarily and self-evidently been proved true. That is, we have demonstrated the truth of the second way i.e., the way of God's unity deductively. Besides, we have demonstrated that the vertical tawhldl approach, which is based on God's unity, yields knowledge through 'vertical two-step induction' and thus dissolves the problem of induction. It is, therefore, the best suited method to produce knowledge, the knowledge of God. Both the intellect and the heart confirm this knowledge. Science is obsessed with the idea that the only way to describe the natural world is in terms of numbers. Much of what is of central value to man, however, is not normally expressed in terms of equations and natural laws. For example, we do not express our reaction to a beautiful view in terms of numbers; we value it, in terms of its emotional, nervous and spiritual impact. Similarly, in our experience of compassion, surely one of the central qualities of our human lives, we are simply moved and although the compassion may be the greater or the less we do not quantify the degree of movement. For these most important things numbers are just inadequate: we feel, we do not measure. And yet, for the universe, science measures but does not feel. Certainly, our understanding of the universe cannot be complete just in terms of equations. For our experience of the world is not only intellectual, it is mainly emotional and sensorial. Death for instance is awesome. It preoccupies us all at one time or another. Science defines death as 'the permanent end of all functions of life in an organism or some of its cellular components.' This definition is not worth a straw for man's strong desire for eternity. It cannot satisfy his heart. Science cannot offer any solution to mankind's problems. In the tawhldl approach, which proceeds under the guidance of the Qur'an, both the heart and the intellect have a central place. They function in harmony to reach the knowledge*, the knowledge of God with all His Beautiful Names. Such knowledge is satisfactory both for the heart and for the intellect. We all know, for instance, that we will definitely die one day even though the 'natural laws' may afford no evidence for it as we can have no direct experience of our own deaths.42 None of us has the slightest doubt that we will die but we still organize our lives as if we are going to live forever. Indeed, transient things cannot be the object of attachment for the heart, which yearns for eternity. This is why we fancy things to be somehow immortal in order to be able to love them. We love life as though it was eternal. But at the same time we know it is transient. What does this mean? Is there any way out of this paradoxical situation between the intellect and the heart? The intellect sees that everything dies and passes away and concludes that death is the end of life. However, the heart, which strongly desires immortality, does not love anything transient. For the heart, the intellect's conclusion that life ends with death, is unacceptable. Saying "I love not the</page><page sequence="33">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 275 things that go down" (see Qur'?n 6: 76) the heart urges the intellect to reassess this conclusion. As a result, the intellect looks at the creation again and understands that our contingent existence and lives point to the necessary existence of an Ever-Living One. In the same way, our deaths also point to the perpetuity of the life of that Ever-Living One. Indeed, the fact that after we die, other living beings like us will follow, demonstrates that the manifestation of life is continuously renewed according to His laws of perpetual life. The deaths of all beings, like their lives, point to the eternity of the life of the Ever-Living One. All lives continuously come into being through the manifestation of His eternal and necessary life. For instance, a seed dies and rots, while inside it, a shoot is coming into life. That is, it is passing from the particular life of a seed to the more universal life of a shoot. So too, although death apparently seems to be disintegration and extinction of life, in reality, it is an indication of His perpetual life. Our life in the mother's womb is like a seed. When it comes to an end we are born in this world. The end of our life in the womb is not extinction. It is the beginning of the more universal life of this world. Thus death also is not annihilation; it is not an end. The grave is a door opening onto the world of eternity and mercy. When the intellect realizes this truth, that is, when it finds the Eternal and Living One, the heart confirms it; it reaches satisfaction ("verily, in the remembrance of God hearts do find their rest". Qur'an 13:28) For now it can love the fleeting life of this wold as the manifestation of eternal life. When in this state, man understands that life and indeed all the beauty and perfection in being, which are the cause of love, are signs of the Eternal One's life, beauty and perfection, he will love all beings for God's sake. He will realize that his hearts's boundless capacity to love has been given to him so that he might direct it towards the Eternal and Beauteous Creator. If he misuses it and spends that love, which pertains to the True Object of Worship, on transitory beings, he will do wrong and suffer the punishment of his fault through the pain of separation. When we look upon the universe in this manner, it appears as a coherent and meaningful whole. There is a perfect harmony between man and the universe, for the Qur'an cures man of the wounds inflicted on him by the transience of the world, the ephemeral nature of things and delivers him from the darkness of delusion and fantasy. It disperses all the gloom and uncertainty of materialist philosophy. It does this by showing the world to be a guest-house of the Merciful One, and the beings in it to be officials acting under His commands and the manifestations of His Most Beautiful Names. We perceive the external world through our innumerable senses, feelings and faculties. Our sensory experience of the world is not limited to the five senses. Each of those innumerable feelings is a sort of measure that makes known to us the truths of the universe. If we realize this and look at the world accordingly, we will see what the universe is and what it is pointing to. We will understand that the essence of man is an encompassing index, a map, and like a comprehensive mirror for the truths of the universe. And when we obtain</page><page sequence="34">276 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation information about the universe, we will see that our heart (qalb) as well as our intellect confirm it.43 This knowledge will be meaningful, it will not be transformed into futility and ignorance. Otherwise, if we do not heed the heart we would have to live in a world of contradictions and meaninglessness, as Steven Weinberg once wrote. "The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless."44 Certainly, the very existence of science indicates that the world is the field of operation of the laws of absolute truths which can be discerned through the telescope of the senses. It is those meaningful truths that make the universe like a book. The human intellect has extracted the library of science from it. PRACTICAL OUTCOME Both rationalism (apriorism) and empiricism are based on determinism. They wrongly claim that causes and effects are related by rational laws or necessary causal laws, the so-called laws of nature. The natural laws, however, are not necessary because the relation between cause and effect is neither rational nor necessary. If there are no necessary laws, it means that there is no guarantee for the future. Anything can happen tomorrow. We all see order in the universe, but this is often interpreted as causation. Some philosophers, like Hume and Russell, however, understood that there is nothing in the nature of causes that necessitates the existence of effects. For example, uptil now "water gave life to plants," but nothing can be deduced about tomorrow. Water has no life; it has no quality with which to give life to plants. That is, there is no reason that makes it necessary for water to give life to plants. Russell says that there is no reason for the sun to rise tomorrow, it may not rise. There is no guarantee. However, it is important for one who does not heed revelation to make sure that the sun will rise tomorrow. For, such a person sees the sun as the source of life. As he is in need of it, he does not want it to vanish. Such a person has to believe in determinism. One who does not believe in God has to accept that somehow causes have the power to create the effect. But, if someone in this position realizes that determinism and causation are unfounded, he will have nothing left to hold on to; he will have to live in fear of what will happen in the future. For example, when Russell understood that the sun had no property in itself that could guarantee its rising and hence the continuation of life, he said: "Domestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We know that all these . . . expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead ..." He also added: "When we see what looks our best friend approaching us, we shall have no reason to suppose that his body is not inhabited by the mind of our worst enemy or of some total stranger. "45 What makes people say things like this is their attitude of worshipping causes. To worship causes is used here in the sense of attributing the power to create to causes, that is, to see causes as efficient. A person who thinks that</page><page sequence="35">Islamic Studies 35:3 (1996) 277 causes are effective in the creation of effects has to expect the effects from causes. He has to deify causes. Lacking consciousness and potency, however, can neither hear him nor answer him. ("Do [you really think that] they hear you when you invoke them. Or benefit you or do you harm?" Qur'?n 26: 73-74).40 Thus, he has to live in a world of uncertainty and meaninglessness. The fact that causation is unfounded constitutes a sourse of fear for those who don't heed revelation. On the contrary, it helps those who heed the revelation understand how causes and effects make their Creator known to them.47 Causes and their beneficial effects perform duties in harmony with the whole universe although they do not possess inherent properties. This is an important point for those who heed revelation. It means that both causes and effects are part of an order. The creation of a perfect effect from impotent causes clearly demonstrates that causes cannot make the effect. Moreover, whoever makes that effect within the universal order, can only be one who possesses the power, knowledge, will, mercy etc., to make the whole universe. When the cause is separated from the effect in this manner, i.e., when it is understood that causes can in no way create the effects, it becomes clear that causation is a myth. The causal approach is by no means the corollary of 'objective', scientific investigation. It is no more than a personal opinion, but an opinion that is irrational and nonsense. Revelation, on the other hand, informs us of the Creator's absolute power, knowledge, will, mercy and wisdom. There is no guarantee that the sun will rise tomorrow. But this does not frighten the believer. For the believer knows that the sun is not the source of life; it does not take pity on him; it does not send him light in the wisest proportion. The believer does not place his hope in the sun but in his Merciful. Omnipotent. Omniscient and Wise Creator. The sun may not rise tomorrow, but like today, tomorrow also the Creator remains Merciful and Omnipotent. Since He exists, everthing exists.48 CONCLUSION Modern materialistic science accepts causation as the foundation of all scientific explanation. It attributes to causes, which are nothing but created objects, an existence and inherent properties that are independent of God. By doing so, it virtually ascribes divinity to causes. Materialistic science tends to object to the belief in One Transcendental and Absolute Being but it is bound to accept endless gods-: causes. In this paper, we have demonstrated that science cannot legitimately lay claim to knowledge. The scientific method is causal; it uses 'horizontal induction', which cannot be logically justified. Moreover, we have proved that causation, which constitutes the basis of all scientific statements, is unfounded and absurd. We have also shown how the vertical tawh?d? approach uses 'vertical two-step induction,' a process in which the problem of induction dissolves. Then we have deduced that the vertical tawh?d? approach is the best suited to produce knowledge. This knowledge teaches man how to read the</page><page sequence="36">278 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation universe under the guidance of the Qur'?n; how beings testify to the existence and unity of their Maker and glorify Him. As long as science does not accept the guidance of revelation, it will be bound to search within the limits of the created world for the explanations of beings and phenomena and therefore to have recourse to causation. It will never understand that all causes and effects point beyond themselves to their Creator with all His Beautiful Names. It will never see the reality of creation. Such science cannot explain anything; it cannot produce true knowledge. True science is a science that produces knowledge and solves mankind's problems. Such science works hand in hand with revelation and proceeds under its guidance, not denying the aims of Revelation from God. Indeed, this science, which may be called 'Islamic science' serves those aims; it shows that everything has been created on purpose and with meaning. Islamic science, using the methods of the Qur'?n, transforms information obtained about the universe into knowledge of God and wisdom (hikmah). It teaches man how to open up in every created being a window, which looks out on God's Names and brings home knowledge of His existence and unity. For the highest degree of humanity is the knowledge of God contained within belief in God. And belief in God is the highest aim of creation and its most important result. In this way, the purpose of creation, which is the worship of God, is fulfilled. "And I have not created the jinn and men to any end other than that they may (know and) worship Me". (Qur'?n 51: 56). 'The deductive (also known as deductive nomoiogicai) explanations are called 'deductive' because the truth of the conclusion follows logically or deductively from the initial conditions (called I) and generalizations or laws (called L), e.g. 'The apple fell because (I) it was unsupported and (L) unsupported objects fall. Clearly the truth of this inference depends on the truth of the law: 'unsupported objects fall.' This law is a generalization of repeated instances; whenever an object was released and thrown, it fell. This form of generalization is known as induction. Thus in the deductive theory the conclusion is deduced from the law which is obtained by induction. Therefore although the so-called deductive theory makes use of deduction, it is ultimately based on induction. 2D.

However, it is also held that the motor cause consists of explaining the effect by showing that it is the result of a becoming, a process determined by a double principle, formal and material, i.e. it consists in saying owing to what form and to what matter the effect results from the process. 4. The final cause: Whatever acts, acts in view of an aim. Another principle is thus needed: the end. According to Aristotle one way to explain things and events and understand them is to explain them with their end i.e., to explain what they lead to, or what they can be used for, e.g. a walk contributes to health.

'The Qur'?n invites us to consider the creation: "Say; 'consider whatever there is in the heavens and on earth!"' (10:101). "Behold, then, [O man,] these signs of God's grace" (30:50). ,0The Qur'?n also invites us to ask questions in order to find who is the Creator: "Who is it that has created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water from the skies? . . . Who is it that has made the earth a fitting abode? . . . Who is it that creates in the first instance, and then brings it forth anew? ..." (27:60-64). "Is it you who create it ? or are We the Creator?" (56: 59), etc. "The Qur'?n repeatedly asks us to consider how beings are created: "Do, then, they never gaze at the clouds pregnant with water, [and observe] how they are created? and at the sky, how it is raised aloft? And at the mountains, how firmly they are reared? And at the earth, how it is spread out?" (88:17-20). Do they not look at the sky above them ? how We have built it and made it beautiful and free of all faults?" (50:5). "Do you not see how God has created seven heavens in full harmony with one another. . ." (71:15), etc. 12"Now those beings that some people invoke instead of God cannot create anything, since they themselves are created" (16:20). l3This may be one reason why the Qur'?n says: "Behold, God does not disdain to propound a parable of a gnat, or of something [even] less than that" (2:26). I4"lt is God who has created the heavens and the earth, and who sends down water from the sky and thereby brings forth |all manner] of fruits for your sustenance; and who has made ships subservient to you, so that they may sail through the sea at His behest; and has made the rivers subservient [to His laws, so that they be of use] to you; and has made the sun and the moon, both of them constant upon their courses, subservient |to His laws, so that they be of use] to you; and has made the night and the day subservient [to His laws, so that they be of use] to you" 14:32-33. See also 7:10; 16:14; 16:66-69; 30:46; 35:12; 80:24-32, etc. 15The concept couched in the term mu'jizah which is generally understood to mean miracle, is not the same as the concept miracle as interpreted and understood throughout the Western history. The word mu'jizah is an Islamic concept; it does not refer to 'a marvellous event attributed to a supernatural cause.' Here the word 'mu'jizah', which is derived from the Arabic root 'a-j-z, is not used in the Western sense of miracle. It is not used in the sense of miracles of the prophets. It is used in the sense that all causes are unable Cajiz) to make anything. In this sense, So all created beings and events are mu'jizah: they are inimitable; they put causes to impotence (i'j?z). For instance, every plant and every grass with its roots and tendrils soft as silk is a miracle of power and mercy. It penetrates and passes through hard stones and earth; saying: "In the name of God, in the name of the Compassionate One." It subjugates all things to itself. The spreading of a tree's branches in the sky: the unhindered diffusion of its roots in the midst of the hard stones and earth;</page><page sequence="38">280 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation is spontaneous generation beneath the earth; its delicate green leaves remaining moist for months, despite intense heat are all like saying. "Hardness and heat also act in accordance with divine command; the silken tendrils of the plant, each like the Staff of Moses, obey the command of God: "And, We said Moses, strike the rock with your staff" (Qur'?n 2:60) and cleave through the rock. Its paper-thin, delicate leaves, each like one of the limbs of Abraham: fire, be coolness and peace' (Qur'?n 21:69) in defiance of the flame-spitting heat." ""'And how many a living creature is there that takes no thought of its own sustenance, God provides for it as (He providesl for you ? since He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing" (Qur'? 29:60). ,7Note that the existence of causes is not denied. The point is this: there are causes, but they are created; they cannot create: "And We send down water from the skies, and thus We cause every noble kind [of life] to grow on earth. [All! this is God's creation; show Me, then what others than He may have created! Nay, but the evildoers are obviously in error!" (see 31:10-11). "Is, then, He who creates comparable to any (beingj that cannot create? Will you not then be think yourselves?" (Qur'?n 16:17). See also 6:95-102. '""Say: "If there were ? as some people assert ? deities side by side with Him., surely they would have to strive to find a way unto His rub?biyyah. Limitless is He in His glory, and sublimely, immeasurably exalted above anything that men may say! The seven heavens extols His limitless glory, and the earth, and what they contain, and there is not a single thing but extols His limitless glory and praise; but you [O men] fail to grasp the manner of their glorifying Him!. .?" (Qur'?n 17:24-44). See also 57:1; 13:13; 24:41; 59:1; 59:23; 61:1; 62:1, etc. I9"0 our Sustainer! You have not created this without meaning and purpose. Limitless are you in your glory! Keep us safe, then, from suffering through fire!" (Qur'?n 3:191). 20In his History of Western Philosophy, Russell says: "It is . . . important to discover whether there is any answer to Hume within the framework of a philosophy that is wholly or mainly empirical. If not, there is no intellectual difference between sanity and insanity. . . . Hume's scepticism rests entirely upon his rejection of the principle of induction. ... If this principle is not true, every attempt to arrive at general scientific laws from particular observations is fallacious, and Hume's scepticism is inescapable for an empiricist. The principle itself cannot, of course, without circularity, be inferred from observed uniformities, since it is required to justify any such inference. It must therefore be, or be deduced from, an independent principle not based upon experience" (p. 699). As such principle has not yet been discovered, scientifically established conclusions are in principle as irrational as beliefs for which there is no 'rational' basis at all! 21 "For, most of them follow nothing but conjecture: (and,! behold, conjecture can never be a substitute for truth. . ." (Qur'?n 10:36). "Now if you pay heed unto the majority of those Iwho live] on earth, they will but lead you astray from the path of God; they follow but conjectures, and they themselves do nothing but guess" (Qur'?n 6:116).

(Qur'?n 16:73). "Say; 'Have you ever considered those beings [and causes] to whom you ascribe a share in God's divinity, [and] whom you invoke beside god? Show me what it is that they have created on earth ? or do [you claim that] they have a share in [governing] the heavens?" . . . Nay, [the hope which] the evildoers hold out to one another (is) nothing but a delusion" (Qur'?n 35:40). "Say: 'Have you given thought to what it is that you invoke instead of god?

Researchers only discover the established order and abide by it. They do not bring about anything. Unfortunately, they claim ownership of their findings and never mention the Creator of the t&gt;rder. 2*See also Qur'?n 24:54. 2ylt is through the power of that connection and at the command of its Lord, that a germ, a microbe or a virus can despatch a robust man to the grave; a tiny seed can become the workshop for the production of a huge tree; an ant can demolish Pharaoh's palace, etc. 30The Qur'?n and the believers ascribe all creatures to One Maker. They attribute every matter directly to Him. this is a path that is so easy to take that it becomes necessary to follow it and it beckons us all. Yet, the people of philosophy and misguidance, who ascribe partners to God, attribute a single creature to innumerable causes. Their way is so beset with difficulties as to become impossible. "God set forth a parable; man belonging to many partners Jail of them| at variance with one another, and a man belonging wholly to one person; can these two be deemed equal as regards their condition? |Nay| all praise is due to God |alone|; but most of them do not understand this." (Qur'?n 39:29). n Before the advent of the quantum theory, which is regarded to be the very foundation of 'reality', the universe was regarded as a huge clockwork mechanism, its behaviour legislated in every detail by the unassailable logic of cause and effect embodied in Newton's laws of motion. But now scientists accept that on an atomic scale things are different. The quantum uncertainty ensures that you can't know everything about a particle all of the time. Classical physics is still valid for everyday phenomena just because approximation is possible. Two experiments never yield exactly the same quantitative results, because experimental conditions cannot be duplicated precisely, and external disturbances cannot be completely eliminated. However, external influences are very small; they cause very tiny errors which can be neglected. The uniqueness of events and things can easily be seen in everyday life. No two leaves, no two cats, no two men are quantitatively the same, but we can distinguish and recognize them by their qualitative properties. These qualitative features are recurrent even though they are never exactly the same in quantitative terms. This fact shows that the Creator is under no restrictions whatsoever; it points to His volition, will, and choice. Rending the veil of monotony and proclaiming that everything is in need of Him every moment for everything, and is obedient to His Lordship (rubdbiyyah), it turns the gazes of man from causes to the Producer of causes. 32This does not mean that the concept of causal laws of nature as conceived by the empiricists is acceptable. Like the metaphysicists, they base their theories on causation which is incompatible with tawhld. ""God sets forth a parable; a man who has for his masters several partners, [all of themj at variance with one another, and a man depending wholly on one person; can these two be deemed equal as regards their condition?" (Qur'?n 39:29). That is, to attribute well-ordered and well balanced being which have unity to the jumbled hands of innumerable, lifeless, ignorant, unconscious, blind and deaf natural causes is as unreasonable as accepting innumerable impossibilities all at once. 34It seems as though elements are used in the creation of a new being, however, they possess none of the properties that new being displays, a seed or the elements, for instance, do not possess any of the qualities of the fruit such as form, taste, smell, colour, etc. 35"[For HimJ the creation of you all and the resurrection of you all is but like (the creation and resurrection of] a single soul". . . (Qur'? 31:28). 36Indeed they are all compounds of the same elements; they are made of quarks and leptons. Materially they may be considered as the same, the difference between them lies in the way they are organised. 37In Einstein's theory, the general theory of relativity, gravity is not really a force, but a manifestation of the curvature, or warping, of spacetime; it is a field of geometrical distortion.</page><page sequence="40">282 YAMiNE/lnduction, Science and Causation Bodies are not 'forced* into curved orbits by gravity; they simply follow the easiest path through curved spacetime. Gravity is, however, still an inherent property of matter. 38"There is not a moving creature but He has grasp of its forelock" (Qur'?n 11:56). See also 22:65 and 30:25. 39Russell, History of Western Philosophy, op. dr., p. 38. '""'My mercy overspreads everything" (Qur'?n 7:156). 4,Since beings exist and since they are being continuously renewed, then it is clear that they are being made. The controversial point is "Who is the maker?" Many hypotheses have been put forward "beings from themselves," "beings are natural; nature necessitates them", etc. AH hypotheses that do not accept the Creator are hidden versions of "causes produce the effects." This is why we have grouped them into one 'way.' The second way is the way of God's unity. The Qur'?n states that there are two ways: "Have We not . . . shown him the two highways?" (Qur'?n 90:10). "O my companions in imprisonment! Which is more reasonable: [belief in the existence of numerous] lords, each of them different from the other ? or [in] the One God, who holds absolute sway over all that exists?" (Qur'?n 12:39). "God sets forth a parable: A man who has for his masters several partners, [all of them] at variance with one another, and a man depending wholly on one person; can these two be deemed equal as regards their condition?" (Qur'?n 39:29). 42According to the principle of induction, the more we live in this world, the more we should expect to live tomorrow. In other words, our probability of remaining in life increases with our age. However, we all know that the older we are, the nearer to death we will be! 43Throughout history, most philosophers and theologians asserted the necessary existence of a creator but only theoretically. It is easy for man to reach intellectually the conclusion that there must be a creator. However, this conclusion is not complete for it does not take into account man's innumerable feelings. To know theoretically that God exists, is not enough. One has to know Him with all His attributes and confirm these attributes through his intellect as well as all his heart. ("Have they, then, never journeyed about the earth, whereupon they would have hearts wherewith they might understand. . ." Qur'?n 22:46). If man realizes that whatever has been given to him is from God's grace, he will trust in Him, submit to Him and thank Him. If he loves things not for themselves but as favours proceeding from God's mercy, he will be grateful to God; his love for these favours will be transformed into love of God. A flower, for example, is a gift of mercy, it is so beautifully and perfectly made that we are compelled to look at it and love it. The flower is created in such a wonderful form that it is made to reflect the Beautiful Names of God. We have been given such an intellect and such a heart that we are caused to wonder, love and as though prostrate at those attributes such as Beauty, Mercy and Power. Our love for the flower will then be for the sake of its Maker. We will express our love in the form of "How beautifully it has been made." This love opens a way to the infinite beauty of God's Names because it transfers the eye from the beautiful flower to the beauty of the Divine Names. It opens a way for the heart to prostrate before God. Such a love is pleasurable. It is worship. "S. Weinberg. Les trois premi?res minutes de l'univers (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1978), p. 179.
