CHANCE Arizona State University Every once in a while a rare, synthetic work of scholarship appears that coaxes researchers out of their increasingly narrow specialties and urges them not to lose sight of larger is- sues. For Mesoamericanists, this is such a book. A study of Mesoamerican religion and cosmology, this work takes seriously what many of us pay lip service to but in practice often ignore: that for some purposes Meso- america can fruitfully be studied as one culture with one mythological tradition; and that a central core of religious symbolism has per- sisted in the region for a very long time. Draw- ing on secondary works in archeology, art his- tory, ethnohistory, folklore, ethnography, and literature, the Markmans argue that the mask is the central metaphor for the Mesoamerican concept of spiritual reality. The mask, whether carved in stone or worn by ritual dan- cers, not only symbolizes particular gods, an- imal companions, and spiritual states, but also stands for a particular relationship between the natural and the supernatural. Masks re- veal rather than disguise, and through them Mesoamericans communicate with their gods and express their own spiritual identities. The bulk of this study-ten chapters of it- is concerned with Mesoamerica prior to Span- ish contact. The authors follow the lead of Campbell and Eliade, viewing Mesoamerican religion as essentially shamanistic and based on the individual's ability to penetrate the barriers separating matter and spirit. This vi- sion of the cosmos is not populated by Euro- pean-style, independent "gods," but rather by "momentary manifestations" of an underly- ing spiritual force that "unfolds" into the world for specific ritual functions. It all began with the Olmecs, whose "were-jaguar" mo- tif-symbolic of rain, fertility, and high poli- tics-is singled out for special attention. Fol- lowing Covarrubias, the authors then discuss the rain gods of the Classic and Postclassic- Zapotec Cocijo, central Mexican Tlaloc, and Maya Chac-as modifications of the Olmec were-jaguar mask. Architectural and funerary masks are also seen as providing access from the mundane to the sacred and symbolizing the cyclical notion of time-in which there is no end to life, but only changing forms or transformation. Mesoamerican views of space and time receive three chapters, which stress the "obsession" with the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The last four chapters pick up the theme of postconquest syncretism, focusing on the tra- dition of the masked dance in 20th-century Mexican communities. The central Mexican Danza del Tigre is interpreted as a jaguar-re- lated fertility ritual, a modern expression of a tradition that dates back to Olmec times. The more thoroughly syncretic Yaqui and Mayo Pascola dance poses more of a challenge, but the Markmans conclude that the participants "are dancing to the same set of spiritual as- sumptions" (p. 190). The book concludes with a look at masks in the work of modern Mexi- can artists Rufino Tamayo and Francisco To- ledo, both Oaxacans of Zapotec parentage. While these men unite indigenous and Euro- pean conceptions in their art, they have suc- ceeded, the Markmans say, in communicating to the modern world the quintessential Me- soamerican celebration of fertility and the "art of transformation." While the basic arguments of this book are not entirely new, rarely-if ever-have they received such extensive treatment in Meso- american studies. Illustrations are ample, but not lavish, and the emphasis is properly on the text itself. Some readers will be uncomfortable with the characterization of a state-based, priestly religion as "shamanistic"-a view which conflates what are usually taken as con- ceptual opposites. Specialists will also quibble over details, but this book's breadth of synthe- sis and clarity of exposition make it a valuable work for students of Mesoamerican religion.</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL/CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 751 Mesoamericanists are well aware of the continuity of Indian society from pre-His- panic times to the present, and of the syncretic configurations that have characterized the de- velopment of many cultural domains. Unfor- tunately, few studies have appeared demon- strating the nature of survivals and the syn- cretic structure of contemporary magic and religious supernaturalism. Italo Signorini and Alessandro Lupo, from the Department of An- thropology at the University of Rome, have written a superb account of magico-religious supernaturalism and related phenomena in Santiago Yancuictlalpan, a Nahua-speaking community in the Sierra de Puebla, Mexico. Substantively and analytically, Signorini and Lupo's account, in my opinion, is the best in the anthropological literature. With delicate insight and detailed knowledge of the Nahua imago mundi, they analyze the ideational order of Santiaguefios, demonstrating specific links to the polytheistic past and the syncretic ma- trix that transformed some of them. The book is divided into four extended chapters. Chapter 1 is a brief introduction to the ethnography of Santiago Yancuictlalpan. Chapter 2 identifies the spiritual components of man with reference to the pre-Hispanic ide- ology of the Nahua. The various kinds of souls are ontologically defined and assessed in the contemporary setting. Chapter 3 deals with the afflictions of the soul and the interaction between spiritual and physical components as the main determinants of folk illnesses. The concepts of evil eye, evil wind, and several oth- ers are diagnostically analyzed. The last chap- ter is a compendium and discussion of a rather large corpus of therapeutic supplications, their domains of efficacy, and their intended effects. This is an analytically sophisticated and ethnohistorically rich book whose more salient themes may be summarized as follows. First, Signorini and Lupo accurately detail the sur- vival of a complex array of supernatural con- cepts and personages, many of the syncretic transformations they underwent in close inter- action with Catholicism and Spanish culture, and their contemporary functions in the ide- ational world of the Sierra de Puebla Nahua. The ideology and belief system of magic su- pernaturalism are exemplified as the realiza- tion of symbolic and sociophysical interac- tions in the contexts ofwitchcraft, sorcery, and curing. Second, the folk concepts of illness and health are analyzed in terms of natural and su- pernatural inputs, diagnostically positioned, but etiologically influenced by a traditional symbolic and ritual system. Symbolism is ap- propriately regarded as mediating between supernatural inputs and natural outcomes. Third, the most outstanding contribution of the book, at least for this reviewer, is the de- scription and analysis of the spiritual compo- sition of man in terms of various kinds of souls, and the roles they play in the discharge of so- cial and physical (curative) functions. It is rather astonishing to witness the survival of an aspect of the pre-Hispanic theological-teleo- logical system with such integrity after more than 450 years. Finally, anthropomorphic su- pernaturalism is insightfully examined: the various manifestations of the witch and sor- cerer are identified, their spheres of action de- limited, and their ontological and epistemo- logical constitutions established. Throughout the narrative, the imago mundi of the Nahua is seen in manifold domains of realization, giving coherence to a supernatural system that reg- ulates much of the life of the community. The only fault in this otherwise excellent study is one of omission, namely, that it lacks a systematic conclusion. The authors, given their experience in several areas of Meso- america, are in an enviable position to discuss magico-religious supernaturalism compara- tively. In every other respect, this is an ele- gant, substantively rewarding, and analyti- cally insightful book. It should be required reading for Mesoamericanists, and it is an ex- ample of how to engage in symbolic analysis without the obfuscation of hermeneutics. The book has been translated into Spanish (Uni- versidad Veracruzana, 1989), and I hope that it will soon appear in English.</page></plain_text>
