<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. Philip Hyatt, The Prophetic Criticism of Israelite Worship (The Golden- son Lecture 1963; Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College, 1963). Pp. 24. n.p. The long debated question of the prophetic attitude toward worship has been studied again and that with fruit. One may wonder why H. has put himself on the side of those who read the pertinent texts as meaning abolition of cult rather than its purification. But his analysis of the abuses which the prophets saw in cult may be admired by anyone. Several aspects of Israelite cult called forth the bitter criticism of some of the prophets. Israelite cult overstressed the activity of God in the past whereas the prophets insisted on man's present confrontation with God. Worship was conceived too mechanically in its operation so that the prophetic ideal of the national and individual meeting with God suffered. Worship was man-centered, taken up with his need and wishes, rather than God-centered. A people who conceived their sacrifices in so grossly an anthropomorphic way could not grasp the transcendent God whom the prophets proclaimed. Finally, the sanctuary failed to announce the moral demands of a sovereign God. The lecture concludes with a powerful application to the worship of modern man.
