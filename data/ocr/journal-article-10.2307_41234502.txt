<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME REFLECTIONS ON AESCHYLUS' AETNAE(AE)* As it is well-known, there are several contributions which deal with the questions raised by the little amount of evidence available on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae)1. Unfortunately, it is not the appearance of any new data that has prompted this article, but rather realizing that some points made by my predecessors need rectifying, where- as other interesting elements (not certainties yet, though) deserve wider appreciation. So my reflections will still be speculative, though perhaps more sensible and more respectful of likelihood. *) I wish to thank both Dr. M. L. West of All Souls College, Oxford, and the editor Prof. B. Manuwald for their helpful and acute criticism of this article. An ear- lier draft of this article was presented at the Graduate work-in-progress seminar, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in November 1999: many thanks to those present for their intelligent remarks. 1)1 shall leave undecided the form of the title, until I have argued in favour of one.

R Oxy. 2257 fr. 1 Before tackling any specific questions, it is worthwhile to di- late on this most important piece of evidence. As it is well-known, this is a fragment of a hypothesis, in all probability to our play, as the editor, E. Lobel2, suggested, and is unanimously agreed. Since Görschen3 gave very different diplomatic and articulated transcrip- tions of the fragment, especially in the first seven lines, so as to im- ply a lot more than Lobel, it struck me that no one so far had checked whether Görschen's proposals deserved serious atten- tion4. So I have inspected myself the fragment and ascertained that Lobel's transcriptions are correct, whereas those of 11.1-7 by Görschen (based on a photograph, by the way) have no more to do with the traces of ink on the papyrus than a flight of fancy. There are only few points I would disagree about with Lobel, or I would insist on more emphatically. At 1.4 I cannot see a high point after tau, but only a small trace above it. At the end of the same line, the traces, seen under the microscope, look compatible with TtpocYM-ocxcc. At 1.6 the traces after 9r|v are in fact compatible with ccc (provided these letters were somehow connected), and those after ек are compatible with Ъгк. At 1.7 the trace before ocÇe is compatible with ß; the traces after xpcoï are compatible with ocv, whereas anything like A,o (or similar, amounting to a mention of Sophocles' play Ťroilus) is definitely ruled out; then the final trac- es (seen under the microscope) can be reconciled with cocpOK^ - . At the beginning of 1.8 the trace is compatible with o. 2) The Oxyrhynchus Papyri, part XX (London 1952) 66-8. 3) F. С Görschen, Die Hypothesis zu Aischylos' Aitnaiai (P. Oxy.

Sophocles' The lovers of Achilles. I deem that this one was the only parallel drawn from outside Aeschylus, as I cannot read anything compatible with either Euripides (Görschen) or Troilus (Lobel). Then a detailed ac- count of scene-shifting in the play under consideration followed. Finally, I disagree with Lobel on account of the interpretation of 11.12-3. He takes jiexà ô' amòv L-upaKouoaai mi xà Xovnà [ ]ir|i oiocKepocívexai кхк. to mean '(and) after this (place) (the scene is) Syracuse and in particular the remainder of the play takes place in ...'. In other terms Kai та Xoiná would not introduce the last change of scene, but would specify where in Syracuse the final act was set. I think that this interpretation, followed by most scholars, puts a strain on the Greek, especially in view of the change of syn- tactical construction (from toponym in the nominative and elleip- sis of r' okt|vt| Kevrai, to та Xoinà [se. тоъ ораиостос] ôiarcepaíveTai with preposition and toponym in the dative)5. How 11.12-3 are interpreted has a bearing on the total number of scenes (either five or six) and of the scene-changes (either four or five). //. Dramatization 1. Time and place The play was set in the remote mythical past, as appears from the wording of fr. 6 R., a stichomythia between two characters or, possibly, between chorus-leader and character: A. tí ôtjt' en aircoîç övojia 6r|aovTai ßpoToi; B.

Cra. 396d-e, Demosth. 9.21.5, 21.106.5, 37.32.3, etc.</page><page sequence="4">290 Letizia Poli-Palladini Here the reference to the name which mortal men will use in fu- ture, as well as to present disposition about it on the part of Zeus, and the present tense for the 'return' of the Palici, do command no other interpretation than this one6. As we learn from the papyrus hypothesis, the spatial setting of our play changed five times. Given that scene change is rare in tra- gedy, and that those few extant instances (Eum., Soph. Ai.) exhibit a maximum of two shifts {Eum.), some scholars have supposed the play must have been a unique or, rather, an abnormal tragedy. In- deed, they go on to say, far from being a real and 'normal' tragedy, it must have been a mere celebrative play, devoid of dramatic unity and coherence, simply made up of six separate acts7. But this is in all likelihood a rash and unwarranted inference. The lack of a com- plete parallel for the dramatic device (Eumenides being only a par- tial one) does not prove in itself that it affected perversely the play, as though Aeschylus could not master his own resources and skills8. I need not mention that neither the structure of the seven pairs of speeches in Septem, nor the bold treatment of time in Agamemnon, nor the central commos in Choephori is completely paralleled. A more economical supposition seems to be that Aeschylus produced a proper tragedy by contriving and exploiting an unusual dramatic device. This entails taking the information provided by the hypo- thesis as confirming what we knew from other quarters, i. e. his dra- matic freedom, or even boldness, ingenuity, and variety9. Then, we may wonder what led Aeschylus to admit, or resort to, such a peculiarity. If we look at Eum. and at Soph. Ai., a reason- able guess is that the plot he had in mind involved moving from place to place on the part of a character (or more) and/or the chorus. (I wish to stress that I am thinking of a continuous and co- herent plot.) This sort of thing happens most easily if a character, 6) Here I agree with Grassi (n. 1 above [1956]) 208 - followed by Cataudel- la (n. 1 above) 391-2, Garzya (n. 1 above) 404-5, Basta Donzelli (п. 1 above) 87 - against Fraenkel (n. 1 above), who believes the play was wholly set in shortly-past historical times, and contained only an indirect report on the origin of the Palici. 7) Fraenkel (n. 1 above) 71, followed by most scholars; Taplin (n. 1 above) 416-8.

Di Bene- detto/E. Medda, La tragedia sulla scena (Torino 1997) 311.</page><page sequence="5">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 291 on the one hand, has to reach another place in order to bring his/her intentions to pass, or has to flee; and if the chorus, on the other hand, want either to seek or pursue him/her. Whether the chorus left the scene some or all the times the set- ting was going to shift, we cannot say. But their jnexácrcaaiç10, though paralleled {Eum. first change: 231-5; Soph. Ai. only change: 814-5), is by no means necessary, provided some sort of articula- tion in the overall structure, and verbal indication of the new set- ting are given {Eum. second change: 566)11. That the audience could be happy with a change of scene, either with or without exit of the chorus, is proved by Eumenides, so that no need arises for the notion of 'refocus' to be dragged in12. (It has even been main- tained13 that these frequent changes of scene were made easier and far from disturbing by the innovative equipment available in the new theatre of Syracuse, which included such appliances as some sort of orchestra pitch, and poles for quickly changing backcloths. Of course, this point depends on whether the play was performed in Syracuse: see below.) As to the settings mentioned in the hypothesis, the first, Aet- na, must be the mountain, since the dramatized action takes place, as we have seen, in remote times14. Also, it may be argued that by 10) The term цетаатаац x°P°û ls drawn from Poll. 4.108 B. mi r' uèv eia- oôoç тог) xopoû лароОос raA-evcai, т) Ôè ката xpeíav e^oôoç (bç náXiv eiaióvTcov цетаатаац, r' ôè цета xoL')xr'v eïooôoç етплароОос, r' ôè хгХгьхта e^oôoç acpoôoç. Clearly, the (хетаотаак; is considered not as a conventional movement, but as part of the plot. 11) Again, I find Taplin's misgivings ([n. 1 above] 416-7) excessive: surely Aeschylus did not feel obliged to comply with Taplin's "act-dividing sone rule". 12) As Taplin ([n. 1 above] 417), though hypothetically, does. That is, how- ever, an unuseful and confusing notion, which mingles different phenomena: (a) change of setting signalled only by words: e. g. Eum. 566; (b) attention being drawn on a so far neglected, though present, part of the scene (without any proper change of setting): e. g. Pers. 140-1, 648, 659-60, 685, 687, Ch. 561, 571; (c) the alleged mag- ical creation, as it were, only by means of words, of single items in the scene (un- paralleled, I think, in tragedy). See its fullest theorization in A. M. Dale, Seen and unseen on the Greek tragic stage, WS 69 (1956) 96-106. An interesting re- examination of the notion of refocus, with emphasis on the differences between tragic and comic practice, is provided by S. Scullion, Three Studies in Athenian Dramaturgy (Stuttgart/Leipzig 1994) 67-8. 13) by Cornato (n. 1 above) 6/, who tollows CAnti and L. rolacco about the theatre of Syracuse: see below. 14) Thus also Grassi (n. 1 above [1957]) 208, Cataudella (n. 1 above) 377, La Rosa (n. 1 above) 152, Garzya (n. 1 above) 404-5.</page><page sequence="6">292 Letizia Poli-Palladini a bare Arcvr| the grammarian must mean what was more obvious, i. e. the mountain, not the city15. The second, Xuthia, is a region nearby Leontini16, according to D.S. 5.8.2: eßocoita-oae Sè mi So-uGoç хщ rcepì toùç Aeovtivodç Xcopaç, лтц arc' èiceívoi) jié%pi той vív xpóvoi) 5o')0ía яроа- осуоргиетоа. I follow the suggestion17 that Xuthia was a %юра rather than a rcóXiç, as in Steph. Byz. s.v. HcruGíoc, KoXiq InceÀiocç, OíÀi- атос Tpíxcoi IiKeA-iKwv (= FGrHist 556 F 18), and that nóXiq may be a mistake on the part of Stephanus or his intermediate source, absent in Philistus, who may have mentioned Xuthia as a region. Given the toponym Xuthia it is very hard to resist connecting it with a hero Xuthus: for, even if it were a local pre-Greek name (which is far from proved), the Greeks could not but perceive the connection as most natural. It remains to be established which Xuthus was believed to have ruled over, or laid a claim on, that re- gion, which I shall try to do later on. Indeed it is possible that in Aeschylus' play the setting Xuthia entailed mentioning or bringing on stage its eponym. The third setting is again Aetna, i. e. the mountain, not the newly founded city18, as the wording of the hypothesis (1.10 naXiv) makes clear beyond any possible doubt. The idea19 that náXiv should here mean 'in its turn', i. e. a different location in spite of identity of name with a previous location, is untenable20. Then, the following settings there mentioned are Leontini, the fourth; Syracuse, the fifth; and finally its suburb Temenite, provid- 15) I owe this point to Prof. B. Manuwald. 16) For an attempt at localization see La Rosa (n. 1 above) 157-64, although not every one will be persuaded by his contention that Xuthia was the original pre- Greek seat of the Palici cult, and must be identified with a place where findings from the early bronze-age show considerable Italic influence, like Metapiccola or Moli- no della Badia. (Yet, Basta Donzelli [n. 1 above] 90 accepts that Xuthia may be a pre-Greek toponym.) 17) By K.Ziegler, Xuthia, RE IX A.2 (1967) 2156. So does Basta Donzelli (п. 1 above) 92, who, moreover, finds it to have provided a suitable birthplace for the Palici. 18) Here I disagree with the great majority or my predecessors. 19) Garzya (n. 1 above) 406. 20) The nuance of meaning 'in turn', which is brought forward by an oppo- sition implied in the context, sometimes occurs both in poetry (see e. g. Soph. El. 371, 1436, ОТ 619) and in prose (see the instances in LSJ, s. v., III). But our passage has a repetition of Aitvt| instead of an opposition; and our hypothesis is written in plain common prose language, as usually exegetical literature is.</page><page sequence="7">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 293 ed Pfeiffer's restoration (registered by Lobel) hits the mark21. Ad- mittedly, the latter places belonged to human contemporary, or relatively shortly past, history, as they were Greek colonies. That is why one may be tempted to see in them historical settings, in time as well22. But we saw that fr. 6 R. is set in the heroic time, which is also likely to have been the case for the scene set in Xuthia. If we take scenes 4-6 as set in historical times, we should accept a huge temporal shift within one single tragedy, which is not only unparalleled, but also unlikely to have yielded any good drama- tic effect. And, what is even more, it is difficult to imagine how Aeschylus could bring on stage contemporary Leontini and Syra- cuse without introducing Gelon and Hiero, too, and how this could yield fine dramatic and celebrative results. In other terms, I deem it probable that Aeschylus pursued his celebrative task by means of a drama wholly set in the remote past of gods, nymphs and heroes (or their descendants), but at the same time developing aetiologically every suitable point. On dramatic consideration, therefore, we can confidently rule out that any scene in the play was set in the present of the Dinomenidae. So, what the grammar- ian meant by cLeontini' and 'Syracuse' must be the sites of the fu- ture cities of those names; this way of referring to places may have been prompted in him by the presence, in each of these scenes, of references to the cities that one day would be founded in those spots. Examples of such a compendious manner of referring to places of would-be-cities are, e.g., D.S. 4.79.1; 5.3.5,4.2, etc. If Pfeiffer's restoration is correct, the last and fifth scene change to the Temenite hill can be compared to the second and third settings in Eumenides, Athena's temple on the Acropolis and the Areopagus hill. Under the same assumption, and of the play be- ing performed in Syracuse, Aetnae(ae) and Eumenides would both have acts set nearby the very spot of the theatre23. It is tempting to suppose that Aeschylus was thus experimenting with a particular- ly effective way of dealing with aetiology, to which he would turn back in 458. It must have been clear to him that the coincidence (or 21) But Görschen (n. 3 above) 224-5 fills the lacuna differently: 11.13-4 mi та X,oi7ià [7cáÀ,(iv) èv Arcjvrji Ô(ia)7cepaívexai / oç (èaxi) тол(ос) [еясоуицос]. 22) So does almost every scholar. 23) Notoriously, the remains of the Greek theatre in Syracuse - i. e. of Hiero IPs theatre, under which the fifth-century theatre is believed to have stood, as per- haps also the older one - lie on the slopes of that hill.</page><page sequence="8">294 Letizia Poli-Palladini quasi-coincidence) of dramatized space and real space could bridge over the huge temporal distance between the dramatized events and their present counterpart, and hence emphasize the connec- tions between the two spheres, the fact that the one had its roots in the other. It is remarkable that scenes 1 -4 implied two different settings alternating twice, which considerably moderates the spatial varie- ty. Mount Aetna providing a setting twice - superficially, a mere consequence of the dramatized plot - gives us a clue to how Aes- chylus was attuned to his patron's ideological and propagandistic demands. For in Pi. P. 1.29-32 the rationale of naming the city 'Aetna' is honouring Zeus of mount Aetna, rather than the moun- tain alone. The cult of Zeus Aetnaeus had already been an impor- tant one (see mentions of him without connection with the city: Pi. O. 4.6-7; 6.96; N. 1.6), when Hiero decided to give it even greater impulse by naming the new city 'Aetna', and making it the first cult there24. Since Pi. P. 1 .29-32 in all probability reflects a corner-stone in the Aetna-related propaganda, according to the explicit wish of Hiero, it is fair to suppose that in Aetnae(ae) too the aetiological sequence implied that Zeus of mount Aetna decreed the founda- tion of a name-sake city in honour of himself and connected inci- dents (cult-place, love affair with Thalia consummated on the mount). Next, we still have to consider two more places mentioned outside the papyrus hypothesis by witnesses to our play. The first is the river Symaethus - which flows partly around mount Aetna, and partly halfway between the regions of Catane-Aetna and of Leontini - given by Macrobius (in his tale of the Palici functioning as an introduction to the quotation [fr. 6] from Aetn.) as the loca- tion of Thalia sinking into the earth after being seduced by Zeus25. From the following of Macrobius' narrative it would appear that it was in the same spot that the Palici, once born, were to emerge from under the earth. It is possible that this geographical detail be- longed to our play, even if Thalia was abducted and seduced on mount Aetna, if after the event she fled southwards, to the region 24) See E.Ciaceri, Culti e miti nella storia dell'antica Sicilia (Catania 1911) 145-6, A.B.Cook, Zeus (Cambridge 1925) II.2, 908-9. 25) Macr.

Eqs.</page><page sequence="9">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 295 of would-be-Leontini. But in this case its omission in the hypo- thesis must be reckoned with, perhaps by supposing it to have been mentioned only indirectly. Alternatively, the detail of river Symae- thus may have come to Macrobius from a source on the Palici oth- er than Aeschylus26. Secondly, in a passage from Ioannes Lydus (de mens. 4.154 = Aeschyl. fr. 1 1 R.) Aeschylus is said to have mentioned in this play a Kpovicc лоАлс in Sicily, as founded and ruled over by Cronus, which corresponded to the contemporary 'lepa nóXiq27. In the same passage other authors (Charax, Isigonus and Polemo) are men- tioned for the same reasons, and those are known to have taken an interest in Sicily and/or the Palici cult. The connection between a former city of Cronus and a 'Holy City', possibly sacred to the Pa- lici, is not clear. At any rate, Cronus' actual founding and ruling over that city must have been only a matter of narration in Aet- nae(ae), because the main events in the plot took place in the age of his son Zeus. A connection of this Cronia with the would-be area of the Palici, i. e. the area of would-be-Leontini, is also made more plausible by another piece of evidence. P. Oxy. 2637 fr. l(a)28 is a commentary on two odes (scolia or encomia by Simonides, it has been suggested29), the first of which developed a Sicilian myth, ap- parently about a uenator gloriosus. At 11. 3-4 the poetical phrase, which must have occurred in the ode, ai Kpovíoo) 7rru%ou is ex- plained by K]póviov ev Aeovxivoic. Whereas this place named after Cronus, and set in the area of Leontini, has nothing to do with the other Cronium, where Dionysius the Elder was defeated by the Carthaginians in 383 B.C. (D.S. 15.16.3: the place has not been identified yet, but it must be in western Sicily; for after the battle the Carthaginians withdrew to Panormus, D.S. 15.16.4) nor with the Cronium named by Polyaen. 5.10.5 (and identified with Pizzo Cannita): a connection with the city of Cronia, mentioned by Aes- 26) This is certainly true of the remainder of his tale on the Delli (Sat. 5.19.19). Moreover, he may have been made keen on the Symaethus by its occurring in the Aeneid passage (9.581-5), which he has set out to comment upon. 27) The emendation 'Iuépa (Bloch) is rightly rejected by Radt in view of the apposition rcóÀiç. 28) Edited by E.Lobel, lhe Oxyrhynchus Papyri, part XXX11 (London 1967) 139. 29) M.Treu, Sizilische Mythologie bei Simonides (P.

However, the ode seems to speak about a mere open area, perhaps a vale or a hilly place, while the play mentioned a city. Although we know that in Sicily many a hill was named after Cronus (D. S. 3.61.3), it is reasonable to guess that Cro- nia city was mentioned in connection with the Palici (see the later name of 'Holy City'), and hence possibly in an act set in the area of would-be-Leontini, either the second or the fourth. All in all, it is conceivable that most or all of the settings of- fered a good chance to include some aetiological hints within the self-sufficient and continuous action, and it is likely that such hints were aimed at giving Hiero 's rule and policy a mythological dig- nity, and, by implication, justification. 2. Myth and plot Surely, when Hiero commissioned Aeschylus to compose a play in celebration of Aetna, and presumably made clear to him the propagandistic gist of the event, the question as to what to drama- tize occurred to the playwright. No ready-to-use myth was available on the remote and divine antecedents of Hiero 's policy concerning the city of Aetna. It had to be invented more or less ex novo. To be more exact, there had been around some or several stories on Sicily's remote past, aimed at providing the Greek domi- nation with an antecedent and some sort of justification. This im- portant function of myth-making and developing genealogies was prominent throughout the archaic period, both in the mainland (especially with the saga of the Heraclids), and in colonies, where it lasted longer31. See the great number of myths on eponyms of cities (or, less frequently, areas) which in historical times were Greek colonies: e. g. Siris (Timaeus FGrHist 566 F 52, Eur. fr. 496 N.2 Melan. capt); Messapus (Str. 9.2.13 [С 405], Steph. Byz. s.v. Meaodrciov, Serv. ad Verg. Aen. 8.9); Metapontus or Metabus (Steph. Byz. s.v.

Other eponyms could be closer in time to the actual Greek foundation of the colonies to which they were attached: Syracuse after either Archias' wife, or his daughters Syra and Cosse (Schol. marg. ad Call. Ait. II fr. 43.28-30 Pf.). Most of these tales are rivalled by alternative explanations, based e. g. on rivers (Siris, according to Archilochus, fr. 22 W.). Or see the tale of Athena, Artemis and Core receiving each a portion of Sicily's ter- ritory (D. S. 5.3). Or of Core's abduction by Pluton taking place in Sicily (D. S. 5.4-5). The localization in Sicily of the settings of Od. 9-10, which had been left vague by Homer, took place in the ar- chaic colonial period, and was taken for granted in the classical age (see Th. 3.88.1, 6.2.1, Eur. Cycl. 20-2, cf. later Theocr. 11.47-8). This must have been the starting point of a group of variant, or even conflicting stories all aimed at taking advantage of the Odys- siac Aeolus (Od. 10.1-12, particularly 2 AïoÀoç Чллотаопс)32. A story (D.S. 5.7-8, probably from Timaeus [566 F 164: see Jacoby ad I.]33) went that the Odyssiac Aeolus ruled over his name- sake islands, having married Liparus' daughter Cyane. At his death, his six sons became masters of various areas of Sicily and Ita- ly: Pheraemon and Androcles of the northern coast of Sicily; Xu- thus of the region of Leontini; Agathyrnus of the region and city which were then called after his name; Astyochus of Lipara; Iocas- tus of Rhegium (a tradition recalled by Call. fr. 618 Pf. Triyiov аати XiKWV 'Iomaxeco AioAiôao, and drawn on Timaeus, too, according to Pfeiffer ad loc). Note that the native people willingly deferred power to them both because they were in discord, and because their father had gained a reputation for justice and virtue. Their descendants ruled for several generations, until they were over- thrown. It is needless to emphasize how useful a charter was pro- vided by such a story for Greek domination34. An advantage of this 32) Cf. J. Bérard, La colonisation grecque de l'Italie méridionale et de la Sicile dans l'antiquité. Histoire et légende (Paris 21957) 315-6. 33) But this does not necessarily mean that the story is recent, as Basta Don- zelli (п. 1 above) 90 is inclined to think. In fact, the legend is at least as old as the fifth century B.C., when Iocastus is represented on coins from Rhegium, and the name of Pheraemon is on coins from Messana: see G.Vallet, Rhégion et Zancle (Paris 1958)91-4. 34) On its typical pattern see T. S. Brown, Timaeus of Tauromemum (Berke- ley/Los Angeles 1958) 59.</page><page sequence="12">298 Letizia Poli-Palladini story is its ethnic vagueness, which depends on the vagueness of Homer himself about the pedigree of this Aeolus and the localiza- tion of his islands. As in Homer, Aeolus is the son of Hippotes without further indication (D.S. 5.7.6). But in spite of all this vagueness, one may wonder why one of Aeolus' sons should be called Xuthus, and rule over Leontini of all places. One would sup- pose that in the first place the Chalcideans in the area of Leontini connected the latter with Xuthus the son of Hellen and father of Ion - not least because Xuthus was especially linked with Euboea (to two sons of his, Cothus and Aeclus, was credited the founda- tion respectively of Chalcis and Eretria)35. The story of the empire of the sons of the Odyssiac Aeolus reflects the broader horizon of Greek presence in Sicily and southern Italy quite apart from paro- chial disputes between Chalcideans and Dorians. It also witnesses the importance of Syracuse in the detail of Cyane. Another story (D. S. 4.67.2-6) makes of 'Aeolus the king of the Aeolian isles' a person of completely different lineage. The Ho- meric datum of 'Aeolus son of Hippotes' is retained but pushed a generation back so as to provide the grand-father of our Aeolus, and the intermediate link, through Mimas, with the best known Aeolus the son of Hellen. Aeolus (III) and his brother Boeotus were both sons of Arne (in Diodorus; Melanippe in a variant of this story: e. g. Hyg. Fab. 186, Eur. Mel. capt.) and Poseidon; their con- ception caused their mother to be sent to Metapontium by her father. After several vicissitudes, Aeolus ended up with being the master of those islands which were then named after him, whereas Boeotus went back to continental Greece. It will not be my task to assess how this story came about, and to which demands it re- sponded. Let it suffice here to note its probably being posterior to the one narrated in D. S. 5.7-8. The link of Magna Graecia and the Aeolian Islands with Aeolia is far from clear, unless it was just meant as a counter-claim against a preceding and very specific one, maybe Dorian or Heraclid, since Aeolus was the son of Hellen and the brother no less of Xuthus (father of Ion) than of Dorus36. (It is 35) See M. L. West, The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women (Oxford 1985) 58. 36) The variant legend of Melanippe and Metapontus, used by Euripides in his Melanippe captiua, may have reflected Athenian strategic interest in the area of Metapontium: see L. Burelli, Euripide e l'Occidente, in: L. Burelli/E. Culasso Ga- staldi/G. Vanotti (n. 1 above) 129-67, especially 160-2. On the problems raised by</page><page sequence="13">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 299 in fact well-known that concurrent versions of a myth used to arise alongside conflicting claims over a territory37.) Making a step back to Aetnae(ae) scene two, if the eponym of Xuthia was there mentioned or brought on stage, we may wish to answer the question of his identity, (a) That he may have been the son of Hellen38 sounds dubious, because that would have amounted to re-asserting old Chalcidean claims over the territory of Leontini, which seems to be most unlikely within a drama com- missioned by such a patron as Hiero, who not only ruled over Le- ontini, but also pursued an openly pro-Dorian policy to the disad- vantage of the Chalcideans. (b) His being one with the Odyssiac Aeolus of the story in D. S. 5.7-8 is not impossible, but one would expect myths more specifically connected with Hiero 's policy, (с) A different story, and more to the point with Hiero, was reflected. Unfortunately nothing else is attested, so the answer to the ques- tion about Xuthus' identity in scene two must remain hypotheti- cal. Before developing my favourite hypothesis, let me review some facts. Syracuse had been founded by Archias, a Heraclid him- self from Corinth, and a member of the Bacchiad yévoç (Th. 6.3.2, [Plut.] Mor. 772d-3b). The like must have been true for most or all of the aristocrats joining his enterprise. Corinth was believed to have come to the Heraclids when Aletes, a son of the Heraclid Hip- potes, defeated and banned from it Sisyphus, a son of Aeolus. Dur- ing his exile and wanderings after murdering the soothsayer Car- nus in Naupactum (Paus. 3.13.3, [Apollod.] 2.8.3), the Heraclid Hippotes settled in Cnidus (cf. Tz. ad Lye. 1388)39. The Cnidian Pentathlus referred his descent back to the Heraclid Hippotes (D. S. 5.9.2). An interest in the Heraclid Hippotes during the ar- chaic age is witnessed by a fragment from the Hesiodic 'Greater Ehoeae' (fr. 252 M.-W.). this Metapontine legend in relation with Thessalo-Boeotian saga see Bérard (n. 32 above) 332-3. 37) See Malkin (n. 31 above [1994]) passim. 38) b. Mazzarino, 11 pensiero storico classico (Ban 1966) 1 555, considering Xuthia an Ionian territory par excellence, especially after Hiero 's deportations of Chalcideans from Naxus and Catane to Leontini. But, surely, stressing the Ionian claim to this territory would have weakened Hiero 's sway on it. 39) A similar pattern is lollowed in the story about llepolemus, the son ol Heracles: after killing Licymnius, he was banned from Argos; so he moved to Rhodes, where he founded Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus: Pi. O. 7.20-38, [Apollod.] 2.7.6,8.</page><page sequence="14">300 Letizia Poli-Palladini Now, it is conceivable that someone, either in Syracuse or among the Cnidians of the Aeolian Isles, identified their ancestor Hippotes the Heraclid with the Hippotes mentioned by Homer as father of Aeolus the master of winds. This identification would have altered the story told in D.S. 5.7-8 so as to provide an ante- cedent to Dorian domination in Sicily and Magna Graecia. For Syracuse this must be pure speculation. For the Cnidians of the Ae- olians the hypothesis is somewhat more solid. First it is striking that Diodorus should narrate in one and the same context of 'Ae- olian archaeology' both the story about the Odyssiac Aeolus the son of Hippotes, and the events of Pentathlus' attempt at coloniz- ation in the area of Lilybaeum, whose failure led the surviving Cnidians to settle in Lipara. His version of the latter event is re- markable for the detail that the few descendants of Aeolus (sc. the Odyssiac one) entreated the Cnidians to settle there, while Anti- ochus (FGrHist 555 F 1) reported that the Cnidians either found the isles desert or expelled the natives. One gets the impression that Timaeus' source not only represented Cnidian colonization of the Aeolians in a very rosy light, but also made of the colonists descen- dants of Aeolus, and hence kinsmen of the local inhabitants, by means of the common ancestor Hippotes (sc. the Heraclid). The identification of the Homeric Hippotes with the Heraclid Hip- potes will have been rejected by Timaeus, either on grounds of mythical chronology (since Odysseus, who fought at Troy like Tlepolemus, the son of Heracles, comes earlier than any Heraclid of the second and later generations, whereas Hippotes belongs to the third generation; see also the chronology which dated the Tro- jan War to 1194-84 B. C, and the return of the Heraclids to 1104 B. C: cf. FGrHist 244 [Apollod.] F 61-2), or of ideological impli- cations (supposing a similar version had been exploited by, say, Hiero). That the Cnidians might have wished to support their ter- ritorial claim by a charter myth is made conceivable by the parallel behaviour, positively attested, of Dorieus (Hdt. 5.43, D.S. 4.23.2- 3): he based his claim to rule over western Sicily on the tale that Heracles, his ancestor, had overcome in wrestling the Elymians' king Eryx. So one may hypothesize that scene two of Aetnae(ae) one way or another involved a Xuthus ruler of Xuthia and son of Aeolus, as in D.S. 5.7-8, and that as a grandchild of the Heraclid Hippotes; the scene would have thus asserted Dorian (and particularly Syra-</page><page sequence="15">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 301 cusan) claims over the territory of Leontini40. Admittedly, nothing more can be alleged in support of this speculation. Whatever the value of the above hypothesis, what we have seen so far are stories in the interest of the ruling Greeks in gener- al, which do not offer any clues to individuals. Yet, we possess two scraps of evidence which hint to a special interest taken by the Dinomenidae in the exploitation of such myths. (i) Most commonly the name of Gela was explained as derived from its river, and this called after the Sicel word for 'ice' (cf. Lat. gelu)41. A rare tradition, reported by Proxenus (FGrHist 703 F 4) and Hellanicus (FGrHist 4 F 199), derived it from a certain Gelon, son of Aetna42 and Hymarus (the latter name is likely to be cor- rupt)43. Another explanation was based on the 'laughing' (yeXá- octvTOç) of the would-be founder Antiphemus in Delphi (all three accounts in Steph. Byz. s.v. Fetax, and Schol. ad Th. 6.4.3 H.). The first tradition was the most widespread, and probably the true one. The last one sounds like a later embroidery. The second one is interesting because it points to the tyrant Gelon: for who else could encourage the rise of such a story44? The latter, whether simply orally circulated, or, rather, formalized by a poet45, is likely to have dealt with a remote Gelon, ruler of his namesake city, Gela, and an- 40) Thus also V.

Byz. cit.); or Maros, mount Maroneum personified, cf. Plin. NH 3.8.88 (Ciaceri [n. 24 above] 308). 44) The link is made also by Ciaceri (n. 24 above) 11. 45) If this story came about in a poem commissioned by Gelon, as I tend to believe, Callimachus' adoption of the fluvial etymology of Gela (1. 46), along with those of other Greek colonies of Sicily in Aet. 2 fr. 43 Pf ., could be accounted for as conscious departure from his predecessors, and deliberate preference accorded to less immediate, at least for a poet, but much more learned sources, such as histor- ians. It is noteworthy that Thucydides, too, had not even mentioned traditions like the present one (e. g. 6.4.3 xfji |ièv nóXei ano той ГеАлх лотацог) tovvouoc èyévexo).</page><page sequence="16">302 Letizia Poli-Palladini cestor of the fifth-century Gelon, in order to charter his right to rule over Gela, perhaps shortly after the time of his usurpation of power at the expense of Hippocrates' sons. But there seems to be more than justification of power. Very little is known of the descent of the Dinomenidae46. Gelon, Hiero, Thrasybulus and Polyzelus were the sons of Dinomenes (Schol. ad Pi. P. 1.112; Pi. P. 1.79; Bac- chyl. 3.7, 4.13, 5.35). One ancestor of theirs, Telines, had gained the hereditary hierophanty for the cult of the Goddesses (and presum- ably political prestige), as a reward for his mediator's offices dur- ing a case of civil discord in Gela, at an unknown date (Hdt. 7.153, Schol. ad Pi. O. 6.158a). A more remote ancestor, who came from the island of Telos, had taken part in the foundation of Gela (Hdt. ib.). At Herodotus' time the particulars of Gelon's pedigree were already forgotten. But this can hardly result solely from the decline of their rule as early as 466: for not even Pindar and Bacchylides magnify, or just mention, the genealogy of the Dinomenidae be- yond Dinomenes. In this respect, a comparison with the Emmeni- dae is most illuminating. Not only do we know that Thero de- scended from Telemachus, a founder of Acragas and a conspirator against Phalaris, through Emmenidas and Aenesidamus, Thero 's father; but also that he drew the whole genealogy back to Ther- sander the son of Polynices (cf. Pi. O. 2.43-7)47. One would think that it was impossible for the Dinomenidae to draw their genealo- gy back to one of the usual heroes, maybe because they had been a notoriously obscure or even low-status family up to Telines48. If that was the case, it would be easier to imagine Gelon sponsoring 46) On this topic I have much profited from J. P. Kesteman, Les ancêtres de Gélon, AC 39 (1970) 395-413. 47) See G. Lippold, Theron, RE V A (1934) 2447-51, especially 2447-8. 48) This seems to be implied in Herodotus' narrative (surely resting on a neg- atively biased source): note the unflattering description of Telines (7.153.4); Suager's spiteful implicit comparison between the pedigree of Spartan military leaders, i. e. kings, and Gelon - which in fact Gelon perceives as òveíÔT| and ')ßpia|j.aTa - (7.159- 160.1). It is usually inferred that the Dinomenidae were Geloan aristocrats from their hierophanty, Gelon's supreme command of the cavalry under Hippocrates, and their later life-style and policy. Yet, the hierophanty was acquired under excep- tional circumstances, according to Herodotus. Before commanding the cavalry, Gelon had been a trusted supporter of Hippocrates, one of his Ôopixpópoi (Hdt. 7.154.1), which does not speak in favour of Gelon belonging to an ancient aristo- cratic family. Nor Chromius (the trusted supporter of Hippocrates, then Gelon, and finally Hiero) was celebrated by Pindar (N. 1 and 9) for his pedigree. Contrast e. g. Pi. O. 6 with its wide celebration of Hagesias as an Iamid.</page><page sequence="17">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 303 a Sicilian genealogy for his family. Through a common pattern - the pattern which involves rule over an oversea territory in the re- mote past, then its end, and finally return of the ruling stock to that territory - Gelon could raise special claims over Sicilian territory. (ii) We know that somewhere Simonides (PMG 552) dealt with a dispute over Sicily between Hephaestus and Demeter (clear- ly moulded after the example of Athena and Poseidon contending for Attica); this was decided by Aetna. Again, it is sensible to sup- pose that the topic was developed in a poem commissioned by one of the Dinomenidae, either Gelon or Hiero49. It is a pity that our witness does not give more details on Aetna, whether she was a goddess, or a nymph and/or the daughter of a god. It is clear, how- ever, that the inclusion of this figure in a newly-created myth fea- turing Olympian gods had political implications. If Aetna herself, a more or less divine figure tightly bound to Sicily, had assigned possession of the island to one of the two contending Greek gods, the message again came across that Greek domination there was not a recent imposition from the outside. (Be that as it may, Aetna's importance in myths with political implications is proved by other genealogies of her, which may be later than the Dinomenidae: daughter of Uranus and Ge according to Alcimus50; of Oceanus [and mother to the Palici by Hephaestus] according to Silenus51; of Briareus [and sister of Sicanus] according to Demetrius of Calla- tis52.) The upshot of this discussion is, therefore, that a set of le- gends on supposedly remote antecedents of Greek rule over Sicily (and southern Italy) did in fact exist when Aeschylus was commis- sioned with Aetnae(ae). Moreover some myths had been devel- oped by poets, presumably working for the Dinomenidae, to the same purpose and/or to justify their tyranny. So it is not utterly ex- act to say that Aeschylus had to start working in a vacuum. But it 49) Simonides is usually thought to have worked only for Hiero, because he appears to have been his guest from 476 onwards. But nothing prevented him from accepting commissions from Gelon, or any other wealthy Siceliot, either by mail, as it were, or directly on such occasions as the games. On the problems raised by Simonides' Siceliot commissions see J. H. Molyneux, Simonides. A Historical Study (Wauconda 1992) 220-36. 50) FHG IV 296 fr. 2. 51) FGrHist 175 F 3, ар. Steph. Byz. s.v.

An unbiased reading of Macr. Sat. 5.19.15-9 suggests that the story of Zeus and Thalia, there given as the background to the Pa- lici fragment, belonged to the play as well55. Macrobius' introduc- tion to Aeschyl. fr. 6 (Sat. 5.19.24 Aeschyli tragoedia est, quae in- scribitur Aetna. In hac cum de Palieis loq и er e tur, sic ait: - ) does not prove that the story of the Palici was only reported, rather than directly dramatized: for Macrobius gives the impression that he knows no more of Aetnae(ae) than he found in his source and copied down56. So, although there is room for difference of opinions in reconstructing this play, no one can reasonably deny that the love-affair, its consequences for Thalia, the 'birth' of the Palici, could provide enough stuff for most of the drama. Compare Aeschylus' lost play Callisto, which is likely to have dramatized the love-affair between Zeus and the virgin (either nymph or mor- tal woman; in any case connected with Artemis) Callisto, and the consequences of it. The changes of setting in Aetnae(ae) are no hin- drance to this supposition. If the chorus was made up of nymphs of mount Aetna, Thalia's associates (either sisters or friends), they may have moved to other places seeking her, after Zeus had taken her away. Or she could flee in fear of Hera's reprisal. After she had been swallowed by the Earth, the search for her could continue; or the exact site of the 'birth' of the Palici might have been looked for. 53) Macr.

On the other hand, Fraenkel (n. 1 above) 63 implies the oppo- site when he maintains that the birth of the Palici was dealt with only indirectly and in the fourth scene. 56) I disagree with Fraenkel (n. 1 above) 63, 72 (followed by most scholars).</page><page sequence="19">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 305 We can be assured that in Aetnae(ae) the mother of the Palici was called Thalia57, not Aetna58, given the occurrence of that former name in direct connection with Aeschylus, and without mention of any alternative, in Macrobius (Sat. 5.19.18 nymph a Thalia compressi* louis grauida eqs.) and Stephanus of Byzantium (s.v. FlocÀiKTi, quoted above), plus the inscription 0АЛ1А in a vase- painting representing the abduction of the nymph (see below). If Aeschylus was the first to introduce a Thalia as a nymph of mount Aetna and daughter of Hephaestus, he might have been induced to take this step in order to leave Aetna other roles, perhaps those seen above (Aetna mother of Gelon, and arbitrator between Hephaes- tus and Demeter), which are likely to have been particularly dear to the Dinomenidae. It is a fair assumption that the plot included some other inci- dents and/or characters, especially in connection with settings 4-6. Indeed, the setting of Xuthia makes it attractive to imagine Xuthus, and possibly some of his brothers, featuring in the play. Yet, any further guess is pointless. What is important is to realize that the Palici story need not have been confined to the scene set in Leonti- ni just because their pond and sanctuary were actually located near that town (modern Lago Naftia, near Palagonia, halfway between Catania and Caltagirone)59. On the contrary, it is probable that at 57) A sensible name for a nymph, and that mother of two chthonic gods in- volved with earth fertility: see the anecdote, on the role played by the oracle of the Palici in one instance of famine, narrated by Xenagoras, FGrHist 240 F 21, ар. Macr. Sat. 5.19.30 (thus also Zieeler [n. 55 above] 118, and Lesky [n. 55 above] 1207). 58) Her mention under this name (Serv. ad Verg. Aen. 9.581; Silenus, FGrHist 175 F 3, ар. Steph. Byz. s. v. ПаАлкл; Lact. Plac. ad Stat. Th. 12.156-7) may either rest on a different version, or be due to textual corruption, say of a longer phrase giving for Thalia her Aetnaean connection (see Rufin. Recogn. 10.22.5 'lup- piter stuprai] Thaliam Aetnam nympham ... ex qua nascuntur apud Siciliam Palis- ci, where one should like to correct to Aetnaeam [given the implausibility of a double name 'Thalia Aetna'], beside Palici). At any rate, there is no need to assume (with KG. Welcker, Griechische Götterlehre [Göttingen 1863] III 189-95, followed by Ciaceri [n. 24 above] 31) that Thalia is a corrupt form of Aithalia, which, in its turn, should be a variant of Aetna. 59) I strongly disagree with Fraenkel s view ([n. 1 above] 63), and I cannot help wondering why he was so categorical about scene four, since also scene two was located in the area of Leontini. In the midst of the almost unanimous consen- sus gained by his view, it is remarkable that La Rosa (n. 1 above) 153-4 should favour at least act one and two, and Corbato (n. 1 above) 67 even a series of scenes for the dramatization of the Palici story.</page><page sequence="20">306 Letizia Poli-Palladini least all the scenes, from one to four, dealt with their broader story, i. e. the story of Thalia and Zeus. It is also conceivable that already within this part of the play some more incidents and/or characters appeared (the Xuthia scene is, as we said, a good candidate), whose dramatization could go on and be fully developed in scenes five and six. In one word, once the conclusion has been reached that in all probability the broader story of the Palici made up the bulk of the dramatized action, there is no real basis for the view that the play was no proper tragedy with a dramatic economy, but a series of aetiolo- gical tableaux, all alike and unrelated one another. Nonetheless, I am not going to deny that aetiology must have dominated the play. Indeed, once selected (or invented) and elab- orated a remote story, the playwright must have turned to aetiolo- gy again and again, as the most obvious procedure to both dignify the present, and express blessings of prosperity and political con- cord. An instructive combination of aetiology (of both the Areo- pagus tribunal and the cult of the Semnai), with blessings for a city (Athens), which verge on political paraenesis proper, is provided by Eumenides. This guess about the (frequent) use of aetiology within a con- sistent and Unitarian action set in the remote past of Sicily, is made plausible by our few data, (a) The play was set in the remote pre- historical past (see above, fr. 6 R.). (b) Somewhere in the play the foundation of the city of Aetna was prospected as a synoecism with blessings for its inhabitants (Vita Aesch. [= T 1 R.] 33-4 ... èrceÔei^axo xàç Aïxvaç oicoviÇójievoç ßiov àyocoòv toîç cruvoiKÍÇcn)- ai tt)v nóXiv60). (c) The settings of the play are the very places which in the 470s were being affected by Hiero 's policies. The events on mount Aetna could provide the background for the fu- ture foundation of a city of the same name. Some support to this admittedly speculative, however likely, attempt at reconstruction, comes from a group of vase-paintings61 60) I take this statement in the Vita as a faithful précis of the play, and hence as a scrap of evidence on it, although I am aware that a more sceptical approach may reject it altogether. 61) I have drawn the following remarks from A. Kossatz-Deissmann, Dra- men des Aischylos auf westgriechischen Vasen (Mainz 1978) 33-44, to which I refer the reader for a full catalogue and plates. Almost the same (with up-dated bibliog- raphy) can be found in Ead., Thalia (2), LIMC VILI (1994) 896-8. See also L.

С (plus three plastic representations, from Taras, dated one to the fourth century, the others to a period between the second half of the fourth and the beginning of the third century B. C). All of these represent Thalia (with inscription of her name in one spe- cimen, a Paestan amphora, ca. 330-10 B. C.62) being abducted by a big bird of prey (whether it be meant to be an eagle or a vulture, it is hard to say). The latter, on the basis of literary evidence dealing with Thalia, is reasonably taken as Zeus under disguise: see (though badly corrupt) [Clem. Rom.] Homil. 5.13.5 (Zeùç awn^Ge) 'Epaaicro vü|i(pr|i yevóuevoç yó'|/, кх^., to which corresponds Rufin. Recogn. 10.22.5 (luppiter stuprai) Tbaliam nympham mutatus in uulturem, eqs.63. As usual with tragedy, the vase-paintings do not provide any clue to the theatricality of the represented scene; so the link between them and a given play is bound to remain a supposi- tion, however reasonable64. In our case, the supposition that the common scene of Thalia's abduction has any bearing to our play, is made more plausible by the fact that one specimen occurs on an Apulian amphora (340-30 B. C, Berlin F 3239) which is decorated with two more scenes apparently inspired by fifth-century drama: Chrysippus' abduction by Laius (Eur. Chrysippus), and Actaeon's death (Aeschyl. Toxotidesf5 . Moreover, the above-mentioned Paestan amphora, although preserved only in a drawing by Tischbein, bears a more detailed image of Thalia being abducted by a bird of prey, inasmuch as it represents an altar, a sort of halo around the animal (i. e. its divine 62) A.

It is remarkable that Kossatz-Deissmann (n. 61 above [1978]) 33-44 (but also passim) inclines towards theatrical interpretations of the vase-paintings ex- amined, whereas Ead. (n. 61 above [1994]) tends to consider the iconography of Thalia per se. This iconographie autonomy may indeed be conceded for the Taran- tine sculptures. 65) A. D. Trendall/A.

All this implies a full narrative centred around Thalia, which is just natural to identify with part of the plot of Aetnae(ae). The latter can therefore be reconstructed, however hypothetically, as follows. Thalia and her friends (or sisters), nymphs of mount Aetna, were playing ball67 in the open nature nearby the altar (and sanctuary?) of Zeus Aetnaeus68. Suddenly a bird of prey (i. e. Zeus) seized Thalia and lifted her up into the air. The other nymphs may have fled in panic; then they may have started seeking Thalia. At some point in the play, the foundation of the city of Aetna (possibly together with the foundation of the Pa- lici cult) could be prospected by Zeus as a way to make up for Thalia's inconvenience by honouring the memory of the mount where he had loved her. It is a common situation in mythical love- affairs between a major god, especially Zeus, and a nymph or a mortal woman, that their offspring should be granted some kind of honour, and that some place should be named after the mistress (or some other detail of the affair)69. To admit a close link between fourth-century vase-paintings (in particular the Paestan amphora) and our play means to accept the idea that Aeschylus was still well-known, through performance 66) See the acute analysis by Kossatz-Deissmann (n. 61 above [1978]) 38-9. 67) Compare a similar situation in Od. 6. 100 ff., which was brought on stage by Sophocles in his Nausicaa (Athen. 1.37.19-20 К. = T 28 R.); note that Nausicaa and her maids have their picnic in a basket (Od. 6.76-8). Another similar situation, but for the detail of picking flowers instead of playing ball, is to be found in the myth of Europa abducted by Zeus (see Moschus* Europa); but on an Apulian amphora, Napoli H 3218 (see Kossatz-Deissmann [n. 61 above (1978)] 38 n. 206, Trendall/Cambitoglou [n. 65 above] II 497), she is abducted while playing ball with her mates. 68) I prefer to think of a place of cult sacred to Zeus on the slopes of mount Aetna, rather than of the altar of the Palici, as Kossatz-Deissmann (n. 61 above [1978]) 39 does. At any rate, the vase itself, with a bare representation of an altar, does not provide any clues either way. 69) If this outline recovers part of the plot of Aetn., then what was 'tragic' about it? Of course we cannot tell for sure, although there seems to have been plen- ty of scope for developing a tragic action (i. e. Hera's persecution of Thalia; how to grant her sons survival; her premature sort of death; a struggle for power possibly involving a Xuthus) - at least as much as in other plays on divine seduction of a mor- tal woman and its consequences (Aeschyl. Callisto, Semeie; Soph. Danae, Tyro /, //; Eur. Alartene, Alope, Antiope, Danae, etc.).</page><page sequence="23">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 309 rather than reading, in Sicily and Magna Graecia. This supposition is begged by the whole set of western Greek vases studied by Kossatz-Deissmann (n. 62 [1978]), all of which seem to represent scenes of Aeschylean dramas. However, the idea that fifth-century Athenian theatre should be much performed and appreciated among the western Greeks in the following century, as much as to be reflected on locally produced vases, has been recently discussed - i. e. stated afresh for tragedy, and originally advocated for come- dy70. The most remarkable point made by that discussion is per- haps that socio-political particularity of Athenian fifth-century drama, especially comedy, need not have been a major obstacle to appreciation and popularity in the wider Greek world71. The point is interesting also to those who consider what the 'Nachleben' of our play, which was Syracuse- and Dinomenidae-specific, may have been like. To our reconstruction of the plot of Aetn., which is mainly based on vase-paintings, one may object that the latter reflect not Aeschylus' tragedy, but either (a) the spurious Aetnae(ae) record- ed in the Catalogue of Aeschylus' plays (T 78 R.), or (b) a fourth- century play by an unknown and, given the local theme, probably local author72. Such objections, though, are not fatal. For, on the one hand, we know almost nothing on the spurious Aetnae(ae), neither where they were performed, nor whether they were ever as popular as to be reflected on vase-paintings73. On the other hand, 70) Taplin (n. 64 above). 71) Taplin (n. 64 above) 94-9. 72) This is what C. w. Dearden, Fourth-century tragedy in Sicily: Athenian or Sicilian?, in: J.-P. Descœudres (ed.), Greek Colonists and Native Populations (Canberra/Oxford 1990) 231-42, especially 233-4, infers from the fragment of an early south-Italian bell-crater (Cambridge, Mass., Fogg Art Museum, inv. n. 1952.33; К 8 in Kossatz-Deissmann [n. 61 above (1978)] 35). 73) One guess (Pohlenz [n. 1 above] II 200 [but cf. also U. von Wilamowitz- Moellendorff, Aischylos. Interpretationen (Berlin 1914) 242 n. 1], Cataudella [n. 1 above] 398) is that, when the Cataneans took back possession of their city and terri- tory (461 B. C), they had a new play composed (and possibly performed) which rep- resented their own version of the events leading to the foundation of the city of Aet- na, and which was meant as a reply to the highly propagandistic play commissioned around 470 by Hiero. Another guess (C. Corbato, Una ripresa eschilea nella Pace di Aristofane, in: Studi triestini di antichità in onore di L. A. Stella [Trieste 1975] 323- 35, 330 n. 19) has it that the so-called spurious play was in fact a version of the ori- ginal one, revised for performance in Athens by the poet himself in order to suppress the most celebrative and specific (or rather ideologically embarassing) points.</page><page sequence="24">310 Letizia Poli-Palladini there is no inner necessity in the argument that fourth-century vase paintings of possible theatrical nature must reflect a fourth-century play, and that a theme with local connections such as the story of Zeus and Thalia must have been dramatized by a local playwright - especially as we do positively know that Aeschylus dealt with that story in Aetnae(ae). The most economical stand is to connect those vase-paintings with Aeschylus' play, if one accept their 'theatricality'. There is a possibility that even after the fall of the Dinome- nidae Aeschylus' drama continued to enjoy popularity. If the play was set in the remote past, as I have argued, and conveyed celebra- tion of Hiero 's policy through aetiology, the propagandistic elem- ent could be tolerated more easily than if the play crudely brought on stage the object of its praise. Again, the propagandistic gist of the play may have been of such a tenor as to please most the Dorian aristocracy of Syracuse (see below) - nor to annoy the population of, say, Acragas or Taras, even in later times. For the emphasis might have lain on their desiderata (aristocratic freedom and equal- ity, monarchy as a military office, supremacy of the laws) rather than on the reality of Hiero 's tyranny. The message of Greek domi- nation over the local peoples was destined to keep its appeal also after the fall of tyranny (apart from the short and utilitaristic entente cordiale with Ducetius on the part of post-tyrannical aristocracy-led Syracuse74). If that was the case, the play could not fail to retain its popularity even after the political contingency in which it had been commissioned, not only in Syracuse, but throughout Sicily and Magna Graecia. One more point. Neither the vase-paintings, nor the capitel- reliefs which represent Thalia's abduction can help decide whether Zeus is disguised as a vulture or as an eagle. Although Pseudo- Clemens and Rufinus talk of a vulture, it is suggestive to suppose that in Aeschylus' play the bird was an eagle, with some (para-)ety- mological connection between Aïtvoc/AÎtvocîoç and cciexóç in his typical manner, but also with reference to the symbology of Zeus 74) On that alliance see F. P. Rizzo, La repubblica di Siracusa nel momento di Ducezio (Palermo 1970) passim; on 'democracy' in Sicily after the fall of the Emmenidae and Dinomenidae see, e. g., D.

Title77 By ruling out the possibility that the play dramatized the present time; by taking Thalia, the name of the mother of the Pali- ci given by Macrobius and Stephanus of Byzantium, as the genuine- ly Aeschylean; and by linking the above-discussed Paestan ampho- ra to the play (with the consequence that Thalia must have been playing ball with someone, i. e. the other nymphs, before the abduc- tion): in so doing, I end up by accepting the form Aixvmai as the authentic title, referring to the chorus of nymphs of mount Aetna. By 'authentic title' I mean the form under which the play was known to the Alexandrian scholars78, and was registered in the source of our Catalogue of Aeschylus' works. The poet himself may have attached little importance to the compendious name cur- rently used to denote this play, as for any other play79. One may 75) The institution of the cult of Ze')ç 'EXevGápioç in Syracuse after Thrasybulus' defeat and expulsion (D.S. 11.72.2) seems to be a reaction to the cult of Zeus promoted by the Dinomenidae. 76) G.

(frr. 6-11), who also gives references to the opinion of mod- ern scholars on this issue. 78) Since there is no good reason to believe that the play was performed also in Athens, the title is unlikely to have been included either in Aristotle's Didascali- ae, or in its source, the official records of Athenian productions. For the same rea- son it can be supposed that in the Alexandrian edition of hypotheses to Aeschylus' plays, Aetnaeae was put at the end, and that the roll of its text kept company, in one and the same case, to the rolls of the plays whose titles began with the last letters of the alphabet, maybe from cp- onwards. The like has been supposed for Euripides' Archelaus by E. G.Turner, Euripidean hypotheses in a new papyrus, in: Proceedings of the IX International Congress of Papyrology (Oslo 1961) 1-17, especially 3. 79) The titles of Aeschylus' individual dramas are clearly not his own in two cases, Seven against Thebes and Eumenides. For these the poet, his audience, and the contemporary official records must have used the collective name of the tetra-</page><page sequence="26">312 Letizia Poli-Palladini suppose that at the time of performance and later, the drama was identified either after the chorus, which I am confident was made up of Aetnaean nymphs, or by the name of the city it was meant to celebrate, Aetna. (I rule out the possibility that the plural Aetnae may have given a suitable identification label, because the plurale tantum is poorly attested for the city, if it is attested at all80, where- as a plural referring to the repeated setting of mount Aetna, and to the mention of the future name-sake city is a far-fetched idea81.) That variable denomination may be the origin of all subsequent shifting in the form of the title. Yet, for the latter, we need not go that far, since corruption of titles of lost plays in quotations is extremely common, and understandably so, as those titles were not well-known82. As I said, I believe the chorus was made up by nymphs of mount Aetna, either friends or sisters of Thalia, a nymph of mount Aetna herself83. That they should be women of the city of Aetna84 is ruled out by the remote time setting of the play. The idea of male citizens of the same city (accepting as title Arcvm)85, based on the ground that logies they belonged to; individual titles will have become common as a conse- quence of separate performances and/or book-trade.

Above I have argued that the hypothesis of a bizarre, episod- ic play is unwarranted and completely unlikely. So I have under- mined the supposition on whose basis Fraenkel, then followed by most scholars86, has conjecturally assigned the famous 'Dike- fragment' (fr. 281a R. = P. Oxy. 2256 fr. 9[a]) to Aetnaeae. But there is more87, (a) First, the fragment is likely to belong to a satyr-play, as the colloquial conjunction oxir| (1. 9) proves (this was inferred by the first editor, Lobel). Against its occurrences in satyr-play and comedy alone, but never in tragedy, nor serious poetry in general or prose (see LSJ s.v.), the argument that Aeschylus may as well have used it whenever he wished to88, is untenable89. Nor can one lightly attribute to a tragedy the fragment where such a colloquial- ism occurs, on the ground that this time the playwright was too concentrated on political issues to heed formal minutiae90, (b) The apparent seriousness of the scene is no sufficient ground to rule out logue proves that the authentic title should be in the masculin plural; rather it may be due to assimilation to voöoi and should be emended to yvnaim. 86) rrom Pohlenz (n. 1 above) 11 198 to Cornato (n. 1 above).

See, e. g., fr. 47a R., where several stretches sound serious in themselves, albeit the overall situation is gently lu- dicrous; the like in Soph. fr. 314 R., and, though more rarely, in Eur. Cycl. (c) The appearance of Dike need not imply a tragic and ser- ious context. In fact, her featuring as a character is unparalleled in tragedy (and in drama outside our fragment)91, where she is rather at work behind the events, or is invoked. Generally speaking, tra- gedy admits of gods on stage, but not of more or less extemporary personifications of less established anthropomorphic nature. These are rather at home in comedy: see, e. g., Diallage, Spondai, Wrong and Right, Polemos, Kydoimos, Theoria, Opora, Penia, Plutos92. (d) The whole apologue of the rcoûç jiócpyoç, whoever he may be93, is couched in a fairly plain school-teacher style, which seems to be- come an exchange between Dike and the ignorant satyrs better than two parties in tragedy, (e) Indeed, it is hard to conceive a tra- gic situation, however remote, whereby the chorus need to be taught who Dike is and what her tasks are. Satyr-play, with a chorus of rather animal beings, is a more satisfactory supposition. So the case for a tragic, rather than satyric, attribution of fr. 281a R. has collapsed, even though we are not able to guess to which satyr-play it belonged94. Fraenkel was led to assign it to Aetnaeae by his preconceived ideas that the play was episodic, and that its propagandistic content had to consist of a mere celebration of just- ice and peace as marks of a new era inaugurated by Hiero 's military victories. This, as we shall see, entails a remarkable reduction of the propagandistic function of the play. That in Pindar's First Pythian (67-72) peace, both in domestic and foreign affairs, should be invoked for Aetna, does not surprise. What is more meaningful as 91) See F.W.

(For the latter fragment, a tra- gic context seems more likely, although we cannot say which exact- ly95.) But at least Fraenkel was aware of the fact that these were only conjectures based more on his impressions than on arguments. His followers, on the contrary, have taken for granted his views, and from that 'basis' have developed other ideas (one example below). 5. Did Aetnaeae belong to the same trilogy as the 'Prometheuses't It has been supposed96 that Prom. Vinctus and Prom. Solutus, both regarded as the genuine work of Aeschylus, were followed in one and the same trilogy by a play other than Процпбе-ос лирсророс (considered as an erroneous form for Про|х. jrupmeúc), and that this play should be Aetnaeae. Vital to Aeschylus' Prometheus-plays, the argument goes, was some sort of agreement being reached and struck between Zeus and the Titan. Prometheus was to deliver the fatal secret; Zeus was to free him and send Dike to mankind: see the Prometheus myth in Plat. Prt. 322c. Aetnaeae, with its setting suit- able to Hephaestus, and other links with the Prometheus myth (Ty- phoeus' imprisonment and Aetna's volcanic activity), especially the arrival of Dike among men (accepting Fraenkel's attribution of fr. 281a R.), was the third play in the trilogy. Several points object against this hypothesis (which, however, has enjoyed little favour97), (a) Even if we grant Aeschylus' au- thorship of Prom. VinctHS and Prom. Solutus, internal data of the former (in metre, style and rhetoric) point to a late date, even later than the Oresteia9*. (If that were the case it would be inescapable 95) The parallels brought by Corbato (n. 1 above) 71-2, especially Aeschyl. Supp. 630-97, far from proving his case, make clear that a wish for, or a praise of, peace was common enough to occur in many a tragedy. 96) H.

It seems to me that R.Bees, Zur Datierung des Prometheus Desmotes (Stuttgart 1993) does not achieve any substantial progress in the Trometheusfrage' over either M. Griffith's (The Authenticity of Prometheus Bound [Cambridge 1977]) or Pattoni's (as before) researches. 99) 1 hus and only thus can a connection between the trilogy and bicily be put forward (see e.g. Herington [n. 98 above (1970)] 113-5), whereas Prom. Vinc- tus does not betray in itself any obvious signs of Sicilian influence, as it has been shown by Griffith (n. 97 above) against the common version of the 'Sicilian theory' (e.g. F. Focke, Aeschylus' Prometheus, Hermes 65 [1930] 259-304). 100) Some scholars have favoured only one place of performance, either Aet- na or Syracuse (Mette [n. 89 above] 395, Rehm [n. 1 above] 31); others (U.von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Hieron und Pindaros, SBAkBerl [1901] 1273-1318 [= Id., Kleine Schriften (Berlin 1972) VI 234-85], especially 1284 [247], T.

Also, the celebrations of the newly founded city were surely meant as a means of spreading and asserting the ideo- logical purport of the whole procedure. The propaganda contained in Pi. P. 1 and Aeschylus' Aetnaeae was perhaps more needed at home, among the fretful aristocrats, than in Aetna, among colonists who had just been beneficated by Hiero. On the other hand, it is quite natural to imagine the same cele- brations, including Aeschylus' play, going on in Aetna as well, perhaps on the first occurrence of the festival Ai/cvaîoc102, whether Catane-Aetna had a theatre at that time103, or a temporary struc- ture had to be erected for the special occasion. G. Vallet, Pindare et la Sicile, in: Entretiens de la Fondation Hardt, XXXI, Pindare [Vandœuvres/Genève 1984] 285-320, especially 307-8) have admitted the possibil- ity of two, though leaving the question open. A similar question is begged by Pi. P. 1, by many believed to have been performed alongside Aetnaeae, within the same celebrations of the newly founded city: e.g. Wilamowitz (as before) 1279 (241), E. Cingano (in: B. Gentili al., Pindaro. Le Pitiche [Milano 1995] 9) think of Aetna. 101) The Syracusan architect Damocopus was mentioned by Sophron, to- gether with the occasion which prompted his nick-name (having completed the theatre, he got (rúpov distributed to his fellow-citizens): Sophron fr. 128 K.

Bernabò Brea, Studi sul teatro greco di Siracusa, Palladio 17 (1967) 97-154: sed hoc archae- ologi uiderint. 102) If indeed this festival dedicated to Zeus, se.

They may belong to a fifth-century theatre, as supposed by Anti (n. 101 above [1947]) 125-8 (was it in the theatre that Alci- biades spoke in front of the Catanean assembly [Th. 6.51.1]?); but then, it is still un- certain whether this dated to the Dinomenid period of the city, or later.</page><page sequence="32">318 Letizia Poli-Palladini 7. Staging Supposing my attempt at reconstruction of the plot is correct, we may wonder how much of it was brought on stage, with special reference to (a) Thalia's abduction by the bird of prey, (b) her sink- ing into the earth. (As to the 'birth' of the Palici, we can be reason- ably confident that nothing like their pond, the craters, and the bubbling water could be brought on stage.) (a) I, for one, have no qualms about imagining Aeschylus working out the actual staging of the abduction104. The spectacu- lar scene with a big eagle (or vulture) gliding down, seizing and lift- ing Thalia up into the air, could be achieved by means of the so- called yépccvoç or |ir|%avr|105, a machine which must have been strong enough to carry two actors (see Lyssa and Iris in Eur. HF, the Dioscuri in Eur. £/., Apollo and Helen in Eur. Or.). Even if the play in question had been composed for Athens, I would admit such a spectacular staging. In fact there is no good rea- son to deny Aeschylus the use of stage machines106, unless one is so biased as to suppose him utterly alien from spectacular devices. In the case of Syracuse, however, I am even more inclined to recon- struct a grand staging. For the theatre was new, and provided with a larger and more advanced range of stage machines than the con- temporary theatre in Athens107. The existence of such facilities may have induced Aeschylus to make a full use of them. The fact that all of the vase-paintings and sculptural reliefs probably inspired by 104) Let it be enough here to say that I deem Taplin's case ([n. 1 above] 253- 4, 432-3, 443-7) against the use of the crane in Aeschylus far from convincing, as resting mainly on a bias against spectacle in this playwright. I find myself very close to the position of Di Benedetto/Medda (n. 9 above) 19-22. 105) Although Pollux treats the two separately (4.128 T| M-T|XavTl $е oeodç ôeÍKvuai Kai лрсос toùç èv àépi BeAAepocpóvxaç r' Ilepaéaç Kai Keîxai ката xtiv àpioxepàv rcapoôov, wièp xt]v gkt|vt|v то ityoç kxA.., 130 B. t| ôè yépavoç 'Lr'%ávr][Lá èaxiv ек цехешрог) mxaípepóuevov è(p' аряаут)1 acojiaxoç, ài K£%pTixai 'Hòç àprcáÇoixja xò аюца xò Мецлчпюс), it is sensible to take them as one and the same machine. 106) Cf.

Of course, whereas such structures as Charonian steps can still be detected, it would be vain to seek rests of the yépavoç, a machine which was pre- sumably taken away after the performances in which it was used.</page><page sequence="33">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 319 Aetnaeae represent the abduction may testify to the deep impact the spectacular scene had on the audience. (b) As to Thalia sinking into the earth, it is hard to take a stand. The only parallel for such a staging would come from Prom. VinctHS, if indeed the protagonist there was swallowed into the earth (with the chorus) at the end of the play. As everybody knows, that is a very controversial issue in itself108. I incline to think that i f a stage device of this description ever existed, that was in the re- newed theatre of Syracuse, where Aeschylus could use it around 470 and again around 457, supposing the Prometheuses were actu- ally composed by him, and for Sicily on his second permanence there. ///. Propaganda 1. A suitable myth We have seen above that at a time when several myths were circulating about alleged antecedents to Greek domination in Sici- ly and Magna Graecia, Aeschylus moulded a new story to a simi- lar effect, which at the same time could afford repeated occasion of justifying and extolling Hiero 's policy. 2. Hellenized Palici Aeschylus, who gave the Palici a Greek genealogy, was the first Greek author who dealt with them (Macr. Sat. 5.19.16, Steph. Byz. s. v. ПоЛиеп)109. That such a novel step was taken without premedi- tation and consideration of its propagandistic effect, is scarcely credible. So most scholars have seen in this procedure the reflection 108) See a judicious discussion in Taplin (n. 1 above) 273-5. 109) On the cult of the Palici see D. S. 1 1.89, Macr. Sat. 5.19.15-9, Steph.

Bello, Ricerche sui Palici, Kokalos 6 (1960) 71-97.</page><page sequence="34">320 Letizia Poli-Palladini of one item of Hiero 's policy, namely of his attitude towards the Sicels. This is quite reasonable, since the Palici were autochthonous deities highly worshipped in the island, very soon also by the Greeks, and who could attract Sicel nationalistic feelings. But this acknowledged fact has been variously interpreted. It has been read (a) as a reflection of Hiero's attempt at assimilating the Sicels to his state, and conciliating their friendship110. Or (b) as one aspect of a policy aiming at peaceful coexistence of different ethnic entities (Sicels, Greeks of the three stocks, i. e. Aeolians, Dorians, and Ioni- ans)111. Or (c), more exactly, as a reflection of a policy whereby the Sicels were subdued to the Greeks, who, in their turn, were assim- ilating local elements, especially in the field of religion112. 1 would in fact rule out any willingness on Hiero 's part to be friends with the Sicels on a basis of mutual respect, and also the all too modern idea of multi-ethnic society. That the Sicels were treated unscrupu- lously by Hiero (as by the land-owing aristocrats, and by Gelon be- fore him) is proved, among other incidents, by the fact that in the Aetnaean region he deprived a group of them of their land, so that he might give it to the new colonists of Aetna (cf. D. S. 1 1.49.1,76.3). As to the Sicels in Syracuse, we do not know whether they still were all laAA/úpioi (Hdt. 7.155.2), or some of them had at least gained freedom, if not political rights. Still, we can doubt that many of them watched Aetnaeae sitting in the audience (if the play was performed in that city); and even more that they, not being allowed to watch the performance, could get written copies of the text. So, any propagandistic message directed at the Sicels would have come to nothing. (The like will have been even truer for an Aetna per- formance, if there was one, because it does not appear that any Sicels were among the colonists.) I am not envisaging the assimilation necessarily involved in the hellenization of the Palici as a means of unifying different class- es and ethnic groups113. Yet, it would be rash to deny the Dinome- 110) Pohlenz (n. 1 above) II 199, Cataudella (n. 1 above) 396-7, Corbato (n. 1 above) 67.

White, Demeter's Sicilian cult as a political instrument,</page><page sequence="35">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 321 nidae any awareness of the potential usefulness of religious policy. A plausible supposition is that the hellenization of the Palici en- tailed to assert once more that the Greeks had been well integrat- ed in the traditions of the island since the remotest times, as though they were its natural masters. A similar idea was implied in typical- ly Greek cults which lent themselves to local connections (e.g. Zeus Aetnaeus, Hephaestus, Heracles, etc.). 3. Emphasis on the Dorian element It is well-known that the Dinomenidae, Hiero in particular, favoured Dorian cities and settlers against Ionians. Such an ethnic opposition should not be dismissed too light-heartedly114, al- though it is true that the Greeks of different stocks were themselves able to coexist115. Indeed under, and by, the Dinomenidae the eth- nic issue was often raised, as scholars have persuasively argued116, in full awareness of the political consequences of that step. Gener- ally speaking, ethnic opposition could, from time to time, be a real threat to political stability within the highly mixed Greek city- states of Sicily. So, any action taken against the Ionians was in a sense a preventive measure. Secondly, the ethnic opposition pro- vided an honourable pretext to their policy of forced synoecisms and dioecisms, which depended on broader political and strategi- cal considerations117. GRBS 5 [1964] 261-79; G.Zuntz, Persephone [Oxford 1971] 70-5; G. A. Privitera, Politica religiosa dei Dinomenidi e ideologia deWoptimus rex, in: Perennitas. Studi in onore di A. Brelich [Roma 1980] 393-41 1), in spite of a tenacious communis opi- nio which made of the Dinomenidae the responsible for the diffusion of that cult to that end (cf. e. g. E. Ciaceri, II culto di Demeter e Kora nell'antica Sicilia [Catania 1895], Id. [n. 24 above] 191). 114) As, e.g., by E.Will, Doriens et Ioniens (Paris 1956), passim, and 58-61 on Pindar (included P. 1.61-5); contra: J. Alty, Dorians and Ionians, JHS 102 (1982) 1-14. On Will's historically conditioned approach see Malkin (n. 31 above [1994]) 39 n. 115. 115) See the example of Himera, with its population partly Ionian, and part- ly Dorian: Th. 6.5.I. 116) Maddoli (n. 40 above) II 52, Vallet (n. 100 above) 309-10. 117) The deportation of the Chalcideans of Catane and Naxus to Leontini seems to have been prompted not only by Hiero 's wish to found a new city (Aet- na), and hence to gain for himself the status of oikiottÎç - which may have been achieved also by founding one ex novo - , but also by his need to keep the Ionians</page><page sequence="36">322 Letizia Poli-Palladini In terms of domestic policy, the Dinomenidae had to take into account the demands of both propertied aristocracy and properti- less masses, since they owed their power in Syracuse to discord between the two groups, and their success in bringing them to- gether118. However, while the masses could be easily satisfied in a prosperous city, the aristocrats could object to their rule on matter of principle, too. It is not by accident that when the last of the Dinomenidae, Thrasybulus, was opposed and defeated, the aristoc- racy closed ranks against him. So, it is quite probable that Pi. P. 1.61-6, a passage in praise of the Spartan-like institutions granted by Hiero to Aetna, gives voice to one of the political purposes of that foundation. That is to say, faced with ever growing opposition to the illegal basis of his power, Hiero would have tried to show the aristocrats that he himself was in favour of a monarchy of Spar- tan type. Thence the stress on freedom (i. e. the aristocratic notion of freedom and equality among peers), on the military nature of the supreme authority, on laws which are warranty of concord between citizens (again i.e. aristocrats) and king. In this view, Hiero was ready to implement these desiderata in Aetna rather than in Syracuse, even though he wished to exploit the full propa- gandistic potentiality of this act mainly in Syracuse. All this is very likely, given the extent of Pindar's passage and its being filled with specifically political terms119. Now, on the basis of the Pindaric passage, it is a fair supposition that Aetnaeae too contained some, close at hand under his vigilant eye (cf. Vallet [n. 100 above] 308-10, Basta Donzel- li [п. 1 above] 74), and to hinder any tight alliance of them with Anaxilas, the tyrant of Rhegion (cf. Vallet [n. 33 above] 367). 118) See G.Bruno bunsen Aristocrazia e democrazia nella politica di Gelone' in: OiAíocç %ápiv. Miscellanea di studi classici in onore di E. Manni (Roma 1980) I 294-308. On Gelon's ascent see Hdt. 7.155. 119) The best representative of this view (followed by G.Méautis, Pindare le dorien [Neuchâtel 1962] 160-1, and considered plausible by e.g. CM. Bowra, Pindar [Oxford 1964] 133) is E.Kirsten, Ein politisches Programm in Pindars er- stem pythischen Gedicht, RhM 90 (1941) 58-71, somewhat anticipated by Wila- mowitz (п. 100 above) 1278-9 (240-1), Id., Pindaros (Berlin 1922) 300-1. The other view (Will [п. 114 above] 58-61, Basta Donzelli [п. 1 above] 80-2), which takes the named passage to refer vaguely to a general aristocratic ideal of 'good government', more as an expression of the poet's own feelings, and wishes for free- dom in Aetna, and military glory, than of Hiero 's propagandistic ends, has the odds against itself.</page><page sequence="37">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 323 perhaps indirect or aetiological, praise of the Dorian institutions set up by Hiero in Aetna120. Similarly, an issue both political and ethnic may have been im- plied by the scene set in Xuthia. Above I have put forward the hy- pothesis that this scene either brought on stage, or somehow men- tioned, the eponym Xuthus, and identified his grand-father Hip- potes with the Heraclid Hippotes. In that case the political purport of the scene would have been to provide a mythical antecedent to Dorian (i. e. Syracusan) sovereignty over that area, against any Io- nian (i. e. Chalcidean) claim, based on the different (and probably older) story of Xuthus the son of Hellen. This view121, however speculative, seems to me more attractive than the other ones, i. e. that the Xuthia scene was either meant (a) as the 'Ionian' scene in a play providing a dramatic interpretation of an alleged new bal- ance between Dorians and Ionians implemented by Hiero122; or (b) as the 'Aeolian' scene, and that the play, a series of ethnically dif- ferentiated tableaux, conveyed a message of peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups123. View (a) identifies the eponym of Xu- thia with the more familiar Xuthus, and takes that scene to have had an 'Ionian' meaning (no better specified). Diodorus' context (5.7-9) is ignored, just as the unlikelihood of a poet working for Hiero and, at the same time, asserting a story in support of Ionian claims over Leontini. View (b) rests on a confusion of Aeolus the father of Xuthus (D.S. 5.7-8) with Aeolus the son of Arne (D.S. 4.67), and on the supposition that each act was devoted to a differ- ent ethnic group (but one wonders what the Aeolians were at in eastern Sicily), the last celebrating Syracuse's alleged panhellenism. 4. The playwright Hiero commissioned Aeschylus with a play to celebrate the foundation of Aetna and assert the ideological purport of this deed. That in all probability included praising what had been achieved by 120) It is well-known that Hiero not only commissioned but also managed coherently a lot of propagandistic poetry, so that one theme was often taken over from one poet and developed by another (Privitera [n. 113 above] 410). 121) Which I partly share with Maddoli (n. 40 above) II 53. 122) Mazzarino (n. 38 above) I 555. 123) Garzya (n. 1 above) 407-8.</page><page sequence="38">324 Letizia Poli-Palladini means of forced deportation, as a blessed synoecism, asserting Greek supremacy over the Sicels, and Dorian supremacy over the Ionians, extolling Spartan-like institutions, and, perhaps only in- directly, eulogizing the Dinomenidae as exemplary rulers. This whole episode in Aeschylus' career, however little we positively know of it, is most interesting. It shows a good poet working out artistic devices to meet the demands posed by the patron, quite ir- respectively of the ideological purport of the commissioned work. It is striking that in all likelihood one main dramatic device (final aetiology with identity of place to bridge up the temporal distance: see above) should have been used again in Eumenides, to celebrate completely different institutions and political set-up. More gener- ally, it shows our playwright in the same attitude of ideological flexibility as we are prepared to find in lyric poets. This episode of Aeschylus' career has hardly ever been fully appreciated124, just be- cause it clashes against very tenacious assumptions. Some of these are that, through his plays, Aeschylus educated his audience to the 'good', preached in earnest like a prophet, supported democracy out of deeply-felt conviction, or that tragedy is essentially and in- herently a democratic genre. Under these assumptions scholars have either neglected Aetnaeae, or have tried to find explanations for the paradox they thought to be faced with - Aeschylus work- ing for a tyrant very much like Simonides, Pindar or Bacchylides. So it has been imagined that our play must have either asserted an ideal of peaceful coexistence in a multi-racial society, or struck some note of serious reflection on the fate of the deported Chalci- deans, or divulged a message of concord and co-operation among the different ethnic entities, or left room for the Ionian Leontini alongside the Dorian Syracuse125. Now, all these conjectures are not only speculative, but also rest on a biased discomfort about our data. Apart from the fact that there is no need to excuse Aeschylus for having pleased a tyrant, those excuses, all aimed at finding some 'good' intentions after all, are all unconvincing in the case of a drama commissioned by a tyrant, who used to exploit the pro- pagandistic potential of poetry. All in all - omitting to refute here the other above-mentioned assumptions - the conclusions to draw 124) A partial exception is Griffith (n. 97 above) 106. 125) The first view is by Garzya (n. 1 above) 407-8; the second by Rehm (n. 1 above) 33; the remaining ones by Basta Donzelli (n. 1 above) 93-5.</page><page sequence="39">Some Reflections on Aeschylus' Aetnae(ae) 325 from Aetnaeae about the playwright are the following. First, and in general, Aeschylus was no "prophet of democracy"126: for, had he been a constant militant in the democratic party (supposing the existence of such one in Athens before the 460s), and had he resort- ed to his tragedies as a vehicle for propaganda of his own political creed, not only he would hardly have accepted Hiero 's mercenary proposal, but also Hiero would have had qualms about commis- sioning him of all poets with that propagandist^ piece of work. Secondly, at least in the particular case of Aetnaeae, Aeschylus proved to be as ready to work for the mercenary Muse, as Simo- nides, Pindar, Bacchylides.
