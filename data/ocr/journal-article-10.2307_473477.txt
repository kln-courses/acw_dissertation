The effect of German liberal theology on Unamuno's religious philos- ophy is the subject of Nelson Orringer's latest analysis of modern Spanish thought. Its special emphasis falls on El sentimiento trigico de la vida (1912), and its partial inspiration comes from Albrecht Ritschl's Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Vers6hnung (1870-1874). His extensively researched documentation does not result in a mere source</page><page sequence="2">248 Reviews HR, 55 (1987) study, however. If we consider the host of issues that multiply in the intellectual wake of Unamuno's well-known spiritual crisis, we realize how firm the scholarly critic's hand must be in controlling his discursive strat- egy. Not only must Unamuno's thought be elucidated in bilateral relation to Ritschl, Harnack, Wobbermin, and other disciples or colleagues on the "izquierda protestante," but the very hierarchy of issues and ideas itself requires attention. Then too there are the multilateral comparisons or contrasts among the religious ideas themselves, together with judgments to be coordinated as to which thinker is to be identified with particular ideas, and to what degree. Cognizant of these difficulties, Orringer shapes his book by a chapter order intended to demonstrate Unamuno's debt to Ritschl through separate issues that, at the same time, entail other think- ers. The result is an overly fine synthesis whose texture will best be dis- cerned by readers already familiar with the conceptual strands so tightly woven together in this study. Unamuno derived from Ritschl his grand plan for STV, beginning with the "problem" of mortality and moving to the idea of God and the Christian ethic that seeks to govern human affairs. Orringer will argue, given Una- muno's practical view of religion-which eschews rationalism, metaphysics, and dogmatic absolutes-that the Ritschlian theology of individual, human primacy suited very well the Spaniard's affinities and emergent worldview. After identifying the members of the Protestant constituency in a lengthy Introduction, Orringer devotes his first chapter to the idea of the soul's supreme value and the concern for an eternally lasting personality. Unamuno's intention is to "catolizar el punto de partida filos6fico de Ritschl" (p. 61). It happens, however, that Unamuno's "man of flesh and blood" coincides with the "moral animal" conceived by the Pascalian Au- guste Sabatier, as well as with key ideas of Alexandre-Rodolphe Vinet and William Ellery Channing. As a result, discussion of immortality, resur- rection, and the personal desire for salvation extends briefly first to social and economic issues, and then to the problem of consciousness. The complex weave thickens in Chapter ii, devoted to "la raz6n te6rica contra el afin de perdurar." Its thesis is that Unamuno, as Ritschl, sub- ordinates abstract knowledge to the practical cognitive needs of will and soul. But this entails questions of human destiny rooted in the issues of dogma and the rational method. Thus Chapter ii begins abruptly with Schleiermacher and a background view of his relation to Ritschl and Vinet. Discussion of the reason-feeling conflict proceeds for the next few sections in a context of Unamuno, Vinet, Sabatier, Spinoza, Troeltsch, and Hiigel. When Orringer reaches the critique of the idea of soul, he begins the section with Unamuno's psychology, attributed in this area to the ideas of Wobbermin, who received them from Koch. The unity of these chapters is most clearly seen in Orringer's proleptic</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 249 summary in the Introduction, whose phrasing is dominated by Ritschl: "Unamuno parte, como la teologia de Ritschl, de una concepci6n del hombre como tal." But whereas the latter stresses redemption and ethics, "Una- muno, guiado por sus lecturas de Harnack sobre el catolicismo, todo lo subordina a la salvaci6n" (p. 55). Chapter ii indicates, as I mentioned, Unamuno's and Ritschl's shared subordination of "el conocimiento dis- cursivo al practico y religioso. Pero en Unamuno todo el saber se reduce al finico problema del destino humano, problema que . . ha aprendido en Sabatier. ... Para saber la verdad de la vida y del universo, hay que escoger, como intuye Kaftan, el camino mistico. Pero, al elegirlo, como apuntaremos en el capitulo tercero, Unamuno se deja orientar por Har- nack" (p. 55). Unamuno is led to conceive of God in an intuitive, anti- Scholastic anthropomorphism, as do "los ritschlianos. .... Pero se aparta de ellos cuando considera con Vinet, con Robertson y con Origenes [sic], la posibilidad de un Dios tan humano, que sufre." Chapter v concerns the history of religion, where Unamuno uses Sabatier to counter Harnack. And chapter vi concerns his ethics or moral values, which for Orringer are a synthesis of ideas also found in Ritschl, Sabatier, and Channing. The subject of religious thought opens so many categories-redemption, free will, communion, revelation, dogma, ecclesiastical reform, liturgy, faith, etc.-that it is difficult to cast a net over them without entanglement. In reading Orringer, one must bear in mind his trinary grouping of Eu- ropean Protestant thinkers to be found in Unamuno's library: the German Ritschlians, the French descendants of Schleiermacher, and the British liberal theologians. In this perspective, the numerous instances where Unamuno differs from Ritschl-subordinating all to salvation (p. 55), tol- erating some metaphysics (p. 85), abandoning an earlier antimysticism (pp. 106-07), entertaining pantheism (pp. 112, 136), inverting beatific roles (p. 137), not basing faith on confidence in God (p. 139)-are not distracting. As Orringer notes in his Conclusion, to move from the German to the French sector of Protestantism should not surprise, given Unamuno's readings. Orringer seems exhaustively familiar with these sources, and it is a stroke of fate that his book, completed in 1982, could not build upon the study published in the same year by Jos6 Maria Martinez Barrera, Miguel de Unamuno y el protestantismo liberal alemdn (Caracas: Imprenta Nacional-Ministerio de Informaci6n y Turismo). Here the background analysis for German thought, the texts of Unamunian marginalia, and a chronology from 1897 to 1912 might have led Orringer to cast a pan-Eu- ropean net over his commanding knowledge of categories so resistant to orderly system.
