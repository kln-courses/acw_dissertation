<plain_text><page sequence="1">OLEG SERGEEVICH PUGACHEV THE PROBLEM OF MORAL ABSOLUTES IN THE ETHICS OF VLADIMIR SOLOV'?V KEY WORDS: V. S. Solov'?v, morality, Absolute Good, Godmanhood INTRODUCTORY REMARKS The word "problem" in the title of this paper requires some prelimi nary clarification and a precise definition. The renowned Russian philosopher, who engaged in an active theoretical and practical "justification of the Good," resolved this task, fully convinced of the absolute axiological status of a morally acknowledged and accepted postulate: the Absolute Good, the source of which is God, is acting independently in the general evolutionary and socio-historical process. Under the conditions of earthly life it passes through specific stages which, in the words of Solov'?v, may be called the gradual development of the human within man. The term "moral absolute" appeared, most probably, in the 19th century. In West European literature on ethics in the 19th and early 20th centuries it is widely employed,1 and the same is true of Russia. However, after the October Revolution, the place of the absolute was taken, in the new ideology, by other concepts: it was displaced through an absolutization of the relative, and the concepts of "the absolute" and "moral absolute" were consigned to the field of "dead dogma" and of idealist (or, what was said to be the same thing, reactionary) philosophy. But in the late fifties and early sixties of this century this suppressed concept reappeared on the pages of philosophical litera ture, and not only as an object of criticism. In more specialized and standard works alike, a dichotomy of two spheres of application of the concept of "the absolute" became widely accepted: on the one Studies in East European Thought 48: 207-221,1996. ? 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">208 OLEG SERGEEVICH PUGACHEV hand, "absolute" was defined as unconditional, as irreducible to any thing but itself, and, at the same time, as the condition of everything else; on the other hand, it was understood as the basic, fundamental sign of something. I want to stress this division, hoping that in what follows it may help preclude misunderstandings with respect to the use of the plural in the phrase "moral absolutes."2 It is clear that I mean the second aspect of the concept. Vladimir Solov'?v did not employ the expression "moral abso lute" in his works. I am, as it were, placing a particular theoretical and methodological grid on his texts, but this is not a purely mechanical adjustment of the object of study to an already existing theoretical mould, but an investigation based upon a preliminary analysis of some of Solov'ev's works, which makes it possible to speak about his moral philosophy under the aspect of moral absolutes. It seems to me that this Russian philosopher has achieved a synthesis of the two sides of the concept of "absolute" that I have distinguished. However, the problem of moral absolutes in the moral philosophy of Vladimir Solov'?v has several levels, the analysis of which is complicated by their intersection. This makes it possible to speak of a certain "hierarchy" of moral absolutes, however strange that may seem at first sight. On the other hand, one must note the existence of a highest moral absolute, namely the Good, and, bearing in mind the hypostatization ofthat term, one can not leave aside its profound semantic and methodological fullness. Much work was done before Solov'?v toward establishing a stable center around which all moral life would turn. Heading the list comes Kant, with his famous categorical imperative as the absolute foundation of morality. And although Hegel separated the moral and the ethical [Sittlichkeit vs. Moralit?t, - Trans.], perceiving their origin in the depths of Absolute Spirit, Solov'?v was the first to see this absolute as alive and active, as being not only that which requires us to recognize the inevitability of moral action, but also that which belongs to our true essence, not only in its actual (momentary) state, but also as developing in the historical, social, and spiritual world. The ethics of Solov'?v can be defined as an ethics of the absolute good. Here the following elucidation is essential. First of all, Solov'?v understood the ideal, properly philosophical plane of divinity differently from the way in which, for example, Hegel or</page><page sequence="3">THE PROBLEM OF MORAL ABSOLUTES 209 Schelling constructed it. The main difference is in the very concep tion of the Real [suscee]. For Solov'?v, the Real, to which he of course tried to impart an objective character, is strictly speaking the Supra-Real [sverkhsuscee], i.e. the absolute raised to such a degree of inner tension that what is essential and determining in it is concen trated in a pole of meaning and objectivity. And this is fully justified by the logic of the further construction: it is not Being [bytie] that comprises the Real, but it is the latter as such - I use the word "itself" for accentuation - that itself has Being, retains it; and not only retains, but owns, possesses it. This quite unusual course in Solov'ev's thinking demonstrates in fact that profound element in his teaching, which, in its tendency, is opposed to pantheism, and which, at the same time, explains much of the hierarchic system of the divine organism that he constructed. The All-Unity [vseedinstvo] does not bear the vestiges of a conceptual and philosophical indef initeness, owing precisely to the concentration just indicated. This concentration specifically means that the Supra-Real acquires the features of... a person. It seems possible to locate the origin of such a conception of the Absolutely-Real [Absoljutno-suscee], where it is not situated in being, but, as we already noted, possesses it. That origin is the Jahweh of the Old Testament, an especially personal God who in His perfections - Omnipotence, Omnicompetence - shows himself to be an Absolute Reality [Absoljutnoe suscestvo] - or the Absolutely-Real - in full plenitude. The first philosophical attempts at a construction of the ontological - or, more appropri ately, extra-ontological or supra-ontological - order of things do not yet occasion talk about a properly ethical problematic. But it is worthwhile to turn to an analysis of Solov'ev's text, since the ethical motive can be easily revealed at the level of the highest philosophical and theological abstractions. THE ABSOLUTE AND THE SUPRA-REAL [SVERKHSUSCEE] The most complete definition of the Absolute [Absoljut], in all the interconnections and interrelations of its aspects, occurs in Philosophical Principles of Integral Knowledge3 (the work remained unfinished), first published 1877 in the Zumal Ministerstva narodnogo prosvescenija (Journal of the Ministry of Public Educa</page><page sequence="4">210 OLEG SERGEEVICH PUGACHEV tion). The overall line of Solov'ev's thought here is the following: the goal of mankind is life blessed and eternal, determined by principles that are located beyond the realm of the natural and the human, and hence transcendent. The supreme center of purpose [celevoj centr] - the sphere of the absolute - determines the meaning of all realms of social and individual life, which by themselves are not capable of having meaning. Defining his own system as "integral knowledge," Solov'?v assumes its subject-matter to be the "Truly Real" [Istinno suscee] regarded under two aspects: a) the inner ["an-und-f?r-sich], and b) the outer, i.e., in relation to the empirical reality of the subjec tive and the objective world, of which it is the absolute first cause.4 Solov'ev's system of philosophy is made up of three "organic" parts: the first part takes as its subject the absolute principle as such, in unity with otherness - this is organic logic; the second part exam ines the absolute principle in the phase of its dissociation, that is, when it produces and posits finite reality outside itself - this part is organic metaphysics; and the third part - organic ethics - has as its subject the absolute principle reuniting the finite world with itself in an actual synthetic unity.5 The combination of an "organic" and a "synthetic" approach, elaborated in those days by Schelling and Spencer and, in Russian philosophy, by Kireevskij and Khomjakov, allowed Solov'?v to move further along the general line of development of contemporary philosophical thought. As far as the definition of the third part of his system - organic ethics - is concerned, let me limit myself here to a rather general definition.6 Suffice it to note that, presumably, the process (or act) of reunification of the finite world and its absolute principle is called "ethics" on the strength of the Schopenhauerian concept of "sympathy," which is implicit here. Solov'?v himself remarked that for some time he was very strongly influenced by this German philosopher. If the Supra-Real presents itself to Solov'?v as absolutely unique, Being is already interaction, appearing as a manifestation of the relation of the Real with something other. Not wanting to enter into a detailed exposition of Solov'ev's solution of the interesting problem of the interconnection of the absolute and the relative, I want to single out one moment only: the "a priori" introduction of the moral into the structure of the divine "organism," which is highly</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEM OF MORAL ABSOLUTES 211 characteristic of Solov '?v. While understanding the unity of Self and Opposite as the supreme logical law, he regards this law at the same time as a merely abstract expression ... of the grand physical and moral fact of love. Love is the self-denial of a being, its affirmation of some other, and at the same time, through this self-denial, it achieves its highest self-affirmation. Egoism, i.e. the absence of self-denial or love, is not a real self-affirmation of a being. Thus, when we say that the absolute principle is, by its very definition, the unity of itself and its negation, we are repeating, albeit in a more abstract form, the words of the great Apostle: "God is Love."7 Solov'?v defines the aspiration to being as the aspiration to another absolute. The question of the two absolutes, which has given rise to much discussion in the literature dedicated to the Solov'?vian heritage, is best clarified, in my opinion, by a recognition of the unconditional moral strength of love, regarded in this connection, of course, as also existing in the supra-natural, "other-worldly," metaphysical world. This is, presumably, a first "reduction" of the Absolutely-Real (or the Supra-Real) to a moral absolute. I realize that this is a complicated and debatable conclusion, but Solov'?v underscores the absolute status of love both in his theological and properly philosophical arguments. For instance, the absolute principle is said to remain "one and the same in all the diverse manifestations of its essence or love,"8 and well-being is defined as "the moral harmony of spirit, intellect, and soul."9 MORAL ABSOLUTES: THE CONCRETIZATION OF THE SUPRA-REAL After digressing into this theoretically important work I can now raise the question as to the interrelation of the Absolutely-Real and the moral absolutes, limiting myself for the time being to Love and the Good. This question logically implies further questions: what do the Absolutely-Real and the moral absolutes have in common, and what makes them differ? Following the logic of Solov'ev's text, we have to note that the first, the Absolutely-Real, has a two-fold abstract definition as all and as nothing: it contains everything in itself and it is itself the condition of everything, simultaneously remaining, by virtue of the very etymology of the word - "absolutum" from "absolvere" - "separated," free from everything, and "finished," "full," "entire."10</page><page sequence="6">212 OLEG SERGEEVICH PUGACHEV But the moral "feat of love" [podvig ljubvi] that the Absolutely Real performs with respect to something else remains a metaphysical enigma to us. Its essence comes down to this: if love is an essential characteristic of God, i.e., His essence, then where is the ground of this feat to be found? If its ground lies within the relative world itself by virtue of its relative and transient character, then once again it is created by the Absolute, caused by divine fate, as Solov'?v has it. The result is, in this way, that at the level of maximum abstraction morality is not deduced from, but introduced into, the sphere of divine organism as a specific postulate and an essential characteristic. The use of such "anthropomorphic" attributes as "moral act" or "love as in the human world" justifies the claim that what becomes explicit here is a structure of thought about God and the world that is Neoplatonic to the highest degree. If we could limit ourselves to that statement, the remainder of our task would be resolved rather easily: 1) on the one hand, there is a transcendent Supra-Real (God), and this is the true Absolute, whose essential features are absolute and true in the purely intelligible world; 2) on the other hand, in the earthly world these absolutes can be transformed by temporal (socio-historical), objective (natural), and subjective (personal) conditions. In this manner, the problem of moral absolutes, at this abstract level, consists in the fact that, in the world, relative as it is, they too undergo certain transformations. In other words, they already are "relative moral absolutes." Here, however, another question arises: what is it then that, here on earth, sustains their absolute status, how ever incomplete it may be? "The Real," Solov'?v writes, "... cannot, as such, be given to us in cognition - that would be a contradic tion; however, being the sole Truly-Real [istinno-suscee], i.e. the substance of everything, it is also our own originary substance, and thus it can and must be given to us not only from without... but also from within, as our own personal foundation."11 I think that it is not excessive to define the moral absolutes in Solov'ev's ethics as moments in the logical and ontological concreti zation of the All-Unique Real [vseedino-suscee] (or Supra-Real). As I said earlier, Solov'?v ascribed supra-ontological status to the Absolutely-Real, a status that logically entails the concept "nothing."</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEM OF MORAL ABSOLUTES 213 Although this "nothing" is not empty, it is not a "something" either; only by positing itself in the realm of the relative, the conditional and the temporal, can Absolute Reality, while remaining All-Unity, "confirm" its plenitude. In this manner, then, its attributes begin (although this expression may be too bold and not quite correct) their separate and autonomous existence. This is especially noticeable in the "functioning" of Blessing [Blago], Love, Absolute Good, Truth, and other moral absolutes, which begin as it were independently to determine certain aspects of the earthly being of mankind. Sometimes, when this independence appears, the philosopher hurries to reduce it to the categories of All-Unity; in other instances, however, it manifests itself to such an extent as to have provoked reproaches by L. Shestov or K. Mochulskij. These come down to the allegation that Solov'?v replaced God by his own inventions: the Absolute Good, etc. The frankness and directness of such attacks can lead to the trivial idea that Solov'?v is even guilty of hypostatizing the attributes of Absolute Reality. One may well question whether this conclusion has a real basis. It undoubtedly has, but under the following conditions: a) a complete disregard of precisely the ethical, moral nature of these concepts, and b) an unwillingness to take them into account as moral absolutes. As far as we know, Solov'?v nowhere makes a special proviso with respect to this process of hypostatization, although he often points to the Good in itself, Truth in itself, etc., as independent of our own aspirations, wishes, passions, strivings. This in essence is the problem of moral absolutes. One might say that they have a moral being in the Kantian sense of that term, though for Solov'?v this is conveyed through an interpretation which differs from Kant's. The moral world is made up not only of the world of the Absolute, but also of the world of man's essence, which Kant, as we know, denied to man. If the entire realm of properly human, so to speak "here and now" morality, is, for Solov'?v, covered by shame (styd), love (compassion, sostradanie), and veneration (blagogovenie), then these are moral absolutes of a different, specifically earthly level. Their characteristics are universality (i.e., they are, in principle, applicable to an imaginary world), a bond with the unconditional (this is especially worth stressing), development, depending on the degree of the social and individual level, achieved at any partie</page><page sequence="8">214 OLEG SERGEEVICH PUGACHEV ular moment in time, the constancy of an "idea" not excluding the possibility of a total distortion of its content.12 In this manner, then, moral absolutes are as it were glimmer ing, concrete, and limited "forms" of the essential attributes of the Absolute and All-Unity, descending to the periphery of the divine organism in the same way as, once upon a time, resulting from a mysterious metaphysical activity, man descended to it, going through a Darwin-like evolution from animal man to normal man, and from there ascending to Godmanhood. At the basis of moral absolutes lies the Supra-Real as the truly One [istinnoe edinoe], but the process of its "transmutation" is, in our view, connected most logically with the existence of the relative. But in this relative world, in so far as Solov'?v defined man as a moral being, the moral absolutes have a non-transient status, especially in their "idea," in other words, in their connection to the sphere of the absolute. If man, as a being, had been regarded by Solov'?v as belonging to one world only, the status of morality itself and of moral absolutes would consist merely in their transcendentally sanctioned regulative function. However, in Solov'ev's ethics man is regarded as a being which belongs to two worlds at least: to the divine world, and to the natural world. The first relation is invoked to explain the eternity of mankind; in his Lectures on Godmanhood, the philosopher points out that it would be absurd to speak of the eternity of something that has a beginning. Man as an idea is eternal; man as a natural being has a beginning and an end. It is no accident that I describeded man as being related to at least two worlds: the point is that Solov'?v sometimes also singles out a specifically human element in his "structure," viz., reason. To sum up the results of my discussion so far: Absolute Reality (the Supra-Real, God), without coinciding with the world and with man, nevertheless is the foundation of both. Man, created in God's own image, belongs to the absolute world, too, as his essence is rooted there. Moral absolutes, being attributes of the Supra-Real, may change their purely absolute character under "earthly" condi tions, by virtue of the relativity of every, including earthly, being. These preliminary conclusions from what is basically the meta physical part of Solov'ev's philosophy are useful in order to bring out with greater force the specific character of his absolutist ethics</page><page sequence="9">THE PROBLEM OF MORAL ABSOLUTES 215 and of the moral absolutes when what is at stake are, to use the expression of A.F. Losev, wholly earthly, human, and vital needs.13 Here, more than anywhere else, the contradictory character of the moral absolutes comes to light, resulting, on the one hand, from the apparent contradictions of Solov'ev's system (some of which will be pointed out below). But, on the other hand (and this is more impor tant and interesting), these contradictions result from the ontological status of the moral absolutes, where their apparent reality as it were leaves no doubt as to their constant refutation [nisproverzenie], while at the same time the reality of spiritual life testifies to their neces sity, immutability, and the impossibility of opposing various kinds of moral relativism without relying on them. Typical of Solov ' ?v was the following logical grid for the solution of this or that dubious question in the moral context: he would take the point of view of the moral absolute and, analyzing its "natural" refractions in ordinary life, would always try to track down the true criterion for a moral appreciation and a fair judgment. Moreover, the fact that the train of thought "from top to bottom" (from ought to is) and "from bottom to top" (from is to ought) would now and then interweave, allowed him to lay bare what is called the truth of life [pravda zizni], Solov'?v recognized this truth, which distinguished him fundamentally from other, more abstract thinkers. But its highest correlate always remained the moral absolutes. MORAL ABSOLUTES, GOD, AND MAN The final question (which could become the first) is: what is it that confirms the existence of the absolute? It is the finite, conditional world, in whose existence we have an "immediate confidence" ["neposredstvennaja uverennost," "unmittelbare Gewissheif], which also leads us to the necessity of recognizing the absolute.14 In other words, everything hinges on the question of faith, and this is all the more important to stress because in what follows the by no means trivial concept of "moral faith" will be at issue. Quite naturally, it is also impossible to evade the question of the Divine Trinity; here, too, we encounter the same moral absolute, Love, as that which fuses the three hypostases into a single Supra-Real. It is often thought that the philosophy of Vladimir Solov'?v presents a rather easy case for analysis. It seems to me that this</page><page sequence="10">216 OLEG SERGEEVICH PUGACHEV approach to the matter is based on an "optical illusion," which at this point comes down to a confusion of easiness and the simplicity of the whole. Solov'ev's philosophy is a remarkably integrated phenom enon, as testified by the distinctively "concentric character" of almost every one of his works. That "concentric character" finds both a logical expression - in the attachment of "peripheral" arguments to their center - and a semantic one - through the unity of the engage ment and moral commitment of each work, irrespective of their great thematic variety. The philosopher himself drew attention to this peculiarity of his own creative work in the following statement: "I do not have a doctrine of my own, but I see my task [as consisting] in a defence, on different occasions, of Christianity as the fullness of spiritual, personal, and social life."15 Indeed, it does not require great effort to note the fact that the image of Christ is one of the most important centres of the overall state of Solov'ev's thought, not just its embodiment. Speaking of state, I am not seeking to single out some special aspect or accent of his "manner" of philosophizing. No, something else is at stake: the experience of the state of one's profoundest bond with Christ is characteristic of the entire Christian world. I mean first of all the "theoretical," theological oikoumenon. There is nothing particularly new about this: it is a mere statement of fact. However, this statement is needed at this point, because it is, generally speaking, logically prior, for it will help later on to determine concretely what Christ precisely means, to determine, that is, his image in Solov'ev's ethics as an ethics of moral absolutes. First of all, it should be noted that Christ, even as Logos, does not coincide with the Absolute, i.e., with the One Supra-Real [edinoe sverkhsuscee]. He is seen here as a hypostasis of a triune whole, a hypostasis endowed with specific individual traits, but abiding, as expressed according to the Chalcedonian Creed, "without confusion, change, division or separation" with the other persons of the Holy Trinity. In fact, the profundity and enigma of the "transcendence" only increase once we speak about the descent of the Son of God to earth. It is most appropriate, at this point, to stress once more, that the ethics of Solov'?v is Christian in its very essence, and that even though we can freely point to elements in it that exceed the limits of Orthodoxy, these are not capable of changing the over</page><page sequence="11">THE PROBLEM OF MORAL ABSOLUTES 217 all picture. Of course, it is possible to qualify it as a philosophical version of Christianity, but that is not the whole truth either, because, in that definition, the "transformational" level of Solov'ev's work inevitably moves to the fore as a much more profound problem, the roots of which lie in the author's aspiration to a maximum approxi mation of the truth proclaimed by Christ. Christ, in Solov'ev's conception, came to the world precisely in the "middle of time," i.e., at the moment when the conditions of historical, social, and moral life were so prepared as to accept (and reject) Him and the one in whose name He came. The world had, as it were, "ripened" for the New Testament. Christ, as the absolute and real person (this already is a tautology), as the terrestrial incarnation of the eternal Logos, as an active and living power, is often compared by Solov'?v with Socrates, Plato, Buddha, and other sages and prophets. This comparison, in which we can discern two lines, viz., an implicit and an explicit one, is never set forth in direct, i.e., bare and hence seemingly extreme, oppositions, though at the same time it is impossible not to see them. Thus, for example, in one of the Easter Letters, more precisely in the letter "Christ is Risen," the resurrection of Christ is at once a confirmation of his immeasurable positive qualities and of his moral perfection. The very applicability of the term "divine" with respect to a genius, whom Solov'?v undoubtedly loves and on whom he "depends" to the highest degree, is denied even to Plato, who lived through inner drama and the collapse of "his personal spirit." But Christ is divine, not by virtue of his omnipotence or his victory over death - he is the true God, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. In his discussion of the details of the moral doctrine of Chris tianity, Solov'?v was forced to acknowledge that, in fact, they are nearly absent. Regarding morality, Christ did not teach anything special in comparison to other religions. Solov'?v placed emphasis on Christ Himself as Lord and Son of God. The interweaving of the human and the divine, this difficult, most interesting, and always fruitful question, does not seem to have occupied Solov'?v as such. But in point of fact he gives an answer to it, one way or another, in his absolute ethics. He does so in the sense that for him Christ is not simply a conjunction of divine and human principles, but a conjunction of their plenitude. In Solov'ev's work this concept (like</page><page sequence="12">218 OLEG SERGEEVICH PUGACHEV several others) possesses a highly specific expressiveness and mean ing, which makes a special investigation urgently necessary. Here, however, this is only an incidental question, and I shall not touch upon its essence. The meaning of the term "plenitude" suggests a word of the same semantic order: "abundance." This second term may emphasize, and even somehow express, the special nature of the first: it is thanks to this abundance that, on the one hand, the human condition, by developing to its utter limit, naturally turns into the divine and unites with it, and that, on the other hand, the plenitude, the infinitude of the divine origin knows no obstacles and difficulties in taking into itself, in "adding" to itself, so to speak, the human. This is, probably, the only way to understand the idea that "This, man ...," the God-man Christ, rises as universality,16 that in him, "Super-Man" [Sverkhcelovek], arose the mass (or the enormous warmth and charm) of All-Man [Vsecelovek]. For Solov'?v, in his system of moral absolutes, this is the most vital and most immediate moral absolute and ideal. The relation of the philosopher to this living absolute can be expressed by only one word, Love. But he not only increasingly loves and venerates this living absolute, he also piously believes in it, throughout his entire life, until the very hour of death. ... But even that is too little for the relation to the Abso lute, to an ideal that occurred and was incarnated on a universal and historical scale. Solov'?v puts all his hope in Christ, relies on him, offering all of his own and mankind's past, present, and future, all his aspirations and hopes. It is here, in these complicated, seething, and central points, that the line of properly philosophical and ethical analysis shudders and strains, because here we must speak of things that, to put it mildly, are barely susceptible to analysis, but that are just as real as a crust of bread that saves a mortal man from hunger. The concrete characteristics of Christ in their comparative deter mination are as follows: a) Christ came to earth (but he does not flee the world, like the ascetics, sages, and hermits who renounce it); b) Christ defeated death (but he did not give in to it submissively and impassively, as did the great Bouddha, nor did he rejoice in it, as did the genius Socrates); c) Christ points to himself as to the source of a living teaching and of the coming salvation of the entire world of creation (but he</page><page sequence="13">THE PROBLEM OF MORAL ABSOLUTES 219 does not offer any ready solutions, prepared by somebody else or by himself; first and foremost, he is a door through which it is possible to enter the Kingdom of Heaven); d) Christ does not disavow or downgrade matter, but fights only with the flesh (whereas many oriental teachings saw evil in matter as such); e) Christ is the historical, cosmic, and personal center of the whole evolutionary process (as understood by Solov'?v), the center where all "force fields" of the political, national, economic, etc. life of mankind gather; f) He is an example, an ideal, and, as God, he is an absolute, the absolute and unique God-man personality; g) if the aim of the abstract philosopher is the comprehension and contemplation of the phenomenal and intelligible world, the aim of Christ is different: it is the union of Heaven and Earth, a union that does not consist of a simple merging (Solov'?v insists upon this distinction), or mutual absorption, but is conceived as the supreme harmony of the material and the spiritual, where matter appears in all its beauty, permeated by Spirit, and Spirit at the same time acquires its beautiful corporeality and its material force. In Solov'ev's ethics, man is regarded as the absolute form for the Good as the absolute content. The whole sphere of morality is deduced, in Solov'?v, from a feeling akin to shame, which then develops into conscience. On the one hand, shame is a signal to man that he is not identical with nature, with the material world, and that therefore he must resist being captured by his base, sensual inclinations. Sin does not lie in the fact that we have feelings, passion, but in the fact that we allow them to have us - such is Solov'ev's idea with respect to the hierarchy of the morally sublime and the base. On the other hand, the feeling of shame points to the fact that man belongs to the eternal, divine, absolute world. Therefore, we can regard the moral absolute of conscience, of shame, as a certain "bridge" that connects the absolute and the relative world. However, the living bond between the two worlds is the absolute of Love: Love ascending (from man to God), and Love descending (from God to man).</page><page sequence="14">220 OLEG SERGEEVICH PUGACHEV Sketching the evolution of mankind from animal-man to God-man, Solov'?v drew attention to the task of defeating death. Without that victory, he thought, it makes no sense to talk about the possibility of attaining, by human and other beings, the goal of the cosmic and social process, viz., the establishment of the Kingdom of God. If death is the great leveller, reducing both righteous and sinful life to a "common denominator," the sense of moral perfection is lost. But immortality understood as the perpetuation of imperfec tion and vices, does not make sense either. In Solov'ev's scheme of things death is seen as "that which should not be," and from a moral point of view as being "opposed to what is natural," as some sort of anti-absolute or anti-idea. As he absolutizes the values of human goodness, sympathy, pity, and love, Solov'?v cannot yield these to death, because the latter is mere negation, destruction, and always "lower" than life, precisely because it is the anti-absolute. It is in an abnormal world that what should not be happens: the righteous perish while falsehood and lawlessness flourish - that is the idea that struck Plato after the execution of Socrates. For Solov'?v, the world of the absolute is an ideal, understood as a norm. Therefore, the victory over death, the resurrection promised by Christ, is, from this perspective, the restoration of a normal rela tionship between God and the world. Therefore, from this point of view, moral absolutes are also images of normal relations between man and God, man and nature, man and man. CONCLUSION Moral absolutes were perceived, by Solov'?v, in a dual manner: a) from the side of content, of psychology, as when we speak of feelings, emotions, etc.; and b) under a formal aspect, as "ideas," i.e. logically. Neither of these can be treated without relating to moral absolutes as true, and without a rational belief m their truth, a truth that cannot be logically proved. In my opinion, our time has become keenly aware of the universally human value of Vladimir Solov'ev's ethics, of its humanist nature, oriented towards the everyday and the ideal tasks of man, and of the concrete direction of his philosophy of "practical idealism."
