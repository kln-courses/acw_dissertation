SCOTT 60 Estes Street, Lakewood, Colorado 80226 ABSTRACT: Mate-locatinz behavior was studied in 11 species of Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea. Three methods of mate location are defined: (1) perching (males sit at species-specific sites and investigate passing objects in search of females); (2) patrolling (almost continual flight of males in search of females); (3) pheromones. Territoriality is absent or rare in butterflies; perching males often fly to a new site and show the same behavior. Both perching and patrolling species range from sedentary to migratory, and the defense function of true territorial- ity is not fulfilled by butterflies. In perching species the female locates the male for mating. In patrolling species the male usually locates the female. Perching males use movement in the initial approach to a potential female, but patrolling males use color more, and some females are found by the use of female pheromone when a patrolling male approaches within a few meters of the female. Perching species usually mate in limited areas of the habitat, often during only part of the day, whereas patrolling species usually mate throughout the habitat at any time of day. Evolution from patrolling to perching or vice versa includes an intermediate phase, for which the "perching index" (proportion of copulations initiated by a sitting male to those initiated by a flying male) is proposed. Evolution of perching occurs if it is energetically wasteful to search due to low density or inefficient flight. Patrolling may be advan- tageous in cold areas where flight may serve as a heat-gain device. Perching may evolve in species which mate in small portions of the habitat because perching males often return to a place near the previous site after investigating a passing object. Selection for mating in a small part of the habitat may occur if that type of site is frequent in the range of the species, if the density of the species is low, or if females emerge in only part of the normal flight area. Evolution of mating on hilltops occurs primarily at low density. INTRODUCTION Few papers have considered the methods used by butterflies to locate mates. This paper proposes a classification of mate-locating behavior and discusses the behavior of several species studied by pre- vious authors and of 11 species I studied: Papilionidae: Parnassius phoebus Fabricius; Pieridae: Euchloe ausonides Lucas; Nymphalidae: Neominois ridingsii Edwards, Poladryas minuta Edwards, Precis coenia Hubner; Lycaenidae: Hypaurotis crysalus Edwards, Lycaena arota Boisduval, L. xanthoides Boisduval; Hesperiidae: Hesperia pahaska Leussler, Amblyscirtes simius Edwards and Ochlodes snowi Edwards. Details of these species will be reported elsewhere. An efficient mate-locating system is important to a population, because the expected life span of butterflies is usually only 1 to 2 weeks (Scott, 1973c). The mating system must be efficient enough to promote mating despite bad weather and low density. Bad weather reduces mat- ing frequency in Colias eurytheme Boisduval (Stern and Smith, 1960) and in Parnassius phoebus, and low density reduces frequency in Pieris protodice Boisduval and Le Conte (Shapiro, 1970). Mating at a hill- top rendezvous evolves primarily at low density (Scott, 1968). In 103</page><page sequence="2">104 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 91(1) Acraea encedon L., in which females outnumbered males, the popu- lation size was determined by the sex ratio of the previous generation (Owen and Chanter, 1969). The preoviposition period 'allows a few days for mating in most species. The preoviposition period lasts 3-8 days in Pieris brassicae L., Colias, Ascia, Cercyonis, Heliconius, Argynnis, Precis coenia, and Limenitis (Labine, 1968; Nielsen, 1961; Blunk, 1954; this paper). It lasts at most 1-2 days in Pieris protodice (A. Shapiro, pers. comm., Department Zool., Univ. Calif., Davis). Euphydryas editha Boisduval can oviposit immediately (Labine, 1968). Prior to presenting the results, the reader should know that the sex ratio of butterflies (including skippers, Hesperiidae) at emergence from the pupa is alnost always approximately one-to-one, except that males emerge a day or more before females (based on 45 species, Shields, 1967; Scott, this study; and others). The only known species which does not have a one-to-one sex ratio is Acraea encedon L., which has developed predominantly female populations in a few small areas in the last 50 years, due, apparently, to human disturbance (Owen, 1970). The sampled sex ratio may not be 1:1, since males are much more conspicuous than females because of their mate-locating behavior, while females generally disperse more than males (Scott, 1973b) and are less conspicuous. Sampled sex ratio may be influenced by (1) sampling time during the brood since males emerge a day or more before females; (2) the time of day of sampling if males mate only during part of the day; and (3) the location of the sample in relation to the mating or breeding site. All times are given as 24-hr standard time. I thank Jerry A. Powell, Glenn R. Scott and Arthur Shapiro for criticizing the manuscript. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The mate-locating systems of butterflies can be classified using three independent criteria: (1) the method used to locate mates; (2) loca- tion of mating; (3) time of day of mating. METHOD OF MATE LOCATION Butterflies use three methods of mate location: perching, patrolling and, rarely, long-distance pheromones. Perching. - I studied eight species (Parnassius, Euchloe and Hypaurotis are patrolling species). Other perching species previously studied are Hipparchia semele (Tinbergen et al., 1942), Hypolimnas misippus L. (Stride, 1956), Aglais urticae L. and Inachis io L. (Baker, 1972), Callophrys augustinus Westwood (Powell, 1968), Erynnis tristis Boisduval (Shields, 1967) and Agathymus spp. (Roever, 1964). In perching behavior, the male sits on some object usually characteristic of the species (the ground, a treetop, etc.), often at a characteristic height or location in the habitat, and waits for passing objects. When an object flies past, the male bursts out in a straight line and approaches within about 10 cm of the object. If the passing object is not of the</page><page sequence="3">1974 SCOTT: MATE-LOCATING BEHAVIOR 105 same or related species (i.e., of different appearance) as the male, the male usually returns abruptly to about the same spot he left. If a male chases a male of the same or closely related species (of similar appear- ance) which is flying past, the other male flies away when the perching male comes near, and the perching male usually returns to near the spot he started from often after a brief chase (lateral pursuit). An object flying slowly past in a pattern resembling that of the female is pursued farther than a fast or erratically flying object, at least in Precis coenia. If two males which perched next to each other investigate each other, they may separate almost immediately or both may fly to about 10 cm from each other and then rise some distance in the air (vertical encounter), then separate, whereupon they descend to near their previous perches, or occasionally a short lateral pursuit occurs. If a receptive female passes by, the male flies to within 10 cm and then pursues the female until she lands and courtship, occurs, or in some species courtship commences while the female is flying. The size range of objects investigated by perching males is comparable with the size of the species. Some species investigate a narrow size range of objects (Hesperia pahaska). The wide size range of objects investigated by other species (Precis coenia) has caused various observers to label them "pugnacious," an erroneous anthropomorphism. Investigative flights by perching males determine whether the passing object is a receptive female. Mating in all perching species occurs only at the perching sites and only at the times of day when males perch. An inci- dental result of perching is distributing males more evenly throughout the mating sites, since an approaching male is investigated, resulting in an encounter after which only one male returns to an individual perching site. Perching males also drive away previously mated females, because of harassment during repeated attempted courtship, but patrolling males can also cause females to disperse when the density of males is high (Pieris protodice, Shapiro, 1970). In species which perch in limited areas of the habitat, such as hilltops, few eggs are laid there because of this interference by males. Perching behavior is similar throughout the life of the male except for a brief inactive period after emergence from the pupa. Only in migratory species is there evidence that a perching species can disperse when young, then move less when older (Scott, 1973b). There is no evidence that perching species remain in one area longer because of increased copulation (Precis coenia and Poladryas minuta males which copulated moved the same or more than noncopulating males). Perching behavior is a process of screening passing objects for receptive females. The male flies only toward objects of acceptable size and movement, as far as can be determined, using his poor vision. Only objects of acceptable size, color and amount of fluttering are approached closely and pursued. When the male nears the object, odor becomes a further screening device; males may turn away from other males or pursue them only a short distance, while females are</page><page sequence="4">106 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 91 (1) pursued for much longer distances. Some mated older females are not chased far, apparently because of reduced pheromone signalling in Agathymus (Roever, 1964) and Precis coenia. The male may not pursue other males far because of lack of female pheromone in these two species, or perhaps because of the presence of male pheromone (Papilio zelicaon Lucas?), or because of the color of the male in sexual- ly dimorphic species (Hypolimnas, Stride, 1956). Perching males remain beside objects of acceptable size, color and fluttering as long as those objects remain near the perching site, and in most species males pursue for great distances only objects with presumed female pheromone. When tethered male Papitio zelicaon are brought to the ground, the pursuing free male flies away, but when tethered females (identical in appearance to the male) are brought to the ground, the male attempts copulation (Lawrence Gilbert, pers. comm., Zool. Department, Univ. Texas, Austin). Previously mated females of some species are treated as passing males. These visual and olfactory factors are discussed further by Scott ( 1973a) . Lack of territoriality in butterflies.-I believe that the word "terri- toriality" incorrectly describes male perching and that the terms "perching" and "patrolling" proposed herein should supplant use of the word "territoriality," which has been misused in the butterfly litera- ture. Small animals in general should be less territorial than larger ones because they are generally more abundant, and because small animals cannot see each other as well from a distance and thus are able to defend only a small area. Since there are no territories for feeding, roosting or oviposition in butterflies, only competition between perching males for females could possibly involve territoriality; thus, the only parts of the vertebrate definition that could possibly apply to butterflies are as follows: (1) many males must remain at the same spot for a period of several days; (2) males must be able to quickly distinguish males from females; (3) males must by intent drive other males from the area. The first criterion of territoriality above is not fulfilled by butter- flies, because males often change perch sites. Males often pursue objects beyond the area they can survey from their perch, and the further away the lateral pursuit, the less likely that the participants will return. The variation in amount of movement of most species is great (Scott, 1973b); some males remain in the same area while others move com- pletely across the habitat. Mark-recapture experiments were done for all 11 species (Scott, 1973b). When only tiny areas are studied, only the sedentary males will be recaptured, giving a distorted impression of movements. In most perching species, males remain longer in one spot when that is, the only suitable perching site in the area (Callophrys augustinus, Powell, 1968; Poladryas minuta arachne, this study). There is almost no relation between dispersal and perching or patrolling behavior; both perching species and patrolling species range from sedentary to migratory species, and in both types males tend to remain in areas favorable for locating receptive females, whereas females are</page><page sequence="5">1974 SCOTT: MATE-LOCATING BEHAVIOR 107 more widespread (Scott, 1973b). The only two species for which return to an area after experimental displacement has been confirmed are patrolling species (Papilio zelicaon, Shields, 1967; Philotes sono- rensis Felder and Felder, Keller et al., 1966). Concerning the second criterion for territoriality, there is almost no information on when, during the investigative flight, a perching male recognizes another male. The several-step process of screening pre- viously discussed would seem to rule out instant recognition. In many species males are probably not capable of distinguishing conspecific males from other males, and only females are differentiated. Recogni- tion of conspecific males by other males seems to require a species- specific male pheromone (which has not been demonstrated in perch- ing butterflies), because color is usually insufficient owing to confusion with related sympatric species; in Hypolimnas, however, the color of the sexually dimorphic male serves to deter other males (Stride, 1956). The third criterion of territoriality also is not fulfilled by perching species. The harassing investigative search for receptive females serves incidentally to disperse other males; however, territorial intent is lacking in butterflies. The so-called "defense" function of perching described by some authors can be interpreted as a mate-seeking response of the perched male and predator-avoidance response of a passing male. Since insect vision is poor for shape, there is no way for the passing male to know what is chasing him, especially since the chasing male is behind the pursued male and no olfactory cues pass from the perching male to the pursued. The pursued male naturally tries to escape the possible predator and flies rapidly away. The perch- ing male, of course, is the only individual with experience of the previous perching site, so only that individual returns (but often not to the exact spot). Returning is advantageous because this keeps the male in a favorable area and because it conserves energy which would be wasted if the male flew to another spot and was chased by a male perched there. Only when two adjacent perching males investi- gate each other does the lateral-pursuit part of the predator-avoidance response not occur, and both males may then return to near their previous perches after a brief encounter. Learning is not required for a male to return to the previous perch, because perching species usually have species-specific preferred topographic or vegetational perch sites; a perching male usually returns to or near the previous site only because that site is the nearest site preferred by the species. Encounters between males of the same or related species are more common than between males of greatly different species because males of the same or related species have similar appearance, behavior and mating sites. The behavior of males toward males of other closely related species is usually identical to the behavior toward males of the same species, even though only interference and not competition for females occurs between the unlike males. The behavior of perching male Precis coenia toward some mated females is almost identical to behavior toward passing males.</page><page sequence="6">108 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 91(1) The vertical encounters represent attempts to determine the sex of the other participants rather than defense, since several patrolling species (Erebia epipsodea Butler and Colias spp., Brussard and Ehrlich, 1970; Papilio zelicaon, Shields, 1967) also engage in vertical encoun- ters in addition to the usual lateral pursuits and brief circling. How- ever, vertical encounters are more frequent in perching species. Euphydryas editha Boisduval has lateral pursuits only in a colony in which only males patrol (Labine, 1966), but in another colony I observed (Connors Pass, White Pine Co., Nevada) where males only perch on hilltops, only vertical encounters occurred. Because many perching species rest near or on the ground, most investigative flights involve a vertical component, which contributes to the vertical encoun- ter; but the patrolling species fly constantly with no vertical component so that encounters between males are generally lateral. In some perch- ing species that perch on trees (Callophrys augustinus, Powell, 1968), no vertical encounters are observed. Vertical encounters are more likely to keep the individuals near their last perching sites than are lateral encounters; therefore, patrolling Papilio zelicaon males some- times have vertical encounters because they are on hilltops. Finally, vertical flights minimize interference from adjacent perched males. In Erebia epipsodea, patrolling males, after meeting, usually fly away faster than the normal flight (Brussard and Ehrlich, 1970); perching and patrolling males both have a space around them in which nearby objects are investigated (movable individual space); the only difference is that in patrolling species these spaces continually move. Perching behavior does not lead to a decrease in density of males, as does most true territoriality. Usually perching species perch in limited areas of the habitat, often mating only part of the day, so that the end result of perching in these species is to increase the density. Baker (1972) found that Aglais urticae and Inachis io change perching sites often, and that only two encounters between a passing male and a perched male are sufficient for the passing male to learn of the site. Thus, the probability of staying in the site is the same for both individuals. Baker (1972) claimed territoriality for these two species, based mainly on the observation that many males can be collected at a favorable site for perching as passing males take the place of the collected males. If the male is not collected, however, he usually returns after encounters and stays at the site for some time. This is true of most perching species, and was first noticed by Roever (1964) for Agathymus; I prefer to interpret it as movable individual space for the reasons stated above. Baker did not mark males individually, so some of his findings seem doubtful. Patrolling.-I studied three patrolling species (Parnassius phoebus, Euchloe ausonides, Hypaurotis crysalus). Species previously studied are Papilio glaucus L. (Brower, 1959), Papilio zelicaon (Shields, 1967), Pieris rapae L. (Obara, 1970), Gonepteryx rhamni L. (Lederer, 1938), Anthocaris sara Lucas (Evans, 1952), Colias eurytheme (Stern And Smith, 1960), Danaus gilippus Cramer (Brower et al., 1965),</page><page sequence="7">1974 SCOTT: MATE-LOCATING BEHAVIOR 109 Heliconius erato L. (Edwards, 1881; Crane, 1955), Argynnis paphia L. (Magnus, 1958) and Euphydryas editha (Labine, 1966). Males fly almost continuously about the habitat in search of females, stopping only briefly for rest or nourishment. When two males of the same or related species meet, there is usually a brief lateral pursuit, but some- times there is a vertical encounter. In many colonial species individuals are able to recognize the edge of a colony by some means (apparently by recognition of borders of a nectar source concentration in Parnassius phoebus; or the border of the larval host stand in Hypaurotis crysalus; or the edge of a shrub patch in Euphydryas editha, Ehrlich, 1961), and few individuals emigrate. Some perching species (Hesperia metea Scudder, Shapiro, 1965) also have the ability to recognize habitat boundaries. Patrolling behavior, like perching behavior, is a process of screening objects, but the relative importance of visual and olfactory factors differs; in patrolling species movement and size are less impor- tant for the initial approach than in perching species, while color and odor are often important both for the initial approach and during courtship. Some mated older females are not chased far, apparently because of reduced pheromone signalling in Euphydryas editha (La- bine, 1966) and Parnassius phoebus (Scott, 1973d). These visual and olfactory factors are discussed further by Scott (1973a). Long-distance pheromones.-The use of pheromones at distances greater than a few meters from the individual emitting the pheromone is rare in butterflies. Female pupae (but not male pupae) and occa- sionally female adults of Heliconius attract males from more than a few meters (Edwards,- 1881). Other females of Heliconius, however, mate when patrolling males. encounter them. Males of Ithomia heraldica land on a leaf, spread the wings, and expose the hair-pencils on the dorsal hindwing apparently to assemble females (Lawrence Gilbert, pers. comm.). Males of Euploea core extend their hair-pencils while in flight, and there is some evidence that this behavior attracts females from a distance (Brower et al., 1965). Ornithoptera flavicollis males fly with the front wings while the hindwings droop and the hind- wing pouch (probably a pheromone source) opens; at other times normal flight occurs and the pouch is closed (Skertchly, 1889). Since this behavior occurs in the absence of females, it may serve to attract them from a distance. For effective use of long-distance pheromones, the sender must remain in one spot. A male sender corresponds to perching behavior because the female must locate the male and the male must investigate approaching objects. A female sender corre- sponds to patrolling behavior because the male must fly to the female and then detect her while she is motionless. Perching index.-Probably few species fit perfectly the definitions of either perching or patrolling. In every perching species, at least some contacts with females leading to copulation are made by males flying between perching sites or at flowers. In some patrolling species, some contacts probably are made by males flying out from a resting site (Papilio zelicaon). The presence of both perching and patrolling</page><page sequence="8">110 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 91 (1) species in four of the six families of butterflies suggests that evolution from perching to patrolling and vice versa has occurred many times. This evolution probably included a transition period in which the species both perched and patrolled in search of females. For these transition species I define the "perching index" as the proportion of all copulations initiated by a male flying after a passing female from a resting position, compared to copulations initiated by a male already in flight. Poladryas minuta arachne and, perhaps, Limenitis camilUa L. (Lederer, 1960) are examples of perching species whose perching index is somewhat less than 1.0 (perhaps 0.9 in the former) which means that 90% of copulations were initiated by a male at rest. Papilio zelicaon is a patrolling species whose perching index away from hilltops is negligible, but on hilltops may be perhaps 0.2 or 0.3, since males seem to rest frequently after flying around the hilltopl, and may inve-stigate objects from a resting position. The perching index can be operationally estimated by measuring the proportion of time the male spends sitting or the proportion of investigative flights from rest if males investigate passing objects when sitting. Differences between perching and patrolling species (T'able 1). Usually in patrolling species the male actively locates the female, whereas in perching species the female may have to fly considerable distances to locate the male (Erynnis tristis, Shields, 1967), especially in those species where the mating site is separate from the larval development site. More precisely, in the latter perching species females fly to the mating site, then fly slowly about until investigated by a perched male. Perching species tend to use movement and size rather than color or pheromones for the initial approach to the female and TABLE 1.-Comparisons of perching and patrolling species Character Perching species Patrolling species Interaction between males Pursuits, often vertical Pursuits, seldom vertical encounters encounters Sex actively locating the other Females, when perching site Usually male locates female, different from larval de- except the few hilltoppers velopment site, then male locates female at mating site Use of vision in initial Use movement more than Use color and movement approach of male to female color Use of pheromones Used only at end of investi- Some females located when gative flight and during male flies near by use of courtship pheromone, then used in courtship Matings with unexpanded None Occasional females Number of matings per female O'ne to many in various One to many in various species species Time of day of mating Often mate only during part Usually mate at any time of of day day Mate in limited areas of Usually Seldom habitat Relation of mating sites to Often different Almost always the same larval development sites Life span Usually 5-10 days Usually 5-10 days Abundance Mostly less common Often very common Movements Very local to migratory Very local to migratory Cohesion of populations Usually not colonial Often colonial Distribution of host plants Variable, often widespread Variable, often in colonies Thermoregulation heat gain Males bask more than they Flight more important than device fly basking</page><page sequence="9">1974 SCOTT: MATE-LOCATING BEBAVIOR 111 then also use color and odor for recognition. In patrolling species the male commonly recognizes a resting female by color, and by use of pheromones occasionally finds females hidden from sight or females which have not yet expanded their wings after emergence (Parnassius phoebus, Papilio rutulus Lucas, Pieris protodice, Colias eftirytheme, Ascia monuste, Graphium marcellus and Heliconius). Males of most species probably carinot detect pheromones farther away from the female than 1 to 2 m, when they accidentally pass near, except in Heliconius and in several other species whose males can locate female pupae from greater distances, In species which mate only once, each mating fertilizes more eggs than in plural matings, so that searching might be. favored because newly. emerged females have weaker flight than older females; however, as many patrolling species as perching species mate frequently (Stott, 1973a). Perching species often mate during a restricted part of the day, whereas Almost all patrolling species mate at any time of day (Table 2). Most perching species mate in limited areas of the habitat, which are often different from the larval development sites, whereas most patrolling species show little preference for localized sites and almost always rmiate in the larval development sites. In species which perch.in restricted sites, larval de- velopment occurs elsewhere if the larval host occurs in locations where males do not perch, because females are investigated at the mfiating sites to the extent that oviposition is reduced. Hilltopping species, which certainly mate in limited areas (hilltops), are almost all perching species in southern California (Shields, 1967 . Patrolling species are TABLE 2.-Time of day of initiation of mating of butterflies.

The life span does not differ between the two groups (Scott, 1973c). The abundance of perching species in general is prob- ably slightly less than patrolling species, but this relationship needs more study. I found that based on collecting, hilltopping species aver- aged only one-fourth as dense a nonhilltopping species, and most of thle- hilltopping species were perching species (Scott, 1968). Evolution of perching or patrolling behavior.-Several situations probably favor the evolution of perching behavior: (1) Thermoregulation may play a role; in cold regions continuous Rflight may help maintain body temperature. Very few perching species live in the Arctic, but other factors such as widespread larval hosts may also be important there. The amount of energy expended during flight is probably also important; an inefficient flier that continuously flaps its wings may save energy by perching, while excellent gliding species 'such as Danaus spp. can cover large distances with less energy expenditure and so become patrolling species. The size of a species might be important because of efficiency of flight; both perching and patrolling species range from small to large, but there are few very large perching species. (2) If the density of a species is small, it may be energetically wasteful to search for females, but advantageous to perch and investi- gate promising passing objects. (3) If individuals emerge only in small parts of the habitat (habitat is normal flight area)., selection may favor males remaining longer in these parts. Also, some species which emerge widely in the habitat may evolve mating in only part of the habitat for the reasons discussed in the next section. Perching is an excellent adaptation if mating occurs only in part of the habitat, because after each investigation the insect returns near the last spot, and so remains within the favorable mating site. But males can also fly to another perching site between investiga- tive flights and thus do not sacrifice dispersal. Perching behavior also seems advantageous if mating occurs in a small area, because the ver- tical encounters and reduced lateral movement mean that more indi- viduals can occupy the same area with perching rather than patrolling behavior. The time and energy hypothesis for the situation (1) above will not work as well in this situation; for instance, on hilltops the energy expended by perching males may be as great as if the males patrolled around the hilltop, because of the large amount of inter- action of the several species present. Pa pilio zelicaon may be an exam- ple of evolution of perching behavior due to mating in a small area, because on hilltops the perching index is greater than away from hill- tops. Euphydryas editha illustrates this method of evolution of perch- ing behavior (Gilbert and Singer, in press). At the Jasper Ridge colony, movements are small, nectar feeding sites coincide with -mating sites, and males patrol constantly in search of females (Gilbert and</page><page sequence="11">1974 SCOTT: MATE-LOCATING BEHAVIOR 113 Singer, in press). At the Del Puerto Canyon colony, however, the feeding sites are often separate from larval development sites, resulting in greater movements; this means that mating occurs in a restricted part of the habitat. At the Del Puerto colony males perch often, espe- cially on the ridgetop. At a third colony in Nevada, males always perch on ridgetops and hilltops and rarely patrol. (4) Species which carry out all activities on the larval host are unlikely to develop perching behavior, because investigative harass- ment by perched males may interfere with feeding and oviposition. Patrolling behavior also results in some interference but it is not as concentrated because males soon fly to the next plant. (5) In dense species, patrolling by males may cause the females to mate earlier than in perching species, because females of perching species must fly to draw the attention of a male. In patrolling Euphydryas editha, early mating is coupled with lack of a preoviposi- tion period to produce a strategy of very rapid laying of the eggs, which are laid in clusters (Labine, 1966). LOCATION OF MATING Mating occurs only in areas where males perch or patrol. Perching species often mate only in limited areas of the habitat, such as hilltops, gullies, bare spots, stream sides or treetops, whereas patrolling species rarely are so restricted (except sometimes to areas of the larval host). That some patrolling species do mate primarily in restricted situations (Papilio zelicaon and Anthocaris cethura Felder &amp; Felder on hill- tops if available, Shields, 1967) suggests that an independent classifica- tion can be constructed. There are so many types of locations where mating can occur that it would be unwise to propose names for them. Among the "hilltopping" 'species, there are species that mate only on the tops of large hills (Stinga morrisoni Edwards in southern Colo- rado), large hilltops and ridgetops sloping from them (Hesperia pahaska, Poladryas minuta), small hilltops (Amblyscirtes simius), and plateaus only 3 m tall (Neominois, Hesperia uncas Edwards). Other species mate in moist meadows (Polites sonora Scudder), grassy swales (Atrytone delaware lagus Edwards), eroded gullies (Ochlodes snowi), flat, bare spots of ground (Precis coenia), tiny woods clearings (Lycaena arota), flat areas with larval foodplant (Lycaena xan- thoides), or in sunny wood edges, often in a corner (Inachis io). The three patrolling species that I studied mated throughout the habitat. The location of mating sites seems to depend on the topography of the usual habitat: H. pahaska mates on hilltops and usually occurs in chaparral habitats, H. viridis mates in gullies and H. uncas on small plateaus, and both are plains species. Because these three species are often sympatric, separate mating sites may serve to reduce interference between species. Mating sites are species-specific; there is no evidence that interference between species alters the mating sites. Hilltopping is more prevalent in chaparral and desert species because hilltops are</page><page sequence="12">114 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 91(1) frequent there (Scott, 1968), but is poorly represented in rain forest, taiga and tundra species. In species which mate in small parts of the habitat separate from the larval development sites, the female must locate these sites. Virgin females of hilltopping species remain near the site of emergence for a short period, then fly to the hilltop or ridgetop, mate, then fly away to lay eggs (Papilio zelicaon and Erynnis tristis, Shields, 1967; Hesperia pahaska, Poladryas minuta, Amblyscirtes simius and Neominois ridingsii, J. A. Scott, unpublished). In P. zelicaon only virgin females and unmated control females flew to a hilltop, where they flew slowly about the top until found by a male (Shields, 1967). For hilltopping species such as Hesperia pahaska and Potadryas minuta, almost all males perch on hilltops and ridges and almost all females mate there. The evolution of mating only in restricted sites of the habitat in- volves three steps, starting from a population mating at the larval host: (1) one requisite is that there is variation in genetic preference for certain parts of the habitat; (2) another requisite is that the density of individuals is low enough so that the species is not forced to occupy all of the sites available (in which case mating would occur every- where); (3) the next step, selection for individuals mating in one site more than another site, may arise in several different ways. First, if a particular type of site is more abundant where the species occurs, or individuals are forced to one site because of flowers or avoidance of wind, selection will favor individuals which prefer that site rather than another site which is rarely found in the species' range. Second, if a closely related species already mates in one site, then interference between species may select for mating in another site. Third, if the species is rare, there may be selection for mating in an area which serves as a rendezvous, such as a hilltop (Scott, 1968). Individuals mating in such a rendezvous may be selected for when the population falls to low levels, because individuals hunting randomly throughout the habitat may not encounter mates. This best explains hilltopping, because there are usually few hilltops compared to other topographic sites. At high density, most females are probably mated before they reach a hilltop, so that hilltopping has no advantage at high density. Group selection may accelerate evolution of localized mating sites, if populations mating throughout the habitat do not survive at low densities. TIME OF DAY OF MATING Most patrolling species mate throughout the day (weather per- mitting), but about half of the perching species mate during a restricted part of the day (Table 2). Perching species, because they also often mate in limited areas of the habitat, seem to have developed mate-find- ing systems that are more efficient at low density, because it is obvious that concentration of mating into small areas in a short period of time must increase the density of individuals rhating. Group selection may be necessary to explain the evolution of mating in one part of the day, as</page><page sequence="13">1974 SCOTT: MATE-LOCATING BEHAVIOR 115 explanations due to regular changes in weather during the day or time of day of emergence of females seem insufficient. It is possible that there may be selection for mating at a time of day when other species are not mating, to minimize interference. Often several species will occur in the same localities (with the same weather) and yet have different species-specific mating times. For instance, at one study area, Hesperia pahaska mates all day, Poladryas minuta arachne from 0700 to 1200, Amblyscirtes simius from 0740 to 1050, Neominois ridingsii from 0750 to 1040, and Hypaurotis crysalus in late afternoon. Almost all alpine species mate all day, whereas many species of the Colorado foothills mate only part of the day. Where weather condi- tions are severe, as in the alpine zone, mating all day seems necessary to ensure mating of most females (alpine butterflies do not have low- ered temperature tolerances: Watt, 1968), whereas in areas of more favorable weather the high energy demands and increased risk of predation while males are showing conspicuous mate-locating behavior make mating in only part of the day favorable without reducing mating efficiency. Time of female emergence is also inadequate to explain mating time, since butterflies emerge in the morning within several hours after onset of light (at least 24 species are known to emerge in early morn- ing; only two emerge throughout the day). In species mating only part of the day, males spend the rest of the day feeding, except for Epargyreus clarus which hangs passively from leaves. Males of most of these species also visit flowers to a lesser extent during the mating period except for Inachis, Aglais (Baker, 1972) and Callophrys augustinus (Powell, 1968), in which feeding and dispersal occur only in the morning before the mating period. VARIATION OF MATE-LOCATING SYSTEM WITHIN SPECIES The mate-locating system of a species is usually constant through- out its range. I know of only four exceptions. Hesperia comma perches and mates on hilltops in southern Colorado, but in Marin Co., Calif., males perch only on the somewhat flat areas where larval development occurs, even when nearby ridgetops have perching H. columbia males. Celastrina argiolus males sometimes remain on hilltops in southern California (Shields, 1967) and western Texas, but never in 'Colorado in my observations or New York (A. Shapiro, pers. comm.). Euphy- dryas editha males patrol only in one colony; in another colony males often perch (Gilbert and Singer, 1972), and in a third colony males only perch (Scott, this study). Low elevation colonies of Euplhydryas anicia in the Colorado Front Range often perch on hilltops, but higher elevation colonies only patrol, even when hilltops are available (Scott, this study). Perching or patrolling behavior is usually fixed within genera, and sometimes higher taxa (Plebejini, Papilionidae and almost all Pieridae patrol). The time of day of mating is usually the same in related species of the same genus, but seems to change through evolu- tion more than does perching or patrolling behavior. The location of</page><page sequence="14">116 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 91(1) mating is often different between related species (Hesperia), and cani be different between localities within a single species due to topographic differences (for instance, the absence of hilltops in a hilltopping species). The distribution of the insect is determined mostly by factors other than male behavior (climate, predators, host-plant distribution, etc.), because females disperse widely to lay their eggs, so that the adults must manage with the mating sites available.
