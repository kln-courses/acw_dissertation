<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Abstract Peirce’s statement that “all this universe is  perfused with signs, if it is not composed  exclusively of signs” has puzzled semioti- cians as much as his dictum of matter be- ing “effete mind” has bewildered physicists  and metaphysicians. Based on Peirce’s broad 2007  concept of mind and on the presupposition  that no pure, absolute secondness or brute Presidential  reality can be found, neither in nature nor in  thought, this paper discusses a possible way Address:  to overcome the semioticians’ puzzlement  and the metaphysicians’ bewilderment. In Pervasive  the metaphysical context of synechism,  mind is synonymous with continuity; in the Semiosis logical context of semiotics it is synonymous  with semiosis. Mind is continuity and semi- Lucia Santaella osis. In the light of synechism, human mind  and physical matter are the two extremes of  a very subtle and complex range of differ- entiations along the continuous time-arrow  that constitutes nature. If mind, the one  kind of stuff in the universe, is conceived of  as semiosis, then semiotics supplies us with  concepts to guide the conjunction between  semiosis and the synechistic postulate of  continuity between mind and matter.  Keywords: Synechism, Mind, Matter,  Semiosis, Semiotics. As early as 1967, at a time when many  commentators were almost convinced that  Peirce’s thought was “merely a patchwork  of incomprehensible tendencies,” Vincent  Potter (1967 [1997]: xix) consistently ar- gued that Peirce’s work “does show consid- erable unity and that a good number of the  alleged inconsistencies are only apparent.  Large blocks of his work are remarkably  interwoven and interdependent” (ibid.: x).  Following this idea, Potter (ibid.: 3) stated  TRANSACTIONS OF THE CHARLES S. PEIRCE SOCIETY Vol. 45, No. 3 ©2009 261 </page> <page sequence="2"> that Peirce’s revision of pragmatism around 1903, brought with it the  conviction that pragmatism was inextricably linked with logic, ethics,  and aesthetics to the extent that the normative sciences get us “upon  the trail of the secret of pragmatism” (CP 5.129, 1903). “Peirce’s re- alization of the place of these sciences,” Potter concluded, “put in his  hands the capstone which unified all that he had been trying to do  more or less successfully for some forty years.” As the normative sci- ences were founded on the three universal categories, and as pragma- tism, in its turn, depended on synechism, as much as the latter was  based on Peirce’s radical realism, for Potter (ibid.: 6), the categories,  the normative sciences, pragmatism, synechism, and realism are of one  piece (Santaella 2001: 177). In my opinion, the above sequence is most coherent if we take Peirce  on his own terms, that is, if we try to understand his position from the  “inside.” This is the presupposition behind my presentation today, and  which is part of a work that I have been developing for nearly a decade.  In a paper published in 2001, I stated in five steps the main ideas that  give direction to this work in progress. These steps are: (1) Peirce’s radically anti-dualistic and evolutionary synechism has to  be taken to its ultimate consequences. According to the principles of  synechism, there is no separation or division, but there are only dif- ferences of degree between nature and culture, between the organic  and the inorganic realms, between the psychical and the physical uni- verses. (2) Peirce’s disturbing semiotic statement that “all this universe is per- fused with signs if it is not composed exclusively of signs” (CP 5.448,  n.1, 1905) can only be properly understood in the light of synechism.  (3) Peirce’s even more disturbing statement that “matter is effete  mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws” (CP 6.25, 1891) can  only be properly understood in the light of his broad concept of mind  and in the context of his theory of final causation. (4) Final causation can only be properly understood in the light of  semiosis. It is in Peirce’s classification of signs, from quasi-signs to  genuine signs that we can find the basis for the analysis of the differ- ent degrees of semiosis, ranging from the inorganic to the organic,  from the physical to the psychical realms, from protosemiosis to the  most developed form of semiosis, namely, the self-control that hu- man reason can exercise over thought and conduct. (5) Metaphysics and semiotics will appear even more deeply con- nected when we consider that Peirce’s emphasis on continuity was  vital to his evolutionary logic and pragmatism. His methodeutics,  the liveliest branch of semiotics (Santaella-Braga 1999), highlights  262 T R A N S A C T I O N S  Volume 45 Number 3 </page> <page sequence="3"> the scientific method as the prototype of final causation. That the  laws of nature are discovered by abductive inference reveals an affin- ity between the human mind and the designs of nature. Hence, the  formal laws of thought are not simply laws of our minds but laws of  the intelligibility of things. These five steps have been my working hypotheses for the develop- ment of an all-encompassing concept of semiosphere or omnipresent  semiosis which in its present state of development may be summarized  in what follows.  1. Peirce’s Insistence on Continuity In a letter to William James of 25 November, 1902 (CP 8.255–257),  in which Peirce spoke of his “completely developed system, which all  hangs together and cannot receive any proper presentation in frag- ments,” he went on to describe synechism as “the keystone of the arch”  (cf. Potter and Shields 1977: 20).  Synechism is defined, by Peirce, as “that tendency of philosophi- cal thought which insists upon the idea of continuity as of prime im- portance in philosophy” (CP 6.169, 1902). The continuum, in its  turn, is defined as “something whose possibilities of determination  no multitude of individuals can exhaust” (CP 6.170). Generality is a  rudimen tary form of continuity since “continuity is nothing but per- fect generality of a law of relationship” (CP 6.172). Metaphysics is the one science in Peirce’s architectonic classifica- tion of the sciences that inquires into the nature of the objective world  rather than into the structure of thought, as his semiotics does. This  means that there is a difference between thought and the world (Parker  1994: 52). Peirce’s synechism, however, rejects this difference as being  one of kind, but considers it instead as a difference only of degree.  Synechism has an ontological, a metaphysical, and a methodologi- cal aspect. Methodology is most closely related to semiotics, but it is  impossible to understand the relation between methodology and semi- otics without a brief description of ontology and metaphysics in the  framework of Peirce’s philosophy. 2. The Relevance of Anthropomorphic Concepts in Philosophy In “The Doctrine of Necessity Examined” (CP 6.35–6.65, 1892),  Peirce rejected the universality of the uniformity of nature and its con- sequent mechanism. Against the suggestion that the observation of na- ture proves that determinism is true, Peirce claimed that observation  merely shows that there is an element of uniformity in nature; it does  not show that such regularity is “exact and universal” (CP 6.46, 1892;  1.55, ca. 1896). “No observation or set of observations which human  beings are physically capable of making can prove that every fact is  263 2007 Presidential Address: Pervasive Semiosis  • Lucia Santaella </page> <page sequence="4"> precisely determined by law” (Cosculluela 1992: 743). In sum: facts do  not conform precisely and uniformly to law.  Peirce did not deny that there are laws in nature. On the contrary, he  asserted that laws of nature are real generals, which means that there is  an element of regularity in nature. However, in all regularities following  laws, there are always minor deviations (CP 6.59, 1892; 6.588, 1893).  Peirce’s tychism resulted from his view of an imperfect regularity of  nature provoked by “infinitesimal departures from law” with which na- ture is literally infected. The more precise our observations become, the  more likely it is that we shall encounter facts departing from laws (CP  6.46, 1892), which proves that chance is an objective feature of nature.  Hookway (1997: 18–21) remarked that, already in 1884, in “De- sign and Chance” (W4: 544–554), Peirce was aware of the occurrence  of sporadic infinitesimal violations of the laws of nature. Noticing that  chance is governed by the laws of probability calculus, he argued that  chance “has the property of being able to produce uniformities far more  strict than those from which it works” (W4: 551). His conclusion was  that “not only the laws of chemistry but the other known laws of matter  are statistical results” (ibid.), although some laws are so well established  that the deviations they do undergo are as rare and minute as to remain  unnoticed. Furthermore, in a supplement to “Design and Chance”  (W4: 553), Peirce proposed that the laws of physics may be “habits  gradually acquired by systems.” This was not the first time that he used  the anthropomorphic notion of “habits of nature” as an analogue of the  processes whereby human beings acquire habits of conduct; already in  a manuscript of 1881 entitled “Methods of Reasoning” Peirce had used  this concept, according to Hookway (1997: 20).  From 1884 onward, habits of nature became the central concept  in Peirce’s synechism at the same time that he became a defender of  the relevance of anthropomorphic concepts in philosophy. Three years  later, in “A Guess at the Riddle” (W6: 166–210), “habit taking” did  not “introduce something which is categorically distinct from law. This  tendency is itself a law which explains the evolution of laws, including  itself ” (Hookway 1997: 20). At this point, Peirce could find his expla- nation for the evolutionary character of all laws, a character that comes  from their being subject to growth and change: The tendency to obey laws has always been and will always be grow- ing. . . . Moreover, all things have a tendency to take habits. . . . This  tendency itself constitutes a regularity, and is continually on the in- crease. In looking back into the past we are looking towards periods  when it was a less and less decided tendency. But its own essential  nature is to grow. It is a generalizing tendency; it causes actions in  the future to follow some generalization of past actions; and this ten- dency is itself something capable of similar generalization; and thus,  264 T R A N S A C T I O N S  Volume 45 Number 3 </page> <page sequence="5"> it is self-generative. We have therefore only to suppose the smallest  spur of it in the past, and that germ would have been bound to de- velope into a mighty and over-ruling principle, until it supersedes  itself by strengthening habits into absolute laws regulating the action  of all things in every respect in the indefinite future. According to  this, three elements are active in the world, first, chance; second, law;  and third, habit-taking. Such is our guess at the secret of the sphynx.  (W6: 208) This guess suggests that habit taking or continuity, thirdness, is the  bridge, that is, the mediation between possibility or chance, firstness,  and actuality or operative law, secondness. Peirce’s categories should  be understood here as categories of relation and modality rather than  of substance and quality. They are neither limited within the mode of  being of possibility alone nor within the mode of an individual thing  or actual fact alone. According to synechism, there is nothing about  actuality that just is. On the one hand, actuality always retains an ele- ment of arbitrary chance, an element of sporting which disposes it to be  something other than what it is. Moreover, the law of habit prescribes  that actual events cannot escape the governance of laws. However, the  regularity of the laws are constantly being violated to some infinitesi- mal degree by the element of arbitrary chance. Hence, “in a dialectic of  becoming, actual fact or existence, secondness, is only partially real; its  destiny lies within the wider context of Thirdness” (Esposito 1973: 67).  A thoroughgoing synechistic evolutionism implies that nothing escapes  the guiding hand of habit taking or thirdness. In the light of synechism, thirdness means continuity, that is, rela- tional Thirdness, which implies the interrelation of the three categories  and their coexistence within thirdness. Thus, continuity should not be  understood as generalization fully spread out or taken to the limit of  generalization. Continuity is rather a dispositional state that infinitely  tends toward such spreading out. Continuity is only a tendency be- cause it is counteracted by the principle of discontinuity, since chance  may violate the strict determination of an event by a law of nature; this  is why laws with their dispositional propensity for habit taking evince  only approximations to absolute continuity.  3. Peirce’s Radical Anti-Dualistic Metaphysics For Peirce, a system of philosophy must be able to account for the  following essentials of the observable universe: general prevalence of  growth, variety, law, and feeling as well as consciousness (CP 6.613,  1893; Reynolds 1996: 404). As discussed above, Peirce’s synechistic  idea of habits of nature as a complementary opposite to chance en- abled him to account for growth, variety, and the laws of nature. A  deeper clarification of these issues would require a discussion of Peirce’s  265 2007 Presidential Address: Pervasive Semiosis  • Lucia Santaella </page> <page sequence="6"> concept of final and efficient causation, which cannot be presented  here. Thus, I will proceed straight to the fourth issue, consciousness or  feeling in the universe. Peirce vehemently rejected any dualistic sepa- ration of consciousness and matter as it would betray his synechism,  prescribing a thoroughgoing evolutionism and, consequently, a radical  anti-dualism. To suppose that dead matter was capable of feeling was a  rather improbable hypothesis. How could Peirce find a way out of this  dilemma? Faced with a choice between Cartesian dualism and some variety  of monism, Peirce argued that philosophy should adopt the latter.  However, there are three possible directions in which monism can be  developed: (a) neutralism, which takes physical and psychical laws as  independent of each other, assuming that both stem from a third Urst- off; (b) materialism, which takes the psychical laws to be derived from  the physical, and (c) idealism, which takes the physical as derived from  the psychical (CP 6.24, 1891). Occam’s razor made Peirce reject neu- tralism, and his first principle of scientific thought—that is, do not  resort to the ultimate and inexplicable as an explanation—led him to  reject materialism. Objective idealism remains as the only rational al- ternative: matter is effete mind (Potter 1997: 133). If matter is effete mind and physical laws are derived from psychical  ones, there is only one kind of stuff in the universe, and that is mind.  The great law of the universe is the one of mind. Now, what is the law  of mind? “Logical analysis applied to mental phenomena shows that  there is but one law of mind, namely, that ideas tend to spread continu- ously and to affect certain others which stand to them in a peculiar rela- tion of affectibility. In this spreading they lose intensity, and especially  the power of affecting others, but gain generality and become welded  with other ideas” (CP 6.104, 1892). The process of the spreading of  ideas is evidence of the tendency towards generalization and towards  forming associations, which is also the tendency to form habits, which  is itself a habit (cf. CP 6.612, 1893):  But no mental action seems to be necessary or invariable in its  character. In whatever manner the mind has reacted under a given  sensation, in that manner it is more likely to react again; were this,  however, an absolute necessity, habits would become wooden and  ineradicable and, no room being left for the formation of new habits,  intellectual life would come to a speedy close. Thus, the uncertainty  of the mental law is no mere defect of it, but on the contrary its es- sence. (CP 6.148, 1892) The law of mind is the prototypical dispositional state of continuity  or thirdness, the realm of final causation. What Peirce found in nature  as well as in thought is the general tendency towards the occurrence of  266 T R A N S A C T I O N S  Volume 45 Number 3 </page> <page sequence="7"> chance events turning into sequences that eventually become habits.  Dynamism and growth are the results of this relational generality. The  prototype of this tendency is the human mind associating ideas analo- gously to the probabilistic laws of nature (Hulswit 2000: 7).  In the omnipresent occurrence of chance, Peirce saw a rudiment of  consciousness in nature, the effects of chance in physical nature corre- sponding to the effects of feeling in human life. With the extension of  the notion of habit taking from the domain of chemistry and physics  to the world of psychical laws, Peirce’s synechism accomplishes a radical  extension of the theory of evolution. Hence, Peirce’s psychical monism, or objective idealism, is not just  an inversion of the physicalist conception of mind, according to which  psychical states are simply a kind of physical state. What Peirce asserts  is that all of reality is determined by the law of mind, which operates in  an infinite series of differentiations. This does not mean that matter is  of the substance of mind—neither “substance” in the ancient sense of a  “thing” nor in its modern chemical sense. In sum:  The truth is, the mind is not subject to “law” in the same rigid sense  that matter is. It only experiences gentle forces which merely render it  more likely to act in a given way than otherwise would be. There al- ways remains a certain amount of arbitrary spontaneity in its action,  without which it would be dead. (CP 6.148, 1892)  By contrast, what we call matter is merely mind so “hidebound with  habit,” so regular, that it ceases to exhibit the behavior of spontaneity  and feeling, which is so abundant in mind (CP 6.25, 1891; Reynolds  1996: 405–406). While mind is anarchic, matter is law abiding.  For Peirce synechism bridges the gap between matter and mind be- cause when we suppose  matter to be but mind under the slavery of inveterate habits, the law  of mind still applies to it. According to that law, consciousness sub- sides as habit becomes established, and is excited again at the break- ing up of habit. But the highest quality of mind involves a great  readiness to take habits, and a great readiness to lose them; and this  implies a degree of feeling neither very intense nor very feeble. (CP  6.613, 1893)  In sum: matter is mind,  whose habits have become fixed so as to lose the powers of form- ing them and losing them, while mind is to be regarded as a chemi- cal genus of extreme complexity and instability. It has acquired in  a remarkable degree a habit of taking and laying aside habits. The  fundamental divergences from law must here be most extraordinarily  267 2007 Presidential Address: Pervasive Semiosis  • Lucia Santaella </page> <page sequence="8"> high, although probably very far indeed from attaining any directly  observable magnitude. But their effect is to cause the laws of mind to  be themselves of so fluid a character as to simulate divergences from  law. (CP 6.101, 1892) Matter, on the other hand, “is not completely dead, but is merely  mind hidebound with habits. It still retains the element of diversifica- tion; and in that diversification there is life” (CP 6.158, 1892). From  this presence of mind in matter, and vice versa, Peirce infers the direct  and indirect connections between matter and mind, between the physi- cal and psychical aspects of matter, and the interrelations between mind  and matter (cf. CP 6.268, 1892 and CP 6.277, ca. 1893). Attributing to  mind one of the properties of matter, namely, extension, and to all mat- ter “a certain low degree of feeling together with a certain power of tak- ing habits,” Peirce’s hypothesis may be called materialistic. However, it  differs from materialism because it does not suppose mind to be guided  by blind mechanical law. Instead, it supposes “the one original law to be  the recognized law of mind, the law of association, of which the laws of  matter are regarded as mere special results” (CP 6.277, ca. 1893). In the light of synechism, human mind and physical matter are the  two extremes of a very subtle and complex range of differentiations  in the continuous time-arrow that constitutes nature. Peirce took the  time-arrow principle of mind as paradigmatic of any evolutionary pro- cess, whether in mind or in nature. What he sought was a definition of  an irreversible process that was sufficiently abstract in both the domains  of the mental and of the physical. Thus, mind has to be understood  in a very broad sense. In the metaphysical context of synechism, it is  synonymous with continuity; in the logical context of semiotics it is  synonymous with semiosis. Mind is continuity and semiosis.  4. Synechism and Semiosis If in nature, secondness is law and thirdness is the tendency to acquire  new habits, pure, absolute secondness or brute reality can be found  neither in nature nor in thought. This insight is the prerequisite for  the understanding of why “all this universe is perfused with signs, if  it is not composed exclusively of signs” (CP 5.448, fn., 1905). This  so frequently quoted statement concerning the ubiquity of signs has  puzzled semioticians as much as Peirce’s dictum of matter being “effete  mind” has bewildered physicists and metaphysicians who mistook it for  an affirmation concerning some mysterious ghostly substance lurking  behind natural processes.  My own proposal to overcome the semioticians’ puzzlement and  the metaphysicians’ bewilderment has been that the solution lies in the  ubiquity of synechism, understood in light of Peirce’s broad concept of  mind, within the context of the theory of final causality.  268 T R A N S A C T I O N S  Volume 45 Number 3 </page> <page sequence="9"> In a paper published in Cognitio, I discussed the positions assumed  by a number of semioticians, positions which, as far as I can see, are still  Cartesian in their fundamentally dualist assumptions. In their inter- pretations of the Peircean dynamic object, these semioticians maintain  the claim of a nonsemiotic realm in order to preserve the explanatory  power of the concept of the sign. With such claims for an independent  world of dyadic existence, these scholars not only neglect Peirce’s prin- ciple of synechism, but they also succeed in remaining faithful to their  ingrained Cartesian premises. A convincing argument against the prevailing dualisms was sug- gested by Kloesel, in his paper “Ethics, Optics, Whist, and Wine—and  the Semiotic of C. S. Peirce” (1991), in which he discusses the rela- tion between semiotics and metaphysics, signs and the order of nature,  as well as culture and nature. According to Kloesel, the similarity be- tween the processes in nature and the processes of thought sheds light  on the relation between semiotics and metaphysics. Kloesel’s thesis is  that, although semiotic concepts (let alone the word “semiotics” itself )  do not even appear in Peirce’s metaphysical writings, his evolutionary  metaphysics is nevertheless founded upon the theory of signs. It is the  general law of mental action that guides the evolutionary stages of mat- ter, life, and human thought and intelligence. When Peirce assumed  the continuity of that law in his evolutionary metaphysics, he based all  his philosophy on the development of sign processes (ibid.: 124–25).  Growth, continuity, the generalizing tendency, and the growing  complexity of ideas, the most important characteristics of the law of  mind, are the key concepts providing insights into the nature of the  relationship between semiotics and metaphysics: “Like the law of mind  (or of mental action), the sign process (or semiosis or the process of sign  action, which includes the mental interpretant) is marked by growth,  continuity, and increasing complexity” (ibid.: 129). Thus, “the devel- opment of the world corresponds, to a large degree, to the form and  development of sign processes” (ibid.: 131). Furthermore, “in the move from semiotic to metaphysics, whether  and how signs reflect and define the structure of reality, signs do enable  us to examine and understand the relation between mind and matter”  (ibid.: 130). Unfortunately, when Kloesel equates mind to signs and  matter to objects, he falls back into a dualism that is essentially incom- patible with Peirce’s synechistic principle of continuity.  To avoid all pitfalls of dualism, the path I have been following has  its starting point in the concept of final causation, which I consider  as a bridge from semiotics to metaphysics and vice-versa. Considering  the complexity of the construction of this bridge, I will limit myself  to a brief discussion of some of Peirce’s metaphysical statements based  on his account of the continuity of processes of semiosis. At the same  time, synechism has to be conceived of as a key to the understanding  269 2007 Presidential Address: Pervasive Semiosis  • Lucia Santaella </page> <page sequence="10"> of Peirce’s statement that the universe is perfused with signs (CP 5.448,  fn.1, 1905).  5. Interrelations of Semiotics and Metaphysics To postulate a mutual interrelation between semiotics and metaphysics  does not mean to ignore the fundamental differences between both. As  discussed above, semiotics, founded on ethics which is in turn founded  on aesthetics, investigates the structure of thought, while metaphysics  investigates the structure of the objective world. However, if we take  into consideration that the great law of the universe is the law of mind,  which is a law explaining not only the evolution of thought but also  the one of the universe, we will see that semiosis is a logical process  able to explain some of the most crucial metaphysical issues. As Peirce  d eclared, “Continuity represents Thirdness almost to perfection,” while  “the easiest idea [of Thirdness] of philosophical interest is the idea of  a sign, or representation” (CP 1.337, ca. 1875; and 1.339, ca. 1895).  If this is so, then the logical process of semiosis is a secure path to an  understanding of the most perfect and complex form of thirdness, namely,  continuity, the central concept of synechism. That is why one can make  little sense of those interpretations of semiosis which still try to maintain  a sharp frontier between the semiotic universe of signs on the one hand  and the non-semiotic universe of objects on the other. Defense against  this frontier can be obtained from the extension of the law of mind to  the physiological realm. Peirce professed that “biological organisms, and  especially a nervous system, are favorably conditioned for exhibiting the  phenomena of mind” (CP 7.364, 1902), which gives support to the idea  of a fundamental equivalence between elements of conscience and its  physiological counterpart: “The cloudiness of psychological notions may  be corrected by connecting them with physiological conceptions,” wrote  Peirce (CP 6.22, 1891). Hence, the notions of feeling, sense of reaction,  and habit formation are also relevant to the study of nervous cells.  In his evolutionary philosophy, Peirce advanced even more when he  postulated the continuity between the physical and the psychical realms  because of their similarities, despite their differences, in the frequency  and intensity of their modes of transformation, change, and becoming.  Feelings, efforts, and habits are more familiar to us at their psychical  side, but they are also omnipresent at their physical side as chance,  law, and tendency (CP 6.201–2, 1898). In fact, if the three catego- ries are omnipresent and interrelated (CP 5.436, 1905; 7.532, n.d.),  thirdness must not be considered apart from secondness and firstness.  Chance corresponds to the external aspect of what feeling is internally  (CP 6.265, 1892).  At this point, Peirce’s argument convinces that secondness is law  and thirdness the tendency to acquire new habits. As discussed above,  there is nothing about actuality that just is. In light of a conception of  270 T R A N S A C T I O N S  Volume 45 Number 3 </page> <page sequence="11"> nature and the physical world in which secondness corresponds to an  operative law, there can be no argument to sustain the thesis of those  semioticians that locate the dynamic object of the sign in a nonsemiotic  realm. Besides having no support in Peirce’s metaphysics, this view of  the sign also ignores that semiotics supplies us with concepts to guide  the conjunction between semiosis and the synechist postulate of conti- nuity between mind and matter.  Concerning the methodological aspects of synechism, it is worth  advancing the idea that without a scientific metaphysics, semiotics  lacks a theory of the external world as well as one of cosmic evolution.  Such lack has led semioticians to confound the dynamic object of hu- man semiosis with brute, formless reality, external to our sense percep- tion. Approaches to semiotics misled by this assumption ignore that  nature has a semiosis of its own to which human semiosis is connected  through the thread of continuity and affinity. The processes of nature  and of thought are alike (Hookway 1997: 20), as Peirce underlines:  “There is in the being of things something which corresponds to the  process of reasoning, that the world lives and moves, and has its being,  in a logic of events” (NEM 4: 343–5, 1898). Grounding semiotics in phenomenology allowed Peirce to extend  the notion of sign to phenomena that are no longer inherently triadic  but can nevertheless function as a sign, albeit in a “degenerate” way.  This extension and the manifold mixtures of types of signs in which it  results, requires a more detailed investigation of the correspondences  inherent in the continuity between matter and mind. A more detailed  study of the degrees of semiotic degeneracy, apparent in the typology  of signs, promises insight into how semiosis gradually evolves from  the physical to the psychical realm, from the inorganic to the organic  world, and from nature to culture.
