      <p>Stephen Harp’s <italic>Marketing Michelin: Advertising and Cultural Identity in Twentieth‐Century France</italic> accomplishes the difficult task of melding business and cultural history to make a persuasive argument for the critical role of large corporations in the shaping of national culture in the first half of the twentieth century. In fascinating and nuanced chapters, Harp relates the Michelin brothers’ commitment to, and investment in, such diverse domains as bicycle, car, and airplane racing; tourism; gastronomy; aviation; and pronatalism. <italic>Marketing Michelin</italic> is, therefore, both more and less ambitious than its title would imply. It is about far more than the company’s influence through its strategies for publicizing and distributing its goods, but, aside from the book’s conclusion, the story ends before the Second World War.</p>
      <p>In one of his most engaging chapters, Harp suggests that the anthropomorphic creature devised for Michelin’s visual publicity, Bibendum—better known in English as the “Michelin man”—both built on and contributed to conventional understandings of class, gender, and race in twentieth‐century France. Bibendum was definitively marked—by his expensive and masculine accoutrements (pince‐nez, rings, cigar), size (huge), and color (pale, despite the grayness or blackness of the tires of which he was composed)—as an upper‐class white male. Given the lack of access to most of the company’s internal archives, Harp cannot tell us much about the decision‐making process behind the creation of the Michelin man. I find, however, the suggestions that Bibendum’s gender was very consciously plotted, and contributed to the making of stereotypes rather than merely to their reproduction, more persuasive than such claims for either his class attribution or his racial identification.</p>
      <p>From the late nineteenth century through the interwar period, the markets for both of Michelin’s prime products—bicycle and then car tires—were limited, by their expense, to the very rich. (Harp cites the rather astonishing fact that in 1901 a bicycle tire cost ninety‐nine francs at a time when a provincial laborer was earning three francs a day [p. 20].) Since the company could not hope to cut costs enough to make its products widely accessible, it made sense to emphasize their eliteness. While a figure used to advertise an upper‐class consumer good in pre–World War II France could have been male or female, it could not have been anything other than white. I would like to suggest that, rather than working evenly across the three social fields, Michelin’s visual advertising necessarily reproduced existing conceptions of class and race but freely chose to reinforce a traditional gender order. Harp convincingly argues that bicycles and cars had no “natural” gender; they were new inventions and, in fact, through their association with leisure rather than production were susceptible to a feminine gendering. By designing the icon of the French car industry as not only definitively male but also as either towering physically over the occasional women depicted or “winning” them outright, Michelin helped to define bicycles and cars as masculine goods. This observation demonstrates the power of cultural norms in the economic domain: it would appear that Édouard and André Michelin’s sense of appropriate gender roles took precedence over their desire to sell the maximum number of tires. Harp demonstrates well that the company systematically tried to project an image of itself as modern; it would have therefore been possible for the company to run an ad campaign that underscored its modernity through advocacy of gender equality. But as the nature of their support for pronatalism indicates, that was not a cause the Michelin brothers could endorse. Instead, the company chose to risk limiting its profits by reinforcing conservative gender norms and constructing its market as exclusively masculine. It was not, however, only through the deployment of Bibendum that Michelin shaped French cultural life.</p>
      <p>Harp demonstrates in persuasive detail that the company’s creative efforts to increase the market for tires played a fundamental role in the development of modern automobile tourism with the good roads, signs, guides, and maps it requires and the attendant transformation of French cooking into gastronomy, with its accompanying culture of wine connoisseurship. Thus, as early as 1900, Michelin adapted existing guidebooks for the purposes of automobile tourists, producing the ancestor of the now ubiquitous “Red Guides” to hotels and restaurants in France, upon whose notice and ratings establishments rise or fall. Shortly thereafter, the company started publishing road maps more truly adequate for the early motorist and contributed signs marking the entry to and exit from any town in France whose mayor was willing to accept them. In 1913, the national government yielded to pressure from Michelin (and others) and implemented a roadway numbering system so drivers could for the first time know what road they were actually on. Finally, Harp effectively argues that the Michelin brothers and the Michelin company shaped and reflected not only social categorizations and French cartography and signage but also the state’s political agenda, including the representation of World War I.</p>
      <p>One of the great strengths of this book is its complex depiction of Édouard and André Michelin, who emerge both as fantastically successful industrialists and as men driven by passions and preoccupations that had little to do with either rubber or profits. André had the stronger passion for aviation, but both were equally engaged in the regeneration of France through increased births there, and they were willing to support their causes generously. For example, Michelin’s contribution to the dominant pronatalist organization, the Alliance Nationale pour l’Accroissement de la Population Français, for the year 1920 was as large as that of the French government, and the firm played a key role in the development of aviation in the interwar period (p. 138). Of course, carefully constructed as patriotic investments, support for these causes did attract positive publicity for the firm, but Harp is persuasive that this was not the Michelin brothers’ primary motivation. Likewise, the production and sale of guidebooks to the battlefields of the First World War (the first of which appeared in 1913!) served a triple function: they raised money for the pronatalist cause (all profits went to the Alliance Nationale), they offered a forum for a particular (revanchist) interpretation of the war, and they provided good publicity for the firm.</p>
      <p>By the end of the book, the reader is persuaded by Harp’s initial insistence that human agency matters in history and that the actions of industrialists can play a critical role in shaping, or at least, reproducing, national culture. <italic>Marketing Michelin</italic> gives body and substance to the often abstract arguments presented by cultural historians on the importance of “capital” in the making of social and cultural categories.</p>
      <p>One is left wondering, however, if a similar story could be told of industrialists and firms whose heyday came after World War II, in an age of global rather than multinational capitalism. The nature of business and of the French state both changed radically after that war; privately held companies such as Michelin could no longer control national markets, to say nothing of competing internationally, and the welfare state of the second half of the twentieth century left less space for publicity through philanthropy.</p>
