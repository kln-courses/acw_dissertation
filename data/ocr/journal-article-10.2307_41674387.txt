<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS Archaeology in the USSR We are continuing our all too brief re- ports of archaeological finds made in the Soviet Union published in Archae- ology 23 (1970) 156-160. Again we thank the Novosti Press Agency for pro- viding us with the information of these many impressive and important finds. Old Stone Age Palaeolithic remains have been found throughout Uzbekistan indicating a homogeneous culture existed in this area in the early Stone Age. Stone im- plements 100,000 years old were found at two points on the Zirabulak River near Gharkhin Village. Another Palaeolithic site has been recently dis- covered on the Kuturbulak River in the Paiaryk area, and in Obirakhmat grotto, one of the largest Palaeolithic sites in the Soviet Union, habitation layers 40,000 years of age were revealed. The grotto, a shell-like niche in a limestone cliff, measures forty feet in height and seventy feet in width. It lies about sixty miles from Tashkent in the spurs of the Koksui Mountains at an altitude of 4100 feet. Discovered several years ago with the help of a local beekeeper, the grotto was first excavated by Mikhail Gerasimov, a well known Soviet anthropologist, archaeologist and sculptor. Recently excavations were re- sumed by his pupil, Rustam Suleimanov. The thirty-two feet of accumulated material in the cave can be divided into twenty-one culture layers, the lower of which belongs to a well-developed Mousterian culture. Moving upwards the artifacts reflect the slow but steady development of Neanderthal man into his modern descendant - the tools be- come less bulky and more elegant, sophisticated and varied. Exploration of only a fifth of the layers has revealed thousands of objects. Most are stòne and include knives, pointed tools, spin- ning and scraping implements, wood- cutters and planes. Two blocks of siliceous limestone, "nuclei" from which pieces of limestone were chipped, dem- onstrate that tools were actually made inside the grotto. Future excavations can be expected to bring to light many discoveries. In June 1970 Kiev archaeologists fin- ished classifying the remains of animals bagged about 30,000 years ago by late palaeolithic hunters settled on the Desna River. Here the hunters from a settlement numbering in total 50-60 people succeeded in downing 116 mam- moths, 3 rhinoceroi, 5 bison, 63 wild horses, 1 giant reindeer, 83 northern reindeer, 17 musk-oxen and numerous brown bears, gluttons, wolves, polar 57</page><page sequence="2">The front and side views of a late palaeolithic house made of mammoth bones. It was unearthed in the Ukraine at the village of Mezhirich and is now on exhibit in Kiev. These bone implements were found in Mezhirich during the excavation of a bone house : (Left) a bone scraper for processing leather, length, ca. 25 cm.; (Right) bait sticks for traps, preserved lengths, 4.8 and 10.5 cm. Stylized female figurine, height, 13.8 cm. foxes, hares and other wild animals. These hunters, unlike their modern counterparts, made complete use of their victims: the meat was eaten, the bones and skins made tents and the tusks and horns became decorative objects. Late Palaeolithic Bone Houses Ivan Pidoplichko, the Director of the Institute of Zoology of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences has reconstructed bone houses uncovered at a site near the village of Mezhirich, a hundred miles southeast of Kiev. When the site was accidently discovered in 1965 by a local farmer, members of the Institute of Zoology rushed there and immedi- ately found several mammoth jaws, each inserted into another. Excavations be- gan the next summer. Pidoplichko used the stripping technique of excavation in which one layer of the entire 570 square meter area was revealed at a time. He was thus able to obtain evi- dence to support his belief that the material did not represent an accumu- lation of hunted animals but were the remains of a settlement in which the houses themselves were constructed en- tirely of mammoth bones. One dwelling completely uncovered was circular and covered an exterior area of 466 square feet and an interior space of 247 square feet. Its socle con- sisted of mammoth skulls with the lower jaws acting as protective facings. The frame was made of poles and different bones, i.e. pelvic bones and shoulder blades as well as the skulls of young animals. The roof had over three dozen tusks and poles. These massive bones assured the strength and longevity of the frame. Hide coverings kept the heat in and protected against the cold and wind. In total, 385 bones from at least 95 mammoths were used in the construction of this dwelling. The re- mains were removed to the Zoology Institute's Paleontological Museum where the structure has been recon- structed and put on exhibition. The initial identification of the build- ing as a cult structure was refuted by its finds. Almost at its center was a hearth with an ash layer up to eight inches thick. A device used for fixing a crossbar over the fire was found nearby. Small objects included tools, ornaments, often of amber, and a few bone figurines. Hundreds of flint flakes, either finished or prepared to be fin- ished, had belonged to knives, cutters and scrapers. Two fragments of mam- moth-tusk spear points, a hammer of reindeer horň, many bone awls and a bone needle were also retrieved. A drawing, problably a symbolic repre- sentation of fire, adorned the forepart of a mammoth skull. The drawing consisted of broken lines arranged like a bush coming from a single point. Between the lines (flames?) were small round points (sparks?). On the basis of several methods for determining the age of bones - the col- lagene method for non-weathered bones and the accumulation of the talus layer - Pidoplichko concluded the structure was 5-6000 years old. On the assumption that more houses lay in the vicinity, 350 boreholes were drilled over a surrounding two and a half acre area. A second structure, forty feet from the first, and perhaps three more were found. In the summer of 1970, the second structure was ex- vacated. Its frame, also of mammoth bones, contained over 400 large bones from at least thirty-three animals. Smaller than the first, this dwelling used flat and tubular bones, not lower jaw bones, for its outer cover. Among the finds were flint pieces, hammers of reindeer horn, awls, bone needles, spear points, a mammoth tusk spear, bone guards for hunting traps, bones with geometric designs, anthropomorphic figures and pieces of amber. These dwellings and finds indicate the site was a place of permanent hab- itation. The evi- dence also sug- gests that mam- moths may have become extinct. 58</page><page sequence="3">Kemal jshev , head of the Archaeology De- par tm at the Kazakh Academy of Sciences, stud; i he find from a Saka burial.

The majority of these were im- mature and such mass annihilation of the young of these animals which multi- plied slowly was probably responsible for the destruction of the entire species. This evidence also shows, once more, the insolvency of the theory that glaciers extended over the northern temperate zone, for a study of the contemporary flora and fauna indicate the climate in this area differed little from that of today. Neolithic and Bronze Age For five years Byelorussian archaeolo- gists have been excavating a Neolithic site (fifth- third millennium b.c.) near the village of Kamen in Polesya. Horse, cow and goat fossils found here indi- cate that these people kept domestic ani- mals 3000-1000 years earlier than had previously been thought. A portrait gallery of people who lived 3500 years ago is being constructed by Andranik Dzhagaryan, a prominent Ar- menian surgeon and head of the De- partment of Operative Surgery and Topographic Anatomy at the Yerevan Medical Institute. When the waters of Lake Sevan started retreating to bare parts of its bottom, Armenian achaeologists uncov- ered the ruins of an ancient fortress and extensive burials of the fourteenth cen- tury b.c., located in the area of Lchas- hen village. Some of the graves, prob- ably those of the chiefs, contained wooden chariots, gold and bronze orna- ments in addition to weapons and do- mestic articles. Professor Dzhagaryan was called in to find out what these people looked like. For several months Professor Dzha- garyan conducted extensive roentgeno- logical investigations on more than 200 skulls, studied the bone structure and compared the results with the structure of the skulls of the present-day local population. He also investigated the causes of death and discovered that in the burials with war chariots, all the skele- tons, except one (the chief?) had a characteristic fracture of the neck verte- brae, an indication of violent death. The killing of servants with a de- ceased master must have been cus- tomary among these people. After studying the bone and skull structures, Professor Dzhagaryan could restore the head by gradually recreating the musculature of the face. He con- cluded that anthropological elements of these ancients are retained by the pres- ent-day inhabitants of the Armenian highlands, indicating their ancestors had lived in this area for at least 3500 years. Saka Burial An ancient Saka burial mound of the fifth-fourth century b.c. was excavated near the settlement of Issyk, twenty-five miles from Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan. The grave, built of well preserved Tien Shan spruce, contained the remains of an eighteen-year-old warrior. He was dressed in a gilt-em- broidered costume and accompanied by nearly 400 gold objects. In addition, ceramic, silver and bronze vessels were found under the mound. These finds, all original works of art, indicate the existence of ethnic and culture ties be- tween the Saka tribes and the Iranian tribes of Persia. Scythian Burial An expedition undertaken in 1969 by the Archaeology Institute of the Acad- emy of Sciences of the Ukrainian USSR uncovered an important treasure in a grave located on the outskirts of the village of Zaporozhye. There a tumulus, known locally as the "Gaimonova Grave," had been built by the Scythians in the fourth century b.c. Eight meters below the top of the tumulus was a burial chamber with entrances on the east and west. In clearing the western entrance, the archaeologists found a passage previously dug by robbers, in which were disturbed human bones, arrow and spearheads and articles of iron and bronze. Because of the possi- bility of a cave-in, professional miners from a nearby iron works were called in to help clear the undisturbed areas of the burial chamber. The skeletons of two slaves, a horse with a bronze bridle and a wine amphora were found by the eastern entrance. At the foot of the northern wall a downfall of earth had preserved the leg bones of a buried woman, with the remains of leather shoes decorated with forty-three gold triangular plates. In all, more than 200 gold ornaments - pendants for neck- laces and decorative plates - all skill- fully wrought in the Scythian animal style, were scattered throughout the chamber. During excavations a heavy shower caused the chamber's already fragile walls to collapse, thus necessitating a 59</page><page sequence="4">A large silver cup from a Scythian grave.

As Boris Mazolevsky, assistant to the head of the expedition, patiently removed layers of stamped clay to again reach the floor, a small hole, some two inches in dia- meter, opened under his knife. Soon metal was glittering, a sign that here was a treasure trove, always exciting in archaeological work. It took eighteen hours of continuous work to clean the pit. On top was a silver vessel with long handles. Beneath it lay a care- fully worked silver rhyton (drinking horn). Plain gold plate with a decorated border covered the wider end while an exquisitely worked gold ram's head terminated the narrower one. Next to these vessels lay eight gold plates, which, in turn, covered another silver rhyton, twice as large as the first. Its gold bell- shaped mouth has a stylized image of a deer's head and the opposite end was formed by a lion's head with an opened mouth and tousled mane. To the right lay a silver jug decorated with geo- metric patterns. On the rhyton's other side at the bottom of the pit, was a large silver cup with flat horizontal handles, and inside it - a small silver cup. Of these sensational finds, the large cup is the most interesting because it is decorated with scenes from Scythian military life. In the center are two elderly warriors with broad beards and neatly trimmed hair. They wear narrow trousers, decorated with metal plates, short boots fastened with ankle straps and long caftans trimmed with fur and embroidered on the shoulders. Beside them are their bows and arrows and a sword with a fancy handle and scabbard. Their hands and faces are made of silver, while the clothes, boots, weapons and background are covered with gold. These two figures are probably mili- tary commanders conducting negotia- tions. On the opposite side of the vase, the same warriors appear with arms outstretched to one another, probably in the act of sealing an agreement. Under the handles are the images of slaves bearing gifts, a wineskin and a goose. The subject of the frieze is origi- nal and supplements similar depictions discovered in royal Scythian mounds at Solokh, Kul-Oba and Voronezh. All these vases, outstanding examples of ancient metal work, are being restored at the Hermitage Museum in Lenin- grad and will be placed in the Kiev Museum of Historical Valuables. Sarmatian Gold Treasure Another gold treasure, consisting pri- marily of jewelry, was found in a tumulus grave on the Russian steppes near the Volga River. The woman, buried with her child, was a Sarma- tian, who lived about the third cen- tury b.c. As part of an archaeological survey under the direction of Albert N. Melentyev of the USSR Institute of Archaeology, the site of a new irri- gation system was investigated and this mound was excavated. The jewelry, now in Moscow, included two heavy coiled spiral gold bracelets, one with twelve coils, decorated with stylized heads of rams or saigas; a pair of ear- rings consisting of small gold discs with five-petalled rosettes in relief and framed by gold bands; and several thick fantastically twisted gold rods, probably half-finished objects. Other finds from the area and even the same mound illustrate the daily life and material culture of these ancient nomadic tribes. They include bronze cauldrons, cera- mics, weapons, beads and ornaments as well as bronze mirrors. The survey which will be undertaken for several more years, will cover vast territories of the northeastern portion of the Caspian region, particularly desert and semi-desert areas, never be- fore visited by archaeologists. Moscow In 1969 an exhibit of relics found on the Borovitsky Hill during the last decade was set up in the Annunciation Cathedral in the Kremlin. Prehistoric artifacts include various stone objects and ceramics of the Dyakovo culture, named after an upper Iron Age site on the Moscow River. Although literary records place the founding of Moscow in the middle of the twelfth century after Christ, recent archaeological discoveries indicate an urban settlement with dwellings and auxiliary buildings existed on Borovitsky Hill at an earlier time. In 1080 the hill was crossed by a wooden street. There is also evidence for early fortifi- cations consisting of a rampart, timber walls and gates, predating the major fortifications built in the middle of the 12 th century by Andrei Bogolyub- sky, the son of the city's traditional founder, Prince Yuri Volodimerich. A lead stamp from Kiev, dated by its stylistic and technical details to a.D. 1091-1096 shows Moscow's importance at that time. Other later objects, recording the history of the city, have been found due to careful excavation. At a depth of thirteen feet, an arrowhead was found, a witness to ancient fighting at the walls. A pine framework dates to 60</page><page sequence="5">(Above) The boat on which the voyage to the site of Mangazea was made is moored in the Taz River whose waters once washed the banks of this 17 -century city.

Russian cloth woven in tne twelfth century after Christ. a.D. 1221. Twelfth and thirteenth cen- tury layers provided ceramics, glass bracelets and fragments of glass vessels. Magnificent fabrics, strikingly orna- mented and colored, were found in a grave of the twelfth century. The thir- teenth and fourteenth centuries are represented by tombstones, jewelry, ar- rowheads, spurs and various iron ob- jects including keys, knives and lamps. Among the exhibits are textiles dating to the end of the thirteenth and be- ginning of the fourteenth century. A display of leather includes a woman's shoe worn at the end of the twelfth céntury and a man's boot of the sev- enteenth century. Some discoveries are exceptionally im- portant for they prove that part of Cathedral Square in the Kremlin existed before the structures ordered by Ivan Kalita in the fourteenth century, supposedly the first buildings of the Kremlin. Remnants of a white stone church probably date to the thirteenth century. The "Oaken city of Moscow" erected by Kalita was destroyed by a terrible fire in 1365. Soon new white stone walls were erected which stood more than a hundred years until they were replaced by newer and more sumptuous structures. A Buried City of the 17th Century In September 1970, three years of excavation was completed on the site of Mangazea, a seventeenth century city in the northern part of the Tyumen Region between the Ob and Yenisei Rivers. Built by Russian traders and the troops of Czar Boris Godunov, the city played an outstanding role in the con- quest of Siberia. After seventy years it was abandoned when the Czar ordered the troops to settle elsewhere. The city's defense structures, the governor's court, the town hall, three churches and one chapel were unearthed, as well as the main commercial buildings and several workshops. The large trading center, a two storey building near the eastern wall of the fortress was of great importance. Here Russian merchants, native Nenets and representatives of Western European trading houses came to trade, the primary item being fur. A lead stamp with the inscription "Am- sterdam and other trading houses" was found at the center, indicating the fa- mous Dutch trading company bought Russian sables in Mangazea. This last year the palace of the gov- ernor Andrei Palitsyn was discovered and studied. A large structure, it spread over an area of more than 4,300 square feet and was built in Western style. Palitsyn had lived in Poland as the czar's ambassador for many years. Among the finds from the palace was a beautiful man's silver ring, and table knives with ivory handles. The site of new Mangazea on the Yenisei River was also investigated and future explorations are planned for other sites in the area. Restoration of Ukrainian Villages Valuable specimens of Ukrainian folk life and architecture are being pre- served and restored in the picturesque Shevchenko Woods. Here an outdoor ethnographic museum of the villages of Polesye, Volyn, Gutsulshchina, Boi- kovshchina, Lemkovshchina, Podolye, the Lvov area, and Bukovina is being set up. A farmstead will be the heart of each ethnographic group which will in- clude a dwelling house and auxiliary farm buildings with implements, tools and vehicles. 61</page><page sequence="6">(Above) A restored church fence, 1746, from Gutsulschchina, West Ukraine. (Below) Restored watermill from Boi- kovshchina , West Ukraine . The Boikovshchina village is now being reconstructed and includes an oil mill, a water mill, a peasant's hut with a chimneyless oven (1812), a 1792 hut with a gallery, an 1846 hut, a nine- teenth century stable and an eighteenth century chapel. These buildings have been moved from Boikovshchina and will stand near a 1763 church from the Carpathians. An eighteenth cen- tury church from Bukovina stands to the north of it. Buildings from the other villages will be moved to the museum. A New Institute of Archaeology We close this report with a notice of the creation, in October 1970, of the Institute of Archaeology at the Uzbek Academy of Sciences under the direc- tion of Dr. A. A. Askarov. The institute is divided into several sections : the Stone and Bronze Age, antique and mediaeval archaeology, the history of irrigation, a museum of Samarkand his- tory and two research laboratories, par- « ticularly interested in problems of restoration. One of its first tasks is to compile a catalog of archaeological monuments all over the republic of Uzbekistan, a project of great import- ance to further exploration in this region.</page></plain_text>
