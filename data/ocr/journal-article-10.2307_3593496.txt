<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEFF GATRALL Between Iconoclasm and Silence: Representing the Divine in Holbein and Dostoevskii 1. Representing the Divine in Modernity On his way from Baden to Geneva in August, 1867, Dostoevskii stopped at Basel, where he viewed Hans Holbein the Younger's 1521 painting "The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb." In her memoirs, Anna Grigorevna recounts leav- ing her husband alone and returning fifteen to twenty minutes later to find him "riveted to the spot" before it: "in his agitated face there was a kind of frightened expression, one which I had happened to notice more than once in the first minutes of an epileptic fit." Afterwards Dostoevskii would declare to his wife that "one could lose one's faith from that picture" ("ot takoi kartiny vera mozhet propast'") (Anna Dostoevskaia 175, 437) . Besides this cryptic comment, repeated later by Myshkin in The Idiot, Dostoevskii's only sustained meditation on Holbein's "Dead Christ" is refracted through the voice ofIppolit in the same novel: The picture represented Christjust taken down from the cross ... In the painting his face is dread- fully disfigured by blows, swollen, covered with terrible swollen and bloody bruises, the eyes open, the pupils turned up, the large open whites of the eyes bright with a sort of deathly, glassy reflection... As one looks at that painting, one conceives of nature in the form of some huge, implacable, dumb beast, or to be more exact, to be much more exact, though it may seem strange, in the form of some huge machine of the latest design which, deaf and unfeeling, has senselessly seized, crushed, and swallowed up a great and priceless being, a being worth all of nature and its laws, all the earth, which was perhaps created solely for the advent of that being!

(8:338, 339) Ippolit's ekphrasis on Holbein's "Dead Christ" can be read as an Enlightenment allegory of the death of God.3 The movement from the image of nature as a "huge, implacable, dumb beast" to the "much more exact" image of nature as a machine, one which has "senselessly seized, smashed and swallowed up" Christ, accords fully with the direction of Enlightenment demythologization, for the beast in the first image betrays an anthropomorphism that is greatly diminished in the second. The God-become-human dies in the grips of a nature whose laws the Enlightenment has deanimated. Yet as the verbs "seize," "smash," and "swal- low" also suggest, personified forces still lurk within the machine of nature. Ippolit's imagery plays on this ambiguity within the Enlightenment's attempt to free itself from the excesses of mythic barbarism, for the machine of nature is more pitiless towards everything living within it than any animalistic deity could ever be. The implications of Ippolit's description of Holbein's "Dead Christ" are nevertheless far more sobering than those arising from a conflation of Enlight- enment and myth would have been, for even if nature itself was perhaps created solely for the appearance of such a "great and priceless being" as Christ, the myth of his resurrection must vanish under the Enlightenment's ever more pen- etrating gaze into the laws of nature. Just as the machine of nature has obliter- ated both human life and the trace of the divine from Christ's face, so the myth of divinity itself has been left in ruins in the movement of human progress. For nature is a machine "of the newest design." Ippolit's contemplation of Holbein's "Dead Christ" is a melancholy gaze backwards in human history at a face once full of beauty but now no more than "nature alone" ("odna priroda") (428/8: 339). Ippolit even imagines Christ himself pausing to contemplate Holbein's paint- ing. After the cascade of paradoxes in the passage above, Ippolit asks: "If this very same teacher himself could have seen his image on the eve of his execution, would he have ascended onto the cross and died as he did?" ("I esli b etot samyi 3 At first glance, there is much in Ippolit's ekphrasis that appears anachronistic. Not only does he go on to imagine Christ standing before a Renaissance painting, but this painting in turn seems to have been transferred to the Enlightenment, where nature, following Descartes' lead, has become a machine. Yet Ippolit interprets world and even cosmic history here as much as he does Holbein's "Dead Christ." Indeed, the historical fortunes of Holbein's painting have not only framed Ippolit's thoroughly modern response, but might even be viewed as raw material for an almost Dostoevskian riff on the consequences of Catholicism's break with the Eastern Church. In his 1985 monograph on Holbein,John Rowlands argues, in opposition to the long-standing theory that Holbein's "Dead Christ" was to have served as the predella of an alterpiece, that "it was painted to be displayed in isolation" (53). In any case, Holbein's "Dead Christ" by-passed its intended liturgical setting and instead entered the art collection of his patron Bonifacius Amerbach, where many of Holbein's religious paintings remained protected from Protestant iconoclasm (32); a century later, in 1662, the Amerbach collection became the foundation for Europe's first public art gallery, the Kunstmuseum in Basel. If two centuries later Dostoevskii confronted Holbein's "Dead Christ" along the well-lit walls of a secular gallery, then in The Idiot this painting travels further, beyond schism and secularism, along the flow of modern capital: Rogozhin's father buys a reproduction of this painting at a Petersburg auction "for one or two rubles" ("za rubl' da za dva") (238/8:181).</page><page sequence="4">HOLBEIN &amp; DOSTOEVSKII/217 uchitel' mog uvidat' svoi obraz nakanune kazni, to tak li by sam on vzoshel na krest i tak li by umer, kak teper'?") (428/8:339). In placing Christ before a por- trait of his own corpse, Ippolit confronts the problem of representing the divine in modernity. The Word-become-flesh dies, in Holbein's painting, under the gaze of the modern subject. With the gradual development of linear perspective in Renaissance art, the suprasensual no longer seems to infuse reality with its infi- nite being; instead, it offers itself to the representations of the modern subject upon whom all being becomes grounded. As Erwin Panofsky puts it in his cel- ebrated essay on perspective, "perspective, in transforming the ousia (reality) into the phainomenon (appearance), seems to reduce the divine to a mere subject matter for human consciousness..." (72). In Holbein's "Dead Christ," Christ's body, in all its exhaustive anatomical detail, lies lengthwise in the foreground of a painting whose perspective is strictly delineated and delimited by the walls of a long, narrow, wooden tomb. If one were to extend Ippolit's ekphrasis, it is as if the dead body of Holbein's Christ has been interned in a space within which perspective has hollowed out the divine. Ippolit's Christ, gazing in turn at Holbein's "Dead Christ," witnesses his own death, violates his own tomb. Furthermore, if for Ippolit in Holbein's "Dead Christ" the laws of nature assume the guise of a machine, then Holbein's paintings, particularly his portraiture, tend to exemplify the mechanical precision with which natural objects can be represented through linear perspective.4 From Alberti's camera obscura to modern photography, linear perspective in painting has had a complex, often uneasy, relationship with mechanical analogues. Ippolit's ekphrasis on Holbein's "Dead Christ" thus continues a criticism of perspective-as-machine whose origins extend to the Renaissance. According to Panofsky, by the mid-sixteenth century a man- nerist "rebellion" against the "mathematical rules" of perspective had begun. Federico Zuccari (1540-1609), for example, protests that "the [artist's] intellect [must not be] restrained in mechanical servitude (in servitzu meccanica) to such rules" (73-78). Likewise, for many modernist critics, linear perspective does not simply provide rules for portraying nature; rather, it transforms nature into its own mechanistic mirror image. Just as for a twentieth-century Orthodox thinker such as Pavel Florenskii (who, like his contemporary Panofsky, considers perspective to be essentially symbolic), the type of culture within which perspective functions is "predatory and mechanistic" ("khishchnicheskii- mekhanicheskii") (138, 162), so for Ippolit, nature becomes a swallowing ma- chine in Holbein's "Dead Christ." Far from denying the realism of Holbein's "Dead Christ" on metaphysical grounds, however, Ippolit's images and paradoxes emerge precisely from this painting's success as an accurate rendering: [Rogozhin's painting] was in plain view the corpse of a man who has borne infinite agony even before the crucifixion, who has been wounded, tortured, beaten by guards, beaten by the people when he carried the cross and fell beneath its weight, and who, finally, has suffered the agony of crucifixion, lasting for six hours (by my calculation at least) ... the face of the dead man has not been spared in the least; it is no more than nature alone, and the corpse of any man, whoever he 4 Holbein's mastery of perspective is perhaps no more famously demonstrated, if somewhat para- doxically, than in the anamorphic skull that interrupts the continuity of space in "The Ambassa- dors" (1533).</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/218 may be, must really look like that after such suffering. I know that the Christian Church laid down, even in its early centuries, that Christ did not suffer figuratively but in fact, and that therefore his body on the cross was fully subject to the laws of nature ... But, strange to say, when one looks at this corpse, a certain curious question arises: if such a corpse (and it certainly must have looked like this) was seen... by all who believed in him and adored him, how could they believe ... that this martyr would be resurrected? (427, 428) [Kartina Rogozhina] v polnom vide trup cheloveka, vynesshego beskonechnye muki eshche do kresta, rany, istiazaniia, bit'e ot strazhi, bit'e ot naroda, kogda on nes na sebe krest i upal nod krestom, i, nakonets, krestnuiu muku v prodolzhenie shesti chasov (tak, po krainei mere, po moemu raschetu) ... litso ne poshchazheno niskol'ko; tut odna priroda, i voistinu takov i dolzhen byt' trup cheloveka, kto by on ni byl, posle takikh muk.

No stranno, kogda smotrish' na etot trup izmuchennogo cheloveka, to rozhdaetsia odin osobennyi i liubopytnyi vopros: esli takoi tochno trup (a on nepremenno dolzhen byl byt' tochno takoi) videli ... vse verovavshie v nego i obozhavshie ego, to kakim obrazom mogli oni poverit' . . . chto etot muchenik voskresnet? (8:338, 339) Even while remaining faithful to the subject matter of Christian iconography, the Renaissance image frees itself for the portrayal of nature at the gradual ex- pense of the Word. As Leonardo da Vinci writes in his Treatise on Painting, "the works of the painter represent the works of nature" (45). Yet this had not been the case with the medieval icon. The icon-maker's models derive not from na- ture itself, but from prior icons, and these prior icons are themselves copies of copies whose original-in the Byzantine tradition-was an icon "not made by human hand" (acheiropotoietai). This meticulous preservation of historical proto- types from copy to copy articulates a distinctly iconographical realism (Uspenskii 167-70). The Renaissance image, by contrast, represents a space that is ontologically severed from the surface of the picture plane. Human models mas- querade as divine beings before the canvas of the Renaissance artist. Accordingly, Holbein does not simply replicate a canonical icon of Christ; he represents a human corpse. Indeed, if God created man in his image, then there are few details by which to distinguish Holbein's Christ-the wounds on his feet, his side, and his right hand, and the loincloth covering his naked body-from the "corpse of any man." In his monograph on Holbein,John Rowlands recounts a legend according to which Holbein chose as his model for the "Dead Christ" the corpse of aJew washed up from the Rhine (52), and Hans Reinhardt empha- sizes that the painting is described in the seventeenth-century Amerbach cata- logue simply as the "Portrait of a dead man with the title Jesus Christus Rex Judaeorum" (22). Holbein thus unsettles any unproblematic identity between a canonical Christ-whose Word provides both the sanction for and the subject matter of Christian iconography-and the corpse in his "Dead Christ." Indeed, Ippolit imagines two Christs, one iconographic, the other realistic-the former, forsaken by God on the eve of his crucifixion, gazing at the latter, his double, who lies alone in a tomb. As Ippolit further observes, "not one [of the people surrounding the dead man] are in the picture" ("liudi, okruzhavshie umershego, kotorykh tut net ni odnogo na kartine"). Ippolit replaces the mourners who are absent from Holbein's "Dead Christ" with spectators, in "anguish and confusion" ("tosku i smiatenie") (428/8:339), who gaze at this painting from without. By depicting only one instant in the decay of a solitary corpse, Holbein brings the</page><page sequence="6">HOLBEIN &amp; DOSTOEVSKII/219 narrative of the resurrection to a standstill.5 However, while Holbein's "Dead Christ" may thus elude the doctrinal function of religious art, in no way does this painting trivialize Christ's Passion. Rowlands argues against such "nineteenth-century commentators" as Dostoevskii that the "message" of Holbein's painting was "intended as one of belief": Such paintings, produced as aids to devotion, were meant to be as dramatic as possible, so that the viewer's powers of imagination would be greatly intensified in contemplating the Passion and Christ's "bloody sweat." It was this heightened sense of drama for reliving the events, that was taken up later by St Ignatius and used to such effect by his followers. (52, 53) Yet whatever Dostoevskii's anachronisms might be, Ippolit does linger on Christ's "infinite agony," the traces of which remain visible in the wounds on his dead body, and the narrative impulse of Ippolit's ekphrasis returns again and again to the events surrounding the crucifixion: the teacher's followers "flee" ("razoitis"') (428/8:339) from Holbein's "Dead Christ" just as they fled from the cross; and the teacher himself, who felt the burden of his cup at Gesthemane, gazes in advance at an image of his own sacrificed flesh. Through the dramatization of what would have to be overcome to raise this body from the dead, a miracle that remains unrealized within the frame of Holbein's "Dead Christ," yearning for belief becomes intensified against the foil of despondency and doubt. For Ippolit's Christ, for Myshkin, and for Dostoevskii, who stand on the same side of the thresh- old of belief as do Rowlands's "viewers," Holbein's painting draws the miracle of the resurrection into an unbearable, and yet all too human, encounter with the physicality of Christ's broken body.6 Ippolit's ekphrasis should thus not be interpreted as a sanction for atheism; nor is Holbein's "Dead Christ" the "distorted Christ" ("iskazhenn [yi] Khrist[os] ") (560/8:450) of Catholicism whom Myshkin describes later in The Idiot.7 On the contrary, it is the absence of a clear message on the question of belief and dis- belief that so disturbs Ippolit, Myshkin, and Dostoevskii. For in Holbein's paint- ing the machine of nature does not offer a new meaning in the place of that great being it has "senselessly"("bessmyslenno")-also "meaninglessly"-seized, crushed, and swallowed up. As Ippolit argues, I believe that painters usually have a way of depicting Christ, either on the cross or being taken down from the cross, with a trace of extraordinary beauty still in his face; they strive to preserve this beauty in him even during his most dreadful agonies. In Rogozhin's painting there was no trace of beauty. (427; literally, "no word of beauty") 5 In a recent article, Christina Farronato analyzes the "horror of the broken narrative" in Holbein's "Dead Christ": "Most of all, Holbein violates Alberti's principles of the istoria, placing the body in complete solitude. The elimination of the characters around the body of Christ has the effect of breaking the Christic narrative: Christ is no longer a ransom for the salvation of humanity, but simply a dead human being that has been relinquished" (131). 6 Concerning Renaissance models of religious contemplation, it could be argued that Ippolit's ekphrasis tempers the pathos of St. Ignatius with the antinomian spirit of Erasmus' Praise of Folly (for which Holbein provided woodcuts). Moreover, the Underground Man's distinction between the "man of consciousness" ("chelovek usilenno soznaiushchii") and his "antithesis" ("antitez"), "direct people and men of action" ("neposredstvennye liudi i deiateli") (5:103, 104), can be read as a parodic trans- position (via Rousseau) of the Neo-Platonist distinction between vita contemplativa and vita activa. There is no assurance in Dostoevskii's novels that contemplation leads anywhere beyond the underground. 7 Neither Dostoevskii nor his characters discuss Holbein's beliefs directly. For an examination of the limited evidence concerning Holbein's religious views, see F. Saxl's "Holbein and the Reformation."</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/220 Mne kazhetsia, zhivopistsy obyknovenno povadilis' izobrazhat' Khrista, i na kreste, i sniatogoso kresta, vse eshche s ottenkom neobyknovennoi krasoty v litse; etu krasotu oni ishchut sokhranit' emu dazhe pri samykh strashnykh mukakh. V kartine zhe Rogozhina o krasote i slova net ... (8:338) Is Ippolit's anxiety concerning the collapse of meaning in Holbein's "Dead Christ" that far removed from the tendency of so many of Holbein's Protestant contemporaries to devalue the religious image as image? On January the 27th, 1522, at almost the same time as Holbein was working on the "Dead Christ" in his adopted city, Basel, Andreas Rudolff-Bodenstein von Karlstadt published the Reformation's first major thesis calling for the destruction of images: ... what good might lay persons learn from ... images? ... From an image of the crucified Christ you learn no more than the physical suffering of Christ-how he drooped his head and such like. But Christ says that his flesh is of no avail but that the spirit is of much value and gives life ... Since images are mute and deaf-incapable of seeing, hearing, learning, or teaching-and point to noth- ing than to mere flesh which is of no benefit, it follows inevitably that they are useless. But the word of God is spiritual. It alone is useful for believers. (107)8 For Karlstadt, as for so many Protestant Reformers, there is no truth in painting. In contrast to the celebration of human beauty in Italian Renaissance religious art, Holbein represents, with "no word about beauty," the naked body of a Christ made humble by death. In contrast to Erasmus' speculation that in the good man's "higher faculties" of memory, intellect, and will "is reflected the image of the supreme mind which alone they call the summum bonum" (203, 204), Holbein locates the intersection between the image of Christ and a human model, if any intersection is to be seen at all, in their common flesh. In contrast to Karlstadt's thesis that "from the image of the crucified Christ you learn no more than the physical suffering of Christ," Holbein offers an image of Christ-in whose face "suffering still seems to continue" ("progliadyvaet stradanie, kak budto by eshche i teper' im oshchushchaemoe") (427/8:339) and yet who also, alone in a tomb, seems to find refuge at last from suffering-that is more profound in its silence than any doctrine. Holbein, whether in his secular or his religious art, portrays suffering and death without burdening his melancholy paintings with meaning beyond suffering or death.9 The "Dead Christ" lies fully within this circle of sor- row. Painting in the narrow space between the biblical source for his "Dead Christ" and the Church-sanctioned doctrines that images on this subject are supposed to impart to the viewer, Holbein presents a realistic image of the dead Word. Ippolit's Holbein is a realist notjust on philosophical grounds, but at the level of representation. For the nineteenth-century realist author or painter, the nega- tive limit of representation is reached when mimesis entirely cancels out diegesis; or, to use the critical terms of Dostoevskii's contemporaries, when reality is "reproduced" without 'judgment"10 Dostoevskii conceived of this negative limit 8 In his book Art and the Reformation in Germany, Carl C. Christensen discusses Kardstadt's theses and this passage in particular (33). 9 In Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia, Julia Kristeva has explored the melancholy nature of Holbein's art: "Between classicism and mannerism [Holbein's] minimalism is the metaphor of sev- erance: between life and death, meaning and nonmeaning, it is an intimate, slender response of our melancholia" (137). 10 Chernyshevskii, for instance, broaches this limit in his 1855 treatise "Esteticheskie otnosheniia iskustva k deistvitel'nosti" ("The Aesthetic Relationship of Art to Reality"). Yet even he recoils from</page><page sequence="8">HOLBEIN &amp; DOSTOEVSKII/221 in mechanical terms. He frequently derided genre painting as mere daguerreo- type, and he similarly condemned the "photographic machine" ("photografichesk- [aia] mashin [a] ") imitated by such contemporary writers as Uspenskii: You can't say to a person: satisfy yourself with the analysis and accumulation of material and don't think or reach any conclusions. It's the same as saying: don't look with your eyes, don't smell with your nose. In such a prescription there will be violence, and any violence is unnatural, abnormal, criminal. Nel'zia skazat' cheloveku: udovol'stvuisia analizom i nakopleniem mater'iala i ne smei myslit' i vyvodit' zakliucheniia. Eto vsie ravno esli skazat': ne gliadi glazami, ne niukhai nosom. V takom predpisanii budet nasilie, avsiakoe nasilie neestestvenno, nenormal'no, prestupno. (19:179) Yet the violence of realism has an even more complex place in Dostoevskii's novels than as an example of mechanical representation. It is not through a har- mony of sounds, the gentle murmur of a poetic meter, that Dostoevskii responds to the silence of being; nor is it through a spare, impartial, and detached prose that Dostoevskii records the words and deeds of his characters. On the contrary, the raw and prolix language of his novels is unabashedly unpoetic and polemi- cal. On their path to nature, the words of Dostoevskii's characters, and of his shape-shifting narrators, inevitably confront the words of others. No sooner does a character express the most holy, the most lyrical, or the most cynical idea-in short, the idea that most embodies that character's world view-than this idea gives rise, not merely to its antithesis or to an authorial critique, but to a waste- land of parodic doubling. The Brothers Karamazov is a tragedy of speaking. Ivan's enlightened credo "everything is permitted" ("vse pozvoleno") quickly becomes parodied as it is endlessly repeated by his multiplying doubles: the petty atheists Miusov and Rakitin, who vulgarize Ivan's idea even as they hypocritically denounce it; the Devil, who mocks and torments Ivan precisely by incarnating all the banal- ity that lurks within it; Smerdiakov, in whose hands it becomes a weapon; and even Dmitrii, whose simplified "version" ("redaktsiia") is at least, in Ivan's words, "not bad" ("nedurna") (309/14:240). The word spoken becomes not a lie, as in Tiutchev's "Silentium," but corrupt-and no less so than the corpse of the Elder Zosima. Even silence can be parodied, as Dmitrii's misquote of this same poem of Tiutchev's, just before one of his many irrepressible confessions, so character- istically illustrates: "Be silent, heart/Be patient, be reconciled, and be silent!" ("Molchi, serdtse,/Terpi, smiriaisia i molchi!") (553/14:425). If words spoken undergo corruption, then through this process of corruption their bodies become staged, on the flipside of logomachia, as images. Whatever Dostoevskii's characters say, whatever ideas they defend, attack, or unconsciously flee, whatever visions of paradise or utopia possess them, however abnormally they behave under the influence of their ideas, and whatever unspeakable hor- rors are brought to pass when these ideas contaminate others, Dostoevskii repre- sents his ideational world through objective, realistic images. Under the author's objective gaze, even the voice of the narrator becomes an image. The narrator's a reduction of art to pure mimesis: "The essential meaning of art is the reproduction (vosproizvedenie) of that which is of interest to man in reality (v deistvitel'nosti). But while being interested in the manifestations of life, a person cannot, whether consciously or unconsciously, help but pronounce hisjudgment (prigovor) about them" (127).</page><page sequence="9">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/222 voice loses its self-complacency in relation to the voices of its characters when it in turn must submit to the regime of representation, and if Dostoevskii's realism transcends that of his contemporaries, then this is because in his novels mimesis of consciousness displaces authorial consciousness of reality. Central to the de- mythologized language of Dostoevskii's novels is the priority of seeing over speak- ing, a nihilism of the eye that prevents conceptual idols from limiting what can be said about the images that arise from the artist's field of vision. In its original definition in Turgenev's novel Fathers and Children, the term "nihilism" meant just such a radical empiricism. Yet whereas the modern gaze objectifies that upon which it falls, at the limit of Dostoevskii's objectivism characters emerge from behind the shadow of his authorial word as the images of self-conscious, self-defining subjects. Self-consciousness, as Bakhtin has argued, is the dominant of characterization in Dostoevskii's novels (49-54). Through the mimesis of consciousnesses, Dostoevskii attempts to resurrect God for modernity. The suprasensory world is visible in the lining of the consciousness of his characters, and thus God be- comes a possible object of representation precisely when the nihilistic eye peers into the mind of the human subject. As Ivan Karamazov suggests to Alesha, "what is so strange, and what would be so marvelous, is not that God actually exists, but that such an idea-the idea of the necessity of God-should have entered the head of such a savage and vicious animal as man ..." ("ne to stranno, ne to bylo by divno, chto bog v samom dele sushchestvuet, no to divno, chto takaia mysl'- mysl' o neobkhodimosti boga-mogla zalezt' v golovu takomu dikomu i zlomu zhivotnomu, kak chelovek . . .") (274/14:214). Such a nihilism of the eye neverthe- less extracts a heavy iconographical cost, for Dostoevskii overcomes the Enlighten- ment's anathema to the myth of the divine only by reinforcing Enlightenment epistemology. If Dostoevskii's realism constrains the scope of the objects that can be represented in his novels to the realm of the empirically verifiable (and thus tacitly rejects the Grand Inquisitor's defense of the staging of miracles), then, more profoundly, the mimesis of consciousness entombs the newly reborn God within the mind of the human subject. If Christ is permitted to appear in "The Grand Inquisitor," then it is his author Ivan who must answer for him. With the emergence in modernity of the human being as the only true subject, the Great Chain of Being becomes inverted. The Logos that once revealed itself to a fallen humanity through the signs lying within a created nature becomes replaced by the projected logic by which the human subject orders nature. Al- though Dostoevskii's realism negates the positivism of this logic by extending the gaze of nihilism to consciousness, the God who created the human subject now becomes infused with being only through the representations of that subject. From this ontological inversion arises the melancholy of the modern religious poet. The prohibition against graven images of God in the twentieth chapter of "Exodus" becomes an indictment of representation that targets the very foun- dations of modernity: thou shalt not make of God an object. The suprasensual God thus becomes unrepresentable precisely when the world becomes known through representation.</page><page sequence="10">HOLBEIN &amp; DOSTOEVSKII/223 2. Representing the Divine in The Brothers Karamazov With his "Dead Christ," Holbein paints at the representational limits of Dostoevskii's realism. It is in The Brothers Karamazov, not The Idiot, that Dostoevskii tries his own hand at making an icon of Christ. Yet Ippolit's ekphrasis on the "Dead Christ" lays down the sober iconology that governs the later image of Christ in "The Grand Inquisitor." By conjoining iconography and the dialectic of belief in the image of Christ before a painting of his own corpse, Ippolit exposes the high epistemological stakes of realism. In The Brothers Karamazov Dostoevskii seeks to 'justify the ways of God to Man" not through theology from the throne, as does Milton, but in the very attempt to draw an image of Christ in a realist novel. This project is a gamble in Messianism, for if the beauty of the Word-become- image might "save the world," then the scandal of a God-become-object under the gaze of the modern subject-upon whom all being is now grounded-would only quicken God's death. In the "literary introduction" ("literatur[noe] predislovi[e] ") to his "little epic" ("poemka") "The Grand Inquisitor," Ivan Karamazov grapples with this incom- mensurability between traditional iconography and modern realism: You see [Alesha], the action of my poem takes place in the sixteenth century and in those days, as you no doubt know from your lessons at school, it was the custom in poetical words to bring heav- enly powers down to earth. I'm not even talking about Dante. In France court clerks as well as monks in monasteries performed plays in which the Madonna, the angels, the saints, Christ, and even God himself were brought on the stage. In those days it was all done very artlessly. (289) Vidish' [Alesha], deistvie u menia proiskhodit v shestnadtsatom stoletii, a togda,-tebe, vprochem, eto dolzhno byt' izvestno eshche iz klassov,-togda kak raz bylo v obychae svodit' v poeticheskikh proizvedeniiakh na zemliu gornye sily. Ia uzh pro Danta ne govoriu. Vo Frantsii sudeiskie klerki, a tozhe i po monastyriam monakhi davali tselye predstavleniia, v kotorykh vyvodili na stsenu Madonnu, angelov, sviatykh, Khrista i samogo boga. Togda vse eto bylo ochen' prostodushno. (14:224, 225) Demarcating approximately the same historical divide here as Heidegger (and later Foucault) does for representation,1 Ivan excludes such Renaissance reli- gious drama from modernity. After providing a few examples of pre-modern European and Russian texts in which divine beings are cast as characters, Ivan states that "my poem would have been of that sort, had it appeared in that time" ("moia poemka byla by v tom zhe rode, esli b iavilas' v to vremia") (289/14:225). The possibility of representing the divine necessitates this regression from the realism of the poem's novelistic frame to an anachronistic genre of religious art. Yet at the same time this poem, which Ivan "has not written" ("ne napisal") (288/ 14:224), remains very much engaged with the concerns of its frame. Ivan and his listener Alesha sit alone at a table behind a screen in a bar, but Ivan cannot cloak his poem in the occult, for no sooner does he begin to recite this poem than Alesha puts forward the demands of realism. Christ appears unannounced in Seville at the height of the Inquisition, not in "all his glory" ("v vsei slave nebesnoi") as he promised he would at the end of time, but in the "image... of a man" ("v... obraze chelovecheskom") (291/14:226). The people of Seville are irre- 1 In "The Age of the World Picture," Heidegger isolates the first emergence of "representation," the "essence of modern science": "what is to be is for the first time defined as the objectiveness of representing, and truth is first defined as the certainty of representing, in the metaphysics of Descartes" (551). See also Foucault's The Order of Things (46-58).</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/224 sistibly drawn towards Christ, who, repeating his own canonized models with the restraint of an icon-maker, soon heals a blind man and then raises a seven-year- old girl from the dead. It is at this moment that the Grand Inquisitor enters the scene. Christ is arrested and imprisoned on the Inquisitor's word and without any protest from a crowd whose weak and rebellious spirit has long ago been broken by the Roman Catholic Church. The Grand Inquisitor visits his silent prisoner in a cell on the following day. Here Alesha interrupts Ivan for the first time: "Is it just a wild fantasy, or has the old man made some mistake, some impossible quid pro quo?" ("priamo li bezbrezhnaia fantaziia ili kakaia-nibud' oshibka starika, kakoe-nibud' nevozmozhnoe qui pro quo"). Ivan laughs and responds that his brother can "accept the latter ... if modern realism has so spoiled you" ("primi khot' poslednee ... esli uzh tebia tak razbaloval sovremennyi realizm") (293/14:228). After Ivan finishes his poem, Alesha similarly questions the verisimilitude of the Grand Inquisitor. Ivan, no longer laughing, heatedly defends his character by noting the evidence thatJesuit texts provide: "Who knows, perhaps this accursed old man ... still exists even now in the form of a whole multitude of such individual old men, and not by chance, either, but by agreement, as a secret society formed long ago to guard the mystery.. ." ("Kto znaet, mozhet byt', etot prokliatyi starik, stol' uporno i stol' po-svoemu liubiashchii chelovechestvo, sushchestvuet i teper' v vide tselogo sonma mnogikh takovykh edinykh starikov i ne sluchaino vovse, a sushchestvuet kak soglasie, kak tainyi soiuz, davno uzhe ustroennyi dlia khraneniia tainy...") (307/14:239). For a generation of Russian critics, the criterion used to deter- mine truth in realism was the existence of a type in reality that corresponds to the reproduction of this type in literature. Testing the truth of Ivan's poem, Alesha pushes it, impossibly, towards the realm of the real. Ivan's image of the Inquisitor contra Christ has been, to use a famous Benjamin phrase, "blasted out of the continuum of history" (262); or, to be more exact, two iconologies have collided in the contact between Ivan's antiquated poem and its modern frame. And yet Ivan's image of Christ conforms to far more subtle iconographical norms, both past and present, than those of a reductive realism. If Christ ap- pears in human form, then Ivan describes him in terms that are rigorously non- concrete and visually non-sensual: "He silently walks among [the people] with a quiet smile of infinite compassion. The sun of loves burns in his heart, rays of Light, Enlightenment and Power flow from his eyes..." ("On molcha prokhodit sredi [naroda] s tikhoiu ulybkoi beskonechnogo sostradaniia. Solntse liubvi gorit v ego serdtse, luchi Sveta, Prosveshcheniia i Sily tekut iz ochei ego . . .") (291/ 14:226, 227). Ivan's image of Christ, drawn through the nominalistic qualities and the light and fluid metaphors so characteristic of Orthodox hagiography, is thoroughly textual. What remains immediately visible is only Christ's movement, an aspect of the visual that, for critics of Lessing's persuasion, does not lend itself well to the medium of painting. Even Christ's "quiet smile" evokes visual sensa- tion only synaesthetically. The "Enlightenment" that flows from Christ's eyes does not offer itself up as an object before the eye of the Enlightenment, and thus the reader, in the absence of a direct gaze at the face of a God become man, can per- ceive this face's beauty only in the responses its image evokes in those to whom</page><page sequence="12">HOLBEIN &amp; DOSTOEVSKII/225 such a gaze has been permitted-that is, in the responses of the people of Seville. Christ's beauty, an affect of his infinite compassion, is secondhand. By contrast, Ivan portrays the ninety-year-old Inquisitor in far more painterly terms: he is "tall and erect" ("vysokii i priamoi"); he has a "withered face" ("s issokhshim litsom"), "sunken eyes" ("so vpalymi glazami"), and "gray thick eyebrows" ("sedye gustye brovi") (314/ 14:227). While Christ's kiss at the end of Ivan's poem is, like his smile, "quiet" ("tikho tseluet"), the Inquisitor's lips are pictured as "bloodless" ("beskrovnye") (308/14:239). If Ivan's image of Christ is entirely mediated by the word, then Ivan conforms in his iconography to the Grand Inquisitor's admonition to his silent prisoner that "you have no right to add anything to what you have said already in the days of old" ("ty i prava ne imeesh' nichego pribavliat' k tomu, chto uzhe skazano toboi prezhde") (293/14:228). In his only reported speech in "The Grand Inquisitor," Christ repeats his own canonical words "Talitha cumi!" when raising a girl from the dead (292; 14:228).12 In the prison cell, he receives the Grand Inquisitor's words in silence. Neither providing a direct and objectifying gaze at Christ nor placing words into his mouth, Ivan avoids the twin iconographical pitfalls of por- traiture and propaganda. Moreover, throughout the poem Ivan and Alesha refer to Christ only as "the prisoner" ("plennik"). Alesha calls this prisoner 'Jesus" ("lisus") (305/14:237) imme- diately after the poem's end; Ivan cites the final lines of Revelation, "Come Oh Lord" ("Bo gospodi iavisia nam") (290/14:226), in his introduction to the poem; and the Inquisitor paraphrases the tempter's words "if thou be the son of God, cast thyself down" ("syn li ty bozhii, to verzis' vniz") (299/14:232). Yet in the poem itself, the narrator Ivan and his Grand Inquisitor do not provide this prisoner with a name or title. Of all the poem's characters, only a blind man-following his own model from the eighteenth chapter of Luke-utters the title "Lord" ("Gospodi") (291/14:227). The people of Seville and the Grand Inquisitor al- lude to Christ's divinity only through the use of the intimate second-person pro- noun, "thou" ("ty"). Such restraint in naming God, even as it implies a common agreement about the identity of the prisoner, serves to emphasize the burden of depicting him.Just as Ivan seems to show an icon-maker's respect for the injunc- tion against graven images in the twentieth chapter of Exodus, so neither he nor his characters take the name of God in vain. Already a tale within a tale, the Grand Inquisitor's interrogation of Christ in a dimly lit prison cell provides the frame for yet a third, ever more ancient, legend: the three temptations of Christ in the wilderness: "The terrible and wise spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and non-existence... the great spirit talked with 12 In terms of this parallel reading of Ivan's "Grand Inquisitor" and Ippolit's ekphrasis on Holbein's "Dead Christ," it is perhaps not coincidental that the same story from the eighth chapter of Luke appears in both. As Ippolit writes, "How can [the laws of nature] be overcome when even he did not vanquish them, he who conquered nature in his lifetime, and whom nature obeyed, who cried 'Talitha cumi!' and the maiden arose, who cried 'Lazarus come forth!' and the dead man arose?" ("Kak odolet' [zakony prirody], kogda ne pobedil ikh teper' dazhe tot, kotoryi pobezhdal i prirodu pri zhizni svoei, kotoromu ona podchinialas', kotoryi voskliknul: 'Talifa kumi',-i devitsa vstala, 'Lazar', griadi von'-i vyshel umershii?") (The Idiot 427/8: 339). Similarly, Ivan states: "The coffin is lowered on to the steps at his feet. He gazes with compassion and his lips once again utter softly the words, 'Talitha cumi'-and the maiden arose" ("grobik opuskaiut na papert' k nogam ego. On gliadit s sostradaniem, i usta ego tikho i eshche raz proiznosiat: 'Talifa kumi'-'i vossta devitsa'") (The Brothers Karamazov 292/14:227).</page><page sequence="13">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/226 thee in the wilderness and we are told in the books that he apparently 'tempted' thee. Is this so?" ("Strashnyi i umnyi dukh, dukh samounichtozheniia i nebytiia ... velikii dukh govoril s toboi v pustyne, i nam peredano v knigakh, chto on budto by 'iskushal' tebia. Tak li eto?") (295/14:229). For the remainder of Ivan's poem, the Grand Inquisitor rewrites this story from the gospels of Matthew and Luke and provides an extended critique of Christ's responses to the tempter's questions. Christ should have, but did not, turn stones into bread in order to feed a weak, rebellious, vicious and ignorant humanity in exchange for its love and its freedom; Christ should have, but did not, cast himself down from the temple in order to eliminate the burden of faith through an incontestable miracle that would satisfy, once and for all, humanity's need for universal worship; Christ should have, but did not, accept the rule of all the kingdoms of the earth in order that humanity might at last become a unified world state, "a common, harmonious and incontestable ant-hill" ("besspornyi obshchii i soglasnyi muravei- nik") (302/14:235). Rejecting Christ, the Grand Inquisitor and the Roman Catholic Church have chosen to ally themselves with "him" ("s nim") (302/14:234; italics in the original), the tempter, and have set out to correct Christ's work by basing it on "miracle, mystery, and authority" ("chudo, taina, i avtoritet") (299/ 14:232). Even where no mystery exists and where no miracle occurs, the Roman Catholic Church, so as to establish and maintain its universal authority on earth, will stage the turning of stones into bread and will protect the masses from the knowledge that "beyond the grave they will meet only death" ("za grobom obriashchut lish' smert'") (304/14:236). Adorno has argued that "[t]he objective tendency of the Enlightenment" is "to wipe out the power of images over man" (Minima Moralia 140). While the Grand Inquisitor may be a creator of false idols, he is all the same a thoroughly enlightened iconoclast. Having awakened from the "madness" ("bezumi [e] ") (305/ 14:237) of Christ after years of wandering in the desert, the Inquisitor is mysti- fied neither by the image of the prisoner before him nor by the very staged miracles with which he would subjugate humanity: "For we alone, we who guard the mystery, we alone shall be unhappy. There will be thousands of millions of happy infants and one hundred thousands sufferers who have taken upon them- selves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil" ("Ibo lish' my, my, khraniashchie tainu, tol'ko my budem neschastny. Budet tysiachi millionov schast- livykh mladentsev i sto tysiach stradal'tsev, vziavshikh na sebia prokliatie poznaniia dobra i zla") (304/14:236). In a last bold iconoclastic gesture the Grand Inquisitor decrees: 'Tomorrow I shall burn you. Dixi." ("Zavtra sozhgu tebia. Dixi.") (305/14:237). At its most basic level, Ivan's poem is a contest (or "paragone," to borrow da Vinci's term) between the image of a silent Christ and the words of the Grand Inquisitor. While Christ, after having kissed the Grand Inquisitor, is permitted to leave his cell at the end of this contest, its outcome remains highly ambiguous. A textual gloss from Christ, which might have lent an authoritative meaning to the image of his own kiss, is lacking. Through the staging of this contest, Dostoevskii traces a labyrinthine web of relations between word and image in an attempt to construct a realist iconography for modernity. A silent Christ appears in Ivan's poem as an image, but this image is drawn with the brush of Ivan's metaphors;</page><page sequence="14">HOLBEIN &amp; DOSTOEVSKII/227 the Grand Inquisitor's words, as iconoclastic as any dialectic from Hegel to Adorno, themselves form the image of an idea in Ivan's poem, just as the charac- ter Ivan is an image in Dostoevskii's novel. If words forfeit their finalizing, propo- sitional power over images by becoming images themselves, then these images nevertheless experience the contradictory intentions of the words of others in the density of their own texture. This doubling of images through words and words through images protects against the positivism lurking within both words and images and at the same time prevents them from ossifying, in isolation from one another, into their negative limits-silence and iconoclasm. The image of a silent Christ, lit only by a candle in a dark prison cell, shines forth in the cross- fire of the Grand Inquisitor's words.13 Within this realist iconography there further lies an even more ancient, and at the same time more modern, interpenetration of word and image. Although the Grand Inquisitor provides an extended critique of Christ's responses to the tempter's three questions, his entire dialectic emerges from, and his iconoclasm subsides before, the image of these three questions themselves: And could anything more true have been said than what [that great spirit] revealed to thee in his three 'temptations'? And yet if ever there has been on earth a real, prodigious miracle, it was on that day... Indeed, it was in the appearance of those three questions that the miracle lay. If it were possible to imagine, for the sake of argument, that those three questions of the terrible spirit had been lost without leaving a trace in the books and that we had to rediscover, restore, and invent them afresh and that to do so we had to gather together all the wise men of the earth-rulers, high priests, scholars, philosophers, poets-and set them the task of devising and inventing three ques- tions which would not only correspond to the magnitude of the occasion, but, in addition, express in three words, in three short human sentences, the whole future history of the world and of man- kind, do you think that the entire wisdom of earth, gathered together, could have invented anything equal in depth and force to [these] three questions [?] ... For in those three questions the whole future history of humanity is, as it were, anticipated and combined in one whole, and three images are presented in which all the insoluble historical contradictions of human nature all over the world will meet.

(14:229, 230) In the Grand Inquisitor's iconological alchemy, three questions dissolve into three obraza (that is, "images" or "icons"), and yet the revelation bursting forth from within these images is contradiction. This alchemy returns iconography to its origins, for not only do these three images from the tale of the temptation of 13 Through this interpenetration of word and image, Dostoevskii would seem to have achieved more success-if success could said to be possible here-than his compatriot Aleksandr Ivanov in representing the divine. Having worked for twenty years on "The Appearance of Christ to People" ("Khozhdenie Khrista k narody") (1837-1857), Ivanov paints a mannerist Christ walking in the dis- tant background-easily the least dynamic of the painting's many figures. John the Baptist's gesture of recognition in the foreground is a pale beacon in contrast with the Inquistor's iconoclastic words.</page><page sequence="15">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/228 Christ in the wilderness render incarnate contradictions that must remain irresolvable throughout the course of human history until that moment when "there shall be time no longer," but within this tale within a tale within a tale the whole historical development of Christian iconography is traversed. Dostoevskii, a modern novelist, represents reality through objective images; Ivan, a pre-mod- ern icon-maker, copies models of the biblical Christ; and the Grand Inquisitor, an iconologue, perceives within the tempter's three questions "not made by hu- man hand" ("nerukotvornyi") three images in which the contradictions of hu- man history are made incarnate. If the Grand Inquisitor sides with the tempter's questions against the responses of Christ, it is nevertheless upon the Inquisitor's images of contradiction that Dostoevskii grounds his own theodisic aesthetic and upon which he sets his most important messianic stakes, stakes which Dmitrii's definition of beauty, in a different and yet highly relevant context, render explicit: Beauty is a fearful and terrifying thing! ... Here the shores meet, here all contradictions live side by side ... Yes, man is wide, too wide, indeed. I would narrow him. The devil knows what he really is! What appears shameful to the mind is sheer beauty to heart. Is there beauty in Sodom? Believe me [Alesha], for the great majority of people it is in Sodom and nowhere else-did you know that secret or not? The awful thing is that beauty is not only a terrible, but also a mysterious, thing. Here God and the Devil fight, and the field of battle is the human heart. (124) Krasota-eto strashnaia i uzhasnaia veshch'! . . . Tut berega skhodiatsia, tut vse protivorechiia vmeste zhivut... Net, shirok chelovek, slishkom dazhe shirok, ia by suzil. Yert zhaet chto takoe dazhe, vot chto! Chto umu predstavliaetsia pozorom, to serdtsu splosh' krasotoi. V sodome li krasota? Ver' [Alesha], chto v sodome-to ona i sidit dlia ogromnogo bol'shinstva liudei,-znal ty etu tainu il' net? Uzhasno to, chto krasota est ne tol'ko strashnaia, no i tainstvennaia veshch'. Tut d'iavol s bogom boretsia, a pole bitvy-serdtsa liudei. (14:100) Yet there is one crucial difference between the Grand Inquisitor's images of contradiction and Dostoevskii's theodisic aesthetic. If the realism of the frame places its demands on Ivan's anachronistic poem, then Ivan alludes to an iconology alternative to the one put forth by his own character, the Inquisitor. Moreover, the realist frame enveloping both of these iconologies in turn dissolves the grounds for their comparison. In the Grand Inquisitor's iconology, it is the Devil's Word, not God's, that becomes incarnate in an image. Ivan, on the contrary, is far more Orthodox in his iconology: In his infinite mercy he once more walked in the human image as he had walked among men for thirty-three years fifteen centuries ago ... He appeared quietly, inconspicuously, but everyone- and that is why it is so strange-recognized him. That might have been one of the finest passages in my poem-I mean, why they recognized him. (291) Po bezmernomu miloserdiiu svoemu on prokhodit eshche paz mezhdu liudei v tom samom obraze chelovecheskom, v kotorom khodil tri goda mezhdu liud'mi piatnadtsat' vekov nazad ... On poiavilsia tikho, nezametno, i vot vse-stranno eto-uznaiut ego. Eto moglo by byt' odnim iz luchshikh mest poemy, to est' pochemu imenno uznaiut ego. (14:226) Under the burden of a realist frame, Ivan's "might have been" passes over in silence the miracle of the incarnation, the miracle of the word become flesh- that is, the very miracle whose mystery might have revealed why the people of Seville are able to recognize Christ, and through which both Orthodox and Catho- lic iconography have historically justified themselves. In a biblical passage cen- tral to these justifications, Paul writes that Christ is the "image [eikon] of the invisible God" (Col. 1:15). If the "Word became flesh" (John 1:26) and if Adam</page><page sequence="16">HOLBEIN &amp; DOSTOEVSKII/229 was himself molded in God's image and likeness (Gen. 1:26, 27), then the icon reflects the invisible God within the human image of the incarnated Word. It is the miracle of the incarnation, even more than the miracle of the resur- rection, that is fundamental to Dostoevskii's theodisic aesthetic. In a letter to S.A. Ivanova, Dostoevskii writes: In the world, there is only one positively beautiful person-Christ, so that the appearance of this immeasurably, infinitely beautiful person is already an infinite miracle. (All ofJohn's Gospel in this sense; he finds the whole miracle in the incarnation, in the appearance of the beautiful.) Na svete est' odno tol'ko polozhitel'no prekrasnoe litso-Khristos, tak chto iavlenie etogo bezmerno, beskonechno prekrasnogo litsa uzh konechno est' beskonechnoe chudo. (Vse Evangelie Ioanna v etom smysle; on vse chudo nakhoditv odnom voploshchenii, v odnom poiavlenii prekrasnogo.) (28.2:251) Where Ivan remains silent, Holbein fills Ivan's silence with an image. With his head tilted back, mouth open and eyes rolled up, with the green and purple tint on his face and hands betraying the visible signs of corruption, and with his punctured right hand frozen as if still in spasm but more likely now in the first stages of rigor mortis, Holbein's "Dead Christ" betrays no trace of his divinity. To borrow the words of Paul, Holbein's Christ has emptied himself of spirit, "humbled himself (kenosis) and became obedient to death-even death on a cross" (Phil. 2:7, 8). This kenosis, or "emptying," is the all too human consequence of the miracle of the incarnation and its tragic reversal, in life no less than in death. As Ippolit writes, It is true that this is the face of a man who has just been taken down from the cross, that is, a face which still retains much warmth and life; nothing is rigid in it yet, and the suffering seems to con- tinue in the face of the dead man as if he were still feeling it (the artist has caught this very well) ... (427) Pravda, eto litso cheloveka, tol'ko chto sniatogo so kresta, to est' sokhranivshee v sebe ochen' mnogo zhivogo, teplogo; nichego eshche ne uspelo zakostenet', tak chto na litse umershego dazhe progliadyvaet stradanie, kak budto by eshche i teper' im oshchushchaemoe (eto ochen' khorosho skhvacheno artistom) ... (8:339) The Grand Inquisitor may not have carried through with the crucifixion he had desired, yet there are many characters in The Brothers Karamazov whose fates imitate the example of the kenotic Christ. For it is not only in Ivan's "Grand Inquisitor" that images of contradiction are drawn. Zosima's corpse gives off such a power- ful, unexpected, and precipitous odor of corruption that it is widely suggested, in a parody of the miracle of the incarnation, that this scandalous odor, by "vio- lating all the laws of nature" ("etot estestvo predupredil"), is a sign from God (389/14:300). And Ivan bases his rejection of God's creation upon "pictures" ("kartinki") (283/14:220) of suffering children: a baby shot by the very gun that is dangled before it as a toy; a serf boy hunted down and killed by the dogs of his master; and a girl, having been beaten by her parents and forced to eat her own excrement, locked all night alone in a latrine. Through such images Dostoevskii makes the most cruel of his gambles with his double Ivan: in the portrait of every suffering child lies the possibility of God. For images of contradiction do not provide resolution or synthesis. Casting light on the suffering wrought by the very irresolvable contradictions that they incarnate, images of contradiction provoke a response, force a choice. Indeed, the very fight between God and the Devil within the dark beauty of these images</page><page sequence="17">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/230 generates a long series of doubles on the two opposing sides of "pro and contra": the tempter versus the son of man, the Inquisitor versus his prisoner, Ivan versus Alesha. For if mechanical representation is the negative limit that Dostoevskii would strive to avoid at all costs with his ethically wrought images of contradic- tion, then these images function no less as theodisic machines. In a metapoetic parody, the Devil describes this "new method" to Ivan: I keep you dangling between belief and disbelief by turns, and I don't mind admitting that I have a reason for it. It's the new method, sir. For when you lose your faith in me completely, you will once again begin assuring me to my face that I'm not a dream, but do really exist ... (759) Ia tebia vozhu mezhdu veroi i bezveriem poperemenno, i tut u menia svoia tsel'. Novaia metoda-s: ved' kodga ty vo mne sovsem razuverish'sia, to totchas menia zhe v glasa nachnesh' uveriat', chto ia ne son, a esm' v samom dele ... (15:80) Ivan's "The Grand Inquisitor" has often been viewed as one of the key pieces of evidence in that most sensational murder of nineteenth-century Europe-the death of the Christian God. Giving weight to such interpretations, Dostoevskii, in a conversation with Strakhov, would himself declare that "never in Europe has there been atheistic expressions of such power" as in "The Grand Inquisitor" (qtd. in Simmons 365). D.H. Lawrence, in a similar vein, argues that "[Dostoevskii's final] opinion [aboutJesus] is, baldly, this: Jesus, you are inadequate. Men must correct you. AndJesus in the end gives the kiss of acquiescence to the Inquisitor" (91). And yet Dostoevskii's images also draw responses, both within and beyond the novel, from the other side of the threshold of belief. Alesha exclaims to Ivan, "Your poem is in praise ofJesus, not a criticism ... as you had wanted" ("Poema tvoia est' khvala Iisusu, a ne khula ... kak ty khotel togo") (305/14 237), and the twentieth-century Orthodox theologian Nikolai Berdiaev confesses that "the 'Legend of the Grand Inquisitor'. . . made such an impression on my young mind that when I turned to Jesus Christ for the first time I saw him under the appear- ance that he bears in the Legend" (7).14 For the Underground Man, "suffering is doubt, negation ... Suffering is the only principle of consciousness" ("stradanie est' somnenie, est' otritsanie ... Stradanie-da ved' eto edinstvennaia prichina soznaniia") (5:119). Yet the faith or rebellion, compassion or repulsion, that the images of contradiction in The Brothers Karamazov have evoked in so many readers and characters alike is as much the result of the affect emanating from the intensely visceral suffering in these images as it is of the burden of the questions that these images pose for con- sciousness. Christ, a man of sorrows in whose eyes flow infinite compassion, ap- pears "to the tormented and suffering" ("k muchaiushchemusia, stradaiushchemu") (290/14:226) people of Seville, heals their sick, raises their dead. And a five- year-old girl prays all night in a latrine to the very God-her bozhen'ka ("little God")-whose world Ivan rejects in the name of her tears. By subjecting images of suffering to the dialectic of belief and the dialectic of belief to the horror of 14 Further testimony to the double-edged rhetorical force of Dostoevskii's images can be found in how often critics and readers become persuaded that Dostoevskii, even if against himself, is on their side. Lawrence, for instance, who considers "The Grand Inquisitor" to be "drearily true to life" (90), places not only Dostoevskii, but also Christ and even Alesha on the side of Ivan the Grand Inquistor. As for Alesha himself, Ivan's "first reader, or rather listener" ("pervyi moi chitatel', to est' slushatel'") (288/8:224), he places his brother on the side of Christ.</page><page sequence="18">HOLBEIN &amp; DOSTOEVSKII/231 the image, Dostoevskii radically reduces the aesthetic distance between liter- ary portraiture and the subject's gaze and between philosophy and the disin- terested mind. It is the shock of this immediacy, even more than the logic of Ivan's dialectic, that calls out, with such urgency, for responses to the questions of God and of the justice of his created world while simultaneously making all answers inadequate. For although images of contradiction produce belief and disbelief by turn, there does not lie within them the consolation of truth. Indeed, within the mel- ancholy world of Dostoevskii's novels, are not images of suffering-"the tears of a child" ("slez[ki] rebenochka") in Ivan's famous example-worth more than "the whole of human knowledge" ("ves' mir poznaniia") (283/14:220, 221)? Dostoevskii, departing from Siberia, would write that "there is nothing more beau- tiful, more profound, more attractive, more reasonable and more manly than Christ" and that "if it should be proved to me that Christ is outside the truth, and if it really were so that truth is outside Christ, then I would rather stay with Christ than with the truth" ("net nichego prekrasnee, glubzhe, simpa[ti]chnee, razumnee, muzhestvennee i sovershennee Krista ... esli b kto mne dokazal, chto Khristos vne istiny, i deistvitel'no bylo by, chto istina vne Khrista, to mne luchshe khotelos' by ostavat'sia so Khristom, nezheli s istinoi") (28.1:176). Even before Holbein's image of the dead Christ, along the length of his body, lit softly from below. Or, again, more cryptically, as Dostoevskii writes in his private notebook, shortly before beginning work on The Brothers Karamazov: "only in realism is there no truth."15 Columbia University Works Cited Adorno, Theodor W.
