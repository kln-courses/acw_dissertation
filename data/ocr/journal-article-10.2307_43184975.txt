Even the most cursory survey of social science schol- arship confirms that a "material turn" has installed things at the heart of a broad range of disciplinary narratives. Once ignored and invisible, material things apparently have secured new consequence as a host of thinkers turn mute objects into rich symbolic vessels. Archaeo- logical analysis has ostensibly always been about mate- rial things; nevertheless, archaeological thought is much like the broader material culture theory, in which things are simply the methodological vehicles delivering us to the "real" focus. Somewhat ironically, things loom in material culture scholarship as representative symbols, rather than as concrete and even sensuous realities shap- ing human experience. Ian Hodder steps into this discussion as a champion of things, aspiring to see them as something more com- plicated than mere human reflections and instead paint- ing them as "entangled" in a web of interdependencies with people and places across space and time. Hodder hopes to redeem things by underscoring the agency of materiality and pressing to illuminate, if not articulate, the ways that material things shape human life. Entan- gled grants material objects enormous sway over human life, aspiring to compel archaeology to illuminate the consequence of materiality in ways that assertively rec- ognize how the literal materiality of things - shape , tem- perature, color, weight, size, substance, and so on- influences material symbolism. Hodder starts with the proposition that things and humans are in a dialectic relationship that he dubs entan- glement. Much of his articulation of entanglement will resonate with archaeologists: for example, the notion that things shape human experience and humans impact the material world is already a bedrock assumption of archaeologists ; Hodder 's anti-determinism is increas- ingly common in contemporary archaeological thought; and his claim that the specific material attributes of par- ticular things shape material meanings outside human control is not especially novel. Much of Hodder's narrative is committed to "breaking] out of a human-centered, social-centered approach" (p. 208), a move that aspires to temper the focus on goods' symbolic properties as defined by peo- ple and instead turns to science to analyze the material world. Many of the material descriptions are taken from Hodder's excavations at Çatalhõyiik, with various spe- cialists weighing in on clay balls, feasting, architecture, and burial ritual to paint a data-rich picture of entangle- ments. For instance, Entangled examines how prosaic architectural materiality had cascading effects: wooden house posts were replaced as trees disappeared from the area, replaced by thicker, sandier bricks whose deeper clay extraction pits in turn led to invasive plants and a lowering of the water table. Hodder models such strings of causality with concrete relationships between things and human actions, but there are no especially isolated root causations in such a perspective. For many archae- ologists, such an overdetermined model of causality will be more intuitively compelling than grand theory. Hodder's more radical gamble lies in the depth of power he invests in things and the sort of mysticism that pervades Entangled and animates things. In Hodder's analysis, that vitality comes from neither people nor things alone but, instead, from a sort of kinetic interde- pendence that exists as an apprehensible if not wholly articulable materiality; that is, the world of things and humans is embedded in ideas, practice, experience, and energies that are the inseparable flesh of existence and that exist in some ways outside expression or aware- ness. Entangled ambitiously seeks to express the emo- tional depth of material things: in Hodder's telling, unruly material things entrap humans; objects are fickle and involve debts and obligations; and humans and things are stuck to each other.

The book's framing concept, that things and humans are embedded in interacting relationships, is largely independent of any specific theoretical framework, so Entangled aspires to be a work of hybridized theories that revolve around how human and things are linked. Hodder 's notion of entanglement perhaps should not be characterized as a theory or a method as much as an onto- logical framework for defining archaeology's funda- mental focus and for interpreting human materiality. The book can be circumspectly labeled post-processual in its aversion to grand theory and potentially reifying concepts like culture; however, at the same time, it assertively revolves around conventional material analy- sis and tempers its potentially radical vision of things with measured science. Entangled is a book of theorizing that ironically advocates no theory. Hodder liberally appropriates from a wide range of theories, and his announcement that "supposedly opposed perspectives have complemen- tary parts to play" (p. 221) aspires to an archaeology that is rigorously scientific while it avoids lapsing into restrictive grand theory. Consequently, Entangled emerges as a provocative thinking exercise more than an especially concrete model for how to conduct "entan- gled" analysis. Entanglement will not radically under- mine most scholars' thinking as much as it aspires to complicate how we conceive archaeology itself. Entan- gled offers no contrived resolution to research questions as much as it aspires to an ambitious model of human life that is inseparable from the material world.</page></plain_text>
