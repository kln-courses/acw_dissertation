<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PLEASURES OF THE TEXT- DANCES WITH DACHSHUNDS Come decades into the present century, the story goes, a junior lecturer from the Harvard School of Business, visiting Oxford, Balliol perhaps, is introduced to one of the more venerable phi- losophers of the place, a man who in his declining years has been obliged to make use of an earhorn. "What is your interest in philosophy, young man?" "Business ethics, sir." "Eh? Can't hear you. Speak up." Into the earhorn, more deliberately: "Business ethics!" "Louder, young fellow. Can't make it out." "BUSINESS . . . ETHICSr The old don brings down his earhorn and shrugs. "It's no use. All I get is 'business.. ethics.' "* Would the gentleman have fared better with the goings on in the essays of our Summer Issue? Very possibly not. What would he have said to Stephen Webb? "All I get is 'dog theology.' " And to Daniel Deffenbaugh? "Sounds to me like 'think like a mountain.' " He would run up against Lothar Hönnighausen's explication of ecopoetics in Gary Snyder and Wendell Berry, and Babette Babich on the poetic construction of nature in the work of Fried- rich Hölderlin. If all this weren't enough, our man would find himself ponder- ing with Elizabeth Sewell a relation between Shakespeare (Airs Well That Ends Well) and Goethe (Elective Affinities) based not on character or plot but on the presence in these major works of something called alchemical love-knots. Could we blame him if he decided straightaway to turn in the earhorn for some more modern means of communication? How about something really newfangled, an Internet connection? Not if he had any inkling Soundings 78.2 (Summer 1995). ISSN 0038-1861.</page><page sequence="2">198 SOUNDINGS Ralph V. Norman that he might be asked to hear, from Marlena Corcoran, about the emergent electronic erotics of "Male and F:e/mail." William Pratt would be the last straw. His article on T. S. Eliot at Oxford, ostensibly the sanest and most accessible piece in the lot, purports to describe a wholly rational person, an Oxford man, deciding to commit a wholly irrational act, namely to forsake Phi- losophy for poetry and criticism. Now, actual Soundings readers, as opposed to our hypotheti- cally translated don, have always been a venturesome and also a patient breed, but lest even they begin to lose courage at the prospect of such a licentiousness of neologism, oxymoron, atten- uated metaphor, and all-around improbability as is here adver- tised, let me offer this reassurance. An editor has a conscience, too, like anybody else. Granted, editors of learned interdiscipli- nary journals have much less conscience than their peers at pub- lications where close adherence to the canons of a professional guild may be required - outfits like The Review of the North Ameri- can Neolithic Academy y or Pro Insipiente: Newsletter of the International Friends of Gaunilo. Let's face it, we take more chances. We are never unmindful, when we set before you essays like these, that the several earhorns of our readers may at any moment come down in disbelief or incomprehension. But in the matter at hand, I am not worried. There is an im- portant quarrel just below the surface of these papers. Many of them talk ecology, albeit in the dialect of some other field, but they do not, as a set, represent a single party or point of view. Nor do they necessarily correct each other, as if interdisciplinary truth were guaranteed to float lazily up out of the heat and smoke of every scholarly debate. It's just that our Summer subject is Nature, and Ourselves Within It or Outside It or Against It - considerable matters every one, raising questions of much general and justifiable fore- boding. Wherever such topics are broached today, the air is heavy with good intentions and high seriousness. So yes, vener- able sir, our authors are trying out some ideas here that are as curious and as hard on the hearing as "business ethics." I am afraid there is probably no less cumbersome way of lead- ing into these themes than to say that they concern the conjuga- tion of human being and the natural environment, a relation which appears to start out so innocently, with Us on one side and</page><page sequence="3">The Pleasures of the Text 199 It on the other, but keeps refusing to stabilize. Our authors show what happens when you figure less abstractly identified players into the equation, like the wolf, the poodle, the alchemist, the poet, and - ah wilderness! - the occasional star-crossed pair on the Internet We might begin with a respectful bow toward the actual disci- pline to which ecotheology, ecoethics, and ecopoetics allude and appeal, the science upon whose basic intellectual capital they claim to draw their lines of credit. On the face of it, the science of ecology seems an unlikely resource for ethicists and poets. In the stricter and less metaphoric sense ecology is a rigorous enter- prise, at once intensely descriptive and almost purely tautologi- cal, remarkable for the persistence with which its practitioners invoke and confirm two cardinal premises, those of internal relat- edness, or system, and totality, or completeness, respectively. All living things form systems to which they contribute and without which they cannot be sustained, and these systems are themselves sus- tained within more comprehensive relations, which cannot in principle be said ever to be exhausted in a terminus or limit. If the findings of ecology seem to proceed flawlessly out of its premises, this cannot be much of a surprise, since every natural occurrence is presumed to take place within some systematic whole, and the ideas of "system" and "whole" run up and down the tracks of an elaborate tautology. The empirical side of this venture is of course what qualifies it as a natural science and makes it something different from a sub- chapter of metaphysics. The ecologist asks, "Does this organism depend exclusively upon that set of conditions? What happens when the conditions shift or are interrupted? At what points do balance, equilibrium, and inner sustainability appear and disap- pear?" And so on. Not only does empirical investigation reveal what the poet Ge- rard Manley Hopkins called the inscape and instress of living sys- tems, what Scotus before him dubbed the haecceitas (thisness, singularity) of each, but it also provides the indispensable tags that will mark the crucial transitions and intersections among these systems. The descriptions delivered by ecology are, in a non-trivial sense, pages of illustrations. The generative logic of the disci- pline is always already there, waiting to be fleshed out. The</page><page sequence="4">200 SOUNDINGS Ralph V. Norman world, not simply the learned world but the organized world of public and practical affairs, looks increasingly to ecology for these findings, and increasingly depends upon them. It thinks it already knows the kind of information that will be delivered and how to use it, partly because the world of affairs sees itself as de- ploying in commerce, industry, and government a logic that is analogous to the logic of ecology. This is largely an illusion. By definition, ecological systems will be whole and complete. Human systems are patchwork at best and are never whole. In Hopkins's phrase, they "wear man's smudge and share man's smell." Just so, the immense structural gap between the formal and the empirical sides of ecology helps explain why, as a science, it tends to be subject forever and again to certain embarrassing un- scientific or at least nonscientific interjections, as when efforts are made to fix or valorize a system at one or more of the inter- sections its descriptions have tagged, and thereby make more of them than is warranted within the bounds of the science. The troubled debate about endangered species is an example. Ecologists can tell, empirically, when the system that sustains the spotted owl is endangered, but the science of ecology, as a grand discipline, provides no warrant for arresting, or trying to arrest, a larger system of events at that one system. The spotted owl must be befriended on other grounds, find some other pa- tron than "the system." The system is not a museologist - that is, it does little hoarding and no cataloguing. In terms of the con- trast Daniel Deffenbaugh draws between Gifford Pinchot and Ed- win Muir, the system is neither a conservationist nor a preservationist. Conservationist and preservationist moves reflect preferences brought from elsewhere. They are inescapably an- thropocentric. This is not to say there are not many styles and shades of such preference, some more successful than others in decking themselves out in the coloration and sanction of Natural Order. In American writers like Gary Snyder and Wendell Berry, the motives that form the inner logic of their ecopoetics, its moral, social, and political argument, are broad and eclectic. These in- clude nativism, primitivism, localism, and (in Snyder) a fair amount of orientalism. In his account of the practice of this po- etry, Lothar Hönnighausen displays a fine ear for what Stevens</page><page sequence="5">The Pleasures of the Text 201 called "the sound of words/' the range and nuance and subtlety of the verse in which this amalgam of doctrines has been given expression, but he keeps a quietly understated distance from the doctrines themselves. This critic has been at this scene before, knows not only his Emerson and Thoreau but also his John Ruskin and his William Morris. He is admiring, but one suspects he is not buying, not just yet. A Rhinelander by birth and by choice, he also happens to be a Faulkner scholar, and he has spent too much time in Yoknapatawpha County not to want to demand a hefty discount on any doctrine, whether poetic or political, that promises an uncomplicated, much less guilt-free possession of sacred groves, woodlands, and pastures. Several seasons among the Sutpens, Compsons, Snopeses, and Sartorises must have confirmed in him what he had no doubt gleaned already from the Roman and Ro- manesque inheritances of his homeland, that Nature's presence in our lives is mediated always by reasons Nature does not know, that we are not "in" Nature in exactly the way a part is "in" a whole, and that the notions in which we clothe our most cher- ished ambitions for this presence - belonging, being at home, owning, being entitled, being in control - are terms that have to be read out of some other textbook than that of Nature. The point is nicely made if we look at Snyder's poetic rendi- tion of his visit to Eureka, California, for a meeting of Governor Jerry Brown's Arts Council. Hönnighausen examines this story in strictest deadpan. First, we are told that Snyder takes exception to the town's "ecologically wrong use of wood," whatever that could possibly mean. His problem with Eureka has more to do, though, with the desolations wrought by absentee ownership. No- body seems to be in charge - nobody, that is, who cares about the place: No one who lives here has the power to run this town. Having lived most of my life not far from the coal-producing regions that lie along the border between southeastern Kentucky and East Tennessee, large tracts of which have been owned by distant British interests for well over a century, I understand what the poet means. But Snyder's localism and nativism must sooner or later fall into conflict with the lessons of ecology. He cannot</page><page sequence="6">202 SOUNDINGS Ralph V. Norman be much of an environmentalist if he is going to advocate local rule for towns like Eureka, California. We know too well, and he must know, how the citizens of these towns will vote when their choice is between jobs and the spotted owl, or indeed between jobs and global climate control. Like many eco-advocates, includ- ing Berry, he has trouble getting the Snopeses or even the Comp- sons to come into focus as moral agents, and sooner or later he will have to side with those who know better than the locals what is good for them. Or more precisely, what is good for the land, the system, the whole. He must turn eventually, as Deffenbaugh does, to a far wider court of appeal than Eureka, California, and with a far wider set of beneficiaries in mind for environmental ethics. Deffenbaugh, striking in this instance precisely the cold, clean, transcendental note I think a purist reading of ecology requires, writes: From an evolutionary perspective, the isolated organism is merely a token, a representative, which plays a small part in the propaga- tion of a living historical form: the species. This is the real unit of evolution and therefore the more significant reality which de- mands human respect. Our ethics must transcend a primary con- cern for individual interests or sentience with the ecologically informed realizatuion that in nearly every instance in nature the ultimate good of the group will inevitably involve the "transgres- sion" of particular "rights" (as when wolves cull the weak and the sick from the herds of caribou and thereby ensure the continued vitality of the species) . This is ecology neat, as the English might say, to be taken down without sentimentality and without tears. So much for your pet caribou, and so much for the good burghers of Eureka. We are talking species here, big-time, and big-time commitment to the whole earth, catalogued or uncatalogued. But does some real thing corresponding to the term "whole earth" ever exist, and if so how could its inhabitants possibly be polled, offered a plebiscite, given some say in the plan? Def- fenbaugh's answer is that, yes, there is indeed a whole earth just as surely as there is a science of ecology and that we'll sacrifice local interests to the good not so much of humankind as of the whole system of living species. By "we" he means, literally, just us humans, since both in the comprehensive planning business and in the voluntary self-sacrificing business, there is nobody here but us humans. Other animals will have their share of being sacri-</page><page sequence="7">The Pleasures of the Text 203 ficed (we'll see to that) but of course never voluntarily. The wolf will meanwhile continue to minister to the caribou, the lion to the lamb, and the rifleman to the deer. It is not clear whether Deffenbaugh, who tends to follow Whitehead in endorsing a continuity in sentience and value be- tween so-called lower and higher forms of life, is willing to make any principled concessions to the rights of humans as opposed to the rights of other animals. Apparently not; that is what gives an ominous cast to his decision to wrap "transgression" and "rights" inside quotes, as if they belonged to an older and outdated dis- pensation of language. Deffenbaugh does not blink or turn away from the extraordinary political, or more precisely, the anti-polit- ical implications. Does anybody else catch the first faint syllables of Newspeak? So the tension (an editor may not without discourtesy call it a contradiction) between a primitivist-idyllic valorisation of the lo- cal and a sublime valorisation of the whole earth is only one of a number of conundra that beset the well-intentioned borrower of ecological notions. The going gets murkier still in this matter of the human presence within ecological systems. Despite every- thing that is avowed about a continuity, the narrative of ecologi- cal weal and woe sooner or later veers in the direction of the space Odyssey. With the appearance of humans, so the narrative goes, the great system described by ecology has somehow been inter- rupted, perverted, broken apart, as if by aliens from outer space. The precise point at which the enemy began to show his cards and make trouble is variously identified, but some recent nomi- nees have been the decline of trout fishing, the advent of farm- ing, the emergence of the city, the birth of Plato, the invention of Jehovah, and the creation of the United States Department of Agriculture. Deffenbaugh does not declare himself on this one, although I suspect Agriculture. He offers a surprisingly gentle characterization of the faultbearer. Human culture, he says, is "an anomaly." And the greatest single mischief humans work is the artificial acceleration of natural processes: There is a fundamental difference between natural and anthropo- genic exterminations of species. Whereas the former occurs spon- taneously and does not significantly disrupt the generative processes of the biotic community, the latter may be compared to</page><page sequence="8">204 SOUNDINGS Ralph V. Norman a kind of premature death in which the essential flow of life is aborted. So it is the abruptness of humankind, its speed in effecting change, that is unnatural. To "follow nature" will be to avoid the "artificial" (that is, hasty) destruction or rearrangement of life forms. The spotted owl will probably have to go, but in the full- ness of biological time and at the behest of some slower-moving and presumably slower-witted predator which has no slightest in- tention of making a buck by shipping lumber off to Japan. Although humans do appear to be aliens of a sort, they can learn to nestle in, stop thrashing about like newcomers, do things the way the natives (the other creatures) do them. Thinking like a mountain would be a kind of ultimate step in this long-term centering-down. One imagines Superman walking among his orchards, making no sudden leaps or bounds anymore, gently picking aphids off the roses and blessing them as they scurry off to other employment. The aesthetic of gradualism and uniformitarianism that under- lies Deffenbaugh's otherwise quite rigorous appropriation of ecology is not shared by either Stephen Webb or Babette Babich. Observing with Heidegger and others that "nature" is a dialecti- cal and highly poetic construct, and yet intending no slightest diminution of the poeťs holy obligation to name and praise, she mounts a frontal attack upon what one might call the principle of nature's mere inclusiveness, its prosaic thereness or Zu- handenheit. Men and women and their gods and goddesses have muscled their way onto the scene wielding swords and words alike, remaking the earth and its laws, overturning the older di- vinities and their settled ways, risking the loss of holy and vital connection. These are by no means anomalous acts. Nor are they cumulative, exactly. What human art strives to achieve is the bal- anced moment, Nietzsche's suspended Augenblick, of praise and recognition. This much, and more, is the stuff of Hölderlin's un- relentingly agonistic poetry. Webb's vision of nature is likewise informed by a sense of its unruliness and extravagance, its sheer unmanageable excessive- ness. This is the quality that attracted Webb to Annie Dillard's rough-house theology in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek {Soundings [Fall/ Winter] 1994). Now, in "Pet Theories," with his loyal dachshund Marie on his lap, he turns to a meditation on the meaning of pets</page><page sequence="9">The Pleasures of the Text 205 in our experience of nature and grace, and he finds that pets (dogs, especially) body forth the unforeseen, unmerited, inex- plicable gift of creation. As I understand him, Webb offers a striking and highly origi- nal argument for the importance of pets, and in so doing he may have succeeded in offering his ecological friends a way of disen- tangling themselves from the briar patch. Quite briefly, the dog has come to occupy a unique place in the great chain of being by existing at a special sort of intersection, that of two sharply differ- ent lines or dimensions. Along the one line, the dog has an otherness that is and for- ever will be closed to us. In Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, T. S. Eliot suggests that every cat has its innermost ineffable name, known only to itself. Although Webb doesn't mention Eliot on cats, I think Eliot captured something like what Webb has in mind with the inviolable apartness of the dog. This quality is more conspicuous in cats, who for that reason are of less impor- tance than dogs in helping Webb make his case. The cat stands off and away, entering our world only on its own terms, but in the dog another line crosses the first and seems often to obscure it. This is the cheerful pliability of the dog, its availability for whatever pleases its mistress or master. In a quite literal sense, dogs are what we have made them. They have been bred and cross-bred and refined according to human taste and need over long centuries, and if the Westminster Kennel Club Show is not the goal of every dog-owner and the entelechè of every mutt who was ever groomed and trained by a human, this is prob- ably a matter of accident rather than of essence. And precisely in our relationship to this paradoxically distant and yet intimately available creature, says Webb, "there are clues to understanding how we can approach the world as both an inevitable extension of our own plans and projects and as something unpredictably and surprisingly valuable in itself. Nature is, for ill or good, becoming increasingly domesticated and decreasingly wild; far from idealizing a natural world that has no connection with human intentions, we must learn to deal with a world that is more and more dependent on us for its very survival. Webb goes on to agree with Harriet Ritvo that since we now maintain with all animals "a certain relationship of domination mixed with responsibility and generosity," they must all be under-</page><page sequence="10">206 SOUNDINGS Ralph V. Norman stood under the category of the pet. On this view Aldo Leopold's wolves as Deffenbaugh describes them are as surely our pets as any gussied-up poodle that ever prissed across the Armory floor. Don't underestimate the poodle. It is, remember, a certain feisty black poodle which in Goethe's poem comes sniffing and circling its way up to Faust to interrupt his Good Friday's labor of translating the Prologue to the Gospel of John into German: "Ev архл ó Aòyoç" has just become "Im Anfang war die Taf when this very pooch is transformed into a visiting scholar and introduces himself as Der Geist der stets verneint Fresh from his poodledom, Mephisto proceeds to give Faust a free lesson in eco-demonics: While man, this tiny world of fools, is droll Enough to think himself a whole, I am part of the part that once was everything, Part of the darkness that gave birth to light, That haughty light which envies mother night Her ancient rank and place and would be king. Yet it does not succeed: however it contend, It sticks to bodies in the end. It streams from bodies, it lends bodies beauty, A body won't let it progress; So it will not take long, I guess, And with the bodies it will perish, too.2 Goethe was perhaps the last European who could embed the vast learning of the natural sciences and the most advanced spec- ulations of the social philosophy of his time within the drama, the poem, and the novel without mere intellectual name-drop- ping. He did not require the subterfuges that later generations were to know and even prize as cottage. He was not only ac- quainted, for instance, with current economic theory but he could also think it through for himself well enough to make stun- ning imaginative connections with the esoteric discipline of al- chemy. The result, according to Hans Christoph Binswanger, is the much neglected and little understood but highly prophetic second part of Faust Binswanger, Director of the Institute for Economics and Ecology at St. Gallen, has shown in a provocative study {Money and Magic: A Critique of the Modern Economy in the Light of Goethe's Fausř) that right there in the poetry Goethe pro- vides an acute and ecologically quite important critique of what has happened in the modern money economy.</page><page sequence="11">The Pleasures of the Text 207 When we say that Goethe was not obliged to resort to the sub- terfuges of collage, we mean that as a writer he could think through the primary steps of the inquiry he was depicting. The reader is not simply told that thought is taking place, but is in its real presence. Alchemy, which has tagged along after the other sciences like a poor relation or a camp follower, did not scandal- ize or intimidate him. Still less did it titillate him. He was natural philosopher just when he was being poet. In this he was wholly unlike his great admirer and spiritual descendant Thomas Mann, who was the first to admit that he had to "read up" on the arcane lore that appears in Doctor Faustus and Joseph and His Brothers. Where does this place Goethe within the range of doctrines we have been examining? Closer possibly to Webb than to Def- fenbaugh, although as Binswanger's reading confirms, Faust Part II reveals profound misgivings about the "domestication" of na- ture. Etymologically, to domesticate is to make a home out of something or make it serviceable to the home. As a painter, re- gional planner, and landscape designer, Goethe might naturally find this etymological anchoring congenial. All of the attention given to nature in Elective Affinities carries this sense of ordering the domestic space, making the fields and woods and streams of the estate, even the village, safe, so to say, for domesticity. Domus, the Latin, is of course the rough equivalent of the Greek oikos (domestic science, home economics). I suspect that Goethe's problem with these words and their resonances is not that he would want to abjure a fundamental posture of domination, responsibility and generosity (Ritvo's trio) in dealing with the earth and its other inhabitants, but that "home," which did not signify for him a series of unalloyed blessings, may not be exactly what we hope to realize if we ever succeed in establishing what Genesis calls dominion over the earth. Goethe's experience with domesticity, in its humblest house- hold sense of hearth and garden and children, must have led him to see it as a flawed version of human ambition. In Elective Affinities we learn in some detail, through the criss-crossed mis- fortunes of Eduard, Ottilie, Charlotte, and the Captain, what some of these flaws are, and we find that among the most treach- erous is the familiar delusion in personal relations that you can get something for nothing.</page><page sequence="12">208 SOUNDINGS Ralph V. Norman By "something for nothing" the alchemists meant, in the crud- est sense, that you can turn base metal into gold and thereby steal a march upon time and physical circumstance. "Alchemy," writes Binswanger, "is man's attempt to break out of time while still in time - his bid to break free of transitoriness while still in this life." Accordingly the modern money economy is "alchemy by other means": This is what gives today's economy such a huge attractive pull that it is gradually sucking all areas of life into its vortex. It involves the possibility of a continuous growth in production without a corresponding increase in effort expended. In personal and domestic relations "something for nothing" means getting farther than might reasonably be warranted by ef- fort or virtue or other deserving on a certain smile, a good figure, a set of genes, the right sign of the Zodiac, positive vibes. Much of the blessed density and irrationality of domestic life, in Goe- the's day as in our own, accumulates out of gross and poorly ana- lyzed patterns of confidence in such ingredients. As Goethe sadly knew, this confidence is seldom justified and often disastrous. But he was too much of a scientist to let it go at that, as a world- weary maxim of moralists and essayists. Nature is too much in us and with us not to pay some attention to all the clues that are available. The fascinating proclivities of chemical elements, such that they can be said to display "elective affinities" - a severe anthropomorphism, surely - may or may not be of importance in sorting out what we can hope to make of marriages and all lesser alliances. Neither as the author of the novel nor as a natu- ral philosopher does Goethe bring these questions into the clear form of a single doctrine or teaching. Goethe told Eckermann many years after the composition of Elective Affinities that it was of all his works the one that repre- sented the development of a single master conception. Then in letters and conversations with others he proceeded to contradict himself. He avowed and disavowed authorial privileges, he scorned and tolerated eccentric readings. He appeared to relish the ensuing critical disarray. Some of the best minds in European letters have posted entries, including Walter Benjamin in the 20th century, and now Elizabeth Sewell has turned her very con- siderable imaginative powers to a close inspection of the al- chemy, only this time with the advantage of having mastered</page><page sequence="13">The Pleasures of the Text 209 Shakespeare's incursions into that same shady old science in All's Well That Ends Well. If, as Deffenbaugh, Webb, and Babich all seem to agree, the poet is constantly at the business of refuting every merely doctrinaire juxtaposition of the human world and the natural world, Sewell's use of Shakespeare and Goethe gives this correction its fullest and most historically satisfactory elaboration. Sewell does not press the matter, but her studies in Renais- sance and late-18th century esoterica reinforce my impression that technological dabbling in affairs of the spirit has been some- thing of a constant over most of Western history. The more things change, the more they embellish the recognitions with which we began. This is one of the deliverances from cyberspace we input in this issue from Marlena Corcoran, who has been ex- ploring what e-mail means for elective affinities. It has become a commonplace to lament the departure from our lives of that leisured and gracefully reserved quality of personal relations we associate with the art and act of letter writing. The deliriously variable pace of interiority, the many devious corridors of mutu- ality, the great roominess that gave the institution of the private letter all its possibility of delay and retreat and hiding and negoti- ation as permissible and indeed predictable forms of human in- tercourse - these advantages are just plain lost when you can pick up the phone and get an answer instantly. E-mail was con- ceived not as a way of retrieving any of this lost amplitude but as a way of freezing it out, eliminating the escape routes, filling in the inefficient spaces where time might be lost and progress im- peded. Corcoran argues, and does her best to show, that e-mail has some unexpected benefits. Its so-called lag time allows a new form of sensuality, she says, that is somewhere between letter writing and actually being there in the arms of the beloved. Or not so beloved; that's one way e-mail has reintroduced, she claims, the lost element of playful reserve and independence of affect. One hopes this assurance is not like being told that, sure, there are plenty of wolves left in these parts, just take a trip to the zoo. We have said that William Pratťs account of the move Eliot made away from philosophy and into poetry might have been the worst affront of all to an old philosopher living in Oxford and grappling with abuses of the language. Nothing could be further</page><page sequence="14">210 SOUNDINGS Ralph V. Norman off the mark. If Eliot "left" philosophy, he did so in the manner a young man will who knows there is something more and differ- ent to do than what his parents are doing to enhance the family's fortunes. Nothing Eliot says later about Frances Herbert Bradley, to whose philosophy he had devoted the long exertions of his dissertation, indicates a fundamental break with the peculiar sense of the world that ironic gentleman conveyed in Appearance and Reality. We can place Eliot in relation to questions about human being and the environment in no better way than by not- ing how faithfully Eliot follows Bradley not simply in resisting but in arguing down all notions that we can be parts of a "natural" whole. There are such things as wholes, but they are best ren- dered in images, or series of images. If this is collage, it is not the technique we disparaged earlier as the poeťs borrowing of ready- made philosophic or scientific materials. It is rather thinking through and by means of images, each of which is its own route into the center. Elioťs most compelling images, as Pratt has often shown us, deliver always a certain dateable and geographically fixed collo- cation, a place and a time where personal and social ordeal has made its not always outwardly conspicuous mark. Apart from his images of London itself, which deserve more extensive comment, Eliot's places do not yield a generous visual or tactile reward. Lit- tle Gidding, Burnt Norton, East Coker - none of them has much to recommend it to the sensual pilgrim. I notice that at Grantchester, near Cambridge, where the Neo-pagans disported themselves at about the same time Eliot was leaving Oxford, someone has installed the Rupert Brooke Tavern. Not perhaps what Brooke would have wanted, but then he did make quite a shrine out of Grantchester, celebrating it from as far away as Ber- lin. There simply is no comparable celebration of a place, just as a place, in Eliot. Reading Pratt's account here, we can see how it is that Oxford cannot be imagined in his poetry. Sacred stones and hallowed walls and walks there are aplenty, but Eliot did not, I think, believe the city of the mind can be compressed into a single poetic object. If this was true of the city of the mind, it was the more true of any single image of the earth. RVN</page><page sequence="15">The Pleasures of the Text 211 NOTES 1.

After a distinguished undergraduate career at Northwestern, he studied Economics in Berlin in the thirties (he saw the Reichstag burn) and did a World War II stint with Marine Corps Intelligence before earning a Philosophy doctorate at Harvard. A beloved teacher and mentor to stu- dents and colleagues alike, author of substantial books in informal logic and social ethics, Bob had an unerring feel for that absurdly delicious mo- ment at which academics, and whole academies, cross over the line into nonsense. Sometimes into something worse than nonsense; upon occasion he had to speak truth to power, and paid a high personal price. The first time came during the McCarthy era when he refused to sign the Broyles oath required of all university teachers in Illinois, the second when he re- signed his headship at Miami rather than tolerate what he believed to be the unacceptable policies of state universities in Ohio during the troubled season leading up to the spring of 1970. For all this, he was a gentle, good- humored, tolerant man for whom ethics, as no laughing matter, was clearly no less a laughing matter than anything else.
