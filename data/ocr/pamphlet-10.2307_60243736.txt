To the Members of the Free Religious Association. Quite unexpectedly to themselves, and much to their regret, your Committee have been compelled to omit from the nomination for the Presidency the name of one whom we have long had the privilege of electing, and whose administrative service has been so signally able and acceptable to all. It has been beyond our power to induce Mr. Frothingham to change his decision to retire this year from the Presidency of the Association, — a decision prompted, as we learn, by no personal disinclination to serve in that capacity, but solely out of regard for what he deems, mistakenly as we think, its best inter¬ ests. We have been, therefore, under the necessity of seeking a new name for the position. Difficult as has been this task, we hope it may appear to have been wisely performed in the selection made. Prof. Felix Adler is well known as an intrepid, eloquent, and able advocate of the principles of free and universal religion, and of a wide, catholic, and thoroughly earnest culture of humanity. He is already eminent in the ranks of religious and ethical reform. It</page><page sequence="7">seems to us, as it has to other friends prominently identified with our Association, that in him, perhaps more than in any other one we could designate, are fulfilled the conditions we require in a presiding officer. The selection of one who, in the line of his religious descent, comes of another faith than that in which most of us have been reared, is eminently in harmony with the spirit and aim of this Association. We take pleasure, therefore, in presenting as our nominee for the Presidency, for the coming year, Felix Adler, of New York. In the list of Vice-Presidents for the year just passed one vacancy has occurred, caused by the death of Robert Dale Owen. In common with a large circle of friends throughout the land, we are mourners; for in this death comes, not only the loss to mankind of a prominent philanthropist and social reformer, but also to ourselves of an honored member and a valuable officer. To fill this vacancy we have taken, with his kind consent, the name of our retiring President. The announcement of the resignations of John Weiss and Chas. K. Whipple, as members of the Board of Directors, will cause general regret. The names of Rebecca N. Bufpum, of Lynn, and John L. Stoddard, of Boston, have been added to the list to fill the vacancies thus created. With the exceptions now noted, the nominees are the same as those of last year. In closing, we beg permission to express for ourselves, and we doubt not we speak for the Association as well, our warm apprecia¬ tion of the invaluable service rendered by our retiring President during the past years, and to express our hope and desire that he will not cease to cherish as living and active an interest in behalf of our organization in the future as in the past, and to assure him of our best wishes and most fervent benediction. The list of nominees we have the honor to report is as follows: —</page><page sequence="8">OFFICERS. President. FELIX ADLER " '. New York City. Vice-Presidents. RALPH WALDO EMERSON, Concord, Mass.

He should still be ready to serve it in other ways to the best of his ability. But he had great hope and expectation that a new man in that position might bring new vigor and effectiveness to the society; and he most cordially and earnestly commended the choice made by the Committee, and trusted that Mr. Adler would be elected and receive the hearty welcome and co-operation of all members of the Association. The vote was then taken by ballot, and the list of officers presented by the Committee was elected almost unanimously. Mr. Frothingham announced that Mr. Adler was unable to be present at this convention, having an engagement to give a course of lectures in San Francisco, and that he himself had consented to pre¬ side through this meeting. On motion of Mr. C. E. Pratt it was voted that the report of the Nominating Committee be spread in full upon the records as a testi¬ mony of the sense of this meeting concerning Mr. Frothingham's resignation and his valuable services as President during the last eleven years. The Annual Report of the Executive Committee was then read by the Secretary. 2</page><page sequence="10">10 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. To begin this Report at once with a review of the practical work of the Association during the past year, we must say at the outset that the Executive Committee have felt, as in no preceding year, the limited resources of their Treasury. The amount of the collections made at the last annual meeting and the net proceeds of the Social Festival, were much smaller than in previous years. The whole sum proved to be hardly more than sufficient to pay the expenses of the meeting and the cost of publishing the Annual Report. Con¬ sequently, very early in the season, it was found that the Association was in debt to its Treasurer; and, as the Treasurer's Report shows, the subsequent pecuniary receipts of the Association have not yet served wholly to liquidate this debt. By reason of this condition of the Treasury the Committee have abstained from any new enterprises in publication, though several essays have been suggested to them as eminently fit to appear in the series of Tracts printed by the Associ¬ ation. The only publication, therefore, which we have issued within the year is the Report of the last Annual Meeting. The sale of previous publications, however, has continued to about the average extent. Of the Annual Reports there had been quite an accumulation, the numbers on hand reaching back to the year 1872. It was decided to offer these for sale at a very low rate, —five cents apiece, —Tsfyich only a little more than covers the cost of sending them by mail, and is much below the actual cost of printing them. Most of the matter in them is as fresh as when first written; and it was hoped, in this way, that they might be put into more extensive circulation. Quite a considerable number of them have thus been disposed of already, which otherwise would doubtless have remained in our office; and the offer is still before the public. Any persons at this meeting who may desire the back numbers of the Annual Report, either for themselves or to give away, can secure them at that nominal price.</page><page sequence="11">11 The state of the Treasury also made it incumbent to consider the question whether the usual Autumnal Convention should be held. This Convention had become, by the precedent of seven successive years, one of the institutions of the Association, and an institution that seems to have special usefulness in carrying a knowledge of our principles into places where they would not otherwise be likely to go. The desire was strong, therefore, not to abandon the Con¬ vention except under great pressure of financial necessity. And when the favoring opportunity offered to hold a meeting in so desir¬ able a place as New Haven, it was decided to run the pecuniary risk and trust to the future for reimbursements to the Treasury for any outlay required. As has been our custom in regard to the Autumnal Convention, all local expense was met by the friends in New Haven and vicinity; and the collections taken at the Conven¬ tion for the Association partially covered the necessary outlay for the traveling expenses of speakers. The Convention was regarded as eminently a successful one. Some of the discussions were as com¬ plete as any we have anywhere given. The audiences were good, and the newspapers of the city gave generous space to reporting the proceedings. The local conditions of a successful Convention, in a community whose theological antecedents would not naturally adapt it to welcome the Free Religious Association, were in large measure prepared by the good work of the Free Lecture Association at New Haven, which for several seasons, in the face of many discourage¬ ments, has maintained in the city a course of Sunday Evening Free Lectures, which have drawn large assemblies and have discussed religious topics from the standpoint of the largest freedom and fellow¬ ship in religion. The soil was thus all ready to receive the seed which our speakers had to sow. The course of Sunday Afternoon Horticultural Hall Lectures, in Boston, which has been conducted by this Association for a number of years, was continued the past winter. No expense is brought upon the Association as such for these Lectures. The cost, beyond receipts from the moderate fee charged for tickets of admission, is met by a subscription fund guaranteed by individual members and friends of the Association in Boston or vicinity. The course last winter was an interesting one, with a wide variety of topic — Specula-</page><page sequence="12">12 five, Scientific, and Practical. A vigorous attempt was made to have half of the course distinctly scientific, — Science for the people from first-class scientific men ; but the attempt failed in the main from our inability to find a sufficient number of scientific men who could spare the time and strength from their busy lives. The course was constituted as follows : Octavius B. Frothingham, on " The Assail¬ ants of Christianity;" Samuel Johnson, on "Soul of Culture;" John Weiss, on " The Survival of the Fittest; " Reuben Tomlinson, on "The Southern Question, — Is it settled?" Samuel R. Cal- throp, on " The Law of Evolution applied to the Hebrew Faith ; " Carlos C. Carpenter, on " The History of the Sun in Human Thought," illustrated by the Stereopticon; Prof. Edward S. Morse, on "Japanese Ways ; " Wendell Phillips, on " The New Times and their Demands;" AVilliam J. Potter, on " Christianity and Modern Civilization ;'' Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, on " Analysis of a Problem in Evolution,"—illustrated by the Stereopticon. These Lectures did not draw crowds, but the average attendance was equal to that of previous years; and every year the Committee hear of persons attending this course of Lectures to whom they are an important educational influence in their progress out of ecclesiastical narrow¬ ness and superstition into the broad free places of rational belief. And this ends the brief register of the special practical enterprises which the Executive Committee have conducted the past year. Of course it is a very small and humble performance. Compared vvith the work done by some of the ecclesiastical organizations, — as that of the American Tract Society, for instance, with its annual income of over $400,000 and its self-supporting book-publication business of $300,000, — the work looks very small. And if the securing of the objects for which this Association exists depended exclusively on its own special achievements each year, we should have, indeed, little ground for any exchange of congratulations upon the progress of our cause. But it has been the profession of our Association from the beginning that it did not aim to set up any great system of machinery by which certain ends were to be accomplished, but rather to furnish some simple form of organization through which the new free spirit of the times in religious things might voice itself. It has sought more than anything else to plant the standard of a new principle in</page><page sequence="13">13 the history of religious development, — the principle that the claims of all the religions, no less than the claims of all the sects of any one religion, should be brought for judgment before the absolutely free human mind; and that, on the ground of this perfect equality of rights, there may be perfect fellowship in intercourse and aim among persons of differing religious convictions, and practical co-operation for the welfare of humanity. For eleven years the Association has proclaimed and illustrated this idea of equal rights in religion, and of the broad human fellowship based thereon; and we cannot doubt — there are, indeed, some positive evidences — that the presentation and upholding of this idea has had a liberalizing effect upon surrounding public opinion. But we are aware that there are many other agencies working towards the same end,— that through the instrumentality of science, of philosophy, of general literature, of historical investigation, of progressive political ideas and institutions, of commercial enterprise and travel, — in short, that through the chief forces of modern civil¬ ization, — the minds of people are being emancipated out of the limitations of their old forms of religious authority and out of their narrow hostile sectarianisms, into larger views and freer fellowship. Looking, indeed, at the tendencies of modern thought, to which, so far as they concern religious things, we in this Association, trusting earnest thought on any field, would give free room, we may say that the promise of the future after all is more with us, though small be our numbers and meagre our machinery, than with an organization that is bolstering up old traditions, like the American Tract Society, though it have for foundation all the Evangelical Protestant sects of Christendom, and count its income of four hundred thousand dollars a year. Still, it may be questioned whether liberal religious thinkers are not disposed to trust too much to these general and indirect agencies for the promotion of their views, and thereby excuse themselves from the special duties which they may owe to their own convictions. By a natural reaction from the propagandist zeal with which the old dogmatic sects have sought to extend their sway, liberals are in dan¬ ger of becoming apathetic. It has happened too often for humanity's good that the zealot is the bigot; that the religious enthusiast is the religious fanatic; that intensity of religious conviction is in propor-</page><page sequence="14">14 tion to the poverty and contractedness of religious ideas; that the most active theological propagandist is the one who has the most superstitious theology to propagate. It must be confessed that there is some reason for this difference of religious temper in the different nature of the doctrines held by the two parties. Those sects, cer¬ tainly, that profess to believe in the eternal misery of all mankind except such as secure a so-called saving knowledge of Christ, we should naturally expect to be impelled by a never-tiring zeal to spread this knowledge and thus save their friends and neighbors, as many as possible, from this fearful doom. But the difference of belief on this point cannot excuse people of liberal convictions from all zeal in behalf of their own more cheerful views. On the contrary, though not dogmatizing with regard to the hereafter, or not believing that the universe can have such a malignant cruelty at its heart as the endless torment of human souls, yet people of liberal convictions certainly believe that it is a matter of great moment to the happiness and progress of mankind, on this earth, that all such superstitions and degrading doctrines of theology should be dissipated by the light of more rational views. They can but admit that they have a share of responsibility for the condition of present and coming gener¬ ations in this world; and by as much as their own minds and hearts revolt from the irrational and inhuman dogmas that are taught in the name of religion should they burn with enthusiasm to emancipate other souls from bondage to them. Moreover, there seems to be no good reason in the nature of things why a broad-minded man should not have as much enthusiasm for his convictions as a narrow-minded man. He may express his enthusi¬ asm differently, but he need not be destitute of it. There appears no good reason why the liberal thinker should be half-hearted, apa¬ thetic, phlegmatic — if he be really a thinker as well as liberal. He may be serene, but he need not be without ardor. He may burn with zeal, and yet not be a fanatic. He may manifest the utmost devotion and self-sacrifice for his convictions, and yet not be a bigot nor a persecutor. He may most earnestly offer his views for the consideration of others, without being an offensive propagandist. There are numerous examples of genuine enthusiasm among scien¬ tific men, amoung inventors, among philanthropists, among artists;</page><page sequence="15">15 and it is one of the strong elements of success in their careers. Surely there can be nothing in broad and enlightened religious views which of itself should tend to extinguish enthusiasm or to annihi¬ late zeal. If they are the high and needed truths which we profess to believe them to be, our hearts should kindle within us, not indeed to impose them as an authoritative creed upon others, but to make them as free and as common as the atmosphere around us, so that human minds may naturally and freely breathe them in for their own health and the well-being of mankind. And the sweep of the free religious movement is so wide that it presents a variety of aspects of interest to attract the sympathy and co-operation of a great variety of minds. It is continually opening new problems of thought for those who are inclined to philosphical speculation or historical research, while it is in close alliance with social science and philanthropy, offering the practical fields of labor towards which many turn with readier devotion. It covers the rela¬ tions between Church and State and concerns all questions of edu¬ cation ; and hence it involves great problems of political and social interest, some of which are coming rapidly to the forefront of agita¬ tion in this country. It is a movement that calls both for the clear thinker and the earnest actor. It needs the ability of brains, the power of heart, the effective strength of executive deeds. And we in this Association seek to give impulse to this general movement by the creation of public opinion in its favor. The more our hands are upheld by sympathy and the larger the contributions to our treasury, the mightier will be this impulse. The Report was accepted, and the subject-matter of it was opened for discussion by the meeting. Miss Anna C. Garlin, who had been advertised to speak on the Practical Work of Free Religion, was unable, on account of illness, to be present, and no one who was pres¬ ent appeared to have anything to offer on the topic. A few remarks were made by Mr. Hallowell, urging any one who had any criti¬ cisms to make of the Committee's doings, or suggestions as to what might be done, to offer them for the Committee's benefit; and by</page><page sequence="16">16 Mrs. S. B. Otis, who spoke of her gratitude for what this Asso¬ ciation had done and was doing for those who, like herself, had been in bondage to the old creeds and knew personally of the joy of liberation from them. No others seeming inclined to speak, the Chair appointed as a Nominating Committee for next year, Mr. William H. Spencer, Miss Mary C. Shannon, and Mr. J. H. Carter, and the meet¬ ing then adjourned, to re-assemble Friday morning at half-past ten in Beethoven Hall.</page><page sequence="17">17 FRIDAY MORNING. The Convention was called to order in Beethoven Hall, on Friday, at 10.30 a.m., by 0. B. Frothingham, who addressed the audience as follows: — ADDRESS OF 0. B. FROTHINGHAM. Ladies and Gentlemen,— In the absence of the newly-elected President of the Association, Mr. Felix Adler, who is delivering at present a course of lectures on Free Religion at San Francisco, I take the chair again this morning, as has been my wont for so many years. It would not seem natural for me not to preside at a meet¬ ing of the Free Religious Association, having done it for so long; and perhaps the absence of Mr. Adler may be taken in a congratu¬ latory mood by myself, inasmuch as it allows me not to desert the post quite so speedily and hastily. A year ago, it was said that the Free Religious Association had done its work, had secured its objects, and might now retire. The object of the Association being liberty in the sphere of religion, that liberty, we were told, was already secured, and the Association, hav¬ ing attained its object, might disband with a good grace. But the battle of the Association, so far from being finished, is as yet scarcely begun. It is true that the idea of the Association has become famil¬ iar to a large number of people all over the country. We have been reported in the papers; we have held conventions in different parts of the United States; and now our idea, so far as it is an idea, simply a speculative thought, is tolerably well'recognized. That we have done all this is more than we claim; the Association only claims to be abreast with the working liberal influence of the age and country. We represent the institutions of America, the free institutions of America; and the idea of a free religion, which is intended to disenchant all religions of their authority, to put them all on one level, and to compel them to show their worth by their fruits, is but the superficial aspect of our labor. The idea, I say, has become familiar; I may also say it is recognized and appreciated in 3</page><page sequence="18">18 unexpected quarters. We are all perfectly well aware of what Dean Stanley and the Broad Churchmen of England are saying and doing, — how, in their province, they take precisely the ground that we take here; and we find at home orthodox clergymen, even, who stand at the opposite extreme from some of us in the matter of per¬ sonal opinion, still acceding to the validity of our enterprise in dethroning ecclesiasticism and dogmatism. It was but the other day that one of the most prominent and able Baptist clergymen of the city of New York, to whom one of his parishioners was expressing surprise and consternation at having heard that one of his friends occasionally went to hear on Sunday morning the President of the Free Religious Association, — a man who was supposed by this speaker to be undermining, not only all religion, but all morality, — quietly turned and said, " There are a great many things to be done. This evil of sectarianism is a gigantic one, and Mr. Frothingham seems to be doing his part towards removing it." That was a recog¬ nition on the part of a man whom I never saw, to my knowledge, and who perhaps never saw me and would not know me if he met me in the street. Yes, the idea has-so much of common sense, carries so much of liberal emotion and sentiment and earnest purpose with it, that every man who is a working man, to whatever church belong¬ ing, who is at all in sympathy with the currents of the generation, the drift of the country, is at once sensible of its validity and impor¬ tance. Therefore I say that the idea, as a speculative idea, is tolera¬ bly familiar to the people of this country. But it is not as a speculative idea that we press it, or have ever pressed it: the future of the Association aims at building on the idea and carrying it out in all its practical applications. It is a great mistake to suppose that any form of religion, especially any insti¬ tuted form of religion, remains on the surface of society as a supeifi- cial thing. It works into the very roots of society; it has something to do with every social relation, with every living arrangement of things. Christianity has been the religion of the highest type of civilized man for nearly two thousand years. In that time, has it remained on the surface of society has it been simply an idea It has exercised a controlling power over all the relations of mankind ; it has gone into the family; it has controlled the schools ; it has dic¬ tated the school-books, and the methods of education; it has</page><page sequence="19">19 influenced and swayed and directed the rearing of children, the con¬ duct of family life ; until now, without knowing anything about it, without thinking of it at all, men are Christians. Now we have the duty before us of subsoiling the whole moral and religious and intel¬ lectual sentiment of the time, going down to the roots of things. In that sense wre are radicals, and in that sense alone,—going to the roots of things, and not pulling things up by the roots. Therefore I say there is no living question of the present age that does not touch us as one of our questions: the labor question; the woman question, in all its bearings; the question of the education of chil¬ dren ; the administration of domestic nurture and discipline; the construction of the home; questions of marriage, political ques¬ tions, social questions of all kinds, — all these are our questions, pre-eminently, because our idea, reaching as it does to the vital centres of all practical reforms, touches those immediately. Our work hitherto has been chiefly expository; we have dealt largely in scholastic matters, we have talked about other religions, and dif¬ ferent forms of religion, and the authority upon which they rested ; we have criticised the Bible and sacred institutions, not in the spirit of destruction, but in the spirit of conservatism, aiming simply at this, — not at weakening Christianity itself, not at overthrowing any system of things, not at overturning any instituted form of religion which rested upon an honest basis and could vindicate itself; but simply aiming to blot out every form of ecclesiasticism and dogmatism and spiritual and intellectual oppression. Let the Roman Church, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Churches, do their work on their own principles in their own way as well as they can ; let them allow their neighbors to do their work as well as they can. This is all we have asked hitherto of them. But questions of tremendous import are looming up in the near future and pressing upon us for disposal. The working-men are gathering; the women are holding their conventions; there is not a question touching family nurture, the rearing of children, schools,— public schools, private schools,— the writing of books, that is not our question. And now the Associ¬ ation steps to the front and says, " Let my voice be heard in answer to these practical problems." One thing I have it on my mind to say, — that this Association is, in spirit, in mode of action, in purpose, conservative. All men like</page><page sequence="20">20 to consider themselves conservative ; they like to be ranked among organizers, among preservers, not among destructives; nobody likes to be called a destructive. We all believe that we are builders ; if a man does not feel that he is a builder, we say, " Let him begone " We must build, and the only question is, on what idea do we build But the man Avho builds on an idea, on a principle, on a valid senti¬ ment, is a conservative, — no matter what his theory may be, no matter what his idea of the creative power may be, no matter what his construction of history may be, he builds, if he has his soul occu¬ pied with a constructive and regenerating idea. Conservatism is a relative term : it is a question always of what is one conservative of the letter or of the spirit of the form or of the idea of the book or of the sentiment of the institution or of the principle What do you conserve, — something that supports, or something that is supported Do you conserve a vital and indwelling power or principle, or do you conserve some question that lies on the surface of society " Conservative " means one thing in England, another thing in America; one thing in Vienna, another thing in New York ; one thing in Berlin, and another thing in Boston. The radical in one place may be the conservative in another; the conservative in one region may be the destructive and anarchist in another. The question is, what do we conserve Now, the Free Religious Association claims that it stands upon the constructive, central idea of America. We claim simply to voice, in the highest application, on the highest level, the American idea,— the idea of liberty. The conservative thought of America is liberty ; the conservative thought of Europe is absolutism. The conservative in Europe is the man who maintains existing institutions in society, because those institutions are built upon the idea that there is a spiritual authority, by virtue of a transmitted revelation, in the church, and that the king rules by divine right as the temporal repre¬ sentative of Jehovah. Here, the cardinal constructive and recon¬ structive force is liberty. He is the anarchist who limits liberty; he is, the destructive who, in whatever form, on whatever pretense, in whatever spirit, cramps the spirit of freedom. Thus the churchman, who plants himself upon an authoritative revelation, is an anarchist; the orthodox believer, who believes that his creed is written in an inspired book, and that no other books of the world are inspired, is a</page><page sequence="21">21 destructive. Every person who assumes, under one form of words or another, the right to dominate, to oppress and control any class of human beings, intellectually, morally, or spiritually, is in America an anarchist. We therefore claim to be conservatives because we believe in liberty, in all liberty, in liberty pure and simple ; and we say Build, — build all your structures, your churches, your houses of legislation, your schools, your homes, — upon this principle, well understood and thoroughly grounded in human nature, comprehen sively interpreted and organized, — upon the principle of liberty. When you are able to do this, then you are able to be through-and- through Americans ; and until you are able to do it, you are half- and-half Americans, — you are a little bit American and a little bit European; this part of you is Boston, is New York, is Cincinnati, is Chicago; that part of you is London, or Berlin, or Vienna, or Rome. Now, we want to be whole men and whole women, — nothing less than that. Theodore Parker was a constructive; Voltaire, whose name is on all lips now, — a name coming to honor in these days, as it is rightly pronounced and fairly interpreted, — was a builder ; Thomas Paine in his day and generation was a conservative, not a radical, because he went to the heart of the American idea and built on the principle of liberty. And not Thomas Paine and his school alone; the great statesmen, the far-seeing politicians, who founded the insti¬ tutions of this country, built on the principle of liberty, — upon our principle. Jefferson built upon it; Washington built upon it: we have their written and printed words to that effect; and we stand by their side, as they stand by ours. They are our backers. We are all of one fellowship ; and we, the members of the Free Religious Association, reach out our hands to the great thinkers and liberators of the past, to the great thinkers and liberators of the present, of whatever church, of whatever society, of whatever creed, and say, " You belong to us; you have got a glimpse of the idea that we cherish, and we are all working as one fraternity toward the same immortal result." I say this out of conviction. For my part I am conservative ; and I believe that every honest man and woman, who really appreciates the constructive force of an idea, is conservative, because all great ideas preserve.</page><page sequence="22">22 Now., we may seem to have been destructive simply from the cir¬ cumstance that the Society was founded and has been conducted hitherto by men and women who have belonged to the radical wing, or the radical body of independents in religion. This was a mere accident; it did not touch the core of our thought; it did not touch the centre of our principle ; and the time will come when the ladies and gentlemen who have conducted this movement hitherto will quietly lay aside their task, and there will be a pressure of peo¬ ple who have hitherto called themselves conservatives to come and head the work, — the work of this Association, of the Labor League, and the National Liberal League, — of all movements which now are looked upon askance by men who think them in the hands of radicals and destructives. I say the work of this Association, instead of being finished, is hardly begun. It will not be finished until there is a complete divorce between religion as instituted and all secular human affairs, — until human affairs are conducted on their own natural and rea¬ sonable principles. As long as a man like Charles Bradlaugh, in London, is persecuted because he is an atheist; as long as a man like D. M. Bennett, of New York, is persecuted because he is a come-outer; as long as any men or women in Boston and other cities are kept under the eye of surveillance on the ground that they are preaching blasphemy because they do not preach the orthodox opin¬ ions, — so long will the Free Religious Association have all its work to do. So long as there is any mist of confusion in the public mind between free thinking and free living, between heresy and immoral¬ ity, so long will the Free Religious Association be called upon to come to the front and make its earnest protest against such a barba¬ rous confusion of ideas, and insist upon it that things shall be rightly defined, shall be fairly understood, and that principles shall be acted upon, not prejudices. The Free Religious Association has yet to enter upon one phase, which is the great phase of all power, — the phase of institution. The world is controlled, practically, by institutions. Thinkers change institutions gradually, playing upon them by their knowledge, their wit, their -courage ; but the mass of mankind move with the current of institutions. What are institutions? They are ideas to which people have become habituated, — ideas that have worked their way</page><page sequence="23">23 into the common daily life of mankind and are accepted without question, without misgiving, without protest, by young and old, by wise and by foolish, by strong and by weak. The popular religion, Evangelical or Protestant Christianity, has worked its way so into the roots of social life, that social life goes on according to its require¬ ments, without a misgiving. Children are born, nurtured, taught, enter into manhood, go into business, conduct political affairs, on cer¬ tain principles which are prescribed by the Christian system. It never occurs to them to go to the root of the principles and ask whether they will bear investigation. They have lived in them; the life of generation after generation is born into them. The institutions go on, while the individuals pass away. The states¬ man, the politician, the 'philosopher, the reformer, the leader, dies, disappears, is forgotten. It makes no difference : the great ocean preserves its equilibrium, though the waves flash and fade on its sur¬ face. The institutions of a country control the country when those who upheld them and those who protested against them are gone. Not until the idea that is at the centre of the Free Religious Associ¬ ation shall have become instituted, — until children-are born into it, drink it in with their mother's milk, — until it writes the school- books, controls the education, prescribes the curriculum at universi¬ ties, — until it lies at the bottom of all political affairs, — not until then will the full force and pregnancy of the idea of the Free Reli¬ gious Association be understood; then it will be. The question of to-day is, shall we make it thus understood shall we do what we can to organize Free Religion shall it be any longer speculation, any longer a mere notion, a dream, a vision or shall it be a working fact It is worth any man's while to give his life to such a work as this ; and though we may see but one application of it at a time, and the idea may break upon us very slowly, in little shocks of surprise, still, by working our way into it, little by little, we shall learn finally what it is. 1 learn something new about it every day. Although I have been the President of this Free Religious Association for eleven years, I understand the idea better this very moment than ever before. I am talking myself into a better understanding of the idea than I had five years ago. It is one of those ideas, vast, preg¬ nant, immense, that holds generations in its embrace. We shall pass away: the idea will not. Young men and young women will come</page><page sequence="24">24 forward and take it up and live in it, though they cannot explain it; and the government will gi'adually be conformed to it, politics will be under its eye, and it will shape the education of generation after generation. This is what we are thinking of to-day ; and, in view of this, we have selected a President who is himself trying the experiment, among others, of educating children, young men and women, in the idea of Free Religion, so that as they grow up they will take these ideas in as simply and purely as any ideas have ever been taken in ; and we have invited here to-day, from New York, a representative of the " Society of Humanity," a society which is engaged in doing this very thing, — organizing the constructive principle of Free Religion, in the city of New York. The discussions this morning, and running all through the day for the matter of that, will turn upon these problems, — namely, how shall we organize, put on its feet, make a working, practical power this idea of the Free Religious Association I congratulate the Society on its growth, on the spread of its idea, — an idea that.is contagious, because it strikes people who hear it as being the American idea in the department of religion. Only let us be true to it; let us give our hearts to it; let us give our souls to it; and it will be more than an idea. It will take our children and our children's children into its arms, and will nurture them as beauti¬ fully as the old faith in its day nurtured its sons and daughters. This is my introductory word this morning, and it is also my part¬ ing word as the President of the Association; but not until my heart ceases to throb, not until my mind ceases to think, will my interest in the Association, my readiness to help it, abate one jot. I am committed to this cause. It is the old anti-slavery cause in a new aspect; the same people take it up who fought that terrific war against slavery a generation ago. I came in at the end of that battle and had a little share of the smell of the smoke ; but I see before me veterans in that holy war. Those are the men, those are the women, who come to our platform, whose names are on our list of Vice-Presidents, who are the speakers at our conventions, — because it is the same thought. Then it was the emancipation of a race from a cruel thraldom; now it is the emancipation of the human mind, the human reason, the human soul, from a thraldom which is more crushing, because it is</page><page sequence="25">25 more biting, comprehensive and radical. Therefore, this Free Reli¬ gious Association summons to its banner every true and loyal lover of liberty, every true and faithful lover of his kind, being perfectly sure that " the day of small things" will be the generation of great ones, and that the cause that now creeps and stumbles and totters and falls will be the cause that carries its triumphant march far into the future. Now I have the special pleasure of introducing to you Mr. George William Curtis, of New York, one of our Vice-Presidents, whose engagements, unfortunately, have hitherto prevented him from speak¬ ing on our platform, though his heart has always been with us, — a man whose steel was tried in that anti-slavery war, and who is per¬ fectly willing that its temper should be felt in this. ADDRESS OF GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, — I have at this time no speech to make, but .1 could not be in the city, knowing that the Association was to hold its convention, without showing myself upon this platform, to thank you for the honor which you have so constantly conferred upon me in placing my name among your Vice-Presidents. In accordance with the remarks which Mr. Frothingham has already made, I do not, of necessity, accept this honor as a sign of com¬ munity of faith, but of spirit; it does not mean, necessarily, that we think alike, but that we think honestly; and honest thinking is as hard a task as any man or woman in this country is likely to set themselves. The tenden 'y of society is necessarily to conformity. Intellectual independence in religion, in politics, in any branch of human thought or interest, leads to non-conformity; consequently, reformers are sim¬ ply those who do not conform. Undoubtedly the aspects of reform are often distasteful, are often unseasonable, are often even repulsive, to men and women of educa¬ tion, of refinement, of a high and cultivated taste. And yet, except for that spirit of intellectual independence which it is the central object of this Society to promote and encourage, Quakers would to-day be hung on Boston Common, and the man who should ques¬ tion the right of the State to hang them would be driven from the State in exile. 4</page><page sequence="26">26 Now, the principle of conformity to-day expresses itself in a different form from the halter or the axe. Conformity to-day denounces the reformer as an atheist, as an infidel, as a heretic. You will grant, surely, ladies and gentlemen, that thisjs a much less offensive form of opposition than the earlier one ; it partakes rather of the method of the man who, not liking the look of his antagonist's fists, con¬ tented himself with making faces at his sister. And yet you will also agree that this principle has made immense progress, for surely it is much better to be called an infidel, an atheist, a heretic, by men who in their hearts still approve and respect you, than it is to be hung on Boston Common by those who sincerely believe that you are " a limb of Satan." And the same thing is equally true in the sphere of politics. The tendency in political life in this country is equally to a rigorous con¬ formity. Party despotism wields a scourge of scorpions, and the man who ventures in the least to differ from the dogma of his party may take his choice between being denounced as a traitor or derided as a sorehead. Hence you see whence springs the difficulty of which I speak, of honest thinking. It is that all the great prizes in life, the great prizes which society holds out to allure the ambition of youth, are mainly given to conformity and withheld from dissent, and conse¬ quently every young man is under the strongest femptation, either to think as other men think, or else to conceal his thought. The intel¬ lectual demoralization is sure, and is evident. Thi3 was seen forty years ago, by one of the most illustrious men that this country has borne, and who stands in the list of our Vice- Presidents. In his address to the young men at Dartmouth Col¬ lege,— one of those addresses which first revealed to his genera¬ tion the presence of a great reforming genius, — that man said these words : " Gentlemen, when you shall say, ' As others do, so will I: I renounce, I am sorry for it, my early visions; I must eat the good of the land and let learning and romantic expectations go till a more convenient season,' — then dies the man in you ; then once more perish the buds of art, and poetry, and science, as they have died already in a thousand thousand men. The hour of that choice is the crisis of your history. See that you hold yourself fast by the intellect." He spake those words; he is now an old man; he has kept his</page><page sequence="27">27 faith with himself, he has kept his faith with the dreams of his youth; he is to-day a leader in the army of the liberation of humanity. No man, in his life, in his character, in his career, more fully embodies the spirit which it is the object of this Society to cultivate, and in the constellation of American greatness there is no name that shines with a serener, a purer, a more permanent lustre, than that of our Vice- President, Ralph Waldo Emerson. The President. Now I have the pleasure of introducing to you Thaddeos B. Wakeman, of New York, who comes as the repre¬ sentative of the Society of Humanity there. ESSAY BY THADDEUS B. WAKEMAN. The Religion of Humanity. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, — I never felt as now the consolation there is in the fact that the naked and undraped statue reveals most effectively the strength and beauty of the human form. For thus I may hope that from the very defects and naked¬ ness of any presentation of our subject that I can make, The Reli¬ gion of Humanity may stand forth more life-like and effective in its own strength than it would from any adornment. Let us therefore, with such sincerity and breadth of mind, and in as few words, as we can, endeavor to call attention to the subject in three of its aspects: — 1. What the Religion of Humanity really is. 2. What concern you have with it as Free Religionists. 3. In what way it may be organized and cultivated upon American soil. As to the first question, What is the Religion of Humanity if I should give a short, concrete definition, it would be simply this: It is the Subjective Synthesis. If you ask further explanation of this term, I would translate a little aphorism of Goethe, perhaps the wisest of men, which may help to show what depth of meaning lurks under this philosophic phrase. The words of Goethe are, " We know of no world but in relation to Man ; we wish and will no Art except as an expression of that relation." (Wir wissen von keiner Welt, als im Bezug auf den Menschen; wir wollen keine Kunst, als die ein Abdruck dieses Bezugs ist.)</page><page sequence="28">T 28 If you, ask futher, for an explanation of this aphorism, I must refer you to its foundation, which is none other than the fundamental law of all modern science and philosophy, — the great culminating product of all the ages of thought and experience, — the law of the relativity of human knoivledge. Many of you will remember how Sir William Hamilton, and after him Herbert Spencer, have collected into a grand galaxy of honor to the human race the names of those who, from Protagoras and Aristotle down to Kant and Comte, have done so much to illustrate and to make ever clearer the gradually growing* conception of that doctrine. Since the time of Kant, Hamilton, Mill, Spencer, Huxley, Bain, and indeed all of those who have had any lead or influence in general scientific thought, have one after another made stronger and more irrefragable the conviction that this philosophical doctrine is a law of science underlying all human knowl¬ edge, thought and effort. Now under the light of this law what is the meaning of Goethe's aphorism The meaning is, that we only know this world about us as it is related to us ; that we know only phenomena, we know our perceptions of things, and call them the world. What the world may be beyond its relations to us, and our perceptions of it, we have no capacity for, nor means of, learning. The consequences of this con¬ clusion are of the greatest importance in regard to the subject before us. It is this conclusion that points to Man as the connecting mind by which all phenomena are construed together. The nucleus Man is the centre around which the knowable world hangs, to which it all comes; for it is the human perceptive power by which all phenomena are co-ordinated into the whole as a world. The importance of this lat¬ ter proposition calls for a fuller consideration. We must take this law of relativity for granted as the foundation of all knowable science and philosophy, and, if the Religion of Humanity follows from it, we shall have no alternative but to recognize and to conform to the fact. That those who have established this law have failed to deduce or verify all its consequences, is only to say that they discovered a larger continent than they were able to explore, and that they left that work to their successors. As the fundemental fact, then, we know the world about us only as phenomenal, that is, only as it appears to us. We have only our, i.e., a human, conception of its properties and relations. The primary or permanent, as well as the secondary J</page><page sequence="29">29 or transient, properties of matter, and also time and space, — that is, succession and extension, — upon final analysis, are found to be modes of our sensation and apprehension. The growth of Scientiflc Psychology h'as in this way been a con- tinous victory of the Experiential Philosophy, and a confirmation of the maxim,— Nihil in intellects non prius in seusil. But the greatest of these triumphs has been the reply of Sociology to the objection Leibnitz made to this maxim when he retorted, as it is said " with the applause of Europe," Nisi intellectus ipse!—the point of the objection being, that the intellect itself was prior to or independent of experience, and had forms and capacities of thought and even necessary truths which transcended all experience. The answer to this has come from the light that Social Science and Comparative Psychology have thrown upon the genesis and history of the human mind and its conceptions. What of these appeared inexplicable from the study of the individual, or of one stage of civilization, yields to the historical vision that studies the whole human race as one grand individual growing through the ages, and retaining by unconscious heredity the results of the various stages of its progress. In his con¬ tact and struggle with his environment, Man has carried away in his inmost and instinctive nature much that we can find no origin for now, unless we look deeply and broadly into what we may call the embryology of the race. Take, for instance, the explanation of the conscience, or moral sense. It seemed at first wholly inexplicable, and therefore, of course, a divine intuition, or faculty of supernatural origin. But this was so only from its individual and partial examination. Under the histor¬ ical analysis of Spencer, Darwin, Tyler and Fiske, its origin from the natural selection and heredity of the altruistic feelings, that is, those beneficial to society, is made out as plainly as the physiological origin and evolution of the human eye or hand. In a word, there seems to be nothing in the individual man physically, mentally, morally or even spiritually, that does not become intelligible under this race- explanation when thoroughly applied. The next step is to inquire how the questions of human existence and knowledge appear under this law of relativity supplemented by natural selection and race-heredity. The answer from the law of</page><page sequence="30">30 relativity must be that man is capable of knowing the world only according to the experience of his race. The collective continuous Humanity is, therefore, the first and main factor, the nominative case, or subject, in any thorough attempt to parse or understand the world in which we live. The verb " is," or existence itself, is the activity or experience of this subject, and the world around us is the object, — the accumulated results of that experience. This is the ground of our faith and optimism. The never-failing laws are parts of our¬ selves. " The Cosmos is the champion of the Just" (vns'n^axo^ ycio 6 xo^/xoi tarl 8ty.aiati&gt;. — Apocrypha, Wisdom, 16, 17), is the wonder¬ ful sentence of the Wisdom of Solomon, to which modern science gives a meaning far beyond the reach of ancient thought. But it follows that man's explanation of the world can never be more than his own explanation. His philosophy, therefore, is his subjective synthesis, and can never truly be more until he can learn to think beyond relations, as a bird would fly without wings or air. Our science is our human reading and co-ordination of phenom¬ ena as they appear to us. The centre of all of the sciences can therefore be no other than this continuous Man which remains as the subject, the very and only nucleus of the knowable Cosmos, which he arranges in order around him, as he perceives and needs and wills. All the sciences, that is, all laws and relations, centre in him and are knowable only as his sensations, thoughts and feelings. In the grand continuous social organism Humanity we, therefore, find the convergence of the external world, as far as we can know it under the law of the relativity of human knowledge. But if this is true of the material and biological worlds, it is, if possible, more decisively true and important in the domain of human societies and of moral endeavor. For this continuous human organ¬ ism, now embracing our planet, has gradually incorporated into its continuity and solidarity the past ages and all of the present peoples and nations. It has become a grand unity, being first united emo¬ tionally in the sentiment of the humane, then by commerce, religion, and international law, until now it distinctly aims at the conscious control of itself and of the earth under the reign of law. It is the great organism, the greatest Being, known to us. From it we have come, and have received all that we have inherited or acquired, and in it we literally live and move and have our being.</page><page sequence="31">31 Under the light of such considerations the deeper meaning of Goethe's aphorism opens up to us. If we ask now, What is the Religion of Humanity? the law of the relativity of human knowledge answers, that it is the sum of all of the relations and emotions, infinite, cosmic and human, that converge in Man as the centre and heart of the whole knowable world. These relations are theoretically known and summed up in the word " Science," and practically, emotionally and morally in the word "Duty." "To know the true in order to do the good," is, therefere, the fundamental maxim of the New Faith. Its creed is Science, or the Positive Philosophy, formed by co-or¬ dinating the special sciences in the order in which the forces are correlated through the material world as they pass from the infinite space through the domains which constitute astronomy, physic, chem¬ istry, biology, sociology, up to the individual man himself. Thus the order of the sciences builds a philosophy that binds the Cosmos into one intelligible whole lying around its great perceptive centre, Man. Its religious and moral base is this organic Humanity whose good, welfare and glory become the mainspring of life and duty. Its future Heaven is the knowable, realizable Heaven on earth whose existence is warranted and even anticipated in the laws of the Cosmos and of Man himself. The Religion of Humanity, in a word, is that religion which counts Man as the centre of the world, and solves all relations by reference to that centre. It is, therefore, the true and scientific, because the only verifiable, religion of the human race ; and, strange as it may at first appear, it constitutes, when understood, the highest satisfaction for the religious emotions and instincts. It does so because it includes and combines all emotion, whether aris¬ ing from the It/finite, or the Cosmos, or Humanity. Let us turn to one illustration of this universality. Your society professes most worthily to encourage "the scientific study of man's religious'nature and history." Yo,u have taken your stand upon the religious nature of Man, pure and simple, outside of any particular ' creed or faith. In order to have religion free, you recognize and represent it as emancipated from the limitations of special creeds and conditions of age or race. The Religion of Humanity meets you upon that ground in the fullest reconciliation and fellowship. As the greater includes the less, this universal faith includes all other faiths,</page><page sequence="32">32 as having in them some inherent truths, scientific, emotional or moral. They are not only stages of evolution, but relatively inevitable as components of the Religion of the great social family of Man. All of these religions come from the attempts of Man to get some liveable theory about the three grand divisions of the world. These are, (1) The Infinite, or the Unknown or Unknowable; (2) The Cosmos, or World about him; and, lastly, (3) Himself. He wonders at them, and asks the three great religious questions: Whence am I? Whither go I What should I do When the emphasis is upon the Unknown or the Infinite, religion becomes anthropomorphism, and we have theology; when upon the Cosmos, we have fetichism, materialism or cosmism; when upon man himself, mere selfishness and fear are the results. None of these solutions were or are complete, or able to withstand the growth of the race and the riddling work of the intellect. Entire VHomme et le Monde, il faut V Humanite. Between man and the world there lies (and there is need o/) Humanity. These solving words of Comte bring solution and harmony in religion, as we have shown that they do in philosophy and science. The col¬ lective Man and his history has been the missing factor, which once discovered reduces our chaos to cosmos in every domain of thought, feeling or action. To further illustrate the completeness of the religious bearings of this subjective synthesis we may recall the old and familiar myth of our Scandinavian ancestors, — the tree Igdrasil, the tree of existence, or of life itself. In that tree you have a picture and symbol of this Positive Philosophy of which the Religion of Humanity is the flower. The roots of it run deeply down and out of sight into the Infinite. But it does not undertake to comprehend or anthropomorphise the infinite : it lives in it, and its roots are buried in it; and as with all healthful growing trees, they must remain ever buried beyond our sight. You cannot by shallow anthropomorphic philosophies explore those roots, nor disturb them, unless you imitate the ignorance instead of the wisdom of the true husbandman. For the knowable world we live in is founded upon and grows out of the Infinite, which is thus truly and freely recognized, but not anthropomorphised. Pursuing our simile, our world or existence is divided, tree-like, into three great divisions, roots, body, and head or top. Each of</page><page sequence="33">33 these divisions has been the cause of great emotions, and has there¬ fore been the fountain of religions. All of these religious elements remain in the Religion of Humanity. For example, those emotions which take their rise from the conception of the Infinite, where the roots of this great life-tree are hidden, are chastened and corrected, but are not destroyed in the New Faith. Those emotions were child¬ ish in the childhood of the race, and their anthropomorphic forms still are so to the intellect, but their moral ideals were anticipations of the Humanity which was to appear, and the feelings of awe and won¬ der are only enlarged as they change into that reverence and inquiry which has discovered and placed the Cosmos between Man and the Infinite ; and so veiled the Infinite forever from his sight. But next out of that Infinite rises the world of matter, which may be called the great trunk of this tree of existence, for it is the basis of the great material and cosmic sciences and emotions. In that domain we have Materialism blended with cosmic emotions, which has become a religion illustrated of old by Epicurus and Lucretius, and most practically and gloriously in modern times by the triumphs of observation and experiment, giving us the arts and inventions and securing civilization forever. But in these latter days this religion, under the law of evolution, has risen still higher, and includes Biol¬ ogy as the grand science of animal and vegetable life. Thus the Cosmist combines with all that on which the Materialist formerly grounded his faith the additional conception of the laws of the vari¬ ations which we see in all organic growth, whether in plant, animal or man. That conception of growth, combined with and supplement¬ ing the old materialistic theories, gives us a very complete solution or religion of the external world, and even of man considered in his ani¬ mal relation to that world. But Cosmism can never be a completed religion for man, in that it subordinates man to the world. In other words it can have no Morality, for it has no Sociology. This latter science is the indispensable foundation of any thorough knowledge of human nature, wherein the moral conception can for the first time appear. Humanity is the only basis of Morality. Rising, then, above the material and vegetable and animal domains, the grand history of the human race, in the science of Sociology, rep¬ resents the branches and head of our tree of life. In that domain we find collective mankind resting upon and fed by the vegetable and 5</page><page sequence="34">34 animal life below them. They are, as we have before shown, the great explanation of all. To them the life and sap of the tiee runs. They are the nucleus wherein all knowledj. entered, and in which it is combined and elaborated for the.fruit. But this is not all. Rising above the collective Man, the very flower and fruit of this tree of life blossoms out as the individual man. It is his relations to the collective Man, or Sociology at large, that gives us the sciences of Morality, Ethics, and iEsthetics. You may call these the sciences of the individual, if you will. They are a little domain of themselves, based upon the science of Sociology, out of which they have their real growth. Here is the outcome, the product, the flower and seed, of our Igdrasil tree, of our completed existence ; asShelley sings it, — " I am the eye with which the Universe Beholds itself, and knows itself divine ; All harmony of instrument or verse, All prophecy, all medicine, are mine, All light of Art or Nature: to my song, Victory and praise in their own right belong." Taking in this way the order of the correlation of the forces, we find that this life-tree or system is genetically bound together as a scientific, philosophic, and emotional whole. We have woven for us by the law of correlation itself the basic creed of the Religion of Humanity. It is the subjective synthesis of science itself. It includes all the acquirements of the ages past, and all, so far as method and hope are concerned, which it is possible for man's facul¬ ties to know and to understand in the future. But what becomes of the individuals, — those single leaves and flowers that blossom on the tree of life and fall They seem to be lost, but they fall only to make room for the current of life itself. Nay, they restore it by their fall. They are the material out of which the life-tree itself is ever growing. Every human life is one fibre in that tree. Each day in every life is but a cell in that fibre ; every aspect of life is but some phase in which the single life stands related to that great organic whole, composed of his race and its con¬ tinuous life. He, the part, is constantly fed by the sap, — the blood of human life; and that blood is the very essence, the concrete form, of the Religion of Humanity.</page><page sequence="35">35 Now, if we take in the breadth of the view we attempted to illus¬ trate, it is evident we have reached what we may call the universal and integral faith; for it includes the foundations of all of the other re¬ ligions. All the religious emotions that man connects with the Infinite are there; all those which he connects with the material world and the cosmos are included; and also those which relate to human society and the individual. It is a Faith that really includes and incorpo¬ rates all the good that other religions have produced and do, and gives them an historical relation in which they may still be recognized as relative parts of the whole, and therefore as still having services to perform in the progress of society. A majority of the world are to-day Fetich-worshipers, and such they will probably remain for ages; and so with the other relative stages of growth that form the steps in the social and moral advance of civilized life. But they all have their recognition in this general law of the progress of human¬ ity ; they have not only their position, but their uses and duties are recognized. One of the grand admonitions of this integral faith is that it may be wise to preserve those relative practices and institutions, and the consequent benefits which may be derived from them, among those peoples who are still in the lower stages of growth. It teaches the importance of making education in science and civilization the main object with them, and remonstrates against the murderous cruelty of bringing the lower tribes and peoples into direct conflict and competition with the higher, who have had the advantages of ages of experience in morals and civilization. This lesson, so much needed in the treatment of the colored race and the Indian tribes, is one of the first that the universal faith lays before us; and, unless it is regarded, by the inevitable laws of Sociology those races must disappear from our country, and in time from the face of the earth. This reference to the uncivilized races is but one of numberless applications. Indeed, there is no department of human life or endeavor, from the sublime Statesmanship, that must order the future of our planet, down to the simplest act or thought of the individual man, that dees not fall within its domain, — the domain of law. "The Universal Religion is necessarily destined," says Comte, " to regulate human life, whether personal, domestic, or civil, by bringing them all into their true relations to Humanity."</page><page sequence="36">36. These true relations are determined by the laws to which mankind are found to be subject, and these laws are used or modified by human volition and activity, for the welfare of the whole race, in order to achieve on earth the Heaven of which those very laws, when completed by our wills, give us the surest promise and pledge. We may now, with perhaps some appreciation of the words, return to our first question, What is the Religion of Humanity It is the recognition in heart, head and life, of the relations by which man is bound to his fellow-men and to the world ; it shows those relations to be knowable only by the recognition of Humanity standing between the individual and the world as the common interpreter of both ; that this religion is true and universal, including the whole race and all time; that it is at once analytic and constructive, ever solving, in order to bind up the ragged edges of our existence ; that, therefore, by the law of natural selection, its adherents, however named, will in time certainly find the destiny of the race on earth more and more falling into their hands for solution and guidance. How shall they be prepared for so great a responsibility These considerations brings us to our second question, What con¬ cern have Free Religionists with this Universal Faith, this Religion of Humanity We answer, Very great, and for many reasons. The first reason is, that it is in substance the realization of their aspiration and object. It is free religion, in that it is the actual, organic, constructive, or affirmative fulfillment of the religious senti¬ ment when emancipated from the dogmas and creeds. When Free Religionists think far enough into this subject to discover the real meaning of the New Faith, they will see that they are really parts of it by instinct and position. And for this reason, that its founda¬ tion is law, and that law is liberty. The association of law with restraint and compulsion comes from considering the word as a stat¬ ute or state enactment. But law in science does not mean a criminal code, but the line of least resistance, wherein freedom only is to be found. The foroes always follow this line of least resistance, and so the order of the world is simply the record of freedom. Law is achieved liberty, the observed order of Nature. In so far as we conform our lives to her order, we are free. When we conquer by obedience, we are emancipated from restraint. Says Goethe, —</page><page sequence="37">37 • " Only the law can to us freedom give." (Und das G,esetz nur kann uns Freiheit geben.) So it follows in the scientific faith that what is meant by law is the line or direction of growth outward into the healthy infinite life, as if you were in aspiration and life a growing part of the tree of life we have symbolized. Thus your religious life is the highest in following the laws of your social and moral being, like the foliage and flower, so healthfully and naturally that you feel it not. Then you feel that law is the absence of restraint; for its recognition trans¬ forms duty into devotion. To do our duty because we can and wish to do no otherwise, any more than the tree wishes to grow downward in¬ stead of up towards the light of the Sun, — that is the most beautiful realization of Liberty, Law, and Religion, for it is the three in one. Take, for instance, our American elm, so grand that it may stand for our symbol life-tree. How freely it lifts its head towards the sky! With what unbounded freedom and grace it plays in the breeze And yet not a branch or leaf or cell in all that glorious structure takes part in that play except under and by virtue of eternal, inevita¬ ble, inexorable law. Freedom and law are thus the same in the New Faith; for law is the order that freedom takes in executing itself. It follows, that, as religion becomes free, it becomes a part of the growth of human nature, and therefore it must follow the laws of that growth and development. It becomes at every step of its eman¬ cipation more and more a Religion of Law, and that is to become, as we have shown, whether in name or not, the universal faith, the Religion of Humanity. The relations by which man is a part of his race and the world do not cease in their intellectual perception, but the substance of Free Religion is to live them, so that they become a part of human life, as the whole tree is to its flower and fruit the sustaining life and support. The free faith is thus the monistic, as well as the integral and universal; for in it man is for the first time, by universal law, emancipated, reconciled, and united to the world in which he lives. But there is a more practical and important aspect in which you, as Free Religionists, are interested in the positive and human Faith. It is, that only through its spirit and recognition can Free Religion become affirmative, constructive, and beneficent. There can be no</page><page sequence="38">life worth living until the religious side of freedom is made visible and practical to our people. To make that revelation is one of the great duties of the Free Religious movement. To succeed you must incorporate the idea of law as the very substance of your freedom and religion, and synonymous with both. Without this you will incul¬ cate only anarchy, selfishness, and loafing, instead of true liberty, which is freedom to find our duty and do it. One touch of the sen¬ timent of law, and humanity changes our blessed freedom of soul into a constructive religious feeling, which can be satisfied with nothing but useful and productive work. Our own emancipation brings with it the greatest of obligations. Liberty is a great capital: how to invest it, after it has been acquired, is the question of the hour to the Liberal world. To you, — to this Association, as the representative of religious freedom, — many turn, with interest and anxiety, for a solution. Your answer is a matter of great moment. Upon one point all thoughtful people are agreed, — the necessity of a faith. Without that there is no mainspring to human effort, and it droops and dies. As the Poet Laureate so finely says, in his " Two Voices," — " Hadst thou not between death and birth Dissolved the riddle of earth, So were thy labor little worth." Life is naught until the questions common to all religions are answered, — Whence Whither and, What to do The decline of faith is the decline of national, moral, and social life. There must be a conviction that will call forth effort and energy, give the con¬ ception of duty, and a feeling of the worth of life beyond all power to estimate. There are but twro alternatives for you when pressed for an answer: either you must go forward, and make your new, free Faith a con¬ structive religious power, or you must counsel a return to some of the older creeds. Let us look a moment at these alternatives. A return to the Romish Church is the dream of sentimental Romanticists, but it is shown to be impossible by the law of evolu¬ tion itself. No people, even under the most cruel inquisition and wars, has ever been able to return to a faith which has lost its foun¬ dation in the total failure of its cosmogony. The Copernican system</page><page sequence="39">39 of Astronomy has rendered a return to the Middle Ages impossible. The same state of faith cannot recur unless we can return to the same environment, and that is utterly impossible. We may learn one truth from the Eden myth. When oar mythic first parents had partaken of the tree of knowledge, and left the happy state of inno¬ cent ignorance, they looked back only to see a flaming sword over the gate of their lost Paradise, forbidding all possible return. So is it ever with the steps of human progress. They cannot be taken back¬ ward. As we pass from the Faiths the Angel of Evolution now places the flaming sword in fact, if not in sight, over the gates we leave. But there is deep truth in the pictures our Romanticists give of the earnestness and the unity of the past Faiths. AVe must see those pictures in the past as admonitions of a higher and broader faith in the future. Thus to read the dreams of De Maistre, Novalis, and Comte may be of great value. Take for instance the following, from the beginning of Novalis' "Europa": — " How beautiful and blessed was it when Europe was one Christian land; when one grand interest bound together the farthest provinces of this broad spiritual realm. Without great worldly possessions, one spiritual Chief united and guided the great political powers. A numerous priestly order, to whom all had approach, stood immediately below this Chief, executed his slightest wish, and strove with zeal to confirm his power. How cheerfully might every one complete his daily task, since a safe future was secured for him by these holy men. Through them every sin or dark spot in life was washed out or purified." I have called this a dream, for it was never true as history. That there was no such unity in fact, the religious wars, persecutions, and degradation show well enough; that there could be no such unity, the creed that was not demonstrable, but enforced by faith without knowledge, was reason enough. Still stronger is that reason now when faith with and because of knowledge has become a necessity of our very life. The age of Hildebrand can never return, much less the spiritual and half civil reigns of Luther in Germany, of Calvin at Geneva, or of Knox in Scotland. Of the lesser disintegrations of the Christian creed I certainly need not speak. They are but half¬ way houses between the old and the new Faiths, and not the soul- homes of the future. They can never recur in strength, for history does not repeat itself; as to them, also, the same environment can</page><page sequence="40">40 never return. The law of progress is a constant and a higher integra tion to meet a new world and its exigencies, and thus causes a dif¬ ferentiation of the old religious beliefs, so that they can never be restored. The only safety, from the scientific point of view, is in recognizing and basing human life and society upon the new integra¬ tion or religion, which is the sum of the relations of Man to his new world or environment. The eye which catches this new and higher integration, and reveals it as our new and saving Faith, is that of the true seer, prophet, poet, and priest of our time. There is, then, no alternative for Free Religion but to perform its part in guiding our higher life towards its future. In what way it is proper for you to do that it does not become me to speak. I can only ask from you a careful consideration of the scientific, monistic, integral Faith, — the grounds of which have been purposely stated with plainness. How much you may adapt or borrow from this mode of thought and feeling, it is for you to determine. But, if you are about to take a new departure, as your worthy and beloved President announces, it seems to me a happy coincidence that has brought this subject before you on this occasion. It seems to be a matter of prac¬ tical concern. When you talk of reconstruction, upon what will you construct, and what for Where is the certainty and conviction upon which your new line of duty is to be based The faith that is based upon knowledge gives a hope for the future resting upon law, and from it the life and duty of the individual is made clearer, and cheered with the fellowship of " the choir invisible, who live again in minds made better by their presence." Time will certainly be required to render these views intelligible or satisfactory to those who " get their religion" by paroxysms of nervous excitement; but such I hope I am not addressing now. If you call this Faith to your aid, you will gradually find it grow clearer as you call upon it for assistance in your new course of duty, as leaders in the new religious life. You can have from its resources encouraging support in three most important particulars. 1. They give a solid and knowable giound for morality. The trouble with the theological morality is that it is based upon will instead of law, and is rotted to the core by the fatal doctrine of the atonement. But the morality of the new Faith is that of persistent,</page><page sequence="41">41 inevitable law. No holy sacrifice nor holy men can wash away the dark spots of life. They may be overgrown, but they remain a weak¬ ness in the heart forever. The will is but a weak dependence unless enforced by habit, and the preponderance of motives that make for the good. The will is but the creature and drift of the organism; when, for instance, the victim of intoxication calls for its aid he finds it is gone. Habit and law, and a wise prevision of motives, are the only sure guarantee of morals. Again, the new and relative Faith gives the only guide in the changes that moral customs and usages are des¬ tined to undergo in the modification and eclipse of Faiths. It is use¬ less to talk of eternal stability in morals. There is not an act that has not been moral and the reverse during some of the ever-varying phases of human society. The instinct of conscience is, indeed, an admonition, but not infallible, unless enlightened by some general view that lifts the individual above himself. This the new Faith does when it points to the good and glory of the undying Man — the uni¬ versally good and true — as the test of each act of life. Those who steer by the stars and compass need not always watch the shore, and yet are safer than those who do. 2. But next after morals, in the course of your constructive efforts, you will have to grapple with the questions of education. Here again you may find light and help from the verified Faith. Our present instruction is a singular melange of science, metaphysics, and theology. Our youth take the science at their schools, their meta¬ physics from the professors, and their theology from their mothers and clergy. That our republic has withstood this mixture for a cen¬ tury is proof enough of its inherent vigor and longevity. If " men, high-minded men, men who their duties know," are the substance of the state, the importance of the subject should lead to some effort to add to our public education the basis of moral, social, and political duty, instead of leaving it to the accident of the home or church. We must have an education that shall run its roots deep into the his¬ tory of Humanity, into the Sciences, and even our conceptions of the Infinite. What shall the future citizen know of the relations of our Republic to the world, or even of its administration, or of his duty to it, without some theory of history other than that which leaves him to believe that he is in soul, first and foremost, the subject of a foreign despot Patriotism is part of the Religion of Earth, and it rests 6</page><page sequence="42">1 42 upon some knowledge of the benefits of republican government; and that, and the consequent duties, must rest upon some theory and his¬ tory of human progress. As the rudiments of education have passed from the hands of theologians, in regard to scientific and practical affairs, so must it in those higher domains where the ideas of morality and duty are inculcated, if the future of the great republic is to be worthily upheld. Prejudices are to be avoided as far as possible, but religious edu¬ cation of the kind intimated is a state necessity; and the true com¬ mon, secular ground of the new faith is the source from whence the substance and spirit, and even may we not say the religion, of moral science, law, and politics may reach the millions to whom the destiny of our country must soon be committed. 3. I almost hesitate to say that you will find need and use for the New Faith in the extension and deepening of culture, which has been, and must ever be, one of the objects of your religious movement. Culture and free thought do indeed ray out from your Association over the whole land, and for it we are thankful. But there is room for greater breadth, warmth, and vigor, that would come from the enthusiasm of Humanity. Even the learning that is so beautifully embodied in your great neighboring University would give a deeper philosophy and more practical results under the touch of that Reli¬ gion which binds into a whole all the human past, and all of the hopes and aspirations of the future, in order to solve and consecrate our present. The fine arts and their culture are the ministering and in¬ spiring angels of the sciences and of practical life. When the old "humanities" fall with the old creeds, from whence, but from the Religion of Humanity, will they be called into play again, and be awarded duties higher, and a usefulness greater, than ever? I need not continue these illustrations. In every direction you turn, Free Religion, if it would conquer, must conjure in the name of Sci¬ ence and Humanity. In those names it cannot fail, if you dare to summon to its aid two things, the indispensable elements of all suc¬ cess and victory, — zeal and organization I This leads to the third question proposed at the outset, — In what way may the New Faith, or let me say the Free Religious Faith, in any form, be organized and cultivated on American soil</page><page sequence="43">43 Of the general need and use of organization to preserve or strengthen any social influence you are fully aware. The bundle of fragile sticks was not broken. And as we go further in civilization it becomes truer that co-operation by organization is all there is of human strength. The individual, however great or good, amounts to lit¬ tle in the great masses of society which he can singly do little to move. The individual man is less as the collective Man becomes more and more. Now, for eleven years, you have illustrated beautifully and usefully the fact that religion is a part of man's nature, independent of all accidents of creed. You have published and maintained the Declar¬ ation of the Independence of the human soul. You have done it at a transition period of our history, when in passing to a new century our country must meet new questions, a new environment in fact, which requires more than ever depth and independence of religious thought. Under the faithful guidance of your late President, whom you may not unworthily consider your Moses, you have passed out into the wilderness, so that in freedom you might become assured, by trial, of the strength of your trust in the religious nature of Man. The trial would have been no trial without sacrifices, but it is time for such trial to end. May we greet your new President as the Joshua who will really take a "new departure" towards the Prom¬ ised Land, — without, however, leaving your Moses behind to die on Pisgah. In a word, it seems to us that your wanderings in the wilderness should be brought to a close, and your hopes realized by a more effi¬ cient organization. How this may be done, if at all, is a matter for you and your officers to determine. That I should refer to it at all may seem bold. Your conventions have been heretofore made up and addressed by those who assemble as individuals, generally invited because they are persons of note and importance from their charac¬ ter and recognized achievements. I am here not for that reason, but in an anomalous position, — as one of three delegates from a Society of Humanity, incorporated as a religious society, in the city of New York. As the first delegate ever invited to address your Association, I may suggest that the fact itself intimates how easily your Convention might become the Yearly Meeting of delegations from Free Religious Societies instituted all over our land.</page><page sequence="44">44 How easily by that simple means could your Association become a powerful Religious Denomination, with untold influences for good There would be no loss of liberty, but rather a gain and assurance of it; for each of the local societies might have its own name and puiposes and perfect congregational autonomy. There would be "one of many," unity in variety, by this simple co-operation that would give to the single societies the fellowship and power of the whole Denomination. How these societies should be organized, by what name or special declarations of belief or no belief, each should deter¬ mine for itself. How the Society I represent on this occasion have done it, what they believe, and are trying to do, you may learn, if you will, from their " Epitome of the Positive Philosophy and Reli¬ gion," which I hold in my hand.* This simple effort at organization has met with fair success, and gives reason to hope that '' the day of small things'' may be the generation of great things. For what can be done by one may be done by many. Already at Brooklyn, New Haven, and other places, especially in the West, inquiries and efforts towards similar societies are on foot. There is action enough to say that the Religion of Humanity has at last taken root in America. Right here some word of explanation and justification is necessary. A few who claim to be the especial disciples of Auguste Comte seem to claim the use of the words " Positivism " and the " Religion of Humanity " as though they were private property, devised to them by their " incomparable Master." We agree with the rest of the world in thinking that the true philosophy and religion of our race is not, and cannot be, the pendant of any personality, however great; but that the personality must be regarded as a pendant or incident of the religion. A personality is a limitation, and, in separating the philosophy and religion from a strict acceptance of and adherence to * This little work may be obtained by sending address and twenty-five cents (in postage stamps) to Courtlandt Palmer, Esq., President of the Society of Humanity, No. 117 East Twenty-first Street, New York City. Particular attention is also requested to the essay of President O. B. Frothingham, on The Religion of Humanity, in the proceedings of the Free Religious Association for 1872; also to the essay of Rev. W. R. Alger, on Steps toward Religious Emancipation, in same proceedings for 1877. These essays may be obtained by addressing Rev. William J. Potter, Secretary of the Free Religious Association, Grantville, Mass.</page><page sequence="45">45 the " elaboration" and papal hierarchy of Comte, we have escaped his limitations. In America the Religion of Humanity is a republican institution, and not a Papacy; and it rests upon science and the free religious nature of man, and not upon the Ipse dixit of any master. Comte did not see that the higher integration we are entering upon is the Federal Republic of Mankind. He felt the need of a new spiritual integration, and sought to obtain it by a revival of the Papal power and unity, much as we have quoted from Novalis, sup¬ plemented by the amusing ideal and physiological Utopia of a virgin mother as the head of the family. These two institutions, the papacy and human parthenogenesis, are the corner stones — the very " eu- charist,'' as he terms the latter — of his reconstruction of society, as all who choose may see in the fourth volume of his " Positive Polity." Now, if there is anything true in Sociology, Physiology, or Evolution, both of these institutions are impossible in the future of this world. This attempt to put the new wine into old bottles was a personal limita¬ tion arising from his Roman Catholic descent, education, and environ¬ ment. If he had been " caught when young," and educated in Ger¬ many, England, or America, his disciples would never have had occa¬ sion to call upon us " to accept" such absurdities. The difficulty seems to be that few read Comte at all, and of those few the most are either prostrated hopelessly or repelled utterly. The spirit of appropriation, at least, ought to be familiar to our age and generation, and we suggest that it be applied to Comte's works without fear, — that each take what he can assimilate, and leave the rest to natural chemistry. The higher faithfulness to the true and the good, and ultimately the higher gratitude to him, requires this course. Emancipation from the old theologies would be in vain if we force our convictions towards accepting an elaboration as a whole by '' act of faith.'' The deeper study shows that Comte was mis¬ taken ; that the Roman Empire and its Christian form, the Romish Church, were the great exceptions in sociology, and not the normal order of human society; that the true order, starting in the tribal communities, has followed their convergence into representative gov¬ ernments of nations and republics, of which our own Federal Union is the type, pointing towards the United States of Europe and finally of the whole race itself, which shall inaugurate —</page><page sequence="46">46 " The parliament of Man, the federation of the World, When the common sense of most shall hold the fretful realm in awe, And the kindly Earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law." This dreSm of the Poet Laureate is the hope of the Liberal World. This Grand Republic is gradually rising to view by the " Time River," and to recognize and feel and help its growth is a joy high in proportion to our own progress. All of the enlightment, culture, and organization we have spoken of is but an anticipation in effort and heart of this great hope, and a step towards it. Our duty lies in fitting our Republic for its leading place in this Republic of the World. One hundred years ago little Boston, the cradle of liberty, had just laid the corner-stone of the American Republic. Those patriots built wiser than they knew; for that Republic has now become the corner-stone of the great hope of mankind. Shall the great Boston of to-day be oblivious of this higher duty which the advance of the years has thrown upon it Your fathers led in the contro¬ versy that gave us political liberty. You have the position, wealth, education, culture, and power that call you to lead in the long advance towards religious emancipation, and practical redemption, whereof political liberty was only the first step. Upon this Asso¬ ciation and each member of it there seems to fall a responsi¬ bility that I hardly dare to try to express; for I have come to your meeting fresh from a visit to Faneuil Hall and Bunker Hill. The Revolution succeeded only through organization: only by simi¬ lar means can the Great Republic be triumphant. We shall only advance towards it when every Liberal becomes a Minute-man, an organizing influence for the great cause, in whatever community or sphere of life he may be placed. You may say there is no pressing necessity. The good will be found by " natural selection " in time. Yes : but that process is a long one of blood and death. Our wills are the completing hands of the laws. What but knowledge and human providence can relieve the difficulties that now surround our republic, and I may say every home The questions of labor and sex, hunger and love, are two wild wants that have wolfish eyes, and the old restraints are gone or going. How can they be solved and tamed into blessings, except under the light and power of the Great Ideal That light and power must come from the reaction of the whole human race upon its parts</page><page sequence="47">47 convincing and controlling by irresistible law. To remit these ques¬ tions to the contests of selfishness alone, is to give us social war. Only by co operation and co-ordination, under the sense of right and duty, can such differences be composed; and the common relation to Humanity is the only source of right and duty that can be made a sanction to all. There is no other solution. So of every question of morals and administration. The one great need is a sense of social duty, made manifest by appeal to social law, and sustained by the power and sanction of Humanity herself. To make known these duties by education, and this sanction by culture and consecration, is certainly the highest duty of Liberals and Free Religionists in every land. This is a duty that also requires sacrifices, and perhaps other sacrifices than those heretofore made by you. Perhaps there is a kind of exclusiveness in the enjoyment of emancipation and culture which must give way in a welcome to the masses. There may be a pleasure in belonging to a select company, an aristocracy, who have by reason of their progress the possession of truth and liberty far beyond the rest of the race. But there is a higher pleasure than that, — in seeing our treasures of heart and intellect becoming the wealth of the people, and the blessing of future generations, as we by our own hands pass to them the lamp of life. Others, I know, are looking to you for strength and sympathy in this duty of our age and time. Such aid brings its compensation. The performance of the highest duty is the key to heaven in the New Faith. It secures Heaven at once, by virtue of the laws that lead thitherward. By those laws the sunshine of the future reaches down into the heart now. We need not die to find heaven: only those blind to the possibilities of earth have to do that. Eternity is here now with all its laws and influences, and a life in them can give us a motive for, and a satisfaction in, our earthly days hitherto incon¬ ceivable. Do you dream of a personal continuance beyond what is called death Do you imagine a Being that is intelligent in the laws of our nature and of our world The new faith requires knowledge beyond mere hopes or dreams or imaginations; but it denies nothing. It does assure you, however, that such hopes cannot be made worthy realities, that the approval of that Being can in no way be surely</page><page sequence="48">48 secured, but by a life of human usefulness, in the furtherance and realization of the laws that make for righteousness and the glory of Man, the Godlike, upon earth. To secure heaven there it must be also secured here. Thus, from every point of view, the highest real¬ ization of the religious nature, the highest conception of duty, of hope, and of knowledge, bring us to the Patriotism of Humanity. It calls upon us to light the lamp of sacrifice, as your fathers did, that by its light a higher use and beauty, a greater glory and joy, may be realized upon earth. The President. The audience cannot fail to accord with the full spirit of Mr. Wakeman's address. There is this significance about it: he comes here as a representative of the Church of Humanity, which has the reputation, in the vulgar mind, of being negative, destructive, and atheistic. You have heard from his own lips that it is positive, constructive, and full of the deepest and purest aspira¬ tion. You cannot but have been impressed by the profound earnest¬ ness which this new faith exerts over the hearts of all who cordially entertain it. Here is one of the workers in the new church, — a teacher and a worker together. It is because he is a worker, and be¬ cause he has the hot blood of the new faith in his veins, that he is able to speak in a way that sends a thrill through those who hoped for nothing but shadowy dreams from him. I think there is no better moment than this, after such kindling words as his, — words of en¬ couragement, words of exhortation, — to remind you of a duty that he has laid upon you of seeing that this society does not gasp and die for lack of proper support. We have a Financial Committee, who now will quietly go through the hall and solicit contributions from all those — and they must be many — who are anxious to relieve the Free Religious Association from the reproach of impectmiosity. In the meantime, we will strike another key, and a woman's hand shall touch the notes. I call upon Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith, who will read to you a poem.</page><page sequence="49">49 ADDRESS OF MRS. ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH. It occurs to me, in listening to the wonderfully fine utterances of our brothers, that we assume a little too much when we say that we are a new people ; that the Free Religious movement is a new thing. It has come down to us from the ages, in the way of episodes. The modern reformer, it seems to me, is nothing more than a late appear¬ ance of the old prophets. In the olden time all the prophets were come-outers: they came outside of the regular organizations of the people amongst whom they lived. And so the members of the liberal church are the come-outers of the modern day,— they are the proph¬ ets of our time. There is one thing to be considered in view* of this new church: Let us beware that we do not take the fiery horses and the golden chariot of the prophet and make out of them dray horses. Let us not reason too much, but let us trust somewhat to our intuitions. At any rate, we women, when we think upon these things, have to take our own individual view of them; and, if we do not reason them out upon purely scientific grounds, there is some¬ thing in a woman's soul that, while she rejects much, while she will question much, will also affirm somewhat, it may be, where our broth¬ ers reject. At any rate, it is most desirable that, as we women are coming into the front ranks, we should do our own thinking. Let our brothers be ever so cultured, ever so enlightened, ever so pro¬ found in their logic, we women must not follow them blindly; but let us do our own thinking, and reach truth in our own way, as women. I suppose that the more we go onward in the world, the more we reflect, the deeper are our questionings; and, as none but a dunce, a bigot, or a fanatic, can come to positive assertions, positive beliefs, or great spiritual ideas, it is well for us to question, question; and gradually, as the human soul enlarges, as we go on from one great thought to another, we shall individually arrive at the truth that is most essential to our own quality of mind. That is probably the only truth that is of any value to the individual. We have all learned to doubt, and we know that there is no dignity in thought, no dignity in character, only as it proceeds from the ability reverentially and wisely to doubt. I have thrown some of these questionings into the form of rhythm, because in verse we may say more with fewer words 7</page><page sequence="50">50 than we can in prose. Therefore I ask your attention to some stan¬ zas upon — Soul Questionings. — The Whence, The Why, The Where. Deep perplexed, through cloud and mist, Sometimes comes a " List! 0 list! " Heard with awe; For a silent answer blends With a vision that descends, As John saw, Musing on his island lone, Listening to the undertone, * Solemn, low, Of that never-ending quest Of the spirit's weal or rest But to know.

If, in yon eternal space, There is no eternal place, No great Where, Streaming from an unknown God, Answering with confirming nod To our prayer, Why is onward all our thought Some great purpose to be wrought In our life?. Be it weal or be it ruth, This, in all the dreams of youth, Gilds the strife. Life 0 Life forever on — Echoing ever this great moan Of the Where; Which to us is more than all Of the rosemary and gall Which we dare.

May it free Baffled thought and baffled brain From the terror and the pain ; Lift the knee Cringing, prostrate in the dust Unto gods of spleen or lust; May it hear, As the prophets heard of old, As the sibyls once foretold, — Some great seer, Wakening faith and scattering doubt, Speaking like a trumpet out To the ear. Better all the dismal woe, Out-worn dogmas learned to know, Of the lost, Than lie down no more to wake, Nor the lightning crack and break To our cost. If the rudest atom spurns To lie black in funeral urns, Silent, dim, But all matter takes a glow Like the diamond below, Sings a hymn,— Will no rhythmic crystal wrought From the element of thought Be evolved Will no bright, transfigured face Through the eons find a grace, Death absolved All the Whence and all the Why Sink to silence in the cry Of the Where Will there never, through all space, Come a voice, or come a face, To our prayer Are the shadows on the wall, And the feet that faintly fall -- On the ear,</page><page sequence="54">54 But delusions of the sense, Answering to no Where and Whence To us here Through the midnight comes a dread, — " Our beloved one is dead !" And a pall Hangs along the silent shore — Voices uttering, Nevermore! To our call. All the oracles grow dumb Where the great stone of the tomb Strikes with dread. Is there none to wrest the meaning Of this sorrowful, sad gleaning Of the dead What are schoolmen, priest, or book, When upon our dead we look There, oh, there, They in silence, deep, unbroken, Give us back nor word nor token Of the Where. Where, oh, where in unknown space Is the spirit's resting place Is our call. And the concave vault gives back Hollow echoes cold and black, And a pall. Will the silver cord be never Bound again for aye and ever, Link unbroken Strong as death, nay, strong as life, With eternal essence rife By Love's token Shall we meet ye nevermore Safe beyond the silent shore Never see, Never know, your faces dear Hearts, dear hearts, so loving here, Dead to be? O beloved thy sweet dust Must be given to my trust — Never space</page><page sequence="55">55 Thy rapt presence can enfold From this longing to behold Thy clear face. Once I saw a silvery boat Over Death's dark waters float. To the shore Pointed my beloved child, Whispering, as he went and smiled, " Evermore." And I caught a raptured gleam Of a brightness all supreme, And mine eyes Saw beyond the silent river An Almighty, great All-giver, Gleaming rise. Comprehended not, alone, Only by his shadow known, Throned afar, Mid the cold, bright,_ starry crown, Where the far-off suns are strown, Wheels the car Of the mighty God of force, — Law evolving, bond and source, Cold and dim, And no listening human ears Thrill with music of the spheres And the hymn. Did the gentle Nazarene Penetrate this great Unseen And bring nigh This Unknowable and dread Bending down a Father's head To our cry He who lowly trod our earth Taught our fatherhood of birth ; Of a care That transcends a mother's love, All a Father's zeal above, Answering Where; That his creature cannot stray, Where God's love finds not the way; All through space</page><page sequence="56">56 He will seek his loved and lost, And bring back at any cost, To his place. Shall dumb matter glow and break Into song, and beauty take, And not man Find a like sure life within, To aspiring thought akin, In a plan That, ineffable and sweet, Answers to the inward beat Which we feel Leaving no defrauded spot In the plan of good, forgot, Forth to steal? Is there no divine, undying, Sacred sonship in us lying Even here, Answering back the mighty nod Of the being we call God, Void of fear Heirs eternal by the longing To the inward soul belonging; Planted there, Sign and sequence of a right, To the ever onward light In the Where? Rhythmic matter may no more Whisper from Arcadian shore ; Mystic Pan Cease to pipe by lonely rill; Echo cease in woodland hill Love to fan ; Stars forsake the midnight sky, — And no answer to the Why Ever come; But the soul's deep, onward quest Knoweth no ignoble rest, Is not dumb: If dead matter it hath known, It from thence will find God's throne, And will bind</page><page sequence="57">57 Link to link and thought to thought, Chain, from Love's high essence wrought, Mind to mind. Oh we feel, in spite of drift, There is One athrough the rift Guides the helm, Nor permits deceitful lights, • Nor the breaker from the heights, To o'erwhelm. Sin and shame and death may be,— What are these to you or me But the woof, Out of which a life is spun, Prompting us to nobly run, Mettle proof And, if worsted in the fight, We must battle for the right, And thank God That the living sense recoils From the wounding of the foils, Feels the rod; Learns that man the ruin makes By the law he daring breaks, And life mars; Learns how high and great and true Is the way that man walks through To the stars. The President. There yet remains a little time of the morning session. Last evening we were disappointed in not having the pres¬ ence of Miss Garlin, who was to speak upon the practical work of the Association. Miss Garlin is here this morning, and will say now what she would have said then had she been present. ADDRESS OF MISS ANNA C. GARLIN. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, — I beg you will not believe that at this late hour I shall try to say all that I had hoped to say last night; but with the President's permission I will simply bring back the thought of the morning, as far as I can, to some points suggested to my mind by the very valuable talk of Mr. Wake- 8</page><page sequence="58">I man. If I make a very abrupt plunge from poetry to prose, per¬ haps it is because 1 am by nature very practical. In the paper read this morning we had a great deal of the spirit of development; a great deal in illustration of that law which binds in one common unity all diversities of life. The point suggested to my mind was that this beautiful theory, based on the law of develop¬ ment, gives us a little more trouble, in actual practice, than it would seem to do by that paper. Human fossils, the fossils of civilization, w'hat we are in the habit of calling the lower grades of development, are, unfortunately, not in a condition to be neatly strung on wires and hung up in our museums of human history. They are very much alive; so much alive that they are producing seed after their kind in our midst. Barbarism and civilization meet each other on Broadway and Washington Street; and in a government whose constitution presupposes virtue and intelligence in the governing power, but which is practically under the control of numbers, it often becomes, it must become, purely a question of arithmetic whether barbarism or civili¬ zation shall gain the day when they meet in any antagonistic en¬ counter. So far as we know, all the grades of development of the human race that ever have been are now in existence. More than that, every grade of human development must have had in its natu¬ ral stage the proper sort of environment for growth to come from, else it would not have grown to something better. Says Walter Bagshot, " The primitive need in government is not quality, but quantity." Says another great writer on political science, " When a people are sufficiently intelligent and developed to ask for fi ee govern¬ ment, then and then only are they sufficiently developed to use freedom wisely." Now, the practical point is just here : Nineteenth century, steam, travel, the telegraph, and the printing press, bring together in Ameri¬ can life, closely united in our politics, all these differing grades of de¬ velopment. For this reason the supreme problem before the American people for solution is this: How may we bridge over the chasm between centuries of natural development, by years of artificial edu¬ cation That is the problem. Now, when we are asked to take to heart the humanitarian work, it seems to me the very most important aspect of it lies in its educational tendency. Popular education is the salvation or the doom of America; we cannot trust barbarism to</page><page sequence="59">59 educate its children. We cannot trust the constitution, by merely writing "secularization, freedom, and self-development," to train this mass up into a condition in which they may grasp the faith we preach. When thirty thousand Protestants go over to Rome in one year in England, it means not simply a superficial thing; it means that thirty thousand Protestants of England are mentally or morally in a condition where they need the authoritative control of Rome. They are in a condition in which quantity, not quality, of government is their need. If to-day in America the New York " Nation " voices on the one side the cultured cynicism that says, " No more democ¬ racy, because the lower elements cannot be controlled," and if on the other side we have savage outbreaks from below, showing that the volcano is at work lively, this indicates not merely a superficial need, but a radical lack of centuries of development. Nature will not be cheated. Her path is rugged and her progress slow. If we are to succeed as a government, if the principle which in political life is identical with the principle which in religious faith we preach here, — if those two principles are to succeed, nay, if that one princi¬ ple is to succeed (for it is but one), then, as I have said, the supreme problem is, how to educate this people. Now, the problem comes to us in connection with the press: How are we to keep free speech inviolate, and yet prevent the corruption of youth by the obscenity, or thickly-veiled immorality, which makes our daily press a "Police Gazette"? The question comes again, How are we to keep inviolate the sacredness of the family relation, and yet protect innocent children from the debauchery of human life which surrounds them The question comes again in its relation to reforms : How shall personal liberty be respected and yet vice be restrained I will not take the time longer than just to state some of the problems, but I wished to bring you back to this practical point. The Free Religious Association stands, in its essential spirit, upon the sovereignity of the human soul. That means, friends of Free Religion, that we have a theory of education, of government, of labor, of religion, which says, " No authoritative control! Freedom of self-development!" Now, unless we can somehow take hold of the masses of humanity, and put into each individual life the force of self-control, anarchy will come again, and we may have to return to a more primitive condition,</page><page sequence="60">60 to an authoritative external power. I do not believe it is necessary; but I believe that to avert this danger we must work immensely harder and a great deal more wisely than we have ever worked be¬ fore. If we, the members of the Free Religious Association, think that this organization is nothing more than a Lecture Bureau, nothing more than a provision for select Sunday entertainments, if we leave Free Religion in the parlor, and neglect the kitchen and the nursery, we are at an end; we die, because we have no real work to do. I speak here to-day simply for the great cause of public education. There are other things that we are to do, but it seems to me that the primary thing is to adopt some system of aggressive work by which the people shall be made to understand the radical faith, its meaning, and its practical, broad uses; and in doing it you have to take this matter of public school education in hand and direct it aright. A com¬ pulsory school law is of no advantage unless we can secure the kind of education which will develop right citizenship. Suppose we make our constitution consistent with itself, do away with State chaplains and religious formulas, and carry into practical effect the purposes of the Libera] League, it will be for naught, unless we have developed in the masses that character, which alone makes free religion safe. It is an assumption for us to say that the religions of earlier ages were not just as good for the purposes of those times as the religion we have now is good for this time; and if the cross of Christ lifts any human soul into the heaven of self-sacrifice and moral devotion who cannot be reached by what seems to us a more cultured faith, then welcome the cross of Christ! We know and approve and stand for the free principles we have reached ; but never, never, that airy opti¬ mism that jauntily waves away the grave problems which life presses upon us. If I speak with unseemly warmth, it is because in my veins flows the hot blood of this new faith; but it seems to me that, if we are to do what we ought to do, it will take all the devotion of all the Hebrew prophets poured into our Free Religious men and women. If we are to do what we ought and need to do, we shall take up this whole land and shake it upon the question of public education, — of moral train¬ ing, of clean political life, of a rectified sense of justice, of a true fidelity in each man to his own sense of right. And the first point, it seems to me (and if I repeat, believe me, it is because I think this</page><page sequence="61">61 aspect of the question so important), the first point is to take care of public school education. The pubhc schools are the great mission stations of America. We take into our schools everything ; what do we turn out We turn out just what we might expect from a theory of education which simply takes the mind, simply takes men¬ tality out of the family relation to be trained by the State, and leaves the heart, the moral sense, the brain in its practical relations, entirely out of sight. This whole community is stirred, always is stirred, upon the subject of education, but who goes to the bottom of it Who dares tell me that the State has any right to come into a family and take out merely the brain of a child If it has a right to take the brain to be educated, it has just the same right to take the moral sense, and the hand to be trained to honorable industry. If it has not the right to take the practical ability and the moral sense, it has no right to take the brain; and surely, in this age of the world, we cannot assume that a cultured brain is any more needed for good citizenship than a hand trained to industry, that is always honorably self-supporting, and a moral sense that does not get its money by defaulting; that does not live in fear of law, but that simply, firmly and forever stands for some principle, and knows enough to have a principle to stand for. But I have talked too long. The President. There is hardly time to hear any more speeches this morning. The question that the Association proposed for discus¬ sion has been stated, and, in a certain degree, answered. Mr. Wake- man's address, purely constructive and positive in its tone, indicated, as it seems to me, very clearly the direction that earnest minds and hearts must take in formulating the processes by which we are to work out our salvation. That is to say, it is not, as the old religions put it, a question of the salvation of the individual soul, but a ques¬ tion of the salvation of the race, of the human family, of the collec¬ tive soul of man The grounds of philosophy which Mr. AVakeman stated are the only grounds that have thus far been formulated or defined which at all cover the case. It remains, however, to carry out the positions, to maintain them, to unfold them, and to project our energy into the 'future in a way to realize them. We have the schedule ; we have not yet the realization. How is that to come Very slowly. The Society of Humanity in New York is a small</page><page sequence="62">62 society, composed of a few very earnest people, who mean work. That is the only society of the Religion of Humanity, so far as I know, in this country. The radical or liberal societies stand midway between, and are more or less attenuations of the old faith, with glimpses into a great future which hovers in a dream or an imagina¬ tion, but which has not yet formulated itself in statements of the intellect. We must begin, therefore, our work at very small and few points. In the city of New York there are two societies, Felix Adler's and mine, which are radical societies, which are feeling their way towards the future; but none of us believe that we have reached ' all the details of a satisfactory solution of every problem that ap¬ pears. Consequently, whether our view be more lax, more vague, or more positive and more clear, we are all of us workers towards a result which we see from afar. There is, however, this immense satisfaction, — that everybody who works towards a result, without preconceived prejudice, seeing as well as he can the problem, and meeting it as far as he knows how to meet it in his day, is certainly making a valid contribution towards the institutions of the future time. The practical, immediate questions that come up are numer¬ ous, and they are exceedingly grave. There is no way of meeting them satisfactorily at the moment; we must look to a final solution of them gradually as we go along. The solution, however, in .my- conception, is that of a grand Religion of Humanity, based in human¬ ity, building on human needs and aspirations, and combining thus the hopes and aS| irations of men and women in a great synthesis of thought, which shall gradually and more and more draw into itself all who are really in earnest for a better time for the human race. This we can see distinctly : every one of us feels a great deal better than he thinks about these great questions. The point is to feel right. If we feel right, and are in earnest, our minds will gradually fall into line; we shall think alike, and wo shall bend our united intel¬ lect, as well as our united feeling, to bring about the great result. This is enough for a single session this morning. The afternoon session will begin at three o'clock, and the problem then will be the disintegration of the old faiths, not the integration of the new. This discussion will be in the hands of able speakers, who will do it all pos¬ sible justice. This session is now adjourned.</page><page sequence="63">63 AFTERNOON SESSION. The Association met at three o'clock, and Mr. Frotiungiiam, on calling the meeting to order, said : — The able discussion this morning was on the organization of the new faith. The subject of discussion this afternoon is the destruction of the old. The logical order would seem to be the reverse of this; the architect, when he builds, begins by preparing the ground and removing the buildings that were on the ground; and it is impossible to erect the new building until the old one is taken away. But in this instance the principle that reconstructs is going on all the time, removing and reconstructing simultaneously, so that the new goes on and the old goes off at the same time. There is never a time when the old is removed; there is never a time when the new is estab¬ lished ; but the same positive principle that builds up the new is also disintegrating the old. This afternoon, therefore, we are to have the reasons for the position taken this morning. Having stated in some measure what we mean to do, this afternoon we wish to give the rea¬ sons why we do it. Let it be understood that the Free Religious Association has no antagonism with any class of opinion, with any creed, as such, or with any institution, as such : it simply recognizes existing facts and tendencies. Looking the situation in the face, it tries to adjust itself to the circumstances of the time as they occur. Now, it seems to us, and it seems to a great many others, that the old religious system, the old ecclesiastical and dogmatic system of Christendom,.is passing away, is disorganizing, is breaking up. The signs of this we think we see in a great many forms, on all sides. We see that the reforms of the present generation are carrying on their work independently of the Church; we see that the old creeds of a hundred years ago, even of fifty years ago, are disintegrating; that people do not believe in them ; that a great many who do believe in them believe in them sentimentally and not vitally. We see an illustration of this in the " North American Review." The last two numbers of the " North American Review" contain articles repre-</page><page sequence="64">64 senting the opinions of different classes of men upon a cardinal doc¬ trine of the Church. The first one was upon the doctrine of perdition, of hell. It is a curious circumstance, that every one of the writers, with the exception of the Roman Catholic, abandons the old position. Every one of them, save the Roman Catholic, qualifies it, gets over it. The Roman Catholic was the only man of all who frankly stated his belief and stood by it, on the authority of the Church, and called upon every true Catholic to lay aside his questioning and accept the dogma of the Church. That was a symptom, a sign. There probably was not one of those men who supposed that he was conceding his whole case. Dr. Porter, who led the discussion, one of the most eminent orthodox divines in the country, probably believed fully that he accepted the doctrine ; yet it was very evident to the ordinary reader that he gave up the case entirely. This is an instance of the extent to which the old dogmas have been undermined and disintegrated, in their ancient sense, which we suppose to be their true sense. A few years ago I was at a country house in the summer, and there was a terrific thunder-storm in the night; at midnight there was a tremendous clap of thunder which brought us all to our feet. We met in the entry, and looked each other in the eye with pale faces, and wondered if the end of the world had come; because the clap of thunder followed instantaneously the flash of lightening, we thought the house must have been struck. We looked round in all the rooms, went down cellar, found nothing, and went back to bed. The next morning, we explored the neighborhood of the house, but there was nothing to be seen whatever, — no sign that any thunder-bolt had fallen on the premises; so we went on and thought no more about it. There stood on the grounds near the house a favorite tree, which the hens and chickens liked to get under, which the cattle liked to lie in the shade of, and which we all liked to look at, for it was very beautiful in form. It was always in.full leaf in the summer, and it showed every sign of strength and of complete vitality. The summer went by, and the tree showed no sign that anything had happened. In the autumn it showed the red flag a little earlier than the other trees. Still, the next season it put out its leaves again, and flourished, and looked handsome, and stood there as before; but in the very early autumn it was evident that that was the tree that had been struck. It was decayed half way down, and there were no signs of vitality</page><page sequence="65">65 above the lower boughs. The following spring it was cut down, taken away, and burned up. That is, to the eye of some of us, the condition of the prevailing instituted faiths of Christianity. It is very rich; it is very flourishing; it has innumerable churches; it ordains preachers, and carries on its sacraments the same as ever. Nobody inside of it seems aware that anything has happened. But something has happened. The spirit of the age, call it what you will, has drifted away from the Church. The shapes of reform, the definitions of faith, the way in which people put to themselves and to others their crowning idea, differ every day from the old; and if you approach men and women upon that question, they say, "Yes, yes, why, certainly, we believe this; we go to church, and listen to the sermon." But fewer and fewer people go to church, and the sleepers during the sermon are more numerous than they were. The effect of the administration of the churches on the youth, upon the working world the business world, the world of commerce, the world of politics, the world of reform, the social world, i3 gradually diminish¬ ing. That is a sign that something has happened; that is a sign that the tap-root has been struck. It may be a hundred years, it may be more than a hundred years, before the red flag is seen at the top which indicates to everybody that decay has set in; but, depend upon it, it has ; and we begin to build, not by overthrowing anything, but by taking the actual working forces of society as they exist, and say¬ ing, "Well, we must prepare against a rainy day, — the crash is coming. We shall soon be out in the cold, and we must build our¬ selves a shelter against the blast." Therefore, I say that men like Mr. Wakeman, who spoke here this morning, representing the Reli¬ gion of Humanity, are formulating a complete philosophy, laying the foundation for a new church; and in that church they expect to re¬ store and to preserve all the real sanctities that make religion fra¬ grant. He may have gone too fast and too far; at any rate, he has seen that the time is coming when the foundation may be laid solidly. We always speak with the utmost reverence of, I am sure that all the members of this Association feel the utmost respect for, everything that the old system has done in the past, giving it full credit for all its efforts at reform, for the preservation of moral habits, for the fostering of the old veneration, which nevertheless kept the world alive. We have no hesitation in granting that to the full, and probably we draw 9</page><page sequence="66">a little on our imaginations whenever we do it. I am conscious of rather overeoloring the picture; for when I read the actual history, when I have the record before me, and see and study it, I see that the facts do not come up to my fanciful dressing-up of them; and the probability is that the radicals of this present generation, the radicals who compose the Free Religious Association, do a little more than justice to the beliefs and institutions of the past, — a little more than justice, rather than less. Still we recognize the fact that those institutions are slowly passing away, and that the reverence, the faith, the conviction of the modern world, must be approached from another point. This afternoon, therefore, we undertake to show in some measure how this process is going on, and what will probably be the result of it. The discussion will be opened by Mr. W. H. Spencer, who is present and will read the opening essay. ESSAY BY WILLIAM H. SPENCER. Religion of Supernaturalism; tohy it should be disorganized, and how it may be done. " Those who think awry will scarce act straightly." — Mrs. Browning. Whether the primitive man had so far observed and classified phe¬ nomena as to grasp the idea of order, of law, of the natural, as distinguished from disorder, from miracle, and from the supernatural, may be doubted, perhaps; but there can be no question that when the idea of law first dawned upon man, it occupied but a very small corner of his universe of thought. Nature was to him a minute affair, compared with the vast super-nature that arched him with mystery and encompassed him with wonders. Why did man come to think of the realm of mystery as the home of " gods " and of smaller " spirits," good and evil What put the idea into his head that the world of the unknown is tenanted with intelligences somewhat like himself? Was it a divine revelation, or an intuition, or did departed spirits communicate it to the eye of seer, or whisper it into the ear of dreams Or shall we accept Herbert Spencer's theory of the genesis of the anthropomorphic deities, and regard them as the " other self'' (a delusion begotten chiefly of dreams), the ghosts of superior men, idealized and expanded, and through a trick of speech afterwards identified with natural forces</page><page sequence="67">67 and enthroned above ; or shall we lean to Max Miiller and his school, and look upon the primitive man as a poet, who fills his pantheon with personifications of natural objects and powers; or may it not be that both the idealizing and personifying tendencies, and still other unknown factors, are involved, I will not say in the " genesis of dei¬ ties," for that begs the question, but in the genesis of the idea of God or gods But whatever theory we adopt to explain the process by which man came to think of super-nature as the abode of super¬ natural beings, the simple fact appears to be that he so looked upon the universe from the twilight age of the race. It was natural for the primitive man to believe in the supernatural. His religion was supernaturalism. What is the core of it Is it not the worship of mystery, with fear and trembling At first man never seems to think of God in law, but in something above law. He does not look for God in nature, but in super-nature. He never sees him in the light, but always in the darkness. He peeps about, and whenever he finds a dark corner in-the universe, where mystery hides, there man stops short; his pulses quicken ; his cheeks blanche ; his mouth gapes with awe, and he whispers, " Hush what is that Look into that darkness, — the eyes of the unknown are glaring at you. It is a god, or some other supernatural being, skulk¬ ing there for a spring. That lightning is the flash of his eye, or the gleam of his deadly spear. That thunder is his ominous growl. Be¬ hold, too, from out that darkness Pestilence issues, scattering conta¬ gion from her wings. Famine, gaunt and hungry, sits there, gnaw¬ ing a fleshless bone. Now drowning floods, now scorching drought, now earthquakes and ruin, rush out of that awful cavern of mystery. What can it mean, except the gods are angry If so, they must be appeased with sacrifices of fruit and flesh, and thus arises a demand for sacerdotalism and ceremonialism. It seems to me that this terror of God as mystery and in mystery is the tap-root of all the lower forms of religion, and that even the higher religions, including Christianity, suck a good deal of sap from this ancient root. christian supernaturalism. What is the whole body of Christian theology but an awful mys¬ tery It is the Christian's " ark of the covenant," that it is sacr-i-</page><page sequence="68">lege to touch. Remember impious Uzzah of old. You must not peep between the cracks. Only " carnal-minded " infidelity itches to lift the lid. " Hands off" from this curtained Holy! Tie the bandage of "faith" about your eyes, and then you shall see it all clear as noonday. What shall you see Everything necessary to save you. In that dark corner you may see a god who so loved the world that he could not possibly forgive it for inherited sin, until he had satis¬ fied his delicate sense of justice by sacrificing to himself his own dear son, his only boy, in fact his only child. Within the same corner of mystery is secreted a Bible, more or less infallible ; a heaven, more or less select; a hell, more or less uncomfortable ; and divers shaggy terrors which it is dangerous for proud reason to lay hands on. Now, I grant that in modern Christianity there is what we may call a natu¬ ral element, viz., its ethical teaching, and its reverence for Jesus as a moral ideal and imitation of him as an exemplar, that have done very much to soften the manners and civilize the morals of Christian peoples in all ages. ' But it still remains true that in modern Chris¬ tianity the deification of mystery, and the adoration of the super¬ natural, is a very large and essential element. Do you ask, " What harm in the worship of mystery " Immense evil results from this attitude and habit of mind. In the first place, it puts religion into necessary antagonism with science. So long as Religion identifies God with mystery, just so long will she, must she, fear and hate Sci¬ ence, whose whole spirit and office is to clear up mystery, and thus dethrone the god. Science is a detective, who is going through the world and throwing the light of his lantern into every dark corner of the universe, wherever he suspects mystery is hidden. Now, if religion worships that mystery as her God, she will shun that light, and assault him who bears it as irreverent, blasphemous, godless. It has been so ; it must be so. The history of Christianity is largely a history of the struggle between science and supernatural religion. From the day the Church condemned the Copernican theory of plan¬ etary revolution, to the day when the " Monday lecturer," in the name of New England Orthodoxy, travesties the science of biology, and heaps theological odium on its noble teachers, supernaturalism in Christianity has been squarely arrayed against physical and psy¬ chical science. The spirit in Christianity which bows down before dark corners not only is, but forever must be, at sword's point with that</page><page sequence="69">69 spirit in science which throws the light of its lantern into these hiding- places of deities. The first evil, then, in Christian supernaturalism is that it necessarily antagonizes the spirit of science. The second is that it tends to beget a temper and type of mind unfavorable to perfect intellectual honesty and manly integrity. I do not propose to impeach modern, for the sins of ancient, Christianity. That were an easy task. We all know that Christian supernaturalism has been the mother of a brood of blackest curses. The worship of God, for instance, as a God of fear, and therefore as a being to be propitiated, has led to sacrifices that are sickening to read of. The doctrine of a devil is, to a considerable extent, responsible for witchcraft mania, and its hideous persecution. The dogmas of a hell and eternal pun¬ ishment therein, as Mr. Lecky has eloquently argued, spawned evils innumerable. It logically forced men to look upon a saving belief as of infinitely more importance than an upright life. It made innocent error synonymous with guilt, and declared heresy a crime of the deepest dye. It blunted the humane sympathies, calloused the moral sensibilities, made lying for Christ's sake a virtue, and exercised a terrorism over the minds of men that is appalling beyond description. These are some of the evil results that can be laid at the door of historic Christianity as a religion of supernaturalism. "But," you say, " it is not fair to fling into the face of modern Christianity the sins and follies of her youth." Grant it. But "blood will tell." If you believe in the law of heredity, then perhaps some of the vicious tendencies of ancient Christianity have descended in the veins of modern Christianity; and I should not be astonished to find some of that " bad blood" coursing in the veins of Free Religion, — a moral scrofula that may require heroic treatment to eliminate. It seems to me that modern Christianity is a " chip of the old block." While she possesses all the virtues, she possesses also many of the weaknesses of mediaeval Christianity. She is a splendid illus¬ tration of organized charity, but she has never been conspicuous for her honesty. Her heart may be full of sympathy for suffering ; she thrusts her hands deep into her pockets for alms; she goes from house to house visiting the sick, and pouring out the oil of comfort and the wine of strength, like a true Samaritan; she bends over the bedside of the dying, pillows the head on the arm of her consoling hope, and then she takes the orphan and adopts him as her own, and</page><page sequence="70">70 gives him a home, a father and a mother. All this beautiful ser¬ vice Christianity has done, and is doing. Honor to her for it! No religion can live, or deserves to live, that feels itself beneath or above this humble work. But, essential to civilization as this work of char¬ ity may be, it is not all that the age demands. Charity makes a sweet nature, but it must be supplemented by other virtues to make it a strong and well-rounded character. A man may give to the poor, like Chace and Hathaway and Waterman, and be a liar still. If we have not yet learned, we soon will learn, that charity is not enough; that the grand, granitic virtue of integrity must be put in as one of the corner-pillars of individual character, and one of the corner-pillars of our republic too, or both will topple over in ruin. It seems to me that whatever credit is due Christianity as .a teacher and exemplar of the amiable virtues, she can claim very little glory as an illustration of the manly virtues. She may well boast of her benevolence, but she ought to hang her head in shame at the mention of fairness, justice, veracity, and intellectual honesty. These virtues may indeed be found in Christianity to some extent, but they are not indigenous. They were imported from this great human heart, that has been called " totally depraved ; " from conscience, that has been denounced as a " blind leader of the blind;" from human reason, that has been stigmatized as "carnal" and "proud." Alms-giving has been at a premium ; honesty has been at a discount. Half the saints in Christendom might have failed, and paid ten cents on a dollar, without any loss to their reputation. Now, I believe that this muscular weakness, this lack of manly moral fibre in Christianity, comes down in the blood of its supernaturalism. The Church has been so long obliged to defend itself by equivocations, subterfuges, suppressions and distortions of the truth, that somewhat of the same mental habit persists to-day. Before I give illustrations of what I mean, let me speak of another evidence of bad blood. Did you ever know of a country where Christianity held the reins of government, and the Church was especially dominant, that was not intolerant The soundest orthodoxy, broadest ignorance, and most perfect Christian intolerance is a trinity more than fifteen hundred years old. The logic of Christian supernaturalism inevitably leads to persecution. It drives one to it. Convince me that I have a divine revelation in my hand, and whoever will not accept it must be doomed to eternal and</page><page sequence="71">71 excruciating torment, and I will convert that man who denies it, peaceably if I can, forcibly if I must. I will burn him in order to turn him. I will scorch his body in a short fire here, to save his soul from endless fires hereafter. I am justified in so doing. Tor- quemada and Philip II. were the legitimate offspring of Christian supernaturalism. Lecky tells us how in one age the persecutor burnt the heretic ; in another, he crushed him under penal laws; in a third, he withheld from him places of emolument and trust; in a fourth, he subjected him to the excommunication of society. In my opinion, we are not yet at the fifth stage, when perfect toleration shall be granted. It is true the heretic is not burnt, nor is he crushed by penal laws ; but he is annoyed and often cheated of justice by them. For instance, in this State a man may be arrested, as one was, and fined, for nailing up a hanging basket over his own piazza on Sun¬ day ; for planting in his garden; for doing any sort of work not strictly a work of " charity or necessity." It is true, it has come to be not only safe but quite a proper thing to ride for pleasure in car¬ riages on Sunday, but it would still shock piety to ride in a row-boat. You may pull reins but not oars. The guilt of Sunday riding has come to this fine point, — how you spell rode (rowed). One •' rode" is Christian, the other is still an infidel Sabbath-breaker. But, although not common, arrests are now sometimes made for violations of these obsolescent Sabbath laws. Again, is it quite true that places of emolument and trust are not withheld from the heretic to-day Examples of this petty sort of persecution will occur to you all. We know that this intolerant spirit does shut the mouths of many aspi¬ rants for public favors. It is rare to find a lawyer, physician, teacher, editor, or any man whose position or business success depends upon the public patronage, who has the moral courage, in a commu¬ nity of creed-bound Christians, to stand up for his religious convic¬ tions, to support them openly and defend them manfully. Few dare to do it. The Church says to them, in-a way they cannot mistake, " If, you support that preacher, I'll punish you at the polls ; I'll stop my patronage and starve you; I'll bid the whole body of Christ's Church turn the cold shoulder upon your wife and daughters, and leave them to hunt for ' society' in the back alleys.'' This is the miserable sort of persecution that the modern skeptic is subjected to in many places, even in our New England. The body is not burned,</page><page sequence="72">but conscience is ; the body is not beheaded, but honesty is ; the body is not cast into prison, but truth is; the body is not stretched on racks, but principle is, until her backbone is broken; the body is not gagged, but free speech is, in nine cases out of ten to-day, in any community of Christ-worshipers. Why, friends, I know of a city, not one hundred miles from Haverhill, Mass., where there is a literary club of gentlemen, and for thirty years no Unitarian preacher has been permitted to become a member of it, manifestly from purely sec¬ tarian exclusiveness. In the same city is an orphans' home, and one article of its constitution provides that no Universalist or Unitarian shall be eligible to office in that institution,'and another article dis¬ tinctly specifies that no child shall be adopted from thence into a Unitarian or Universalist family; and such Christian narrowness and petty intolerance may be found within an hour's ride of Boston. And yet people who call themselves liberal will sometimes tell you that " it makes no difference what a man believes." But, if Christian supernaturalism tends to intolerance, so it does to a species of dishonesty. The age of " pious frauds" has not passed away. It is true the modern church does not announce it as a distinct principle, as the fathers did, that it is justifiable and highly commendable to lie for Christ's sake, but when the " cause of Christ " seems to be opposed to the interests of truth, I have olten noticed that Christ gets the benefit of the doubt — every time. Like the sentiment of some politicians, " My country, may she ever be in the right, but, right or wrong, my country," so the church swings its hat and shouts, " My Christ, may he ever be my truth ; but,' truth or not, my Christ forever." We do not, indeed, expect to find men to-day boldly forging scrip¬ ture, as the early Christians did, but we do find them perverting its meaning in the interest of this or that sect, and shamefully violat¬ ing every rule of fair interpretation to twist it into harmony with reason and science. When such men as Prof. Dana of Yale College can say of the first chapter of Genesis, " Examining it as a geolo¬ gist, I find it to be in perfect accord with known science," we are prepared to soon hear it laid down as a dogma of the church that Joshua foreshawdowed the Copernican theory, that St. Paul taught the principles of evolution, and David was clearly a Darwinian, and</page><page sequence="73">73 St. John anticipated the phonograph, or anything else in the bill of fare — to order. Even the Monday lecturer is audacious enough to tell us that " perfect moral and religious winnowedness exists in the Bible, and in no other book in the world." " Perfect moral and religious win¬ nowedness " Why does'nt he add scientific " winnowedness," too Rev. John Jasper, of the Zion Colored Baptist Church in Richmond, Va., does add it. He proved out of the Bible on a Sunday not long ago, before his congregation, that the sun moves and the earth stands still. One of his strongest corroborative arguments was that if the earth turned round, as the astronomers said it did, the " ocean would be spilled over the land." He warned his people solemnly against the philosophers, and that he carried conviction was shown by the fact, that when at the close of the service he called on those who believed that the sun moved round the earth to hold up their right hands, every hand in the church was raised. " Moral and religious winnowedness " And at this oracular utterance, an utterance that bears the stamp of being a " self-evident, axiomatic, intuitive truth," every hand in Tremont Temple was raised. " Perfect moral and religious winnowedness''! Ask Mormonism, and it claps its hand. Ask the Spanish Inquisition, and it replies, "Yes." Ask Witch¬ craft, ask American Slavery, if " perfect moral and religious win¬ nowedness exists in the Bible, and in no other book in the world," and they will shout "Amen!" to this proposition of Joseph Cook ; but ask plain Common Sense, whose eye is not blinded by the glamour of reverence for sanctified superstitions, whose honest soul hates all sorts of " pious frauds " as it hates the Father of all lies, and it will tell you, " No, the Bible is not a winnowed book ; and if some parts of it are absorbed into the social blood, they produce dizziness of the head, spotted curses on the skin, staggering at last, and the sowing of dragons' teeth." So long as a man can stand up in Tremont Temple, a man of talent, a man of genius even, a man who has said some things admirably and many things good to listen to, — a man who upbraids Theodore Parker because he did not juggle with words and hoodwink people into the notion that there is a difference between inspiration and illumination, unnatural and supernatural, intuition and instinct, and make distinctions where there is no difference, — when 10</page><page sequence="74">74 a man can thus play hocus-pocus with his words to shield orthodoxy from the manly blows of Parker, the day of " pious frauds" has not passed away. People do still conceal and pervert the truth to save their scripture. It is a habit of mind, a moral leprosy that this generation has inherited with its theology. There are many signs of this bad blood in our religious body. Here is one: when the American Bible Society, after seven years' trial, withdrew their re¬ vised edition of the Bible, one of the Board told Dr. James Free¬ man Clarke that they did so because, " if they began making cor¬ rections in the Bible, the people would lose faith in it altogether." And so it appears they dare not winnow the Bible of error for fear of winnowing their brains of it. See, too, the sort of tricks resorted to to build up the Church. The Fathers of the sixteenth century used to seduce people into the Church by pulling their nails out; slitting their tongues; carving their ears off; toasting their feet brown oyer a slow fire; starving them -in dungeons : stretching them on racks; flaying them alive, and by other similar persuasive arguments. The modern Church has abandoned this sort of logic. As we used to go out into the field when boys to catch some liberty-loving " infidel" colt, with a measure of oats in one hand and a halter in the other, held behind the back, so the modern preacher usually goes out to rope in converts. He walks quietly into the house, and holds out his measure of sweet words, and calls softly, " Come, please come, join our Church, — it will make us all so happy." But the creature whose home has been the green pastures of free thought catches a glimpse of the halter, and sidles off,— "I think not sir. I don't believe as you do. I don't know exactly what I do believe, but I know I don't believe in the trinity-article, pr in the eternal-punishment article in your creed." " Oh, well, never mind, never mind," says the fellow with the halter, "it isn't necessary that you should believe all, — at least at first; many in our church do not of course believe everything in the creed, we can't expect it; we let each one make his own interpretation, you know; we are liberal — very liberal. Do not let any little doubts of that sort trouble you. Come, please be one of us. It will help you socially. Christ calls you —' his yoke is easy and his burden is light' — come, sister, come." And in three weeks, perhaps, she meekly puts her neck into that halter of thirty-nine linked articles,</page><page sequence="75">75 when in the bottom of her soul she knows that she only believes nine out of that thirty-nine. I call such priestly practices nothing more nor less than ecclesias¬ tical " roping-in," worthy of tri-card-monte men or a bunco fraternity; a true lineal descendent of the spirit that once forged decretals, man¬ ufactured holy relics, invented miracles, multiplied lies, and openly adopted the practice of " pious frauds " as a principle. It is Jesuit¬ ism in the mask of piety, but a mask so thin that you can see Death's head behind it. The mirror of fashionable Christianity is tacked on to its own coffin-lid. I do not know that you may agree with me, but I believe that this dry-rot of insincerity in religion is eating at the heart of integ¬ rity ; I believe that frauds in religion are some blood-relation to frauds in trade. Bankruptcy of religious sincerity is in partnership with bankruptcy of business honesty. " What church did he belong to of what Sunday school was he superindendent " is a pertinent question in these days when a man swindles his creditors out of a hun¬ dred thousand or so. Show me a man who professes a creed which he doesn't believe, and I will show you a man of flabby fibre, a man whose character is like a good many of our Haverhill shoes, shoddy at the inner sole (soul). Between these counterfeiters in faith and these counterfeiters in coin there is but* one moral downward step. Sincerity in religion, or sincerity without it, if we cannot have it with religion, is what we want. In my opinion we will never get it until we get rid of this supernaturalism that can only defend itself at the sacrifice of truth. How many modern Christians are like the old deacon who used to cheat his neighbors in a trade, and then kneel down by a stone-wall and pray that if he had done anything wrong a stone might fall on him. He satisfied his conscience by the flimsy assertion that he must be all right, because not a stone had ever moved from its place. One day, however, after the usual prayer, a loose top-stone did fall. He jumped to his feet in great terror, and cried out, " Good gracious, Lord didn't you know I was joking " That's it; our fashionable piety, that kneels before its stone-wall mummery, is "joking." How can we manage to push that stone-wall over and shut the mouth of hypocrisy and cant That brings us to the second ques¬ tion, —</page><page sequence="76">76 HOW TO DISORGANIZE THIS SUPERNATURAL RELIGION. I have given so much time to the tvhy it should be disorganized, that I cannot give the space which the importance of the subject merits to the how to disorganize it. Supernatural religion! There are plenty of people who will tell you, to "let it alone." Indeed! I remember that Slavery said, " All that we want is to be let alone." But I remember that Liberty replied, " We will not let you alone; we will smite you hip and thigh ;" and she did it. " Oh, but," says a sort of lazy, lounging, sentimental liberalism, " evolution will disorganize and reorganize religion;" and, yawning, it goes off to bed, to let "evolution" or some other abstraction run the universe. Such people talk as though the south winds were wooing men out of their superstitions; as though the stars were nightly arguing on the side of truth; as though there were an invisible "spirit of the age" floating around loose, somewhere overhead, that would win the battle of liberty and light for us. Away with such debilitating nonsense! The age needs a tonic, not an opiate. Of course, there is in evolution an external factor independent of man, but there are also internal factors, and man is one of them, that must co-operate with J;he external or stagnation and death will follow. Do you tell me that— " Through the ages one increasing purpose runs, And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns " No doubt of it. But what widens them Not the " process of the suns," by any means. Sun-heat may hatch eggs, but sun-heat poured down on the cranium of Africa for thousands of years and never hatched one respectable idea south of the equator. The " pro¬ cess of the suns" doesn't care a fig for truth: it is just as con¬ tented with the religion of a Bushman as of a Bostonian. There is no power in the winds, water, earth, air or sky that is contending for light against darkness, truth against error, naturalism against super¬ naturalism. The only power that ever did or ever will banish error from the mind of any man lies in the truth, which is very likely in the mind of some other man coming in and taking possession, — and the only way that I know of by which truth can get a chance to</page><page sequence="77">77 grapple with error is to bring them face to face, either by the written or spoken word. Truth may be our general, but we must be her soldiers. She merely points the way; we must march in it. She is dumb; we must speak for her. She sits there in the heat of battle, at the head of the column, but with an " empty sleeve ;" we must strike for her. She is weak with the loss of blood from the spear stabs of error ; we must fight for her: — " Many loved truth, and lavished life's best oil, Amid the dusk of books to find her; Many in sad faith sought for her, Many with crossed hands sighed for her; But these, our brothers, fought for her, At life's dear peril wrought for her, So loved her that they died for her." So sings the poet of our patriot dead, whose memory a nation yesterday wreathed with flowers. As they struggled for truth in state, we must struggle for it in religion. I have no patience with this dead-head, do-nothing liberalism, that in the midst of the smoke and battle-din skulks to the rear among the ambulances and rubs its hands complacently, and blesses God that " evolution is driving every¬ thing before it; truth is mighty and will prevail; the spirit of the age is marshaling her battalions on the sky to flank the enemy and bag him. Let us drink to the health of the glorious nineteenth century." Shame on such men! I never hear such a fellow talk but I wish I could put him back into the sixteenth century amid the thumb-screws, gags and fagots, and make him feel what liberty is worth by realizing what it has cost. Evolution will win only when it is incarnate in men who will think for her; truth will triumph only when she is incarnate in men who will speak for her; the spirit of the age is powerful only because she is incarnate in a brave army of individual men who are willing to do and dare and struggle for truth as for their God. The sooner we radi¬ cals get rid of this philosophical superstition that the rotation of the earth will some way reform the world, or that any other abstraction will save us and ennoble the race, the better it will be for us. First, then, in order to disorganize supernaturalism you must think, speak, toil for it. How This brings us to the question of method. What</page><page sequence="78">78 is it that has been disorganizing Christian supernaturalism Speak¬ ing generally, we say Science has done it. Wherever she throws the beams of her lantern into the dark corners of earth or sky, superstition flies away, like night-owls before the morning light. The idea of law has banished the idea of lawlessness in nature. Order sits on the throne of the heavens. The natural is seen to be so high that there is .no room on the top for supernatural. The sky-lights of the temple of nature open out beyond the Pleiades, and give us glimpses of a vast beyond. In that upper blue lie continents of truth wThich no intellectual Columbus has caught sight of. There, imagination can still sweep her wing, and poetry dip her pen. Yet, where we cannot see, we have reason to believe that law is " Lord of all." So far as we can follow, we can hear that eternal voice calling us, and as it passes through the curtains of the known we still can hear the sweet echo of its song. Need I specify how the different sciences have chased super¬ naturalism out of religion How diseases which once were regarded as possession of devils are now cast out by therapeutics, without the mediatorial assistance of a " herd of swine " We say to small-pox, " Come on, I've muzzled danger with vaccinia; " to pain, " Give me morphia and I'm a match for you;" to the thunder-bolts of Jupiter, " Oh, I know you. Come down out of the clouds! Here, run along this wire and carry my message, will you?" "Your obedient ser¬ vant," answers the lightening ; " have nothing else to do — am loafing this afternoon; will carry it for nothing, and in no time," — and swifter than Mercury he flies, and before we can think, he is there. No wonder men were terrified at earthquakes when they thought that God in his wrath had seized the poles of the earth and was try¬ ing to shake man's impiety out of him. But when science tells us that such shakes are only a deep breath which mother earth is draw¬ ing as she sinks into a deeper sleep, we let her shake, and ourselves drop to sleep. When men looked upon this little marble of earth as the pivot on which the universe hinges, the centre of all creation, it was com¬ paratively easy to think that the priests had a monopoly of God's ear, and that Calvin's theology was a transcript of God's ground- plan of the universe. But when people found that this little speck of a world was insignificant in comparison with the countless uni-</page><page sequence="79">79 verses that wheel on in their stupendous orbits, then men began to think that perhaps the Creator was too busy to watch little boys who go fishing on Sunday and to run around on errands for those who send up petitions for rain or sunshine. The revolution in astronomy is slowly revolutionizing theology. The public school is the best radical preacher. This nineteenth century man is a kind of universal Yankee. He can invent miracles and explain them. Is he afraid of any Noahian deluge Not at all. He can build an ark warranted to stand any flood. He catches the fickle winds and ties them to a sail, and flies around the world. Fire and water he yokes together, and harnesses the span to palace-cars and palace-ships. He eclipses eclipses; long has he whispered through an iron wire, but now he sings through one; and his latest miracle (unless one came out in the morning paper) is the phonograph. He talks into a box ; makes, perhaps, his " last will and testament." His voice is mysteriously locked within, — and when he is gone a friend turns a crank, and the dead man's voice repeats the words, " I give and bequeath all my personal property, &amp;c, &amp;c, to my beloved wife," —and the second husband, standing by, wonders whose wife his wife is, any way, and whether she has ever been divorced from that box with a crank on it. And so modern science raises Lazarus after he has been in his grave ten times " four days." It discredits the ancient miracles by working greater, yet does it all in the name of law. And thus, in one way or another, science is illuminating the dark and haunted realms of the supernatural; unveiling mystery and showing the most hidden and miraculous phenomena to be in har¬ mony with universal law. The supernatural is seen to be only an upper story of the natural. There are no "vacant rooms" up stairs. Law occupies them all. Do you say there is mystery still? Cer¬ tainly The deper we go, the deeper the mystery; the higher we climb up the mountains of the known, the farther the vast heavens of the unknown seem to stretch out before us. " Higher than our arrows fly Deeper than our plummets fall, Is the deepest, the most High, Is the all in all."</page><page sequence="80">80 Does it seem to you that the idea of law banishes God from the uni¬ verse Then get a higher idea of the Highest. Do many troubled souls, like Mary Magdalene, wander about the grave of their beloved, crying, " They have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him " Oh, no, dear soul, natural religion does not take away your true "Lord," but reveals him. It does indeed take away Lord Jesus or Lord Gotama, but it gives you a higher than these. It tells you that you need not travel away off to Nazareth or Kapila- vastu to find your Lord and master, for here he is close beside you, — in your own annointed self; in the "Christ," the Buddha, the Best in your own soul; in the pure Ideal uneclipsed by any human personality. The essence of religion is the worship of the Ideal. The fiction in religion is that the Ideal was embodied in some historic character. What does naturalism lose by getting rid of this illu¬ sion The Jesus of history might fade from the memory of men, but our religion is engraved on the forehead of All Time, and abides for¬ ever. You might slash the knife of historic criticism into the Gospels and let out every drop of the blood of the historic Jesus, and leave naught but a ghastly skeleton, bleaching on the sands of tradition, and our religion is not touched thereby. Our Ideal rises on wings above all the accidents of history; above the graves of sweet illusion ; rises like a deathless radiant angel, — like — " Sandalphon, the Angel of Glory, Sandalphon, the Angel of Prayer." " Wait there, — wait and invite me while I climb ; For see, I come — but slow, but slow Yet ever as your chime, Soft and sublime, Lifts at my feet, they move, they go, Up the great Stair of Time." The President. Now I have the special pleasure of introducing to you a lady from New York, who is well known throughout the community as a speaker, and who came on for the purpose of attend¬ ing this convention, — Mrs. Clara Neymann.</page><page sequence="81">81 ADDRESS OF MRS. CLARA NEYMANN. [It is regretted that, by a misunderstanding, we have no better report of Mrs. Neymann's Address than the following very incomplete one taken from one of the Boston daily papers.] Mrs. Neymann said she rejoiced in every liberal convention and gathering, because it showed the world that liberals were no longer in the background, but were up and doing. She mentioned as rea¬ sons why more women were not connected with the free religious movement, that in the past their education, especially in the classics, which broadened the range of thought, had been neglected; that they had received much recognition in the Church; that the most intelligent women were engaged in another direction in obtaining the political and other rights of the sex. In this connection she re¬ marked that independence and freedom in religion and independent citizenship for women were intimately related to each other. An¬ other reason why more women were not connected with the move¬ ment was because they were afraid of injuring their own peculiar cause. Mrs. Neymann then spoke for this peculiar cause, making a forcible woman suffrage address. She afterwards spoke strongly for a greater morality, a larger spirit of self-sacrifice, and a pro- founder recognition of the rights of others in the world. The old creed had been, love of God and obedience to his will; the new one was, love to man and obedience to the laws of Nature. A deep, reverent love of man for humanity must take the place of the love and reverence which had been given to God in the past. The esteem and honor in which his name had been held must be given to man, and the sacrifices of the future laid down on the altar of humanity. The speaker entered into an elaborate argument to show that man was indebted to humanity and his fellow-men for the best things he had, and that his success depended largely on the assistance and co-operation of others. He could never pay back to humanity but a very slight portion of that which he had received. Life for others, therefore, was a constant duty, — the logical consequence of the fact that he lived by others. She also made an earnest plea for a higher, broader, and more natural education, beginning with the children, as a necessary condition of promoting freedom in thought and religion. 11</page><page sequence="82">1 82 The President. There yet remains half an hour of the after¬ noon session. I call on Mr. Maurice Ellinger, editor of "The Jewish Times," who has come all the way from New York for the purpose, now to address you. ADDRESS OF MAURICE ELLINGER. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, — I fear that the grace¬ ful speaker who has preceded me has entertained 3'ou so well, and has given you such an amount of solid food, that the task before me is indeed very difficult, and I certainly shall not detain you very long. The questions that have been discussed during the day are, How is the Religion of Humanity to be organized and, on the other hand, How is the religion of supernaturalism to be disorganized the questions of organization and disorganization, which certainly go hand in hand. It seems to me that there are two events that have occurred this week that illustrate the fact of organization and disor¬ ganization, both pointing, however, to the establishment of the Reli gion of Humanity. The one event is the celebration in France, on yesterday, of the birthday of one of the greatest disorganizes of the religion of supernaturalism, — Voltaire. This is an event which interests humanity at large. It is a demonstration of the power of one single mind, which did nothing else but disorganize. He hurled the shafts of his satire against the mountains of superstition under which society groaned even more than it does to-day, because super¬ stition and supernaturalism were better organized and had greater power and control than they have to-day; yet this single mind, with its shafts of irony and satire, made such a breach in the religion of supernaturalism that France became, as it were, a nation of Rational¬ ists. It opened the way for a school of Rationalism. And what does that mean It means that it set a number of men, not only thinkers by profession, but all those who had the faculty of reading, and who looked upon thinking as an occupation worthy of every man, whatever situation in life he might occupy, — it set these men all thinking; and there was no work of disintegration or disorganization to be done, because superstition and supernaturalism disappeared from the minds, I may say, of hundreds of thousands of people. Thought had done the needed work.</page><page sequence="83">83 The other event to which I have referred, and which illustrates, perhaps, the principle of organization, is the gift of seventy thousand do lars by the member of a church for the purpose of relieving that church from its indebtedness. It illustrates the devotion of which one man is capable, if he possesses enthusiasm; and enthusiasm is necessary to accomplish any work, and certainly if such a high work as the work of humanity is at stake. That man gave this large sum, this princely sum, upon one condition, namely,—that the church which he relieved from its indebtedness should open its doors to all alike; that no more seats should be rented; that any one who desired to enter that church, and there receive the consolation of the reli¬ gion that is preached from that pulpit, should receive it without pay¬ ing for it. In other words, his intention certainly was to benefit humanity, and to help in organizing the Religion of Humanity. So you see there are two different ways of organizing and disor¬ ganizing religion; and, in fact, this business of organizing and dis¬ organizing has been going on for several thousands of years, — as long, indeed, as we have a record of humanity. As long ago as his¬ tory shows us what humanity did, humanity was doing little else than organizing and disorganizing its religion. Let us go back to a period which is known to most people, to believers and disbelievers,— to the period when Moses, as history tells us, gave the law to the Jews. What else was he doing but organizing the Religion of Humanity It appears that at that time people were so laboring under that power of superstition so eloquently painted and pictured by Mr. Spencer, that they were obliged, as they conceived, to appease the Deity by human sacrifices. Our friend Moses, it appears, told them, " You must no longer offer human sacrifices: animal sacrifices will do." And thus he laid the foundation — he laid at least one stone in the foundation — of the Religion of Humanity, which has finally culmi¬ nated in this Free Religious Association. Afterwards some prophets came, with the same disposition, and they said, " Animal sacrifices are no longer necessary;" and finally a man came, Jesus of Naza¬ reth, and he did not apply himself to the rich and the aristocratic, but he applied himself to the humble and the lowly, to those who were troubled in spirit, in mind, and in body. He came to them, and he tried to give them a religion by which they would be lifted up, by which they could become the world's ministers, by which they</page><page sequence="84">84 could become fit members of humanity. He certainly did endeavor to make some advance in the Religion of Humanity, though what we see to-day as organized Christianity is not the Christianity of Jesus of Nazareth. He certainly meant a great deal better than the peo¬ ple are doing to-day. But it is the organized Church that is disor¬ ganizing Christianity, and it is against disorganized Christianity and disorganizing dogmatism that we have to battle, not against the reli- gion of history and humanity, which I believe is the basis of that religion which Jesus of Nazareth taught. And even in this Chris¬ tianity — which has a history, not as old as the religion of Judaism, but certainly older than any other of the modern religions — we also find some warriors who did battle for the Religion of Humanity. Luther is one of them. While he left a great deal of the old for¬ tress of superstition standing, no one will deny, certainly in this audi¬ ence, that he did battle as a very brave warrior to break down a great many of the walls which the Church of Rome had built up,— a fortress which was not Christianity, but was Rome, pure and proper. And there were others who did work of that kind in the service of the Religion of Humanity. There is Giordano Bruno, — a very val¬ iant warrior. Even Calvin, who is berated so much, — what a sys¬ tem he organized in opposition to Rome, because he no longer thought that the Church of Rome was the Religion of Humanity? And he endeavored to teach men a new religion, which he thought might be able to bring the human family into one fold. Of course he was a son of his time, as much as we are sons of our time; and I do not think, I do not believe, that we shall be able to bring the whole of the human race into one fold, but that we shall go on and do out¬ work as they did their work, and perhaps, after hundreds of years, a religion will come under which the great majority of the human family can live together in peace. There is one thing, however, we can do to bring about that era. I do not believe that I can convince my friend Wakeman that the system which he advances is not exactly a system upon which we can all agree, nor will my friend Wakeman convince me that it is ; but there is one thing of which I desire to convince every one. I want to convince the priests and the bishops in the Catholic Church ; I want, if possible, to convince the Presbyterian preacher who insists upon his peculiar dogma; I want to convince even the preacher on</page><page sequence="85">85 the platform of liberalism, of Free Religionism, — that the Religion of Humanity can be built up only upon one platform, and that plat¬ form is that of the largest toleration and freedom of o^mon. If we shall be enabled to bring people together to discuss questions of reli¬ gion, — not of dogma, for a dogma cannot be discussed, because it is not founded in reason or upon reason, but upon authority, — but to discuss questions of religion, and to freely exchange their views, and advance the reasons why they hold one opinion or the other, we have laid a platform for a religion upon which humanity can stand. I believe that Free Religionism can do that, and that is the first thing that is necessary to be done, and perhaps the only thing pos¬ sible to this organization, — because, if we say we want to build this organization as an organization by itself, we see that, although the expenses are very trifling, it takes great labor and difficulty, as we have heard stated to-day, to collect money for these trifling expenses; and I am afraid we should never succeed in collecting the funds necessary to organize the Religion of Humanity, that can do all the great things we have been told to-day we must do. For instance, as the speaker who preceded me said, very wisely, we must advance education ; we must establish schools,—not only Kindergartens, but schools in which grown persons may be able to learn something, and, above all, learn to divest themselves of supernaturalism, and become scholars, adepts, in the faith in which we believe. All these things require a great deal of money, and I am afraid that the numbers who have enrolled themselves in our list are not sufficient to do a great deal of this work yet. I have mentioned one man, a member of one church, who has given to that church seventy thousand dollars ; and there are all over the country colleges founded mostly by men belonging to certain churches, that uphold certain creeds ; and yet I believe all these men were certainly doing the work of humanity, because, if I am not misinformed, I believe that even in those sec¬ tarian colleges and institutions men stand up promulgating the doc¬ trines of science. They are not afraid to proclaim those doctrines, no matter whether they clash with the views of certain religionists or not. But those scientific truths are taught there, and as long as scientific truths are taught I believe that the Religion of Humanity is advanced, because I believe that theological error is thus rooted out more quickly then by directly attacking it. Men are in the habit of</page><page sequence="86">86 clinging to a truth or a falsehood much more tenaciously when you attempt to root it up by force than if you gradually teach them that they are wrong, or teach them a truth by which they become con¬ vinced themselves that they are wrong. I believe we ourselves have not been converted by having people come to us and tell us that what we have believed until now was wrong, or was in accordance or not in accordance with nature. We have been gradually learning some thing better; we have been going to the school of science, some of us ; some of us have been going to the school of philosophy ; others have been going to the school of history, — and all at once the truth has dawned upon us that supernaturalism cannot stand and become reconciled with reason, with truth, and we have to look out for some¬ thing else that can stand. And that is the way in which I want the Religion of Humanity to be organized and established, namely, by bringing that information to the average intellect that it will open of itself and come to the con¬ viction that humanity needs nothing beyond nature and nothing above nature ; that nature is all that humanity requires ; that humanity has been standing upon the platform of nature ever since it came to the conviction that humanity is something higher than animal life. Ever since the day dawned that the human intellect inquired, " Where did I come from where do I go to " ever since the day that the hu¬ man intellect laid down the problem, that with the animal existence, the earthly existence, everything does not end, but that our existence is born into an immortal existence, — ever since that day, I say, hu¬ manity has stood upon a platform which will be gradually enlarged and elevated, and upon which all may finally stand. Now, there is one thing very remarkable, — that one of the grand¬ est and most far-sighted statesmen of this age, a man who had the capacity not only of foreseeing certain events in the future, but of foretelling them with a precision which looks somewhat as if he had been gifted with what in former ages was called prophecy, should have predicted religious events which some of us may live to see fulfilled, — I refer to Count Cavour, who foretold certain historical events long before they occured, and who expressed to a friend of his, in an interview held a year or two before his death, that he regretted that he should not be able to live through this century, for the reason that he foresaw that with the end of this century there would arise</page><page sequence="87">87 the birth of a new religion, and he believed that its birth would be accompanied by a revolution such as the world had never seen before. He believed, also, that this new religion would be so firmly rooted as to embrace within its fold the largest portion of humanity. " This religion," he said, " will not be born of materialism, which denies all idealism in the world, which denies the existence of every¬ thing outside of matter. This religion will not be the offspring of Nihilism, nor will it be the offspring of those religious that have governed the world thus far, but it will be a religion born of rea¬ son, and resting in faith upon that truth on which humanity instinc¬ tively and unconsciously has felt, ever since existence began, that it could rest. It will see a God that the world will confess cannot be described, cannot be pictured, cannot be pointed out, but a God which every human being will feel within him to exist, and upon which, he will feel safe to rest his future, and rest safely." He believed this, and I also share that faith and belief. It is only in modern times that such an idea as the Religion of Humanity is possible. The human race was divided into too many sections in former years. They were secluded within themselves. The different portions of humanity did not know each other as they do in these days. The electric spark did not then communicate the ideas that arose in the far East, with the quickness of lightning, to the far West. Humanity was not in that instant and fraternal com¬ munication in which it is to-day ; and only as men approach nearer and nearer to each other is it possible that we shall have a religion of humanity; because the more we see of each other, the more we know of each other, we know that, in order to be religious, it is not necessary that we be enclosed in a church. It is not necessary to say that Jews and Christians must be divided because their ancestors were divided. Men see each other nowadays as they are, in the family, in public life, in society, and the more they learn of each other, the more they will find out that supernaturalism, that teaches that men shall speak in the name of God, and declare certain truth in the name of God, is a fallacy. Only a religion born of our senti¬ ments, our instincts, our reason, our better knowledge of each other, — only such a religion will be the religion of the future, — a religion that will take hold of us because we feel it in ourselves; because it is a religion that draws humanity nearer and nearer together, that does</page><page sequence="88">not build a barrier between brother and brother, nor between differ¬ ent nationalities, creeds, or colors. It is, therefore, the platform of the Free Religious Association, where the Jew and the Christian, the Presbyterian and the Episcopalian, the Unitarian and the Trinitarian, the Atheist and the Materialist can stand, and listen with the same respect one to the other; where the reformer can appear, who per¬ haps is denied an appearance upon any other rostrum ; where every form of thought can appear in free exchange. It is this platform which will bring the Religion of Humanity near to us, and this free interchange of thought is the only available means by which the Religion of Humanity can be organized. The President. The discussions of the day are now closed. There will be a social meeting this evening at Horticultural Hall, not for the discussion of questions, but chiefly for the exchange of friendly feelings. There is one point which I wish might have been touched upon to-day, and somewhat elaborated, which seems to me quite important for the practical organization of the Free Religious idea, and that is, some means by which there should be established a communication, an affiliation, a fraternity, between different Free Religious societies in different parts of the country. Our friend Mr. Wakeman spoke this morning with great earnestness and force, and I think great judgment, upon the necessity of planting associations upon this idea wherever any members can group themselves together. Then what is wanted is an exchange of sympathy, in some general convention of these different bodies specially represented, which should compare notes together, and should weave a web of mutual affiliation and sympathy by which they could cover large areas of country. In that way we should best keep alive and keep vigorous a public sentiment composed of the members of Free Religious asso¬ ciations, and carrying wherever these centres were formed the power of the whole united body over the country. The effect of such a movement as that, I am convinced, would be very great indeed, and it would be worth while in some future convention of the Association to discuss the ways and means that should lead to it; but the hour is too late, and the discussion cannot be entered into now. Fortu¬ nately, there will be other conventions. It is possible that this even¬ ing there may be speeches at Horticultural Hall from Mr. Calthrop</page><page sequence="89">89 (whom we were hoping to hear this afternoon) and others upon these topics. Let us hope there may be, and let us hope that the spirit of those speeches will be as wise, excellent, and cordial as the speeches have been all through the day. This convention is now adjourned. SOCIAL FESTIVAL. In the evening members and friends of the Association gathered in good numbers, in Horticultural Hall, for the social part of the. Annual Meeting. In view of the condition of the treasury, the Executive Committee had decided that it would not be wise to incur any expense this year for decorations, music, or for providing refreshments. Nor was there much speaking from the platform. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable occasion, giving opportunity for friendly greeting and for cementing the bonds of social acquaint¬ ance and fellowship. Quite a sum was received at the donation tables for the treasury, though not so much as was hoped for. May we not expect that the needs of the treasury will be still remembered by friends who were not present 12</page><page sequence="90">CONSTITUTION OF THE FREE RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATION. I. This Organization shall be called the Free Religious Association,—its objects being to promote the practical interests of pure religion, to increase fellowship in the spirit, and to encourage the scientific study of man's reli¬ gious nature and history; and to this end all persons interested in these objects are cordially invited to its membership. II. Membership in this Association shall leave each individual responsi¬ ble for his own opinions alone, and affect in no degree his relations to other associations; and nothing in the name or Constitution of the Association shall ever be construed as limiting membership by any test of speculative opinion or belief, — or as defining the position of the Association, col¬ lectively considered, with reference to any such opinion or belief,—or as interfering in any other way with that absolute freedom of thought and ex pression which is the natural right of every rational being. Any person desiring to co-operate with the Association shall be considered a member, with full right to speak in its meetings; but an annual contribution of one dollar shall be necessary to give a title to vote, — provided, also, that those thus entitled may at any time confer the privilege of voting upon the whole assembly, on questions not pertaining to the management of business. III. The officers of the Association shall be a President, twelve Vice- Presidents, a Secretary and Assistant Secretary, a Treasurer, and not less than six nor more than ten Directors; who together shall constitute an Executive Committee, intrusted with all the business and interests of the Association in the interim of its meetings.

Five members of the Executive Committee shall consti¬ tute a quorum. IV. The Annual Meeting of the Association shall be held in the city of Boston, on Thursday, of what is known as "Anniversary Week," at such place, and with such sessions, as the Executive Committee may appoint; of which at least one month's previous notice shall be publicly given.
