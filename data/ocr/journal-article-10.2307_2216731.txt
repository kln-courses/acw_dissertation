Price $3.50). Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, was a man of brilliant parts; a leader of fashion, a masterful though rash statesman, the foremost orator of his time and a pertinacious writer on history and philosophy. His reputation was blackened in the eighteenth century, and later authorities have slighted his philosophical opinions. It was the posthumous writings on the dogmas of religion that chiefly provoked scandal; he was felt to have outdone all the free-thinkers by the scathing style of his attacks. Leland, in his View of the Principal Deistical Writers gave more space to Bolingbroke than to all the other deists put together. The author of the present book is inclined to think that he was the most comprehensive and philosophical of the line. Mr. Merrill has produced a methodical collection of Bolingroke's theological discussions and care- fully compared them with those of earlier deists. The opinions of his subject are com- piled in the ponderous manner of the university thesis; but the labour is performed with exceptional thoroughness. The author patiently pursues the sources of Boling- broke's ideas, and gives references for all his citations. He has explored the literature and affiliations of deism widely and in detail. He finds in the Works a number of doctrines that move beyond the positions of Collins, Tindal, Morgan, and Chubb. The main assumption of the Letters to Pope and the Fragments is similar to the outlook of the earlier deists. God fashioned the world at a remote point of time and allows it to proceed in accordance with the general laws of nature. Bolingbroke, however, rejects, more positively than other free-thinkers of the period, a belief in the interventions of particular Providence; accordingly he re- jects miracles. The conception that rules his theology is that which governs much of speculation in the eighteenth century, the idea that the universe has been perfectly planned and that everything has been placed in it by divine intention. He draws, however, several unusual consequences from these directive ideas. He refuses to accept the lofty position in the chain of being which the theologians ascribe to man. Man is an insignificant creature closely related to the irrational animals and the inert vegetables. It is sheer presumption on the part of the theologians to imagine that the world was created for his benefit. A further consequence of the optimistic theory in Bolingbroke's thought is more serious for orthodoxy. He places all the weight on God's wisdom and foreknowledge, almost to the exclusion of His moral attributes. In his polemic with the theologians he constantly protests at their anthropomorphic conceptions of the Deity; and he derides the traditional notions on the ground that they apply human ideas of goodness and justice to God. Bolingbroke's own 'natural attributes,' the infinite wisdom and power proved by the natural philosophers, is equally anthropo- morphic and less amenable to the life of religion. But the principle of plenitude allows him to find easy solutions of the problem of evil. Without the mosquito and the rattle- snake the world would be less full and less perfect ; we must endure these productions of the divine plan, it seems, with metaphysical piety. Mr. Merrill does at least indicate that the main argument is confused; for the existence of a limited sort of wisdom is inferred from the scheme of nature, and it is then supposed that the wisdom is perfect and that this is the best of all possible worlds. Bolingbroke stands apart from most of the deists in rejecting the moral arguments for immortality. He perceives in the arguments for the immateriality of the soul advanced by Wollaston 'the old trite chimera ' of Platonic philosophy. Platonism is his lordship's bete noire and he is nver tired of ranting against the a priori metaphysicians from Pythagoras to Cudworth and Clarke. The'most sinister influence of metaphysics is to be found in theology; it has led the priests to corrupt the natural religion of reasonable men. Unfortunately Bolingbroke often has recourse to a priori notions him- self. He accepts, for instance, the current belief in the divine origin and the uniformity of reason, though he is always anxious to insist that it must be employed according to the methods of empirical science. Mr. Merrill asserts that Bolingbroke developed a more considerable theory of ethics than other deists. But his theory appears to be sadly incoherent. At one time he declares that the principle of the law of nature is benevolence. In the Reflections on Innate Moral Principles all moral principles are said to be founded on self-love. Mr. Merrill valiantly tries to reconcile the contradiction, but the result is the appearance of two opposing principles of nature. Pope, I think, was wiser. The Bolingbroke of popular scandal is revealed in the chapter on Priestcraft, Metaphysics, and Theology. Mr. Merrill takes the trouble to describe at some length the sketch of Church history</page><page sequence="2">172 JBOOK REVIEWS given in Volume IV of the Works, where the writer's anti-clericalism is most violently displayed and where the superficiality of his reading of history is most painfully exposed. In the criticism of revelation he enters further than other deists into historical criteria. Bolingbroke's philosophical writings are filled with inconsistencies and sweeping prejudices. Mr. Merrill has described his deism fairly, but we can well understand why deism collapsed after the publication of the Works. M. H. CARRa</page></plain_text>
