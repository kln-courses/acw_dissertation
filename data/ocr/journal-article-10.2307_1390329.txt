<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESSAYS Santayana and Buddhism: The Choice between the Cross and the Bo Tree Paul Grimley Kuntz Emory University Santayana honors Gotama Buddha as a profound religious genius as well as an orig- inal philosopher. Gotama's way is genuine spiritual wisdom, and constantly com- pared with Christian mysticism as a way of enlightenment. It is therefore understand- able that a Spaniard, who learned his catechism in Avila, and who was educated in the New England of Emerson and other Transcendentalists who honored Oriental wisdom, should have so much to say about the Buddha and Buddhism. The effort of this paper is to gather many of the isolated passages to give a coher- ent picture of Santayana and Buddhism. One difficulty to be overcome is that the philosopher rarely quotes his sources (the exception is a single quotation from Das- gupta). Although Santayana has numerous opinions, he does not reveal on which translations he has relied. Nor does he contrast different traditions of Buddhists. To overcome the vagueness of scholarship, I have used the volumes found in Widener Library: the sorts of books known to Santayana's dissertation director, Josiah Royce, and those of a sympathetic sort that had led Santayana as early as the writing of his dissertation on Rudolf Hermann Lotze to reject the latter's defiantly Christian and Western contempt for oriental "superstition." The sympathy can be expressed as sim- ilar to that of Schopenhauer in reading the Upanishads or Wilhelm von Humboldt in studying the Bhagavadgita. Santayana's study makes him aware of his Catholicism but he is unlike the Jesuit Dahlmann who attacks Buddhism as Nihilism. Santayana is more like his contemporaries who worked in psychology and philosophy of reli- gion. Although Friedrich Heiler's work' and writings of James Bissett Pratt2 were a bit too late to have influenced Santayana, comparison serves to illuminate and strengthen Santayana's conclusions. Perhaps Heiler is even more appropriate because Buddhistic insights remind him of those of St. Theresa. Santayana would support Pratt's view that Nirvana is not the annihilation of all desire but the extinguishing of evil passions. What Santayana finds congenial in Christian Neo-Platonism and in Spinoza, as well as in Buddhism, is the achievement of freedom of the spirit.3 It has become a commonplace of world history that the two greatest founders of religion whose ways of salvation triumphed in Europe and in Asia respectively are the Christ and the Buddha. Philosophers of religion like Heiler accept both as saviors with a universal message, one, Jesus "the master of prayer" ("der Meister des Gebets), the Buddhist-Christian Studies 20 (2000). ? by University of Hawai'i Press.

Santa- yana is not concerned with the fact of the success of their missions, for there are indeed other triumphs such as Mohammed's Islam, and if it be classified as a religion, Marx's Communism. Santayana is hardly offering his services as a philosophic medi- ator, as Whitehead tries to do in Religion in the Making, to bring the two commu- nities of faith to a closer approximation of a truly universal religion.4 Santayana reveals great personal depth as he ponders the contrast between the Gospel and the Fourfold Noble Truth. What is the appeal of Christ on the Cross dying "to save us?" What is the appeal of "the serene Buddha, lifting the finger of meditation and profound counsel?"5 These questions are asked in a meditation in Soliloquies in England in the sympathetic way of those American philosophers who like Pratt have the option of remaining Christian or converting to Buddhism. Wil- liam James might well have patted Santayana on the back for struggling with the alternatives, for wrestling with a live option. Probably because of Buddha's message of truth, Santayana has shifted from religion as poetry, which James considered "rot- ten," to how "a general truth about existence and experience" is symbolized poeti- cally, which James would consider healthy. In answering the question "What does the cross signify?" Santayana strips away the "various analogies, legal, sentimental, or chivalrous," and he must here be think- ing of St. Anselm's Cur Deus Homo, to get behind "legal redemption," paying the Devil with Jesus' life for the sin of Adam, to the "moral sense." Santayana concludes in a robust Jamesian way: "I respect the sentiments of duty and devotion which this doctrine . . . can inspire." We may suppose here that Santayana would be happier with the Gospel of Buddha for the preaching of Dharma, as in the Dhammapada, without any theology of legalistic "celestial diplomacy." After all, as lay people and ascetics practice the way of the Buddha and the way of the Christ, they abhor vice in thought, word, and deed, and seek true virtue. Behind the theology and even deeper than the morality, in which we can find many similarities, there is the ontological question, at the heart of metaphysics, of the destiny of spirit in the flesh. Here Santayana finds common ground. "The cross can mean something else [besides repaying God the Father for Adam's insulting dis- obedience]; it can symbolize poetically a general truth about existence and experi- ence. The truth is the same which the Indians express more philosophically by say- ing that life is an illusion-an expression which is itself figurative and poetical." Maya, which concerned Santayana profoundly and frequently, does not mean that we do not know we are alive in the world which appears to us. These are not illusions. What "the Indian sages meant is that it is fugitive and treacherous: the images and persons ... are unsubstantial, and the sense of self is the most shifting and unsubstantial of all." Not only is there no strict correspondence between our units of awareness and discourse and what is real, but the obverse is true. Thus, the common complaint of the skeptic: "Life is an illusion if we trust it, but it is truth if we do not trust it...." This same truth, that spirit has aim other than those of ani- mal life, is told from two perspectives. We should expect Santayana, because of his traditional Neo-Platonism and Spinozism, to favor the calm vision of the spirit lib- erated from the flesh. The Buddhistic view seems to convince Santayana that he is 152</page><page sequence="3">THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROSS AND THE BO TREE more Christian, and we might say more Spanish Catholic, than he ordinarily allows us to suppose. The Cross is certainly a most violent image, putting suffering and death before us with a rude emphasis; I can understand the preference of many for the serene Bud- dha, lifting the finger of meditation and profound counsel, freeing the soul by the sheer force of knowledge and of sweet reason. Nevertheless, I am not sorry to have been born a Christian, for the soul cannot be really freed except by ceasing to live; and it is whilst we still exist, not after we are dead to existence, that we need coun- sel. It is therefore the crucified spirit, not the liberated spirit, that is our true master. This comes close to saying that Christ is a "truer" savior than Buddha. Santa- yana's genius emerges in the ability to see both sides of a complex choice. He is tell- ing Christians how enlightening Buddhism is as a philosophy, yet he is also telling Buddhists how profound the Christian religion is. "Certainly the spirit is crucified, first by being incarcerated in the flesh at all, and then again, after it has identified itself with the will of the flesh, by being compelled to renounce it. Yet both this painful incarnation and this painful redemption have something marvelously sweet about them." It is the presence of the Buddha and awareness of his Fourfold Noble Truth in contrast to Maya that forces upon Santayana the discriminating judgment of what in his own inherited Christianity is the wisdom of the Cross and the folly of the Cross. The best that Santayana can say for the Christian Gospel can be summarized as fol- lows: Christ dies for the world because he loves the world, and He loves the world because it is beautiful. The worst that he can say for Christianity is that Christians "erect suffering into an end in itself, which is insane and monstrous." There is an idolatrous asceticism. Is Santayana right in his claim that "Christ loved the world, in an erotic sense in which Buddha did not love it ... ?" Is Santayana right that "the world has loved the cross as it can never love the Bo tree?" Is Santayana right that the Buddhist cannot be "human and friendly" with "true insight, true mercy, . . . tender and sensitive to the infinite pulsations of ignorance and passion?" Can't a reading of the Buddha and of Buddhism also stress compassion for all life? The wisdom that leads Santayana to say that his "instinct is to go and stand under the cross" might also lead him to go and sit under the Bo tree.6 As for foolish asceticism, has Santayana seen the images of Gotama starved to skin and bones? Gotama's turn to moderation against excess is a more effective protest than even the Rule of St. Benedict. It is not only Christian wisdom but Buddhist also that could say: "There is an asceticism which may be loved for its simplicity, its clean poverty and cold water hygienic like mountain air. ..." "In spite of the truth that life is suffering, because spirit is trapped by the flesh in a transient and deceptive world, driven by desire for what is illusory and imperma- nent, is there wisdom to find a way of living well?" Santayana has asked the right question. Can we find in both the Christ and the Buddha ways that give us 'freedom andpeace?" What Santayana has given us is a sympathetic survey. There follows an inventory of the many right philosophic questions (italics mine). Ten questions bear- ing on the choice between the Cross and the Bo Tree may be outlined for clarity: 153</page><page sequence="4">PAUL GRIMLEY KUNTZ 1. If the first truth is that life is suffering, what other truths are there to provide an understanding of the cause and cure of suffering? 2. Does the Eightfold Noble Path provide "wisdom to find a way of living well?" 3. Does not Buddhism as well as Christianity contain many examples of the morbid asceticism that the Buddha, as well as the Christ who loved the world, taught their followers to eschew? 4. Why does not the Buddha's skepticism about spiritual substance undermine the practical aim to save the spirit? 5. How can a metaphysical skepticism coherently retain what it employs in its truth and way, Karma and reincarnation? 6. Is Buddhism right in its vision of an endless succession of lives needed, at least by some, for liberation? 7. Does Buddhism liberate Christians from their short-sighted vision of history? 8. Does Buddhism liberate Christians from their exclusive concentration on one Christ? 9. Does Buddhism liberate Christians from their preoccupation with eschatology and escape from the wrath of God? 10. Does Buddhism liberate Christians from missionary zeal of a political sort? I. If the first truth is that life is suffering, what other truths are there to provide an understanding of the cause and cure of suffering? Buddhism enlightens us and relieves us of our ignorance about foolish desires. Man is, in metaphors Santayana could have used, "as a locust [which] will fly into the flame of a lamp, or a man that is greedy after honey will lick the honey-smeared edge of a knife."7 Is man, asks Santayana, because he lives as all animals "trust[ing] their senses," doomed by desire, and therefore should not the enlightened man "if he [were] consistent, to stop living?" This is an oversimplification that leads us to ignore "massive moral experience" and leads us into "incidental sophistries with no hold on the spirit."8 If the cause is foolish desire, then the cure is wise desire, and contem- plation can lead to peace and joy which escape not existence altogether, but that vio- lent change which is the problem. We do not have "static being," for if this could be our state, we "should lapse or rise into essences, and should not exist . . " (Realms of Being, "Study of Alternative Beliefs," p. 648). The same enlightenment that leads us to include ourselves in the impermanence of existence also leads us to identify ourselves with bliss.9 II. Does the Eightfold Noble Path provide "wisdom to find a way of living well?" Buddhism does offer a "way of living well," and Santayana presupposes, as a Neo- Platonic Christian, what he has argued as the disillusionment of the spirit with merely worldly striving and ambition. One such summary of the Dhammapada states the way: The avoidance of every evil deed, the working out of the good, the denial of one's own heart, that is the teaching of the Buddha. Mercy and compassion 154</page><page sequence="5">THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROSS AND THE BO TREE are highest Nirvana-the Buddhas call it the highest Nirvana-for one is not one who renounces, who harms another, and one who makes another sick is no ascetic. Not to be contemptuous, not to harm others, are the litany of rules we confess, moderation in eating, at the same place to lie and sit, eagerness in reflection: that is the teaching of the Buddhas.10 Santayana is not in all respects convinced of the superiority of the morality he characterizes in The Life of Reason as "post-rational." From a rational perspective, Buddhist pity is once condemned as "purely negative" (The Life of Reason: Reason in Science, Vol. 5, p. 285). Again, the way of compassion has the limitation of the "pathetic feminine quality" of being good for pity's sake (ibid., p. 293). Yet as a con- templative in sympathy with the East, he defends remedial ethics. If there is something in a purely remedial system of morality which seems one- sided and extreme, we must call to mind the far less excusable one-sidedness of those moralities of prejudice to which we are accustomed in the Occident-the ethics of irrational acquisitiveness, irrational faith, and irrational honor. Buddhistic morality, so reasonable and beautifully persuasive, rising so willingly to the ideal of sanctity, merits in comparison the profoundest respect (ibid., p. 294). III. Does not Buddhism as well as Christianity contain many examples of the mor- bid asceticism that the Buddha, as well as the Christ who loved the world, taught their followers to eschew? Morbid asceticism may be based, argues Santayana, on an exaggerated stripping of nature of its life and beauty, and reducing human life to its most abhorrent aspects. Santayana's response to the kind of memento mori of Buddhism is clear. l Why, then, is nature dead, although it swarms with living organisms, if every part is not obviously animate? And why is the sun dark and cold, if it is bright and hot only to animal sensibility? This senseless lamentation is like the sophism of those Indian preachers who, to make men abandon the illusions of self-love, dilated on the shocking contents of the human body. Take off the skin, they cried, and you will dis- cover nothing but loathsome bleeding and quivering substances. Yet the inner organs are well enough in their place and doubtless pleasing to the microbes that inhabit them; and a man is not hideous because his cross-section would not offer the fea- tures of a beautiful countenance (ibid., pp. 91-92). IV. Why does not the Buddha's skepticism about spiritual substance undermine the practical aim to save the spirit? Gotama attacked the traditional way of salvation which was based on identifying atman with Brahman. If experience is of transient existence, spirit is no exception. The very question of whether the world is eternal is said to be one of the "questions which tend not to edification." Santayana, whose own skepticism was founded on British empiricism, especially Hume's, recognizes the kinship of this tradition with Buddhistic skepticism. "In the most opposite quarters, in Buddhism and in British philosophy, the existence of spirit is verbally denied, as being a verbal fiction: accord- 155</page><page sequence="6">PAUL GRIMLEY KUNTZ ing to one party there are only illusions and according to the other party only data" (Realms of Being, "Study of Alternative Beliefs," p. 648). The combination of skepticism with spirituality may seem paradoxical. How can "spirit" be liberated, if there is no such thing? If there is no real self, only changing and unreliable impressions, what is there to be saved? We can still be what we are, what our thoughts, words, and deeds have made us, and what our thoughts, words, and deeds will make us, even though we are not sub- strates in the sense of eternal and unchanging underlying substances. The practical aim of liberating our experience from foolish desire that brings sorrow can be fulfilled more successfully without unnecessary speculation about the eternality and identity of atman and Brahman. Santayana turns our attention to the practical aim of con- templation. V. How can a metaphysical skepticism coherently retain what it employs in its truth and way, Karma and reincarnation? Santayana gives no account, following some Buddhist sources, of a person as five skandas and mere rupa without atman, but he allows something that continues through the changes of each life and many lives.12 The metaphysical skepticism of the Buddha takes a nominalistic turn of attacking the object of a name. A name is a "mere empty sound." "There is no Nagasena."13 How can an anti-metaphysician, it is often asked of the Buddha, who has, as Hume, deconstructed dogma, be so con- fident of the highly metaphysical doctrine of Karma, which in Buddhist thought as in Hinduism, is always accompanied by reincarnation? Santayana is quite willing to defend the Buddha's coherence: It does not follow that these names, and the sentiment each mutely awakens, are similar to the substance they indicate, or form any part of that substance. Even the barking of the dog, not to speak of the dog himself, is not very like the bow-wow of the childish vocabulary. I see no necessity that our ideas of matter or of God should be truer than that; yet they have substantial and unequivocal objects. If, for instance, in denying that persons exist, a philoso- pher like Buddha had meant that the idea we commonly form of persons does not rightly describe the substance at work in those places, he might have been more than justified; a supposed spiritual substance called the soul is not eas- ily to be found there; but he could hardly have maintained his negation if he had meant that there is no substance of any sort for which the idea of persons is a conventional mask. In fact Buddha himself implicitly believed in Karma, a principle of inheritance and continuity which was the parent of all illusions and the substance of our imaginary selves. No doubt this conception of Karma, like the notion of a person, needs to be clarified; but it is a splendid instrument of moral synthesis, and describes the operations of substance in one important respect, though doubtless without understanding the mechanism which actu- ally subtends human character and moral inheritance (Obiter Scripta, pp. 182-183). 156</page><page sequence="7">THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROSS AND THE BO TREE What is it that continues, if it cannot be substance, that explains the identity of the self through change? How is there a continuity between different lives such that the thoughts, words, and deeds of one life account for the results, good or bad, in a successive life? What or how may never be answered, yet the unquestioned presup- positions may yet be true, and at least they serve to help us to live wisely. Is this what Santayana means by Buddha's "splendid instrument of moral synthesis?"14 VI. Is Buddhism right in its vision of an endless succession of lives needed, at least by some, for liberation? Sometimes the Buddhistic problem is stated by Santayana as the obligation of Buddhists "to introduce an ambiguous equivalent in the heritage of guilt, ignorance, and illusion which they call Karma" (Skepticism andAnimal Faith, p. 148). At other times, less theoretically and less critical of what seems a dogma or unexamined pre- supposition, Santayana recognizes Gotama's problem of a "final release" from the bondage of suffering. Santayana recognizes that some Buddhists speak of a thousand or a hundred thou- sand existences, "many periods of the destruction of the world, and many periods of the reconstitution of the world." 15 How, on practical grounds, does he understand and defend such a vision? For all to be liberated will require more time than Chris- tians have allowed, and the Buddhist view is more charitable: In Buddhism the same charity wears a more speculative form. All beings are to be redeemed from the illu- sion which is the fountain of their troubles. None is to be compelled to assume irra- tionally an alien set of duties or functions other than his own. Spirit is not to be incarcerated perpetually in grotesque and accidental monsters, but to be freed from all fatality and compulsion. The goal is not some more flatter- ing incarnation, but escape from incarnation altogether. Ignorance is to be enlight- ened, passion calmed, mistaken destiny revoked; only what the inmost being desires, only what can really quiet the longings embodied in any particular will, is to occupy the redeemed mind. Here, though creative reason is wholly wanting, charity is truly understood; for it avails little to make of kindness a vicarious selfishness and to use neighborly offices to plunge our neighbor deeper into his favorite follies. Such ser- vile sympathy would make men one another's accomplices rather than friends. It would treat them with a weak promiscuous favor, not with true mercy and justice. In charity there can be nothing to repent of, as there so often is in natural love and partisan propaganda. Christians have sometimes interpreted charity as zeal to bring men into their particular fold; or, at other times, when enthusiasm for doctrine and institutes has cooled, they have interpreted charity to be mere blind cooperation, no matter in what (Life of Reason: Reason in Religion, Vol. 5, pp. 224-225). VII. Does Buddhism liberate Christians from their short-sighted vision of history? Most Westerners, even those historians who are not aware, as Santayana is, of Christian presuppositions, complain about the lack of temporal records of Indian life comparable to the chronicling we take for granted. Santayana appreciates the</page><page sequence="8">PAUL GRIMLEY KUNTZ timelessness of Buddhistic awareness, and the universality in acknowledgment of the needs of all creatures. Human history becomes merely incidental to the cosmic flux, and Santayana recommends this metaphysical correction as liberating us from prej- udice. Sheep are providentially designed for men; but why not also for wolves, and men for worms and microbes? If the historian is willing to accept such a suggestion, and to become a blind worshipper of success, applauding every issue, however lamenta- ble for humanity, and calling it admirable tragedy, he may seem for a while to save his theory by making it mystical; yet presently this last illusion will be dissipated when he loses his way in the maze and finds that all victors perish in their turn and, if you look far enough, everything falls back into the inexorable vortex. This is the sort of observation that the Indian sages made long ago; it is what renders their phi- losophy, for all its practical importance, such an irrefragable record of experience, such a superior, definitive perception of the flux. Beside it, our progresses of two cen- turies and our philosophies of history embracing one-quarter of the earth for three thousand years seem puerile vistas indeed. Shall all eternity and all existence be for the sake of what is happening here today, and to me? Shall we strive manfully to the top of this particular wave, on the ground that its foam is the culmination of all for- ever (Life of Reason: Reason in Science, Vol. 5, pp. 56-57)? VIII. Does Buddhism liberate Christians from their exclusive concentration on one Christ? Although we have fallen into the habit, following Santayana's choice between the Cross and the Bo tree, of thinking comparatively of "the Christ," the Messiah or Anointed One, and "the Buddha," the Enlightened One as "though both were Saviours," are there not very many differences between these conceptions? One of them is that Christians make Christ the center of historical time, and date all events since the coming of the one and only Incarnation of God in flesh. But a Buddha does not demand uniqueness. Indeed Buddhas reappear. "After a certain lapse of time his teaching is corrupted and lost, and is not restored till a new Buddha appears." "In the older texts of the canon there were six, in the recent texts there are twenty-four previous Buddhas. The last prophesied the coming of the future Bud- dha Metteyya.... "16 The Apostles of Christ thought the time was short in which they could strive to escape, and urge others to escape, the "wrath to come" and to prepare for the joys of the messianic fulfillment. This kind of prophetic illusion is corrected, as Santayana analyzes it, by the mystical message of Buddhists. IX. Does Buddhism liberate Christians from their preoccupation with eschatology and escape from the wrath of God? Santayana's tolerance of alternative ways of life is partly based on a revulsion to persecution that has characterized Christendom. The zeal to convert that becomes the zeal to replace heresy with orthodoxy is, by contrast, according to Santayana, rel- atively absent.</page><page sequence="9">THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROSS AND THE BO TREE Those who were inwardly convinced-as most religious minds were under the Roman Empire-that all earthly things were vanity, and that they plunged the soul into an abyss of nothingness if not of torment, could, in view of brighter possibili- ties in another world, carry their asceticism and their cult of suffering farther than a purely negative system, such as the Buddhistic, would have allowed. For a discipline that is looked upon as merely temporary can contradict nature more boldly than one intended to take nature's place. The hope of unimaginable benefits to ensue could drive religion to greater frenzies than it could have fallen into if its object had been merely to silence the will. Christianity persecuted, tortured, and burned. Like a hound it tracked the very scent of heresy. It kindled wars, and nursed furious hatreds and ambitions. It sanctified, quite like Mohammedanism, extermination and tyr- anny. All this would have been impossible if, like Buddhism, it had looked only to peace and the liberation of souls. It looked beyond; it dreamt of infinite blisses and crowns it should be crowned with before an electrified universe and an applauding God. These were rival baits to those which the world fishes with, and were snapped at, when seen, with no less avidity. Man, far from being freed from his natural pas- sions, was plunged into artificial ones quite as violent and much more disappoint- ing. Buddhism had tried to quiet a sick world with anesthetics; Christianity sought to purge it with fire (Life of Reason: Reason in Science, Vol. 5, pp. 285-286). X. Does Buddhism liberate Christians from missionary zeal of a political sort? The missionary success of Buddhism is very different, according to Santayana, and mostly superior. What was he thinking of when he referred to the more "virile intel- lect" of the Christian that partly redeems its aggressiveness? I think it likely that the Dominican effort to convert Moslems would in St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Contra Gentiles be the kind of straightforward reasoning Santayana had failed to find in Buddhism. The Buddhists seem to have shown a finer sense in their ministry, knowing how to combine universal sympathy with perfect spirituality. There was no browbeating in their call to conversion, no new tyranny sanctioned by their promised deliverance. If they could not rise to a positive conception of natural life, this inability but marks the well-known limitations of Oriental fancy, which has never been able to distin- guish steadily that imagination which rests on and expresses material life from that which, in its import, breaks loose from the given conditions of life altogether, and is therefore monstrous and "dreamful." But at least Buddhism knew how to sound the heart and pierce to the genuine principles of happiness and misery. If it did not venture to interpret reason positively, it at least forbore to usurp its inward and autonomous authority, and did not set up, in the name of salvation, some new par- tiality, some new principle of distress and illusion. In destroying worldliness this reli- gion avoided imposture. The clearing it made in the soul was soon overgrown again by the inexorable Indian jungle; but had a virile intellect been at hand, it would have been free to raise something solid and rational in the space so happily swept clean of all accumulated rubbish (Reason in Religion, pp. 225-226). Had Santayana been a Catholic of Franciscan rather than of Dominican inclina- 159</page><page sequence="10">PAUL GRIMLEY KUNTZ tion, that is more a follower of St. Bonaventura than of St. Thomas, he might well have become a Buddhist. For a good case can be developed, based upon the contrasts above, that Buddhist teaching is of a high degree of selfless compassion and its record of charity towards all far less blemished by hate than that of Christianity. Santayana was very sensitive to the claims that Christ is the supreme example of divine love from the early tragic poem Lucifer to the late meditation The Idea of Christ in the Gospels; yet his reading of Buddhism has less stress on compassion than we find in many sources. Buddhists are taught universal friendship (metta) that pities friend and foe alike, not restricted, as are Christian prayers for those of "the household of faith." In some respects compassion goes beyond anything in the Christian tradition.17 A hunter intending to kill his prey must bear the reward of Karma (manasika).18 The Jataka stories have the most fantastic emphasis on self-sacrifice. Such willingness to pluck out an eye has more of the sacrificial temper than the destruction of the offending member, as in Christ's counsel.19 The prayer from Suraruapabhase, Chapter 4, is scarcely equaled anywhere: "May those troubled by hunger and thirst be satisfied, may the blind see the multitudinous shapes and patterns, and may doves hear lovely sounds!"20 Heiler agrees with Santayana's objection to the use of charitable acts to further the political institution of religion. "Yet Buddhism is to be recognized, as is mystical piety generally, with the teaching of Caritas, the sympathetic and construc- tive brotherly love valued only as an approach to completely unsocial ideal of salva- tion." 21 As we move from this survey of contrasts between Buddhism and Christianity two critical remarks are in order. The first concerns kinds of Buddhism, and the second Nirvana. Earlier one of the complaints registered against Santayana's account of Bud- dhism was that he never distinguishes between Hinayana and Mahayana. The second lack must have become evident. Santayana also fails to give an analysis of Nirvana. On one hand, the account of Buddhism makes it into a timeless essence and fails to trace the historical differences between the original way of monks and the many sub- sequent developments among many different peoples of the Far East from Sri Lanka to Tibet to Japan. This is a deficiency in a writer who knows the differences between the varied national traditions of Catholics and Protestants. If Santayana as a philoso- pher can be excused for lack of history of religions, surely a metaphysician concerned with mysticism should give us an account of the meanings of Nirvana. My first argument is that Santayana does not really neglect Hinayana and Maha- yana, as they are commonly understood. There is in Santayana's account of Bud- dhism an implicit recognition that it can take the form of individual self-salvation by detachment and knowledge or a more social form of the bodhisattva, who turns from his own Buddhahood, to help bring others towards salvation. According to the first version, "'moral redemption' . . . touches the individual only, just as death does. Christ and Buddha are called saviors of the world; I think it must be in irony, for the world is just as much in need of salvation as ever. Death and insight and salva- tion are personal. The world springs up unregenerate every morning in spite of all the Tabors and Calvaries of yesterday. What can save the world . . . is self-knowl- 160</page><page sequence="11">THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROSS AND THE BO TREE edge" (Soliloquies in England, p. 96). How can we make a transition from individ- ual salvation ("not to lay up treasures, except in heaven") to a social view? "What dif- ference does it make in reality whether the suffering and ignominy of life fall to what I call myself or to what I call another man" (ibid.)? Buddhism as Christianity-"the two most spiritual religions"-says Santayana, is "anthropomorphic" in replacing "cosmic and thundering deities" like Zeus with moral heroes like Prometheus. With the concern for human salvation, judges Santayana, religion becomes rational (Life of Reason: Reason in Society, Vol. 2, p. 204). My second argument, about Santayana's failing to analyze Nirvana, is based upon my first argument. If the merit of Gotama's way of salvation is to bring the spirit free- dom and peace, then it can be characterized positively in moral terms; both Buddha and Christ can be presented as moral heroes. Only certain kinds of mysticism, or mysticism in a qualified sense attracted Santayana, who once said that if he is a mys- tic at all, he should be called a "Castilian mystic." That is, there is a dangerous mys- ticism that not only denies any characterization of what the mystic encounters, but subordinates all virtues to this single end. All virtues, says St. Juan de la Cruz, are by-paths diverging from the difficult way whose name is Nothing, Nothing, Nothing. Heiler reminds us that this formula is paralleled by na iti, na iti, na iti. 22 Santayana's argument against this is that he has accepted some positive characterization of sal- vation, as the attainment of freedom and bliss. He could appeal to many students who say of Nirvana that it is "a state of the individual described as bliss and free- dom...."23 "Inner freedom" best characterizes Nirvana.24 Negative theology, when it suspends the validity of moral discrimination, ends up in accepting the natural world as beyond good and evil. Therefore Santayana argues against Stoic Pantheism and German Absolutism. "For Buddhist as for Christian salvation, the world as such is fallen. The world of German Absolutism, like the Stoic world, was not fallen. On the contrary, it was divinely inspired and altogether authoritative; he alone who did not find his place and function in it was unholy and perverse. This world worship, despising heartily every finite and rational ideal, gives to impulse and fact, whatever they may be, liberty to flourish under a divine warrant" (Life of Reason: Reason in Religion, Vol. 3, pp. 173-174). A systematic reason Santayana has for keeping a positive meaning for salvation is that the realms of being are not the stark duality of existence and spirit but include the mediating realms of essence and truth. Gotama himself may have been nomi- nalistic in denying real universals and his analysis of the meanings of names seems to presuppose that only particulars exist. To end foolish desires, then, is to detach spirit from particular existences, and there is nothing else for spirit to be attached to. Santayana states this clearly: "When the Indians tell us that such peace is bliss we may be inclined to smile and call them pessimists, as if only the negation of exis- tence could seem to them good" (Realms of Being, p. 668). Yet, responds Santayana, in his Platonistic way, there are, in a sense other than material existence, the realm of essence and also the realm of truth. Therefore Santayana has a metaphysical ground for the bliss of enlightened spirit: it learns to contemplate essences (and truths). "Anxiety and craving would dissolve before this redeeming knowledge, and</page><page sequence="12">PAUL GRIMLEY KUNTZ the universe would be clarified into a complex essence, given pure and untroubled to intuition. Spirit, so enlightened, would again be at peace" (Realms of Being, p. 667). This positive metaphysical objectivity of contemplation can be found in Buddhist texts and Santayana could have defended it.25 CONCLUSION We began with Santayana's existential problem of choosing between remaining Cath- olic or becoming Buddhist. In his own vivid images, should he yield to the instinct of going to stand under the Cross? Or should he yield to the instinct of going to sit under the Bo tree? Here is the philosopher struggling with the live option of con- sidering the crucifix as a symbol of life, in contrast, to cite the symbol he could have used, the wheel of Dharma. Santayana's writing about this choice deserves now to be far better known because American youth, sometimes in disillusionment with the progress and spiritual poverty of Western life, turns to the wisdom of the East for possible guidance. Zen Buddhism, which Santayana does not mention, but proba- bly knew, was well known at Harvard because of Okakura Kakuzo's Book of Tea.26 Santayana is one of the early leaders in rejecting prejudices against what initially seems so exotic and even absurd, and teaching us the respect for alternative traditions that is now the essence of world citizenship. We have brought Santayana's study of Buddhism under ten points of contrast to Christianity, and on balance most of them count in favor of Buddhism. Why, therefore, we must ask, did Santayana not become a Buddhist? Santayana does not become a Buddhist because although he may well have had a stronger "instinct to go and sit under the Bo tree than to go and to stand under the Cross," he had good reasons for not yielding to either instinct. The choice is indeed a "vital choice" but it is not a "forced option." Through Spinoza he also gained one form of the wisdom called "ultimate religion," and there is in the Western tradition, for he was a reader of Platonism, what he expressed in Platonism and the Spiritual Life. "Buddha teaches that all beings are from eternity abiding in Nirvana." This means for Santayana that there is the whole realm of essences, including Pure Being with infinite implications for spirit (Platonism and the Spiritual Life, p. 81). A West- erner like Santayana may, as did Father Thomas Merton, imagine himself to have exchanged his black for a saffron robe, and felt quite at home taking refuge in the Buddha, in the Dharma, in the Sangha, yet the sympathy is the exercise of imagi- native possibility. There is no necessity to actualize the possibility, much difficulty in trying to change so much, even impossibility in being other than he has become, through Spanish birth and heritage: a Catholic. Hence the best we can do is to exer- cise the art of dialectic, "to see both sides yet to choose neither." Santayana does not become a Buddhist, or even an active Catholic, because, as he knows them in history, movements are ambiguous. They are not really the ful- fillment of the high ideals of their founders. Spiritual geniuses like the Christ and the Buddha renounce the world, yet the institutions of their followers must live in 162</page><page sequence="13">THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROSS AND THE BO TREE the world. One may be drawn to the initial ideal, yet find oneself not freed in spirit, but by commitment to a movement, enmeshed in politics. A greatly inspired prophet like Buddha would have at once renounced his throne and his family. Even this might not have sufficed. The professed and professional prophet is sometimes entangled in a worse net than a king. He may be led into self- assertion, into denunciations, into controversy; he may find himself working reputed miracles and inspiring fables that he must wink at; he will probably be utterly misunderstood; a sect betraying his thought if not his person will follow at his heels. Martyrdom, in such a case, would not be an escape; it would turn him into a myth, into an idol. He mentions that monarchs who have been spiritual men- Marcus Aurelius, Saint Louis, Henry VI-have been unfortunate politically. Why, when discussing the Buddhist difficulty in freeing the spirit from the fetishes of religion that make quarrels in this world, did he not mention Ashoka?27 Ashoka "was undoubtedly the most powerful sovereign of his time and the most remarkable and imposing of the native rulers of India."28 Santayana does not become a Bud- dhist because he did not learn the subtle categories and logics of Indian thought well enough to use them in constructing his system. He had his own Western categories, partly from Plato and Aristotle, which he had studied in Greek, and he knew the traditional logical moves of the Scholastics whom he knew in Latin, and he had a fine grasp of modern philosophy in English, French, and German. He could scarcely have been expected, like Josiah Royce, to learn Sanskrit, and to master Buddhist phi- losophy, to learn Pali. Furthermore, the lack of scholarship is hardly to be regretted because his own philosophy served all the moral and spiritual needs which religions are designed to serve. Santayana has done better than to have become a Buddhist. In his own way, through his philosophy, he has become a Buddha. Christians may well regret his many heresies and apostasy. But Buddhists should rejoice, even though he did not become a Buddhist, to consider him another Buddha. What he offers to explain as part of his wisdom is the wisdom of the Cross. NOTES 1. In another essay "Santayana and the Indians" I have shown that Santayana does not sharply distinguish between Hinduism and Buddhism. A part of this study was published as "Finding the Thread of Salvation in this Labyrinth of Folly: Santayana's Philosophy Expressed in Terns of Karma and Dharma," in Philosophy in the Life of a Nation (New York: CUNY, 1976, pp. 140-144). Friedrich Heiler, Die Buddhistische Versenkung (Munich, 1922), follows Oldenberg and Beck on the similarities between Buddhism and Brahminism. Heiler dismisses the miraculous as accidental to the essential spiritual quest for liberation. Similarly Santayana's kind of natu- ralism, having taken account of the Realm ofMatter, goes on to Essence, Truth, and above all, to Spirit. Heiler would agree that naturalism does not spell the end of mysticism: "The mirac- ulous ... occurrences are not the goal of contemplation, but only by-products, which fall into the lap of the saints. They are signs of grace which confirm that he has followed the right path and that salvation is not far off. The true goal of the striving for salvation is Nirvana. The fourth jhana is the immediate vestibule to salvation" (translation mine), p. 36. 163</page><page sequence="14">PAUL GRIMLEY KUNTZ 2.

I wish that I could quote the whole thousand words rather than select and analyze this remarkable meditation. 6. The most remarkable Christian confession Santayana ever made is coupled with a rejec- tion, typical of post-Tridentine rejection of heresies, but put on a philosophical basis: "My instinct is to go and stand under the cross, with the monks and the crusaders, far away from those Jews and Protestants who adore the world and who govern it." 7.

With the development of this doctrine they gave great emphasis to this point. Things came to view at one moment and the next moment they were destroyed. Whatever is existent is momentary." On the other hand, Buddhism could draw on the tradition of the true self. Even if not eter- nal atman, still the self can be bliss. The Buddha's point is to press the argument that what is not eternal is sorrow against Upanishadic orthodoxy. "The postulate of the Buddha is that which is changing is sorrow, [but] whatever is sorrow is not self" (p. 110). 10. M. Winternitz, Der Altere Buddhismus (Tiibingen: Mohr, 1929), pp. 183-185. 11.

"What Ashoka meant by religion or morality (dhamma) doubtless varied the course of his life. We find that he bitterly regret- ted the slaughter involved in his conquest of the Kaliugas . . ." (E. J. Thomas, Buddhist Thought, p. 154). After his conversion he changed his title from Chandasoka, the fierce, to Dhammasoka, the righteous (Mahavamsa, translated by W. Geiger). As Santayana observes, without complete conversion there is emphasis upon external acts, that are of the world rather than of the spirit, as the pilgrimage to the Bodhi tree (sambodhi). At the same time it is prob- able that, like Constantine's patronage of Christianity, his patronage of Buddhism, then the most rising and influential faith in India, was not alloyed with political motives, and it is cer- tain that his vast benefactions to the Buddhist cause was at least one of the causes that led to its decline. 28.
