<plain_text><page sequence="1">Flower Mountain Concepts of life, beauty, and paradise among the Classic Maya KARL A. TAUBE Introduction In an important, pioneering study, Jane Hill (1992) defined the extremely widespread concept of a floral paradise present among native peoples of Mesoamerica and the American Southwest. Terming it Flower World, Hill noted that this ancestral place of origin and return is closely related to the sun, heat, music, and brilliant or iridescent colors. In fact, Flower World is commonly identified with the path of the sun: "The image of the flowery road, with its prototype in the path of the sun across the heavens, is one of the most widely diffused Flower World metaphors" (ibid.:215). According to Hill, the paradisal Flower World is especially developed among Uto-Aztecan-speaking peoples, including the ancient Aztec, the contemporary Huichol, Tarahumara, and Yaqui of western Mexico, and the Hopi and O'odham of the American Southwest. In addition, Hill (ibid.:123, 134-135) noted that the Flower World complex also appears in contemporary beliefs of the Tzotzil Maya of highland Chiapas. More recently, Kelley Hays-Gilpin and Jane Hill (1999) described the presence of Flower World symbolism in ancient Puebloan art, suggesting considerable antiquity for this belief in the American Southwest. In her initial study of Flower World, Hill (1992:136) provided a number of scenarios to explain the distribution of this floral paradise among ancient and contemporary peoples of Mesoamerica and the American Southwest. According to Hill, the Flower World complex probably derived from an ancient Uto Aztecan speech community and then spread into the more distant Hopi and Maya areas. However, Hill (ibid.) also suggested that Flower World may have been introduced into other areas from southern Mesoamerica during the early dissemination of agriculture. The present study finds a good deal of support for the latter scenario. The Flower World complex is very ancient in Mesoamerica and can be traced to the Middle Formative Olmec as well as the Late Preclassic and Classic Maya. Among the ancient Maya, Flower World concerned a floral mountain that served both as an abode for gods and ancestors and as a means of ascent into the paradisal realm of the sun. The floral paradise closely related to the concept of the breath soul, a vitalizing force frequently symbolized by flowers or jade. This breath soul is also expressed by music and sweet smelling aroma, both carried by air and wind. It will also be noted that some of the secondary traits found with the Classic Maya Flower World, such as Flower Mountain and the floral breath soul, can be found with Uto-Aztecan speaking peoples, including the Aztec and Hopi. In our studies of the ancient Maya, it has become increasingly clear that they were profoundly aware of their surrounding world. However, although we have a great deal of detailed knowledge concerning pre Hispanic horticultural methods and beliefs, there has been relatively little discussion of how the ancient Maya perceived their relation to the surrounding environment. Based on modern ethnographic accounts and Classic period writing and art, Andrea Stone (1995) and I (Taube 2003a) have argued that the pre-Hispanic Maya had two opposite conceptions of space, the ordered human environments of the house, community, and fields, and the primordial world of the forest and bush. Whereas the house, town, and milpa ave socially constructed spaces of straight lines and right angles, the forest is a chaotic realm of twisted paths and tangled growth. In addition, A great deal of this study was written when I was a Resident Fellow of the Center for Ideas and Society at the University of California, Riverside. I am grateful to the Center for Ideas and Society for providing me institutional support to conduct this research. During the process of writing this study, I benefitted greatly by the comments and insights from a number of colleagues, especially Stephen Houston, Francesco Pellizzi, and David Stuart. I also wish to thank Claudia Garcia-des Lauriers for calling my attention to a number of N?huatl texts. I am indebted to Nuit Banai, Francesco Pellizzi, and an anonymous reviewer for their careful editorial comments concerning an earlier version of this text.</page><page sequence="2">70 RES 45 SPRING 2004 whereas the human spheres of the town and field are symbolically bright, diurnal regions of the sun, the forest wilds are related to darkness, caves, and the underworld. In Maya thought, the relation of people to the environment is more complex than simply a contrast between a positive world of humans and a negative world of nature. It is abundantly clear that the ancient Maya regarded certain aspects of the natural world, such as flowers and tropical birds, as things of beauty and admiration. Aside from the constructed human world of toil and effort and the threatening forest wilds, there was also a paradisal realm of flowers and beauty. Maya concepts of paradise Diego de Landa mentions that the sixteenth-century Yucatec conceived of two distinct afterlife regions, the dark underworld known as Metnal and a paradisal garden of plenty: the delights which they said they were to obtain, if they were good, were to go to a delightful place, where nothing would give them pain and where they would have an abundance of foods and drinks of great sweetness and a tree which they call yaxche, very cool and giving good shade, which is the ceiba, under the branches and the shadows they would rest and forever cease from labor (Tozzer 1941:131). Similarly, there is the contemporary Yucatec belief that at the end of the present creation there will be a gentle place of beautiful flowers and plants: "On this new surface of the earth there will be no useless trees or spiny plants but only a pleasant, lovely vegetation and fragrant flowers" (Villa Rojas 1945:151). Among contemporary Yucatec Maya, the souls of the dead are also believed to follow the road of the sun (Sosa 1985: 430, 442). On this road, the sun and the accompanying souls travel in shade, recalling the sixteenth-century description of paradise supplied by Diego de Landa (ibid:442; Tozzer 1941:131). The concept of a solar paradise is well documented among the contemporary TzotziI of highland Chiapas. A creation myth from Chenalh? describes the newly born sun rising into a celestial paradise: "there were many fruit trees, many sweet smelling flowers, ... it was much better up there" (Guiteras-Holmes 1961:186). The myth further relates that the sun and moon ascend to this realm, never to return to earth. This region is Winahel, the celestial paradise that follows the path of the sun: "it is not in the same place, because it moves with the sun, because it is the sun" (ibid.:258). For theTzotzil of San Andres Larrainzar, the sun travels a road covered with flowers (Holland 1961:168). Similarly, among theTzotzil Maya of Zinacantan, there is the flower paradise known as nichimajel, nichim being the term for flower (Laughlin 2000:104). Although the notion of a floral paradise recalls Christian ideas of the original garden of Eden and the afterlife, the solar component is wholly Mesoamerican. In addition, the concept of a solar paradise of flowers is also a very ancient belief in Mesoamerica and the American Southwest. Maya souls and flower paradise Our recent understanding of ancient Maya concepts of the afterlife have been dominated by the dark and threatening underworld. The Quichean Popol Vuh provides detailed descriptions of Xibalba, or "place of fright," a realm of death, disease, and corruption. The frequently macabre way spirits of Late Classic vessel scenes also relate to night and the underworld (see Houston and Stuart 1989; Grube and Nahm 1994). In a number of Maya languages, versions of the term way can refer to a specific soul spirit or "co-essence" of a person. Called the wayhel or chanul among theTzoztil Maya, this spirit closely relates to the character, wellbeing and fate of the individual. According to Evon Vogt (1976:33), the Tzotzil of Zinacantan consider such beings forest spirits who embody "the unruly, uncontrollable 'wild' and impulsive side of their behavior." Similarly theTzotzil of Chenalh? regard the wayhel as a wild animal related to the forest and the night (Guiteras-Holmes 1961:270, 288, 299, 301-302). The Tzotzil concept of the wild animal soul is consistent with the frequently frenetic behavior of way characters in Classic Maya vessel scenes, where they often tussle, gesticulate, or writhe in contorted poses. In addition, they commonly hold bowls of eyeballs, severed hands, and bones as their food, offerings more consistent with rituals of curing and witchcraft than with the honored ancestors. The ancient vessel scenes and contemporary Maya ethnography suggest that way are beings of the forest, darkness, and the underworld (Taube 2003a). Whereas the bestial way spirits directly relate to one's personal behavior and fate in the mortal world, there is another spirit that continues after death. Thus for the Tzotzil of Chenalh?, the wayhel dies with the individual, but the soul known as the ch'ulel ascends to the solar paradise of Winahel (Guiteras-Holmes 1961:150, 176, 270).

Vogt (1976:88) mentions that although the animal soul is of the forest wilds rather than the human community, the ch'ulel relates to a more intermediate area, the maize field. Francesco Pellizzi (pers. comm 2003) notes that whereas the animal wayhel spirit is manifested at night in sleep and dreams, the ch'ulel corresponds to the waking diurnal world of human thought and behavior (for wayhel and dreams, see Pellizzi 1996:11). Aside from the maize field, the ch'ulel closely relates to sweet-smelling flowers. Thus during the major Zinacanteco curing rite known as muk'ta nichim or "great flower," thirteen bundles of plants represent the thirteen floral components of the ch'ulel (Laughlin 1962:128). It will be seen that the ch'ulel soul also inhabits another cultivated space, a beautiful garden of flowers, fruit-bearing plants, and tropical birds.</page><page sequence="4">72 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 2. Portrayals of the wind god in Classic Maya texts. a. Early Classic wind god with woven headband and blossom on brow, Tikal Stela 31 (after Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:fig. 52). b.

Wind god appearing as /Assign in death expression referring to the termination of breath, detail of Palenque stucco text (from Houston and Taube 2000:fig. 4e). Clearly related to the Classic Mayan words for divinity, k'uh, and sacred, k'uhul, ch'ulel is theTzotzil Maya term for the inner soul specifically located in the heart and by extension, blood of people (Vogt 1969:368). Recent discussions of ancient Maya conceptions of divinity and souls have tended to focus on the importance and sacredness of blood. However, an ethereal soul centered in the heart, the ch'ulel is more than blood. At death, it is not bleeding but the utter cessation of the heart and fluttering breath that marks the end. Guiteras-Holmes (1961:296) notes the immaterial aspect of the ch'ulel among the Chenalh? Tzotzil: "It is as air; it is in the image of the body ... It is the impalpable essence of the individual. . . ." John Watanabe (1989:265) compares theTzotzil ch'ulel to the concept of the inner soul among the Mam Maya of Chimaltenango. Like the ch'ulel, the Mam inner soul is based in the heart. However, breath constitutes the soul essence, which continues after death as an ethereal "soul of the dead" (ibid.). In Ch'orti Maya belief, the wind gods blow life-giving breath into the newly born child and remove it at death (Wisdom 1940:397). According to certain Ch'orti informants, the soul of the child derives from the east, the source of all life and goodness (ibid.:427-428, n. 93). The concept of the breath soul is extremely widespread in both ancient and contemporary Mesoamerica, including the Maya region (Houston and Taube 2000; Taube 2001a). This soul relates closely to both scent, such as the sweet aroma of flowers and copal, and sound, especially music?ethereal qualities carried by wind or air. From Middle Formative Olmec art to the Late Postclassic Maya codices, the breath soul is conveyed by a carved jade or flower placed at the tip of the nose or hovering before the face (see figs. 1 a-b, 2a-b, 3b). Aside from appearing as breath elements, both flowers and jade ornaments are portrayed as living, breathing entities in Classic Maya iconography (figs. 1a, e-f; 13a; Taube 2003b). As David Stuart (1992) has noted, Classic Maya jade earspools commonly appear as</page><page sequence="5">Taube: Flower Mountain 73 flowers. A striking trait of most such earspools is the large central hole, much like the orifice of a mouth, flower, or cave. Classic earspools are commonly depicted as breathing, either by the outwardly curving pair of volutes or by a serpent emerging from the center of the device (see ibid.: fig. 19a-c). In fact, the very common bar and bead projecting from the center of earspools probably refer to the breath essence of the object (see figs. 2c, 3b-d; Taube 2001 d). The Maya wind god Rather than eating actual food, the spirits consume the breath or aroma, whether of food, flowers, incense, or blood. Miguel Aguilera (pers. comm. 2000) has called my attention to a contemporary Yucatec belief concerning the very ancient ancestors, or hach uchben uchben Maya who, rather than toiling in the fields for maize, simply consumed the aroma of flowers. Breath or wind is not simply the food of gods and ancestors, but also constitutes their spiritual nature, compared to the perfume of flowers and incense (Taube 2001a:272). One deity in particular, the ancient Maya god of wind, embodied the breath spirit. I (Taube 1992b) initially compared Schellhas's God H with a Classic entity appearing as the head variant of the number three and the patron of the month Mak, and suggested that both represent the same being, the wind god (figs. 2-3). Both the Classic and Postclassic entities are handsome young men with long hair, a segmented, woven headband, and a prominent floral element on the brow. The headdress blossom commonly emits the pair of outwardly curving lines denoting the breath aroma of the flower (fig. 2b-c). The Classic god clearly relates to wind, and typically has a prominent ik' sign on his cheek or earspool. The head of this god, complete with the segmented headband and ik' sign earspool, serves as the day-name ik', or "wind," in Classic texts, including those of Palenque and Piedras Negras (fig. 5b). It is also noteworthy that the Postclassic codical God H can also appear with the //c7 sign on his cheek (fig. 4g-i). Clearly, God H and the Classic deity are the same being, the Maya god of breath and wind (Houston and Taube 2000:273). Figure 3. The relation of the Classic Maya wind god to music. a.

In a number of Mayan languages, the word for three, ox or ux, relates to terms for breath, wind, vapor, scent, and spirit (ibid.). The Yucatec word ox signifies both "three" and "wind or breath" (Barrera V?squez 1980:610-611). Similarly, in closely related Itza, 'ox means "three," and oox, "steam or vapor" (H?fling andTesuc?n 1997:488, 494). Whereas in most Mayan languages the word for three is ox, in Ch'orti, ux is used instead (Aulie and de Aulie 1978:126). For a number of highland Mayan languages, the root ux denotes both breath and spirit. Thus in Quiche, ux/'/ab signifies "breath, soul, smell," and ux?labixel "Holy Ghost, spirit" (Edmonson 1965:139). In colonial Cakchiquel uxla is the term for breath, with uxlar' meaning "spirit, grace of god, and scent" (Acu?a 1983:ccix). TheTzutuhil term uxlaa' signifies breath and aroma, such as of a flower (P?rez Mendoza and Hern?ndez Mendoza 1996:475), immediately recalling the many portrayals of breathing flowers in Classic Maya art. In Classic Maya texts, a common death verb describes the termination of a pair of elements, a floral form including the sak sign for "white," and the ik' wind sign as the breath spirit. One Palenque text directly substitutes the head of the wind god for the ik' glyph, denoting this floral being as the personification of the breath soul (fig. 2e). The white floral element also refers to this soul, as death skulls exhale both this device and ik' signs (see Houston and Taube 2000:fig. 4a-b). This death verb refers to the expiration of the breath soul, personified by the handsome wind god. Identified with flowers and the breath soul, the Maya wind deity is the god of music. Blossoms and wind signs commonly ornament Classic Maya rattles and other musical instruments (fig. 3). As with fire offerings, wind is the creative source and vehicle by which music is conveyed (Taube 2001a). Not only are "wind instruments" sounded by breath, but air and wind carry sound and music. One elaborately incised Early Classic vessel portrays music being played with a background of floating flowers and the celestial Bearded Dragon (see Hellmuth 1988:fig. 4.2). In the scene, the head of the wind god emerges from the jaws of the crocodilian world tree (fig. 3a). Along with the cheek markings and long hair, he has the diagnostic woven headband also found with the Classic Maya monkey scribes, probably a marker of courtly artisans. Another youthful figure with cheek markings shakes a pair of rattles at the far left of the scene (fig. 3b). The facial markings, the capping floral element tipped with long hair and the floral serpent diadem suggest that this deity is also the wind god. Classic Maya texts supply explicit evidence that the wind god was the god of music. On the carved bench from the House of the Bacabs at Copan, the wind god appears as the personified form of the number three shaking a rattle (fig. 3c). The Initial Series introductory glyph of the Palace Tablet at Palenque also portrays the wind god as a musician (fig. 3d). Appearing as the patron of the month Mak, the long-haired wind god displays ik' body markings and shakes a pair of rattles. A pair of carved bones from Tikal Burial 116 contains specific textual references to the wind god (figs. 2c, 3g). Trik (1963:15) describes these objects as "two long tubes with carved ends and beautifully incised columns of hieroglyphs, accented with the brilliant red of cinnabar." These tubes are simply the bone handles of a pair of now decomposed gourd rattles. A compound from one of the bone texts contains a rattle sign, essentially identical to the rattles held by the Early Classic wind god (fig. 3 b, g). Moreover, the carved ends of the bone handles are entirely comparable to examples appearing in Classic Maya art (fig. 3f). The Maya wind god and rain making A series of over twenty known Late Classic codex style vessels represent a mythic episode concerning the capture of the wind god (fig. 4; see Robicsek and Hales 1981:71-74; Kerr 1990:201, 217, 269; 1992:462; 1994:641). Portrayed in standing water, it features a youthful god and his tribute-bearing retinue captured by one or more warriors. A handsome man with long locks of hair, the young god usually wears a prominent flower in his brow, traits indicative of the wind god. The principal antagonist invariably has a large "Kaban curl" earth sign on or before his face or on his body, and typically wears the knotted pectoral of Chaak. The warrior probably constitutes an anthropomorphized version of the rain god. Along with wearing the spondylus earspools and headdress of the rain god, in several scenes he is epigraphically labeled as Chaak Xib, including two where he lacks the diagnostic shell earspools and headdress (see Kerr 1990:217, 269). In many of the capture scenes, the wind god, his assistants, or even the antagonists have widely open mouths (fig. 4a-b). Rather than denoting shouting, this mouth position indicates singing, and marks the title for singer, or k'ayom (fig. 4c, see Houston and Taube 2000).

Late Preclassic scene of Chaak fishing, note fish on feet and forearms, Izapa Stela 1 (drawing by Ayax Moreno, reproduced courtesy of the New World Archaeological Foundation). dates accompanying the scenes are significant. Although with varying coefficients, eight of the discernable thirteen dates appear with the day-name Ik', or wind. The remaining five dates all have the twentieth day name Ajaw, equivalent to the Central Mexican day-name Flower. Another Late Classic vase of markedly different style portrays a version of the same aquatic episode, again on an Ik' day (fig. 4d). In this scene, an anthropomorphic Chaak grasps the long hair of the wind god, who emerges from a fish. This scene clearly denotes fishing, with another fish held between the legs of the captor. Chaak is the preeminent fisherman; aside from the well known incised-bone fishing scenes from Tikal Burial 116, David Stuart (pers. com. 1986) notes that the Palenque Creation Tablet describes Chaak as a fisherman, or kayom. The Late Preclassic Izapa Stela 1 reveals fishing to be a rain-making act, with clouds and water falling from a fishing net and creel carried by Chaak (fig. 5d, see Taube 1995:95). The Classic "fish in hand" glyph is read tsak, a Mayan term meaning to fish as well as to conjure both clouds and wind in colonial Yucatec (fig. 5a). On Early Classic stelae from Tikal, Caraco, and Calakmul, rulers wear stylized fish on their wrists and ankles while holding the ceremonial bar used for conjuring gods and ancestors (fig. 5b). It is quite</page><page sequence="9">Taube: Flower Mountain 77 likely that many of the Early Classic jade plaques in the form of fish are the same items bound to the limbs of rulers (fig. 5c). With these fish limbs, the lords are much like the fishing Chaak on Izapa Stela 1, who has fish feet and forearms. While wearing these fish plaques, the Early Classic Maya kings are portrayed as fishermen who conjure gods and ancestral souls as their symbolic catch. The scenes of Chaak capturing the wind god and fishing concern the same natural process, the ascent of water and clouds into the sky. One text accompanying a wind god capture mentions that on this date, Chaak Xib enters the sky, or och chan (see Kerr 1990:21 7). The capture of the god of wind and music by Chaak is more an expression of rain making rather than any underlying antagonism between the two beings. One codex-style vessel even illustrates the captive as a conflation of Chaak and the wind god (see Kerr 1992:462). Moreover, on page 44c of the Codex Dresden, Chaak and a duck billed version of the wind god identified by Stuart (Stuart et al. 1999:44) raise a fishing net. An Early Classic version of the wind god waist-deep in water appears on a painted stucco vessel from Tikal (fig. 6a). Portrayed with long flowing hair and a breathing floral headband, the wind god faces the youthful diurnal sun god, who raises a serpent out the water with both hands. While gently lifting the serpent head with his right hand, the wind god appears to be singing, and his pose is notably similar to examples of the wind god appearing in the codex-style vessel scenes (fig. 4a-b). The large coil of the snake frames a prominent Ak'bal sign, signifying darkness, and clearly the snake and Ak'bal sign are versions of the Ak'bal snake jar commonly carried by Chaak?a symbol of dark, rain-laden clouds (fig. 6b). Polly Schaafsma (1999:184) notes that in Mesoamerica and the American Southwest, the rising of terrestrial water into the sky for rain often is symbolically expressed by raising water filled jars. The Tikal scene of the sun and wind gods raising the water-filled serpent represents a common and impressive natural event, the dawn rising of clouds of Figure 6.

Of course, as maize farmers largely dependent on seasonal rainfall for water, peoples of Mesoamerica and the Southwest are acutely aware of the process of evaporation. In a contemporary Mixtee creation account, rain originated from evaporating mist rising out of standing water (Monaghan 1995:205). Among the Zuni of New Mexico, the U'wannami rain makers rise in breath with their rain jars 1. This soft, breath-like wind is not to be confused with strong winds that can bring destruction to crops and people (Taube 2001a). Francesco Pellizzi (pers. comm. 2003) notes that among the contemporary Tzotzil, certain powerful winds are believed to "shut off the rains, often with a rainbow following to mark the termination of rain. The contemporary Yucatec Maya also consider rainbows as inauspicious signs denoting a lack of water: 'The rainbow {chel) is spoken of as 'the flatulence of the demons' {u ciz cizinob), because it is thought to arise out of dry wells {x-lah-ch'en), and these are, as it were, the ani of Metnal" (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934:206).</page><page sequence="10">78 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 7. Late Classic portrayals of symbolic rain with burning censers. a. Falling floral jewels near burning censer, detail of Naranjo vessel (after Kerr 2000:1003). b. Detail of dance performance with dancer, conch player, and individual kneeling before censer (after Kerr 1992:397). out of evaporating steam, essentially the same concept as the Early Classic Tikal scene (Stevenson 1904:21). As with the Maya metaphors of capturing the wind god and fishing, the Tikal vessel portrays the taking of water and rain into the sky (for exhalation of wind into sky and rain-making symbolism, see Taube 2001a, 2003b). The conjuring and celestial ascent of gods and ancestors In ancient Mesoamerica, music was an essential means of conjuring gods and other supernatural beings. As with floating incense, it was both the food and essence of the gods and ancestors. Evon Vogt (1969:403) notes that in contemporary Zinacanteco ritual, smoking incense, flowers (real or symbolic), and music provides the setting for contacting supernatural beings. In Classic Maya art, floating or falling flowers and jewels mark the heady atmosphere and place of honored spirits, the realm of Flower World. In these scenes, dancers, musical instruments, and burning censers are often present. One Late Classic vessel portrays a richly dressed figure with a burning offering and music dancing among falling rain (fig. 7b, for entire scene, see Kerr 1992:397). The accompanying text describes him as a "sacred wind lord," and it is likely that this scene portrays a wind-god impersonator, if not the wind deity himself. Although the vessel scene could be interpreted as a rain dance, the elements may well be versions of the falling flowers and jewels found in other scenes of fire offering, including a vessel from the region of Naranjo (fig. 7a). The censer is marked with the solar k'in sign, and in Classic texts, this device was read e/or elel, signifying "to burn," and appears in a verb referring to temple censing (see Stuart 1998:389-390). At Palenque, the Sarcophagus Lid of Pakal and the Temple of the Cross Tablet portray such censers below falling jewelry and flowers. Similar falling elements also appear in the other reliefs from the Temple of the Foliated Cross and the Temple of the Sun. In all three Cross Group reliefs, the ruler Kan B'alam faces his deceased father, Pakal, and it is likely that the falling elements mark these scenes as numinous moments of interaction between the living and the conjured deceased. A notably similar</page><page sequence="11">Taube: Flower Mountain 79 program appears on the recently excavated Early Classic Motmot marker from Copan, which portrays the second king of the Copan dynasty, K'inich Popol Hoi, facing his predecessor, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo,' in a quatrefoil cave surrounded by the rain of flowers and jewels. It is quite likely that this monument was created shortly after the death of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' (see Martin and Grube 2000:194). The precious rain of floral jewels also appears on the walls of Tikal Burial 48, the burial crypt of the Early Classic king, Siyaj Chan K'awiil (ibid.:36). It is quite likely that these floral motifs represent the celestial paradise of the deceased king, the ancient Maya version of Flower World. In an analysis of the supernatural realm of flowers, Hellmuth (1988) compared the Burial 48 ornaments to the aforementioned Early Classic vase featuring the wind god with music, flowers, and the great serpent. Although Hellmuth (ibid.) suggests an underworld setting for this event, the celestial serpent, precious birds, and flowers all suggest a bright, diurnal world. Near the center of the scene, there is the solar censer. In thematic content, the vase is quite like another incised vessel scene dominated by an undulating serpent with a background of floating beads and flowers (see Schele and Miller 1986:308). Near the base, a small figure sounds a conch, a musical wind instrument par excellence (for Maya conch wind symbolism, see Taube 2003b). The Maya vessel portrays the celestial serpent rising out of the underworld through a stepped cave opening delineating the form of the ik' wind sign. At the bottom of the cave, the earth crocodile exhales the burning serpent as well as a composite maize and moon deity riding in its coils. In addition, a disk with a crenelated rim emerges from the mouth of the bearded serpent. In both the Maya region and Central Mexico, such disks commonly represent solar mirrors (Taube 1992a:192-195). With the backgrounds of floating or falling floral jewels, both illustrated vessels concern the ritual symbolism of resurrection and celestial ascent, a process conveyed by serpents of breath and wind (for Classic Maya wind and serpent symbolism, see Taube 2003a). On Classic Maya monuments, royal ancestors commonly hover in the uppermost portions of scenes, referring to a celestial paradise rather than the dark underworld. Quite frequently, ancestors are portrayed as the male sun or female moon. The upper portion of Tikal Stela 31 portrays the Early Classic king Nun Yax Ayiin apotheosized as the sun god holding the Bearded Dragon, quite probably his means of celestial ascent (fig. 8a). The celebrated founder of the Copan dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo, is apotheosized as an avian sun god on the Early Classic building known as Rosalila (Agurcia 1997). Field research by Barbara Fash and I has established that a major sculpture from an overlying later building, Structure 10L-16, again depicts the founder as the sun god performing a war dance in a solar mirror shield (Taube, 2004). An Early Classic shell pectoral portrays an ancestor figure peering downward from a similar solar cartouche (fig. 8b). The pairs of breath volutes exhaled from each of the two small centipede heads on the rim indicate an aromatic place. Many Yaxchilan stelae portray ancestral couples paired in sky bands as the sun and moon (see T?te 1992, figs. 7, 22b, 22d, 33c, 46, 86, 88, 124, 130). At Palenque, solar medallions encircle the sun god flanked by a pair of ancestor figures and two inwardly facing birds, denoting the paradisal place of the sun and the exalted dead (fig. 12c). Flower Mountain The Early Classic vessel commonly referred to as the Death Vase represents the two common Classic Maya themes of rebirth and apotheosis: the resurrection of the maize god and the ascent of the sun into the sky (fig. 9; Taube 2001 b:270-271; 2003b:435). A basal band of standing water, a symbol of the underworld, link both sides of the vase. One vessel side depicts three personified trees growing atop a rotting corpse (fig. 9a). Both the central tree and the plant to the viewer's left have cacao pods on their trunks, and face one another with their fingers touching as a gesture of affection. It is likely that these figures constitute an ancestral couple, the maize god and his wife. The head of the lefthand figure is identical to the six female mourners flanking the dead maize god on the other side of the vessel (fig. 9b). With his cheek markings, long hair, and floral head elements, the foliated figure behind the central maize deity is apparently the wind god. The trees are backed by a stepped pyramid and still further back, a zoomorphic form also found on the opposite side of the vessel (fig. 9). Thanks to a brilliant epigraphic decipherment by David Stuart (1987) it is now known that this long-snouted creature represents a mountain, or witz in Mayan languages. The scene on the opposite side of the vessel portrays six maidens mourning the bundled corpse of the maize god. This tableau concerns the well-known Preclassic and Classic episode of young maidens dressing the</page><page sequence="12">80 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 8.

Coe 1989: 176-787; Freidel et al. 1993:92-93, Quenon and le Fort 1997). The mountain behind the lifeless maize god is marked by prominent flowers on the brow, and on close inspection, similar flowers with hair-like protrusions can be discerned on the mountain on the opposite side of the vase. A similar floral mountain appears in a Late Classic vessel scene portraying the dressing of the maize god with nubile young women waist deep in water (see Kerr 2000:994). To the right of the scene, the Classic period form of the Hero Twins Xbalanque and Hunahpu appear at a mountain displaying three witz heads, each with a flower protruding from the brow (fig. 12d). In Classic Maya art, particular mountains were commonly labeled by placing the name in the central brow region (Stuart and Houston 1994:figs. 96, 98). The Classic form of Hunahpu stands within the great open mouth of the principal witz, a cave passage linking the underworld interior of the mountain to the earth and heavens. Both the Early Classic Death Vase and the Late Classic vessel portray Flower Mountain, a place of resurrection and ascent out of the underworld. On the Death Vase, one of the dais legs supporting the dead maize god is marked by the death verb och b'ih, meaning "enters the road." The glyphic compound is composed of a rattlesnake tail, or och, and earspool read b'ih, meaning "road." Although this verb has been</page><page sequence="13">Taube: Flower Mountain 81 Figure 9.

A crenellated solar cartouche containing the face of the sun god rises directly above the bundled maize god and Flower Mountain (figs. 9a, 10a). Along with the smoking Ajaw brow element commonly found in Classic-period male parentage statements, the sun god is accompanied by a lunar crescent, recalling the aforementioned pairing of male sun and female moon ancestral couples at Yaxchilan. David Stuart (pers. comm. 2000) notes that for the solar cartouche appearing at the top of Yaxchilan Stela 3, the ancestor is labeled as Aj Jo' Janahb' Witz, or "He of 5 Flower Mountain," Janahb' being a term for a specific type of flower (fig. 8d). Two Late Classic lintels from El Chicozapote depict an ancestral pair as the sun and moon seated upon witz heads marked with prominent flowers on the brow (fig. 10b-c). Clearly enough, the Death Vase scene is a conflation of the El Chicozapote lintels, celestial ancestors atop Flower Mountain. Among the contemporary Tzutuhil Maya of Santiago Atitlan, there is the concept of Flowering Mountain Earth, the pivotal axis mundi supporting the stump of the ancestral maize tree, the "Father\Mother" (Carlsen and Prechtel 1991). Flower Mountain appears widely in ancient Maya art, and is both the dwelling place of ancestors and the means by which they and celestial gods ascend into the sky. An Early Classic vessel from Kaminaljuyu portrays the youthful sun in the maw of a snake exhaled out of Flower Mountain (fig. 10d). On the Early Classic Death Vase, Flower Mountain rises out of standing water, and as the axis mundi, this mountain is the point of contact</page><page sequence="14">82 RES 45 SPRING 2004 between the watery underworld and the sky. A Late Preclassic stucco facade from Uaxactun portrays Flower Mountain rising out of the aquatic, fish-filled underworld (fig. 11a). Flower Mountain also appears on the roughly contemporaneous Stela 4 from Abaj Takalik, where a pair of flower-marked mountain caves flank a pool of water out of which rises a flaming celestial serpent with the crenelated sun disc in its coils (fig. 11b). Carrying a probable god or ancestor in its mouth, the serpent rises out of an earspool, a Late Preclassic form of och b'ih (Taube 2003b:437). The Stela 4 scene is notably similar to a Late Classic Maya vase portraying Figure 10. Solar Imagery in relation to Flower Mountain. a. Solar sign with lunar crescent atop Flower Mountain (see fig. 9). b-c. Ancestor figures as sun and moon seated on Flower Mountain, El Chicozapote Lintels 1 and 2 (after Maler 1901-1903:plate 37) d.

The center of the scene portrays the axis mundi as a censer bowl and world tree atop a quatrefoil cave. Whereas the brow of one mountain is obscured, the other displays a prominent flower, identifying this place as Flower Mountain (fig. 12c). At Caracol, many monuments depict Flower Mountain as toponymie supports for rulers, including Stelae 4, 6, 11, 14, and Altar 12. Stela 4 portrays an apparent group of ancestors within the hill, here displaying the woven headband of the wind god with a central quatrefoil flower (see Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981:fig. 5). On Stela 14, several individuals sit on three apparent hearthstones before a Flower Mountain portrayed with pendant flowers at the sides, quite like the example from the aforementioned Death Vase (ibid.: fig. 14). Below the mountain scene, a figure sits in a chamber, possibly a burial crypt, presented in the form of the ik' wind sign. As the place of celestial ascent, Flower Mountain is closely related to the symbolism of royal tombs and their overlying pyramids. Mention has been made of the floating jewels and flowers painted on the walls of Tikal Burial 48. The structure that covered this tomb was ornamented with stucco masks of Flower Mountain, all displaying massive flowers on their brows (fig. 12b). In addition, the eastern wall Tomb 1 at Rio Azul features Flower Mountain with a series of flowers on its brow (fig. 12a). The other side of the east wall features the head of the sun god atop the crocodile earth (see Hellmuth 1987:plate 38). The placement of both Flower Mountain and sun god on the east wall of Rio Azul Tomb 1 indicates the journey of the tomb occupant to Flower Mountain and solar paradise. Examples of Flower Mountain abound in Terminal Classic architectural facades of the northern Maya lowlands (figs. 13, 14). Ch?nes, R?o Bec, and Puuc structures frequently portray stacked zoomorphic heads at the corners (fig. 13a, d). Although these long-snouted heads are widely identified as Chaak, Linda Schele (1998:484) notes that almost all examples lack such important Chaak traits as the crossed-band shell diadem and the spondylus earpieces. The Chaak identification primarily is based on the pendulous appearance of Chaak's nose in the Late Postclassic codices rather than its Terminal Classic form, which is generally short and muzzle-like (see Taube 1992b:figs. 5c-d, 8a). The Chaak identification largely derives from the early work of Eduard Seier (1917), when the chronological development of this being was poorly known. However, Figure 11.

Hero twins at cave of Flower Mountain, note blossoms of brows of three witz heads, detail of Late Classic vessel (after Kerr 2000:994). long-snouted heads are very similar to the stacked zoomorphic witz heads present at the corners of Copan Structure 10L-22 (see Fash 1991:fig. 78). In addition, aside from the Copan temple, witz heads are commonly in superimposed groupings in Classic Maya art, possibly alluding to mountains formed of discrete masses of projecting stone. For Structure 10L-22 and the temples of the northern lowlands, the concept of a "mountain house" corresponds well with the series of stony masks as well as the frequent doorways in the form of cave-like maws. Facades at the Ch?nes site of Xkichmook portray corner witz heads exhaling elaborate breath volutes out of the corners of their mouths (fig. 13b: see Gendrop 1983:fig. 94). In fact, Ch?nes and Rio Bee temple facades are filled with such breath volutes, which also emerge from breathing earspools and the mouths of the great zoomorphic doorways (fig. 13a, c-d). For the</page><page sequence="17">Taube: Flower Mountain 85 doorways, massive pairs of breath volutes commonly curl out from the corners of the mouth. Rather than simply being baroque-like ornamentation, such breath volutes have profound meaning, as they denote such temples as places infused with spiritual power and life. According to Linda Schele (1998:484), many of the zoomorphic doorways from the northern lowlands are "mountain monsters." Although most sculpture directly above the doorways has been destroyed by collapse, the Ch?nes Structure 1 atTabasque?o displays a four petal led blossom on the brow of the central serpent faced doorway, marking it as Flower Mountain (fig. 13d). Structures at Chich?n Itz? and Uxmal are covered with portrayals of Flower Mountain, which usually appear at the corners or as frontal mask panels (fig. 18a-d). Schele (1998:486) notes that a great many "long-nosed gods" appearing on buildings at Uxmal and Chich?n Itz? have flower headbands and often a central floral medallion, which she read as itz. According to Schele (ibid.) the brow blossom is identical to the medallion worn by the aged creator god, Itzamnaaj, with the zoomorphic heads portraying his avian counterpart, often referred to as itzam yeh or the Principal Bird Deity. However, in both Classic and Postclassic portrayals of Itzamnaaj, the medallion is marked with the Ak'bal sign denoting darkness, a trait lacking for the blossoms appearing on the Puuc facades (see Taube 1992b:fig. 12). In addition, the Uxmal and Chichen examples lack avian attributes, including wings, talons, or beaks. Thus, rather than having the sharply in-curving beak of the mythical bird, the masks have snouts with up-curving tips, a trait of the zoomorphic witz. Rather than portraying rain gods or mythic birds, the Uxmal and Chich?n Itz? facades are depictions of Flower Mountain. At Chich?n Itz?, Flower Mountain is not limited to mosaic facades but also appears above and below Figure 13. Portrayals of breath in Late Classic Ch?nes facades. a. Probable witz head with breathing earspool, Structure 5, Hormiguero (after Gendrop 1983:fig. 82a). b.

As in the case of the mosaic examples appearing on structures, the frontally facing witz heads have the segmental floral headband marking Flower Mountain. Whereas the witz heads from the Upper Temple of the Jaguar have short snouts with outwardly curving fangs, the examples from the Mercado are more anthropomorphic. However, the latter are supplied with prominent breath volutes, which emerge from the earspools as well as the mouth (fig. 15c). In both structures, the figures standing atop Flower Mountain are accompanied by floating jewels and other smoking or aromatic elements. According to Schele and Mathews (1998:229), these falling elements "identify the context as one filled with k'ulel, the sacredness that permeates the cosmos." These authors suggest that the standing figures may be engaged in a bloodletting ritual (ibid.). However, rather than being the supplicants, these figures may be the conjured dead. Wooden lintels from the Upper Temple of the Jaguar at Chich?n Itz? portray the floating jewels and the sun god within a solar disc, indicating that the place of this precious rain is the paradise of the sun (fig. 15a). Dressed inToltec military garb and accompanied by Central Mexican name glyphs, the figures may be heroic warriors in the celestial paradise of Flower Mountain. Flower Mountain in ancient Mesoamerica and the American Southwest TheToltec warriors atop Flower Mountain at Chich?n Itz? constitute a rich amalgamation of both Maya and Central Mexican traditions. Although the figures display Toltec weaponry and costume, they stand atop the Maya form of Flower Mountain, a witz head wearing a Figure 14. Flower Mountain in Puuc facades. a.

However, the concept of a floral paradise was present in Late Postclassic Central Mexico, and clearly related to the "flowery wars" of the Aztec. For the Aztec, souls of warriors slain in battle or by sacrifice became birds and butterflies drinking the nectar of flowers in the heavenly realm of the sun (see Sahag?n 1950-1982, bk. 3:49). Similarly, in neighboring Tlaxcala, souls of nobles became jewels, clouds, and precious birds, again evoking a celestial paradise (Mendieta 1980:170). John Bierhorst (1985:22) notes that Aztec kings were the preeminent warriors, and the frequent evocation of historic kings in the Cantares Mexicanos suggests that deceased Aztec rulers also went to the flower paradise. According to Bierhorst, the Cantares Mexicanos were "ghost songs" for conjuring the dead from their celestial afterworld. Although Bernard Ortiz de Montellano (1989:476) questions Bierhorst's interpretation of the flower, or xochitl, as a symbol for the conjured dead, this is entirely consistent with what we have seen for the Classic Maya as well as with the greater Flower World complex. Indeed, in a discussion of the god of music, Xochipilli, Laurette S?journ? (1976:146) notes the close relation of flowers to the soul in Central Mexican thought: As the bird, the butterfly, and the flower are symbols for one particular divinity, it is clear that the Lord of Flowers, Xochipilli, must be the personification of the soul. The first song of the Cantares Mexicanos provides the most detailed description of flower paradise, and refers to it as "mountain within" (ibid.:20). As with the Classic Maya, this mountain place is filled with floating flowers, music, and incense: A flower incense, flaming all around, spreads sky aroma, filled with sunshot mist, as I, the singer, in the gentle rain of flowers sing before the Ever Present, the Ever Near (ibid.:141). The description of this Aztec paradise is strikingly similar to the Classic Maya scenes of conjuring gods and revenants through music and incense. Whereas the art of the Classic Maya and Chich?n Itz? vividly portrays the precious rain of flowers, the Cantares Mexicanos offers textual descriptions of this numinous realm. Claudia Garcia-des Lauriers (pers. com. 2000) notes that the concept of a paradisal Flower Mountain continued in early colonial Christian N?huatl texts. In the Psalmodia Christiana texts compiled by Bernardino de Sahag?n, there is frequent reference to this place, commonly related to the paradise of Christ: There our lord's flowering mountain lies visible, lies giving off warmth, lies dawning. Its fragrance, its emanation, its</page><page sequence="20">88 RES 45 SPRING 2004 scent lies reaching far, lies spreading over the land (Burkhart 1992:99). Described as a mountain of the dawning sun, the sacred place of contact with the supernatural realm is delineated by aroma, such as from a flower or incense. In another song mentioning "flowering mountains" and the dawn, the wind carries the aroma of the flowers: "Let us sniff the wind that comes giving off fragrance, that comes giving off scent" (ibid.:96). As Burkhart (ibid.:99) notes, the Psalmodia Christiana songs share many traits with the Cantares Mexicanos, including the concept of a flowery solar paradise, although here with the sun compared to Christ. Given the antiquity of Flower Mountain among the Maya, it could be argued that the aforementioned Toltec warrior scenes at Chich?n Itz? and even the Aztec conceptions of the solar paradise are of Maya origin. However, the concepts of Flower Mountain and the celestial paradise were fully present at Early Classic Teotihuacan. A number of researchers have noted that the Aztec warrior cult of butterfly souls and the solar paradise derived from earlier Teotihuacan (S?journ? 1962:141-146; Berlo 1982:99, 1984; Taube 2000b). I (ibid.:308-39) have argued that the Teotihuacan "theater censers" concern the metamorphosis of the cocoon-like mortuary bundle into the butterfly soul through the transformational agency of fire. Brightly painted and covered with butterflies, flowers, and shining mica mirrors, these censers are wonderful encapsulations of Flower World. One Teotihuacan vessel portrays a butterfly figure in front of a hill with growing flowers, an explicit portrayal of Flower Mountain (fig. 16a). Supplied with wings and a central mirror over the torso, this butterfly warrior is identical to portrayals appearing on Teotihuacan-style censers from the region of Tiquisate, Guatemala. For one example, an almost identical butterfly figure is backed by a hill covered with four-petalled flowers (fig. 16b-c). Clearly enough, this censer is a three-dimensional form of the painted vessel, the warrior butterfly soul before Flower Mountain. An especially elaborate Tiquisate-style censer lid portrays figures seated atop a hill marked with four-petalled flowers and pellet appliques possibly [as elsewhere] alluding to beads or rain (see Mus?e Barbier Meuller 1992). In the exhibition catalog describing this mountain censer, it is described as "un v?ritable jardin du Paradis qu'habitent de petits personnages" (ibid.). The same pellet appliques as well as flowers and shells adorn other Tiquisate lids of hill form, including one example portraying a flying quetzal atop Flower Mountain. For both this and other examples, the smoke exit hole is a capping earspool, recalling Classic Maya depictions of breathing earspools and the och b'ih death expression (fig. 16d-e). The applique elements refer to the same rain of flowers and jewels portrayed in Classic Maya art and in Aztec poetry. One Teotihuacan mural portrays the jewel elements in the form of beads or pellets, flowers, birds, butterflies, mountains, and other elements floating or falling amid figures flanked by burning censers (see Langley 1993:fig. 8). At Teotihuacan, the largest known workshop for theater censers is in the northwest portion of the Ciudadela, a complex containing the Temple of Quetzalcoatl in its center (Saburo Sugiyama pers. comm. 1996, cited in Taube 2000b:311). Constructed circa A.D. 200, the facade of the Old Temple of Quetzalcoatl portrays two zoomorphic heads atop petalled disks (fig. 17a). Whereas one of the beings clearly portrays an early form of the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, the other head is quite distinct. Both Saburo Sugiyama (1992:220, 2000:131-132) and I (Taube 1992c:59-61, 2000:271) have identified the second head as a headdress. I (ibid.) interpret this element as a war helmet, consistent with the themes of militarism and sacrifice found in the dedicatory mass burials within the Old Temple (see Sugiyama 1992). Given its association with weaponry and warrior symbolism, I (Taube 1992b) have termed this being the War Serpent. Among the Classic Maya, it was known as waxaklahun u b'ah chan, or "eighteen its head/image snake" (Freidel et al. 1993:308). Along with a partially preserved text naming the War Serpent, Lintel 2 of Tikal Temple 1 also portrays the Late Classic ruler Jasaw Chan K'awiil richly dressed as this being. He sits on a stepped platform marked by a prominent War Serpent head, disks, a flowering barrel cactus, and a plant recently identified as a bul I rush by David Stuart (Stuart 2000). The upper surface of the three-tiered platform is also festooned with flowers (fig. 17c). In form, they are very similar to bouquets appearing on a roughly contemporary vase discovered in Burial 196 at Tikal (fig. 17b). David Stuart (pers. comm. 2002) notes that a number of the fragmentary bone texts from Burial 116 within Tikal Temple 1 contain epigraphic reference to the conjuring of the War Serpent at Flower Mountain, or nich te' witz (fig. 17d). The Old Temple of Quetzalcoatl was the Flower Mountain of the Teotihuacan world (Taube 2003b:435). Not only do the petalled disks ringing the War Serpent and Quetzalcoatl heads resemble flowers, mirrors, and earspools, but also the head of Quetzalcoatl emerges from a three dimensional petalled flower (fig. 17a). It is noteworthy</page><page sequence="21">Taube: Flower Mountain 89 Figure 16. The Flower Mountain of Early Classic Teotihuacan. a.

Like the Late Postclassic Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent of Teotihuacan also symbolized rain-bringing wind (Taube 2002). With their bodies passing through petalled rims, the feathered serpent facades on the Old Temple are massive portrayals of the Maya concept of och b'ih. Just as the Bearded Dragon was a Classic Maya conduit for conjuring gods and ancestors, the Teotihuacan Quetzalcoatl is portrayed conjuring the War Serpent at Flower Mountain. The shared presence of Flower Mountain at both Early Classic Teotihuacan and among the Late Preclassic and Classic Maya suggests that this concept is of great antiquity in Mesoamerica. I (Taube 2000a) have posited that during the Middle Formative period (900-500 B.c.), the Olmec disseminated an elaborate cult of maize and agricultural fertility, aspects of which continue in contemporary ritual and belief in the American Southwest. Identified with spring and summer rain and growth, flowers were a major component of this early agricultural symbolic complex. Mention has been made of the breath elements hovering before the faces of Olmec figures. In Olmec art, there are also portrayals of humans with butterfly wings, a creature widely identified with the celestial flowery paradise (fig. 18c). One Olmec jade portrays a masked personage amid floating or falling four-petalled flowers, recalling the Classic Maya scenes of conjuring with music and fire offerings (fig. 18a). Four-petalled flowers are common in Olmec iconography, and with their rounded outlines, closely resemble the quatrefoil cave form. A ceramic roller seal attributed to Chalcatzingo, Morelos, portrays such a flower with two raindrops, recalling the widespread Mesoamerican concept of raining flowers and jewels (fig. 18b). Chalcatzingo Monument 1 is a profile representation of a zoomorphic quatrefoil cave emitting breath volutes (fig. 12d). Appearing on two other Chalcatzingo monuments, this creature has been interpreted as a mountain cave by Jorge ?ngulo (1987), the sacred hill of Chalcatzingo. ?ngulo (ibid.rl 39?140) notes the presence of bromeliads growing at the corners of the cave, a plant found on Cerro Chalcatzingo. David Grove (1984:110) compares the profile cave zoomorph appearing in Monument 1 to the slightly later mountain toponyms appearing in MA II texts from Mound J at Monte Alban, Oaxaca (see Caso 1947). These Zapotee place names portray stepped mountains with stylized flowers in the corners, recalling the growing plants in the corners of the Monument 1 scene, a Middle Formative portrayal of Flower Mountain. The Monument 1 zoomorphic cave portrays a seated figure, probably a woman, with a rain-cloud skirt seated on the S-shaped cloud sign and carrying this same motif in her arms as a ceremonial bar (fig. 18d). The cave breathes out wind in symmetrical volutes, an elaborated version of the pair of symmetrical breath spirals commonly appearing in Classic Maya iconography (see fig. 1). Pairs of breath volutes also emerge from flowers in Olmec iconography (Taube 2001a:fig. 84). In addition, a pair of jade earspools excavated at La Venta portrays a circular element with breath volute exhaled from U-shaped maws (ibid.:figs. 81, 84). In one Chalcatzingo scene, raindrops and circular disks fall in a landscape surrounding Flower Mountain (fig. 18d). The disks are almost surely earspools, again alluding to the precious and sacred rain of conjuring appearing in later Classic and Postclassic Mesoamerica (for similar raining disks, see figs. 14d, 15b-c, 16e). Among the Hopi of the American Southwest, flowers relate to ancestors and the breath spirit. In one myth describing a journey to the underworld, deceased Hopi chiefs dwell in large blossoms, linking individuals of high status to sweet flowers (Voth 1905:112). In Hopi thought, both the food and essence of the dead is breath: they never eat the food, but only the odor or the soul of the food . . . And that is the reason why the clouds in which the dead are transformed are not heavy and can float in the air (ibid.:116). In Hopi mask portrayals of the Katsina cloud spirits, the breath soul frequently emerges from the mouth as a cotton cord tipped with a downy feather (see Taube 2001a:106). During the spring and summer dances, the Katsinam often carry flower effigies with the same breath cord hanging from the center of the flower, indicating it as a source of soul essence (ibid.:118-199, fig. 111). In addition, a number of Katsina masks have ears in the form of conical blossoms exhaling the breath plume, a concept strikingly similar to the breathing floral earspools of ancient Mesoamerica (see Wright 1973:151,165 166, 190, 192, 198; Roediger 1941 .-plates 9, 15). The nineteenth account of Alexander Stephen (Parsons 1936:333) describes the Hopi god of corn and germination, Muy'ingwa, at the nadir, the axis mundi of the underworld: Below sits M?'inyi?wu on Sihnchomo, Flower Mound. He wears a mask of clouds of these five colors, and before it flutter all the sacred birds and all the butterflies.</page><page sequence="23">Taube: Flower Mountain 91 In addition, Watson Smith (1952:230-231) identified ancient examples of Flower Mound in Pueblo IV Jeddito kiva murals at Awatovi and Kawaika-a. Along with growing flowers, these Pueblo IV portrayals of Flower Mound also depict maize, recalling not only the contemporary Hopi concepts of Muy'ingwa, but also the ancient Maya identification of the maize god with Flower Mountain. Although Flower Mound is a netherworld place, the ancestral Katsina rain spirits of Puebloan peoples rise out of the underworld into the sky as rain-bringing clouds, a cyclical process similar to the celestial ascent of royal ancestors among the Classic Maya (see Bunzel 1932:843-844; Parsons 1939:170 174). Hill (1992:129) notes that one term for the Hopi afterworld is "flowery land," a phrase that contains the root "shining forth." Conclusions In ancient Maya thought, people were profoundly linked to the surrounding world to such a degree that even aspects of the human soul related to specific Figure 1 7.

Whereas the unruly way soul was of the forest and the underworld, the breath spirit corresponded to the cultivated garden and a celestial paradise of flowers and beautiful birds. This Classic Maya realm constitutes a form of the Flower World identified by Hill (1992). For the ancient Maya, this region was closely related to Flower Mountain, a place of gods, ancestors, and celestial ascent. Two deities in particular were identified with Flower Mountain, the maize and sun gods. Quite clearly, this relates to their widespread use as metaphors for human death and rebirth, the sun god being reborn at dawn on a daily basis and the corn deity each year in the cycle of the planting and maturation of growing maize. As loci for conjuring gods and ancestors through fire offerings and music, Classic Maya temple pyramids were "flower mountains." Along with Flower Mountain, an important component of the Flower World complex is the concept of the breath soul, with flowers and their aroma commonly symbolizing this life force. In recent studies of ancient Maya ritual and belief, there has been a tendency to focus on darker aspects of Classic Maya religion, such as bloody offerings, the underworld realm of Xibalba, and the frequently grotesque way characters. However, as in the case of ancient Maya art, there was also a major orientation toward beings of life and beauty, such as the deities of maize and wind. Simply put, the cult of life is a cult of beauty, with symbols of the breath spirit appearing in the form of flowers, shining jewels, and precious plumes. The personification of the breath of life, the handsome wind god was closely identified with sweet aroma and music as well as flowers, ethereal qualities of breath soul. Although fleeting and immaterial, music</page><page sequence="25">Taube: Flower Mountain 93 and incense served as means of returning at least temporarily to the ancient realm of the gods and ancestors. Although dark Xibalba figures prominently in Classic Maya thought, there was also a strong orientation towards a solar celestial paradise, a shining place of flowers and beauty rather than stench and decay. Rather than being enjoyed by all deceased, this realm was probably limited to special individuals, such as nobility, who are widely identified with the regal sun. In addition, the Maya sun god was identified with war, suggesting that like the Aztec, the Maya solar paradise may have also been a realm for valiant warriors. Among the Classic Maya and other peoples of ancient Mesoamerica, the concept of a flowering mountain was closely related to the east and the celestial paradise of the sun. Aside from being a place of solar ascent, this mountain was also a means by which rain-making moisture entered the sky. The life-giving forces of the sun and rain are by no means opposed in Mesoamerica; the spring and summer rains as well as the sun come from the east. Just as the diurnal sun and rain descend below the earth, Flower Mountain was also related to the watery underworld, and linked the three realms of underworld, earth, and sky. The pivotal world axis, Flower Mountain was both the home of gods and honored ancestors, and the means of supernatural ascent into the heavens. SOURCES CITED Acu?a, Ren?
