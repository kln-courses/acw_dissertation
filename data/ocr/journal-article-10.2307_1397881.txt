<plain_text><page sequence="1">WVilliam J. Duiker The aesthetics philosophy of Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei Philosophy and politics are not often bedfellows. The political life is not generally conducive to reflection, and in normal times public figures have neither the time nor the inclination to meditate on abstract philosophical problems. Human society, however, depends on, for its survival and cohesion, the existence of a set of common philosophical assumptions about the nature of man and the universe; and when that vision is shattered, the stability of the political culture is threatened. In such times, men who are normally pre- occupied with the solution of practical problems will turn to philosophy in an attempt to construct a new intellectual basis for a common social identity. Such a period was the early twentieth century in China. By the last years of the Manchu dynasty it was becoming increasingly evident to many Chinese intellectuals that the days of Confucian China were numbered. Half a century of increasing contact with the West had not only resulted in a growing threat to the political and territorial integrity of China but had also demonstrated the inability of the traditional order in general to meet the challenge from abroad. Not only were Confucian social and political institutions seen as outmoded and inappropriate to China's changing needs, but the entire corpus of Confucian philosophy, for long the intellectual basis of Chinese civilization, suddenly seemed primitive and irrelevant. As the new century dawned, progressive intellectuals were openly speculating that Confucian philosophy had outlived its usefulness. Among the numerous Chinese intellectuals who turned to Western philoso- phy in the hope of finding solutions to the problems of social change in China, one of the more interesting was the educator and moral philosopher, Ts'ai Yuan-p'eia (1868-1940). Ts'ai was not a professional philosopher, and he is probably better known today as an educator and a prominent member of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang than for his philosophical ideas. Yet Ts'ai, like many of his contemporaries, came to feel that a new perception of reality was the key to the building of a better China, and over a long and active life, he made a concerted attempt to formulate a philosophical system which could serve as the basis for the creation of a new society. Born in 1868 of a merchant family in Chekiang province, Ts'ai was gifted with unusual academic ability, and after successfully hurdling the traditional obstacles in the examination system embarked on a promising career as a government bureaucrat in Peking. But like many of his contemporaries, Ts'ai was disillusioned by the events of the 1890s, and after the failure of the 1898 reform movement he went to Shanghai, where he joined the fledgling revolu- tionary movement and taught in several of the newly created modern schools there. In 1906, disgruntled at the lack of success achieved by the radicals and now convinced that education was the only true path to the revival of China, William J. Duiker is Assistant Professor of History at Pennsylvania State University.</page><page sequence="2">386 Duiker Ts'ai left China to study for a university degree in Europe. Four years of study in Germany gave him not only an increased knowledge of Western civilization and a degree from the University of Leipzig, but also provided him with a comprehensive world-view on which to base a philosophy for the total reform of Chinese society. The Philosophical Roots of Reform. Like many of his contemporaries, Ts'ai was eclectic in his search for solutions to China's problems and relied less on philosophical originality than on an ability to select those ideas which could harmonize with the best values of traditional Chinese civilization, a classical example of the attempt to synthesize the finest values of East and West as described by Joseph Levenson.' He had acquired a firm appreciation of Confucian ethics in his boyhood, and he grew to maturity with a staunch belief in the ultimate goodness and rationality of man, in the concept of a moral universe, and in the conviction that the "good man" accepted the dual obliga- tion of self-cultivation and service to society. In his Confucian studies he had never attached himself to a particular school, but from an early age he showed a tendency to take Confucian ethical maxims seriously.2 Although his gradual exposure to Western thought would ultimately persuade him to abandon his belief in many aspects of Confucian thought, Ts'ai's cast of mind evoked that of the old master, and the philosophical assumptions absorbed during his youth remained to form the basis of his mature world-view. Ts'ai thus came to Western thought with an innate optimism about the rationality of man and with a distinct ethical bent. He had come to feel that a substantial infusion of Western ideas and institutions was required to guarantee the survival of China in the modern world. At the same time he was distrustful of the consequences of an overreliance on the powers of science and on the material aspects of human progress which dominated the thoughts of many of his colleagues. Though an evolutionist, he was also instinctively repelled by the social Darwinist vision of warring states, a worldwide struggle for survival of the fittest, and he coveted the hope that relations among societies, as among men, could be established on a basis of harmony rather than on struggle.8 In 1 Confucian China and Its Modern Fate: The Problem of Intellectual Continuity (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1958). See especially pp. 110-114. For a discussion of the Confucian aspects of Ts'ai's thought, see my current article, "Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei and the Confucian Heritage," Modern Asian Studies 5, no. 3 (Jul., 1971): 207-226. 2 He reserved his greatest admiration for an obscure group of Confucian scholars who had organized a Shao-hsing Study Society (Shao-hsing Chih-hsueh Huim), and whose stated aim was the elimination of the three Great Evils of poverty, sickness, and evil on earth. 3 Here, of course, he differed from many of his more skeptical contemporaries, who adjusted rapidly to the demands of a social Darwinist universe. This phenomenon has been well documented in recent writings on modern China. See, in particular, Benjamin Schwartz' analytical treatment of Yen Fu's devotion to Chinese wealth and power in In Search of Wealth and Power: Yen Fu and the West (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1964), passim.</page><page sequence="3">387 essence, his sojourn in Europe became a quest for an ethical and spiritual underpinning to the doctrine of progress, which would combat the trend toward materialism and the preoccupation with national power in the Chinese pro- gressive movement. There were those in the West, too, who were combating the brutal aspects of social Darwinism. Ts'ai was immediately attracted to the thought of the anarchist prince, Peter Kropotkin, whose philosophy of Mutual Aid was based on the hypothesis that the survival of living species was based on cooperation, not on competition. But Kropotkin's theory, based on a mechanical explanation of the universe, was insufficient in itself. Whereas many Chinese progressive thinkers tended to a philosophical materialism, a belief in the omnipotence of science in solving all human problems and all questions relating to the mys- teries of the universe, Ts'ai was determined to find not only goodness in man and solutions to social problems, but meaning and purpose to human existence and a spiritual core to the universe. It was the philosophy of Immanuel Kant that provided Ts'ai with the struc- ture on which to base his program of social reform. While in Germany, he had become acquainted with the thought of the contemporary neo-Kantian philoso- pher Friedrich Paulsen.4 Paulsen represented a trend in German philosophy around the turn of the century against two conflicting views then current in European thought, the increasing belief in atomistic materialism in scientific circles, resulting in a growing acceptance of the mechanical theory as the ultimate explanation of reality, and speculative philosophy, which accepted science, but then found reality in a deductive world of its own. Paulsen attempted to create a system which would not only accept the paramount role of science in explaining natural events in the material world, but also would find a place for the existence of a transcendent moral force in the universe. He accepted the Kantian hypothesis that behind the physical or phenomenal world there lies the absolute reality of the noumenal, or intelligible world. Yet, while Paulsen followed Kant in admitting that man could not attain an absolute knowledge of reality, he contended that faith and logic dictated the conclusion that there is an ultimate monistic unity to the universe, based on the harmony of all things in a pantheistic all-one. This all-one is not a tran- scendent anthropomorphic being, but is a law of nature, a world-soul, and the source of all individual souls and wills in the universe.5 Paulsen admitted that pantheism was not subject to scientific verification, but he claimed to 4 He had been introduced to Kantian philosophy through a Japanese translation of the Neo-Kantian Kulpe's Introduction to Philosophy. Ts'ai was so impressed that he trans- lated the work into Chinese. The work is available in Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei Hsien-sheng Ch'iian- chin [The Complete Works of Mr. Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei] (Taipei: Commercial Press, 1968) (hereafter cited as CC). 5 Paulsen's cosmology is found in his Introduction to Philosophy, trans. Frank Thilly (New York: Henry Holt, 1895).</page><page sequence="4">388 Duiker discern an essential unity in all cosmological movements and inferred that this was the "reflection of an inner harmony, the manifestation of the unified inner life of a spiritual all-one."6 Discussing psychical life, Paulsen divided the soul into will and understand- ing. All living matter, even beyond organic matter, possesses a soul life, limited in primitive forms of life to blind volition. In more advanced beings, it gradually becomes more self-conscious, until true intelligence, or understanding, appears in human beings. Although individual wills cannot attain a total knowledge of the real world, they can, by understanding the essential oneness of nature, obtain a harmony of the myriad individual wills in the universal will of the pantheistic all-one. The world thus does have a design and moral purpose, not provided by an outside anthropomorphic force, such as is posited in Christianity, but by the interaction of all individual wills united in the universal will. Paulsen's philosophy naturally placed heavy reliance on morality. Having been exposed to Darwinist historico-genetic theory, which showed the connec- tion of human behavior with the evolution of society, Ts'ai could not accept the formalistic ethics that had been traditional in Christian Europe and had been restated by Kant in philosophical dress. At the same time he rejected the hedonistic implications of the nineteenth-century utilitarian pleasure-pain hypothesis. To Paulsen, a value need not measure only immediate pleasure and gratification of the senses to be utilitarian. The highest value and highest pleasure for mankind, and the best measure of the value of a given standard of behavior, is man's self-realization, or energism, the satisfaction of his spiritual, and not merely bodily, needs. This ethic of self-realization, which stresses man's innate sense of obligation to furthering the survival and develop- ment of life through a realization of his own individual faculties, provided mankind with the inner moral force necessary to strive for a transcendence of the phenomenal world to a unity with the all-one in the noumenal world. It also replaced the a priori standards of orthodox Christian morality and permitted a reconciliation of ethics with evolutionary theory. Paulsen's philosophy was undoubtedly congenial to Ts'ai for several reasons. Ts'ai's own character resembled the portrait of Paulsen given by William James: "the temper of his mind is essentially ethical, and philosophy for him is nothing if it does not connect itself with active human ideals."' Paulsen's hypothesis of a world soul, which in Ts'ai's interpretation found its manifesta- tion in all cultures, the Jehovah of the Jews, the Buddha of Asia, the World Spirit of Hegel, and in the mysterious deities of primitive animism, appealed to the Chinese reformer's need for a primary moral force in the universe. 6 Ibid., p. 217. 7 bid., iii.</page><page sequence="5">389 In its recognition of the paramount position of science in the interpretation of natural laws and its view of people having a life aim linked to the historical life of a people and of humanity in general, Paulsen's thought also found a ready response in Ts'ai's own views. Here was food for hope, for reform, for progress, and for man's duty to society. Finally, Paulsen, like Confucius, saw man's duty both to cultivate himself and to serve society. It is not surpris- ing that the influence of Paulsen on Ts'ai's thought was lasting. Ts'ai accepted Paulsen's pantheistic monism as the basis for his own philos- ophical world-view, and on his return to China in 1912 he attempted to popularize monistic pantheism as a new world-view for the Chinese nation.8 Like Paulsen, he admitted that idealistic pantheism was only a theory, but contended that it had the fewest weaknesses of all cosmological theories in existence. For those questions which science cannot answer, he said, each man must find his own solution in religion or philosophy. Ts'ai found his in Paulsen. Religion and Aesthetics. Since Ts'ai's views on the nature of reality were essentially no more than a reflection of the philosophical ideas he was able to pick up in Europe, they are of little interest to us in themselves. What is more distinctive is the way he attempted to link the spiritual world to the world of man, the application of his philosophical views to his reformist impulse. Paulsen had gone to considerable lengths to justify belief in the existence of a moral universe-a world of harmony and goodness-rather than the harsh world posited by social Darwinism, and he had concluded that Christianity could be the instrument to move mankind toward his goal. Here Ts'ai differed from his German mentor, for unlike Paulsen, he did not see organized religion as a means to develop man's sense of brotherly love and the spiritual sense. Indeed, Ts'ai, in his years in Europe, had developed an aversion to religion, and evidently Christianity in particular; and he maintained that religion was a divisive force in society, inciting man to build walls of local prejudice and superstition and discouraging him from the unfettered search for knowledge.9 In his ideal world of the future, there was no place for organized religion. 8 Ts'ai never claimed that most of his own philosophical ideas were original. The major sources for his own philosophical thought are in an article, "Shih-chieh-kuan yu Jen- sheng-kuan" [World View and Life View], Tung-fang Tsa-chiho [Eastern Miscellany], (hereafter cited as "Shih-chieh-kuan,"), and a short primer on philosophy entitled Che- hsueh Ta-kang [Outline of Philosophy] (Taipei: Commercial Press, 1916). The latter was apparently a source for what little knowledge many Chinese students of the May Fourth period possessed about Western philosophy. Both works are in CC. 9"Tu-wei Po-shih liu-shih sheng-jih wan-ts'an-hui yen-shwo-ts'e" [A Speech Given at the Evening Banquet on the Occasion of the Sixtieth Birthday of Doctor Dewey], CC, p. 782. Ts'ai was evidently influenced by Comte in his approach to religion and elaborated a theory that religion was a product of the primitive stage of man's evolution, when it</page><page sequence="6">390 Duiker In his attempt to free man from man's traditional dependence on religion, Ts'ai placed primary reliance on education. For if traditional man saw religion as the instrument to teach brotherly love and provide knowledge of the natural world, Ts'ai conceived of education as fulfilling analogous goals. The ultimate goal of human society is to transcend the phenomenal world to attain harmony with the universal will in the noumenal world, "to combine all beings in a harmonious whole where mutual differences have disappeared."10 And because the noumenal world is not located beyond the material world but is within it, the key to achieving this spiritual transformation must be found in improving the conditions of human life on earth. Through the advancement of knowledge, man could eliminate ignorance, prejudice, poverty, and disease. Knowledge of other cultures could increase human sympathy and understanding, and help develop man's comprehension of the all encompassing oneness of all living things. But increased knowledge, by itself, would not suffice to end human misery and conflict. Man must learn to cease thinking in terms of self-benefit; he must develop a disinterested, limitless world-outlook filled with a love of all living things. Unwilling to give religion a role in promoting human brother- hood, Ts'ai turned to aesthetics. Ts'ai's use of aesthetics as a means of transcending materialism is remin- iscent of the classical Confucian emphasis on music as a means to cultivate the superior man. More influential, however, in forming Ts'ai's views was Kantian philosophy, which itself had stressed the universal nature of the appreciation of beauty and its ability to provide a feeling of emotional detach- ment. Through his study in Germany, Ts'ai came to feel that aesthetics could be the connecting link between the noumenal and the phenomenal world, that where scientific knowledge could dispel the obstacles to harmony in the phe- nomenal world, art could help to describe the nature of the real world and raise its understanding in human society.1l In the appreciation of beauty the emotions of the phenomenal world-love and hate, sadness and joy-are transferred to the object of contemplation, and only an appreciation of beauty remains. Ts'ai used the example of a volcanic eruption, which inspires awe and fear in real life, but evokes only an emotionally detached feeling of beauty in a painting.12 Because the appreciation of beauty is universal and does not suffer from the distinction between the self and the non-self, it is able arose to satisfy the three basic aspects of the human character-the intellect, the will, and the emotions. Eventually, in Ts'ai's view, man learns that religion is not necessary to his intellectual and moral development and that beauty can be expressed in secular terms. At that point, religion would become a useless relic of history. 10Ts'ai, "Shih-chieh-kuan," CC, pp. 459-460. lIbid., p. 461. 12 Ts'ai, "Tui-yii chiao-yii fang-chen chih i-chien" [My Opinions on the Aims of Educa- tion], CC, p. 704 (hereafter cited as "Tui-yii chiao-yii").</page><page sequence="7">391 to subdue the desire to possess, which is characteristic of behavior in the material world. Aesthetic education is thus the best means for overcoming the psychological obstacles to reaching the noumenal world. The appreciation of beauty by mankind, having reduced prejudice and greed and ignorance and superstition, could transform the myriad things of the world (wan wub) into one harmonious family (i-tic). Ethics for a New Age. Ts'ai's philosophy placed a premium on individual action and self-cultivation, on an unfettered search for individual self-realiza- tion and commitment to social progress by all the individuals in society. Man's spiritual progress would necessarily be directly dependent on the action of the individual human will. In light of this, it is not surprising that at the center of his concern as an educator was the matter of ethics. Like Confucius, Ts'ai saw ethics as a voluntary replacement for law, self-discipline, and self- betterment for governmental regulation and control. The success of any practical philosophy of life involving a recognition of the free will of man would depend on the moral and intellectual level of man himself, and this would be true particularly in the case of Ts'ai's own world-view, in which the elevation of the moral qualities of humanity played such a paramount role. Ts'ai's approach to ethics outlines his distinctiveness in the Chinese nation- alist movement. Under the pervasive influence of social Darwinism, many Chinese modernizers chafed at the localism and familism, at the lack of national consciousness in the Chinese character. Ts'ai could only partly agree with this judgment. Many reformers, in their haste to strengthen the Chinese nation, were not anxious to free the individual from his obligation to serve the community. Indeed, many agreed with Liang Ch'i-ch'ao who had called specifically, not for individualism, but for group freedom, a Hegelian belief that true freedom lies in subordination of the individual to the state. Ts'ai was not anxious to free the individual from all obligations to serve society, but he could not place primary loyalty in the concept of the nation-state, as Liang had done. For to Ts'ai the nation was only a transitional stage to the international- ism of the Great Unity. Ts'ai was thus attempting the difficult task of affirming man's freedom while at the same time asserting his moral obligation to the community. It was in Paulsen's ethic of self-realization that Ts'ai found a vehicle for the expression of his ideas. He agreed with Paulsen in rejecting the implica- tions of hedonistic (li chid) utilitarianism, which stressed man's basic drives for personal happiness, prosperity, long life, and power. Such motives would hardly conform to his belief in the innate oneness of all living things. In an article written in 1912, he directly attacked the Chinese advocates of national wealth and power, citing the fact that parents always plan for the happiness and well-being of their children and grandchildren, even at their own expense.</page><page sequence="8">392 Duiker The concern of mankind is not limited to the family, since men are also willing to sacrifice themselves for national survival. But even nationalism is a limiting concept: Those who misread evolution say that the main goal of mankind is simply the survival of the self and the race, and therefore promote the idea that might makes right is the highest morality.... But if you make racial survival the highest aim, then the greatest virtue must necessarily be maintenance of the purity of the race. But pure races which prohibit intermarriage are seldom prosperous, while the great civilizations of ancient and modern times have always been racially mixed. ... So what kind of an aim is that ?13 True self-realization lies in furthering the happiness and progress of all humanity. Since man must die, and nations must inevitably decay, "if all the people of a nation pass from generation to generation a goal of life happiness which is extinguishable by death, then what is the value of man on earth? If this is the meaning of life, . . . then what is the meaning of sacrifice to achieve human-heartedness (jene), of the sacrifice of one's life for righteousness (it), of sacrifice of the self for humanity ?"14 Without such selflessness, he concluded, men would have no adventurous spirit and would not attempt long-term plan- ning. All activity would simply be directed at immediate personal benefit. Man, to satisfy his need for self-realization, must inevitably have a goal that transcends his own private and racial interests. An ethic of pure altruism could hardly appeal to a China struggling to sur- vive in a hostile environment, and Ts'ai conceded that pure selflessness, while admirable in theory, could not be realized in the contemporary world. In self- realization, man compromises his desire for individual happiness with the broader needs of humanity, and the former has "accessory value." When a conflict between the two arises, then man must be willing to sacrifice his own interests. Where his contemporary Yen Fu had contended that human society must be built on a recognition that man will always follow his "enlightened self-interest," Ts'ai maintained that man can, and should, rise above his own needs, and that the good society could only be built on that assumption.15 Through self-realization, all the individual wills in the world would eventually be expanded into a common will, to achieve happiness in the material world and to transcend the cares of the material world by a true understanding of the nature of the real world, a true harmony (Ta T'ungg) in the spiritual all-one. Energism became a basic element in Ts'ai's reform philosophy throughout his public life. Like the famous Victorian Samuel Smiles, he even published a 3 Ts'ai, "Shih-chieh-kuan," CC, pp. 461-462. 14Ts'ai, "Tui-yii chiao-yii," CC, p. 454. 15A good discussion of this is found in Schwartz, In Search of Wealth and Power, pp. 103-112.</page><page sequence="9">393 book of moral platitudes to provide a spiritual uplift for the common man. The titles are indicative of the nature of the morality: "Sacrifice yourself for the group," "Pay attention to public health," "Exert effort for the public benefit," "Do not do unto others as you would not have them do unto you," "Judge yourself severely and others lightly," "Love animals," and so forth.l6 Ts'ai's thin volume did not have an influence on China comparable to his English counterpart's on England, but it was fairly widely distributed among Chinese studying and working in Europe during the First World War. The emphasis was clear: Man had an obligation to serve society, to serve the future rather than the present, to search for spiritual pleasure rather than bodily enjoyment. And this obligation must come willingly from within the heart of man. Such hypotheses, of course, would be of little use if mankind lived in a social Darwinist world of sheer survival of the fittest. And the whole structure demanded acceptance of Ts'ai's basic premises, of monistic pantheism, of Mutual Aid, of the perfectibility of man. Such hypotheses, as Ts'ai himself admitted, ultimately must be based on will, since there can be no final knowl- edge of reality. It was his gamble that there was a rational and ethical order to the universe; it was not only logical, it was necessary to satisfy the spiritual urge of mankind. If you are going to make wishes, make them big. Proposals for Educational Reform. More than most, Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei was to be given an opportunity to put his ideas into a practical form. In China, in Octo- ber 1911, the Manchu dynasty was overthrown and a new republic was pro- claimed. Shortly thereafter, Ts'ai received an invitation from provisional president Sun Yat-sen to become the first minister of education in the new republican cabinet. Ts'ai accepted and must have been overjoyed at the pros- pect, for as head of the educational system he would have an unparalleled opportunity to initiate major changes in Chinese education, and thus preside over the remolding of the Chinese character. Ts'ai was not to be the first to attempt to revise China's traditional educational system, of course. Discontent with the existing system had become a common denominator of virtually all progressive elements in China by the early years of the twentieth century, and the Manchu court, although initially opposed to any basic transformation of the traditional system had ultimately acquiesced in a series of reforms providing for changes in administration and content. Most significantly, the keystone of the old structure, the civil service examination system, was abolished in 1905. But although the old dynasty had made belated attempts to adjust Chinese education to halt the rapid deterioration of China's internal condition, the system inherited by the new republic was still far from adequate in the minds of many modernizers. It still reflected basic Confucian ethical values, and its emphasis remained on the subordination of the individual to the emperor and 16 These essays can be found in CC, pp. 190-220.</page><page sequence="10">394 Duiker his government. It was this deficiency that Ts'ai's own reform proposals were designed to correct. The new minister wasted no time in setting his proposals before the public. In an article published in the February 1912 Chiao-yii Tsa-chihh [Educational Review] he presented the philosophical ideas would would underlie his pro- posals for the reform of Chinese education.17 Because the ideas encompassed in this article became the basis for his reform proposals and because they symbolize his approach to educational reform for the rest of his life, it is worthwhile to examine them in some detail. Ts'ai made clear in his article that at the heart of his program would be a new philosophy of education. As he explained it, the goals of education under the empire were essentially political: to inculcate in the student a respect for authority, loyalty to the dynasty, and obedience to the principles of Confucius. In such a system, the needs of the individual were subordinated to the require- ments of the government and the ruling oligarchy. In a republic, on the other hand, education should serve the needs of the individual and the society as a whole. It should service not only political needs but also the spiritual as well as material happiness of the citizens of the state. Such a concept of education contrasted not only with the traditional system but also with the views of many prominent members of the new government who continued to see education as an instrument for serving the immediate political aims of the state. He therefore attempted to devise a system which would assuage the potential resistance by his colleagues, while at the same time furthering his own goals. He divided his program into two parts: that which would serve the political aim of strengthening society and that which would transcend politics and educate China's youth in an understanding of internationalism. Ts'ai foresaw three ways in which education might legitimately be subordi- nated to national requirements-national military education, utilitarian educa- tion, and ethical education. He conceded that in the present state of the world, education must necessarily contribute to the preservation and development of the state. Although not generally sympathetic to military interests, he admitted there were valid reasons for keeping military education in republican China, not only for national defense, but also to prevent the military establishment from becoming a separate and powerful class. The second determinant of national strength was the level of national re- sources and human talent. Utilitarian education would be directed at raising the material and technological level of the nation to further national prosperity and strengthen the national economy. Ts'ai, committed to the belief that material and spiritual progress were compatible, had no objection to including this aspect in his program. The third quality, ethical education, would be 17 Ts'ai, "Tui-yii chiao-yfi," CC, pp. 452-459.</page><page sequence="11">395 directed at providing a moral basis for society, inculcating in every citizen the moral standards necessary to prevent internal oppression and exploitation as well as to maintain obedience to the law. Here, however, Ts'ai rejected the traditional ethical basis of Chinese society, the Confucian five relationships (enjoining loyalty and obedience by minister to king, son to father, younger to older brother, wife to husband, and friend to friend) and suggested that republican ethics should be based on the French revolutionary concept of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The above three points were concerned with improving the material condi- tions in Chinese society. They were patently designed to placate those members of the new government who were more concerned with national survival than with visions of a future utopia. By themselves they were hardly innovative: except for the replacement of the five relationships with the French revolu- tionary slogan, they reflected the reforms in education that had already been implemented in the later years of the old dynasty. The heart of Ts'ai's program, however, was the section on transcendental education, and this was bound to arouse controversy. Education, he asserted in his article, must be directed at more than achieving "the greatest material happiness for the greatest number." Man requires the satisfaction of his spiri- tual as well as his material needs. Education thus must have a broader aim, to assist humanity to comprehend the real world beyond the phenomenal world. Ts'ai's program for transcendental education was comprised of two aspects, world-outlook education and aesthetic education. The aim of world-outlook education was to acquaint the student with the religions, philosophies, and cultures of all human societies in order to demonstrate the essential unity of all mankind, and thus reduce the localism and superstition characteristic of the Chinese. Aesthetic education would help to cultivate the love of beauty which could best help to eliminate greed and prejudice, the obstacles to harmony in the material world. Ts'ai's program would be a heady draft for the new republic to swallow, and after issuing temporary orders calling for "republicanized" textbooks and forbidding education in the Classics in elementary schools, he convened an Emergency Educational Conference of educators from all sections of the coun- try in July 1912 in an attempt to round up support for his ideas. In a speech opening the conference, he attempted to explain his new program and urged Chinese educators not to be afraid to strike out on a new path. While placing emphasis on the role of education in unifying the nation, he stressed in par- ticular the need to decentralize the school system to achieve maximum local autonomy, and also emphasized the need to ensure that all Chinese received equal educational opportunities.l8 18Ts'ai, "Tui chiao-yii tsung-chih-an chih shwo-ming" [An Explanation of the Educa- tional Program], CC, pp. 1043-1044.</page><page sequence="12">396 Duiker Opposition to Ts'ai's reforms began to surface at the conference. Despite his attempt to pad his new concepts with familiar ones, his more radical proposals clashed with the opinions of many participants at the conference and the report eventually sent to the government was a watered down version of the original plan.19 In September, President Yuan Shih-k'aii issued a decree which estab- lished guidelines for education under the new republic. The three elements of military, utilitarian, and ethical education were included, but Ts'ai's new morality, the French revolutionary trinity, had been rejected in favor of the traditional five relationships. As far as the transcendental aspects of his program were concerned, the part relating to aesthetics was accepted, but world-outlook education was a casualty, many in the conference having criti- cized it as harmful to national interests.20 In spirit, the new system emphasized nationalism and centralized control. Ts'ai's program was simply ahead of its time. Chancellor of Peking University. Ts'ai's rebuff at the hands of the government contributed to his decision to resign from the cabinet and return to Europe. But his retreat from the forefront of educational reform was by no means permanent. His ideas had found favor in many quarters in the progressive community, and in the winter of 1916 he received an invitation to become chancellor of Peking University. President Yuan, a major opponent of Ts'ai's, had died earlier that year, and the climate had improved for his return to prominence in education. Within the more compact environment of the university, Ts'ai was destined to have more success than he had achieved as minister in the first republican cabinet four years earlier. Within a few short years he had instituted a series of major changes that transformed the institution from a corrupt haven for aspirants to a government career, a sordid remnant of the old order, into a forum of cultural and intellectual interchange and into the heart of the new thought tide sweeping into China from abroad. When the famous New Culture move- ment emerged in 1915, Peking University was prepared to become its vibrant heart. But Ts'ai, though now a full-time educational administrator, had not abandoned his vision of the utopia to come, and in articles and speeches given throughout this period, he attempted to utilize his prestige as chancellor of the nation's foremost university to elaborate on his reform ideas. To a degree, Ts'ai's ideas were simply a reflection of the attitudes of most progressives of the time, for if the slogan of the New Culture movement was Ch'en Tu-hsiu'sJ 19 The written record of the Conference is located in Shu Hsin-ch'eng, Chung-kuo Chin- tai Chiao-yii Shih Tzu-liaoP [Materials on the Modern History of Chinese Education], 3 vols.

But in one respect Ts'ai struck a distinctive note in the New Culture movement, for the heart of his message was that spiritual uplift had to accompany technological and material growth, or, to put it in his own terms, Art had to accompany Science.21 Ts'ai, like his reform-minded contemporaries, had great faith in the miracle powers of science and had little doubt that China was on the road to material wealth and power. But where most New Culture intellectuals showed little concern for backing up science with a spiritual sense, Ts'ai feared, as he pointed out in an essay written in 1919, that if China were to rely solely on science for her development, she would undoubtedly become rich and powerful, but she would falter in her primary obligation of helping to build a better world of peace and human brotherhood.22 Ts'ai thus alluded time and again to what he considered the "spiritual" side of the Chinese cultural revival. The old restrictive institutions and beliefs had to be discarded and a new society brought into being. But the new culture should be built not simply in the name of nationalism and material affluence but also in the spiritual sense of humanitarianism and Mutual Aid. To counter those who asserted that the war in Europe proved that the world is run on the basis of the survival of the fittest, he tried to show that an allied victory would symbolize the victory of the forces of democracy, peace, and equality, over the forces of militarism, racism, and dictatorship.23 In his struggle to achieve a cultural renaissance on the basis of spiritual highmindedness as well as material prosperity, Ts'ai was to find enemies on both the right and the left. His first opposition, of course, had come primarily from conservative elements around President Yuan, who were reluctant to abandon traditional precepts, and continued to believe in the relevance of Confucian ideas. During Yuan's presidency, K'ang Yu-weik and his friends had started a movement to make Confucianism the official religion of the state. K'ang's argument was that Christianity had been the instrument that had made European civilization a success, and, therefore, any great civilization should have a religion to provide a firm moral foundation for society. For reasons of their own, a number of other eminent Westernizers supported K'ang in his determination, and by 1916, conservatives were getting some support in their 21 Ts'ai, "Pei-ching Ta-hsueh Yin-yueh Yen-chiu-hui chih yen-shwo-ts'e" [Speech at the Peking University Music Research Association], CC, p. 646. 22Ts'ai, "Hsin wen-hua yun-tung pu-yao wang-liao mei-yii" [The New Culture Move- ment Should Not Forget Aesthetics], CC, pp. 495-496. The kind of problems he had in mind: (1) sacrifice of principle through allowing yourself petty advantages, (2) petty motives behind good principles which would eventually be discovered by the reactionaries, and (3) impatience to achieve utopia which would lead to discouragement when you face obstacles.

In late 1916, Ts'ai had just returned from Europe to take up his new job as chancellor, and he immediately threw himself into the Confucian religion controversy. He was attracted to the issue for two reasons: (1) his opposition to Confucianism in particular, and (2) his opposition to organized religion in general. At a mass meeting in February 1917 convened for the purpose of demanding the right of religious freedom, he made a speech summing up his own views on the issue. First, he expressed amazement that people could consider Confucianism a religion at all, "I have heard it said that certain people want Confucianism to be proclaimed as the national religion of China. This is a great surprise to me. So far as I can see, religion is religion, and Confucius is Confucius. And a nation is a nation with its own sphere of activities. You cannot talk about them all as one."24 He quoted Confucius to show that the sage himself did not conceive of his teaching in a religious sense and that Confucianism had few of the trappings of a true religion. He said he had no objection to Confucian humanism but to the use conservatives would make of the words of the old master if they became the legal instrument of the state. But Ts'ai feared more than Confucian traditionalism. He also dreaded the divisive effect religion could have on Chinese society, and retorted vociferously to K'ang Yu-wei's assertion that the advancement of Western civilization was a consequence of Christianity. Religion hinders the pure search for truth and knowledge, he said, and is thus an obstacle to the further evolution of the human race.25 In a speech entitled "On replacing religion with aesthetics" (I mei-yii tai tsung-chiao shuo)', he maintained that religion was "already a thing of the past" in European countries.26 Why, he said, Europeans only attend church out of force of habit. Why should China, which had never practiced this kind of historical custom in the first place, desire to create a religion now just when it was being gradually abandoned in the West? The controversy provided Ts'ai with an opening to advocate his own ideas, and he did not waste the opportunity. He bombarded audiences and progressive journals with his proposals to replace religion with aesthetics to build up a greater appreciation of beauty in China. He criticized both Confucian ob- scurantism and philosophical materialism and maintained that only through aesthetics could China build that good society that was the dream of her intellectuals. 24Ts'ai, "Tsai Hsin-chiao Tzu-yu-hui chih yen-shwo" [Speech at the Religious Freedom Conference], CC, pp. 724-725. 25This, of course, was his argument against the continued use of Confucianism and Buddhism in modern China. 26Ts'ai, "I mei-yii tai tsung-chiao shwo" [On Replacing Religion with Aesthetics], CC, p. 731 (hereafter cited as "I mei-yii").</page><page sequence="15">399 But what did Ts'ai mean by aesthetics? Aesthetics was broader in scope than art, not just painting, music, and architecture but the entire social en- vironment. Ts'ai may have been the first man in modern China to rely on the scattered information of the social sciences to show the effects of the environ- ment on human behavior.27 He recommended that aesthetics education be started even before the birth of the child. Good prenatal homes for expectant mothers should be provided, and they should be designed in Renaissance or Greek style, not in something oppressive like Egyptian. Nature should always be nearby so that expectant mothers would have the opportunity to relax and avoid tension. After the child is born, art and music should be placed near him in his early years, and when he begins to attend primary school, he should receive formal artistic training.28 In the long run, the entire surroundings should be transformed to conform to man's aesthetic needs. Through the development of man's sense of beauty, then, his dependence on religion would gradually diminish. The European Renaissance had already freed art from its own reliance on religion: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature began to find in Man a more attractive topic.29 Religion, which had to rely for support on the architectural majesty of a Gothic church, the serene beauty of a religious painting, the haunting loveliness of religious music, now would find that its last tie to man had been severed, and it would become a useless relic of the past. But Ts'ai, despite the persistent utopianism in his thought, was too much a realist to believe that the Chinese could be persuaded to adopt aesthetics as a replacement for religion solely because of its contribution to such distant and abstract goals. One of the primary benefits of religion, from the bureau- cratic point of view, as he well knew, was its role in providing cohesion to the nation-state and support for its goals-a fact K'ang Yu-wei had not neglected in his own defense of Confucianism.30 If aesthetics were to be given more than cursory attention by the advocates of militant nationalism and self- strengthening in China, its utility in providing an integrative force for the state would have to demonstrated. And in a speech given in December 1919, he attempted to do just that.31 It was his contention that European greatness was not a product of Christianity, as K'ang Yu-wei had contended, but of its achievements in science and art. The role of science in creating national great- ness was not difficult to demonstrate, and Ts'ai stated simply that France and 27 Ts'ai Shang-ssu, Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei Hsueh-shu Ssu-hsiang Chuan-chiq [A Scholastic and Intellectual Biography of Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei] (Shanghai: T'ang-ti ch'u-pan-she, 1950), p. 328. 28Ts'ai, "Mei-yii chiao-yii shih-shih ti fang-fa" [A Method for Realizing Aesthetics Education], CC, pp. 535-540. 29 Ts'ai, "I mei-yii," CC, p. 732. 30 A number of other reformers tended to view religion in this light, including Liang Ch'i- ch'ao, Yen Fu, and Chang T'ai-yen. 31 Ts'ai, "Wo chih Ou-chan-kuan" [My View of the European War], CC, pp. 710-713.</page><page sequence="16">400 Duiker Germany, as scientifically advanced nations, had survived the rigors of the war better than tsarist Russia, which had collapsed into civil war in 1917. But Ts'ai was anxious to prove that it was not solely the scientific achieve- ments of France and Germany that set them apart from Russia. He also maintained that the former nations possessed a sense of national morality which had inspired their citizens to wage war for a patriotic cause, a devotion to the nation which Russia had obviously lacked. Was this national morality based on religion, he asked? He attempted to demonstrate through a comparison of the three societies that this emphatically was not the case. He said that it is Russia which most emphasizes religion. Moscow alone had more than a thousand churches. Religious prejudice is also strong in Russian society, where the Jews have been cruelly persecuted because of their determination to prac- tice their own ancient Hebrew religion. In Germany and France, on the other hand, religion exerts relatively little influence. Church attendance is slight in Germany, for example, and most college students make a point of mocking the clergy. In France, religion is taken even less seriously. Religious holidays are seldom observed, antireligious sentiment has flourished since Voltaire, and since 1912, the separation of church and state has been decreed, with the clergy prohibited from teaching in all levels of state-run schools. On this basis, he concluded, it is evident that religion is strongest in Russia, where the national sense of morality is the weakest. This certainly indicates the lack of connection between religion and morality, or, more to the point, between religion and national power. What, then, had provided France and Germany with their strength of character? Ts'ai found the answer in their artistic tradition. The national character of Germany, as formed by such artistic geniuses as Goethe, Diirer, and Holbein, stressed nobility, leading to an emphasis on perseverance and strength of will. France, with its Latin temperament, leans to the cultivation beauty as exemplified by David, Ingres, and the rococo style. The emphasis on beauty creates stoicism, an ability to withstand pain and suffering without complaint. It is this artistic heritage which enabled the Germans and the French to endure the privations of the Great War. China did not need a new Jesus, or an old Confucius dressed up as a prophet of God, but a new morality based on aesthetics education. Ts'ai's ideas had mixed results. His optimistic millenarianism, based on belief in the rationality and goodness of man and in the everlasting progress of humanity toward a world of harmony with the all-one, was an agreeable prospect, and accorded with the general utopian spirit of the New Culture period. In the hothouse atmosphere of the early republic, many of his ideas achieved considerable popularity. Even his ideas on aesthetics as a vital element in the ethico-spiritual reconstruction of the Chinese race briefly became a major theme in the New Culture movement. Interest in art and music flour-</page><page sequence="17">401 ished in intellectual circles, and his theory had a certain succes d'estime in academic circles. But over the longer run, his aesthetics proposals met with a mixture of condescension and indifference from the movement as a whole, and made little impression on Chinese society. From our perspective, it is easy to see why his ideas on aesthetics had failed. For most intellectuals, and even more for the mass of the population, they seemed vague and irrelevant to a China now beset with mammoth social prob- lems. While there was a brief mania for cultural and educational reform during the early New Culture period, the progressive movement ultimately turned to violence and political action after the famous May Fourth incident in 1919, and aesthetics was seen by many as a sheer waste of time.32 In the long run, then, the reform movement itself moved away from Ts'ai's philosophical ideas-from his reliance on aesthetics to promote the harmony of man, from his belief in Mutual Aid. Ts'ai continued to press for the imple- mentation of his program, and had some sporadic success in achieving reforms in the educational system.33 But now the tide was running against Ts'ai's vision of the future. A generation with a profound belief in the powers of science had no need for belief in the existence of a spiritual core to the universe. Mutual Aid had little appeal to a generation increasingly attracted by the historical dialectic and the class struggle. It is ironic that we in the West, across the vast gap of culture and time which separates us from the world Ts'ai lived in, can perhaps better understand than did his contemporaries his message in our own world where material affluence has so obviously outstripped our vision of the dignity and quality of human life. 32For example, see Mao Tzu-shui, "Tui-yii Ts'ai hsien-sheng ti i-hsieh hui-i" [Some Recollections of Mr. Ts'ai], Chuan-chi Wen-hsuehr [Biographical Literature], 10, no. 1 (Jan., 1967): p. 35. For academic criticism of Ts'ai's ideas, see F. R. Millican, "Recent Development in Religious Thought," in China Christian Yearbook (1929), p. 140. 38 Ts'ai's most notable successes after 1920 were the liberal 1922 educational reform pro- gram and the establishment of the University Council in 1927. Both were only briefly successful. a E7C J NgVlr b k^ ^ffi 7J c 1 --f d 1Jm M R N e f n &amp;T 4-flatt ?ffiM f % o A."t,:. g AM P fraftRIMA14 h q OrgciavMNPLR4f1=9 i w.1figH r jB-:</page></plain_text>
