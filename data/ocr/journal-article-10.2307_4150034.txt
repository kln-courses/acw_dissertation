<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN OX-FRONTED RIVER-GOD SOPHOCLES, TRACHINIAE 12-131 MICHAEL CLARKE WHAT is a river-god? In the familiar traditions of European art since the Renaissance, he is usually shown as an old man who reclines beside his eponymous river, perhaps pouring its water from an urn. He may well have fish in his beard.2 Such images look back to Roman conventions, which are derived in turn from Hellenistic exem- plars;3 but the continuity masks the fact that in early Greek myth the river-deity-like a sun-god, a mountain-god, or an island goddess-is precisely identified with the geographical entity itself, the body of water which you could swim in or drink from.4 This means that when a verbal or visual artist articulates a myth in which a river-god plays an active part, he engages in a species of image-making that is without parallel in the imaginative resources of our modern languages.

In the opening lines of the Trachiniae, Deianeira speaks of the hor- rors she had to endure when she was wooed by the river Acheloos: gVr\tjiTp y&amp;p iv got rnoTag6q, 'AXEXhtov Wt yo, ;q I,' iv tptoaiv gopgpaiatv Fr trEt irarpdg, (pot·rov ivapyi1 -raipo;, 1X ot' ai6Xoa 8pidCov xt6crdq, ikxor' &amp;v6pE(oit iKcEt Ifpoinptpo. $ K S8 &amp; audoou yevetaio; Kpouvot 8teppavavTo icpivatou otoi^. (9-14) My suitor was a river-I speak of Acheloos-who tried to ask me of my father in three shapes, coming openly as a bull, at other times as a shifting twisted snake, at other times in human shape, but ox-fronted; and from his shadowy beard streams of spring- drink came dripping down. The river came as a bull, as a snake, and as something between bull and man. My focus is on the third of the guises; and to examine it we must first review the remarkable textual problem which looms at this point. In lines 12-13 the Mss read &amp;v6p'(ont Tuwot Pol5Kpacvo;, but Strabo (10.458) quotes the passage with the words &amp;vSpi~&amp;Et )icxet p3ointpot- po;. Strabo's is on balance the difficilior lectio5 and is preferred by most editors;6 for brevity's sake I will refer to its author as "Sophocles" throughout this article, tacitly allowing for the possibility that a differ- ent wordsmith is involved. Both versions use deft and difficult poetic vocabulary, so scribal corruption is unlikely to be the explanation; maybe one or the other is an actor's interpolation,7 maybe both go back 5 See H. Lloyd-Jones and N. Wilson, Sophoclea (Oxford 1990) 150. The version cited by Strabo seems also to have been read by Philostratus, who uses the adjective in an ornately-worded description of a painting of the fight between Heracles and Acheloos (Imag. 4.1).

Cornutus' remark that artists depict rivers as KEpocp6(po1q KaUi tlvpc)&gt;- nox; (De Natura Deorum 42.13). 6 See Lloyd-Jones and Wilson, Davies, and Easterling ad loc. in their editions (respec- tively Oxford 1990; Cambridge 1985; Oxford 1991); Kamerbeek is equivocal (ad loc. in his edition [Leiden 1959]). 7 Cf.

There is, however, one clue suggesting a complex intertextual background to the existence of the doublet. This is the presence of a very similar verbal configura- tion8 in Empedocles' account of the mixed-up hybrid creatures that came into existence in the primordial zoogony: noxr; &amp; v &amp;g l(ptTp6otoamia xlxi &amp;tag(p~TEpva (PqE60ot, pouyevji &amp;v p6rppnpa, tx&amp; 8' 'gnaXtv avatFXv tV &amp;v8po(ptii f3poipava, a getyl va tE jiv atxn' &amp;vipov cti E yuvato(puJ oK tEyOKpo~q ClngVa yitot;.

Either the dramatic poet or poets draw directly on Empedocles, or else all the makers involved are looking back to a further source that is now lost."' Either way, the link shows that the imagery of Acheloos' third guise is care- fully worded and deeply embedded in the traditions of mythopoeic lan- guage, inviting us to take a closer look at the meaning of these hard words. The semantics need to be finely sifted.

In Strabo's version, both the noun and the adjective require clarification. First, Acheloos' human licroq is the outer shape of his body. The word is applied freely to a convex vessel or container,12 most familiarly a storage-jar or box but also the human body. The usage which best illuminates our passage is Plato's application of the word to the body as "vessel" or container of the soul (Timaeus 44a2).'3 The man-shaped outer guise of the shape- shifting river-god, enclosing his true or literal identity within, is struc- turally parallel to the flesh that clothes the human soul--compare the Orphic tag o7iOga tvriv uxii;. What then of the adjective poitnpwot- poq, further characterising this anthropomorphic guise? Since tp1otpa as an independent noun usually refers to the prow of a ship, one might think at first of the sharp projections of a bull's horns.14 However, it can also be used in its broader etymological sense of "front, beginning, prominent part": for example Sophocles refers to Hestia as itpiotpa ,otpfi; "beginning of libation" (Chryses, fr. 726 Radt = schol. Ar. Wasps 846),15 and Theophrastus uses tptktpa for the end of a branch (HP 2.1.3, CP 3.14.7), suggesting that the word is liable to be applied to many different kinds of prominent things. Decisively, -xpotpo; as the second element of a compound adjective regularly refers to the face of a person, as in the instance of (&amp;v6pdctpotpo; cited above from 12 See the careful discussion by J. T. Allen, "The Meaning of riroq," CPh 4 (1909) 353-358. 13 At Timaeus 44a6-9, where the "entire ri6oq of the ~ruX" is closely identified with the oit~ga enclosing the soul. Elsewhere in the same dialogue (45a7, 69e6) the word is used with reference to the head and to the upper body as a whole, presumably depending in the same way on the word's basic meaning as a bulging hollow vessel acting as a con- tainer. Similarly Aristotle recruits the word as a technical term in anatomy, not only for the torso of a human body, but also for the thorax of an invertebrate (HA 491a29, PA 686b14, etc). For full discussion on both issues, see Allen (n. 12). 14 Easterling ad loc. takes Ipoxppotpoq to refer only to the projecting horns of the monster. The river-god would then be described as resembling a horned centaur, as is found in several vase-paintings. This seems to me unsatisfactory in view of the likely semantics of poi6npotpoq and Uro;, which are merely vague unless we take them to refer to a human body-shape with a bovine head. 15 Citing this phrase in a shrewd note at Aesch. Ag. 235, Fraenkel suggests that this use of Rtpotpa in its etymological sense represents a survival from archaic sacral language. In the context of the present article it is fascinating that Hesychius (confirmed by inscrip- tional evidence: see Fraenkel, loc. cit.) glosses Poirxpotpov as "a sacrifice of one hun- dred sheep and one cow," but it is hard to see how a secondary reference to this sacral association could be involved when the same word appears in the Trachiniae.</page><page sequence="5">An Ox-Fronted River-God I () Empedocles: compare also the oT6gea 'aAhinpcotpov of Iphigeneia (Aesch. Ag. 235) and the image of a young warrior as phkaorxt a Kak- ipptpotpov (Aesch. Septem 533), both of which clearly refer to the face and become merely grotesque if the -tp(ntpo; element is taken as a metaphorical reference to a ship's prow or to any other sharp projec- tion.16 On this reading, then, Acheloos has a man's body and a bull's head:17 both variants refer to the same articulation of Acheloos as a monster resembling a Minotaur.'8 As has been noticed before, this fits with neither of the two standard depictions of Acheloos in surviving art. Scenes of the fight between Heracles and Acheloos are common in Attic vase-painting and else- where, and in them the river-god has the form of a bull, usually with a human face below his horns:19 this evidently corresponds to the first of the three guises described by Deianeira, and is again evoked in the cho- rus' later description of Acheloos fighting as I4Kwepto tK'tp(X6pox (pqxoga tax T pov (507-509), "the apparition of a high-horned, four- legged bull." In the other articulation, found mostly on coins from Magna Graecia, he is a man-like figure with bull's horns and occasion- ally ears.20 What is Sophocles doing by conjuring up the Minotaur-like image? Deianeira's whole speech is characterized by careful and mea- sured self-expression in a deeply traditional mode, so we cannot dis- miss the words as loose or extravagant language. One might suppose that the reversed man-bull has been invented here for the sake of its grotesque strangeness and its similarity to Theseus' man-eating foe; this may be part of the truth, but I believe that the full answer is more 6 Attestations of &amp;vrtintprotpoq "projecting opposite" (Soph. Tr 223, Eur. El. 846) and 6o~ ipotpo; ([Aesch.] PV 423) confirm this principle, since they would produce non- sense or whimsy if they depended on images of ships. 17 The fact that Acheloos has a "shadowy beard" is not problematic, since this could refer to the tuft of hair on a bull's chin as easily as to a man's beard. 18 Davies on 12-13; and see further H. P. Isler, Acheloos (Bern 1970; hereafter "Isler") 11-12. 19 On the iconography of Acheloos in art, see esp. Isler, 1 1-28, and his article in LIMC s.v. "Acheloos"; Weiss, 16. Occasionally the human part extends to the torso and/or arms, so that Acheloos looks like a centaur. 2( See C. K. Jenkins, The Coinage of Gela (Berlin 1970) 165-175; Weiss, 21-49. In such coins it is often unclear whether the figure is Acheloos himself or a different, local river-god. On the independent life of the Acheloos-figure in Etruscan art, see esp. J. R.

To begin with, are there any clues to suggest that the bull-headed version of Acheloos was known to art in Sophocles' time? There is one possible example among the numismatic evidence. The earlier coins from Magna Graecia depicting bovine forms of Acheloos or other river- gods nearly always show a bull with a human face, just as in Attic vase- paintings of the fight with Heracles; but on a stater from Metapontum (dated 490-470 B.C.), a man-shaped figure with horns, looking for- wards, has a face which appears too square and bulky to be human and may be that of a bull.21 No certain examples of the bull-headed Ache- loos have hitherto been identified from vase-painting; but scholars may have been misled by the understandable tendency to identify an artistic image in terms of the most famous of the narratives which it suggests at a glance. An Attic vase from about 400 B.C.22 shows a hero with a club attacking a bull-headed man with a club while gripping one of his horns, with a woman holding torches to the left. This has always been read as Theseus and the Minotaur, but there is a tree in the background and the Minotaur was killed underground. I suggest that the scene really shows Heracles and Acheloos: Heracles fought with a club, but Theseus surely went better prepared to face the Minotaur, and the fact that he is gripping the horn is suggestive of the well-attested detail that Heracles broke off one of Acheloos' horns in their struggle;23 there is nothing to identify the woman as Ariadne rather than Deianeira, and the floating Nike is equally appropriate to either fight. Pending a full-scale survey of the iconographic tradition for the Minotaur, I offer this exam- ple as a preliminary indication that the bull-headed and man-bodied articulation of Acheloos may have been a real (if comparatively recherche) item in the mythical vocabulary of Sophocles and his audi- ence. In the same connection it is thought-provoking to consider an Attic vase from about 510 B.C., which shows three bull-headed persons 21 See P. R. Franke and M. Hirmer, Die griechische Miinze (Munich 1972) plate 82, no. 230R; LIMC s.v. Acheloos, no. 75. Franke and Hirmer describe the figure as having a "Stierhaupt"; Weiss (51) interprets in the same way, while Isler in LIMC and Gais ([above, n. 3] 358) describe the face as human but bearded. The face is too much flattened to decide for certain which is right: my own view, that of one with little experience in reading the iconography of coins, is that the head is too broad to be human. 22 Athens, Nat.

There was only ever one Minotaur, and at this period the triple repetition surely implies a group of three individuals rather than a mere frieze-like decoration: it has been suggested that these are three river-gods, perhaps dancing in the chorus of a comedy or a satyr-play.24 Was there, then, an alternative tradition on Sophocles' horizon in which the river-god's familiar combination of human head and bull's body was reversed? We must consider the wider background in mythi- cal image-making. Shape-changing is the prerogative of watery deities,25 especially those of the sea, and it is generally used as a means of resisting capture by a wrestling adversary: witness the guises of Thetis when she resists the advances of Peleus (first attested in Pindar, Nem. 4.62-65), Proteus grappling with Menelaus (Od. 4. 455-461), and Nereus or the unnamed "old man of the sea" (Xiktoq ypov) wrestling with Heracles.26 It is a fair guess that the endlessly fluctuating shapes taken by water underlie this mythical theme;27 but against this must be set the tendency in artistic tradition for each figure to become fixed in a single easily-visualized shape. The Old Man of the Sea, like Oceanos, tends to be depicted with the upper body of a mali and the lower parts of a fish or sea-serpent, while Thetis in combat with Peleus becomes fixed as a woman's body with protomes of animals including fish, 24 Suggested by Weiss, 118-119. Conveniently, an illustration of the vase (London, B.M. B308) happens to appear on the cover of CP 94.4 (1999). 25 The mortal Periclymenus holds the same skill as a gift from his uncle Poseidon ([Hes.] Cat. fr. 33a. 12-24), and most of the more famous shape-shifters have watery asso- ciations of some kind. Nemesis, who takes on a sequence of different guises in her flight from Zeus (Cypria fr. 9 Bernabe), and Metis, whom late sources describe as behaving in the same way as Thetis (see P. M. C. Forbes Irving, Metamorphosis in Greek Myths [Oxford 1990; hereafter "Forbes Irving"] 184n63), are both daughters of Ocean; the power of shape-changing held by Dionysus in the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus (44 ff.) presumably relates to his liquid identity as wine itself. 26 See J. Gantz, Early Greek Myth (Baltimore 1994; hereafter "Gantz") 405-406; Forbes Irving, 175; G. Ahlberg-Cornell, Myth and Epos in Early Greek Art (Jonsered 1992; hereafer "Ahlberg-Comell") 105-107. The earliest literary record surviving is from Pherecydes (FGH 3 F 16A; Apollodorus Library 2.5.11); otherwise the evidence is mostly artistic. An inscription expanded as &amp;Xtoq ypwov labels a depiction of the combat in a relief on a shield-band from Olympia, c. 550-540 (Olympia Mus. B 188 1, band XXX delta: see Ahlberg-Cornell, fig. 186; LIMC s.v. "Halios Geron," no. 2). 27 See G.

It is noteworthy in this context that one of his guises in the Sophocles passage is that of a snake: Oceanos, Triton, and Nereus are all liable to be depicted in ser- pentine or semi-serpentine form, and images of Nereus' combat with Heracles may well have contributed directly to the iconographic tradi- tion concerning Acheloos, since an unlabeled image could be inter- preted as either fight.31 It is specifically because Acheloos is a river that two of his appropriate guises involve the shapes of a man and a bull. From Homer onwards bulls are associated with rivers as their appropri- 28 See Ahlberg-Cornell, 49-50 with fig. 57; LIMC s.v. "Thetis," nos. 12-20. This iconographic tradition for Thetis associates her closely with her father: on the shield-band depicting Heracles fighting him (see above), protomes of snake and fire are rising from his human-shaped head, while he has the lower parts of a fish. 29 Since Oceanos himself is regularly named as a river, the distinction between fresh- water and salt-water gods may be less important than modern common sense might sug- gest (cf. West on Hesiod Theogony 133). A full discussion of the problem is beyond the scope of this article. 30 For 'AXFXStoq as an archaic or grandiloquent synonym for (fresh) water see esp. Eur. Bacch. 625, Andr. 167; Hyps. 149; Arist. Lysistr 381, fr. 365 Kassel-Austin; R. Renehan, Greek Lexicographical Notes (= Hypomnemata 45, Gbittingen 1975), s. . The water of Acheloos was said to have been used in the mixing of the first wine from Oineus' vines, which perhaps explains why his name is often used in the context of wine- mixing (Soph. Athamas fr. 5 Radt; Achaeus, fr. 9.1 Snell). At II. 21.195 Achilles specifies Acheloos as the type or paragon of rivers-"not even Acheloos could fight against Zeus"-and it is remarkable that the next line was rejected by Megaclides and Zenodotos, making Achilles go on to describe Acheloos as the source of all other rivers and even of the sea: this may draw on a tradition which made Acheloos the origin or master of all water like the Mesopotamian Ea/Enki (U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Der Glaube tier Hellenen [Berlin 1931] 1.93 with n. 2). 31 Acheloos fights Heracles in snake-bodied form on an Attic red-figure stamnos inscribed with the combatants' names (London, BM no. E437; LIMC s.v. "Acheloos," no. 245). Isler (16) suggests that the names have been inscribed specifically in order to distiln- guish the scene from the more familiar scene of Heracles fighting a sea-divinity. The ver- sion of the fight between Heracles and Acheloos given by Ovid (Met. 9.8-88), in which he successively takes the shapes of snake and bull, presumably depends on this strain of the tradition, unless indeed Ovid has actually drawn Sophocles' account of the wooing into his evocation of the fight.</page><page sequence="9">An Ox-Fronted River-God 105 ate sacrificial victims,32 but this only reflects a deeper association. A case in point here is the sudden emergence of Skamandros as a personal agent in his fight with Achilles in Iliad 21.33 The essence of the scene is that the river attacks Achilles as a body of water, without explicit per- sonification: it may well be right to see this articulation as an example of what Erbse has called "the pure Homeric spirit"34 in its refusal to introduce the baroque or fantastic motif of shape-changing. However, Homer twice moves close to the point of depicting the river in the guise of a bull or a man. During Skamandros' initial surge onto Achilles, he roars like a bull: ... 6 8' taooiTo oi'6daxrt i0ov, av'raOt 6' ptvE ~peopa KrKO)ltEvo, , OE 6&amp; VEKpoI)q rtoXhoziS, oi' ira Ka0' arbyv iXt; oav, oi~; K6v' 'AxXhXE6;" ToD; CCPaXXZE 0GpaýE, gtEl41Ucdk fiJUE TaCpoý, Xpoaov88.... (Iliad 21.234-238) He surged in, rushing with his swell, and pressed all the banks as he roared, and thrust out many corpses-they were all through him in abundance, slain by Achilles-these he thrust out onto the shore, roaring like a bull ... Again, when he speaks to Achilles he does so "in the likeness" of a man: Kai vL K' icxt t ovaqI KyroVE f aova; Kg; 'AXtX4A;q, Ci V xoodievo; xpooaPr noralgb faOUtB6viv, a&amp;vpt Eiod1GLevoq, pae 6' K (P0~7Yato &amp;8v ; ... (Iliad 21.21 1-213) Now swift Achilles would have killed still more Paiones, if the deep-whirling river had not addressed him in anger, in the likeness of a man, and spoken from the deep whirl ... 32 For the cult of Acheloos in Attic contexts see esp. Pausanias 1.34.3, 1.41.2; Plato Phaedrus 230b. 33 See further Weiss, 12-15. 34 H. Erbse, Untersuchungen zur Funktion der Gitter im homerischen Epos (Berlin 1986) 47.</page><page sequence="10">106 Michael Clarke The phrase is indeterminately poised between a comparison and an epiphany in anthropomorphic shape: it is impossible and probably mistaken to try to decide which way to read the image,35 and the impor- tant point is that the articulation is introduced purely in order to explain how the river speaks to Achilles in words. As soon as the speech is over the image is irrelevant, and it is as a body of water that Skamandros continues his struggle with the hero.36 Following the lead of a Homeric scholiast, Gregory Nagy has suggested a complex link between this episode of the Iliad and the lost poem which Archilochos composed about the battle between Acheloos and Heracles.37 The scholiast com- pares Homer's bull-simile to the full metamorphosis described by Archilochos: 9VZtEEv 6pgrq vt;vre -v 'AeXFoov ',at poxav 'Hpacr d&amp;y(ovt- 6l1gevov.

(Schol. Hom. 11. 21.137 = Archilochos, fr. 287 West) From this starting-point they made Acheloos a bull when fighting against Heracles. Archilochos did not dare to pit Acheloos against Heracles as a river, but as a bull; Homer was the first to set up the combat as one of a river and a hero. Each, then, expressed the same underlying idea in accordance with his power. Translated into Neoanalyst terms, the scholiast is saying that each poet clothed the association between bull and river-god in the articulation appropriate to his genre: Homer approaches but does not fully realize 35 Compare the association between moving gods and flying birds, which is expressed sometimes as a metamorphosis, sometimes as a simile, and sometimes as an indetermi- nate association between those two extremes (F Dirlmeier, Die Vogelgestalt homerischer Gijtter [SHAW 1967, Abh. 2, Heidelberg]; H. Bannert, "Zur Vogelgestalt der G6tter bei Homer," WS 12 [1978] 29-42; H. Erbse, "Homerische G6tter in Vogelgestalt," Hermes 108 [1980] 259-274). 36 For a broader treatment of this issue in the context of Homeric image-making, see Clarke (n. 4) 272-282. 37 G.

It is thought-provok- ing to return from this record of variant image-making to Deianeira's speech in the Trachiniae, where she declares herself unable to describe the combat between her suitors: xCi -p6inov Av &amp;v ir6v wov O~K Ov tE1uOt141' 01o) y p oi' ( a0X' 00o-;t ;v OaKQio)V nprni%; ,r'ijo&amp; O a;, 68,' &amp;,v xyoi.

This strange reference to some other witness, who could describe exactly what happens, seems to beg to be read as a metatheatrical allu- sion to the author or speaker of an earlier account of the fight, perhaps specifically that composed by Archilochos.38 If this last clue carries weight, we can be still more confident that Deianeira's account of Acheloos is deliberately referring back to established tradition concern- ing the guises of the river-god. These stray clues suggest that the river- god's association with man-shape and bull-shape was liable to be dressed in different forms in different strains of the mythopoeic tradi- tion, and that Deianeira's description is deliberately located within that discourse. From further afield there is independent evidence that human-animal hybrids played a significant part in Sophocles' dramatic thought. The most famous or notorious example will have been the metamorphosis of Tereus into a hoopoe described or depicted on stage in the play of that name, which Aristophanes laughs at in the Birds (99-101).39 The 38 Apart from Archilochos' version, the story seems to have been told also by Pindar in a dithyramb, but the evidence is scanty (fr. 249a Maehler = schol. D Gen. 11. 21.194). It is intriguing that Dio Chrysostom records (Orations 60.1) that in Archilochos' version Deianeira narrated the battle to Nessus while he was sexually assaulting her. If so, Sopho- cles' allusion might be read as an implicit rejection of Archilochos' unrealistic version; but in the absence of detailed evidence I offer this only as speculation. 39 Tereus fr. 581 seems to be from a messenger-speech describing the transformation, but this need not imply that Sophocles did not present Tereus on stage in his hoopoe form. Pace Dunbar ad loc., I suggest that Aristophanes' Xugat'lverFa (Birds 100) could hardly refer to a messenger-speech alone but implies the kind of degradation that would</page><page sequence="12">108 Michael Clarke shape-changing of Thetis was described in concrete detail by Peleus in the Lovers of Achilles (see fr. 150 Radt). Most instructive for our purposes is a fragment of the Inachus, in which Io's transformation into a cow by Zeus was described in grotesque detail: Ic6prl; &amp;5 E'j-Olp ICpcXr[ (Pt)EI Kapa ta-up(O[ af3:XoIv rno' itlot[ .... toWNV &amp;8 Xl [ai...

(tr.

However, it has been suggested that the words yxvil Xlatva referred to the Sphinx,40 perhaps "worked in linen" as part of a tapestry, in which case the speaker would seem to have been be caused by presenting the actual spectacle of Tereus transformed into a hoopoe on stage, perhaps by means of a bird-shaped mask. 4) See R. Carden, The Papyrus Fragments of Sophocles (Berlin 1974) 54-55; D. F. Sut- ton, Sophocles' Inachus (Meisenheim 1979) ad loc. Although the animal part of the Sphinx is not referred to as "lion" in surviving tragedy, where the whole creature is called C6ov (Soph. OT 391; Ar. Frogs 1287 = Aesch. Sphinx fr. 236 Radt), in vase-painting monsters with human heads and lion bodies are labelled "Sphinx" from the sixth century onward (Gantz, 23-24). A. M. Dale (CR 10 [1960] 194) suggested that ~atvca here has the more general sense "monstrous animal," comparing Callisto described in choral lan- guage as having a oaXiig heavivrl when turned into a bear (Eur. Helen 379).</page><page sequence="13">An Ox-Fronted River-God 109 conveying the idea that the transformation left her as a hybrid with woman's head and animal body. Perhaps the point made by the speaker here was precisely that Io was not left in this halfway state? However that may be, for us the significance of this passage lies in the fact that Io did not have to be depicted as fully transformed into a four-legged cow: she could equally be seen as a cow with a woman's face,41 or (as in the Prometheus Bound) a woman with two horns, her bovine trans- formation represented in vestigial form.42 By choosing one extreme from a fluid range of variables available in the tradition, Sophocles articulates one of many possible versions for his own purposes, which in this instance are unguessable because of the fragmentary state of the play. Compared with this description in the Inachus, that in the Trachiniae represents a more complex pattern of visualization: in the three guises adopted by Acheloos for courtship, Sophocles moves sys- tematically through the sequence of available articulations. The first of his guises is the river-god in four-footed bull-shape, with or without the implication of the man-like face which he has in the usual artistic image; the second, snake-like articulation represents him as a thing of shifting and flowing movement, whose amorphous fluidity makes it a halfway house towards the third articulation; and this in turn, man- shape with a bull's head, acts as the direct opposite of the first guise. If this is right, between the first and the third guises Sophocles is set- ting up a bifurcation which has deep roots in the artistic tradition. A. Snodgrass has highlighted what he calls the "four-footed conven- tion" in Archaic art, whereby the combination of a human-type head and torso with a quadruped body was used by artists as a symbol of monstrosity and "otherness."43 The key examples are from two vases with relief images, among the oldest Greek artefacts demanding to be read as depictions of knowable myths. One is a Cycladic amphora 41 She is depicted in this way on an oinochoe of c. 440-430 B.c. (Boston, MFA 1901.562: see LIMC s.v. "lo," no. 33). 42 See esp. M. Griffith at [Aesch.] PV 588, contrasting the "cow-horned girl," pouripw noapp0vo1., of that line (sim. 674; cf. Hdt. 2.41) with lo transformed fully into a cow in Aeschylus' Suppliants (po3v rilv yuvacic' i0riKEv 'ApyE^ta 0~6 [299]; sim. Bacchylides, Odes 19.16, 24). Forbes Irving points out (215-216) that the early vase paintings depict her as fully transformed into a cow, then "about 470" she appears as a woman with cow's horns. She is shown as a cow's body with a human head on an oinochoe of about 440-430 B.c. (Boston, MFA 1901.562; LIMC s.v. "lo," no. 33). 43 A.

The fragment comes from the Cretans, that extraordinary play about Pasiphab's passion for the bull and its appalling issue. In stichomythia the newborn monster is described: - ca]po l, tCLEK tI KOai poro[i 58tXhit qc(pI t. - 1jKi]outcx walrnpi'v t;S 8' o[ 44 Paris, Louvre CA 795: LIMC s.v. "Gorgo, Gorgones," no. 290.

Schefold, Friihgriechische Sagenbilder (Munich 1964) 37 and pl. 25A; Caskey (n. 44) 30. Ahlberg-Cornell (126) suggests that the scene depicts not the mythical event itself but its re-enactment in the "Labyrinth Dance" with a model or pantomime Mino- taur. If this is right it does not materially reduce the value of the image as testimony to the iconographic tradition. For a further, fragmentary Archaic representation which may have depicted the Minotaur in the same way, see Ahlberg-Cornell, 125. 46 As I have not had the opportunity to view the vase, I rely on Ahlberg-Cornell's description of the damaged Minotaur as having "a semi-human head with long neck hair and probably a human face" (126). 47 A good example of continuing artistic exploitation of the "four-footed convention" can be seen in the varying articulations used in Archaic and Classical depictions of cen- taurs. Centaurs are sometimes shown as horses with human arms and faces superficially added, sometimes as men with horses' hind legs added on at the rear (cf. Ahlberg-Cor- nell, 107). Sometimes at least, the implication seems to be that the former articulation highlights their wild bestiality, while the latter is appropriate when their more civilized aspect is to the fore: Cheiron, for example, is shown as a man wearing a cloak with token horse-legs projecting from behind. A striking example is LIMC s.v. "Cheiron," no. 47, from a now lost hydria from c. 510 B.c.</page><page sequence="15">An Ox-Fronted River-God I I I - o rp]voI;tq (ppov KCp&amp;ta t[apettov (popEc. - tetpraa0ehiE; y yp i7 1&amp;pago[; pXetat; - 5~ju]ot [j]iaivrl(t) &amp;aic[ - Kc]ai zt npb; toi'o&amp;' axho [ - Cii]ono; oi'opout Kc`pcov [ - ]] Yp [ - ] oppa6io8 - ](aO[6t] &amp; ,[]pb o 0 P o6[ 7[XcTat; - zp]q[ou]otv o0 TEKVrVZE ou [ (Euripides Cretans fr.

Enough is preserved here to show that the questioner is asking whether the hybrid has taken the bull-headed or man-headed form, and is then moving on to the most disturbing question imaginable: who will suckle this child, cow or woman? It is fascinating in this context to recall a vase-painting, slightly later in date than this play, which shows a baby Minotaur sitting in the lap of its mother or its nursemaid, perhaps directly inspired by this same question.48 I suggest, then, that the artis- tic and poetic traditions for Acheloos and the Minotaur represent cases of a single problem: in a hybrid monster with human and animal ele- ments, how are the parts to be combined and sorted? In the history of art, it seems, the question was resolved or crystallized in opposite ways for the two monsters, but the memory of a more fluid stage in the devel- opment of this "visual grammar" will not have been forgotten among 48 Paris, Cab.

Significantly, several vases represent Theseus' fight with the bull-headed Minotaur and Heracles' fight with the bull-bodied Acheloos in adjacent panels, deliberately articulating the correspondence between the two.49 Just as in the case of Io in the Inachus, Sophocles is drawing on a peculiarly archaic, perhaps half-for- gotten, fragment of his artistic and poetic inheritance when Deianeira describes Acheloos taking on the form of a bull-headed man.50 As an echo of earlier stages in the development of mythical motifs in art, and because of its sinister associations with the more famous monster faced by Theseus, it will have served for Sophocles' audience as the culmi- nating horror of the courtship undergone by Deianeira. Nor, indeed, is it guaranteed that this is merely an example of exuberant poetic fancy at work. The echo of Empedocles discussed at the beginning of this article hints, at least, that the shifting shapes of river-god and Minotaur impinged also on deep scientific speculations concerning the identities of living things and the origin of species, cast in linguistic forms that have the power to be philosophical as well as vividly baroque.

On the latter see Isler, 13 and pl. 1; Schefold (n. 43) 66-67 and pl. 58b. 5o Weiss draws a parallel with the iconographic and poetic tradition regarding lo in order to speculate (102-107) about the development of the iconographic tradition for Acheloos and other river-gods in the course of the fifth century, suggesting that under the influence of tragic productions earlier and more obviously monstrous articulations were gradually replaced by milder versions in increasingly man-like shape. Alongside this development the poetic tradition perhaps preserved images from the earlier period which have now become strange and archaic.</page></plain_text>
