<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL PRESSURES BEHINĎ ŤHE BHARGAVA INTERPOLAT ION OF THE MAHlBHARATA ву S. Bhattacharji Scholars think that nearly eight centuries elapsed between the incep- tion and completion of the Mahõbhãrata - the composition went on conti- nuously for the core, heroic epic, and sporadically, and intermittently, after that. During these eight centuries other literatures were composed in northern India - among these were Buddhist texts like the Mahavastu and Lalitavistara , some Jain texts, the Arthašastra of Kautilya, the Yajñavalkya Smrti , Patañjali's Mahãbhãsya , Vätsyäyana's Kãmasutra, the Rämäyana and the Mamisamhitã. Those of the compositions which belong to the latter part of the period i. e. the early centuries A. D. betray the emergence of a coherent and composite social ethos. An inscription of 536 A. D. in the village of Khoh in the Madhya Pradesh mentions a Mahãbhãrata of a hundred thousand verses,1 the present critical text of Poona has some 82,000 verses. The epic itself speaks of a text of 24,000 verses.2 How this nucleus of 24,000 verses was inflated into 82,000, is also indicated in the epic itself : it had three beginnings with the episodes of Manu, with Astîka and with Uparicara/' That is, the epic was composed at three distinct stages ; it also has three different names, possibly corresponding to the stages of composition : Jaya , Bhãrata and Maha - bharata} The epic says that after composing it, the author Vyãsa read it to his son Šuka, and then to his other disciples.6 Suka recited it at Janame- jaya's snake sacrifice, and probably added the ethical tales of perennial value. But this interpolation is not very bulky and aesthetically blends with the spirit of the heroic tale. Much later, at áaunaka's twelve-year Soma sacrifice, the 1 Cf. the popular synonym of the epic, satasahasri . 2 caturvim'sátisahasrim cakre bharata-samhitam / upakhyãnair viriä tãvad bhcratam procyate budhaih //I. 1. 61 s Manvadi bharatam kecid astikãdi tatha ' pare / tathoparicarâdy any e viprãh samyag adhtyate //I. 1. 50 * Ш. 4. 4. 6 Paila, Sumantu and Vaisampäyana, idam dvaipayanah pUrvam putram adhyUpayac chukam / tato 'nyebhyo 'mtrïïpebhyah íisyebhyah pradadau prabhtth /I I. 1. 63</page><page sequence="2">4f0 AÉORÌ : Amrtamahotsava Voîurnè king requested Ugrašravas, the son of the charioteer Lomaharsaça to recite the epic. But, significantly enough, his first request was for a historical acco- unt of the Bhärgava line,6 thus giving the author of this section the scope for advertizing the Bhärgavas, magnifying their achievements and also to add extra credential to this interpolated section. When this was over, Šaunaka expressed a desire to hear Vyasa's epic, called Jaya .7 The bard Lomaharsana and his son Ugrašravas, both of the charioteer family, together composed sections of a huge chunk of interpolation which constitutes more than two-thirds of the epic in its present form ; this is called the Bhärgava or brahmanical interpolation. Stylistically this section is infe- rior, over-ornate, verbose and repetitive.8 Adi, Vana, Drona, Šalya, Santi and Anusãsana parvans largely belong to this interpolated section, while Ãsvamedhika, Ãsramavãsika, Mausala, Mahãprasthãna and Svargärohana possibly belong wholly to this section. It is interesting to note that it is the Bhärgavas, in whose time Kjsna was born, who glorify him. Bhrgu's son Kavi begot Šukra whose daughter Devayãní was the mother of Yadu ; Kysna was born in this line. So it is only/ natural that the Bhärgavas would glorify Kysna inordinately until he virtually becomes a god. The Manusamhitã chronologically belongs to the same period as these interpolations ; it was also composed by a pupil of the Bhärgava clan.9 The Mãhãbhãrata does not mention any Dharma-sutras or Smrtis. " At the time when the Mahãbhãrata was composed the real origin of the old sütras had been forgotten, while the text had not been materially altered."10 Thus we see that scions and disciples of the Bhfgu clan composed two immensely in- fluential texts during the early centuries A. D. viz. the Manusamhitã and the Bhärgava interpolation of the Mahãbhãrata . The modern scholar M. R. Yardi has admitted Sukthankaťs views regarding the stages of the composition of the epic11 but proposed two more authors who composed the Harivamša and the Parvasamgrahaparvan of the epic. The Harivamša is a much later work, and the parvana chapter is 8 tat ra vamsam ah am purvam srotum icchami bhargavam / 1. 5. 3 7 yam katham Vyasasampannam tam ca bhUyah pracaksva me / I. 53. 28 8 Cf.

The inception of these are both adequately anticipated in the Bhãrgava section. It was in this interpolation that the battle story which was originally being composed in favour of the ruling Kaurava dynasty when the war was on, became transformed in favour of the victorious Pãndavas, after victory had changed sides. This composition of Süta Lomaharsana and Sauti Ugrašravas is the subject of our discussion. Why did they compose these sections ? Another important change concomi- tant with the Bhãrgava recension was the increasing use of the Sanskrit lan- guage. The Prakrits were flourishing but the host of foreign invaders promo- ted Sanskrit. Thus Vãsishka used Sanskrit in the Yüpa inscription at the beginning of the second century A. D ; Rudradãman used Sanskrit in his famous inscription in 150 A. D. Thus the foreign ruling dynasties sought linguistic uniformity through Sanskrit and the priests were only too happy to oblige because , remote from and beyond the comprehension of the common people, it became another powerful tool of the priestly class. Because the Mahãbhãrata had already attained a great measure of popularity through its poetic excellence, the Bhãrgavas would not have found a better medium for propagating their views. An analysis of the nature of their composition will give us a clue to the reason of this inter- polation. In religion this Bhãrgava section creates for the first time a theology and a scripture for a sectarian religion, centring mainly around two gods, Šiva and Krsna. Rudra was a wholly unimportant god in the Rgveda, as Rudra-Šiva. however, he is comparatively important in the Brãhmanas. But he really becomes a significant, formidable and major god in this section of the epic. Greek travellers mention a people called Siboi, presumably a Šaiva sect. The first anthropomorphic representation of Šiva is found in the Bhãr- gava section. Šiva is built up assiduously and slowly as a major god. In the Dronaparvan, we first meet the cosmic destroyer in Šiva ; in the Sauptika- parvan also he appears in the same role. Krsna sings his praises at several places in the Dronaparvan and elsewhere.1 J Vyãsa, too, sings a hymn to the supreme lord Šiva; 1:5 other gods sing doxologies to him before the destruction of the three cities.1 Asvatthãman 6 and Upamanyu16 praise him as the lord of creation, preservation and destruction, as the supreme epiphany of godhead. Some of this was already there in the Bhãrata , state of the epic by Vaisampãyana.

The other predominant god in the Bhãrgava portion was Kfsna, his deification was wrought by the Suta and the Sauti. The Väsudeva and Nãrã- yanîya sects already existed ; what happened now was, first, Visnu and Nãrãyaça syncretically blended with Kfsna and the resultant figure became the Supreme Lord. Krsna as a god is absent in the Ksattriya core epic, Jaya , and in the friend of the Pãndavas, as also in the Mathurã King. Later, he became the focal point of the Väsudeva sect's theology.17 In the VaišampS- yana version he is not a god except to the Vjrsnis. The human Krsça of this section touches Yudhisthira's feet as an inferior to a superior, as an ordinary man to a pious, saintly character. Later, in the Bhãrgava section Yudhi- §thira circumambulates Kjrsna in the manner of a devotee. Kfsça does not connote any divinity to Bhurišravas, who upbraids Arjuna and says, " The Vrçnis are uncivilized, evil men without any discrimination between sin and righteousness ; how can you respect a man from such a clan ? "18 The human Kfsga solicits a boon from Umä who says, ť how can a mere man know the way of the righteous ? 49 The first representation of Krsna is on a coin of Agathocles in 40 B.C., the only one in a foreign ruler's coin. Later, Heliodoros called himself a Bhâgavata, a devotee of Väsudeva. After VUBU-Näräyaaa, Väsudeva had emerged as a separate entity from within the cluster of the five Vjrsni heroes ' Vyuha, and gradually rose to a supreme godhead. The Bhãrgava section aims at proclaiming his indisputable supremacy. The first proclamation is in the Sabhãparvan in reply to the provocative challenge of Šisupála. Later, in the Vanaparvan, Mãrkandeya sees the universe inside the belly of the infant floating on the cosmic ocean.20 The enlarged and magnified version of this is in the Dronaparvan and also elsewhere. In the Vanaparvan we have doxo- logies of Kfsna ; these are embedded in illustrative episodes. Even the Kalkin incarnation appears in the Vanaparvan. There are some special characteristics of the new sectarian religion which emerged and evolved around Šiva and Kjrçna. Now for the first time a god assumes the role of a spiritual saviour. The first one was the histori- cal Buddha in the Lalitanstara , Mahãvastu , Avadãnasataka and elsewhere in Buddhist literature. The Vedic gods are not personal saviours ; they merely 17 Cf. sarvesam vasudevanUm krsne laksmï pratisthita / VIII. 27. 62. VII. 118. 19 katham hi naramãtrena sakyo jnätum satãm g etti h ?

Life itself was sd good that the aim was to enjoy it fully foi: as long as possible! Hence, Vedic poets pray for long life, plenty, prosperity, ctc. i. e. earthly bliss in all its diverse aspects. During the period of the later Brãhmanas and early Upanisads life began to be portrayed as basically evil, bccause it entailed repeated births and deaths. So the objective now became the snapping of the chain of this serial existence. Now the goal was liberation and these gods grant liberation. Now for the first time a per- sonal relation was established between a god and his devotee in absolute faith and surrender, bhakti. This bhakti is now regarded as the only right раф for liberation. Needless to say, during the period between the Maurya, anfi Gupta empires the only way to receive favours. from the monarch was surreur der to his authority, through bhakti ; this was reflected to some extent in the religion of this period. In connection with bhakti came paja , icons, temples, and new kinds of oblations. In the Bhagavadgítã Krsna says; " I accept the offerings of a self-restrained devotee when he offers me leaves, flowers, fruits and water with devotion ".21 Image worship also appears for the first time in this Section. Kjsna says, " Whatever figure the dedicated devotee fashions to worship me in,, I accept or assume that shape. "-3 Now also for the first time we hear of the merits of fasting and the piety that accrues from vows23 observed. All this is inflated and magnified in the Purãnas, but they appear first in this sectiop. of the epic and we hear that one cannot go to heaven without observing vows and visiting pilgrimages.21 The Vanaparvan gives an elaborate account of pilgrimages,-5 riverside and seaside, resorts, hills and other beautiful natural spots as also commercial centres converted to pilgrimages. Incarna- tions of Visnu are mentioned in this interpolation ; we meet Nfsimha, Vãmana, Parasurãma, Balarãma and Kalkin.20 Eschatology, heaven and hell came to be propounded now for the first time.

In the Bhãrgava section we have accounts of omens and portents.37 Sacrificial fees for priests had already figured prominently in the later Brãhmanas, now a different category of priests who conducted pãjãs, helped at the final pãrana ceremony of vows and guided pilgrims to offer their pujas at pilgrimages. These led to the temple priests to glory who now demanded and received fat fees. The philosophical theories behind all this had already been propoun- ded in the Upanisads; chief among these are the theories of Karman and transmigration. What is new now is the concept of fate.2^ Logically, fata- lism is incompatible with the theory of Karman, but in the Bhãrgava section they coexist peacefully. The Anusãsanaparvan begins with the tale of Gautamî's son's premature death - Kala, Mrtyu and Karman shift respon- sibility into each other until the dead boy himself becomes ultimately responsi- ble for his death. The trouble was that neither Gautami nor her son knew why the death had occurred ; to them it appeared as fate, ' a-drsta '. Innumera- ble episodes are invented to establish the theory of Karman and its effects. At some places there are controversies between Karman and human endea- vour, which is the mightier, but no conclusion is arrived at. There is some- thing like Calvin's theory of predestination as opposed to the theory of divine grace, as unmerited favour. One question brings out the inherent contradi- ction of these theories: what happens to the so-called departed soul? Liberation ? heaven ?, hell ? ghost existence ? rebirth ? as man ? or as ani- mals ? Which first, and which for how long ? Nowhere is there a paradigm explaining clearly the proportionate effect of actions after death. We have instances of the same effect for different karmans and vice versa. Citragupta is a mere file-clerk, there is no officer above him. There is a sudden plethora of the supernatural in this last interpolated section. The core epic was basi- cally a tale of human heroes ; gods did not figure prominently in it. " That the supernatural is less prominent in heroic poetry than in folktales is due doubtless to the fact that the courts of the period possessed a far higher degree of culture than the rest of the population. "29 It was the less educated superstitious priestly authors of the Bhãrgava section who introduced and multiplied the supernatural elements in their interpolation. To complicate matters, we now have for the first time copious instan- ces of curses and boons.

Pleased with services received they grant boons - but there is no causal link between the act and the curse or boon. So to bewildered humans curses and boons take the form of fate. The theories of rebirth, Karman and fate serve the same purpose : they present the past and the future as unknown and unknowable and thus render the present also as inscrutable. All this inevitably hand over power and control over the common man's life to a particular class which pretends to have access to the mysteries of life. The first interest of this privileged class in a class-divided society is to receive implicit an unquestioning loyalty of the masses which in concrete terms is spelt out as abject servility. In the name of expiating unknown sins of the previous life which resulted in misery in this, and in ensuring rebirth in a better station, this class demands and gets loyalty and service from the common man. The Bhãrgava interpolation is replete with anecdotes illustra- ting this. In society we find the king is magnified with a grandeur in this section. He is virtually deified and is the 'guru ' for this and the next life; he who insults or ignores him loses the merits of his gifts, sacrifices, and of ^räddha ( he performs ). i0 The righteous king is an eternal god, even gods honour a righteous king.31 Man desiring prosperity first selects a king.32 Men should bow before the king as disciples to the preceptor ; as the gods praise Indra, so should the subject praise their king.33 A king should never be regarded as human and should never be ignored, he is a great god in the human form.34 The invading tribes who arrived in northern India in the late centuries B. C. and the early centuries A. D., all regarded their kings as superhuman beings. The Bactrian Greeks, the Romans, the people of the Han Kingdom, the Scythians, the Kushctnas, the Yueh Chihs, the Persians - all magnified their kings to a superhuman dimension. Their coins and inscriptions bear testimony to such a belief ; their kings are frequently called devaputras, sons of the gods, and carry a halo around their heads. India imbibed these influences and had a succession of powerful kings until the end of the Gupta 80 paralokagurum caiva rajanam yo'vamanyate / na tasya dattam na hutam na srãddham phalati kvačit / XII. 65.28 31 manusanam adhipatim devabhutam sanatanam / devas ca bahu manyante dharmakãmam narešvaram //ХП. 65-29 3a evam ye bhutimiccheyuh prthivyam manavah kvačit / kuryïï rãjãnam evãgre prajãnugrahakãranãt // XII. 67. 32 83 namasyeyus ca tam bhaktya sisya iva gurum sada / deva iva sahasrãksam prajã rãjãnam antike // XII. 67.33 naht jatv avamantavyo manusya iti bhïïmipah / mahatì devaffî hyesü nararUpena tisjhati // XII. 67. 40</page><page sequence="8">476 ABORl :■ Amrtamahotsava Voluti# empire. Hence, royal power was regarded as another form of divine power j the Bhãrgava section endorsed this enthusiastically. In the time of Samudça7 gupta, in Harisena's encomium we hear that the king was mighty because he could arrest, release, and grant favours ; his majesty was a blend of these.55 So the royal authority rested on the king's absolute power to capture, release and grant favours to men. In a Nasik inscription in the early second century A. D.» we hear of King Gautami Balasrï who protects the four varnas. Also at Nasik, King Nahapâna's son-in-law Usabhadãta gave bountifully to a brahmin for bis daughter's wedding. The inscription of SãtakarnI at Nanaghat says that the king gives liberally to brahmins and that he has prevented interr caste mixtures.36 A Gupta inscription says that not fulfilling commitment; of charity (by the, king) leads to horrible consequences. This then was vyhat was expected of the king : he should give largesses to brahmins and he should maintain the caste barriers intact, so that there was no interlap bet- ween castes. Varnadharma, caste rules, is one of the cardinal concerns of the Bhãr- gava section. The brahmin, highest in caste hierarchy, deserves worship like the king ; his wrath spells disaster. The episode of Vãtãpi and Ilvala is a casç in point,37 so : is the tale of Kãrtaviryãrjuna and Parasurãma;1'* they prove that a brahmin is a veritable god on earth.30 Irrespective of the good and evil of his conduct, a brahmin may never be insulted.40 A brahmin can take the yyealth of all other castes, but woe to him who tries to grab a brahmin's weaith. Sedition in other castes, merit capital punishment, but a brahmin guilty of sedition can only be exiled.11 When men, desirous of having a king, anointed Pfthu, son of Vena, as King, his very first promise to his future subjects was that he would not punish brahmins and would prevent inter- marriage.42 Like the long and bitter conflict between church and state in Europe, here, too, the strife started in the age of the Brahmana literature.43 Ja .the Bhãrgava section we read " to whom does the earth belong ? the brahmin or therksatriya?" The answer is: "Everything on this earth belongs: to the brahmin. " " Then why is the ksatriya the king ?

"44 Anecdotes tell us that one who stole a brahmin's fruits became a monkey in the next birth ; another who did not give liberally to a brahmin became a fox.45 Clearly such tales have an ulterior motive. One anecdote says that Jamadagni Was playing with arrows which he kept shooting at greater and greater distances ; his wife Renukã was retrieving them for him. Once fatiguded with running about in the midday sun she was delayed ; he was angry, but on knowing that the sun was the reason of the delay he was about to curse the sun. The sun came down and gave him a white umbrella against the heat. " Hence gifts of umbrellas to brahmins yield merits. There are tediously long catalogues of gifts to be given to brahmins and also of what dividends such gifts yield in the next world. Thirtyfive whole chapters in the Anusãsanaparvan alone describe this.47 Not only gifts but daksinãs ( ritual fees ) also continued from the Ve- dic age, but in this Bhãrgava section they multiplied in arithmetical progre- ssion. The Purãnas represent the culmination of this tendency. Food, clothes, all the daily necessities of life, and of luxury goods, gold, cattle, chariots, land, slaves and women - if given in large enough quantities, fetch much merit here and hereafter. Maidens, married women with children and childless married girls figure in the lists of gift articles in shockingly large numbers. What the brahmin priest did with these women is another ques- tion. Here in the Bhãrgava section we hear for the first time of jãtí-brãh- mäna, a brahmin by birth alone. He is defined as a brahmin without meditation and without education.48 And even such a brahmin is worthy of wórship.49 The ksatriya is a warrior in the epic, but in overland trade the ksatriya accompanied the caravans as guards. Contemporaneous Buddhist literature portray ksatriyas as prosperous landed gentry. The vaišya had two vocations - agriculture and trade. The tradesman was frequently rich. Brahmins, Ksatriyas and rich Vaišyas constituted one social class. The early Jain text Angavijja mentions two classes - ajja and milakkhu, and at another place, ajja and pessa.50 Clearly, this is an economic class stratification : the pros- u patyabhave yatha stri hi devaram kurute patim / ãnantaryãt tatha ksatram prthivì kurute patim // XII. 73. 12 45 XII. 9. 46 XIII. 97. 47 64-96, 106,112. 48 tapahsrutãbhyftiii vihìno jatibrahmana^ èva sah / V. 1. 115 49 brahmano пата bhagavan janmaprabhrti рЩуаре II XII. 261. 12 50 ãrya i. е., gentlemen and servants.</page><page sequence="10">478 ÂBOkï : Àmriamahoîsava Voïumè perous class entrenched in power was arya or ajja, the rest were servants^ milakkhu ( mleccha ) or pessa ( presya ). Right from the Later Ve die texts the südra is a servant, frequently a slave, who served the three upper castes. This section of the epic says that Prajãpati created him as a servant for the other castes.51 The südra should serve the three upper castes without malice.52 Umbrellas, ointments, shoes, fans and clothes, when these are so old and torn that they are unusable, should be given away to the südra dãsa.6 J The slaves' wealth :an be freely used by his master.64 Yet, even within this framework some significant changes were setting in. With the introduction of iron ploughshares the area of arable land was stretching. The vaišya alone could not cultivate it, hence some südras were also tilling land, probably as share-croppers. Secondly, with the knowledge of monsoon winds available from the first century A D. and the introduction of the calendar, maritime trade became safer, so some vaišyas who could afford to invest, left the more strenuous job of agriculture to the šudra and went over to trade. Those who existed outside the social boundary of respecta- bility like the mleccha, candäla, pulkasa, švapaka, šavara and nisãda - all worked under the prosperous vaišya and südra. Manu, a spokesman of the Bhãrgava social values, calls these self-dependent südras.55 Society paid greater honour to brahmins who did not perform religious rituals for Südras and would not accept their gifts.56 Yet to officiate at Südras' rituals was occasionally quite lucrative. This dilemma was solved by cleverly dodging the issue, when Manu said that one could perform religious rites for the ť nyäyavartin ' ( righteous ) südra. And who is a nyäyavartin südra ? Medhã- tithi, a commentator on Manu says, ' one who offers the five great sacrifices.'57 This nyäyavartin Südra's period of ritual uncleanness at a death in the family was not a month, but only fifteen days. Clearly, concessions are being made on the ground of material prosperity : the rich šúdra is now climbing on the ladder of social hierarchy. The ordinary Südras, i. e. the majority of the südras, however, remained poor and downtrodden.

The Brhaspati Dharmasutrď 4 says that the südra merchant has to pay tax at the highest rate. So some südras were rich enough to pay taxes at the highest rate in cash. And then society would respect them. But the poor südra was no better than garbage.59 The Brahmãnda Purãna says that the king who has many südra subjects has many sections practising non-Vedic religions. n0 The Aitareya Brahmano, says that the Šavaras, Mütivas, Pundras and Ãndhras were the wayward sons of Visvämitra i. e. these are fallen ksatriyas. Thus the foreign invaders were being' socially assimilated and placed above the mlecchas ; they could offer the Vrätyastoma and become proper ksatriyas. So through the Vrãtyastoma, through hypergamy and through independent lucrative vocations some südras gained upward social mobility. The pre-Aryans were more deft and skilled in crafts, and so in many cottage industries; they had, therefore, been controlling these crafts from olden times. Thus manual labour was gradually looked down. The Bhãr- gava section says that if a brahmin plied these crafts and trades he will be regarded as a südra. Manu also says so.61 Society ranked the nobility among the invading people as Vrãtyaksatriyas, and this section of foreigners controll- ed political power. So, faced with this dilemma, 'the lawgivers changed their criterion : they elevated these foreigners to proper Ksatriyahood and worshipped them as royalty and the nobility. The episode of the wish-cow of Vašistha which at its master's crisis brought forth troops of foreigners, shows that the brahmins took the latter as their allies. The Bhãrgava section condemns caste mobility in unequivocal terms. It says that caste intermixture leads to destruction and it is a special and un- failing sign of the Kali yuga. The trauma of Kali is worked up characteri- stically in the Bhãrgava section. During the Kali age the südra will impart religious instruction and the brahmin will become a servant6 - and the südra will refuse to serve the brahmins/ 3 Another concomitant of the Kali age is that the wife will not obey the husband.64 Mãrkandeya instructs Yudhisthira : an irate brahmin curses a crane ; then he went to a house where the wife served food to her husband before entertaining the brahmin guest. As the brahmin was about to curse her she mocked him : 4 Am I a crane ?

Mãrka ndeya says that a devoted wife, patinata, will always eat the left-over from her husband's plate.65 Draupadî instructing Satyabhãmã on the duties of a wife, says, ' I serve my husbands in awe, as if they were angry serpents.'00 I never cross words with my husbands, never exceed them in any way, never retort to my mother-in- law.07 I serve the Pändavas together with their other wives.65 A woman should do good to her husband even at the cost of her own life/9 This is a good wife's duty. And the duty of a « sati ' Incidentally, the words satï and pativratã have no masculine synonyms in the same sense. So the du- ties are wholly unilateral. A woman marrying a second time commits a crime, but a man marry- ing many wives does no sin.70 The nymph Pañcacuda says to Närada that a woman is more given to sex enjoyment than men. We notice that a woman is made to say this, so as to give greater credence to the statement. Bhisma* lying on his bed of arrows, quite near his death twice says to Yudhisthira, that none is more sinful than a woman.71 He says that Antaka, Šamana,, Mrtyu, Pãtãla, the ocean-fire, a razor's blade, poison, serpent and fire, - a» woman is equal to all these together.72 The episode of the young princess Mãdhaví is an eye-opener. Galava, unable to pay his teacher's fees approa- ches king Yayäti who says that his treasury is depleted. In lieu of money he gives Gälava his pretty young daughter Mãdhaví whom Galava can hire out to three kings, one after the other, for a year each, to raise the necessary funds. Galava saw nothing wrong in this and does so.73 Education was forbidden for women.71 A woman must marry ; men are free not to. So Kunigarga's daughter, the old, saintly woman, had to marry and consu- mmate the marriage for one night before she could gain entrance in heaven.75 Krsna himself includes women in a list of sinners whom he can save.76 65 ucchistam bhunjate bhartuh sã ca nityam yudhisthira I III. 197. 12 66 aslvisan iva kruddhan patìn paricarãmy aham / III. 222. 34 b' aham patin natisaye natyasne natibhïïsaye f nâpi parivãde svasrûm sarvadU pariyantrita // III. 222. 36 sadaran pãndavan nityam pray atop acar amy aham / III. 222. 18 69 etad dhi paramatn naryah kãryam loke sanatanam / prãnãn api parity ajya y ad bhartrhitam ãcaret II I. 146. 4. na capy adharmah kalyûna bahupatnikafã nrnãm / strhidm adharmah sumahãn bhartuh pUrvasya lakghane/l I. 146. 34 71 na hi stribhyah param putra paplyah kincidasti vai / XIII. 40. 4 antakah samano tri rty uh pãtalam vadavãmukham / ksuradhãrã visam sarpo vahnir ity ekatah striyah // XIII. 38. 29 *3 V. 118-22, 74 nirindriyã amantrãs ca striyo f nrtam iti srutih / XIII. 40. 11 75 IV. 52. 1. щат hi pârtha vyapUsritýa ye 'pi yõnti parám gatitn / BhagavadgttfrV I. 33, 3?</page><page sequence="13">Bhattacharji : The Bhärgava interpolation of Mahabhärata 481 Following the husband in the funeral pyre is rare in the core epic ; widows live on. But in the Bhärgava section one or two exceptions are made ; at Vasudeva's death, Devakï, Bhadrä, Rohinï and Ma Jira die on their husband's pyre; at Krsna's death Satyabhämä, Rukminï and his other wives immolate themselves. The dove's wife in the Šantiparvan anecdote burns with her husband.77 But Gändhärl, Kuatî, Satyavatî and many other widows and war-widows live on without any social stigma. Herodotes says that the custom of ť Satî ' was prevalent among the Scythians. In the Eran pillar inscription King Gopavähana's queen climbs her husband's pyre. One of the main characteristics of the Bhärgava section is the social demotion of the woman. A Syrian author Bardosánes wrote his Book of the Laws of the Countries in 140 A. D. : there he says that the Kushans looked upon their wives as mistresses and did not demand sexual fidelity from them ; their wives courted even their servants. It is possible that in order to counter such influences the lawgivers tightened the fetters on women. But the Bhärgava section repeatedly condemns women per se, and lays down rules for their subjugation. Yet the earlier core epic section portrays many indepen- dent women who command respect. The Bhärgava section, however, needed to preach the subordination of women, hence the numerous episodes and didactic sections. In a late contemporary Gupta sculpture we see for the first time Laksmi massaging Näräyana's feet. From the fourth and third centuries B. C. some quite radical changes were introduced in society and in religious faith and practice. For all this there was not yet any scripture ; this proto-Puranic Bhärgava interpolation created that scripture. The core epic Jaya was begun the fourth century B. C. and completed possibly around the second / first century A. D. together with the first set of interpolation of the tales of perennial ethical values. The Bhärgava recension was begun soon after and was completed around the fourth century A. D. It is the creation of sectarian priests and is stylistically much inferior to the core epic, ornate, flabby, extensive and repetitive. After the Buddhist, Jain, Ajïvika and Upanisadic influences had dis- appeared, men lost faith in sacrifices, and the abstruse philosophy of the Upa- nisads was beyond the comprehension of the common man. So Agamic beliefs and practices of the indigenous people, possibly also of the non-Vedic Aryans living at the periphery of the society, resurged and slowly but steadily infiltrated the social and religious culture. To this was added the beliefs and customs of the invading tribes which introduced some more chaos to the already existing chaos of the paradigm of the social ethos of the day. The practices and faiths of the non-sacrificing people which had been banished or « XII. 144. 9. 61 Annals, BORI [ A.

So began the deification of the king, the theology of the sectarian religion, and the steady increase of the redoubtable socio-political and economic power of the priests. Then were invented the different facets of this new pu jã- based religion - with growing emphasis on temples, images, vows, pilgrimages and the ever-swelling ritual fees and charity to brahmins. Theories of rebirth and karman had been there for several centuries. Before, the forest teachers capitalized on their arcane knowledge of these doctrines which emerged in the Upanisadic times. Now a section of priests invented anecdote after anecdote to cash in on these theo- ries. Heaven, hell, ghost-lore, astrology, omenology - all played second fiddle to the notion of fatalism which was a corner-stone of this new religio- philosophical paradigm. It rendered the vision of life as enveloped in a mystery which priests alone could penetrate. The successive invasions of the Kushan, Šaka, Murunda, Pahlavas, Huns and Pãradas shook the sense of security, at least temporarily, and created an imbalance in society. Conservatism thrived in this chaos, and the prime targets of the priests who formulated these new values were the poor, the Südra, the slave - and the woman. Quite naturally, intermarriage grew rapidly over a vast area in northern India. The lawgivers raised a hue and cry over the threat to woman's chastity and the Sudra's subservience. Con- servative values, especially the caste laws - Varnadharma, were especially oppressive to the südra and the woman. The Kali age they portrayed was actually a picture of their contemporary society. Around this time mariti ve trade with Greece, Rome and the Middle East began to shrink, while trade with the Far East increased substantially. But this trade did not bring in any creative clash of ideas or any recognizable impact of new ideas. So a kind of narrow insularity set in. Around the fourth century B. C. the productive system, and production relations as well as class organization had assumed a stable form. Castes and subcastes were multiplying and the stratification was steadily getting ossified. Brahmins, rich Ksatriyas and the rich Vaišyas constituted the ruling mobility of the Aryas, while the poor Ksatriyas, poor Vaišyas, südras, mlecchas and antya- jas ( untouchables ) comprised the dãsavarna. In this class-and-caste-ridden society, ruled by brahmin priests and lawgivers, the people could be kept blind with superstitions iostered by the theories of rebirth and karman, with notions of fate, beliefs in Šraddha, obsequial, and expiatory rites. Texts on these subjects began to proliferate increasingly. But the first inception of all these are found in the Bhargava section of the epic. Their fruition and cul- mination appeared in the Pureas, Smr'is, Dharmasãstras and Nibandhas. What germinated first in the Bhargava interpolation of the Manãbhãrata later evolved into Hinduism. And here lies the true significance pf this interpo- lation,</page></plain_text>
