However, the measurements on cadaver are restrictive and the measurements on living human remain limiting. Moreover, in the literature, the predictive equations are mainly 2D and include two restraining assumptions. Accordingly, it is still challenging to obtain appropriate 3D BSIPs. A bi-planar radiographic method, previously developed to obtain personalized BSIPs, and adjusted scaling equations, recently developed to provide the 3D position of the center of mass and both moments and products of inertia, were compared and demonstrated the same mass distribution (although significant differences). The center of mass was slightly posterior and lateral, and the products of inertia were almost of the same order as the longitudinal moment of inertia. These data may be useful for researchers who would like to obtain appropriate 3D BSIPs. INTRODUCTION The Body Segments Inertial Parameters (BSIPs) are essential data in ergonomics, human movement analysis or dummy specifications [1-3]. However, the BSIPs measurements on cadavers [4-6] are restrictive and the measurements on living subjects remain limited. For instance, the measurements from gamma-scan [7] or DEXA [8] are 2D, the measurements from stereo- photogrammetry or video-scan [9-14] are external, and the measurements from MRI [15-17] or CT-scan [18] are expensive and time consuming (CT-scan also yield radiation considerations). Moreover, in literature, all the BSIP predictive equations based on the measurements mentioned above, (on cadaver or living subjects) assumed that the center of mass and the proximal and distal joint centers are aligned, and that the inertia tensor is principal in the segment axes. Some predictive estimations refer exclusively to a "transverse" moment of inertia [6, 19] and some predictive estimations follow segment endpoint definitions based on external landmarks [5, 7, 11, 12]. Therefore, these predictive equations are mainly 2D and become restrictive in 3D (e.g. in recent inverse dynamic methods [20-22]). In fact, it is still challenging to obtain appropriate 3D BSIPs, that is to say BSIPs applicable in the conventional Segment Coordinate Systems (SCS) and without restraining the center of mass and the principal axes of inertia. A bi-planar radiographic method has been previously developed in order to obtain personalized 3D BSIPs [23]. The bi-planar radiographic method is mainly used to obtain personalized 3D reconstructions of the skeleton [24, 25]. The access to 3D external shape in the same time as the skeleton allowed computing the BSIPs considering both bone tissue and soft tissue densities as well as computing the BSIPs (e.g. position of center of mass) with respect to the joint centers. The personalized BSIPs were found to compare favorably with several estimations from the literature [4, 6, 15, 26, 27]. Nevertheless, the frontal and sagittal positions of the center of mass and the products of inertia could not be compared. Additionally, adjusted scaling equations have been recently developed [28] on the basis of stereo- photogrammetric data from Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory [11, 12], These scaling equations dealt with the 3D position of the center of mass and with both moments and products of inertia, adjusted in 1165</page><page sequence="2">conventional SCS [29, 30]. These scaling equations demonstrated that the center of mass, the proximal and distal endpoints may be not aligned and demonstrated that the inertia tensor may be not principal in the segment axes. The objective of this study is to compare the bi-planar radiographic method and the adjusted scaling equations for the computation of 3D BSIPs of the Thigh segments of 16 adult males and females. METHODS SUBJECTS The subjects were recruited during the previous study on bi-planar radiographic method [23], They were 8 able- bodied males (mean age 27 years old, SD = 4) and 8 able-bodied females (mean age 26 years old, SD = 5). The mean height was 1 .77 m (SD = 0.03) for males and 1 .68 m (SD = 0.07) for females. The mean weight was 66 kg (SD = 7) for males and 60 kg (SD = 4) for females. Informed consent was obtained from each subject. BI-PLANAR RADIOGRAPHIC METHOD Frontal and sagittal calibrated numerical radiographs were taken at the Laboratoire de Biomécanique with the EOS™ system ( Biospace , Paris, France). The EOS™ system includes two X-ray sources and two numerical detectors. The 3D reconstructions of the Femur, Patella and Thigh (Figure 1) were obtained by bi-planar methods. These methods are based on the registration and deformation of 3D atlas models on 2D anatomical points and contours that are digitized in both radiographs [25]. The Thigh reconstruction was made to follow an anatomical segmentation [31]. Figure 1 . 3D reconstructions of the Femur, Patella and Thigh, segment coordinate system, position of the center of mass and segment length L The personalized BSIPs were then computed from their corresponding volumes considering average but distinct densities for bone and soft tissues. The densities of bone tissue and soft tissue were assumed to be Pbone = 1 -42 g/cm3, psoft = 1 03 g/cm3 for males and Psoft = 1 02 g/cm3 for females [32], The position of the center of mass and the inertia tensor were expressed in the conventional Thigh SCS [29]. The origin is the Hip Joint Center and the Y-axis is defined from Knee Joint Center to origin. The complete description of the method can be found in [23]. ADJUSTED SCALING EQUATIONS In the same Thigh SCS, the Thigh BSIPs were estimated through adjusted scaling equations. The adjusted scaling equations were established from stereo-photogrammetric data [11, 12], The study of McConville et al. [11] concerned 31 adult males and the study of Young et al. [12] concerned 43 adult females. From both studies, the adjustment procedure allowed computing the segment lengths based on joint centers as well as computing the BSIPs directly in the conventional SCS [29, 30]. For instance, the adjustment procedure for the Thigh included the estimation of the Hip Joint Center [33] from the external landmarks available in the stereo-photogrammetric data. The obtained scaling equations were the 3D position of the center of mass relative to the segment length and the moments and products of inertia ¡¡j relative to the segment length L and to the segment mass m, following the relation: r¡¡ = (1/L) x li¡¡ Im]112. Regarding, the moments of inertia, r¡¡ is the relative radius of gyration. The same relation is used for the products of inertia, but does not represent a radius of gyration. Also, r¡¡ may be an imaginary value when the inertia product is negative. Besides, the segment mass m is given relative to the total body mass M (without specific adjustment). The complete description of the adjustments can be found in [28]. The adjusted scaling equations for the Thigh are given in Table 1. Table 1.

The segment length L (from Hip Joint Center to Knee Joint Center) was directly taken from the Femur 3D reconstruction. 1166</page><page sequence="3">COMPARISON The BSIPs were also estimated with two classical scaling equations, using the same segment length L. However, these scaling equations of Dempster [6] and de Leva [27], are restraining the position of the center of mass and the orientation of the principal axes of inertia. Therefore, the frontal and sagittal positions of the center of mass were assumed to be zero, as well as the products of inertia. Moreover, in the scaling equations of Dempster [6], the same equations are used for both males and females and the lyy moment of inertia is set to zero. The personalized BSIPs were compared to the estimated BSIPs obtained by the three mentioned scaling equations [6, 27, 28]. Significant differences were assessed with ANOVA followed by Scheffé post hoc tests ( Statistica , StatSoft, US) on the 16 males and females. RESULTS SEGMENT MASS The mean segment masses are given in Figure 2. Figure 2. Mean segment mass (in kg) for the females (F) and the males (M) Significant differences (but with p &lt; 0.05) were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the adjusted scaling equations [28]. Moreover, no significant differences were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the scaling equations of de Leva [27] and no significant differences were found between the results from the adjusted scaling equations [28] and the scaling equations of de Leva [27], Conversely, all other differences were significant (p &lt; 0.001). 3D POSITIONS OF CENTER OF MASS The mean 3D positions of center of mass are given in Figure 3. Except with the scaling equations restraining its position [6, 27], the positions of the center of mass on the X and Z axes were found different from zero. Figure 3. Mean 3D position of the center of mass (in m) for the females (F) and the males (M) On the X axis , significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the adjusted scaling equations [28]. On the Y axis, significant differences (but with p &lt; 0.01) were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the adjusted scaling equations [28], Moreover, significant differences (but with p &lt; 0.05) were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the scaling equations of Dempster [6], On the Z axis, no significant differences were found between the results from the bi- planar radiographic method [23] and the adjusted scaling equations [28]. Conversely, all other differences were significant (p &lt; 0.001). MOMENTS AND PRODUCTS OF INERTIA The mean moments and products of inertia are given in Figure 4. Except with the scaling equations restraining the orientation of the principal axes of inertia [6, 27], the products of inertia were found different from zero. Figure 4. Mean moments and products of inertia (in Kg.m2) for females (F) and males (M) 1167</page><page sequence="4">For I,« and b, significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the adjusted scaling equations [28]. Besides, no significant differences were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the scaling equations of de Leva [27] and no significant differences were found between the results from the adjusted scaling equations [28] and the scaling equations of Dempster [6]. For lyy, significant differences (but with p &lt; 0.05) were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the adjusted scaling equations [28]. Additionally, significant differences (but with p &lt; 0.05) were found between the results from the adjusted scaling equations [28] and the scaling equations of de Leva [27], For Ixy, significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the adjusted scaling equations [28]. For Ixz and lyz, significant differences (but with p &lt; 0.01) were found between the results from the bi-planar radiographic method [23] and the adjusted scaling equations [28]. Conversely, all other differences were significant (p &lt; 0.001). DISCUSSION The scaling equations reported the literature cannot provide the estimation of the 3D position of the center of mass and of the complete inertia tensor due to two restrictive assumptions. Also, using measurements on living subjects, the access to appropriate 3D BSIPs is still challenging. In the current study, the bi-planar method and the adjusted scaling equations were used in order to obtain BSIPs directly in the conventional SCS and without restraining the position of the center of mass and the orientation of the principal axes of inertia. The bi-planar radiographic method has been previously compared to several scaling equations [4, 6, 15, 26, 27] and the obtained BSIPs were found to compare favorably [23]. It has been well established [23, 26, 34, 35] that the estimations using predictive equations or personalized measurements provide BSIPs differing by more than 40% (especially for the segment mass and the moments of inertia). This was attributed to the population investigated, the segmentation and the variation of the measurement method. For instance, in the bi-planar radiographic method, an average soft tissue density was used without differentiating between fat and muscle. Nevertheless, considering both bone tissue and soft tissue seems more rigorous than a simple segment density as proposed in stereo- photogrammetry [9-12], video-scan [13, 14] and mathematical models [36, 37]. In the current study, the comparison between the bi-planar radiographic method and the adjusted scaling equations (adjusted from stereo-photogrammetric data) shows significant differences, but with p &lt; 0.05 for the segment mass and the lyy moments of inertia, and significant differences with p &lt; 0.01 for the position of the center of mass on the Y axis. The comparison shows more significant differences, with p &lt; 0.001, for the lxx and moments of inertia. However, these differences remain in the range of the literature, considering the two classical scaling equations of Dempster [6] and de Leva [27], The frontal and sagittal positions of the center of mass and the products of inertia have not been previously compared because no scaling equation was available in the literature. That is why the adjusted scaling equations were recently developed [28]. In the current study, the comparison between the bi-planar radiographic method and the adjusted scaling equations shows no significant differences for the position of the center of mass on the Z axis. The comparison shows significant differences (but with p &lt; 0.01) for the I« and 'n products of inertia and, more significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) for the position of the center of mass on the X axis and the Ixy products of inertia. Nevertheless, the order of magnitude is consistent and the same trends were found. For instance, the center of mass was found slightly posterior and lateral with respect to the longitudinal axis. These findings were also coherent with a published cadaver study [4]. The influence of this mass distribution on the 3D multi- body (direct or inverse) dynamics should be further investigated. Furthermore, the current study is focused on the Thigh and the comparison should be extended to other segments. CONCLUSION BSIPs directly applicable in the conventional SCS and without restraining the position of the center of mass and the orientation of the principal axes of inertia could be obtained by the bi-planar radiographic method and the adjusted scaling equations. The BSIPs obtained for the Thigh were compared and demonstrated significant differences but within the range of the literature. Also, the BSIPs demonstrated the same mass distribution. For instance, the center of mass was found slightly posterior and lateral. This data may be useful for researchers who would like to obtain appropriate 3D BSIPs. REFERENCES [1] J. G. Reid and R. K.
