<plain_text><page sequence="1">LES MACHINES INFERNALES: THE FOCALIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN PAUL NIZAN'S ANTOINE BLOYÉ Michael West Machines dominate the world into which the hero of Paul Nizan's Antoine Bloyé (1933) is born. In the late 19th century, the arrival of the railroad at last links Paris to the Atlantic port of St. Nazaire and thus more efficiently to the Americas. Like so many other young men around him, Antoine cannot help but find himself caught up in the frenzy of construction, dazzled by the sudden appearance of rumbling cities on plains where tiny villages once stood and the almost magical appearance of dockyards, warehouses, and bustling ports where only a short while earlier lay a string of sleepy fishing communities. Seeing only the effects of industrialization, Antoine ignores the process of industrialization itself, a process requiring both physical and human capital in order to perpetuate its own existence. The biography of Antoine Bloyé, station master and dutiful railroad employee, is the story of a man who fails to realize that he has been educated as part of a newly-created class, a middle-management technocracy whose function is to ensure the continued expansion of industry. The novel Antoine Bloyé narrates the way in which this new class, to which the hero belongs only as an infinitely replaceable member, is created seemingly ex nihilo. With the ideological overde- termination typical of the roman à thèse, the narrator 'explains' the various traps laid for the hero which render his ultimate downfall inevitable. This technique reveals itself most clearly in the novel's problematic focalization, in which the narrator's ideology ultimately supplants the hero's.</page><page sequence="2">1 86 ROMANCE NOTES Technology, of course, plays a pivotal role in the industrial process. While in a socialist-realist novel such as Antoine Bloyé we might expect to find the virtues of technology extolled, from the novel's opening we find Technology, for which the railroad stands metonymically, described in seductive and sinister tones. The rails lure young men from the family farm with illusory promises of freedom and mobility and quite literally carry them away on "le chemin de fer [qui] s'insinue dans ces bouts du monde [la Bretagne]" (36).' As part of the human capital required for the growth of industry, the young Bloyé is drawn unwittingly into the industrial process by his enthusiasm for the explosive growth of physical capital, the other term of the equation. Physical capital appears most noticeably in the form of mechanical inventions and seemingly unbridled industrial growth: Plus d'un garçon de la campagne est attiré par le halètement des locomotives au corps de cuivre, par ces abeilles de métal bourdonnant sur le tablier des nouveaux ponts de fer (37). . . . Antoine Bloyé tombait à quatorze ans au centre de cette ville [St. Nazaire] qui se haussait et s'agitait de son mieux au-dessus de la plaine lisse . . . [I]l était entraîné par la croissance de cette ville. (54) The city exerts its own gravitational pull on young Antoine, a force which proves irresistible when coupled with the compelling example given by the male adult world: "Les hommes mûrs s'aban- donnaient à l'ivresse de construire . . . Comment un garçon de quinze ans eût-il pu résister à cette exaltation industrielle qui saisis- sait les grandes personnes?" (54). The alternative to this frenzied activity, the "faibles vitesses agricoles" and the "demi-sommeil des champs" which characterize Antoine's native Brittany, can hardly compete for the young man's attention. As the narrator explicitly states: "L'indifférence, la passivité paysannes qu'il avait d'abord absorbées par tous les pores sous les arbres . . . s'évanouissaient à chaque mise en marche de moteur" (55). Thus Antoine's very first impulse is to become a part of this new world. Entry, however, comes only after payment of the price of admission: in this case, passage through the formal, institutionalized 1 Page numbers refer to the Grasset edition of 1933.</page><page sequence="3">"LES MACHINES INFERNALES" 1 87 educational system of the collège. The collège marks Antoine's first contact with others his own age. In the same sort of competitive milieu which Nizan himself came to know at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and later attacked in Les Chiens de garde (1932), this interaction marks the beginning of a class consciousness which the hero will never fully form for himself but will sense only vaguely throughout the novel. The narrator-focalizer, on the other hand, possesses a perfect knowledge of the class structure into which Antoine falls and apprises the reader regularly of this fact. Unaware of the full implications of this relative handicap, An- toine discovers his own scholastic talents and earns provisory admis- sion into the adult world to which he aspires. By the end of his last year at collège, he wins not only all the annual prix but a scholarship as well, to study at the prestigious Ecole des Arts et Métiers in Angers. Ironically, Antoine's successes at collège earn him the respect of his parents but at the same time provide him with the first percep- tion of the distance which separates him from their world: Antoine se demandait s'il avait réellement lieu d'être fier, si ce succès de collège signifiait quelque chose pour sa vie à venir . . . Antoine pense soudain que sa mère ne sait pas écrire, qu'elle lit seulement les caractères d'imprimerie mais non les lettres manuscrites, qu'elle prononce de travers les mots compliqués, . . . elle emploie des mots patois de son pays gallo, ... et cela fait rire les gens des villes . . . Ainsi Antoine commence à éprouver . . . que le monde vers lequel ses études le poussent, où l'entraîne une naïve ambition est assez loin du monde où depuis leur jeunesse ont vécu ses parents, il sent un commencement de séparation, il n'est plus exactement de leur sang et de leur condition, il souffre déjà comme d'un adieu, comme d'une infidélité sans retour. (62-63) Having left the "sillon terrien où il avait germé" for the collège in St. Nazaire, Antoine now prepares to leave the region entirely, for more specialized schooling in a different, larger and more distant city, Angers. The lesson that Antoine will take with him from St. Nazaire consists of a conception of the world (or 'ideology' in its broad sense of Weltanschauung) and particularly a conception of power organized entirely along the lines of industry: Un Antoine Bloyé, à seize ans, n'est plus capable de concevoir les actions d'un homme que sous les apparences industrielles qui dominent l'âge dangereux où son adoles-</page><page sequence="4">188 ROMANCE NOTES cence se déroule . . . Dans St. Nazaire, les titres magiques d'ingénieur, d'ingénieur en chef ouvrent toutes les portes; ces mots expriment complètement l'idée qu'Antoine peut se faire de l'importance et de la puissance véritables. (S6-S7) The lessons Antoine has failed to learn from St. Nazaire, how- ever, will have serious effects on his future. Entry into the Ecole des Arts et Métiers is represented (and appears) to Antoine as a privilege, a reward for past achievement enhanced by a bourse. Undertaking a specialized field of study in railroad engineering, Antoine unwittingly fulfills the demands placed by capitalism on labor for an increasingly specialized work force. Specialization breeds further alienation, from the industrial process conceived as a whole, from fellow workers, and ultimately from the individual laborer himself. Antoine's path illustrates Lu- kács's remark in History and Class Consciousness: that "[Rationali- sation is unthinkable without specialization ... As labour is progres- sively rationalized and mechanized his [the laborer's] lack of will is reinforced by the way in which his activity becomes less and less active and more and more contemplative" (89). When focussed on the machine, this contemplation takes on a progressively more obsessive character, to the point where the individual can represent his environment to himself only in mechan- ical terms: "[Antoine] disait ďun homme qui boit: 'Il a un giffard qui fonctionne bien,' d'une femme enceinte: 'Elle a gondolé sa plaque avant d'enveloppe' " (129). In one of the most dramatic moments of the novel, a derailment kills two locomotive engineers. Antoine focalizes the derailed locomotive "comme un cadavre sans figure, où la forme humaine s'est déchirée," and part of a human corpse "comme un morceau de marbre" (132). The métonymie confusion of the human and the mechanical, as well as the interpénétration of the animate and the inanimate, preoccupies the narrator to such a degree that ultimately even Bloyé's past can be read only under the sign of the machine. In the following passage, the narrator relates the hero's military service at age 21, between the Ecole des Arts et Métiers and his entry into the railroad: Dans ces années-là [1885], les casernes n'étaient pas encore les grandes usines de guerre d'aujourd'hui où des adolescents écrasés de fatigue servent des machines mortelles qui préparent la mort avec une propreté de chaise électrique. (79-80)</page><page sequence="5">"LES MACHINES INFERNALES" 1 89 Here, not only are the already-reified casernes described as usines , but adolescents like Bloyé are écrasés, smashed, melted down and re-formed as cogs in the machine infernale of war. This passage reveals more than the narrator's obsession with mechanical metaphors, however. The d'aujourd'hui suddenly inter- rupts the diegetic time, bringing the reader forward to the 'present of narration'. As readers, we know very little about when the story of Bloyé's life is told, except that it is sometime after his death which opens and closes the novel. With d'aujourd'hui, the narrator inter- rupts the story of Bloyé's life to make the distinction between the military 'then' (1885) and the military 'now'. The difference between the two is the intervening period of industrialization and the trans- formation of the army into the 'present' (or current) war machine. Bloyé could not possibly possess the requisite knowledge and thus the narratorial authority to make such a distinction. Besides the indeterminate nature of the time of narration, the reader is likewise clueless as to the identity of the narrateur. It is Bloyé's son Pierre who generates the récit by asking the question, necessarily of the narrateur, "En somme, quel homme était donc mon père?" (30). 2 Clearly Pierre could not be asking himself the question, since he could not have access to the number and nature of details of his father's life which the narrator recounts. Nor could the narrative be a sort of voix d'outretombe, as neither Bloyé's level of class consciousness nor that of his wife Anne ever approaches that of the narrator's. Pierre's significance to the novel is reinforced by the novel's structure itself. Divided into 22 chapters, the second half of the novel begins with Chapter 12: "En 1905, pour la deuxième fois, un enfant [Pierre] naît dans la maison d'Antoine Bloyé . . . C'est un jour situé au centre de l'hiver," in the same way that Pierre's birth appears at the physical center of the novel. Here the biographical component begs commentary: Nizan himself was born in 1905, as both Jacqueline Leiner and W. D. Redfern, among others, have noted (Leiner, Le Destin littéraire de Paul Nizan; Redfern, Paul Nizan: Committed Literature in a Conspiratorial World). 1 The novel's destinataire would be le peuple or la société in the larger sense, of which Pierre is also a member.</page><page sequence="6">190 ROMANCE NOTES The narrator does in fact possess a degree of class consciousness and an ideological orientation very similar to those of the real author Paul Nizan. This similarity has unfortunate implications for those interpretations which insist on the strict separation of author and narrator. While this distinction often holds true, in the case of Antoine Bloyé it becomes quite difficult to argue the existence of a narrator significantly distinct from the author. Throughout nearly the entire work, the extradiegetic narrator is also the focalizer. The narrator becomes so accustomed to his own ideological orientation that in those rare passages in which focaliza- ron shifts to the hero, the reader is suddenly confronted with an ideology that seems ill-fitting to a hero of Bloyé's background. The ideological orientation of the narrator-focalizer displays a relatively sophisticated class consciousness compared to that of Bloyé, who has at best only a vague sense that the "correct" action or interpretation of an action necessarily involves identification and solidarity with the proletariat (designated consistently as les ouvriers j. Two repre- sentative passages serve to illustrate the confusion which exists between narrator and hero on the ideological plane: Il [Antoine] détestait alors les ouvriers, parce qu'il les enviait en secret, parce qu'il savait au plus profond de lui-même qu'il y avait plus de vérité dans leur défaite que dans sa victoire de bourgeois. (210) Aux ateliers, les ouvriers croyaient de toutes leurs forces que le socialisme empêcherait la guerre Le 31 juillet [1914], Antoine acheta l'Humanité, comme pour trouver une raison d'espoir, il devinait que la seule voix capable de vérité se faisait entendre là. (234) (my italics) In the first passage, the expressions en secret and au plus profond de lui-même in no way imply that Antoine verbalizes these thoughts to himself, but rather suggest a narratorial focalization rather crudely projected onto the hero. Likewise, in the second passage, the expres- sions comme pour and devinait suggest neither clear perception nor an articulation on the part of the hero of the ideological component of his choices or thoughts. Again, the narrator-focalizer rather clumsily projects its own ideology onto the hero. This problematizes the use of mechanical and industrial met- aphors in an interesting, albeit unresolved, way. In those passages</page><page sequence="7">"LES MACHINES INFERNALES" 1 9 1 where the focalizer is Bloyé himself, the use of a mechanical metaphor is very often consistent with and appropriate to a hero who has been socialized to view the world in such a way. Thus the abeilles de métal which fascinate the young Antoine (37) give rise to a confusion quite natural for someone who has never seen a locomotive before: a new phenomenon explained in terms of a familiar image. Likewise, a station master with years of experience in the railroad might conceivably describe a derailed locomotive viewed in darkness as a disfigured cadaver and could even confuse part of a real corpse with a piece of marble (132). Problems arise, however, when focalization reverts back to the narrator, as is often the case. The use of mechanical or industrial metaphors seems forced or at the very least betrays a distinct narratorial ideology which is suggestively and falsely portrayed as one which is shared by the hero. For example, the description of the barracks as les grandes usines de guerre and of soldiers as des machines mortelles qui préparent la mort clearly indicate a deter- minism on the part of the narrator which spills onto the hero's ideological plane. At its stylistic worst, the ideology of the narrator- focalizer resonates as little more than propaganda when compared to the relatively naïve world view of the hero: Tout encourageait alors la jeunesse ouvrière, les descendants ambitieux des artisans, des petits fonctionnaires à entrer dans le complot du commandement; Antoine y avait été entraîné comme les autres et il ignorait tout des ressorts qui tendaient cette grande entreprise, il ne savait pas qu'il faisait partie avec bien ďautres adolescents de son âge un des enjeux de la vaste partie que commençait à engager les principaux maîtres de la bourgeoisie française . . . l'industrie réclamait de nouveaux matériaux humains. (68) All "authoritarian fictions" and particularly the roman à thèse operate in this manner. The narrator's obsession with 'telling all' is symptomatic of the desire to ensure that the thèse of the roman à thèse is communicated with the least possibility of misunderstanding or 'rewriting.'3 More than perhaps any other genre, the roman à thèse presents itself as eminently lisible as opposed to scriptible, to use Barthes' famous paradigm outlined in S/Z (10-12). 3 Susan Suleiman discusses this problem in her Authoritarian Fictions 150.</page><page sequence="8">192 ROMANCE NOTES The world of Antoine Bloyé, like that of Drieu la Rochelle's Gilles, is a Manichean one. The narrator makes the 'correct' choice obvious for the reader, all too often with unnerving redundancy. What may be obvious to the reader of the roman à thèse, however, is not necessarily clear to the novel's hero. Ideological fiction of the period displays a curious dichotomy or split along political lines. Socialist-realist novels such as Antoine Bloyé, Aragon's communist novel Aurèlien and Nizan's later Cheval de Troie (1935) all portray heroes who fail to understand what the narrator makes abundantly clear to the reader, namely that 'correct' action necessarily involves commitment to the proletariat. Fascistic narratives such as Drieu's Gilles or Joseph Goebbels's Michael (1929) offer heroes who begin as equally incompetent readers of their own life narratives but who ultimately benefit from some sort of epiphany (a Nazi rally, the Fascist riots in Paris of February 6, 1934) to make the 'correct' choice which the narrator has already made explicit throughout the novel. Narrators and readers of ideological fiction benefit from a competency which fictional heroes can never enjoy, primarily due to a difference in class consciousness and a more privileged view of History. The hero's limited sense of class consciousness prevents him from grasping the 'larger picture' which the narrator presents to the reader so frequently. Hence the vaguely felt sensation on the part of Bloyé that his ideology is a false one and that the 'correct' orienta- tion lies with the working class. The narrator of Antoine Bloyé suggests that the hero's vague (and thus imperfect) sense of the legitimacy and primacy of the working class represents an unconscious desire on the hero's part to unite with that class. Since the hero never verbalizes this desire (because he is never fully conscious of it), he will often transfer this desire to the machines which surround him. The socialist or communist hero's contact with and even fondness for the machines with which he works represents a displaced longing for a social bond which is unconscious and ultimately impossible. The narrator's use of what I have designated as 'industrial' or 'mechanical' metaphors in Antoine Bloyé serves at least two differ- ent functions. The first describes the interpénétration of man and machine and indicates the extent to which machines are fetishized and even eroticized, as in the following passages:</page><page sequence="9">"LES MACHINES INFERNALES" 1 9 3 Toute machine est comme un être, elle a ses mœurs, ses facilités, ses résistances et ses caprices. [...] Une longue familiarité de la machine et de l'équipe produisait enfin une sorte de fidélité, de mariage: il fallait patiemment pénétrer ce grand animal noir et jaune, réticent comme une personne. (99) L'homme n'est-il donc qu'un meneur de machines? (144) The fetishization of machines is hardly limited to the socialist- realist novel, of course. Fascist or protofascist movements like the Italian Futurists were among the most notable machine fetishists. Alice Kaplan quotes F. T. Marinetti in her recent Reproductions of Banality : Fascism , Literature and French Intellectual Life on the Great French Railway Strike (1910), which incidentally represents the turning point of Antoine Bloyé : One can say of the Great French Railway Strike that the organizers were unable to persuade a single mechanic to sabotage his locomotive. To me this seems entirely natural. How could one of these men have been able to wound or kill ... his beautiful steel machine that had so often glowed with pleasure beneath his ardent caress? (90) Perhaps the best-known and most notorious fetishization of loco- motives in modern French literature can be found in Zola's La Bête humaine. The hapless Jacques Lantier, near death following the derailment caused by the spurned Flore, momentarily regains con- sciousness and looks about him: Enfin, Jacques ouvrit les paupières. Ses regards troubles se portèrent sur elles [Séverine et Flore], tour à tour, sans qu'il parût les reconnaître. Elles ne lui importaient pas. Mais ses yeux ayant rencontré, à quelques mètres, la machine qui expirait, s'effarèrent d'abord, puis se fixèrent, vacillants d'une émotion croissante. (318) Lantier does in fact focalize the derailed locomotive, la Lison, in the same anthropomorphic terms in which Bloyé focalizes the derailed locomotive in the passage previously cited.4 After Flore 4 The full passage from La Bête humaine: "La géante éventrée [la Lison] s'apaisa encore, s'endormit peu à peu d'un sommeil très doux, finit par sç taire. Elle était morte. Et le tas de fer, d'acier et de cuivre, qu'elle laissait là, ce colosse broyé, avec son tronc fendu, ses membres épars, ses organes meurtris, mis au plein jour, prenait l'affreuse tristesse d'un cadavre humain, énorme, de tout un monde qui avait vécu et d'où la vie venait d'être arrachée, dans la douleur" (3 1 8).</page><page sequence="10">1 94 ROMANCE NOTES throws herself in front of a train shortly after causing the derailment which nearly kills Lantier, her corpse, focalized by the railroad workers, is described "d'une blancheur de marbre" (325). Signif- icantly, this fetishizing process, whereby locomotive engines are transformed into the objects of male desire, is limited strictly to one sex. None of the female characters eroticizes machinery like their male counterparts. In both the examples of Nizan and Zola, the fetishization of locomotives presents a variation of the triangular structure of desire outlined by René Girard in his Deceit , Desire and the Novel Instead of portraying the obsession with locomotives as a displaced erotic desire, Nizan rewrites Zola's theme to depict the preoccupation with machines as symptomatic of a displaced social desire. 5 Besides demonstrating the fetishization and eroticization of ma- chines by men, the second function of the mechanical or industrial metaphor is to serve as an index of the degree to which the hero is alienated from his family, co-workers and the process of industrial- ization taken as a whole. By coming to represent his environment to himself in purely mechanistic terms, Bloyé illustrates Marx's point that with industrialization, interpersonal relations become increas- ingly mediated by objects and commodities. Men and women no longer relate to each other directly but rather through things. As Lukács points out in "Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat": [T]he mechanical disintegration of the process of production into its components also destroys those bonds that had bound individuals to a community in the days when production was still 'oiļganic'. In this respect, too, mechanisation makes of them isolated abstract atoms whose work no longer brings them together directly and organically; it becomes mediated to an increasing extent exclusively by the abstract laws of the mechanism which imprisons them. (History and Class Consciousness 90) Marx's own comments in The Poverty of Philosophy are even more explicit: 5 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's formulation of "homosocial desire" (as distinct from homosexual desire) in her Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire is, among other things, a reinterpretation of Girard's triangular structure of desire, as she admits in Ch. 1. As applied to Antoine Bloyé, both the term and the analysis are indeed appropriate.</page><page sequence="11">"LES MACHINES INFERNALES" 1 9 5 Through the subordination of man to the machine the situation arises in which men are effaced by their labour; in which the pendulum of the clock has become as accurate a measure of the relative activity of two workers as it is of the speed of two locomotives. Therefore, we should not say that one man's hour is worth another man's hour, but rather that one man during one hour is worth just as much as another during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing; he is at the most the incarnation of time. Quality no longer matters. Quantity alone decides everything: hour for hour, day for day...6 The tragedy of Antoine Bloyé, then, narrativizes the development of industrialization as a process by which relations with machines and objects come to mediate and ultimately replace social relations between human beings. The result of this alienation is an inability to, as Lukács puts it, "look beyond the divisive symptoms of the economic process to the unity of the total social system underlying it." 7 As a pure product of industrialization,8 Bloyé cannot grasp nor can be expected to grasp this "total social system" of capitalism. At the diegetic level, this synthesis is made by the narrator for the benefit of the narratee, Bloyé's son Pierre, who will reappear in Le Cheval de Troie to avenge his father. At the extradiegetic level, this lesson is explicated for the benefit of the implied reader, the nascent socialist-communist class, whose own narrative program forms an entirely different récit. Carnegie Mellon University 6 Quoted by Lukács in History and Class Consciousness 89. 7 "The superior strength of true, practical class consciousness lies in the ability to look beyond the divisive symptoms of the economic process to the unity of the total social system underlying it. In the age of capitalism it is not possible for the total system to become directly visible in external phenomena. For instance, the economic basis of a world crisis is undoubtedly unified and its coherence can be understood. But its actual appearance in time and space will take the form of a disparate succession of events in different countries at different times and even in different branches of industry in a number of countries." "Class Consciousness", History and Class Consciousness 74. 8 Paradoxically, while Bloyé's labor is part of the input of the industrial process, he himself is equally its product or output: anonymous, alienated and infinitely replaceable both as a supplier of labor and as a commodity consumer.</page><page sequence="12">196 ROMANCE NOTES Works Cited Barthes, Roland.
