THE new book of Bergson entitled Mind-Energy, although a collection of Essays and Lectures, all of which have pre- viously appeared in philosophical journals, is likely in one respect at least to rank among his most important works. It 'not only propounds to the student of philosophy a new concept of reality, a concept which identifies it with life and mind in the place of the old concept of something (it might be material or it might be spiritual) on which life and mind depend, and by which they are conditioned, but also it indi- cates as the corollary of that new concept a working principle of the highest scientific importance. In one of the studies in particular, it offers us an actual practical illustration of the application of this principle. I refer to the remarkable essay, which is really a scientific research on " Memory of the Pre- sent and False Recognition ". We are accustomed to think of psychology as the latest comer into the circle of the exact sciences, but there has arisen ambong us a new psychology of which the new psycho- logists of a very few years ago hardly dreamed, a science of unconscious mind. It threatens a complete revolution in our ordinary concepts of the mind and an entirely new basis for the science of it. I do not claim for Bergson that he is the discoverer or the pioiieer of this science, but he was one of the first to feel the direction of the new science and to indicate -the method of pursuing it, and his philosophical concept and principle are completely vindicated in its success. In claiming for Bergson -the discovery of a new concept I do not mean that the concept is new in the sense that it is 1</page><page sequence="2">H. WILDON CARR: not to be found implicitly in his' historical predecessors or generally in contemporary philosophy. I do mean that in his philosophy a concept of reality has found expression which completely alters the standpoint and direction of philosophical research and holds out the promise of a vast extension of knowledge, an extension into a domain which physical science has so far never attempted to conquer. In a word it opens the prospect of psychical science. The new concept is- that life is identical with reality and that consciousness is identical with life. Now the great problem of the past has been to define the nature of consciousness, explain its genesis, and determine its relation to the external reality which conditions it. If we accept the new concept the problem of the future is to explain the nature and genesis of unconsciousness. L Let me illustrate what I mean by referring to what will prob- ably be allowed to be the most original application of the con- cept-the theory of Creative Evolution. According to the generally accepted biological hypothesis, life appeared on our planet at first in an extremely simple and lowly form (whether it was a direct consequence of the growing complexity of mole- cular structure in certain forms of inert matter, or whether it was introduced entirely from without, is in the present state of our science uncertain). Once installed it has gone on produc- ing new forms, each responding to the conditions of the en- vironment by some special adaptation. Its highest achievement is the human brain with its accompaniment of self-conscious mind. There need be no dispute about facts. If we could be satisfied with description there would be no more to be said. Theproblem however which baffles the naturalist at every stage is to explain the driving force of evolution, to discover in the old, and therefore simpler, forms the efficient cause of new and highly specialised forms. The theories of natural selection, survival of the fittest, transmission by heredity of acquired characteristics, are helpful and valuable in their way, but entirely useless to throw light on the problem. Why is there growing complexity ? Why does complexity of structure en- tail higher function? How from the simple can come the complex and from the less the more? Compare now the theory of Creative Evolution. According to this theory, life is consciousness by nature and in right. Consciousness is not something more than life, an acquisition or addition to it. Let us leave out of account, as not affecting this question, Bergson's theory that matter is the inverse of life, in order to see his application of the concept of life to the biological problem as ordinarily understood. We have then as in the boilogical theory of evolution a first &amp;ppearance of life on the</page><page sequence="3">THE CONCEPT OF MIND-ENERGY. 3 planet in a lowly form. Life in Bergson's view has humbled itself in order to insert itself. By. what means has life, which is consciousness in right, achieved this lowly form which the initial effort required? By clothing itself, as it were, with unconsciousness, that is, by contriving artifices and mechan- isms which inhibit consciousness. Of course this is ex- pressed in anthropomorphic terms,-how else can we express any meaning? Once seize the concept, however, and we find we are possessed of a principle which really works. We can explain the evolution of life, or at least we cani study its process and its progress, without the dissatisfaction which haunts us when we are conscious of a suppressed paradox and direct logical contradiction. According to the new concept, when some new form of activity is called for, requiring for its attainment some new mode of consciousness, the life impulsion has not to devise for its outlet some new construction of a definitely shaped matter, which in some mysterious way will acquire, by the new combination alone, some new function, a function distinct from anything implicit in the elements themselves,-all it has to do is to remove a shutter, alter or adapt a mechanism, admit to consciousness some part of life previously excluded, make the new form of activity unconscious of everything which might distract it from the new purpose. Evolution can proceed thus because consciousness and life are universal reality, an activity within which and of which we are centres formed to effect actions; because reality is not a static, inert sphere of activity, inde- pendent of us and limiting us; because in consciousness we are not aware of something opposed to us and independent; because, in short, mind is energy not stuff. It is our restric- tion to definitely formed actions which gives to nature its objective aspect. From this concept of mind-energy there follows naturally a new concept of knowledge, and with it the problem of knowledge, as it has been presented throughout the contro- versy betwveen realist and idealist, is completely transformed. It is clear that if we conceive life itself as reality, conscious- ness as identical with life, and unconsciousness as the positive means by which life brings about its concentration in individual acting centres, then discernment of an independent reality is meaningless, and the faculty of knowing cannot be a faculty of contemplating and discrimxinating alien existence. The problem of how we come to know an independent objective world of nature, and the sceptical dilemma in regard to it, disappear. A new but entirely different problem arises, and at least this new problem is not foredoomed to sterility</page><page sequence="4">4 H. WILDON CARR: by the very terms in which it has to be stated. The new problem is to discover how and why the enduring, unceasingly acting, reality, life, is focussed in individual centres, and by what means and for what purpose the aspect of a reality essentially fluent is made to appear that of a static, immobile, alien, opposing reality. It hardly needs pointing out to any- one familiar with the direction of recent physics that this problem is not purely metaphysical; it has an important and intimate relation to physical science. I think the best way in which I can present this new concept and new working principle is by taking as the illustrative example of it Bergson's theory of perception and memory as expounded in his Matie're et Mermoire. The perception of objects is, according to this theory, a .selection of images,-a selection effected by shutting out in unconscious oblivion the whole of reality unconcerned with the living actions we are performing, or rather with the kind of influence we exercise. The outline and boundaries of objects,-the things we perceive,-demarcate lines alongwhich our present progressing action is forming. The selected images accordingly outline a certain eventuality of action. Selection of images does not mean that there is an act of the iind, such as some philosophers name the act of perceiving, which out of a variety of images actually present- pays atten- ;tion to some and disregards the rest. Neither does the term image mean that there are mental objects representative of real objects. Very different is Bergson's concept. In perceiving we are directly and immediately conscious or aware of reality, the images neither intercept our view nor mediate our view, they are constituted images by the selection, and the selection is determined by the form of our actions, and these by the needs, the range, and the mode of the activity. - This principle of selection interprets memory of the past as well as perception of the present. Memory is awareness of the past as present reality. The reality is past only in the sense that it is accomplished action. It is not past in the sense that it does not now exist. We carry it with us, it is what we are, our very selves, it is determined and also it is determining the form of our progressing coming action. The present loses all meaning if we cut it off from the past, because all reality is history, and history is making- itself. The past is wholly existent in the present, it constitutes each individual experience, it constitutes the racial experience, it &lt;onstitutes the evolution of life. It is with us always, an ever-present spiritual existence. It lies behind us and we</page><page sequence="5">THE CONCEPT OF MIND-ENERGY. 5 are unconscious of it, because life requires that our attitude be continuously, even strenuously, forward-looking. We are fixed in this attitude of attention to life. Nevertheless this very attention to life and the action it calls for requires the service of the past as well as its impulsion. At every moment of present perception the shutter is drawn aside according to the needs of the situation and then memory-images come to consciousness. They appear framed and with distinct out- lines, but their sharpness and discontinuity and individuality are due to selection. As in the selection of the perceived images, then, so also in the selection of the memory-images, unconsciousness and not consciousness is the active agent and plays the determining role. The reality is always present and we become conscious of it whenever the mechanisms of unconsciousness are relaxed or their working inhibited. The memory-image does not stand for the past or itntercept our view of it, it is formed by selection. It is not a special kind of thing preserving the past, stored in the brain, as we might keep the photograph of a friend in a drawer, it is a vision of the past which is sweeping on with us in our present activity, vision made possible by removing a veil. In the essay on " Memory of the Present and False Recog- nition," to which I have referred, we have an admirable example of the actual application of this concept and principle to a definite, ultra-scientific, psychological problem. Recognition offers one of the most obstinate problems in epistemology as everyone familiar with the history of theory of knowledge knows. In a sense indeed the whole of theory of knowledge is concentrated in it, and could we propose a really satisfactory solution of the problem of recognition one chapter in the history of philosophy would be closed. Recog- nition is what gives to present perceptual experience the feeling of familiarity which accompanies it whether it be routine or. entirely novel. The feeling admits of varying degree, but were it entirely absent consciousness itself would disappear. Recognition, when we analyse it, seems a complex thing-the association of a present fact with a present idea of past fact. The association is not arbitrary as in constructive imagination but appears as dependent on some actual relation between the present fact and the past fact ideally present. The laws of the association of ideas have therefore occupied philosophers from the beginning of philosophy. They are supposed to rest fundamentally on the objective fact that there is iesemblance between past sense experience and present sense experience, and on the subjective</page><page sequence="6">6 H. WILDON CARR: fact that memory of past experience is retained in con- sciousness in' an ideal form. Recognition therefore is generally regarded as an act of comparison comprehending a judgment so rapid that it enters consciousness as an immediate association. But what is common to every theory of association is the distinction between perception, which is fact, and memory, which is idea. We have, that is to say, perception of the present and memory of the past, and the opposite notions, perception of the past and memory of the present are a paradox. Both these paradoxical notions are declared by Bergson to be fact, and they are paradoxical only because we fail to understand what the past and the present are. But Bergson is not content to expose logical fallacies or to play with dialectic. Construction *which is purely metaphysical is, he says, "usually a fragile thing " (Mind-Energy, p. 58). He is never satisfied with any theory unless he can bring to its elucidation some concrete fact of living experience. This is wWhat he attempts to do in the essay to which I am referring. The false recognition which is analysed is not a mistaken resemblance but a distinct phenomnenon which has been de- scribed and verified and carefully recorded by psychologists, many 'of them medical practitioners. It is an abnormal phe- nomenon of mental pathology, in its very severe form it may be a symptom of on-coming insanity. The recorded cases, with full references, are given in the beginning of the essay. They are exhaustive up to the time when the essay was written, though doubtless there are many since. It is not an uncommon phenomenon, neither is it necessarily symptomatic. Many people can testify to having at some time experienced, gener- ally very briefly and under exceptional conditions, something closely analogous. The phenomenon is that the patient seems to himself to be remembering what he is actually perceiving, so that he is bewildered with the feeling that he is going through what he has already gone through, that his present experience has nothing new in it, he knows it already. He feels that he has seen what he is seeing and not that he is seeing what he has formerly seen. He has memory of the present instead of the normal memory of the past. If Bergson had had no- theory, if the ordinary concepts of perception and memory and the ordinary concept of reality on which they are based had not been suspect, he would piobably have seen no more in this phenomenon than a more or less curious instance of a strange delusion. In the light of his new concept it became at once significant. Suppose our krnowledge and its modes have been brought into being</page><page sequence="7">THE CONCEPT OF MIND-ENERGY. E by the needs of our activity, fashioned by the evolution of contrivances and mechanisms-which canalise the impulse of life, then it will be in cases of derangement or miscarriage, where the mechanisms are out of gear, Where the con- trivances are breaking down, that we shall expect to find the significant facts which may give us a glimpse of their real purpose. It is here we must search and here we may find the opportunity at least to test our theory. The argument of the essay is careful and long an.d I do not propose to follow it or to criticise it. Indeed in order to do that to any purpose one would have oneself to test cases. Its value to me is illustrative. If the new concept be tiue then the phenomenon is ono which exactly accords with it;- If the past exists in the orditary and absolute meaning of the word; if we can say, " There it is " in the non-spatial mean- ing of the adverb; if our history or duration be one continu- ous living action making itself; and if at each moment of the progressing action something is being added to a past which is carried along in the action and belongs integrally to it; then it is clear that at each moment of living experience the memory-form as well as the perception-form of reality is being created by the mind. Now suppose that the normal attitude of the mind is to be straining forward, to be anticipating, and that this attitude is kept constant by means of a mental mechanism which automatically throws the past into oblivion, which brings about a continuous forgetting-a forgetting never absolute, for that would defeat the end, but delicately adjusted as an instrumient of selection; then should we not expect that a first consequence of mental derangement or aberration would be a confusion of memory and perception? In Bergson's view we actually find this in the phenomenon of false recognition. The enfeeblement affects the attention to life and the first result is that the power of throwing the past into oblivion as it is created, or, to put it in objective form, the power of the progressing action to fall back and out of view, is deranged, the, patient loses the sharp distinction between past and present, or even experiences the present as past. The particular application of course may or may not be true. Even Bergson himself would claim for it no more than an approximation. What I am concerned to emphasise is the richness of the new concept and the utilisability of the new principle.'i First, then, let us see what is the fact in experi- ence to which Bergson appeals as the ground of the neW concept of reality. It is memory-not theory of memory, but the obstinate fact of existence which memory compels us to recognise. This fact of experience obliges us to substitute</page><page sequence="8">8 H. WILDON CARR:3 duration for extension as the substance of things. Duration is fundamentally psychical. Only what is psychical endures. Translate duration into physical terms and it becomes trans- formed into time, into something which is not duration but a different thing, succession. Time in the sense of succession is a dimension spatially conceived, i.e., it is not duration but extension. Extension is not absolute, it is purely relative to tension. Duration is absolute, it is the actuality of activity. It includes and conditions activity. Duration means that the past is present; that it is not non-existence; that it is not only present in the attenuated shape of more or less dim traces or recollections of what has been, but actually present as the very substance of activity, continued in and determining the forming action. It is the fact of memory which reveals the utter insufficiency of the old concept of a static reality. The concept of physical reality, of a matter occupying space and changing its relative position by the succession of its states in time is essentially discrete. Space and time as principles of continuity are external imposed conditions. In conscious- ness alone have we the pure fact of duration, and memory is a fact of consciousness. If the universe endures, it mulst mean that it is not an aggregate of discrete momentary existences, but that it lives; that its reality is not matter but history. The old concept, then, was of a reality on which life and consciousness depend: the new concept is of a ieality of which life and consciousness are modes. Modes are not dependent on reality but identical with it. - The physical or material universe in the old concept is essentially inert, movement and change being something added to it or imposed upon it, constituting it a system of external relations. In the new concept reality is activity and matter is an aspect or view. The physical aspect of the universe with its appear- ance of independence is itself a result of the evolution of life. It is correlative to the mode of intellectual activity evolved in human natute. Let us see then how the fact of memory stands in regard to each concept. According to the mechanistic view the physical universe is completely determined by the compensated actions and reactions which constitute it a system. This is expressed in the law of the conservation of energy. The present state of the universe is in this concept completely determined by the pasvt, and every future state of the universe is implicit in the present, but only the present state actually exists. The fact of memory, to conform with, such a concept, can only be explained by supposing that this material momentary universe retains in its present configuration the traces of its former,</page><page sequence="9">THE CONCEPT OF MIND-ENERGY. 9 configuration, and that there is a mental faculty of using this property to represent ideally the past. The past in this case exists only in idea not in fact. According to the new concept, on the other hand, the past which we remember exists in fact, and in memory we are simply conscious or aware of what is as actual in its own right as the world we perceive, It is not in the existence or non-existence of their objects that memory and perception are different. In memory the acted past, in perception the progressing action, comes to consciousness. This actual existence of which in memory we are conscious is not material or physical but spiritual or psychical. It is psychical existence because in mind alone and not in matter is there true duration, i.e., the existence of the past in the present. This affirmation of an existence which is immaterial and yet actual is free from the ambiguity of the old idealism, which never succeeded in throwing off subjectivism. " The world is my idea " is a proposition no one can refute, but it carries Lo conviction simply because there is no passage to objectivity and therefore no basis for physical science. " The world is history making itself" may sound paradoxical to us under the spell of the old concept but it is not ambiguous and it is not self-stultifying. It affirms a reali which is psychical without being subjective. It declares that the substance as well as the efficiency of the objective world of nature is the acted past, existing in, not simply externally continuous with, the present. It is a concept from which scientific advance can be made. It is based on the fact qf experience that the past of each individual is ever-present and ready to come to consciousness whenever the artifices which conceal it afford the means. Such is the new concept of spiritual reality. Instead of matter and movement conceived as the conditions on which life and consciousness depend, we have history and evolution as the present existence of which definite forms of life and -consciousAess are modes. In the new concept, however, matter and movement are not nothing and they lose nothing of their claim to be real. What is denied is their claim to independent existence in abstraction from the whole. In the concrete activity, life, they are dispositions whose form is determined'by a pairticular mode of conscious activity, the intellect. v The fa'ct of memory when we grasp its full significancc. in the new concept transforms completely the problem, baffling from the standpoint of the old concept, of the relation of consciousness and life. I have spoken of them as conjoined -in the new theory they are identical. It is very important</page><page sequence="10">10 H. WILDON CARR: THE CONCEPT OF MIND-ENERGY. to make this clear because it expresses the philosophical principle directive of a new science, the science of unconscious mind. The argument is that memory, if accepted as fact and not explained away by some theory of imprints or traces, implies that the fundamental reality is continuous not discrete. It is only living activity whose essential nature is continuity. When, then, life is conceived as itself the fundamental reality and not as something superposed on inert matter, uncon- sciousness ceases to be a pure negation, the simnple absence which serves to distinguish the inert from the living. Uti- consciousness and consciousness become strictly relative terms, both are modes of the life activity and it is unconsciousness which plays the active, consciousness which plays the passive, role. Thus, for example, when we fall asleep, unconscious- ness is not the absence of consciousness in the sense of a break of continuity of consciousness, it is the cessation of a mode of activity. When we awake, consciousness does not return as an effort to revivify past impressions, it is simply the resumption of the activity which unconsciousness had suspended. Life is not an activity which may or may not acquire consciousness, it is identical with it. Unconscious- ness represents its mode of concentration, or contraction, or tension, a mode necessary for its efficiency in action. Let us now consider the working principle which this new .concept puts in our hands. The key-note is the identity of life and consciousness. Unconsciousness even when it appears to be complete as in the plant is a positive acquire- ment. By means of it life, whicb is consciousness in its essence, canalises its activity. The most forcible illustration of the theory is the human intellect. The' intellect is not an endowment which enables us to discriminate the nature of reality and discover truth, it is a mode by which the life impulse, working' in us, narrows and restricts us to the par- ticular aspect of reality which favours our activity. It gives the distinctively human form to human actions. Matter is the aspect it presents. Matter is an arrest of change or movement. This arrest is purely relative to our actions aind it is the intellect which accomplishes it. The mode of its working is selection and the means of selection are con- trivances to secure unconsciousness. It is hardly necessary to point the conclusion. If the pro- mise of a vast extension of knowledge in that new domain w-hich we seem to have discovered by one of the same kind of accidents as those by which all the great discoveries in physical science have been -made, the domain we now call unconscious mind, it is by this new working principle it will be realised. It is the true method of psychical science.</page></plain_text>
