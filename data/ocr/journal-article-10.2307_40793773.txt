<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Fanla to New York and back: recovering the authorship and iconography of a slit drum from Ambrym Island, Vanuatu Eric Kjellgren Evelyn A. J. Hall and John A. Friede Asssociate Curator for Oceanic Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York A perennial issue facing curators and others charged with preserving and interpreting collections of objects made by Pacific Islanders and other indigenous peoples is the often total lack of information on the identity of the individuals who fashioned them or the specific significance of their imagery. Much of this dearth of information is the direct legacy of the erroneous assumption by previous generations of scholars and field collectors that what they termed 'art' or 'material culture' in these societies were essentially communal in origin, fashioned by 'anonymous' craftspeople as the expression not of individual creativity but of collective social conventions (Price 1989: 56). Thus, while specific information on the creators and significance of such objects was almost certainly available in many instances at the time that they were initially collected, this information was typically not recorded. As decades or even centuries have elapsed since the majority of objects in museum collections were acquired, the identities of their creators have, in most cases, been irretrievably lost. In rare instances, however, it remains possible to recover such information through returning to the people and place from which an object was collected. Where this is the case, it is important to do so in order that those who made the objects we term Pacific art can be acknowledged by the museums, scholars and critics that hold or write about their works. This paper documents one such case in which the author, through returning to the place of origin, was able to recover vital information on the authorship and imagery of a monumental slit drum (atingting kon)x from the northern region of the island of Ambrym in the nation of Vanuatu (Plate 1). The recovery of such information can make significant progress towards dispelling the myth of anonymity in indigenous art and assure that its creators take their place on equal standing with their Western counterparts in the history of art and culture. However, though far from the collective phenomenon envisioned by earlier scholars, indigenous conceptions of authorship in the creation of art works often differ significantly from those of the West. Western notions of authorship almost exclusively privilege the individual or individuals who actually fashioned a particular object as its exclusive creators or 'artists'. But many indigenous societies perceive and acknowledge authorship differently. This is the case among the people of North Ambrym, creators of the work described in this paper, who, while they can readily name the person or persons who fashioned a particular object, recognize the individual who commissioned the work, rather than those who made it, as its creator. 118 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="2">From Fanla to New York and back Plate 1.

Tofor's nasara, Fanla Village, North Ambrym, August 2001. Among the most prominent works in the Pacific galleries at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the slit drum (atingting kon) described in the present study was originally collected in Fanla village in North Ambrym and measures some 4.27 m in height. According to contemporary North Ambrymese interviewed in 2001, this imposing musical instrument once stood, along with others like it, on the village dancing ground {ranhara). Probably created in the mid to late 1960s, previous documentation for the work states that it was collected in Fanla by George W. Staempfli, an art dealer, around 1971 (Staemplfi 1972). However, like the majority of the Pacific Island works in the Metropolitan, the piece entered the collection without any specific information on its creator or iconography. Sincç the work had been carved at a relatively recent date, and as the tradition of slit drum carving in Fanla village is still ongoing (many examples are now created for sale as well as for ceremonial use), the potential existed that, through returning to Fanla, it might be possible to recover further information on its iconography, and the name Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 119</page><page sequence="3">Eric Kjellgren of the individual or individuals responsible for its creation. In August of 2001, the author traveled to Fanla to conduct research into the history and iconography of the Metropolitan's slit drum. This research yielded new information on the imagery of the work as well as the identities of its creators. Located some 2,400 km east of Australia, the nation of Vanuatu is a group of some eighty volcanic islands and islets forming a roughly Y- shaped archipelago, which runs north to south over a distance of some 885 km (Garanger 1996: 8). A land of tremendous cultural and artistic diversity, Vanuatu is home to over one hundred different peoples and languages. The island of Ambrym, from which the Metropolitan's slit drum originates, lies near the center of the archipelago. Roughly triangular in shape, and covered in dense rainforest, Ambrym is bordered to the west by the island of Malakula, to the north by Pentecost, and to the south by Epl. Both today and in the past, the peoples of Ambrym maintain active trading relationships with their neighbours. These include not only trade in goods and pigs, which continue play a central role in ritual life throughout Vanuatu, but also in songs, ceremonies and their associated art forms (see Huffman 1996). In fact, the designs for the characteristic slit drums seen in North Ambrym today, and for much of the twentieth century, are closely similar to those once found in the Port Sandwich area of Malakula, from which the rights to carve them were likely purchased during the nineteenth century (Huffman 1996: 191, Huffman, personal communication 2003, Pataud-Celerier 1997: 62). In their basic form slit drums2 are essentially hollow, or partially hollow, cylinders of wood or bamboo with a narrow longitudinal open slit, the edges of which are struck with stick-like implements to produce sound. Found in many parts of the Pacific, slit drums are among the most widespread percussion instruments in the region. In virtually all areas, however, slit drums are horizontal in orientation, lying either directly on the ground or raised up on a short base. Vertical slit drums are found only in central Vanuatu, where they occur from the southern half of Pentecost Island in the north, on Ambrym and Malakula (with its associated islets of Vao, Atchin, Wala and Rano), and also on Epi, Emwae, Nguna, Leleppa, and as far south Efate (Pataud-Celerier 1997: 56-7, Crowe 1996: 145, 147). Often towering over their players, vertical slit drums are played by percussionists, either sitting or standing, who strike the lip of the drum with club-like softwood mallets (Plate 2). Such large vertical slit drums produce deep resonant tones, which can carry for miles. Like many other art forms in Vanuatu, slit drums are intimately linked with ritual life. In North Ambrym ceremonial life centers on the male grade system or fangkon, 'sacred fire', a series of hierarchical initiations. Passing through each successive initiation rite (maghe) raises the individual up by one grade, giving the initiate greater religious knowledge, social prestige and say in village affairs. Men of each fangkon grade cook and eat only with those of the same grade, i.e. at the same 'fire' (Paton 1979: 22). Social position is not hereditary but is achieved through personal effort. It depends on an individual's success in organizing the resources and assembling the wealth required to pass through each of the grade initiations, mainly in the form of sacred pigs (Müller 1971 : 66). It is the goal of each 120 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="4">From Fatila to New York and back Plate 2. Drummers playing slit drums during a maghe ne sakaran grade ceremony held in Olal village, North Ambrym, 11 August 2001. Ambrym man to rise through the grade system until he reaches the highest grade and achieves the title of Mal3 (Patón 1979: 22). After death, an individual's position in the world of the ancestors is determined by the highest grade he achieved in life (Müller 1971:66). To coordinate and pay for each successive maghe ceremony involves a progressively greater expenditure in resources. There are about a dozen4 fangkon grades in Fanla village, and to organize and assemble the resources necessary for each one often requires years of planning. Only those individuals with the motivation, wealth, and necessary social skills succeed in reaching the highest grades. Men who have attained highest grades become the de facto leaders of society. This leadership usually takes the form of a gerontocracy, as it is normally only older men who can muster the enormous resources required to attain the highest grades (Müller 1971: 66). In some instances, certain fangkon grades are open to women, but only to those whose husbands have already achieved a certain fangkon rank (Paton 1979: 22-3).

The most important form of wealth assembled for and expended at the grade rituals consists of sacred tusker pigs. These are specially reared pigs in which the upper canine teeth or 'tusks' have been removed, allowing the lower tusks to slowly grow until they form a complete circle. This process takes several years and, during the later stages when the teeth have grown past a certain length, the pig must be hand fed. The food often includes magical ingredients, which help the tusk to grow into a strong full spiral. In rare cases a pig is raised until its teeth have grown until they form a spiral with two, or even three, complete circles (Pataud-Celerier 1997: 59). Sacred tusker pigs, whose teeth have grown to varying degrees of curvature, are essential items for both exchange and sacrifice during grade-taking ceremonies. They are also necessary for other important undertakings, including bride price, circumcision rites and the creation and erection of slit drums. Images of the spiral teeth of these sacred pigs also form part of the imagery of Ambrym slit drums, including the one in the Metropolitan's collection (see below). 122 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="6">From Fanla to New York and back Before examining the Metropolitan's slit drum in greater detail, it is important to understand some of the cultural background and functions of slit drums in North Ambrym. While slit-drum playing forms an integral part of grade initiations {maghe), slit drums themselves are commissioned for a variety of occasions, such as the opening of a new men's sacred hut {mei kon), funerary rituals and other purposes (Huffman, personal communication 2003). Today some examples are also created expressly for sale on the art market and are not used in ceremonial contexts. While each slit drum is initially commissioned for a specific event, once the event is concluded it becomes part of the assemblage of drums that stand on the dancing ground {ranhara) and constitute an informal orchestra (Plate 3). The drums are used for a variety of occasions and purposes. These include grade ceremonies, dances and other rituals. At such times, several of the slit drums may be played simultaneously, creating rhythms of astounding speed, precision and complexity. Drum players are usually drawn from men from the middle ranks of the grade system who are studied specialists in the intricate rhythms that accompany the various dances and ceremonies (Guiart 1956: 335). Although other means of communication have now become more important, slit drums formerly played a central role in communicating between villages. On Ambrym, Malakula and other islands there were, and are, sophisticated drum 'languages' that allow messages to be quickly sent, received and replied to by neighboring villages (Deacon 1970: 500, 503). Consisting of a complex system of beats and pauses whose meaning is understood by both senders and recipients, these languages permit messages about specific topics, even specific individuals, to be transmitted through the densely forested mountainous terrain at the speed of sound (Paton 1979: 60, Deacon 1970: 499-503). Hence, a message that, in the days before the advent of modern communications, would have taken a person walking between villages hours, or even days, to deliver, could be sent in a matter of seconds through the use of slit drums. In sum, slit drums, in their original contexts, were, and are, multifunctional objects. Adorned at the top with the images of remote ancestors, they are employed in contexts ranging from the highest maghe initiations to less formal dances and day-to-day communication between villages. In contemporary North Ambrym society, creation of slit drums for the external market also provides a sporadic, though significant, source of income. While the general functions and characteristics of slit drums in North Ambrym are well documented, there was previously little specific information on the particular example in the Metropolitan's collection. The slit drum was among the works exhibited at the exhibition 'Tumbuna: Ritual Art from Melanesia' held at Staempfli Gallery in New York, and the exhibition catalogue states that is was purchased in Fanla by the gallery owner, George Staempfli (see Staempfli 1972). The precise history, dates and extent of Staempfli 's collecting activities in Vanuatu remain largely undocumented. According to the information he provided in the exhibition catalogue, Staempfli purchased the work from Tofor, whom he states was, at the time, the highest ranking chief in Fanla. If this information is accurate, the drum was almost certainly purchased sometime in 1971 as Tofor 's father, Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 123</page><page sequence="7">Eric Kjellgren Tainmal, previously the highest ranking man in Fanla, died earlier that year, leaving To for as the leader of the community (Müller 1971: 74). Staempfli notes that, after the drum was purchased, a group of men from Fanla carried it from the mountains, where the village is located, down to the coast, where it was subsequently loaded onto a boat and taken to the nearby island of Espíritu Santo. There it was crated up and shipped, via Australia, to New York (Staempfli 1972). Beyond Staempfli's brief published account, no other information about the history, creator(s) and imagery of the piece existed in the Metropolitan's files. Through returning to Fanla some thirty years later, however, the author was able to obtain substantial additional information on the work and its creators. Although increasingly connected to the social and economic institutions of Vanuatu, and the world, Fanla, geographically, remains a difficult place to reach. Located in the mountainous terrain of North Ambrym, it requires a two-hour flight from the national capital of Port Vila on Efate Island, followed by a boat ride of several hours along the roadless north coast of Ambrym, and then a vigorous hike up into the mountains where the village is situated. Despite the difficulty of access, Fanla is frequently, though sporadically, visited by tourists, many of whom arrive at Ambrym in private yachts, or as members of organized tours, seeking to experience the village's distinctive cultural and artistic traditions. Many of the woodcarvings produced in the village today are made expressly for what is a small, but growing, external market, and dances and other performances are often organized solely for the benefit of foreign visitors, who are charged for the privilege of witnessing them. The traffic between Fanla and the outside world has also become increasingly bi- directional, and individuals and groups from the village now make frequent trips to Port Vila and elsewhere. Until recently the village remained one of the last holding out against the longstanding activities of Christian missionaries on Ambrym, but, in the last several years, Fanla has witnessed the arrival of both the Presbyterian and Seventh Day Adventist churches. Fanla today consists of twenty or so houses built from traditional materials, using a mixture of indigenous and introduced architectural conventions, and maintains two active dancing grounds {ranhará). Numerous slit drums still stand on these dancing grounds, where they continue to play an important role in ceremonial life, as well as in the growing phenomenon of cultural tourism (Plate 3). Chief Tofor, from whom the Metropolitan's slit drum was originally purchased, died in Fanla 1999. However, in 2001, two of his brothers, chiefs Etui Ngalgal Mweleun (Plate 1) and James Tainmal were still living. After Tofor 's death, Etui had become the highest ranking man in the village, and James Tainmal, himself a high-ranking chief, was the local fieldworker for the Vanuatu Cultural Centre, which, through its contacts with him, made arrangements for the author to visit the village. Shown photographs of the Metropolitan's slit drum, Etui and James Tainmal both said that they had a clear recollection of it. On learning that it was now in a Western museum, James Tainmal stated that he thought that it was appropriate that it should be there in order to serve as a symbol that the art and culture of Fanla were still strong. 124 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="8">From Fatila to New York and back Plate 4. Head of a slit drum. The eyes are adorned with representations of the morning star (metan galgai), Tofor s nas ara, Fanla Village, North Ambry m, August 2001. Etui and James Tainmal both agreed that the drum was originally commissioned by their father, whose name was Tainmal, who, in North Ambrymese culture, they recognized as the author of the work. They were also able to provide the name of its carver. According to them, the primary carver of the Metropolitan's slit drum was Tin Mweleun,5 an accomplished face-carver who lived and worked in a nearby village. As the carver of the face, the most important element of the slit drum, Tin Mweleun was acknowledged as the physical creator of the work. He would, however, undoubtedly have been assisted by other carvers in many labour-intensive aspects of the project, such as the hollowing of the trunk to create the resonating chamber. Tin Mweleun was active during the 1960s, and is known to have made several large slit drums in North Ambrym during this period (Kirk Huffman, personal communication 2003). Chiefs Etui and James Tainmal also noted that Tin Mweleun employed magic in order to carve the face correctly. To do so, he squeezed various supernaturally powerful leaves into the water of a drinking Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 125</page><page sequence="9">Eric Kjellgren coconut, and drank the liquid, and also applied leaves to his eyes in order to make his vision 'clear' so that he could carve the face quickly and properly. Once completed, the drum was brought to Fanla, where, according to Etui and James Taimal, it was erected on the old Tainmal dancing ground. Tainmal reportedly paid three pigs for the carving of the drum. Once the drum was set in place on the ranhara, Tainmal and his lineage held a big ceremony with dancing and pig sacrifices. The pigs were killed with a special club, and Tainmal gave a feast for the whole village. Following TainmaPs death in 1971, ownership of the drum passed to his son Tofor, who apparently sold it to Staempfli later that same year. Beyond the identities of the individuals who commissioned and carved it, James Tainmal was able to provide a substantial amount of new information on the iconography of the Metropolitan's slit drum. In examining the face (bweten atinting) of the drum, which represents a prominent village ancestor, one of the most prominent features are its two large disk-shaped eyes. Each of the eyes bears radiating designs in red, white and green paint, which surround a circular red pupil outlined in black (Plate 4). According to James Tainmal, these eye designs represent the morning star {metan galgai). The eyes sit atop the prominent nose with wide flaring nostrils, with the mouth being represented, as James Tainmal explained, by the long vertical slit, or tute. On most North Ambrym slit drums, including the Metropolitan's example, the face of the ancestor is surrounded by a series of several rows of concentric tooth- like projections, which James Tainmal identified as the figure's 'hair' (hingiye).6 At the base of the face are a pair of spiral forms, which represent the tusks of sacred pigs. In other North Ambrym villages the pig's teeth that appear on the slit drums are shown as single spirals, but the pig's teeth motifs on Fanla slit drums, such as the Metropolitan's, are shown as a double spiral. These double-spiral teeth commemorate a famous pig belonging to the Tainmal lineage, whose teeth had grown to form two full spirals. The jaw of such a pig is still preserved as a treasured possession by Chief Etui today (Plate 5). James Tainmal stated that the rights to create this specific design belong exclusively to the Tainmal lineage, and that for anyone else to carve it on a slit drum without appropriate payment and permission would be a serious violation of indigenous copyright. The rights to depict the small arms that appear on either side of the face are also owned by the Tainmals. On the reverse side of the large ancestral face on the Metropolitan's slit drum is a relatively naturalistic anthropomorphic image, depicting a figure with its arms upraised. Information provided by James Tainmal about similar images that adorn the backs of the slit drums in Fanla today, indicates that this image represents a spirit associated with the grade-taking system, and is another feature unique to Fanla slit drums. Published sources identify this being's name as 'nana' and say that it functions to ward off troublesome people, particularly thieves (Guiart 1956: 334, Pataud-Celerier 1997: 58). The unusual pose of the figure, with its arms raised straight up, may be a visual reference to the position assumed by an initiate at a grade-taking ceremony. During the climax of the ceremony, the initiate mounts upon a raised platform and, raising his arms above his head, begins to flap them in imitation of the flight of a sacred hawk, while he is pelted with various objects by 126 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="10">From F anla to New York and back Piate 5.

Thus the imagery on the drum itself may refer to an event from the grade-taking ceremonies at which, among other occasions, it is played. Overall, the information obtained from James Tainmal and others in Fanla reveals the imagery on the Metropolitan's slit drum to be far more complex than it appears. What, to a Western gaze, seems to be a stylized head with a naturalistic figure on its reverse side contains a complex series of visual allusions to phenomena as disparate as sacred pigs, grade-taking rituals and the morning star, all of which are inextricably entangled with local significances, power structures and systems of indigenous copyright. Looming over the village dancing grounds, the drums embody the power and majesty of the ancestors, whose faces watch over their descendants. However, they also serve as symbols of political power and the prestige, rank and privileges of the individuals who commission or own them. Conclusion By returning to Fanla, where knowledge of the creators and significance of the Metropolitan's slit drum remains within living memory, the author was able to recover essential information on what is one of the most prominent works in the museum's Pacific collection. As a result, the individuals responsible for its creation are no longer anonymous in the West - as, indeed, they never were among their own Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 12 7</page><page sequence="11">Eric Kjellgren people - and it is now possible to achieve a more detailed appreciation of its imagery and social significance. But the acquisition of this information itself presents a new series of issues and challenges. Since it was first commissioned and erected, the drum has been radically recontextualized, and it now resides in a setting that is far removed, both culturally and geographically, from the ranhara of North Ambrym. Incorporated into a different system of cultural values and visual aesthetics, its presence requires renewed attention to the ways in which the work is presented, and represented, to what is and will remain an overwhelmingly Western (or at least non-North Ambrymese) audience. While many exhibitions of Pacific objects in art museums and galleries have sought to decontextualize the objects in an effort to foreground a purely visual appreciation of their formal aesthetic qualities, this has not been the case at the Metropolitan. From the time the Pacific galleries first opened in 1982, the objects presented in them have been accompanied by extensive label texts, intended to give visitors information on the use and significance of the objects in their original contexts. At the time of writing, the Metropolitan is embarked on a complete reinstallation of the Pacific galleries. As an art museum, the physical display of the objects will continue to emphasize their remarkable visual qualities. However, a central objective in the reinstallation project is to provide enhanced cultural information on the works, including contextual photographs. The goal is to give visitors a more extensive background of the significance of the objects among the Pacific peoples who created them, including the ways in which their conceptions of art and artists differ from those of the West. The North Ambrymese notion of authorship, in which it is the individual who commissions rather than creates an artwork who is recognized as its creator, made clear in the course of the present research, is one such instance. Together with the insights of both Western academics and Pacific Islanders, this information represents an important step in the effort to provide a richer and more nuanced understanding of that diverse body of objects that, in the West, have come to be known collectively as Pacific art.
