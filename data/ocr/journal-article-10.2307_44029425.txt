<plain_text><page sequence="1">Applying the lessons of literary and cultural history to reveal how early media were manifest and received as "pleasured" texts , this essay com- bines the theories of McLuhan, Bakhtin, and Mulvey to make sense of the Internet, the new media complex which daily appears more incom- prehensible and beyond our control. Internet Censorship as "Cybriety": Freud, McLuhan, and Media Pleasures TONY TREMBLAY In Sackville, November New 1995, Brunswick, the sleepy was witness Canadian to what town Freud of Sackville, New Brunswick, was witness to what Freud and Foucault might have called an age-old autoerotic drama, one characterized by a predictable latency - a dis- crepancy between action and reaction, performance and reception. The event to which I am referring took place at Mount Allison University's Owens Art Gallery, where per- formance art and theater are regularly staged. Student Chris Yorke and a female actor, clad only in smashed eggs and silver tree tinsel, performed simulated oral sex on one another in front of an audience of almost fifty people. Although no one in the audience complained, and no one walked out, the viewers' acceptance, even appreciation, of the performance did little to sanction it. Very little. When the performance was subsequently reviewed in the local newspaper, the public's moral outrage was silently and decisively marshaled. A few days later, Chris Yorke was charged with public indecency. In finding Yorke guilty of indecency in the performance of his art, New Brunswick Judge Irwin Lampert declared that "community standards are the best measure of what is obscene and what is not." Yorkes only comment was as historically encoded as the judge s: "Human sexuality has been the subject of art for centuries; I feel violated by this decision" ( Telegraph Journal Mosaic 3211 0027-1276-99/167016 $02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">168 Mosaic 32/1 (March 1999) E5). Indeed, Yorke had been subject to the same social forces that violated the turn-of-the-century performance artists of Serpentine Dance (1895) and Pull Down the Curtains , Suzie (1904), two early peepshows made for Edison s Kinetscope. If the Mount Allison situation teaches us anything, it is how fundamentally sexuality is inscribed with cultural sanction, and how that sanction recurs as regular historical performance. With increasing frequency over the last few years, the Internet has become a flash point for the debate between free speech and censorship. Various Netscape sites have been removed from the Web, and others have been blackened by Internet Providers to protest social sanction. Two years ago in the United States, Congress hurriedly passed the Communication Decency Act, only to see it ruled unconstitutional a short time later. In Canada, a January 1999 British Columbia judgment challenged the legal- ity of restricting access to child pornography on the Web. Since that rul- ing, public opinion has been galvanized for censure: the call for Internet censorship - what I am terming "cybriety" (cyber-sobriety) - has been mobilized. The Internet, that vast mystical panacea that holds, we are told, so much of our hope for the future, is under threat. What are we to make of this, we non-cybrarians, occasional-surfers of the virtual world? In the early days of this debate, we can be certain of only one thing: left to the pundits, censorship becomes obscured. As Sallie Tisdale writes, "Censorship.. .makes it impossible not only to talk about the censored object, but about censorship" (13). "Pornography," concurs Walter Kendrick, "names an argument, not a thing" (31). And so censorship debates, regardless of what is being censored, are ideologically laden. These debates therefore require some historio-cultural archaeology to make sense of them. The novel, photography/film, and now the Internet are good sites with which to ground an exploration of the social psychology of censorship, as these are not only our most popular media, but those which perhaps best illustrate the action of all new media in the self-satisfying ("autoerotic") and unregulated ("offensive") stage of infancy. I do not mean to suggest any kind of structural evolution across these media, but to point simply to a historical recurrence that is observable in each medium s infancy, the time when each thrives in the unreflexive rapture of its own autoeroti- cism, independent of the sanction of the censor. Hybridizing McLuhan and Freud, I will argue that because all media are extensions of the body - speech extends the ear, print extends the eye - any new medium is inherently pleasurable; and, being pleasurable, any new medium invites the infantile game of daring, a pushing of the limits of what is "socially"</page><page sequence="3">Tony Tremblay 169 acceptable in order to fulfill desire. Just as Freud's infant, outside social sanction, fetishizes its own body, fondling itself in the most embarrassing of public/ (private) places, so will I show that the human body is fetishized vicariously through all new media. Being bodily, all new media are there- fore dangerous, as are all new technologies, a condition that farther invites embargo. In "outering" the Central Nervous System, the Internet, as McLuhan predicted, is likewise bodily, given to an age-old autoerotic drama that is rife with the inevitability of social sanction. My essay will illustrate how a recourse to literary history and to diegetic (or narrative) pattern is particularly instructive in the exploration of censorship as a cul- tural phenomenon. Sixteenth-century readers of the novel, the new narrative form of the time, were much less prudish than we are today, their openness reflected in a heady engagement with the lower-class anthropomorphism of sin, sex, the grotesque, and other bodily subversions. That a Benedictine monk was one of the most accomplished at presenting this orgiastic carnival of delights is simply a condition of pre-Reformation Christianity. Rabelais knew, as did the Roman Church fathers, that the otherwise respectable cit- izens of court and abbey were spectators, and, as spectators, they were voyeurs, always seeking an uncensored vista from which to watch the lower classes in the frenzy of their physicality. Rabelais s advance was to use the new narrative medium, the novel, to create a space and conditions (privacy and anonymity) within which learned spectators could discreetly exercise their fetish. It is indeed hard to separate this fetish from our own middle-class, supposedly "civilized" delight with many PBS representa- tions of third-world sexualities and other apocryphal anthropomorphic moments, in which the gaze is always directed to the site of procreative utterance. Naked pygmies and mating rhinos are therefore as "literary" as Gargantuan itches, if, by "literary," we mean metaphoric and highly styl- ized extensions of the human body. In the pre-condition of social sanc- tion, humans exercise their desires vicariously, as Rabelais knew. The significance of the new medium of the novel in this consideration of media lies in its formal and thematic generosity in meeting and satisfy- ing an audience, as all new forms do. In extending us outward, all new media and technology inevitably satisfy, holding us, at least in their infancy, in the spell of Freud s autoerotic "mirror stage." The provenance of the new medium of the novel was significant too, for not only was it populist in terms of autoerotic content, but in structural ancestry as well. Rising from "the rich soil" of verse narratives (Church 19), those oral</page><page sequence="4">170 Mosaic 32/1 (March 1999) forms that could not be sanctioned, the new genre paralleled the unlegis- lated folktale, which was "full of blunt, amused, and salacious stories.. .of castration and masturbation and incest, necrophilia and zoophilia, the mysterious power of the vagina and the clitoris" (Tisdale 13). As Bakhtin explained, the 16th-century novels immediate and unprecedented popu- larity was a direct result of this melding of bodily form and popular con- tent, a melding which recaptured a folksy, festive, and, at least at the outset, uncensored expression of carnality: ...[the new medium of the novel] returned us to the grotesque bodily billings- gate themes: diseases, monstrosities, organs of the lower stratum. All the ele- ments... are related to each other both in form and theme. All of them, independent of their literal content , refer to the unofficial aspect of the world, unofficial in tone (laughter) and in contents (the lower stratum). All of them relate to the world's gay matter, which is born, dies and gives birth, is devoured and devours; this is the world which continually grows and multi- plies, becomes ever greater and better, ever more abundant. Gay matter is ambivalent, it is the grave and the generating womb, the receding past and the advancing future, the becoming. ( 195, emphases mine) The new form, Bakhtin argued, was functioning outside social sanction; it functioned, that is, as an extension and celebration of the body in unre- flexive and rapturous contraposition to that sanction. Formal homologies abound. L'écriture féminine, as Hélène Cixous has posited, is a site of dif- férence from the phallocentrism of another kind of sanction, the male "word." The infancy of V écriture féminine, like other forms, celebrated the body in subversive resistance to the censorious and sanitized "Name of the Father." Paul Tiessens pioneering research into the women of early cinema - Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, and HD, to name a few - supports, as well, this contention that media, in infancy, is a vivifying extension of the body. Tiessens work reveals that female modernists of the 1920s not only considered silent films an antidote to the high-modernist "word" of their male counterparts (the so-called "men of 1914"), but they feared that, by re-instating the word, "talkies" would end the brief reign of the body that the silent era (i.e., film's infancy) initiated. For Dorothy Richardson, Tiessen notes, the silent film "was like a spirit, free of containment by spoken or written language" (22). In rejecting "a single, solipsistic view" in favor of "collective author- ship" and "communal and plural subjectivities" (23), high-modernist women, Tiessen argues, exercised "a political shrewdness aimed at resist- ing and subverting mens efforts to control literature and discredit cin- ema" (19). Theirs was an early "gynocriticism," set deliberately in</page><page sequence="5">Tony Tremblay 171 suggestive affinity with the iconic apparatus of moving images, that con- siderably predated V écriture féminine of the French feminists. Bakhtins notion of "the grotesque world of becoming ' (308, emphasis mine) is particularly relevant to Tiessens findings, since it reflects the action of all new media in the autoerotic "mirror stage." According to Bakhtin, in functioning as the pre-Reformation "populist" form, the novel was the people, providing a kind of hypodiegesis of innate desire and communal festival: "The carnivalesque crowd in the marketplace or in the streets is not merely a crowd. It is the people as a whole, but orga- nized in their own wayy the way of the people. It is outside of and contrary to all existing forms of the coercive socioeconomic and political organiza- tion, which is suspended for the time of the festivity" (255). In his work on scribal culture, McLuhan referred to this "becoming" as a spontaneous "outering" of the full sensibility of the people. So rare was this full flowering, McLuhan wrote, that it has found expression only in medieval, Restoration, and modern renewals. If McLuhan and Walter Ong are correct in suggesting that the Gutenberg press changed the medieval psyche from an ear to an eye reliance, then 16th-century readers were also "seeing" the world vicariously (and phenomenologically) for the first time, much as we are experiencing the world today for the first time through virtual and in some cases synchronous multi-media. In the span of less than one hundred years, then, the body was celebrated both in "becoming" (the late-Medieval carnivalesque) and in sensory recombi- nation (the early- Renaissance carnality that swapped an ear for an eye). The sensory stimulus must have been unimaginably emancipating, wildly titillating, and, therefore, terribly threatening. That the body would lose, as it always does, was inevitable. The Reformation made certain of that, symbolizing, as program and historical recurrence, a legislation of the materiality of the body. As modern theo- rists point out - and as evidenced by Thomas Nashes comic attacks on the Puritans in the 1590s - period legislators became notorious coiners of phrases, crafting "euphemisms... out of a dead language to describe the living menace of sexual arousal" (Crabbe 46). Thus it was, as Andrea Dworkin notes, that the words "pornographic" and "erotic" were coined (199). Not only was the body vis-à-vis the new media sanitized, but so was the language used to describe it, a "coercion," in Bakhtins terms, that threatened "the people s vivid awareness of historic immortality" and all but quashed the Renaissance "renewal of culture" (324-25). The key point that Bakhtin makes is that the new medium, the novel, held the human body up as "the centre of a philosophy that contributed to the destruction</page><page sequence="6">172 Mosaic 32/1 (March 1999) of the medieval hierarchic picture of the world and to the creation of a new concept" (362). In the autoeroticism of its infancy, an infancy unre- flexive but charitable (i.e., there was lots of carnality to go around), the new medium of the novel wrote the body, both literally (as form) and fig- uratively (as content). What Bakhtin s cultural history does not fully account for is the role of individual subjectivities in electing to participate in an erotic fantasy sud- denly licensed by a new medium. Individual agency, however, is taken into account by Lyndal Roper in her study of medieval sexuality, where she calls for "a history that can problematize the relation between the psychic and the physical" (21). Criticizing psychoanalytic historians such as Norbert Elias and Max Weber, whose theories too readily "historicize the unconscious" (7), Roper questions whether the psyche is really a con- struct of "social disciplining" (145) or whether it exists independent of the "tenuous controls" (6) of civilization. Ropers conclusion - that, as materiality, bodies are largely independent of social discourse - estab- lishes the primacy of individual/corporeal agency as that which seeks an erotic fantasy that depends on private encounter, exactly that privacy which early book culture afforded. When Roper s work is considered in light of the findings of reception theorists such as H.J. Chaytor and Henri- Jean Martin (and even McLuhan's forays into the biological changes that attended the movement from scribal to print cultures), it becomes quite evident that typography and press production mon- opolized upon the pre-existent materiality of the "separate citizen" (Understanding Media 84). Martins contention that "reading implied an involvement of the entire body" and served to demarcate "individualism" and "private dialogue" (72, 450, 508), supports Roper's claim that medieval individuals "[thought and felt] against the social grain" (9). Once this subversive praxis is understood historically, Bakhtin s theo- ries of the novel's formal affinities with human desire make much more sense. The autoeroticism of the new medium of the novel, when consid- ered in the light of the onanistic eroticism of silent reading, suggests a medieval psyche that was fully invested in its own program of channeling desire. In its infancy, the novel was a representation of the body that lay below the surface of a coercive culture; reading was therefore a sensual delight, evident in Alberto Mangueis playful evocation of Colette's early reading fantasies: It is summer. Sunk deep in the soft bed among feather pillows, with the inconstant rumble of carts on the cobble-stones outside the window in the Rue de l'Hospice in the grey village of Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye, an eight-</page><page sequence="7">Tony Tremblay 173 year- old girl is silently reading Victor Hugo's Les Misérables. She doesn't read many books; she reads the same ones over and over again. She loves Les Misérables with what she'll later call "a reasoning passion"; she feels she can nestle in its pages "like a dog in its kennel." Every night she longs to follow Jean Valjean on his agonizing peregrinations, meet Cosette again, meet Marius, even the dreaded Javert.... Her mother does not believe in fiction: "so many complications, so much passionate love in those novels." (140) The emergence and coercion of the 16th-century novel reveals that the "producerly" delight that Manguei attributes to Colette must exist covertly, otherwise risk being sanctioned in the "Name of the Father." With the advent of photography at the height of the Victorian era, the diegetic cycle of corporeal form and censorship was repeated yet again, this time in response to the "zoögyroscopes" and wet-plate photographs of "the human figure in motion" (Muybridge viii). Knowing that the body, as opposed to the word, is defined in movement, photography pio- neers Eadweard Muybridge and Thomas Easkins produced stills of nude bodies in motion - women washing clothes, men jumping, etc. By the time of the "kinematograph" at the turn of the century ( kinema from the Greek meaning "motion"), early film opportunists began producing "loops," known today as "skinflicks," which presented versions of porn and erotica to both male and female viewers alike, many of whom gath- ered to watch these celluloid vaudevilles in polite company and respectable surroundings (Czitrom 46). The more recent history of film also reveals that film producers not only understood, but were willing to monopolize on, the autoerotic tactility of their medium. Anthony Crabbe s research found that it was almost solely producers and corporate shareholders who challenged censors when the "traditional film industry [of the early 1970s] was in sharp decline" (48). The resulting "decensor- ship of the time" not only produced our modern culture's classic blue nuits (Au Pair Girls , Behind the Green Door ; Deep Throat, and Emmanu- elle) , but more fundamentally brought people back to the theater, renew- ing again the people s desire for a marketplace carnality, and renewing again the cycle of prudish outcry and embargo. That film chose vaudeville as its first "popular" spectacle and rescue, just as the 16th-century novel chose the carnivalesque, is a curious and instructive recurrence indeed, establishing populist precedents for the inundation of "Adult" Cyber Malls on the Internet. Laura Mulvey's groundbreaking 1973 essay, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," remains the most vivid analysis to date of the film mediums tendency to extend the male gaze in what she terms an eroti- cized "scopophilia":</page><page sequence="8">174 Mosaic 32/1 (March 1999) The magic of the Hollywood style at its best (and of all the cinema which fell within its sphere of influence) arose.. .from its skilled and satisfying manipu- lation of visual pleasure. Unchallenged, mainstream film coded the erotic into the language of the dominant patriarchal order. In the highly developed Hollywood cinema it was only through these codes that the alienated subject, torn in his imaginary memory by a sense of loss, by the terror of potential lack in fantasy, came near to finding a glimpse of satisfaction: through its for- mal beauty and its play on his own formative obsessions. (16) Mulvey 's analysis is predicated on the male desire to fulfill lack, a lack stemming, as Freud outlined in Three Essays on Sexuality , from the male's fear of castration. She argues that the mechanics of film and cinematic apparatus position male and female viewers alike in the role of voyeurs, appropriating a pre-existent Oedipal drama that fixes women as the object of the spectatorial gaze. The feminist response to Mulvey s classic essay - captured best in Ann Kaplans question, "Is the gaze male?" (qtd. in Doane 5) - led Mulvey to rethink the role of male perspective in the construction of female subjectivity. The result was her 1981 "After- thoughts" revision, in which she deliberately and consciously imposes "masculinity as 'point of view'" (29) on the female spectator. Linking her earlier problematic use of the "generalized male third person singular" to "Freuds theory of femininity" (30), Mulvey advances her 1973 analysis of scopophilia by situating desire in "trans-sex[ual]" (31) individual agency. Like Lyndal Roper, Mulvey reads cultural participation as deixis, depen- dent on the play of shifting context and Oedipal homology: "The 'person- ifications' and their iconographical attributes do not relate to parental figures or reactivate an actual Oedipal moment. On the contrary, they represent an internal oscillation of desire, which lies dormant, waiting to be 'pleasured' in stories of this kind" (37). And this is why, suggests Mary Ann Doane, that in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo, Mia Farrow can enjoy a storied pleasure that is ungendered, rooted rather in the more basic imaginary functioning of subjective agency: "In the course of Mia Farrow's fifth or sixth viewing of [The Purple Rose of Cairo], she actually catches the gaze of the male romantic lead who notices her, turns, and, drawn by her fascination, steps down off the screen to join her in the 'real world.' He rapidly falls in love with her, fulfilling her spectatorial dreams" (1). Ungendered, the pleasure of looking reflects an erotogenic fascina- tion with the human form, a fascination legislated by "screening and nar- rative conventions [that] give the spectator an illusion of looking in on a private world," thereby protecting the spectator's anonymity and ensuring his security. As Mulvey notes, "the extreme contrast between the darkness in the auditorium (which also isolates the spectators from one another)</page><page sequence="9">Tony Tremblay 175 and the brilliance of the shifting patterns of light and shade on the screen helps to promote the illusion of voyeuristic separation" (17). As extended sensorium, the film form and screening room naturalize and, like the book, technologize our anthropomorphism, as Hitchcock and his later film noir descendants knew - and as Rabelais and Muybridge knew before them. In this context, Pee Wee Hermans recent fall from grace for "exposing himself" during the screening of an adult movie seems less about the sordid "paP" of popular culture, a view that was widely circulated in the press, and more a metaphor for film's tendency to project us back to Freud's infantile-erogenous, where the autoe rotic attends the encounter with media. Mulvey 's reminder that "popular cin- ema inherited traditions of story-telling that are common to other forms of folk and mass culture" (32) situates Pee Wee s behavior in a long- running and hypodiegetic Oedipal oscillation, one which Gabriele Schwab ties into Bakhtin s notion of dialogicity. Arguing that "imaginary functions are rooted in the constitution of the subject" (455), Schwab makes the same case as Roper, Doane, and Mulvey for a subjectivity whose locus is "always already" oriented toward occupancies by new media. Film historian Noël Burch's contention that film "syntax" causes spectators to "react with their whole bodies," which in turn results in "a brief hallucinatory state" (244) seems further indication that new media occupy the gaps in the deep grammar of subjectivity. After Hitchcock's Rear Window , Brian De Palmas Body Double pro- vides the archetypal film moment of the kind of erotogenic gaze that lulled Pee Wee Herman into a forgetful onanistic sleep. Capturing exactly the "scopophilia" that Mulvey described, and from which Pee Wee suf- fered, a reviewer of Body Double wrote: "This Brian De Palma thriller is often gruesome, disgusting, and exploitative. But you can't take your eyes off the screen" (qtd. in Martin &amp; Porter 926). Indeed one cannot, and that is exactly the point: the eyes cannot stop watching when the watching itself is the action of the fetish. De Palmas film is particularly relevant to Mulvey's findings because it foregrounds its own consciousness of form (i.e., the act of watching), which, contrary to what we might expect after reading Mulvey, is not at all fulfilling. And De Palmas film is not unique in its presentation of this rupture. Bedroom Eyes and Boxing Helena are two other films of the post- 1970s renewal period that foreground a simi- lar action and reaction of the voyeur. All deal with the shocking conver- gence of the watcher and his watching, and each concludes that a Mulvian psychopathology results when the watcher, "torn in his imaginary mem- ory by a sense of loss," catches himself enjoying the fetish of his gaze. Just</page><page sequence="10">176 Mosaic 32/ 1 (March 1999) as the sleepwalker should never be woken, so should the watcher never see himself watching. As these "voyeur" films point out, the consequences are dangerous. Psychoanalysists would say of De Palma s voyeur that his motor sys- tems have shut down, reducing him to the pre-Symbolic. Moreover, he is unconsciously disturbed by two other afflictions, his castration by cuck- oldry and his "scopophilia," a desire that fulfills the former lack. He is not only rife with phobias, then, but rife to the point of inaction, which the narrative bears out: his viewing is occasioned by a convalescence from a bout of stultifying claustrophobia. The more telling and, in fact, the consummate psychoanalytic moment in the film, though, is when the voyeur's eroticized gaze recognizes itself peripherally in the "guise" of an Indian who also is watching, and whose watching culminates in a grue- some murder. To the focused and conscious perspective of the voyeur, a consciousness that is clearly limited, the murder is obviously a sex slaying; peripherally and unconsciously, however, the Indian is both a condensa- tion and displacement of the voyeur's own primal self, one that is secretly feared for the abandon and potential infamy of its voyeurism. The films genius lies in capturing the analysanďs sudden and disturbing recogni- tion of his own worst tendencies, which, as always, are his own base ten- dencies. The psychic rupture is akin to the trauma of the mirror-stage objectification of the body, the only difference being that De Palmas sub- ject is no longer protected by infancy or the mother. In explaining why a trauma is both decisive and debilitating, Schwab provides a clue as to why De Palmas physically healthy male looker has mentally regressed to the level of imaginary functioning: The discovery that the mirror image is an image of oneself can produce so decisive an effect because it makes the body identifiable for the first time as a bounded and organized unity of one's own self. It is crucial that this takes place at a time when, because of his defective control of his motor system, the subject still experiences the latter as uncoordinated, and himself as helpless, dependent, and fused with his environment and other subjects. (457) As diegetic medium, the film exposes the look by showing the looker a reflection of himself, which is the unannounced fissure that defamiliarizes the dreamwork and awakens the dreamer. When the eyes see the eyes see- ing, the illusion is over and the censor rushes in to restore order, which is the action too of all censorship. It was in this fashion that the Reformation attempted to restore the balance of authority that had been threatened by heterodox Renaissance humanism and secular carnality. If media indeed are unregulated in infancy, which I have been arguing, then</page><page sequence="11">Tony Tremblay 177 the duration of that infancy is also short-lived. iSTAR, our largest Internet provider, has already removed a number of newsgroups in the alt.sex and alt.gaysex galaxy. Such caution, it says, is grounded in third-party liability - that it may be held legally responsible for material its customers down- load, save, and distribute. The way that iSTAR and other Internet providers foreground this caution is what is most interesting. Instead of quietly removing what they think is questionable material, they are putting it loudly under erasure , raising the stakes of the psychic trauma by placing an emboldened BEWARE! or FORBIDDEN! across the screen. Their tactic, in calling attention to affinities and adjacencies, is psychoan- alytically astute; it defamiliarizes so abruptly that it upsets, calling ones attention to the baseness of one's need to view it in the first place. Th, short analysis of our most popular narrative media illustrates that, in terms of the evolution of their forms, the novel and photography/film are similar in fundamental ways: they begin, in infancy, in an unreflexive drama of autoeroticism; they suffer through the mediating and coercive ideologies of corporate sanction; and they emerge as mature forms when they begin to foreground and problematize their own discursives, as if their greatest fears were their own "base" tendencies. To maintain corpo- real sovereignty (the authority of the body), both forms then go under- ground, where "'specialist' sex" and other expressions of the body, regardless of whether in film or book form, are available to those who want them. Today, cyber theorists reiterate the by now familiar insights of Rabelais, Muybridge, and Mulvey. Cameron Bailey's work is one such reiteration, suggesting that with the Internet "the suburban ideal of post- war North America returns in virtual form: communication at a safe dis- tance, community without contact. Is it any wonder that when movies visualize the Net's matrix of communication, it so often resembles the cool, aerial patterns of a suburb at night?" (22). Claudia Springer concurs with Bailey, noting that "at a time when paranoia over human contact in response to the AIDS virus is common, human interaction should occur through computerized communication, with the participants far apart and unable to touch each other" (71). Much of the efficacy and the entice- ment of the Internet, then, is that it is so anonymous; "browsers," "lurk- ers," "hyperqueens," and those in "MUDs" and "cyberdrag" can be whom- ever or whatever they choose without anyone ever knowing who they really are - or can they? This is the key question that always attends the constructed private spaces of autoeroticism. Are those spaces secure</page><page sequence="12">178 Mosaic 32/1 (March 1999) enough? In the case of the computer, the electronic footprints left in cyberspace in secret files like "NETSCAPE.HST" are often enough, when discovered, to wrest the subject from his illusory symbiosis with the imag- inary. Once again, a reversion to narrative dreamwork is instructive. In Irwin Winkler s 1995 cyber- thriller The Net&gt; Sandra Bullocks computer wiz- ardry complements her reclusiveness, affording her a rich, anonymous identity. So vivifying is this private-world onanism that one of her com- puter's screen-saver messages reads, "The computer is the ultimate con- dom." Wrapped in cyber-shield, her psyche lives in abandon, pleasuring itself at will. She exists as a kind of etherized libido without any incarnate identity. When her scant "real" identity is stolen, she is hard-pressed to locate another fleshy being who can corroborate the materiality of her existence. The films sexual metaphor was wisely chosen, as this historio- diegetic exploration of media has demonstrated; for, while condoms pro- tect the innocent in the high-risk application of their primal business, they also sometimes don't, a breaking that foregrounds identity as noth- ing else does, with paternity being the ultimate exposure. So, yes, con- doms and the Net do license risky behavior - both mask identity to free the libido - but both can also rupture, an imprimatur of risk that is the exact opposite of what the reclusive identity, Mulvey s already "alienated subject," seeks. This paradox, evident also in De Palmas Body Double , is a result of our historical mind/body schizophrenia, which in the late 20th century is manifest as our culture s simultaneous technofetish and technophobia. We seek vicarious gratification through our extended sensoria, of which virtual technologies and the Internet are the newest extensions, but at the same time fear that bodily abandon is either dangerous or unworthy of our high rationalism - hence the censure. In fear of reprisal, sanction, or worse, fulfillment, we construct taboos, like the contemporary cyber- myth that computers will themselves become sensate and, like a teacher, parent, or omniscient God, will exact great revenge for our masturbatory inclinations. The Internet may very well be our most advanced technol- ogy today, but the deep grammar of its formal apparatus is not new. In opening private spaces within which humans can cross dress, don multi- ple personalties, and explore their repressed sexualities, the Internet is but the latest anthropomorphic envelope. Its targeting by censors should not be read as specific to its own nature, but as specific to the nature of all new media. The furor over Internet censorship is tantamount to a recurrence of the psychoanalytic morality play that has gone on since the Church</page><page sequence="13">Tony Tremblay 179 fathers censored the Bacchanalia and since social forces mollified, sani- tized, and "coerced" the autoeroticism of various other extensions of the body. An approach to Internet censorship grounded in media and psychoan- alytic theory enables us to expose what Foucault considered the historical inevitability of encoding bodily pleasure in the "discourse" of sexuality, an inevitability yoked to language that is both polysemous and indetermi- nate. The practical danger of not exposing such "discourse" is evidenced in the language of H.J. Eysenck and D.K.B. Nias in their introduction to Sex , Violence and the Media : This book... is concerned with the possible influence that viewing and reading overtly pornographic and violent material may have on a person's conduct. The media - TV, films, plays, pornographic magazines, even advertising - have come under increased criticism because of the suspicion that their more and more overt portrayal of scenes of violence and sex may be responsible for changes in our civilization which to many people are undesirable - an increase in violence, in vandalism, in pre- and extramarital sex, in perversions, in rape and in the sexual exploitation of minors. If these complaints are justified to any reasonable extent - and of course no one has suggested that all the changes that have happened in the past thirty years or so can be laid at the door of the media - then clearly society will have to think seriously about possible con- trols that ought to be instituted in order to restrain these influences from tear- ing our society to pieces. (9, emphases mine) Such a view of media and censorship is admittedly idiopathic, inviting, by virtue of that pathology, theoretical study after study, all manner of disci- plinary applications, many different pundits, and, finally, little explo- ration of details save a fetishization of the histrionics. Those fighting the censorship wars would like nothing better than obscurity and histrionics, for the "hopelessly deadlocked" view of the censorship debate solves most of their problems, releasing them from the responsibility of clear state- ment, historical precedent, and vital particulars. It should be no surprise that another censorship movement is forming in Germany today, this time in response to the Internet. And while, at least on the surface, a good deal of Germany's lead in the Internet censor- ship area appears to be rooted in the suppression of hate, the definition of hate is easily expandable beyond race and religion to include other ideological texts, such as the body. This malleability of application lends itself to what Tzvetan Todorov referred to as a "contagion" of ideology. And while it is foolish to argue against the suppression of hate, it should not follow that the body is part of that which is suppressed, for, as this</page><page sequence="14">180 Mosaic 32/1 (March 1999) essay illustrates, hate is not part of the spontaneous action of new media in vivifying the body. Actually, just the opposite. As Todorov understood, hate, like sexuality, has become discourse; and so it is left to the critic, finally, to perform the delicate surgery that separates one ideology from another - in the case of this essay, the body and its technological exten- sions (the book, photography/film, and the Internet). Todorov would have considered it symptomatic of "discursive" thinking, for instance, that some groups today are arguing that media is inherently violent because it is essentially patriarchal, an argument that deflects the current media debate from being something rigorous, an opportunity for exploring the ways that media shape our lives, and turns it into something political, another opportunity for special-interest (i.e., exclusive) proclamation. In fact, as Annette Kuhn observes in Cinema , Censorship and Sexuality 1909 - 1925y it is as a result of this polysemy that cinema sexuality has been bifurcated along male and female lines - along the lines of what is porno- graphic (the male hegemony) versus what is erotic (the female antidote). McLuhan and Todorov are alike in advocating a lessening of what Fredric Jameson called "idiolect" ( 188) in order to expose the vital partic- ulars, those that prevent us from falling prey to polarization and indeter- minacy. Surely there is more we can do to expose hegemonies than simply becoming embroiled or incited politically in ideologically charged strug- gles that pit men against women, capitalists against ecologists, and techies against Luddites. Those strategists planning the latest censorship on- slaught against the Internet would like nothing better than our polemical shouting. Crabbe s point, reminiscent of Foucault, that "decensorship allowed the economic muscle of the entertainment industry to transform freedom of expression into a consumable product" (51) is particularly relevant here, for our confused release to the dominant oppositions of promoters and censors spells our critical surrender. As McLuhan counseled, "the essence of education" should provide "civil defense against media fallout (i.e., against 'the subliminal operation of our own technologies')" ( Gutenberg Galaxy 246). Will we forever ignore history, will we be led in deference again, looking to television and other politically motivated interests to form our opinions? If we allow ourselves to become embroiled in a cleverly orchestrated debate that speaks to gender and other ideologically charged "blind spots," as Walter Kendrick calls them, then the answer is surely YES. The lesson offered by McLuhan lies in his own reversion to history and narrative to seek that which recurs in human behavior when humans embrace new media and technologies. That lesson imparts a simple but demanding humanism:</page><page sequence="15">Tony Tremblay 181 that we must not release anyone from the responsibility of clear state- ment, historical precedent, and vital particulars. The Internet can be as complex as its current industrial "discourse," or as simple as a recurring historical moment, one which again extends human desire into the expressive realms of the autoerotic. Given the evidence thus far, I hold for the latter. Internet censorship, or cybriety, is not new; it is a re-run of our favorite drama, the psychoanalytic morality play that teeters between our desires and our fear of their fulfillment.
