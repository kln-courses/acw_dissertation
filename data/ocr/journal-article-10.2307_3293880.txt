(Entretiens sur l'antiquite' classi- que, Tome 1) Vandoeuvres, Geneve: Fondation Hardt, 1954. Pp. 308. THIS IS A SERIES of seven lectures, together with the frequently lively discussion that followed each talk, presented at the first "entretiens sur l'antiquite classique" organ- ized by the Fondation Hardt at Van- doeuvres near Geneva in September of 1952, and attended by ten scholars from five na- tions. The admirable examples set by the conference (so far superior to the usual symposium), the interest of the subject, and the quality of the contributions war- rant our giving more attention than is usual for collections of papers. "The concept of god in Greek thought"- few questions so intrigue the layman when he is introduced to Greek civilization, and the classicist himself meets it at every turn. But all too often the subject is left to the casual obiter dictum of a scholar bent on other matters or to a generalization from one period or author to the Greeks as a whole, or, worst of all, to some confidently held theory of the progress of man and re- ligion. Here the discussion has been divided among various specialists; this has the obvious virtue of postponing the tempting generalization, and the danger that the spe- cialists will not be talking about the same thing may prove a positive advantage, for in fact our sources do not permit us to fol- low the same level of thinking about the divine all the way from Homer to Plato-- often they too are not talking about the same thing, and it is when we forget this that we are most likely to distort the evi- dence or to be baffled by irreconcilable conflicts. The virtues of this approach can hardly apply to an introductory lecture by H. J. Rose which tries in a few pages to indicate overall problems and their solutions, e.g., his notion of a social dichotomy (seen as primarily economic) in Greek religious thought between the upper and lower orders, the enlightened aristocrat of leisure and means, and the less intelligent poor ("It seems to be natural for the less intelli- gent dwellers by the Mediterranean to be polytheists and worshippers of powers close at hand. ... " [p. 23]). Social considerations are unquestionably of enormous significance for the history of religion but here we seem to have an over-simplification which, based on our own cultural environment (not ex- cepting the mana ascribed to backward na- tives), explains very little. An unrehearsed summation to go with Rose's frequently acute comments on detailed points in dis- cussion might have been more rewarding. Pierre Chantraine's treatment of the di- vine in Homer is an excellent, sober analy- sis. He uses his special linguistic compe- tence to illuminate where the evidence is strong but to insist on our uncertainty where that is required. His discussion may be summarized under these headings: the term daimo.n, the anthropomorphic gods, and the positive role of Zeus and the gods in general with regard to human morality and fate. Daimo.n usually refers to the undif- ferentiated or unidentified divine and its predominance in speeches indicates a us- age drawn from life. One cannot raise the question of the historical priority of dai- mones and the personal gods-they are on two different levels of thought. The "heav- enly" connections of the Greek gods as a whole go back to their Indo-European ori- gins and this is especially clear with Zeus and the adoration of the bright sky; into this conception of the gods are admitted figures of diverse origin including the per- sonification of natural forces and of abstract ideas. Their fully human form and personal qualities and the avoidance of the animal, the monstrous, and the magical are striking characteristics of the Olympian gods, and a great step towards a rational approach. Nonetheless in their relations to one an- other and to man they are essentially amoral. It is with the role of Zeus as Zeus pat,.r, exercising patriarchal authority and reflecting perhaps something of the Myce- naean king's position that we find divine support for the family, oaths, guests and suppliants, and, at times, of human justice. Zeus, the gods, or Fate (moira, m6ros, aisa-basically "man's lot") are the source of the overall plan of events, and possible inconsistency between a personal Zeus and impersonal moira is not fully resolved. The Odyssey, with a closer connection between the gods and morality, shows a later stage in the evolution of moral thought. Chantraine rather underestimates the lit- erary, "fictional" elements in the repre- sentation of the divine. Whereas the use of 186</page><page sequence="2">CONCEPT OF GOD 187 daimo.n, Zeus pate.r, mnoira, etc., seem to correspond to genuine conventional belief, the more anthropomorphic and scandalous representations of the gods are largely the result of the bardic imagination work- ing in the tradition of heroic epic whose protagonist is man. Thus a conflict between Zeus and moira only arises in a fictional situation when Zeus is a character in a story. Again the religious and moral differ- ences between the Odyssey and the Iliad have much to do with the differences be- tween saga and mdirchen (heroic epic and fairy tale), as Rose reminds us in the dis- cussion. This is not to relegate the literary aspects to convention and the poet's con- venience while we rescue them from the precincts of "sacred story." The importance of myth as artistic imagination, both for the individual shaper of myth and the so- ciety that receives it, is too easily slighted, perhaps because discussion leads so often to the fantastic. Hesiod, according to Bruno Snell, con- trasts with Homer in his attempt to en- compass all the divine, the world as it really is: the dark, the primitive and mon- strous, as well as the light (he compares the contrasting approach of a Thucydides and a Herodotus). The wider realm of the manifestation of the divine-everything being "full of gods"-leads to a unity of the divine, and, paradoxically, towards phil- osophy and monotheism. His concern with origins, with archai, points in the same direction, and in his pessimistic view of man in the Works and Days, the contrast between mortal life and the eternal, be- tween appearance and reality, he also an- ticipates the philosophers. The manifesta- tions of the divine are abstracted from their natural surroundings and organized into his genealogical and hierarchic sys- tems-rather like a Linnaean system of the gods. Basic to Hesiod's scheme is the con- trol of the world by Zeus, the highest god. This magnification of Zeus at the expense of the other gods is continued by the lyric poets in their emphasis on one god (for Sappho, Aphrodite; for Pindar, Apollo) who is holier, more powerful, and more real-- a permanent, pervasive force rather than a momentary manifestation of power. Snell, always stimulating, is perhaps more convincing in internal analysis of Hesiod, especially on particular passages such as the catalogue of Nereids, Theog. 240 ff., than in attempts to show Hesiod's anticipation of philosophic thought. Snell has done much to foster a view of develop- ment from a hypothetical primitive state of mind to rational philosophy and mono- theism. But what is usually said of the primitive background amounts to guess- work and the stages beyond are so discon- tinuous that in seeking for resemblance and continuity we may miss the essence of Hesiod's own viewpoint in the context of his own age and his own form of literature. With the Pre-Socratics O. Gigon stresses the difficulties in the way of sources and background that prevent a fair estimate of their theology, but he insists on its impor- tance for understanding the context of sub- sequent ancient theology. From the Mi- lesians up to the Atomists a concern to ex- plain natural phenomena rationally and re- move them from the realm of the divine in effect continues the work of the theog- onies in developing systems but avoids identifying their essential principles with the divine. In Xenophanes Gigon sees a theological radicalism which leads either to agnosticism or atheism, or back to tra- ditional views and their refinement, starting with Democritus, through a con- sideration of the consensus gentium. Par- allel to this approach, which admits but has no necessary place for the traditional divinities in a rational cosmos, is a view of the cosmos as a work of art, implying the existence of a cosmic artisan. Anax- agoras' noi2s is an active, not a mechan- ical, principle but he too avoids calling it the6s (which at once means so many lesser things and, we might add, is predominantly anthropomorphic). In discussion it is agreed that though we know little of the relationship between the philosopher and his society and its cults, philosophical at- tack was directed against myth, and above all against "Homer," not against cult.1 The tragedians are divided between H. D. F. Kitto (Aeschylus and Sophocles) and the late Fernand Chapouthier (Eurip- ides). What is the relationship of the ac- tivity of the gods to that of men? asks Kitto. The same action is often presented on two levels, the divine level showing the wider meaning of the action on the human level. "It is the divine background which shows us that a universal (Kitto calls it Dike. for Electra and 0. T.) is at work in the particular case." The ever-present prophecies have the same function. For Sophocles the gods "symbolize his concep- tion of an unchanging framework of Law which permeates human life as it does the physical universe." This is moral law but in the Electra even closer to natural law, which accounts for the apparent cruelty of the gods in Sophocles (again, especially in the Electra). In Aeschylus to the gods' im- perfection are added their conflicts, both of which are signs of an imperfect stage along the way towards a civilized develop-</page><page sequence="3">188 MICHAEL H. JAMESON JI lively, orignal ancd concise i tdl4 by one of America's foremost scholars The GREEK MIND by WALTER R. AGARD, Professor of Classics, University of Wisconsin In this brief and absorbing study of clas- sical Greece, Professor Agard brings to the fore those problems and attitudes which apply most forcefully to twentieth- century America. In particular, he ex- plores international relations, the rights of minorities, and individual values.

There is no quar- reling between the gods in Sophocles be- cause he has a more static, less "political" view of the world; for him god and man no longer change. On Aeschylus Kitto should gain a wide measure of agreement, although it is an approach that has recently received an exaggerated assault by the "new prim- itivism," as we may call it, of Lloyd-Jones and Page which would deny Aeschylus all originality of religious thought.2 On Soph- ocles he is surely right in stressing order and pattern in the workings of the gods, but does he not go too far in calling this moral and rational law? It has been said that religion is concerned with "the way things are" rather than "the way things ought to be." Sophocles' truly religious quality is the overpowering realization he brings of the way things are in the universe and the way heroic man may conduct him- self in the face of this reality. Each play has its own problems, but unless we are satisfied to see the 0. T. as showing Oedipus' punishment for his hot temper and Iocasta's punishment for her distrust of oracles, we must grant that the gods here are neither rational nor moral; rather, they are. Euripides' prodigality with ideas raises numerous contradictions. For his intellec- tual hospitality Chapouthier borrows Gide's phrase "la disponibilit6 a l'acceuil." His paper is an ingenious and sensitive attempt to distinguish the various tendencies: (1) an acceptance of tradition-witness his un- stinted use of the deus ex machina, his uncritical attitude towards anthropomorph- ism, his delight in ritual, etc. But (2) his critical spirit is apparent in his attacks on the veracity and morality of myth, and of inductive (not intuitive) prophecy. Finally (3) there is his positive assertion of new aspects of the divine. The first essential attribute of god is justice derived from a sense of juridical equality (is6te.s), from a sense of cosmic order (Phoen. 535 ff.) and from an innate moral sense in the heart of the individual (Zeus as the no-uts brot6n, the Erinyes as Orestes' conscience). It is the intimacy of the divine, appearing in the human conscience and as a friend and com- panion (Hippolytus and Artemis), that brings us to the heart of his religious thought. In contrast to Aeschylus and Soph- ocles, the divine is not withdrawn but brought closer to man. The way is pre- pared for the philosopher for whom the problem of god is a matter of individual search. There is much else of value in this paper to increase our sense of loss at the passing of a fine scholar. The main points of W. J. Verdenius' con- cluding paper on Plato are as follows: the predicative character of the Greek view of the divine-something is the6s rather than the6s being defined as something- helps to explain Plato's attribution of di- vinity to various manifestations of the Ideas, from the Idea of the Good down through the individual soul. It also ex- plains the contrast with Christianity-the impersonal character of the divine so that "the more divine the less personal," with the Olympian gods, the daimones, the individual soul coming at the bottom of the scale in that order. Hence, too, the care shown by such aspects of divinity as the Demiurge (the ordering aspect of cos- mic harmony) is a function of its role in giving order to the sensible world; there is no divine love nor concern on the part of divinity for the individual as such, only for the whole. The world of Ideas, in effect, divinity, is self-sufficient. Thus in the pro- gress of man towards divinity the initiative must be man's. But Plato also recognizes the need for mutual cooperation between man and god if man is to move towards god, and hence the place of divine inspira- tion (as in Socrates' sense of mission) which, however, he treats as he does his</page><page sequence="4">GODS AND HEROES 189 own myths and the Olympian gods with a certain playful irony, with exaggerated skepticism or exaggerated piety. Human responsibility in the struggle towards the divine is threatened by fanaticism and ir- rational inspiration. Thus there is a con- stant tension in Plato between the role of man and god. It might be best to call Verdenius' dis- cussion "a Platonic theology" rather than "Plato's theology" for though he shows very well how the use of certain terms is de- termined by the limited context of a par- ticular dialogue, he assumes a unitary view of Plato's philosophy-his thinking did not change, and there was a consistent system behind all his writing with the theory of Ideas at all times implicit. But certainly Verdenius' approach illuminates Plato's work as a whole, and perceptively relates Plato to Greek thought in general and makes contrasts with Christianity at those very points where Platonism and Christian- ity are closest. It is, however, in the connections with previous Greek thought that we notice a problem which is not fully uncovered in these papers: the Greek conception of the divine is at one time praised as personal, anthropomorphic, and hence rational, and at other times as impersonal, intellectual, and no less rational. Greater consideration of the literary elements, perhaps the chief lack in this book, might be of help here. After Homer we are dealing, to state the obvious, with highly individual and creative thinkers; in what way they are original may often escape us but it is the mark of their originality that they remain for us. It is the background that society pro- vides for their individuality that is most wanting (and little use is made in this book of what we do know of it). But in Homer-a vital part of the background that we do possess-we have at once works of art in a distinctive literary tradition where all action is brought on to the heroic stage, and at the same time, especially in the speeches, a source for popular views. The contrast we find in Homer persists: on one side the humanized, personal gods thrive in lyric poetry, in art, in the deus ex machina, in the intimate gods of Eurip- ides, but the philosophers find them too limited by their human scale; on the other side, the impersonal or indeterminate dai- mo*n and the6s of the speeches and of the picture of fate blends superficially with the personalizing tendency in the Theogony, and in the philosophers departs progressively from the personal to animate a self-suf- ficient system. It is the very vigor and persistence of Homeric anthropomorphism which turns Greek philosophy away from the personal and sets up the delicate ten- sion in Plato between the austere, imper- sonal divinity of his system and the divine personality that helps the religious man in his progress. After the severe criticism of the Homeric gods by Xenophanes, and simultaneously with the criticism of Eurip- ides and Plato, Greek thought turned for refreshment to the wider, vaguer, and more fundamental level of popular religious feel- ing where the divine has reality without be- ing confined to set, dramatic character and, depending on need and circumstance, ranges from an extraordinary feeling in man to the very order of the universe. Behind the orig- inality of the writers lie the infinite re- sources of a living "culture religion" (the rather derogatory "inherited conglomerate" of Murray and Dodds). In the end, though Homer and Hesiod "made" the Greek gods, they also destroyed them. The divine broke the confines imposed by them and found its names and forms elsewhere. For long, west- ern culture has known not Greek religion but only Greek mythology and Greek philos- ophy, however theological. MICHAEL H.

The new generation has only the common sense of the university don with which to judge the primitivism it reveals, and, understandably, it fails Aeschylus on every intellectual count.</page></plain_text>
