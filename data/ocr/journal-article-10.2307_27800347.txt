<plain_text><page sequence="1">Global Governance 8 (2002), 305-321 Siting Indiscriminacy: India and the Global Movement to Ban Landmines _ /S?\ _ /. Marshall Beier In the mid-1990s, a unique confluence of activists, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and governments, unprecedented in the history of arms control, took shape as an international movement to ban antipersonnel (AP) landmines. Widely hailed as a triumph of an emergent global civil society, this hitherto unlikely coalition managed in only a few years to first stigmatize AP landmines as a humanitarian scourge and, ultimately, to parlay this re-presentation into a broadly respected ban backed with the force of an international treaty.1 Since then, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL)?a coordinating body through which the mobilizations of NGOs and activists are focused?has continued to work both together with and independent of interested governments to extend the ban and to monitor its implementation. The successes and continuing resonance of the campaign owe much to the generation and propagation of a taboo regarding AP landmines. At the beginning of the 1990s, even Canada, eventually among the most strident advocates of a ban, was dismissive of the suggestion that militaries would, should, or could give up their AP landmine stockpiles. But less than a decade later, these once unexceptional weapons, in widespread use for more than a century as "force multipliers" in war and as "sentinels" or deterrents in peacetime, had become so thoroughly stigmatized that states that had declined to accede to the Ottawa Convention were increasingly defensive about their intransigence. Though neither the weapons themselves nor their more insidious effects had changed appreciably, they had been reconstructed in the public mind as a humanitarian scourge. This discursive watershed, perhaps even more so than the key players themselves, is central to a full understanding of the successes of the movement to ban AP landmines, its limitations, and some uncomfortable implications of its rhetorical devices. Pivotal to the rendering of an AP landmine taboo was the charac terization of mines as indiscriminate?that is, the nature of the weapon, designed to lie in wait until triggered by an unsuspecting victim, is such 305</page><page sequence="2">306 India and the Global Movement to Ban Landmines that civilian populations are as vulnerable as combatants, and often more so. By itself this is ample reason to think that the world would be better off without AP landmines. The pursuit of a universal ban, how ever, left no room for deference to context; the mines themselves were cast as the site(s) of indiscriminacy in case it should otherwise be imag ined that they might be employed without ill effect in some instances. To foreclose the possibility of any such notion, AP landmines have been rendered as a humanitarian scourge in an objective sense independent of context. This powerful rhetorical move precludes thinking about ways in which the indiscriminacy attributed to them might be attenuated in order to preserve some measure of legitimacy regarding their use. It thus lends well to the view that a universal ban is requisite, but it ac complishes this by way of an anthropomorphic turn that, as we shall see, imbues AP landmines with agency. The academic literature on the movement to ban AP landmines is limited. There has been one edited volume2 and a handful of journal ar ticles.3 Scattered mentions can also be found embedded in works deal ing principally with other issues. In what follows, I hope to stimulate further reflection on the siting of indiscriminacy in rhetorical efforts to extend and, conversely, to resist the AP landmines ban. I consider the issue of agency as brought into focus in assessing whether India might be bound under customary international law to accede to the ban. This is a good vantage point inasmuch as the idea of a binding customary norm turns vitally on the degree to which the central validity claims of the AP landmines taboo can be said to have been accepted by India. Moreover, this case is instructive in light of India's own rhetorical machinations, by dint of which it has sought to have restrictions im posed on the use of AP landmines while preserving certain exemptions for itself - a justificatory feat made workable only by a repositioning of the site of agency. Finally, the Indian case points up some important limitations of the taboo as a mechanism for impelling universal adher ence to the ban. Though the successes in broadening the prohibition have been occasioned largely by the ascription of indiscriminacy to AP land mines themselves, the best course for advancing this cause, it will be shown, follows from an acceptance of India's reassignment of agency. AP Landmines and Customary International Law: The Case of India Since the signing of the Ottawa Convention by 122 original signatories in December 1997, the coalition of governments and NGOs that brought</page><page sequence="3">/. Marshall Beier 307 it about have turned their attention to the problem of securing universal adherence. A number of states, many of them notable as major produc ers of AP landmines, have, for various reasons, refused to accede to a ban.4 In some instances, the dissenters have asserted a reserved right to use landmines should they assess some future need; in other cases, ac tual use is current and ongoing. Although efforts to universalize the ban have concentrated primarily on persuading the holdouts to acquiesce, the already widespread adherence has suggested another course: ex ploring the possibility that an emergent customary norm of international law banning AP landmines might be binding on some or all of these states.5 Holding no less authority as international law than formal agree ments between parties (and more so in its strongest articulation as a preemptory norm: jus cogens), customary law may derive from behav iors suggesting acceptance of the central validity claims of a norm, notwithstanding that the norm might be violated in practice. Instructive in this regard are the prohibitions against practices such as torture, piracy, and slave trading-?in each instance, the authority of a univer sally compulsory ban owes to widespread expressions of validity giving rise to a preemptory norm of international law. Thus, the basis for a binding norm might be found inherent in customary acceptance of the AP landmines taboo if not of the negotiated ban. What is especially promising about this approach is that it is suggestive of a possible basis on which to extend the obligation to implement the ban to some of the most intransigent nonsignatories, even though they might persist in the actual use of AP landmines. This builds from an established conception of norm generation that privileges a transgressor's sense that a particular behavior is opinio juris (proscribed) as primary determinant of an obligation to foreswear it?in conventional legal parlance, mens rea (criminal intent or awareness of wrongdoing) is accorded greater significance than actus reus (the pro scribed behavior). The bare fact of even sustained transgressions, then, is relegated to a secondary order of importance. From this perspective, a norm proscribing a given practice may be binding when a transgressor demonstrates an acceptance of its central validity claims even though it might persist in violating these same principles. Thus, in a formulation that speaks directly to the issue of a ban on AP landmines, Susan Be nesch, Glenn McGrory, Cristina Rodriguez, and Robert Sloane argue that a customary norm of international law may be found to be emergent when states cease to defend certain behaviors, notwithstanding that they may not have discontinued them in practice.6 Potentially, a binding cus tomary norm of international law compelling adherence to the ban on AP landmines could be found to inhere in disjunctures between a state's</page><page sequence="4">308 India and the Global Movement to Ban Landmines rhetoric and its actual practice. A state may thus be bound by a custom ary norm mandating a ban if, in their official capacities, its functionar ies evince an acceptance of the central validity claims of the taboo. And this is so notwithstanding that the state might simultaneously persist in stockpiling or even using AP landmines. However, to the extent that it has consistently denied the central validity claims of the taboo, the state might escape obligation for want of demonstrable custom.7 Inasmuch as the movement for a total ban has been highly success ful in its efforts to stigmatize AP landmines, the rhetorical stands of ob jector states have come under considerable pressure not to appear too bellicose from a public relations standpoint. Simultaneously, as Richard Price has observed, there has been a shift in the "burden of proof re garding the question of the continuing military utility of AP landmines from the advocates of a total ban onto those who would oppose or resist it.8 States refusing to accede to the ban have thus been put on the moral defensive even as the onus has been placed on them to demonstrate that a military imperative motivates their intransigence; indeed, the latter has been at least partly a function of the former. These developments have made it increasingly difficult for the holdouts to square their rhet oric with their actual conduct and, to the extent that they jockey to share in the new moral high ground associated with the prohibition on AP landmines, they are apt to find themselves bound by some measure of the obligations that accompany it. As noted above, an important indicator of conditions favorable to the emergence of a customary norm proscribing the use of AP land mines resides in any evidence that a given transgressor state generally upholds the taboo associated with these weapons, and foundational to the taboo is the understanding that AP landmines are a humanitarian scourge due to their indiscriminate nature. The problem, as it has been constructed, is that mines do not distinguish between combatants and noncombatants and, at least so far as those that do not incorporate any self-destruction or self-deactivation safeguards are concerned,9 they also do not distinguish between wartime and peacetime. These failings are compounded by practices such as remote delivery or "scattering" of mines and by the unfortunate circumstance that, even in the case of mines laid by hand, accurate records are too seldom kept for the pur pose of facilitating subsequent demining of affected areas. In short, the taboo associated with AP landmines reflects the premise that they are inherently indiscriminate and that this has had dire human consequences that outweigh any arguable military utility.10 In official statements on the issue, India has advanced what amounts to a qualified rejection of the AP landmines taboo. Although consistently</page><page sequence="5">/. Marshall Beier 309 indicating that it is committed to measures that would put an end to the dire human consequences that give content to the taboo, India continues to defend its use of AP landmines. It remains committed to the position that a total ban can be achieved only with the development of "non lethal alternative technologies that can perform cost-effectively" what it regards as "the legitimate defensive role of anti-personnel landmines" and that, in the meantime, "a phased approach will narrow the scope in which landmines can be used only for the defense of borders."11 The sum of its rhetorical efforts at legitimation hold that India's conduct precludes carnage of the sort associated with the taboo. This line of ar gument amounts to the articulation of a doctrine of "proper" use based on the following principles of conduct: the responsibility for AP land mines is reserved entirely to the army and is not delegated to police or paramilitary forces; use is authorized only to defend borders against hostile incursions, to protect specific locales in border areas, and to pre vent enemy troops from easily clearing defensively laid antitank mines; India does not use mines in internal conflicts;12 mined areas are clearly marked, detailed maps and records are made of the placement of AP landmines, and these have been exchanged with adversaries on the transfer of territory at the cessation of hostilities for the expressed pur pose of aiding the adversaries' subsequent demining efforts;13 remotely delivered mines are not used because they defy effective marking of mined areas;14 and India is committed to the principle that those who lay landmines are responsible for clearing them.15 According to its ex ternal affairs ministry, "India's record in the responsible use of anti personnel landmines has been internationally acknowledged."16 In view of these precautions and its claim that they constitute "re sponsible use," India has not been inclined to accept the argument to relinquish its self-avowed right to produce, stockpile, and use AP land mines. Moreover, and frustrating hopes of finding that it might be bound by a customary norm of international law banning AP landmines, India has been consistent on this point. At the First Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) in 1995, India refused to consider a ban, citing concerns about border defense.17 On 10 December 1996, India did vote in favor of a United Nations Gen eral Assembly (UNGA) resolution calling on all states to work vigor ously toward the conclusion of an agreement banning AP landmines.18 But lest this be mistaken for discontinuity in India's position, it should be noted that the resolution only urged completion of an agreement?it was silent on the substantive content of such an agreement. Indeed, India has always advocated a "phased approach" toward an eventual total ban, but only to the extent that such a program can accommodate</page><page sequence="6">310 India and the Global Movement to Ban Landmines what it regards as its "legitimate defense requirements."19 This position was clearly articulated at a plenary meeting of the Conference on Dis armament in Geneva only a few months after it supported the call for an agreement.20 Moreover, as soon as more substantive elements began to attach to subsequent resolutions, India's voting pattern changed: in 1997, it abstained in a vote on a UNGA draft resolution entitled "Con vention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction";21 in 1998, India abstained in a vote on a subsequent draft resolution of the same title;22 again in 1998, it abstained in a vote on a UNGA resolution that welcomed the addition of new states signatories to the Ottawa Conven tion and invited "all states that have not yet done so to sign or, after entry-into-force, to accede to, the convention";23 and, in 1999, India ab stained in a vote on a draft resolution on the implementation of the Ottawa Convention as well as in a UNGA vote to accept the text of the Ottawa Convention that "would urge all States that had signed but not ratified the Convention to ratify it without delay, and invite all States that had not signed the Convention to accede to it without delay."24 Ad ditionally, in the negotiations over Protocol II of the CCW, India, among others, initially rejected calls for a requirement that nonremotely deliv ered mines incorporate self-destruction or self-deactivation safeguards; India's reluctance was a function of its long-term reliance on non remotely delivered AP landmines for the defense of border areas.25 Fi nally, in 1998, India joined several other countries in blocking a resolu tion by the Nonaligned Movement in support of the Ottawa Convention.26 Still, as its position implies, India has not been at all reluctant to see sortie restrictions put on AP landmines and their use. It has, for ex ample, moved unilaterally to impose a moratorium of unlimited dura tion on the export of landmines and advocates a total ban on their use in internal conflicts.27 In 1996, India signed the Amended Protocol II of the CCW, which imposed certain restrictions on the use of AP land mines but stopped short of a general prohibition. In August 1999, it rat ified the protocol and deposited the instruments of ratification, leaving no doubt as to its continued commitment to the limitations imposed therein. Although it does not go nearly as far as a total ban, the Amended Protocol II does seek to ameliorate, to some extent, the more indiscriminate effects of AP landmine use. Accordingly, India has un dertaken to render its stocks of AP landmines detectable and has begun trials of new self-destruction and self-deactivation devices.28 It should be emphasized that there is no inherent contradiction in India's endorsement of these sorts of safeguards and restrictions. In fact, the high standards of "proper" use to which it ties the legitimacy of AP</page><page sequence="7">f. Marshall Beier 311 landmines in defensive applications are consistent with its support for prohibitions on practices not subjected to the same rigors. The morato rium on transfers seems compatible with India's stance?after all, a wide range of goods are quite regularly prohibited for export by many states because others are not trusted to use them in ways deemed legit imate. And although India's stated desire to see a comprehensive ban implemented at some future time may be read as an indication that it subscribes to the central validity claims of the taboo, by itself it is quite weak evidence of this. This is because India has consistently been clear as to the preconditions for such a ban: that other practical means be found to address its legitimate defensive concerns, a requirement also insisted on by the United States.29 Inasmuch as no aspect of the ban calls into question the legitimacy of militaries as expressions of the right of states to employ violence, there seems little difference between this position and more general hopes that nonlethal alternatives might be found to replace a host of weapons regularly deployed in the course of defensive provisions undertaken by states. Similarly, India's insis tence that AP landmines only be used by militaries in the defense of borders reflects the fact that most military hardware is not regarded as being legitimately usable outside of this context. Here too, so long as the legitimacy of militaries is not called into question, India's position seems quite tenable. By invoking its high standards, India has, in effect, been arguing that landmines are not indiscriminate when subjected to the rigors of proper use to which it adheres. This is reinforced by clear indications that it does regard less disciplined practices in the use of AP landmines as illegitimate on humanitarian grounds. Evidence of this is found in India's ratification of the Amended Protocol II and its advocacy for a ban on remotely delivered mines. More particularly, in a statement at the First Annual Conference of the States Parties to the Amended Pro tocol II, Indian ambassador Savitri Kunadi proclaimed that, despite its opposition to a total ban, India was committed to "ameliorating the hu manitarian crises that have resulted from . . . [the] irresponsible transfer and indiscriminate use of landmines." Especially relevant in the context of India's refusal to disavow its own use of AP landmines, he also called on the international community to "redouble its efforts for mine clear ance and transfer of resources and technologies so that mines that are ac tually causing death and destruction are removed." Further, he offered that his country's position was based on "the belief that the true focus should be the protection of civilian life and livelihood from the menace of landmines." Significantly, he cited this latter conviction as the "guid ing principle" motivating India's support of the Amended Protocol II.30</page><page sequence="8">312 India and the Global Movement to Ban Landmines Ambassador Kunadi's comments echoed those made in 1995 by H. E. Arundhati Ghose, India's permanent representative at the UN of fice in Geneva, who proffered that "the true focus of our efforts here should be the civilian whose life and livelihood must be protected from the menace of landmines." Moreover, he continued, "the only answer to the land mine problem, from this standpoint, lies in attacking the basic causes for the exposure of civilians to this danger." After citing the use of landmines in internal conflicts as one such "basic cause" and reiter ating that "use of anti-personnel landmines should only be permitted for long term defense of borders, perimeters and peripheries of states," Am bassador Ghose outlined the rudiments of a doctrine of proper use: We have succeeded in ensuring that henceforth all anti-personnel landmines which do not possess self-destructing and self-deactivating mechanisms will be used within a perimeter marked area that is monitored by military personnel and protected by fencing or other means, to ensure the effective exclusion of civilians. In our view, these are fairly rigorous restrictions on the use of detectable long-lived emplaced mines. However, as we all know, remotely delivered mines with or without self-destruct mechanisms can neither be accurately perimetered nor can accurate maps be made about their deployment. And more and more mines being produced today are remotely delivered mines. This is why the Indian delegation has consistently called for a complete ban on the use of remotely delivered mines. Mere technical fixes relating to self-destruction or self-deactivation are not enough for every live remotely delivered mine will claim an innocent victim. What is needed is resolute political will to prohibit the use of these weapons.31 Apart from its illustration?vis-?-vis Ambassador Kunadi's remarks more than four years later?of the continuity in India's position over time,32 this earlier text also highlights India's rejection of the central va lidity claims of the taboo. The invocation of elements of a doctrine of proper use, the explicitly expressed purpose of which is to secure civil ians from harm, follows directly from the declaration that the threat to "civilian life and livelihood" is the scourge to be eradicated.33 The con sistency in India's position resides in the fact that it does not accept the rendering of AP landmines as the referent object of the taboo, as agents of dire human consequences. What India seems to regard as taboo, then, is not the use of AP landmines per se, but particular practices that it views as the true source of indiscriminacy. When viewed from this per spective, the mines themselves are not inherently indiscriminate and, significantly, they are divested of rhetorical agency. India's rhetorical solution to the shift of the burden of proof identified by Price has thus been to shift the referent object of the taboo in response.</page><page sequence="9">/. Marshall Beier 313 Landmines, by this logic, are not illegitimate?only such practices as result in dire human consequences. This makes for a very convincing argument, and one with ample precedent in both statutory and custom ary law. If India has been successful in implementing measures that guarantee that the only potential victims of the landmines it implants are invaders, it is difficult to find fault with its claim that this consti tutes legitimate use. It also marks it apart from a central validity claim of the general taboo: the notion of landmines as inherently indiscrimi nate and, consequently, a humanitarian scourge. Moreover, there is ac tually room to argue that India's use of AP landmines may be a rela tively humane alternative to other available means of border defense since its standards of practice dictate that mined areas be clearly marked, thus affording even invaders the opportunity to avoid them. All of this, however, leaves little basis on which to find that a cus tomary norm banning AP landmines is emergent in the Indian context, much less binding. This is not to preclude the possibility that as yet un foreseen changes in terms of opinio juris may precipitate the future ap plicability of such a norm. But, for the present, circumstances do not rec ommend this as a course by which India might be obliged to accede to the ban. Furthermore, advocates of a comprehensive ban might be well advised to resist arguing that such norm-derived obligations are binding on India since they clearly do not fit well and might weaken the credi bility of the case in contexts where it is more relevant and appropriate. An Alternate Route Toward an Indian Ban India's justificatory rhetoric has been remarkably consistent and, at least on the face if it, seems quite convincing. However, the price of its rhetorical persuasiveness is a standard of conduct in the use of AP land mines that appears to be so impracticably high that the legitimacy of its rejection of the ban might not be sustainable. Though, in the end, it pre cisely follows neither the approach of seeking India's assent to the in struments of the voluntary ban nor the course that would implicate it in a binding customary norm of international law proscribing AP land mines, the foregoing analysis nevertheless reveals a potentially com pelling basis on which to argue that India is obligated to reverse its stand. If India stakes the legitimacy of its use of AP landmines on the notion that its particular practices in this regard preclude dire human consequences, then it has implicitly acknowledged the illegitimacy of usages of AP landmines that do have such consequences. This is quite clearly borne out in official expressions of its position, perhaps most</page><page sequence="10">314 India and the Global Movement to Ban Landmines explicitly in the remarks by Ambassadors Ghose and Kunadi. The means by which India has sought to legitimize its own use of AP landmines as against the illegitimacy of improper use makes for a very convincing case at first, but one that may be enormously difficult?if not altogether impossible?to live up to. The whole case for legitimacy turns on the argument that India uses AP landmines in humanitarianly sound ways and that this renders them legitimate in this context. This logic responds to the characterization of AP landmines as a humanitarian scourge and advances the argument that India's practices do not give rise to dire human consequences?that is, only invaders are endangered. The basis for an exemption from an emergent norm banning AP landmine use might reside in India's appar ent "persistent objector" status. But India has itself qualified this posi tion, basing it on a re-siting of indiscriminacy so as not to legitimize the use of mines and improvised explosive devices by local insurgents. A promising issue on which to focus further research, then, is the extent to which even the "proper" use of AP landmines by India can rightly be understood as a humanitarian scourge. If use by India can be shown to have dire human consequences in spite of its best efforts and intentions, its own justificatory rhetoric, ironically, manifests as the basis on which to challenge the legitimacy of its conduct. In raising the rhetorical threshold of acceptable conduct, India has simultaneously raised the standard according to which actual conduct, however responsibly con ceived, can be judged acceptable?the absence of dire consequences that affect the lives and livelihoods of civilians becomes requisite to sustaining legitimacy. That the most conscientiously conceived of pre cautions may have been undertaken to safeguard the well-being of civil ians from harm by AP landmines is made entirely inconsequential if they fail to do so. This is so because India has freed the mines from the rhetorical responsibility implied by the general taboo, staking the legit imacy of its refusal to accede to the ban solely on its own professed ability to use them without dire human consequences. In official statements, it is consistently indiscriminate use that is identified as the source of the scourge from India's perspective.34 In shifting the referent object of the central validity claims of the taboo, India has transformed indiscriminacy from an inherent and impersonal feature of AP landmines themselves into a condition resulting from at tributable acts or omissions on the part of states that would use them. As a result, an issue of agency is introduced where it was not found before, and with it moral liability. The fact that the general ban on AP land mines does not seek to delegitimize state usages of violence through their militaries means that, in this instance, it is an inherently "bad"</page><page sequence="11">/. Marshall Beier 315 weapon that needs to be eradicated. Were it otherwise, it would hardly make sense to condemn AP landmines in isolation from other instru ments of violence, to say nothing of those who would employ them. If there is an agent of the dire human consequences attributed to AP land mines by way of the general taboo, then, it is in the form of a fatal flaw in the weapons themselves that makes their effects intolerably indis criminate. India's justificatory rhetoric, however, absolves AP land mines of this charge and places responsibility for indiscriminacy squarely on those who (mis)use them. This legitimizes the weapon but leaves no room for India to escape culpability for any dire human con sequences that may arise from its (mis)use. It is thus that even accidents become instances in which the reconstituted taboo has been violated and for which the state cannot be absolved of its moral liability. Such is the precarious foundation for avoidance of an obligation under cus tomary law to accede to the ban. To date, no comprehensive survey of the effects of AP landmines in border areas in India is available. There is, nevertheless, a fair amount of evidence to suggest that government-laid mines have not been as benign in their effects on civilians as the rhetorical defense mounted on their be half would have it. Dipankar Banerjee and Mallika Joseph point out that the ad hoc demands of war sometimes do not lend well to proper mark ing and mapping of minefields and suggest that the idea of responsible use has led India to underestimate the potential for dire consequences from its use of AP landmines in a future war.35 Other effects might be more immediate. Civilians may, for example, be compelled by economic necessity to risk death or injury to retrieve livestock, which are not at all dissuaded by warning signs. Indeed, civilians in border villages fall vic tim to mines even when they are marked with warning signs in local lan guages; although mines and improvised explosive devices laid by insur gents are a much larger problem, reports that touch on the issue of civilian casualties caused by government-laid mines in border areas can also be found in media dispatches.36 Of course, the most accurately de tailed minefield maps are useless in instances where rain or shifting snow causes even anchored mines to "drift" out of place.37 Still, India maintains that it "is not a mine afflicted country."38 But despite this claim, research into the extent of the dire consequences suffered by civil ians in border areas as a result of government-laid AP landmines may be the most promising avenue by which India's obligation to accede to the ban might be established?an obligation that would have the virtue of having been forged in terms of India's own making. The fact that India does live up to the practices of what it may deem to be proper use is inconsequential if those practices do not meet</page><page sequence="12">316 India and the Global Movement to Ban Landmines the standards laid out to characterize them as proper in the first place. That dire human consequences might be counter to India's best designs and intentions is also irrelevant; the whole premise of the general taboo is precisely that landmines are indiscriminate and India has based the legitimacy of its use of them on the counterclaim that its practices mean that its mines, in effect, do discriminate. The important value-based commitment that India has accepted and that should bind it, then, is not a ban on the use of landmines, but a ban on the dire human conse quences of landmine use. That this is a position that India has been keen to propagate is also noteworthy, since reasonably wide acceptance would give rise to a customary norm. If India's practices can be shown to be at all unequal to this rigid standard, then, it will have violated a principle that it has both reaffirmed and sought to elevate to (and can thus be assumed to regard as) a norm: that dire human consequences wrought by AP landmines are indefensible. And having put all of its rhetorical eggs in one basket, as it were, India would also be left with out a basis to defend its rejection of the central validity claims of the broader ban. This is in consequence of its straddling stand on the issue by way of which it has endeavored to characterize the indiscriminate uses of AP landmines by some actors (notably, insurgency groups within India) as illegitimate. In so doing, it has marked out its accept ance of the very standards of illegitimacy by which its own practices may be indicted. Conclusion: Embracing the Rhetorical Turn Perhaps the most striking implication of the siting of indiscriminacy and the concomitant siting of agency in the general taboo is that responsi bility for dire human consequences falls on landmines themselves, not on those who laid them. This unfortunate logic is consistent with the fact that the movement to ban landmines has not fundamentally chal lenged the legitimacy of violence committed by states through their mil itaries.39 This has resulted in what amounts to a general moral amnesty for those states that have acceded to the ban; the consequences of their past practices using "indiscriminate" AP landmines are blamed on the instruments rather than the architects. Moreover, the construction of AP landmines as an objective scourge actually renders these very states vic tims of a sort to the extent that they now share in the view that these "bad" weapons have somehow subverted their best designs and inten tions. Now they too have been freed from the scourge of AP landmines,</page><page sequence="13">/. Marshall Beier 317 though they may, even as they stake out a place on the hew moral high ground of the prohibition, continue to menace the lives and livelihoods of civilians in other frightening ways. This bizarre situation is born directly of the fact that the referent object of the general taboo is the weapon itself, not the tragic effects it has on civilian populations. This is certainly not to say, however, that dire human consequences have not been a concern of the movement to ban landmines. On the contrary, the dedicated people who have worked so hard and to such great effect to rid the world of AP landmines have been motivated by a sincere desire to see an end to the suffering with which these weapons have become virtually synonymous. In practice, however, the strategy has been to cast landmines as a humanitarian scourge, as indiscriminate, and by extension, as agents. Of course, the successes of the ban movement owe much to this disaggregation of landmines from other means of state violence and, to be sure, from is sues of state responsibility. It is quite unlikely, after all, that there would be a great many signatories to the Ottawa Convention if it significantly hamstrung military conduct more broadly or raised the specter of state liability. But in spite of whatever practical necessity may have recom mended such an approach, the inference is that landmines are the cause of this carnage, not those who implanted them. The Indian case points up these implications and the practical limi tations to which they give rise. Upon destabilizing the claim that AP landmines are inherently indiscriminate, India has divested the taboo of substance and called into question the logic underwriting the ban. This enables a rendering of landmines as a wholly legitimate part of the arse nals of states. So long as we accept the legitimacy of the use of deadly force by the state, it is difficult to argue with India's protestations to this effect?at least within the terms of the general taboo. The prevailing rhetorical siting of indicriminacy (that is, landmines are indiscriminate and, by extension, have agency) has been very well suited to advancing the ban to this point but may have outlived its usefulness once it runs up against a re-siting of agency/indiscriminacy such as India has done. But India may have done the ban movement a considerable service in shift ing indiscriminacy from landmines to certain practices associated with them and shifting agency from landmines to those who use them. The former construction (the general taboo) was most effective for the pur poses of convincing the states that have voluntarily signed on to the ban to do so; the latter (India's reconstituted taboo) may be much more ap propriate if the task at hand now is compelling the holdouts to acquiesce. In the end, India's rhetoric is virtually unimpeachable except, iron ically, on its own terms?it is itself the author of the very standards by</page><page sequence="14">318 India and the Global Movement to Ban Landmines which the legitimacy of its use of AP landmines is called into question. But its transformation of the taboo from indiscriminate landmines to landmines used indiscriminately signals more than that an alternate ap proach is in order to impel India's acquiescence to the ban. It also alerts us to some unwelcome implications of the rhetoric thus far deployed in furtherance of the aims of the movement to ban landmines. These com promises were arguably worthwhile so long as they aided in persuading states to voluntarily accede. Now that the course that necessitated them appears to be reaching its limits, however, they might be judged rather less sympathetically. If the foregoing analysis, like India's response to the call for a universal ban on AP landmines, unsettles prevailing sitings of agency and indiscriminacy, it also suggests that it might be time for the movement to ban landmines to undergo a conceptual retooling. The general taboo does not lend well to a prohibition on other state exercises of violence affecting civilian populations, so that one is left to wonder where we would go from a total ban on landmines. India's reconstituted taboo, though, holds considerable promise as the basis of a norm pro scribing a range of state behaviors imperiling the well-being of civilians. Having convinced those states that seem susceptible of being convinced, the movement can now afford to reprivilege dire human consequences? the referent that induced its adherents to work toward a ban in the first place?as the referent object of the taboo. Indeed, as this course may be better suited to responding to key intransigents like India, we might rea sonably conclude that it can ill afford not to. ? Notes J.
