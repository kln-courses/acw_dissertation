<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Ranlett ' CHECKING NATURE'S DESECRATION": LATE-VICTORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION* MEMBERS OF "THE SELBORNE SOCIETY AND KINDRED FRATERNITIES," JAMES Bryce told Selbome's annual meeting in 1900, "were endeavoring to defend Nature against those plagues and pests which sought to worry her out of existence." They were, in a word - although in a word sel- dom used in that sense in 1900 - environmentalists. "If Societies like their own had been in existence in years past," Bryce continued, "much might have been effected in the way of checking Nature's desecration." Organization, even apparently duplicate organization, was and would remain essential: "[T]he existence of so many Societies with cognate aims was a great source of encouragement. . . . [T]hough they were largely made up of the same members . . . still it looked well. ... for with such a combination they could produce the impression that the attention of the whole country was directed to the question at issue."1 Virtually the same speech could have been derived from the personal experience of Selborne's president, Sir John Lubbock, or of vice presidents Robert Hunter and Hardwicke Rawnsley, or of Rich- ardson Evans, William Blake Richmond, Octavia Hill, and George John Shaw-Lefevre, associates of the Selborne officers in a host of voluntary environmental societies, each working on its own chosen turf "to defend Nature against those plagues and pests which sought to worry her out of existence." An examination of the contributions of the Selbornians and their colleagues will serve as a vehicle which, while illustrating the steadily increasing extent of the environmental o Research for this article was supported in part by a grant from the Research Founda- tion of the State University of New York. 1 Nature Notes, 11 (1900oo), 107-09.

I To prevent development upon open spaces near London, George John Shaw-Lefevre and a group of friends, meeting in his Inner Temple chambers, established in 1865 the Commons Preservation So- ciety. The foundation of that organization identifies a turning point in the public perception of society's relationship to nature. Previously the law of commons had been based on the assumption that open, undeveloped land was "waste" and that economic development of such land was in the public interest. In the early 186os proposals made for building on Putney Heath, Wimbledon Common, Hampstead Heath, and Epping Forest were fully in accord with the existing atti- tude of the courts, but they conflicted with a new and competing set of assumptions which was coming to give higher priority to the maintenance of commons as open spaces - "lungs for the metropolis" - and reservoirs for the renewal of the human soul.2 The new sensibility which brought forth the Commons Preser- vation Society was ably represented by the Society's honorary solicitor for fourteen years, Robert Hunter. By guiding the Society through a series of brilliant legal victories, Hunter helped to redirect the law affecting common land so as to emphasize preservation and public access rather than development.3 Putney Heath, Wimbledon Common, Hampstead Heath, and Epping Forest were saved, and the Society, keeping an active eye out for new threats to other commons, began a long campaign to abrogate those provisions of the 1235 Statute of Merton which still appeared to supply a legal route toward the de- struction of commons. The statute was virtually repealed in 1893 (Shaw-Lefevre, pp. 11, 355). It was through the Commons Preservation Society that Shaw- Lefevre, Hunter, and Society charter member Bryce first made the ac- 2 G.

This failure convinced her of the importance of open spaces, and membership in the Commons Preservation Society fol- lowed. Her commitment, gradually widening in scope, later brought her into the center of the environmental movement.4 In 1877, twelve years after the organization of the Commons Preservation Society, William Morris established the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB). Bryce, Sir John Lubbock (an early member of the Commons Preservation Society) and John Ruskin were among the first to join the new organization. By 1900 there were 435 members. The SPAB hoped to promote authentic maintenance of the fabric of England's medieval buildings, especially its parish churches, as an alternative to the current enthusiasm for a type of restoration which Morris considered tantamount to the destruction of the nation's architectural heritage.5 Although the SPAB was not con- cerned directly with nature, its appeal paralleled that of the Com- mons Preservation Society. In the mind of a later generation it would be considered, along with the nature conservation societies, as one of the environmental organizations. Bryce developed this parallel in his address to the Selborne Society in 19oo: "He thought it very desirable that those Societies which aimed at the preservation of Nature should be linked in broad sympathy with those which had for their object the care of historic monuments. Their aims were mainly identical - the retention for posterity of the beautiful native spots and splendid monuments of their ancestors." Bryce maintained that "[t]he connection of natural history with politi- cal history was a very close one. Whoever desired to study natural evolution must also study the methods of man acting along with it. They both pertained to the state in which the country was before the great industrial tide swept over it as a flood." On the same occa- sion Hunter spoke about both the effort to preserve "the beauties of 'William Thomson Hill, Octavia Hill: Pioneer of the National Trust and Housing Re- former (London: Hutchinson, 1956), p. 117; Dorothy M.

In the 188os the two societies cooper- ated to defeat a plan to demolish London Charterhouse and worked together in efforts to save Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn (NN, 1 [1890], 173-174). The first Ancient Monuments Act (1882), sponsored by Lubbock, had been squeezed into the parliamentary timetable at the insistence of Shaw-Lefevre, who was then First Commissioner of Works in the Gladstone government.7 The close links were still acknowledged and utilized as late as 1947 when the Huxley Com- mission on Wild Life Conservation pointed to the precedent of the Ancient Monuments Act as justification for the state protection of natural sites. "There is but a narrow gap," the Commission argued, "between these and the [nature] reserves, which are both ancient monuments and living museums - a living embodiment of the past history of the land."8 When Lord Brabazon, propagandist of clean living and physical health for the masses, founded the Metropolitan Public Gardens As- sociation (MPGA) in 1882, Shaw-Lefevre and Bryce became members, as Lord Mount-Temple, Lubbock, and Richardson Evans did later. Brabazon's MPGA, working for thirty-five years from headquarters in the Brabazon-Meath town residence in Lancaster Gate, sought to convert derelict land, especially disused burial grounds, "to provide breathing and resting places for the old and playgrounds for the young in the midst of densely populated localities, especially in the east and south of London." By 1888, the MPGA had enrolled 680 members.9 A similar activity had been pursued since 1876 by Octavia Hill's Kyrle Society, of which William Morris and Robert Hunter were both members.10 Brabazon, however, had come to feel that "the work is 6NN, 11 (1900), 103, io8; see also Robert Hunter, The Preservation of Places of Interest or Beauty (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1907). 7R.

Once incumbents no longer felt the lure of profit, few continued to oppose conversion of disused burial grounds for the purpose of public resort.13 Both Kyrle and the MPGA sought with success to make their influence felt beyond London. Kyrle sponsored the formation of as- sociated Kyrle Societies in Birmingham, Bristol, Leicester, Liverpool, and Nottingham.14 The MPGA, in turn, shared information and ideas with the Open Spaces Committee (established in 1880) of the Man- chester and Salford Sanitary Association; was in contact with the Norwich Open Spaces Society and a similar society in Belfast; and acted as sponsor of the new Birmingham Playgrounds, Open Spaces and Playing Fields Society early in the twentieth century. Overseas, it exchanged reports with the Park Commissioners of Boston, Mas- sachusetts, answered questions posed by similar bodies in Brooklyn and Philadelphia, and exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposi- tion in Chicago in 1893 (MPGA, Report, 1887, pp. 21-22; 1892, p. 14; 893, pp. 15-16; 1902, p. 10; 1906, p. 25). Foundation of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association in 1882 focused attention on efforts to bring elements of the country to the city. By contrast, the establishment of the Lake District Defense Society in the following year focused attention on efforts to prevent urban civilization, as represented specifically by the railway, from destroying a particularly revered tract of country.

Hardwicke Rawnsley, who had fallen under Ruskin's influence at Oxford, had just taken up residence in the Lake District in the early 188os when plans were announced for a railway from Braithwaite, near Keswick, to Buttermere, and for a rival line from the coast through Ennerdale. Rawnsley reacted in 1882 by founding the Derwent Water and Borrowdale Defense Com- mittee to oppose the schemes. His work in opposition was supported by the Commons Preservation Society and the Kyrle Society. Contact with the former inaugurated Rawnsley's years of fruitful cooperation with Shaw-Lefevre, Bryce, and Hunter. Contact with Kyrle, on the other hand, merely cemented an old acquaintance: Rawnsley and Hill had been introduced by Ruskin in 1875 when Rawnsley had been lay-chaplain to the Newport Market Refuge in Soho.15 The joint efforts of Kryle, the Commons Society, and Rawns- ley's committee were successful. Both railway schemes were with- drawn. Victory was celebrated by Rawnsley's foundation in 1883 of the Lake District Defense Society whose objective was "to protect the Lake District from those injurious encroachments upon its scenery which are from time to time attempted from purely commercial or speculative motives, without regard to its claim as a national recreation ground" (E. Rawnsley, p. 52). Once again Rawnsley received pledges of support from the Kyrle Society and the Commons Preservation Society, 'although local businessmen, in opposition, founded the Lake District Association to promote development (McGaffey, pp. 195-196). The next railway assault on the Lake District was the Winder- mere-Ambleside project of 1887, an abbreviated version of the longer project blocked by Ruskin in the 187os. This time Bryce conducted the successful parliamentary campaign to prevent the extension to Amble- side (McGaffey, p. 203). In the next decade Bryce was to use his par- liamentary position to incorporate into the Light Railways Act of 1896 a clause requiring that the preservation of historical buildings and natural scenery be considered during the summary procedure for 13 William Wordsworth, A Guide Through the District of the Lakes in the North of England (1835; rpt. ed., New York: Greenwood, 1968), p. 32; Eleanor F.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 202</page><page sequence="7">LATE-VICTORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION light railway authorization (National Trust, Report, March-July 1896, p. 24). About the same time Rawnsley was to find himself fighting, un- successfully, to prevent the construction of the Snowdon mountain railway. The railway, he argued, would degrade "one of the chief glories of our country" to "the level of a tea garden." Rawnsley, troubled by the desecration at Snowdon and fearful of the precedent established - "the mountain railway craze . . . spreads rapidly" - felt "that the time has come for the nation to demand the interference of its legis- lature. Why should there not be a commissioner or commissioners appointed by parliament to safeguard the national interest in scenery, and to see that the recreation grounds and the inspiration grounds of the people are not jeopardized by the will or whim of private owners, or the selfishness of speculators?" (NN, 5 [1894], 240). Rawnsley's thoughts on the Snowdon railway might appear to trace the lines of later development of the National Parks movement, but in fact the roots of that movement are usually identified in the Access to Mountains campaign launched by Bryce in 1884. Access to Mountains was the only one of Bryce's continuing environmental ac- tivities in which he assumed a role of personal leadership rather than one of conspicuous spokesman for causes championed primarily by others. Ever since his youthful explorations in the uplands of western Scotland, Bryce had been an avid outdoorsman, rambler, and botanist. In 1870, during his first trip to America he had vigorously assaulted the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and in 1876 he had made a highly publicized solo ascent of Mount Ararat, a feat which led to his election to the Alpine Club in 1879. Less grandly he became a member of the Sunday Tramps, an intellectuals' rambling group which coalesced around Leslie Stephen in 1879.16 Hill-walkers in underdeveloped areas of northern England and Scotland were not welcomed by landowners, who with reason worried about fires, open gates, dogs chasing sheep, and litter (Selborne Society Letters, o1 [1887], 121). As Lord Elcho was to say in an 1892 debate, visitors to beauty spots in the Scottish Highlands brought no money for paid admissions and left nothing behind "except sandwich paper and broken ginger-beer bottles" (The Times, 5 March 1892, p. 1o). It was not surprising that ramblers frequently found paths closed and accustomed access to wild lands denied. For years the rambling '6 Allan B. Lefcowitz and Barbara F.

As early as 1826 the Man- chester Society for the Preservation of Ancient Footpaths, "a pleasant association ... of Tories, Whigs, and Radicals," had been founded, with some assistance from the Manchester Guardian.l7 A parliamentary enquiry in 1833 was told that the Society, using the common law of rights of way, had "been effectual" in keeping open to the public "many footpaths which would otherwise have been stopped up."18 In the Lake District, the Keswick and District Footpaths Association had been founded in 1856 (E. Rawnsley, p. 71). Early in the 188os the Scottish Rights of Way and Recreation Society and, in England, the National Footpath Preservation Society came into being almost simultaneously. The Scottish Society was designed "for the purpose of preserving and recovering for the public use of such legal rights of way as are in danger of being interrupted or of being permanently lost," including the "rights of the public along the seashore, and by the sides of the rivers and lochs, and over the mountains of Scotland" (Commons Pres- ervation Society, Report, 1883-84, p. 13). The English Society "was formed for the preservation of ancient foot and bridle paths, and all other rights of way by land and water. . ." (NN, 1 [1890], 98). Realization that the common law of rights of way was not always a sufficient or convenient defence led Bryce to introduce into parliament in 1884 the first Access to Mountains bill, designed to pre- vent landowners from restricting public access to undeveloped land in Scotland and the north of England. Although the bill made no progress in this first attempt, Bryce kept the issue alive in parliament where he was assisted by the publicity emanating from Rawnsley's revival in the Lake District of the moribund Keswick and District Footpaths Association. Rawnsley, in an effort to prevent landowners from closing footpaths giving access to Skiddaw, again left his com- fortable vicarage to lead hundreds of demonstrators who removed barriers erected by the landowners. He carried the campaign further afield by speaking at public meetings in London, Oxford, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Bristol, and was buttressed by a statement from Hill's Kyrle Society that failure at Keswick would be a precedent endangering footpaths everywhere. The Keswick case went to court 17 Arthur Redford and Ina Stafford Russell, The History of Local Government in Man- chester, 3 vols.

It was not until 1939, however, that an Access to Mountains Act was finally placed upon the statute book (The Times, 5 March 1892, p. 9-10; Bracey, p. 215). That act, generally recognized as the first legislative step toward the foundation of National Parks in Britain, accounts for Bryce's posthumous recognition as founder of the National Parks movement.20 Long before the achievement of its legislative victory, the National Footpath Preservation Society had surrendered its independence by amalgamating in 1899 with the Commons Preser- vation Society, which then became the Commons and Footpaths Preservation Society.21 II Toward the end of 1885 two organizations soon to be linked together, the Selborne League and the Plumage League, came into existence. The Selborne League - founded by George Musgrave, a Fellow of the Zoological Society and of the Royal Geographical Society, and his wife - was named to recall the interests of the eighteenth - century naturalist, Gilbert White of Selbome. It embraced a variety of objectives: preservation of birds of beautiful plumage, of rare birds, and of wild flowers; introduction of harmless plants; and preservation of forests and other places of popular resort. The Plumage League was 19 H. E. Bracey, People and the Countryside (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1970), p. 215; E. Rawnsley, pp. 71-72. 20J. B.

Its members were asked to agree that "the display of the dead and distorted bodies" of birds was "obnoxious . . . to good taste" and to pledge to observe "in our dress . . . the law of kindness." Only ostrich plumes, obtainable without harm to the bird, were to be used on the millinery of Plumage League members.22 The Plumage League was founded by the Rev. Francis Orpen Morris and Lady Mount-Temple (Selborne Magazine, 1 [1888], 96; Doughty, pp. 95-96). F. O. Morris, a Yorkshire clergyman, enthusiastic anti-Darwinian naturalist, and fervent writer of letters to the editor, had been concerned with the protection of birds since the 186os. He had taken a hand in the organization of England's first bird protection society, established at Bridlington near Flamborough Head, where thousands of seabirds had been routinely slaughtered for sport. Pas- sage in 1869 of England's first Sea Birds Preservation Act was in part attributable to Morris. He then organized the Association for the Protection of British Birds, which, working with allies within the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, achieved passage of stronger bird protection legislation in 1872 and 1876.23 Morris also became active in the antivivisection movement, rejoicing when Ruskin, one of his correspondents, resigned his chair at Oxford to protest the university's refusal to end experimentation on animals.24 Morris's pressing of RSPCA literature on Catherine Smithies had inspired her to establish the Bands of Mercy movement through which children were to learn kindness to animals.25 Lady Mount-Temple, spiritualist, vegetarian, and friend of Rus- kin and Hill, had been encouraged in the establishment of the Plumage 22 Selborne Magazine, 1 (1888), 79, 95-96; Robin W.

Lord Mount-Temple, associated with the Com- mons Preservation Society since its foundation, had been active in the passage of the Metropolitan Commons Act of 1866 and in the saving of Epping Forest. As First Commissioner of Works in the second Palmerston government, he had given to William Morris an important commission for redecoration of rooms at St. James's Palace. Mount- Temple, who eventually became an MPGA member, had also used his ministerial position to improve planting in London parks. By dis- tributing flowers from the parks to the poor he had anticipated Kyrle Society activities by a decade.26 It was immediately obvious in December 1885 that the Mus- graves's Selborne League and the Morris-Mount-Temple Plumage League had overlapping objectives and clientele. Consequently the two Leagues amalgamated in January 1886 as the Selborne Society (Selborne Magazine, 1 [1888], 96; Doughty, p. 96). Its full title, the Selborne Society for the Preservation of Birds, Plants, and Pleasant Places, did not exhaust the range of its activities, which came to in- clude as well involvement in footpaths and commons, in ancient monu- ments, in nature study, and in rambling.27 Embarrassment about its roots in the sentimentalized anthropomorphic regions of the kindness to animals movement, which many environmentalists wished to keep at arm's length, led to a de-emphasis of that part of the Society's inheritance. Consequently, by 1891, F. O. Morris would no longer acknowledge his role in the foundation of Selborne.28 Selborne officials still recognized that the wide range of objectives remaining necessarily left the Society's activities unfocused.

Selborne published the popular nature study journal, Nature Notes, which, in addition to circulation to members, was placed in various school libraries and even enjoyed a limited sale by booksellers (NN, 11 [1900], 139; Selborne Magazine, 2 [1889], 188). The Society supported the preservation of open spaces, agitating successfully, for example, in conjunction with the Commons Preservation Society, the Kyrle Society, and the MPGA, to "save" the terrace gardens at Rich- mond and parts of nearby Sudbrook and Petersham Parks (Selborne Society Letters, 4 [1887], 50; NN, 1 [1890], 15-16, 32; 6 [1895], 93, 120). It supported legislation, including specifically the Access to Mountains bill - "Selbornians will use their utmost efforts to put pres- sure upon their representatives in Parliament" - and extracted from the secretary of war a promise that regimental plumes would no longer be obtained through the sacrifice of birds (NN, 1 [1890], 68; 9 [1898], 126; o1 [1899], 61). It conducted hundreds of countryside outings and rambles. The honorary secretary of the Southampton and New Forest branch of the Selborne Society, in formulating his own job descrip- tion, usefully summarized one view of Selborne work: "There is ample opportunity for an enthusiast to lecture, to write in the local press, to organise bands of mercy, to influence County Council and Parish Councils, to organise Selbornian teaching in schools. . ." (NN, 8 [1897], 240). Respectability of leadership, intended to wipe out any tinge of the unscientific extremism of the antivivisectionists and their allies among the founders, was assured when Lord Tennyson consented to become first president of the Selborne Society. He was replaced on his death in 1892 by the scientific popularizer Sir John Lubbock, later Lord Avebury. Vice presidents came to include Bryce, Hunter, William Morris, and Rawnsley. By 1904 Selborne membership exceeded 1,700 (NN, 1 [1890], 11; 8 [1897], 140, 151; 16 [1905], 128). Selborne had been named to recall the interests of Gilbert White in the observation of nature. Earlier Kyrle had been named to recall the interests of John Kyrle, celebrated by Pope as the "Man of Ross," who through his personal endeavors had beautified his own surroundings. When in 1893 Richardson Evans of Wimbledon, a mem- ber of the MPGA and friend of Octavia Hill, organized a society to fight against excesses in public advertising, he similarly "cast about ... for some eponymous hero, someone who had distinguished himself VICTORIAN STUDIES 2o8</page><page sequence="13">LATE-VICTORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION 209 in past times by his zeal against defacements. But historical records disclosed (as might have been surmised) that till the reign of Queen Victoria there never was a crisis that called for such a deliverer." The new society, then, was christened by Evans as the Society for Check- ing the Abuses of Public Advertising, a title which, although "long and cumbrous" and of admitted "infelicity," aptly described its objectives.29 The Society was aimed primarily at the recent burgeoning of the plague of outdoor advertisements such as those which Lord Rosebery described as having "entirely ruined" the landscape along the railway south of Manchester (ABW, 3 [1894], 89). Selborne's Nature Notes found advertising boards stretching in an almost con- tinuous chain paralleling the railway between London and Oxford. "These hideous erections, usually of tin, with vile glazed inscriptions setting forth the names of some popular remedy, are planted in the fields, so that you shall scarcely be able to glance out of window at the country without seeing one or more of them" (NN, 4 [1893], 81-82). The Society determined to check "the abuse of the practice of spec- tacular advertising" so as to protect and promote "the picturesque simplicity of rural and river scenes, and the dignity and propriety of our larger towns" (NN, 4 [1893], 82). From the outset the approach was clearly legal and legislative. A Society committee as early as May 1893 was investigating "the pres- ent condition of the law with regard to the powers of control and the rating of hoardings" and at the new organization's first general meeting in July 1893, a draft advertisement regulation bill was submitted to the membership (NN, 4 [1893], 82; ABW, 1 [1893], 7). By November 1893 the Society was contemplating regulatory legislation calling for special rating on advertising (to make it economically unproductive) and the "prohibition of advertising on structures built or bought by public funds" (so as to prevent a recurrence of such blasphemies as the use of Nelson's column as a projection screen for lantern slide advertisements).30 The possibility of a cautious boycott was also mooted: "A common understanding that the members will each at his own discretion abstain (as far as may be) from using commodities which he personally feels are advertised in an offensive way, or patron- 29 MPGA, Report, 1893, p. 125; Hill, p. 151; Richardson Evans, The Age of Disfigure- ment (London: Remington, 1893), pp. 96-98. 30 ABW, 1 (1893), 27; Richardson Evans, An Account of the Scapa Society (London: Constable, 1926), p. 72.

By the end of its first year the new Society, already generally referred to by its acronym SCAPA, boasted 753 members including Bryce, Hunter, William Morris, Lord Brabazon (now the Earl of Meath), and Rawnsley. Shaw-Lefevre joined in 1895.31 In January 1896, at a SCAPA meeting at which William Morris delivered his last public address, another SCAPA member, the artist William Blake Richmond (Ruskin's successor in the Slade Professorship at Oxford and a colleague of Morris in the SPAB and in the arts and crafts move- ment) told of a new advertising assault: "I was in my garden and I heard sudden reports of artillery; presently from the sky fell masses of green and red paper, advertising a tooth powder. ... It took my gardener a week to collect all these pieces of paper which were blown out of the guns into my garden."32 There was, of course, another side of the advertising question, well represented since the 186os by the United Billposters' Association. The advertising industry established a parliamentary committee to block SCAPA's legislative efforts, and effective progress toward a regulatory bill in fact began only in 1903, when SCAPA met with the United Billposters' Association and the London Billposters' Protective Association to attempt to draft legislation acceptable to both sides. That approach was to lead in 1907 to the passage of the Advertisements Regulation Act, which permitted local authorities to make bylaws regulating those forms of public advertising which SCAPA had identi- fied as most obnoxious.33 In the autumn of 1893, a few months after SCAPA's foundation, Hill, Hunter, and Rawnsley, supported by Bryce, Richmond, Shaw- Lefevre, and others, established the provisional council of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. The idea was not new. In 1884 a Deptford landowner, neighbor to an Ecclesiastical Commission housing estate managed by Hill, had offered to give "to the public" two acres of land and a "curious old building," but it Richardson Evans, printed letter, Dec. 1909, p. 1; ABW: 1 (1893), 32, 36-38; 2 (1894), 72; 5 (1895), 46; 6 (1896), 12. 2 The Unpublished Lectures of William Morris, ed.

The incident was the inspiration for Robert Hunter's "Suggestion for the Better Preservation of Open Spaces," a paper read to the Social Science Congress at Birmingham in September 1884. Hunter advocated "the formation of a corporate company" to acquire "properties to which common rights are attached . . . manors . . . square gardens, dis-used church yards and burial grounds. . . with a view to the protection of the public interest in the open spaces of the country."34 Copies of Hunter's proposal were distributed to Commons Society, Kyrle, and MPGA members, and in early 1885 a meeting to discuss the proposal was held at Bryce's London house. Hill floundered about for a corporate title and came up with "Commons and Gardens Trust, for Accepting, Holding, Preserving and Purchasing Open Spaces for the People in Town and Country." Hunter countered with "National Trust" and the short title stuck. A share list for the sale of ?1 shares in the scheme was opened, but after the promising start the plan languished, in part because Shaw-Lefevre, afraid of diverting attention from his Commons Preservation Society, was not enthusiastic.35 Around 1890 Hunter and Hill established the Kent and Surrey Committee of the Commons Preservation Society, which worked vigorously to prevent landowners from blocking public rights of way in the district where the two maintained country homes, but which also created one more activity diverting attention from the apparently still-born National Trust (Hill, p. 148; Kent and Surrey Committee, Report, 1911-12, p. 3). The project was taken from limbo in 1893 when Rawnsley in the Lake District noted that the Falls of Ladore and the island of Grasmere, both suitable as public reservations, were for sale. In- vestigation revealed to him, as it had to Hunter in 1884, that there was no suitable legal vehicle for public ownership of such places. Rawnsley came to London to consult with Hill and Hunter, his previous contacts in the Commons Preservation Society, and the three in concert dusted off the National Trust plans of the previous decade (E. Rawnsley, p. 1o8). The resultant provisional council sponsored 34 R.

The Trust's objectives were: to promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the Nation, of land and tenements (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest; and as regards lands, to preserve (so far as practicable) their natural aspect, features, and animal and plant life; and for this purpose to accept from private owners of property, gifts of places of interest or beauty, and to hold the lands, houses and other property thus acquired, in trust for the use and enjoyment of the nation. (National Trust, Report, 30 April 1895, p. 4). Hill wrote in anticipation that "the work would be delightful to one who cared for it: all the good results of the Commons and Footpaths work with little or no fighting. On the contrary, calling on the generous and good people" (Maurice, p. 538). Going to work with enthusiastic cheerfulness, the Trust actually acquired its first property, the cliff at Barmouth, two months prior to official incorporation (Maurice, p. 533). By 1899 the Trust owned forty-one acres of land and had en- rolled 200 members.36 Sir William Blake Richmond, neighbor at Hammersmith of his friend William Morris and a member of Morris's SPAB as well as of SCAPA and the new National Trust, was instrumental in the founding in 1898 of yet another environmental organization, the Coal Smoke Abatement Society (CSAS).37 The Society grew out of a meeting held in Onslow Gardens in early December 1898, at which the Earl of Meath, of the MPGA, presided and Richmond delivered the main address (CSAS Minute Book, 4-6; Standard, 6 Dec. 1898). Smoke pollution had been of long, but intermittent, concern. John Evelyn had written against it in the seventeenth century; early in the industrial revolution James Watt had collaborated in research to combat the medical effects of the atmospheric pollution to which Watt's steam engines had contributed; in the mid-nineteenth century Lord Palmers- ton had sponsored a series of acts designed to regulate smoke in London; and Octavia Hill had been instrumental in the organization of an antismoke exhibition held at South Kensington in the winter of 36 National Trust, Report by the Council's Advisory Committee on the Trust's Consti- tution, Organization and Responsibilities [Benson Report] (London: London National Trust, 1968), p. 20. 37 Philip Henderson, William Morris: His Life, Work, and Friends (New York: McGraw- Hill, 1967), pp. 137, 226, 228, 379; ABW, 1 (1893), 38; National Trust, Report, 1914-15, P. 1. VICTORIAN STUDIES 212</page><page sequence="17">LATE-VICTORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION 1881-82.38 The concept of the exhibition had been supported by Rich- mond's letter in The Times of 18 October 1880 and by his scheduled appearance at a public meeting held at the Mansion House in January 1881 (The Times, 6 Jan. 1881, p. 11). The exhibition had led to the founding in the summer of 1882 of the National Smoke Abatement Institution, which was active in seeking enforcement of the smoke control statutes during the early 188os but ceased to exist after 1887.39 Richmond's new smoke abatement society of 1898 was designed primarily to promote enforcement of the existing smoke control legis- lation, especially in the metropolis - although, as Richmond explained to his colleagues at the Onslow Gardens meeting, public awareness of the problem must be stirred before the authorities could be expected to pursue enforcement energetically (Standard, 6 Dec. 1898). To show what could be done the Society hired its own paid inspector, following the route pioneered by the Royal Society for the Preven- tion of Cruelty to Animals, whose inspectorate, "a sort of private police force," had grown from three members in 1837 to 120 in 1897 (Harrison, "Animals," 793; Harrison, "Religion," 102). The Leeds Sanitary Aid Society had established its own smoke control inspectorate in 1894.40 In 1903 the CSAS inspector made 2,000 observa- tions of smoke pollution, which led to the detection of 1,460 cases of nuisance and 1,298 official complaints (CSAS, Fifth Report, 1903, p. 3). By that year the Society's example had encouraged the Westminster corporation to appoint two smoke inspectors and the City, Southwark, and Lambeth one each (CSAS, Fifth Report, 1903, p. 4). Within its first decade the Society also launched a useful collaborative effort in research and publication with the Lancet (of which the joint editors - the Wakeleys, father and son - were Society committee members), sponsored with the Royal Sanitary Institute a four day smoke abate- ment conference and exhibition, inaugurated at the Borough Poly- technic Institute a training program for stokers, corresponded with manufacturers and local authorities in the United States, Belgium, 38 Max Nicholson, The Environmental Revolution: A Guide for the New Masters of the World (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1970), p. 142; Henry W.

Richardson Evans of SCAPA was listed as a So- ciety benefactor (CSAS, Fifth Report, 1903, p. 10). Rawnsley, although he had referred to himself in 1890 as "one of the wicked anti-smoke gents," does not appear to have joined.42 Ruskin's enthusiastic blessing was communicated by Ruskin's niece, who may merely have assumed what thoughts existed within the old man's clouded mind (Standard, 6 Dec. 1898). Lawrence Chubb, a young protege of Hill and Hunter in the Kent and Surrey Committee who had served briefly as the first salaried secretary of the National Trust and had then moved on to begin more than fifty years' service with the Commons Preservation Society, became secretary (The Times, 19 Feb. 1948, p. 7). By 1903 the Society numbered about 300 members (CSAS, Fifth Report, 1903, PP. 9-13). III Intended as a capstone for the whole emerging environmental structure, a two-tier organization was created, at least on paper, in a meeting held in a House of Commons committee room on 23 June 1898. Bryce, who presided, in his introductory remarks said that "during the last few years there had been a growing sense of the desirability of making provision in the interests of the public for the preservation of open spaces and commons, and not a less remarkable desire for preserving all objects of beauty and everything with his- torical associations." He continued, "These tendencies have given rise to the formation of a considerable number of societies, and to some it 41 Arnold Marsh, The Story of the National Society for Clean Air (London: National Society for Clean Air, 1959), pp. 2-3; CSAS, untitled prospectus. 19ol, p. 1 and Ninth Report, 1907, pp. 3, 6-7; William Wise, Killer Smog: The World's Worst Air Pollution Disaster (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1968), p. 44. As a result of mergers and changes of name, the Society has since 1958 been the National Society for Clean Air. 42 H. D. Rawnsley, "Sunlight or Smoke?" Contemporary Review, 57 (1890), 523. VICTORIAN STUDIES 214</page><page sequence="19">LATE-VICTORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION had occurred that it would be well to associate together for common action" (NN, 9 [1898], 126-127). As Bryce said, the idea of cooperation among societies was not new. In 1887 the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, which included open spaces and air and water pollution among its interests, had suggested creation of "a well considered and organized system of cooperation between existing societies" (Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, Report, 1886, cover, p. 4; MPGA, Report, 1887, pp. 21-22). In 1888 the Earl of Meath had presided at a meeting, where those in attendance included Mount-Temple, Lubbock, and Bryce, at which a Parliamentary Social Reform Committee was established to function as a nonparty social reform group focusing parliamentary at- tention on a wide range of activities including air and water pollution and public parks. Meath became chairman of the Committee, and Lord Monkswell, later chairman of the London County Council's Parks Committee and figurehead chairman of the Kyrle Society, became one of its three secretaries (Meath, Memories, pp. 254-255; The Times, 4 March 1909, p. 19; 23 Dec. 19o9, p. 9). Although over 200 MPs joined the Social Reform Committee in its two years of activity, little of en- vironmental significance had come from the coordinating initiatives of the late 188os (Meath, Memories, p. 256). It was Richardson Evans of SCAPA who was behind the effort in 1898 to revive the idea of environmental cooperation both within parliament and among the various extraparliamentary organizations.43 Evans, as well as Bryce, Chubb, Hunter, Shaw-Lefevre, and Percival Birkett, solicitor of both the National Trust and the MPGA, were among those attending the meeting at Westminster on 23 June 1898 (ABW, 9 [1903], 59; Fedden, p. 171; MPGA, Report, 1917, p. 7). There it was decided to create a Parliamentary Amenities Committee to function "somewhat after the model adopted for the promotion of other special interests" by bringing together for coordinated action MPs inter- ested in "the protection of rural scenes. . . the provision and main- tenance of commons, open spaces, public parks and gardens . . . the preservation of buildings and places which are of peculiar interest by age, beauty or association . . . the conservation of wild animals and plants and generally for asserting the importance . . . of main- taining beauty, simplicity, dignity and interest in the aspect of out- of-door Britain" (ABW, 8 [1899], 6; NN, 9 [1898], 127).

WINTER 1983 215</page><page sequence="20">John Ranlett and, when necessary, to prod the Parliamentary Amenities Committee, the meeting also established an organization (never given a formal name) intended to serve as a framework for integration of the efforts of the Commons Preservation Society, the SPAB, Kryle, the MPGA, Selborne, SCAPA, and the National Trust. The CSAS entered the umbrella organization the next year. Chubb, secretary of the senior constituent organization, the Commons Preservation Society, became the coordinator (ABW, 8 [1899], 6; 9 [1903], 59-60). The two-tier organization does not appear to have been active. It was said, vaguely, that the Parliamentary Amenities Committee met on "various occasions" during 1899 and did "some useful work in con- nection with public and private bills," but Bryce, in his address to the Selborne Society's annual meeting in 1900, reported with unwar- ranted optimism that "one hopeful feature of the success of their campaign against the Nature-haters was, that they had not found it necessary during the past session to summon a meeting of the Par- liamentary Amenities Committee" (MPGA, Report, 1899, p. 19; NN, 11 [1900], io8). Probably the only lasting impact of the capstone attempt of 1898 was that it served in 1926 as a model recalled by Patrick Abercrombie in his Preservation of Rural England.44 Abercrombie's suggestion that the 1898 structure be reestablished led in 1926 to the formation of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England (CPRE) and to the revival in the 1930s of a Parliamentary Amenities group to be supported and prodded by the CPRE in the same way that Evans in 1898 had intended his Parliamentary Amenities Committee to interact with the unnamed coordinating organization (Sheail, pp. 70-71; SPAB, Report, 1929, p. 13; Fedden, p. 23). With the formation of the Parliamentary Amenities Committee and its parallel coordinating body, the attempt had been made, at the very end of the Victorian period, to create an organization interested in all aspects of the natural environment. This belated acknowledge- ment that all the various voluntary societies brought together in the new organization were working on associated aspects of the same problem - that their aims were, as Bryce was to say in 1900, "cognate" - points to one of the important questions which emerge from a study of the movement, the question of the movement's continued structural disunity (NN, 11 [1900], 107). Why did not the various voluntary environmental societies pool their resources to amalgamate into a 44 Patrick Abercrombie, The Preservation of Rural England: The Control of Develop- ment by Means of Rural Planning (Liverpool: The University Press of Liverpool, 1926), pp. 43-44, 47. VICTORIAN STUDIES 216</page><page sequence="21">LATE-VICTORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION single environmental structure? Would not such a step have eliminated duplication and wasted effort? Would it not have resulted in an ability to concentrate at any one time on the critical issues? Should it not have been clear that such a step was desirable? A number of explanations accounts for the continued fragmen- tation of the movement. There was the matter of organizational his- tory. The voluntary societies, as founded, had been focused on their own discrete concerns. There was delayed recognition that the issues first identified were in fact related, that they were components of a larger problem. Once the various associations had been founded, their own impetus was in each case toward a continued independent de- velopment, rather than a surrender of their uniqueness. Personalities inevitably played a part, especially during the lifespan of the founders. For example the apparent inability to work together on a single project - the formation of small gardens in disused burial grounds - led to the continued existence of two very personally oriented organizations, Lord Brabazon's Metropolitan Public Gardens Association and Octavia Hill's Kyrle Society. Just as there was no place for Lady Brabazon in Kyrle, so there was no place for Hill in the MPGA. George John Shaw- Lefevre, in point of longevity a pioneer in the movement, feared to see his efforts in commons preservation diluted by other, although asso- ciated, objectives and thus delayed the foundation of the National Trust (NN, 1 [1890], 103; Meath, Memories, pp. 220-224; Fedden, p.4). The experience of organizations with broadly defined objectives was not one which would encourage other similar projects. The Sel- borne League and the Plumage League had in fact amalgamated, but the resulting Selborne Society had objectives so diffuse that con- crete accomplishments were few. The Parliamentary Amenities Com- mittee itself, burdened with concerns across the whole spectrum, similarly accomplished little. By contrast, those groups which focused on narrowly defined objectives were much more successful in achieving their aims: in its first six years the MPGA was instrumental in opening forty-five gardens and eight playgrounds; the Keswick and District Footpaths Association, revived in 1885, fought in the courts for a favorable ruling on public access which it achieved in 1888; the first National Trust property was acquired even before the Trust was first put on a firm legal basis; and the foundation of the Commons Preser- vation Society in 1865 was followed only one year later by passage of the Metropolitan Commons Act of 1866 (MPGA, Report, 1888, p. 12; E. Rawnsley, pp. 71-72; Maurice, p. 533; Shaw-Lefevre, pp. 44-45). WINTER 1983 217</page><page sequence="22">John Ranlett Perhaps it was recalled that in the 183os and 184os the leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League had steadfastly resisted efforts to generalize their program by going beyond single-minded concentration on repeal. Any diffusion of effort would be fatal. The success of the League seemed to prove the thesis, and its model of narrowly focused attention to specifics was one which was followed by those environmental or- ganizations of the late-Victorian period which were successful. It may even be true that Bryce's comment in his 1900 address to the Selborne Society - that the existence of many societies with cognate aims creates the impression that there is vast weight behind the environmental movement - is an explanation for the disinclination of the various organizations to amalgamate (NN, 11 [1900], 107). One comprehensive organization is still only one organization and cannot create the impression of mass which may be suggested by many smaller groups working on related aspects of one issue. Organizational history, the force of conflicting personalities, practical experience, and public image all converge to explain the continuing existence of the environmental associations as separate entities. Another approach toward understanding the development of the late-Victorian environmental movement may begin by utilizing the scheme recently suggested by James Turner, which classifies the members of voluntary organizations in terms of their ultimate com- mitment to their cause. Turner differentiates between people whose commitment is total, who have as their first priority the changes they advocate and cannot happily contemplate a future without either those changes or a continuing struggle for them, and those who think the changes they advocate would make life a bit nicer, but who are fundamentally comfortable with society as it exists and see no reason to make too much noise about their campaign for improvement (J. Turner, pp. 40-44, 57-58). The majority of the individuals involved in the late-Victorian environmental movement obviously operated on this second, and much lower, level of commitment. Exceptions may include F. O. Morris, who broke his ties with the Selborne Society as it lost sight of. any overpowering concern with vivisection, and William Morris, whose socialistic commitment to fundamental change was not shared by many of his colleagues in the SPAB. But life in the society of the future as envisaged by Hunter, Bryce, Hill, Lubbock, Shaw- Lefevre, Evans, Richmond, Meath, and others did not differ funda- mentally from that with which they were familiar. They sought the changes they desired - more open spaces, cleaner air, less obnoxious billboards, or whatever- without any feeling that a revolution need VICTORIAN STUDIES 2l8</page><page sequence="23">LATE-VICTORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION be wrought or that extreme measures need be used. And they must have realized that they would not find the future intolerable if it should prove impossible to achieve the adjustments they sought. In the case of total commitment, failure brings an unbearable void. In the case of the lower level of commitment which marked most of the environmentalists, the results of failure could be contemplated with- out profound unease. This helps to explain why the environmental organizations were willing to operate relatively quietly. Mass meetings, great public pe- titions, and vast coordinated descents on parliament or on the govern- ment do not play a part in their history. The fact that the Commons Preservation Society functioned not from the plinth in Trafalgar Square but rather from the quiet confines of chambers in the Inner Temple demonstrates both its disinclination to seek mass support and grounds for a feeling that such support was unnecessary. Similarly the Kyrle Society's gathering in the Picture Gallery of Bridgewater House, St. James, shows the social position already enjoyed by its members, and if the Kensington Vestry Hall was a less distinguished site for a meeting, compensation was supplied by the presence of Prince Leopold as presiding officer. An organization which, like the National Trust, was invited to hold its first formal meeting in the ducal environs of Grosvenor House is clearly differentiated from a group which might feel the need to break down the railings of Hyde Park (Williams, p. i; The Times, 28 Jan. 1881, p. 10; 23 May 1903, p. 18; National Trust, Report, 30 April 1895, pp. 3-4). The environmen- talists, for the most part, were not required to attract the attention of the powerful and make political contacts. They already had that attention and those contacts. Canon Rawnsley's organization of a crowd of four hundred to destroy obstructions erected over the pathway to Skiddaw is not typical of the movement; when Lord Mount-Temple had gathered his tenants to remove barriers put up by his fellow aristocrat Lord Salisbury, Mount-Temple had at least sent a messenger round to Hatfield afterwards to explain (E. Rawnsley, p. 71; Williams, pp. 17-18). Much more typical of the movement is Robert Hunter, from his office in Lincoln's Inn Fields, persuading his fellow solicitors in the neighboring chambers to open the Fields to the public, or James Bryce, in the House of Commons, jocularly chiding landowners about their selfishness in excluding the occasional rambler from their property, or Sir John Lubbock settling with a parliamentary question the issue of the army's use of plumes stripped from breeding birds. Richardson Evans did not tear down the billboards; instead, he met WINTER 1983 219</page><page sequence="24">John Ranlett with the billboard owners and reached a gentlemanly compromise which the two sides then persuaded parliament to embody in law (D. Hunter, p. 13; The Times, 5 March 1892, p. 9; Doughty, pp. 115- 116; Sheldon, pp. 168-169). The organizations were not merely pressure groups. That is, their objectives were not limited to wresting concessions from par- liament or government, although in some instances they did pursue that normal pressure group tactic. The East Riding Association for the Protection of Sea Birds, founded by a friend of F. O. Morris, the Rev. H. F. Barnes-Lawrence, took some of the credit when parliament passed the Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869. The MPGA and the Kyrle Society joined forces to bring about enactment of the Disused Burial Grounds Act of 1884. The Commons Preservation Society in 1893 finally secured virtual repeal of the ancient Statute of Merton. SCAPA worked forthrightly toward the Advertisements Regulation Act which became law in 1907.45 But this is far from being the whole story. The Disused Burial Grounds Act was not in itself the objective of the MPGA and the Kyrle Society. It merely accomplished a little of the preliminary clearing away of the legal underbrush, after which the societies could go ahead on their own, without government assistance. The Commons Society focused its attention on the courts, rather than on parliament, and achieved its greatest success in Hunter's legal battles of the 186os and 187os. Thereafter, with the knowledge that the law was ultimately on its side, its members could push ahead through un- authorized barriers and across well-tended front lawns, as Hill, Hunter, and their colleagues in the Kent and Surrey Committee did in the 189os, maintaining public rights of access by the simple procedure of publicly and openly exercising those rights.46 Enforcement rather than new legislation was the original focus of the CSAS, which thought that the existing antismoke regulations would be observed only when the police and other local authorities became aware of a public de- mand. The CSAS used its own corps of inspectors to identify violations of the law and call them to the attention of the authorities. It soon branched out into the performance of research on smoke control and, 45 [Newton], 104-106; Morris, pp. 135, 144; David Elliston Allen, The Naturalist in Britain: A Social History (London: Allen Lane, 1976), p. 197; J.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 220</page><page sequence="25">LATE-VICTORIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION in launching its program for the scientific training of stokers, began to use a direct approach to the problem, far removed from ordinary pressure group activities.47 Many of the organizations paid little attention to either the enactment or the enforcement of law. The SPAB's power to prevent landowners from destroying ancient buildings, or allowing them to disintegrate, rested only minimally on statutory protection. More im- portant was the Society's "nuisance value to expose the ignorant and to intimidate the vulgar" by exploiting the owner's "fear of being laughed at, his dislike of being either a coward or a cad."48 But pressure, either statutory or personal, was less central to SPAB than was its effort to develop the technical expertise required "to stave off decay . . . to prop a perilous wall, or mend a leaky roof" (SPAB Manifesto, 1877, as quoted in Esher, p. 2). Kyrle, the MPGA, and, later, the National Trust were primarily concerned with the use of their own funds to achieve their own objectives. Kyrle and the MPGA used volunteers and their organizational treasuries to lay out and equip small urban open spaces. No pressure on parliament was required for this work. The National Trust was founded primarily to be a purchaser and owner of land. It did not expect much assistance from the political structure in saving places of natural beauty or historic interest. It used its own purse to save such sites itself. The National Trust's program was, writ large, Ruskin's expedition to repair the Hinksey road, characteristic, as Brian Harrison points out, of efforts of so many Victorian reformers in its renunciation of any design to substitute state action for voluntary effort (Harrison, "State Inter- vention," p. 307). "The existence of many societies with cognate aims" was Bryce's descriptive phrase at the 1900 annual meeting of the Selborne Society. "They were largely," he added, "made up of the same members," a contention which a study of the intertwining network of people and organizations fully confirms (NN, 11 [1900], 107). While his col- leagues in the fight to defend nature were more noteworthy for their social position and their willingness to be identified with the move- 47 Standard, 6 Dec. 1898; CSAS, Its Aims and Objectives (London: Coal Smoke Abate- ment Society, n.d.), pp. 1-3. 48 Viscount Esher, "The Early History of the Amenity Movement," typescript of lecture delivered 6 June 1957, p. 3, at SPAB, 55 Great Ormond St., London.

The effectiveness of the organizations may be questioned, but the fact of their existence means at the least that Victorians who en- countered in their path the deterioration of their natural environment did not pass by on the other side.
