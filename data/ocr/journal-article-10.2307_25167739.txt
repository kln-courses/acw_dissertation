Functional and Histological Changes in Rat Lung after Boron Neutron Capture Therapy. Radi?t. Res. 170, 60-69 (2008). The motivation for this work was an unexpected occurrence of lung side effects in two human subjects undergoing cranial boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The objectives were to determine experimentally the biological weighting factors in rat lung for the high-LET dose components for a retro spective assessment of the dose to human lung during cranial BNCT. Lung damage after whole-thorax irradiation was as sessed by serial measurement of breathing rate and evaluation of terminal lung histology. A positive response was defined as a breathing rate 20% above the control group mean and cat egorized as occurring either early (&lt;110 days) or late (&gt;110 days). The ED50 values derived from probit analyses of the early breathing rate dose-response data for X rays and neu trons were 11.4 ? 0.4 and 9.2 ? 0.6 Gy, respectively, and were similar for the other end points. The ED50 values for irradiation with neutrons plus /7-boronophenylalanine were 8.7 ? 1.0 and 6.7 ? 0.4 for the early and late breathing rate responses, respectively, and 7.0 ? 0.5 Gy for the histological response. The RBEs for thermal neutrons ranged between 2.9 ? 0.7 and 3.1 ? 1.2 for all end points. The weighting factors for the boron component of the dose differed significantly be tween the early (1.4 ? 0.3) and late (2.3 ? 0.3) breathing rate end points. A reassessment of doses in patients during cranial BNCT confirmed that the maximum weighted doses were well below the threshold for the onset of pneumonitis in healthy human lung. ? 2OO8 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a binary ap proach with the potential to deliver a higher radiation dose 1 Present address: Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Clinical Research/Oncology, 35 Cambridgepark Drive, CPD 3006, Cambridge, MA 02140. 2 Address for correspondence: Department of Nuclear Science and En gineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139; e-mail: coderre@mit.edu. to tumors while sparing normal tissues (1, 2). BNCT re quires the selective delivery of a boronated compound to the tumor, followed by irradiation of the tumor region, and invariably some surrounding normal tissues, with low-en ergy neutrons. The neutron capture reaction in 10B releases 2.79 MeV of energy, the majority of which is deposited within the boron-loaded cell due to the short ranges of the heavy charged particles released (a particles and 7Li ions, ranges of 7 and 4 |jim, respectively). Neutron beams gen erally contain both neutrons and y rays, both of broad en ergy spectra. The interactions of such beams with tissue during BNCT produce four principal dose components: 1. Dy, 7-ray dose, which is a combination of the dose from photons in the beam and the dose from prompt 7 rays released from the capture of thermal (E &lt; 0.5 eV) neu trons by hydrogen atoms in tissue, ^Ovy^H; 2. DF, fast neutron dose, caused by the recoil protons from fast neutron (a minor contaminant in most beams) col lisions with hydrogen atoms, ^(n^'VH; 3. DT, thermal neutron dose, which results primarily from the 580 keV protons ejected after capture of thermal neutrons by nitrogen atoms in tissue, 14N(n,p) 14C; 4. DB, boron dose, which is the dose from the heavy charged particles released by neutron capture reactions in boron, 10B(n,a)7Li. The first three dose components are due to the neutron beam itself and occur in all tissues in the irradiated field. Ideally, the boron dose component is restricted to the tumor, although in practice there are usually low levels of 10B in normal tissues. These dose components have different LET characteristics. To express the total BNCT dose in approx imately photon-equivalent units requires that each of the high-LET dose components be multiplied by experimental ly determined weighting factors to account for their in creased biological effectiveness (7, 3). The total weighted dose, Dw, is the sum of all the appropriately weighted dose components (Eq. 1) and is expressed in units denoted as 60</page><page sequence="2">RADIATION RESPONSE OF RAT LUNG TO BNCT 61 Gyw to distinguish it from unweighted, physical absorbed dose in Gy. Dw = wyDy + wFDF + wTDT + wBDB, (1) where wF, wT and wB are the experimentally determined weighting factors for the fast neutron, thermal neutron and boron dose components, respectively. A further weighting factor, wy, a low-dose-rate 7-ray dose reduction factor (DRF), is used for the 7-ray dose component, if applicable. In the period between 1994 and 2003, researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Harvard-Massa chusetts Institute of Technology (Harvard-MIT) carried out a series of clinical studies of BNCT involving patients with either glioblastoma, melanoma metastatic to the brain, or subcutaneous melanoma of the extremities (1, 4-8). The boronated amino acid, /7-boronophenylalanine (BPA), was used as the neutron capture agent in these clinical studies (3, 9). Two patients with brain tumors in the Harvard-MIT study developed a fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); one other patient developed acute pneumonitis but recovered after intensive supportive care (6). At the time, no measured weighting factors were available for the high LET dose components for BNCT in normal lung tissue, and the relative risk of pulmonary complications resulting from the collateral dose to the lung could not be assessed accu rately. Estimates of the weighted lung dose used RBE val ues for the high-LET component of the beam dose that had been derived in BNCT studies in other tissues. What was considered a conservative weighting factor for the boron dose component was used, but the possibility still existed that boron was accumulating in a critical subpopulation of cells within the lung, making the lung unusually sensitive to low-energy neutron exposure and the resulting boron dose component. The objectives of the present study were to experimen tally determine the weighting factors for all of the high LET dose components of BNCT in the normal rat lung using both functional and histological end points. These weighting factors were then applied in a reanalysis of the lung dose in subjects who underwent cranial BNCT to eval uate whether the weighted dose exceeded the threshold for pneumonitis in healthy human lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS Boron Analysis The boron concentration in liquid or solid tissue samples was deter mined using the prompt 7-ray neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) fa cility at the MIT reactor (70). This technique measures the prompt 7-ray emitted by the recoiling 7Li nucleus after neutron capture in 10B using a high-purity germanium detector. The system was calibrated using Na tional Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certified boric acid of natural isotopic abundance in an aqueous solution and has a detection limit of 0.25 |jLg 10B. All stated uncertainties on 10B measurements rep resent 1 standard deviation (SD). Dosimetry The vertical MOI 1 thermal neutron beam of the MIT Research Reactor was used for the neutron irradiations in these studies. This neutron beam has a high intensity, ?5.9 X 109 n/cm2 s, and a thermal (E &lt; 0.5 eV) neutron energy distribution with the contaminating fast neutron compo nent contributing less than 1% of the total absorbed dose (77). Details of the physical dosimetry measurements for these rat lung irradiations have been reported (72). Briefly, two rats (or rat-sized phantoms for dosimetry) were positioned in a shielding box composed of 6Li-enriched Li2C03 dis persed in polyethylene that included a 3-cm X 14-cm aperture in the lid to uniformly irradiate the lung region with thermal neutrons while shield ing the rest of the animal3 (72). Measurements of the thermal neutron flux as well as the photon and neutron absorbed dose rates were per formed using bare and cadmium covered gold foils and dual graphite and tissue-equivalent plastic-walled ionization chambers (V = 0.1 cm3), flushed with reagent grade C02 and tissue-equivalent gas, respectively, inside a cylindrical water-filled rat-sized phantom (72, 73). Monte Carlo simulations of the thermal neutron beam were validated by comparing computed dosimetry to measurements in the cylindrical phantoms. After normalizing to measurements, mean lung dose rates were computed using a detailed anatomical rat model that accounted for the lower density of lung tissue. Two sequential (anterior/posterior) fields were used to ad minister neutrons more uniformly throughout the entire lung volume. The mean total dose rate calculated in the lung with the neutron beam alone was 18.7 cGy/min (scaled to 5 MW, the full operating power of the reactor), which comprised 3.3 cGy/min of thermal neutron dose (the dose from fast neutrons was negligible) and 15.4 cGy/min of 7 rays (72). X irradiations were carried out using a single anterior field with a Philips RT250 unit, operating at 250 kV and 12 mA with 0.4 mm tin and 0.25 mm copper filtration. A 0.6-cm-thick lead plate with a 4-cm X 12 cm aperture was used as the beam delimiter for these lung irradiations. Absorbed dose rates were measured in the cylindrical phantom at a focus to-skin distance of 32.6 cm using the graphite-walled ionization chamber filled with air (72). The chamber was calibrated in terms of air kerma and an absorbed dose rate in lung of 1.0 Gy/min was determined using a mass energy absorption coefficient ratio between tissue and air of 1.10. Animal Irradiations All animal protocols were approved by the MIT Committee on Animal Care and were conducted according to the principles outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council. Male Fischer 344 rats approximately 12 weeks old (200-250 g body weight) at the time of irradiation were used for these studies. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xyla zine (10 mg/kg). Two rats were irradiated at a time, positioned side by side on the beam delimiter and affixed to the delimiter with 5-cm-wide clear adhesive tape. The lung region was positioned in the 3-cm beam aperture by aligning the bony protuberance of the T2 vertebra with the top of the irradiation aperture. Anterior/posterior opposed fields were used only for neutron irradiations, where the neutron beam shutter was closed and the animals were repositioned prior to the second irradiation field. Total irradiation times in the neutrons-only dose groups ranged from ap proximately 25 to 55 min. The time between the end of the first field and the beginning of the second field was ?10-15 min. Approximately 10 rats were irradiated at each planned dose in all irradiation groups. Additional rats were irradiated with a range of neutron beam doses after administration of the boron neutron capture agent 10B-BPA. Ap proximately 2.5 h prior to irradiation, BPA, solubilized (100 mg BPA/ ml) as the fructose complex (14), was administered as a single bolus i.p. injection at a dose of 900 mg BPA/kg body weight. Just prior to irradi 3 J. Liu, Optimization of parameters for rat lung irradiation with neu tron beams.

The blood l0B concentration as a function of time after large single i.p. injections of BPA has been shown to exhibit a broad maximum from 2-4 h after injection (75, 16) and was assumed to be constant during irradiation. In rats administered the same neutron beam fluence, animal-to-animal var iability in the concentration of boron in blood and tissues at the time of irradiation results in a range of absorbed doses in the lungs. Consequent ly, each rat that received neutron irradiation after BPA administration was sorted into a dose group based on the mean total dose to the lung, de termined from the 10B concentration measured in the individual blood sample taken immediately prior to irradiation. Total neutron beam irra diation times in the neutrons plus BPA groups ranged from approximately 12 to 30 min. Measurement of Breathing Rate The breathing rates of rats were measured using a whole-body pleth ysmography system at 1-2-week intervals for up to 26 weeks (180 days) after irradiation. The system was adapted from a commercially available instrument (Respiromax, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Four cylindrical Lucite chambers, 30 cm long and 7.6 cm in diameter, with plugs on each end, each with expandable gaskets to obtain an air-tight seal, were built for the system. A constant air flow of 110 ml/min was provided for the animals during the measurement through two ports on each chamber. A 3-min breathing signal was collected at a 200 Hz sam pling rate from a pressure transducer connected to each chamber. Up to four animals were monitored simultaneously. The signals were stored and processed off-line with customized software written in Matlab (The Math works, Natick, MA). The breathing signal analysis method employed noise suppression in the time domain and used the Fast Fourier Transform as well as a circular moving bootstrap to determine the breathing fre quency and its associated statistical uncertainty (77).4 Histology Scoring At 26 weeks after irradiation, or at earlier times if there was evidence of a marked increase in breathing rate with a loss of body weight and a hunched posture, the animals were killed humanely with a lethal i.p. dose of pentobarbital and the lung tissue was prepared for a semi-quantitative histological evaluation of radiation damage. Briefly, the lung was infused with 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde through a cannula tied into the opened trachea to fix the lung fully inflated within the chest cavity. The thorax of the animal was then removed and immersed for several days in 10% formaldehyde. After fixation, two slices of lung, each about 3 mm thick, were taken: one from the left lung, close to the main bronchus, and the other from the lower half of the superior lobe of the right lung. The lung section sample sites were standardized to ensure consistency among all rats and were considered as representative of the main lung volume. The two slices were dehydrated through graded alcohol solutions and embedded in paraffin. Two 4-|xm-thick sections of lung were cut from each paraffin block and stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or van Gieson's stain for elastic fibers. A scoring system similar to that reported previously (18, 19) was used for the histological evaluation. Three characteristic sets of lesions were examined, and their severity was scored separately: (1) mononuclear cell infiltrates present with inflammatory cells and macrophages, (2) large foamy cells with increased septal cellularity in the alveoli, and (3) path ological organizations (especially fibrosis). The percentage of the lung sections occupied by a specific lesion was used to assess the severity of this lesion. The details of the severity scale are given in Table 1. The sum of the three severity scores was used to represent the histological response. Dose-Response Analysis A mean breathing rate and its standard deviation were determined from the pooled data collected throughout the 180-day observation period from the sham-irradiated control group of eight animals. Irradiated animals with a breathing rate 20% (~3 SD) greater than the mean control value on any single measurement during the observation period were consid ered positive responders. The individual histology scores were trans formed into a binary response by choosing a severity index value at the approximate median of the observed histology severity index scores as the threshold for a response, i.e. &gt;3.5. These binary dose-response data were fitted using probit analysis and the ED50 values for a breathing rate or histology response were determined for each of the three irradiation groups: X rays, neutrons alone, and neutrons plus BPA. Both parallel (where the slopes of the probit curves are assumed to be the same for all radiation groups) and independent probit fits were used to analyze the data. Determination of Weighting Factors The ED50 values were used to determine the biological weighting fac tors for the thermal neutron beam and the high-LET dose components by equating the X-ray ED50 dose with the weighted dose for the test radiation at its ED50 value. The RBE of the neutron beam, wbeam, is defined as the ratio of the isoeffective X-ray and neutron beam ED50 values and is cal culated by solving Eq. 2. E&gt;x = wbeamDbeam. (2) Expressing the neutron beam ED50 value as the weighted sum of its two components yields a form (Eq. 3) that can be solved for the RBE of the thermal neutron component of the beam dose: Dx = wTDT + w7Dr (3) where wy is the DRF that accounts for the low 7-ray dose rate in the thermal neutron beam and DT and Dy are the thermal neutron and 7-ray components of the neutron beam ED50 values. Two points regarding Eq. (3) need clarification. First, because the MIT thermal neutron beam con tains no measurable fast neutrons, the high-LET component of the neu tron beam dose is attributed solely to thermal neutron interactions that result mainly in 580 keV protons from the 14N(n,p)14C reaction. When present, fast neutron contaminants interact mainly by elastic scattering and deposit dose to tissue through recoil protons that have a range of 4 J. L.

Since the secondary charged particles from the l4N(n,p)14C reaction and the fast neutron elastic scattering reaction are the same (protons) and are similar in energy, it is common clinical prac tice in the BNCT community to use the same RBE for both (3-8), i.e., to assume wT = wF. It is also not practical in animal experiments to separate the effects of fast and thermal neutrons. Second, the dose rate for the 7-ray component of the thermal neutron beam dose was 15.4 cGy/ min and a DRF as the 7-ray weighting factor (wy) is warranted to account for the reduced biological effects of photons delivered at dose rates less than ?1 Gy/min (20). Down et al. (21) previously determined the effect of dose rate on breathing rate in CBA mice that received thorax irradi ation with 60Co 7 rays, and all relevant experimental data for the effects of dose rate in the lung (for both breathing rate and lethality end points) were reviewed by Fu (20). Using the model reported by Down et al. (21) that was fitted to the experimentally derived ED50 values for impaired breathing rate in mice as a function of dose rate, an appropriate DRF of 0.86 was obtained for the present 7-ray dose component dose rate in rat lung. This value has been used as the weighting factor for the 7-ray component of the thermal neutron beam dose. For neutron irradiations in the presence of 10B, the spatial distribution of the high-LET dose component arising from ,0B(n,a)7Li reactions de pends on the microscopic distribution of the l0B compound. Thus the description of a biological weighting factor for this dose component ne cessitates the use of a more appropriate terminology than RBE, which by definition depends only on the quality (LET) of the test radiation. Ac cordingly, measured weighting factors for the 10B(n,a)7Li reaction dose component have been termed compound biological effectiveness (CBE) factors (7, 3). The CBE factor is based on comparison of isoeffective ED50 values for X rays and neutrons plus BPA. The ED50 value for neu trons plus BPA is expressed as the sum of two weighted components, the neutron beam dose and the l0B(n,a)7Li dose component (Eq. 4). E&gt;X = WbearrPbeam + ^ BD B. (4) Solving this equation for the CBE factor (wB) yields Eq. (5). It should be noted that applying a DRF of less than 1.0 to the 7-ray dose component of the neutron beam dose will significantly increase the ther mal neutron RBE (see Eq. 3) but will not alter the CBE factor for BPA (see Eq. 5). Error Analysis The probit-fitting software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC and The Mathworks, Natick, MA) provided an uncertainty on the estimated ED50 value that represents the statistical variation inherent in fitting the dose effect curve to the weighted data points. The magnitude of the probit fitting errors ranged from 1-12%. The estimated uncertainties in deter mining and administering the absorbed dose were 3% for X rays, 6% for the neutron beam, and 5% for the total neutron plus BPA dose (72). Mean lung doses computed with the Monte Carlo model had statistical uncer tainties that were negligible compared to those of the measurements used for benchmarking. The dose uncertainty and the fitting uncertainty were added in quadrature to yield a combined uncertainty (?SD) on the ED50 values. This uncertainty was propagated in the weighting factor (RBE or CBE) determinations that, when appropriate, included the estimated un certainties associated with boron quantification (5%) and with measuring the thermal neutron flux and photon dose components in the mixed ra diation field (each 7%). An uncertainty of 11% was assigned to the 7-ray DRF. This was chosen so that the 95% confidence interval encloses the original data (20, 21), interpolated to the 7-ray dose rate in the present study.

The ,0B concentrations measured in the lung and other critical tis sues are listed in Table 2. These are consistent with results published previously (75, 16). The mean blood boron concentration measured at the time of irradiation in all rats in the BPA plus neutrons group was 17.7 ? 3.4 juig/g (n = 90) with a range of 6.3-29.1 |jLg/g. In lung, the 10B component of the mean dose rate was 1.04 cGy/min per |xg 10B/g present in the tissue. This is in addition to the calculated mean lung dose rate of 18.7 cGy/ min from the neutron beam, comprised of 18% thermal neutron dose and 82% Y-ray dose. Thus, for a 10B concen tration in the lung of 17.7 |JLg/g, the mean total dose rate to the lung was 38.1 cGy/min, with 50% coming from the 10B dose component. The total absorbed dose in the lung was varied from approximately 4 to 12 Gy. The rats re ceiving neutrons plus BPA were sorted into dose groups based on the total absorbed doses in the lung as shown in Table 3. Breathing Rate Response The breathing rate of the control group (n = 8) was measured at 17 different times over 180 days. The mean breathing rate (?SD) of these control animals was 176 ? 13 breaths per minute. This 7.4% variability in the mean breathing rate of the control population represents mainly interanimal and intermeasurement variability since the mean uncertainty of individual breathing rate measurements over the entire data set (n = 4269) was only 2.4%. The number of animals in each group and the number showing a breathing rate response (&gt;20% above the control group mean) are summarized in Table 3. In most groups, a breath ing rate response initially occurred between 20-80 days after irradiation. The percentage responses as a function of time are shown for selected dose groups in Fig. 1.

Some of these responses became severe enough that the affected animals had to be euthanized. Animals that were euthanized ("Interim deaths" column, Table 3) were counted as responders at all subsequent times in the probit analyses. A response occurring &lt;110 days postirradiation was defined as an early response; a response occurring after 110 days was defined as a late response, although many animals had a persistent increase in breathing rate over much of the entire time frame. Only animals in the 12-Gy X-ray dose group showed a clearly defined biphasic reac tion with no responders observed at 95 days after irradia tion (Fig. 1). Animals in the neutrons plus BPA treatment groups dis played a distinctly different pattern of breathing rate re sponse than that described above: There was a greater in cidence of a late response than an early breathing rate re sponse. Only 2/10 and 5/20 of the rats in the groups re ceiving 7.5 Gy and 8.6 Gy neutrons plus BPA, respectively, showed a positive breathing rate response &lt;110 days after irradiation. However, nearly all (8/10 and 19/20) showed a late breathing rate response between 110 and 180 days after irradiation (Fig. lc, Table 3). At higher doses in the neu trons plus BPA groups there was a greater incidence of interim deaths (Table 3); these animals were scored as pos itive for both the early and later responses. Of those animals that survived to 180 days in the higher neutron plus BPA dose groups, all showed a late response. Weighting Factors Derived from the Breathing Rate Response The dose-response curves, fitted by probit analyses, for the incidence of a 20% increase in breathing rate relative to the control group mean after irradiation with X rays, neutrons only, and neutrons plus BPA are shown in Fig. 2. Dose-response curves are plotted for both the early (&lt;110 days; Fig. 2a) and late (&gt;110 days; Fig. 2b) increases in breathing rate. Both dose-response relationships are very steep and have very few data points between 0 and 100% response. In these cases, the use of parallel fitting aids in determining the ED50 but results in fitted curves that are less steep than the data points. The data for neutrons plus BPA (especially the early response) indicate a shallower slope relative to the data for the X rays and the thermal neutron beam alone. Independent probit fits showed no sta tistically significant differences in the ED50 values com pared to those from the parallel fitting. The ED50 values (?SD) for the parallel-fit dose-response relationships shown in Fig. 2 are summarized in Table 4 along with the derived weighting factors (RBEs and CBEs). Neither X rays nor thermal neutrons showed significant differences between the early and the late end points in either ED50 or RBE values. For neutrons plus BPA, however, the late re sponse ED50 was lower (P &lt; 0.0005) and the late response CBE factor was higher (P &lt; 0.01) than those for the cor responding early response. The CBE factors for the 10B dose component are relatively low, particularly the value</page><page sequence="6">RADIATION RESPONSE OF RAT LUNG TO BNCT 65 O 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 b?.-,-.-.-1-1-.-1-1-1--. .

This indicates that the lung is not unusually sensitive to the boron dose resulting from the 10B distribution and that the BPA is not sequestered in a sensitive subpopulation that would lead to an unexpectedly large biological effect. Weighting Factors Derived from the Histological Response The age-matched sham-irradiated control group (n = 8) showed a mean histology score of 0.75 (range: 0-2). The scores for rats in the high-dose groups ranged up to a max imum of about 7.

The dose-effect curves resulting from the probit analyses of these binary data are shown in Fig. 2c. The ED50 values for histological damage and the biological weighting factors derived from these values are in good agreement with those derived from the breathing rate data and are summarized in Table 4. DISCUSSION The CBE factors reported here indicate that the normal rat lung is not unusually sensitive to the 10B component of the BNCT dose when BPA is used as the boron delivery agent. The RBEs determined for the high-LET dose com ponent from thermal neutrons are comparable to values re ported in other tissues (1, 3, 22) and to values used clini cally in fast neutron radiotherapy (23). The possibility of using BNCT for the treatment of lung tumors or other tho racic malignancies warrants investigation now that the un derlying sensitivity of the normal lung has been defined experimentally. The isolated report of acute lung compli cations in brain tumor subjects in the Harvard-MIT BNCT clinical trial does not appear to be due solely to the collat eral BNCT dose in the lung. The Nature of the Breathing Rate Dose-Response Curves Radiation-induced lung damage is frequently described as occurring in two distinct phases: early inflammatory pneumonitis and late pulmonary fibrosis (24, 25). The time course and severity of both phases are a complicated func tion of dose, irradiated volume, dose rate and dose frac tionation schedule. At high doses, breathing rate may be significantly elevated over prolonged periods as a result of severe pneumonitis, leading to early lethality (26). At in termediate doses, distinct early and late phases in the im pairment of breathing may occur in some animals, while effects may persist in others. At low doses, late fibrosis can be observed with no evidence of early pneumonitis or func tional (breathing rate) changes (26). Changes in dose frac tionation can spare the early pneumonitis phase but not the later fibrosis phase (27). The absence of an early phase has also been reported after lung irradiation in mice or rats either with hyperfractionated dose delivery (28, 29) or by partial lung volume irradiation (26). Thus, although a strong consequentiality has been reported for the develop ment of late fibrosis after a positive early response (26), it remains unclear as to whether the two phases of lung dam age are causally linked or not. For the X-ray and neutrons-only groups, the dose to the lung was relatively uniform and the ED50s for early and late changes in breathing rate were comparable. However, in the neutrons plus BPA groups, a significant number of animals showed a late impairment in breathing rate without a pre ceding early response, and the dose-response curves for early and late responses were separated by ~2 Gy. The unique nature of the distribution of the 10B dose component could account for some of these differences. A non-uniform distribution of boron within the different cell populations within the lung (e.g., vascular endothelium, pneumocytes, lymphocytes) would produce a differential dose distribution directly proportional to the BPA biodistribution. It is pos sible that a non-uniform accumulation of 10B in the lung could differentially affect the expression of early and late responses and manifest as different ED50s. The microdistri bution of 10B from BPA in the lung was not studied and remains unknown. Microscopic techniques such as high resolution quantitative autoradiography (30) or secondary ion mass spectroscopy (31), which are capable of higher spatial resolution in the boron analysis than the gross tissue analysis provided by PGNAA, are required to provide in formation on the spatial distribution of BPA within the lung. Such studies would be highly recommended, partic ularly if BNCT is considered for lung tumors. Independent probit fits to the breathing rate data indicate a significantly (P &lt; 0.01) shallower slope for neutrons only and especially the curves for neutrons plus BPA compared to the X-ray dose-response curve. The different slopes could reflect a non-uniformity in the dose distribution with in the lung (perhaps due to a non-uniform distribution of BPA within the lung) or the different depth-dose profiles of the neutron and X-ray beams. They may also result from the non-uniform dose distribution that occurs at the micro scopic level due to the stochastic nature of the energy de position and the increased microdosimetric uncertainty as sociated with high-LET radiation delivered to small vol</page><page sequence="8">RADIATION RESPONSE OF RAT LUNG TO BNCT 67 urnes (32, 33). In the current study, the neutron beam dose comprises 18% high-LET radiation and the neutrons plus BPA dose comprises approximately 59% high-LET radia tion, for which the dose-response curves have progressive ly shallower slopes (Fig. 2a, b). The ARDS Cases in the Harvard-MIT Cranial BNCT Patients The major motivation for this study was to investigate whether the acute lung complications in two patients during the Harvard-MIT BNCT brain tumor clinical trial (6) could be attributed to high radiosensitivity of the lung to the col lateral dose. During BNCT of brain tumors, dose absorbed in the lungs can come from several sources: 7 rays origi nating in the head due to neutron capture in hydrogen, neu trons scattered from the treated volume that in turn produce both high- and low-LET dose components within the lung, a 10B dose component from the interaction of the scattered, thermalized neutrons with boron in the blood and the lung tissue, and radiation leakage (primarily fast neutrons) from the shielded beam line. After the ARDS incidences, a de tailed dosimetric study was performed in an Alderson RANDO anthropomorphic phantom.5 The measured ab sorbed dose rates at the lung apex, considered to be the region receiving the highest dose, were 0.66 cGy/min for 7 rays, 0.17 cGy/min for fast neutrons, 0.014 cGy/min for thermal neutrons, and 0.008 cGy/min |xg 10B per gram of tissue for the 10B dose. Conversion of these measured dose rates to a total weighted, photon-equivalent dose (Gy J re quired a series of assumptions because weighting factors for the different BNCT dose components in the lung had not been derived experimentally. An RBE of 3.2 was used for both the thermal neutron and the fast neutron dose com ponents that was based on measurements in other tissues (3, 22). The biological effects of the ,0B dose component in the lung were unknown, so a very conservative CBE factor of 4.0 was used. A 10B concentration of twice the concurrent blood level was used (measurements in this study showed a blood-to-lung ratio of 1:1). Because of the very low 7-ray dose rate, a DRF of 0.5 was used for the 7-ray dose component. Using these parameters, the esti mated lung apex dose in the two subjects with ARDS was ? 5.2 Gyw.5 The retrospective dosimetry indicated a steep dose fall-off in the lung as a function of distance from the head, with the dose to the mid lung region approximately a third of that to the apex. These estimates can be compared to the lung tolerance data from leukemia patients who re ceived single-dose, whole-lung irradiations with X rays as part of a total-body irradiation conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplant (34-36). In those studies, the pneumonitis threshold dose (TD) was 7 Gy, the TD5 was 8.2 Gy, and the TD50 was 9.3 Gy. 5 M. R. Palmer, Measurements and estimates of dose to the lungs dur ing cranial BNCT with the MIT M67 beam. Technical Report, Harvard/ MIT BNCT Program, September 1999. The weighted dose to the lung apex for the ARDS cases was recalculated using the results from the present study (I0B CBE factor for lung acute response = 1.4; RBE of the neutron dose component = 3.0), and assuming that the 10B concentration in the lung is the same as the mean 10B con centration in the blood (?15 jig 10B/g) and using a -y-ray DRF of 0.5, which is conservatively high for a dose rate as low as 0.66 cGy/min. Applying these parameters yields a maximum lung apex dose of 4.0 Gy^ for these two pa tients, which is lower that the 5.2 Gy^ estimated in the original report.5 The RBE for fast neutrons in the lung dur ing clinical irradiations was not measured in the present study. However, the effects of fast neutrons are relatively well studied. Clinical RBE values used for fast neutrons are in the range of 3.0 to 3.5 (23), while experimental RBEs for fast neutrons are in the range of 2-5 (37). These values serve to validate the RBE values used to estimate the weighted lung doses in the ARDS patients: 3.2 in the orig inal report5 and 3.0 in the present study. Based on these estimates of the absorbed dose to the apex of the lung, it is concluded that radiation damage from the collateral dose during cranial BNCT was insufficient to cause ARDS in healthy lung. Several additional factors sup port this conclusion: The pneumonitis threshold dose for partial-lung irradiations is considerably higher than that for whole-lung irradiations (26)', the clinical observations in the ARDS patients indicated that the initial pattern of pul monary infiltrate was diffuse and not restricted to the high dose apical region (f5); lung complications were not ob served in other subjects who received higher brain doses in the same Harvard-MIT BNCT clinical trial (6). It is pos sible that the dose in the lung interacted with some un known underlying sensitivity in these patients, perhaps re lated to their medications or the treatments they had already received. Inflammatory lung complications such as ARDS have not been reported by other groups conducting brain tumor BNCT irradiations. Potential Use of BNCT for Lung or Thoracic Tumors The data reported here on the sensitivity of the normal lung to the mixed-field irradiations produced during BNCT raise the possibility of using BNCT for the treatment of lung tumors or thoracic tumors. Indeed, based on our pre liminary report of these radiobiology studies of BNCT in rat lung (72), where only the CBE factor for the early ef fects of BPA was estimated, investigators in Japan have carried out Monte Carlo simulations of lung BNCT (38) and have begun experimental studies in a murine model of malignant pleural mesothelioma (39). To be conservative, it is advisable to use the higher CBE factor for the late effects of BPA of 2.3 for any possible clinical applications. BNCT could provide some interesting advantages over conventional radiotherapy in the treatment of lung tumors. With photons, the current state of the art in lung tumor treatment is limited by the movement of the tumor due to</page><page sequence="9">68 KIGER ET AL. the patient's breathing; internal organ motion produces a significant problem in the accuracy of tumor dose delivery and increases the volume of normal tissue that must be included within the treatment volume. Respiratory gating techniques can be applied by monitoring a surrogate for tumor motion with external (40, 41) or internal (42) mark ers. However, the trajectory of tumor position, as influenced by internal organ movement, is hard to predict or requires the implantation of internal markers (43). BNCT, in con trast, is a biochemically targeted therapy that can selective ly deliver a higher dose to boron-loaded tumor cells. The selectivity of the dose delivery is dependent on the boron localization within the tumor, not on precise geometric tar geting of the tumor with the neutron beams. Thus move ment of a lung tumor during treatment with BNCT of the lung region would be largely irrelevant. Epithermal neu trons have been used in the treatment of brain tumors, pro viding adequate neutron fluence to the center of the head. Epithermal neutrons would also penetrate the chest and lung region, given the lower mean density of lung tissue due to the air in the lung. The potential effectiveness of BNCT for lung tumors depends primarily on the ability of the boron delivery agent to accumulate selectively in the lung tumor relative to the blood and the normal lung tissue. Given a lung tumor-to-normal tissue 10B concentration ratio in the range of 2-4, it should be possible to have thera peutic ratios exceeding 2.0. These potential advantages sug gest that the use of BNCT for the treatment of lung tumors warrants investigation.
