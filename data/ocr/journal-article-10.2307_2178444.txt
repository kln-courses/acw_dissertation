<plain_text><page sequence="1">MECHANISM AND VITALISM. i. The problem of Mechanism and Vitalism may be regarded as single, but it is certainly far from simple. Recent discussion has shown it to be the meeting-point of a veritable maze of questions, touching experimental facts on one side and logical principles on the other. What is meant by 'mechanism'?. What are the limits, if any, of a mechanistic explanation of natural phenomena? How many different types of theory sail under the common name of 'vitalism'? Do living beings in their structure, growth, behavior exhibit features incapable of being explained in physico-chemical terms? If so, must we refer them to a special vital force? What is the nature of this force? What is its mode of operation? Can any theory on this point be tested and verified by experiment? If not, is such a vital force anything more than a fiction, at least for a science which seeks to be strictly empirical? Yet, without such a factor, is there any way of accounting for the difference between the living and the non-living? What, again, is the relation of biology to physics and chemistry? Is it a department of these latter sciences, or is it autonomous, with a field of facts and with char- acteristic concepts of its own? Suppose we decide for its auto- nomy, how does this affect the ideal of a unified theory of nature? Does this ideal commit us to seeking the explanation of all facts in terms of the smallest possible number of concepts? And should these concepts be taken exclusively from the physical sciences? These and similar questions have been interwoven in the recent literature of our topic. They are obviously closely connected with one another, yet no less obviously a discussion of each of them on its merits requires an expertness in so many different fields of knowledge, that hardly any single thinker nowadays can hope to handle with equal competence all sides of the problem. The best results may be expected from the sympathetic coopera- 628</page><page sequence="2">MECHANISM AND VITALISM. 629 tion of scientists and philosophers. And if cooperation is spiced with a dash of controversy, so much the better. For controversy is the medium in which theories grow in precision and have their logical stability searchingly tested. Nor ought we to forget, on this occasion, that to the historical development of mechanism and vitalism philosophers and scientists have equally contributed. It is enough to recall, prior to the nineteenth century, such names as Aristotle, Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, in order to realize that our topic has been one of the chief meeting-points of experimental research on the one side and philosophical speculation on the other. It is no mere acci- dent that Hans Driesch, in thinking out his vitalistic theory, found himself driven into fundamental problems of logic, and that the advocate of a mechanistic theory, on his side, is much more of a 'speculative' philosopher than he is himself aware of. We may thus take it as a happy omen that scientists and philoso- phers have been found willing to cooperate in our present dis- cussion. 2. The thesis which I shall try to support, and the bearing of which on some of the problems above enumerated I shall try to draw out in the following sections, may be summed up in the formula: Not mechanism or vitalism, but mechanism and teleology. The 'universe of discourse' of our discussion is best described, in Henderson's happy phrase, as "The Order of Nature"; and biology is our best door of entry into it. For biology can hardly avoid the larger issues of context which are suggested by the appearance of living beings in nature, of or- ganisms built upon and growing out of the inorganic. However much the worker in biology may seek to limit himself to the phenomena of life as such, to the problems of structure, growth, behavior, without troubling himself about the larger questions of the origin and status of life in the system of nature as a whole, still even the most superficial acquaintance with biological literature shows that such isolation is largely artificial, and always on the point of breaking down under the pressure of the desire for fuller knowledge. It breaks down, first of all, because, whilst physicist and chemist can ignore the phenomena of life, the</page><page sequence="3">630 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. biologist cannot ignore the phenomena of physics and chemistry. The living beings which he studies, whether single cells or multi- cellular organisms, are far too obviously physico-chemical systems. Once the breach has thus been made, the whole tide of wider issues sweeps in. Beginning with the difference between the living and the non-living, there comes next into view the problem of the way in which the phenomena of life are conditioned by their occurrence in bodies, i. e., in physico-chemical systems, and, again, by an environment, partly itself composed of living things, partly non-living. And once this point has been reached, the "order of nature" confronts us as the context within which the other questions must find their answers. Our 'Basis of Reference,' however it may be criticized in detail, seeks at least to give a summary impression of this order of nature, which is both an order of objective phenomena and a corresponding order of the sciences which give us the truth about these phenomena. It seeks to do justice, also, to the continuity of nature on the one side, and, on the other side, to the broad qualitative differences which we find within it, and which appear to demand an ascend- ing, or, at least, a cumulative arrangement. Within this universe of discourse, then, of biology expanded into the problem of the order of nature, the formula "not mech- anism or vitalism, but mechanism and teleology" is to be inter- preted. It means that we ought to replace the disjunction of mechanism and vitalism as mutually exclusive alternatives by the conjunction of mechanism and teleology. It demands that these concepts be treated as cumulative in the order of nature, and, therefore, teleology as logically dominant over mechanism in biology. So far as I can judge, the arguments against vitalism are decisive, if by 'vitalism' we mean the theory that in all the things called 'living' there is present some non-mechanical, non-spatial, semi-psychical force or factor-whether biotic energy, or entelechy, or elan vital-which yet has the power to interfere by way of regulation or control with the physico- chemical processes in the body; which can suspend the second law of thermodynamics; which can select for realization one of the physically open possibilities; which can create novelties, not</page><page sequence="4">No. 6.] MECHANISM AND VITALISM. 631 only unpredictable in advance but inexplicable after they have occurred. Vitalism in this sense I do not want to save, and this is the sort of vitalism between which and mechanism the choice for biology is usually said to lie. But whilst it is part of my thesis to reject vitalism on its merits, it is also part of it to reject the whole disjunction of vitalism and mechanism, acceptance of which would commit us to the affirmation of mechanism by the denial of vitalism. It is here that the second half of my thesis, "mechanism and teleology," comes into play. This is intended to give full scope to mechanistic theory to carry us as far as it can, but it is also intended to maintain that there is a sound sense in which it is true to say that the phenomena of life cannot be explained, or, better, formulated, in physico-chemical terms. Or, to put the positive side of the contention, teleological terms are required, not as substitutes for physico-chemical terms, but as fixing what I call the 'dominant' character of life-processes to which their physico-chemical aspect is subsidiary. The relation is easier to illustrate than to put into words. We find it, so it seems to me, wherever in nature there appears a new stratum or level, a new type of quality, or of structure. In the theory of colors, e. g., or of sounds, the 'dominant' concepts are derived from an analysis of colors and sounds themselves- colors as such, or as actually seen, sounds as such, or as actually heard-and it is only the ordering of these data in terms drawn from their own nature that gives relevance to the subsequent correlation of color-differences or sound-differences with dif- ference in the rate of vibration of some elastic medium. So, again, the dominant concepts of chemistry are patently derived from a study of the properties and states of elements and compounds in their relations to one another under varying conditions of temperature, presence of catalytic agents, etc. And it is not as a substitute for, but as a supplement, that we seek to correlate these facts and their laws with facts and laws of the physical structure and relations of atoms or whatever the ultimate constituents of matter may be. So with the phenomena of life. The dominant concepts required for an adequate theory of them are, on the view here maintained, teleological, but this</page><page sequence="5">632 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. involves no denial of their physico-chemical aspect, or of the importance of discovering the physico-chemical arrangements and processes on which teleological characters and relationships are built. To forestall misapprehension, however, I ought to say at once that, when I speak of teleological concepts, I do not mean a design, or plan, or purpose, or desire consciously enter- tained by any mind, be it of God, of man, of animal, or of plant. We need teleological concepts freed of these implications; con- cepts so general that conscious designs or desires are but a special type falling under them. The way seems to me opened here by the concept of value, the introduction of which permits us to read relations of cause and effect as also relations of means to ends. The one reading belongs to mechanism, the other to teleology. The two readings do not exclude each other but are compatible, and, where the teleological reading is possible at all, cumulative. Life requires both readings, but the teleological reading must be dominant. This is my thesis. 3. One of the corollaries of this thesis is the 'autonomy of life,' or to put the same point from a different side, the autonomy of biology. Now, in one sense this is, of course, a truism, which no one, when the point is put up to him, seriously wants to deny, and to insist upon which, therefore, may seem a work of super- erogation. Thus a convinced anti-vitalist, like Claude Bernard, is found writing: "Je serais d'accord avec les vitalistes s'ils voulaient simplement reconnaitre que les 6tres vivants presentent des phenomenes qui ne se retrouvent pas dans la nature brute, et qui, par consequent, leur sont speciaux. J'admets en effect que les manifestations vitales ne sauraient etre elucidees par les seuls phenomenes physico-chimiques connu dans la matiere brute . . . La biologie doit prendre aux sciences physico-chimiques la methode experi- mentale, mais garder ses phenomenes speciaux et ses lois propres."' The same autonomy obviously can, and ought to, be claimed 1 Introduction ia litude de la Medicine Expirimentale (i865), p. ii8. For a similar statement, see H. S. Jennings, Am. Journal of Psychology, I9I0, pp. 349- 370. For A. 0.

So much seems to me rightly implied in our 'Basis of Reference.' All the differences which experience reveals in the world are, in this sense, unique, specific, sui generis. Why, then, is it worth while insisting on such a truism? Because there is a noticeable tendency in many quarters to deny it, in effect, by the way in which the ideal of a 'unified' theory of nature is interpreted. This interpretation constantly takes the form of claiming to 'reduce' one type of phenomena to another, of treating one as nothing but another. Life, e. g., we find it said, is 'merely' a particular kind of physico-chemical process. Interpreted as a denial of vital force or entelechy, the statement is harmless enough. But it is harmful, or at least dangerous, in so far as the unique and distinctive character of life-processes is left completely unspecified and undetermined in this sweeping assimilation of them to physico-chemical processes in general. If we ask, What particular kind of physico-chemical process? it becomes clear at once that physico-chemical terms are not sufficiently specific and relevant for the answer required. In view of this situation it is of the utmost importance to insist that the attempt to eliminate differences, to break down boundaries, to unify by the 'nothing but' device, makes, not for orderly, but for dis- orderly thinking and does a disservice to science. The phe- nomena of life require to be dealt with first and foremost in their own teleological terms, and this not as a mere convenience of provisional 'description,' but as a necessity of adequate 'expla- nation,' or, better, of understanding. The principle of the autonomy of life, then, means the right to use in biology teleological concepts. That biologists con- stantly do use such concepts, is too familiar a fact to require illustration. Some frankly confess that they cannot help using them. Others are apologetic about them, as if they were a tem- porary makeshift pending the formulation of an 'explanation' in physico-chemical terms. The thesis here maintained is that the use of teleological terms is not a symptom of relative ignor- ance. It is not a sign of the inferiority of biology to physics and chemistry. The principle of the autonomy of life should be for</page><page sequence="7">634 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. biologists a charter of emancipation from the false fashion which leads some thus to depreciate their science. It should be a watchword reminding them to have the courage of their practice, and to insist on their right to use the language demanded by the facts with which they deal. That those who are really consistent in eliminating all teleological concepts from their thought and from their language-and this is patently the ideal which some 'mechanists' strive to realize are compelled to misconceive and misdescribe the facts, can, I think, be shown. As an example of the kind of argument which brings this point home to one, I would like to refer to the criticism in E. B. Holt's Freudian Wish,' of the biologists who, in their anxiety not to compromise themselves with animal souls, analyze, e. g., a bee's behavior into successive responses to visual, auditory, olfactory, etc., stimuli, and over it all lose sight of the bee and of the dominant fact that "the bee is carrying honey to its home." It is notice- able that the analysis of Bethe's which Holt here criticizes is itself still far removed from using strictly physico-chemical terms. Suppose, then, we push the issue back to the point to which a convinced mechanist must want to push it. Is not, let us ask, the bee's flight a case of the motion of a material body, and must it not as such conform to the laws which physics has formulated for matter in motion? Of course it is, and we may readily grant that, even though the flight of a bee, or the antics of a monkey in his cage, or the behavior of any other living thing have not yet been formulated in terms of mechanism, yet 'in theory' this can be done. The reason why it has not at present been done lies in the exceeding complexity of the phenomena, not in any inapplic- ability of the laws of matter in motion owing to their being sus- pended, or interfered with, by some vital force. The important point is: supposing it were done, would it be relevant? Would it really explain, i. e., give us a fuller insight into, what the bee is doing and why, than the account in teleological terms that it is laying by honey in its home? The moral of these considerations is that biology not only does, but may, not only may, but must, 1 P. 77. 2 See A. 0. Lovejoy, Unity of Science, 1. c., p. i6.</page><page sequence="8">No. 6.] MECHANISM AND VITALISM. 635 use teleological concepts, and use them, moreover, as logically dom- inant over all other concepts which for subsidiary use it may bor- row from other sciences. That all living beings, or, better, living bodies, are physico-chemical systems is here conceded and, indeed, insisted upon as much as the most whole-hearted mechanist can desire. But what I would also insist upon is that when we study living beings exclusively from the physico-chemical point of view, their character as living does not come within our field of study at all. From that point of view the difference between living and non-living is simply irrelevant. So far from being explained, it is rather ignored. It is not part of the physicist's or chemist's universe of discourse. Witness the transformation of the mean- ing of 'organic' in the chemist's language. The term there has lost the exclusive reference to the living which it retains in the biologist's mouth, and applies for the chemist to all carbon- compounds whatsoever, regardless of whether they are found or produced in the living or in the non-living. This, surely, is instructive. And the moral of it is that the biologist who knows his business will not try to 'reduce' himself to a species of chemist. Indeed, it is only on condition of his keeping his teleological categories dominant, that the investigation of the chemistry of vital processes becomes for him relevant and significant. He must first recognize a living thing or a living process as such, before the study of its chemical side or basis becomes impor- tant for him as throwing further light on his topic. In short, if our topic is carbon-compounds, life and the concepts it involves are irrelevant to us. But if our topic is life, then the laws of carbon-compounds, so far as these occur in vital structures and processes, are relevant, not because they reveal to us, as it is sometimes said, the 'secret' of life, but because a knowledge of the chemical processes involved in life (or, put differently, of the chemical bases or conditions of life) is part, but not the whole, of an adequate knowledge of life. Nor is biology in any way inferior to chemistry and physics, because it uses them ('depends' upon them, as it is sometimes ambiguously expressed), so far as they are relevant for its purposes. Its cognitive interest is cen- tered, first and last, upon the study of living beings, their struc-</page><page sequence="9">636 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. ture, their growth, their behavior. Their characteristic nature as living clamors for recognition in specific concepts. This is the situation to which the vitalist has the merit of calling attention, though he misinterprets it when he invokes entelechies or what not. This, again, is the situation which gives rise to the familiar assertion that 'no physico-chemical explanation of life is possible.' Such an explanation is impossible, not because of the operation of a vital force, but because, however detailed and complete in itself, it would neccessarily fail to touch the specific character of vital phenomena. To repeat: the principle of the autonomy of life, as here interpreted, means, not vitalism, but teleology- and teleology as compatible with, but logically dominant over, mechanism in biology. 4. This thesis may be challenged on the ground that it con- flicts with the aspiration of science to achieve such an organiza- tion of knowledge as shall enable it to deduce vital phenomena from physico-chemical phenomena. Very commonly in recent literature this ability to deduce is identified with an ability to predict, and neither is held to be possible except on the basis of a mechanistic theory of nature. In fact, the reduction of organic processes to inorganic processes is, according to this view, undertaken chiefly in the hope that it will enable us from purely physico-chemical data to deduce, i. e., to predict, vital phenomena, say the behavior of an animal in a definite situation. Thus Wilhelm Roux, in his Entwickelungsmechanik, formulates the mechanistic programme in the words, "Das organische Geschehen auf anorganische Wirkungsweisen zuriickzufiihren, es in soiche Wirkungsweisen zu zerlegen, zu analysieren." So keen a student of mechanistic and vitalistic theories as A.O. Lovejoy expands this formula as follows: "In what would a Zurfickffihrung of biology to chemistry or physics consist? It would consist in showing that a given organic process A can be subsumed under and deduced from a given generalization B of the more "funda- mental science."' In another paper this is further expanded as follows: " What the partisans of the doctrine of organic autonomy deny is that you conceivably ever can, from a study of the laws I Science, N. S., Vol. XXXIII, No. 85I, p. 6ii.</page><page sequence="10">No. 6.] MECHANISM AND VITALISM. 637 of motion of inorganic particles, arrive at a law from which you can predict how any living body will behave, even if you know the number, size, arrangement and composition of the particles composing that body."' Before passing to the particular issue of the predictability of organic phenomena, it may be as well to say something about prediction in general, to which, so it seems to me, an altogether exaggerated importance is assigned in modern theories of the function of science. Claude Bernard had a sounder view. "Toute la philosophic naturelle," he writes, "se resume en cela: Connattre la loi des phe'nomenes. Tout le problem experimental se r6duit a ceci: Pre'voir et diriger les phenomenes."'2 This dis- tinction is surely well taken. It is a valuable corrective of the fashionable view which makes prediction the main interest and business of science, and treats the discovery of laws as nothing more than a means to prediction. Indeed, I would go even further here than Claude Bernard, and regard prediction, not as a co-ordinate aim of science but as incidental to the experi- mental discovery of laws (in the process of verifying hypotheses) and as dominant only in the practical application of scientific knowledge in industry. From this point of view it is a mistake when the typical formula for a scientific law:-If A, then B, is read off as essentially a prediction:-If A happens, then B will happen; or, If you do A, then you will get B. Fundamentally, a law is a statement of a functional correlation between variables. 'If A, then B' means 'A implies B,' and there is no exclusive or essential reference in this formula to the anticipation of future events. It would, moreover, be wholly false to restrict science to a preoccupation with the future. Science is as much interested in the past as in the future, and its problems as often take the form of discovering the causes of given effects, as of predicting the effects of given causes. And, lastly, the treatment of an implication as a prediction is false, not only to the character of an implication, but also to the character of a prediction. Predic- tion, in the proper sense, is not hypothetical, but categorical. 1 Science, N. S., Vol. XXXIV, No. 864, p. 78. Lovejoy's italics. 2 Introduction a litude de la Medicine Expgrimentale, p. i0o.</page><page sequence="11">638 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. You do not predict so long as you merely say, If A, then B. But you do predict when you say, Here is an A, and in virtue of the law, If A, then B, I infer that there will be a B. A law, in short, is not a prediction, but may make a prediction possible when applied to a particular case, or to put it differently, when a definite value is given for one of the correlated variables. And even then the correlation must be of the kind which involves temporal sequence or order. Prediction, then, is by no means identical with deduction in general. It is a special case of deduction, possible only under special conditions. Moreover, it owes its prominence in the discussion of mechanism and vitalism to the fact that the relation of biology to physics and chemistry, or of organic to inorganic processes, is usually conceived, not merely as one of reduction, i. e., of subsumption of particular under general, but as an evolutionary and, therefore, temporal sequence. In this context we get the problem of the origin of life, in the form whether from physico-chemical data alone a Laplacean calculator could have deduced, i. e., predicted, the future appearance upon this earth of living beings. Or, more narrowly, could such a calculator, given an exhaustive knowledge of the particles and forces in- volved in the present position of my body in its environment, predict my next movement?' Let me make the question even more precise by restricting it to the law of falling bodies, and giving it the form of an imaginary experiment. Compare the fall, through the same distance of space and under the same atmospheric conditions, of two bodies which differ only in that the one is lifeless, the other living, whilst they are alike in weight, shape, surface-texture, and any other factors which affect the rate of fall. Do you, as physicist, expect to find any difference in the rate at which the falling body in each case traverses the distance to the ground? If you find no difference in this respect, is the difference between being 1 I agree whole-heartedly with the remarks of H. S. Jennings concerning predict- ability in his paper " Life and Matter," originally written for the fifth International Congress of Philosophy which, owing to the war, was never held.

II.</page><page sequence="12">No. 6.] MECHANISM AND VITALISM. 639 lifeless and alive relevant to you, as a physicist, at all? It will not be part of the data which make the falling body a 'case' of your laws. Hence your laws are indifferent, or neutral, to that difference. They hold equally in either case. A living cat does not infringe or violate them. It does not fall slower or faster than a dead one. Yet there is a difference, as we all know, not in the rate of fall, but in the turnings by which the live cat lands on its feet and breaks the fall, escaping injury and death, whereas the impact of the dead cat involves contusions of the body and broken bones. The point of the argument, if there is anything in it, is simply this, that the physicist's data and laws abstract from certain differences, which consequently can neither be subsumed under his laws nor predicted from them alone.' The conclusion which I would draw is that considerations of this sort support my previous contention. The biologist is interested in the study of living things, and hence finds it con- venient to divide all things in nature into those which are living and those which are non-living.2 The inclusion in his field of 1 Mention of 'lifeless,' in the sense of 'dead,' bodies suggests a curious point, about the exact bearing of which I am neither clear myself, nor are, so far as I can find, my biological authorities. If we dichotomize bodies into living and non-living, organic and inorganic, where do we put the bodies which are dead in the sense of having lost their life, of having been alive and having died? Does an animal or a plant by dying pass straightway into the same class with bodies that are lifeless in the sense that neither life nor death can be predicated of them? In short, death seems to fit awkwardly into the tidy classification of organic and inorganic. The point has interesting ramifications. The biologist, in effect, ceases to be interested in an animal when it has died. It has ceased to 'behave' and to 'respond'; its organs have ceased to function; the phenomena of regulation, so important in the economy of life, no longer appear. Yet would a physiologist necessarily agree to draw the line there? I recall being shown as a student an elaborate and expensive apparatus in the Physiological Laboratory at Oxford, used for experiments upon eyes taken from dead frogs, the result being interpreted as bearing on the question whether black is a positive sensation. It seemed to me humorous, but mechanists may think the joke is on me.-If we look in another direction, we find in the economy of nature, that dead organisms play an immensely important part as food for organisms which are alive. Is not breathing almost the only exception to the rule that, above the level of plants, living things absorb inorganic substances only indirectly by inflicting death on other living things or living on things that have died? And to a large extent this is true even of plants. 2 It is perhaps not an unnecessary reminder, at least to those of us who are unfamiliar with biology, but familiar with the history of philosophical terms, that when biologists use 'animate' as a synonym of living or organic, and 'inanimate'</page><page sequence="13">640 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. study of some things, the exclusion from it of others, depend upon the presence or absence of the distinctive quality or char- acter which we call 'life,' and which is empirically observable and recognizable. The physicist and the chemist are not interested in this character, and its presence or absence is irrele- vant to them. Hence to them living bodies as much as lifeless bodies are physico-chemical systems. But the biologist's interest in life makes him interested also in the physico-chemical structures and processes without which life is not found in our world. Hence his point of view, in this respect, may be called synthetic or synoptic. In any case, if our universe is to be intel- lectually tidy and ordered, we need both points of view as cumu- lative and supplementary, viz., the point of view from which all bodies are physico-chemical systems, and the point of view from which some are living and others are not. There is, if we like to put it so, homogeneity and continuity from one point of view, heterogeneity and discontinuity from the other. But nothing is gained by ignoring one of these two sides. 5. But this, it may be said, is incompatible with the unity of science, which requires a determinism in homogeneous terms, such as can be supplied only by a mechanistic theory, i. e., a theory by which all qualitative differences are reduced to, and explained in, terms of one kind only, and these ultimately the terms of physics. The admission of non-mechanistic concepts would destroy the determinism which is essential to science in general and to experimentation in particular. The reply to this objection is, briefly, that my thesis not only does not involve the surrender of determinism, rightly inter- preted, but meets all the logical requirements of the situation. The main points may be summarized as follows. (a) In the first place, we ought to distinguish between determinism and mechanism. The determinism which is identical with 'reason' in science, and without which any 'rational' explanation of natural phenomena is rightly said to be impossible, requires merely that every such phenomenon shall be 'determined by' as a synonym of non-living or inorganic, they do not identify life with the presence of an anima or soul. They ring the changes on these terms simply to avoid monot- ony of style.</page><page sequence="14">No. 6.] MECHANISM AND VITALISM. 64I some other phenomenon, i. e., correlated with it according to a law. A mechanistic theory is but a special form of this general principle of determinism, deriving its specific character partly from the introduction of a temporal factor (cause preceding effect), but more characteristically from the exclusive use of " geometrical, kinematical, mechanical, and physico-chemical terms," as stated in the 'Basis of Reference.' (b) Every law is a statement of an implication between universals, or, in mathe- matical terminology, of a functional correlation between vari- ables. In the natural sciences which deal with existences in time and space, presented or presentable in the form of sense- data, all universals have cases, or instances, or applications; all variables have definite values. (c) But a unified theory of nature does not require the reduction of all universals to one kind, or the restriction of all variables to one type of values. We have laws correlating geometrical, physical, chemical phenomena among themselves in each group, as well as laws correlating phenomena of one group with those of another. There will then result a scheme, or an order, in which differences are pre- served, and not 'reduced,' and in which a unified theory is achieved by the correlation of different types or groups or levels of phenomena which follow also among themselves each its own characteristic laws. (d) We shall thus expect to find what, in- deed, we actually get in a large part of biological work, viz., a determinism in terms which are thoroughly teleological. Such a determinism will meet all the requirements of what H. S. Jennings pleads for under the names of "'experimental determinism " or " radically experimental analysis. " One might formulate the principle of determinism as 'every difference makes a differ- ence.' This is nothing but functional correlation expressed in other words. For, when two factors are correlated, a change in one must involve a corresponding change in the other-'cor- responding,' whether or no the variations on both sides are measurable and quantitatively determinable. In scientific observation the rule of method is, given an observed difference A to search for some other observable difference B, such that A is present where B is present, absent when B is absent, and varies</page><page sequence="15">642 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. concomitantly with the variations of B. This is the elementary ABC of induction. Experimentation applies the same prin- ciple by artificially introducing, removing, or varying B so as to study its correlation with A. As H. S. Jennings says-in com- plete accord with the teachings of logicians on this point-the whole " organization " of experience by " discovery of corres- pondence in diversities " depends on this principle.' (e) The only point of refinement which this paper may, perhaps, claim to add to the above account is the insistence on what I have ventured to call the 'logical dominance' of the characteristic concepts and laws of biology on the ground that biology deals with structures and processes which have, indeed, their physico- chemical aspect, but cannot be reduced to exclusively physico- chemical terms without sacrificing precisely what makes them distinctive. 6. It remains to say a few words in defence of teleology and of the language of 'purpose,' by ridding the latter term of certain associations, the presence of which makes it unwelcome to scien- tists, and which are not required by the facts. 'Purpose' is objectionable, because it suggests the activity of a scheming or designing intelligence where no evidence of such is found. To talk of purposes in nature at once gives rise to the suspicion that their admission is to be exploited, as in the old Argument from Design, in the interests of an anthropomorphic deity; that intelligible law is to be replaced by an unintelligible will. But our plea here is that the terms can be freed from these implications and made scientifically useful. A transition can be made from 'efficient' to 'final' causes by the simple reminder that a nexus of cause and effect can also be taken as a nexus of means and end, whenever the effect has value. A natural law, in the sense explained in the last section, neither demands nor forbids the introduction of the concept of value, and is, therefore, entirely compatible with' it, if the empirical facts should demand it. Some modern writers, indeed, would limit the application of the concept of value to whatever is desired. Things, they say, 1 Life and Matter, p. 6 et passim. Cf. also the general position outlined there on pp. IO-II.</page><page sequence="16">No. 6.] MECHANISM AND VITALISM. 643 become valuable, or acquire value, by being desired. But, again, it is not in this sense that the term 'value' is to be employed here. When biological science speaks of conditions as 'beneficial' or 'harmful' for the organism; when it calls some chemical sub- stances 'foods,' others 'waste-products'; when it speaks of the 'function' of an organ, or through the concept of 'organization' interprets the parts in the light of the whole; when, in dealing with 'growth,' 'behavior,' 'reproduction,' etc., it applies the concept of the maintenance or development of each characteristic type of living structure-its language is full of the kind of teleol- ogy which the term 'value,' or, if it be preferred, 'objective value,' is here intended to cover. Wherever, broadly speaking, the facts challenge us to say, not merely that B is the effect of A, but that B is the reason why, or that for the sake of which, A exists or occurs, there we have the immanent purposiveness of living things. To introduce here the analogy of human pur- poses, i. e., to suppose the existence of these structures, the occur- rence of these activities and functionings, to have been preceded by a desire for their existence or occurrence, or by a conscious design, plan, scheme, first thought out and then realized by the manipulation of means, would be misleading and irrelevant. No living thing begins by planning or desiring its own existence, its own form and function. No organism grows and lives ac- cording to a preconceived specification, building up its body like a builder working to a design, or like a tailor working to a pattern. 'No living thing' we said. And this covers not only plants and animals, but man. For, though we claim each to be 'master of his fate,' yet for all the planning that we do, for all the efforts that we make to guide ourselves and our world towards desired results, we tend vastly to overrate the part that desiring and scheming play in making us and our world what they are. Conscious choice, intelligent control, art, masks, but does not displace, the immanent and unconscious purposiveness which the lives of individuals and societies exhibit, and which is discernible even through their misfits and failures. When we ask what character in natural objects, or in nature as a whole, exhibits this immanent purposiveness, this 'design,'</page><page sequence="17">644 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVII. most clearly, the answer must surely be that it is organization not merely in the static sense of a systematic structure of dif- ferentiated parts, but in the dynamic sense of this organization at work and functioning as a whole, responding through its organs (which are very literally 'instruments') to its environment, adapting that environment to itself and itself to it. A purposive structure, in Kant's famous phrase, is one in which parts and whole are reciprocally means and ends. The subordination of the parts to the whole lies precisely in that delicate mutual adjustment of the parts which, in respect of their functioning, we call regulative, and which in form as well as in function yields the characteristic individuality-one might almost say, using the word in the artistic sense, 'the effect'-of each living thing. Aristotle went straight to the heart of the matter when he com- pared this organization of each living thing to the order of a commonwealth. "And the animal organisms must be conceived after the similitude of a well-governed commonwealth. When order is once established in it, there is no more need of a separate monarch to preside over each several task. The individuals each play their assigned part as it is ordered, and one thing follows another in its accustomed order. So in animals there is the same orderliness-nature taking the place of custom and each part naturally doing its work as nature has composed them."1 We have here clearly what in the language of modern biology is expressed as " the conception of the living thing as an autonomous unit in which every part is functionally related to every other and exists as the servant of the whole."2 And yet living beings are also constantly spoken of as 'living machines' and their organs as 'mechanisms' for doing this or that. Whence it is a short step to the demand for an exclusively 'mechanical' explanation. But a brief reflection on the concept of a machine will both account for the plausibility of this language and yet lend support to our view. It is surely a startling paradox that machines, which, as human tools for human ends, are more 1 Henderson has done a real service in reminding us of this passage in his Order of Nature, p. io. 2 Henderson, ibid., p. 2I. 'Functionally related' in this context bears, I take it, both the mathematical sense given to it in section (4) and the teleological sense of this section. The two senses correspond to cause-effect, means-end respectively.</page><page sequence="18">No. 6.] MECHANISM AND VITALISM. 645 patently purposive than anything else in the world, being arte- facts of human design, should have furnished by analogy the concepts which are used to shut out from the purview of science, not merely conscious design, but the immanent purposiveness exhibited in organization and regulation. Yet a machine is nothing if not organized, and frequently it is fitted with devices for regulating its own workings. It is, in fact, like an organism, a systematic structure of differentiated parts with differentiated functions. It was this uncanny likeness of machines to organ- isms which suggested Samuel Butler's brilliant fancy, in Erewhon, of a revolt of machines against man, their maker, the intelligence embodied in them making itself, as it were, independent. What is it that enables science to borrow from so purposeful and highly organized a thing as a machine the concepts for dealing with the non-purposive and inorganic? The answer would seem to be this. A machine, just because as a human tool it exists, not for its own sake, but for the sake of something other than itself, makes it easy to abstract from its purpose and to consider its organized structure as simply a system of particles and forces, undergoing transformations according to purely physical laws. A physicist, whom we will suppose ignorant of the purpose of a watch, might still be able to analyze it as a mechanism and to explain just why this intricate arrangement of toothed wheels and other devices, operated by a spring, must effect the rotation of two hands, each at its own uniform speed, but one twelve times as fast as the other. So far the mechanistic point of view, with its cause-effect principle, might carry him, nor need he know the end to which the whole arrangement is means. Now if it is easy to analyze a machine which has a purpose as if it had none, be- cause its purpose is 'external' to its own existence, it is even easier to ignore the immanent purposiveness of an organism, which is not obviously an instrument for anything. Thus, by a similar abstraction from their teleological character, organism and machine can be analyzed, as if neither exhibited any char- acters except those of which we take account when we study them as physico-chemical systems.
