The study of military units and camps continues to be one of the fastest developing areas in Roman his- tory. A notable contribution is the work at hand which synthesizes the results of eight years (1963-70) of ex- cavations conducted on the site of the Roman auxiliary camp located near the Transylvanian village of Buci- umi. Although occasional archaeological finds have been reported from Buciumi (known as Vairmez5i in older literature, cf. CIL III 842, 7645 and 8074,22 =</page><page sequence="2">1973] BOOK REVIEWS 463 1633,5), no systematic exploration of the site was undertaken before 1963. Important archaeological, numismatic, epigraphical and historical discoveries have resulted from the ex- cavations. The findings are here published in detailed catalogs supported by photographs, superb drawings, and a commentary documented with an exhaustive bibliography. With proper caution, the collaborators warn that their conclusions must, in many cases, re- main tentative until the entire site has been uncovered. Situated on a low hill north of Buciumi on the left bank of the upper Agrij River, the camp was a vital link in a chain of seven frontier camps, which together with numerous advanced watchtowers along the Mese? mountain ridge formed the northwestern limes of Da- cia Porolissensis. Two phases of construction were detected. A turf and timber camp, 150 x 128 m., was first erected on this site immediately after the conquest of the prov- ince in A.D. io6. Later it was rebuilt with stone and slightly enlarged (i67 x i34 m.). The date of the construction of the later camp is problematical. On the basis of architectural features, the authors suggest a date at the end of the 2nd century or beginning of the 3rd. As support they cite the arguments of the late Romanian scholar Michael Macrea to whom they dedicate their monograph. Macrea interpreted inscrip- tional and archaeological evidence as indicating a date in the reign of Caracalla for the construction in stone of frontier camps in Dacia. A much earlier date, however, seems possible to this reviewer. During Hadrian's reign stone fortifications were erected on several frontiers. In nearby Pannonia Inferior, for example, the Romans strengthened the frontier by constructing stone auxiliary camps (see Radn6ti and Bark6czi, "The Distribution of Troops in Pannonia Inferior," ActaArchAcSciHung I [1951] 224-226). And in Dacia itself, at Porolissum, the ful- crum of the Limes Porolissensis, a dilapidated amphi- theater was rebuilt, presumably in stone, in the year 157 (cf. CIL III 836). It seems unlikely that a theater in stone would have received building priority over a stone-walled camp, especially on a troublesome frontier like that of northwestern Dacia. The identity of the garrison is firmly established by inscriptions and brickstamps as a Cohors I Augusta and the Cohors II Nervia Brittonum Milliaria, which appears to have been transferred from Pannonia In- ferior to Buciumi shortly after 14. There the latter unit remained, perhaps until the province was aban- doned in 271. Apparently before 114 the camp was occupied by a Cohors I Augusta, which may be the same unit as the Cohors I Augusta Ituraeorum Sagit- tariorum, listed among the troops of Dacia Porolissen- sis on a number of military diplomas. Whether the two units ever occupied the camp simultaneously is unknown. From the barracks area of the camp come most of the artifacts found, an unusually wide variety includ- ing ceramics, weapons, armor, tools, ornaments, glass- ware, coins, statues and inscriptions. Seven Republican coins and 258 imperial issues, dat- ing from the reign of Tiberius to that of Philip the Arab, are reported. That the majority of these were minted in the reign of Trajan, between ioo and Iio, may be attributed to the stipendia and donatives paid to numerous soldiers serving in Dacia during and after the conquest. Among them three counterfeit coins lend further support to Macrea's suggestion that a clandes- tine mint, perhaps under official sanction, operated in the area. Judging from their exceptional condition, the Republican coins probably represent pieces from pre- Roman Dacian hoards that were recirculated after the conquest. Among the inscriptions discussed are thirteen previ- ously unpublished items, including three military di- plomas. Unfortunately, these are all extremely frag- mentary. Especially deplorable is the condition of the diploma issued between A.D. II9 and 138 to a soldier in Dacia Porolissensis. It might have contained a clue to the problem of dating the formation of Dacia Poro- lissensis (see my note "Some Governors of Dacia: A Rearrangement," CP 64 [1969] Io6). The presence of these diplomas at Buciumi suggests that it was not unusual for veterans to remain after their discharge in the province in which they had served. Their discovery in the camp itself may further suggest that the sons of veterans, who normally followed the careers of their fathers, kept these documents as proof of their Roman citizenship. Information about the religious life of the garrison is meager. One bronze and several terracotta figurines, of crude manufacture, may point to the existence of a cult of Venus. Other aspects of daily life, however, are attested in detail. Ornaments of dress, perfume bottles, and strigils reflect a concern for personal grooming; however, the location of the camp's bath re- mains unknown. Medical instruments reveal the pres- ence of army physicians, while numerous styluses and inscribed personal effects indicate widespread literacy. Interrelations between Roman soldiers and the in- digenous population are evident from the mixture of native and Roman pottery found throughout the camp, but information pertaining to the civilian set- tlement around the camp is lacking. Import pottery is also represented and includes terra sigillata, glazed ceramics, and anthropomorphic vases. Thus far no indications of violent destruction have been discovered within the camp. Evidence of burning was, however, detected at one point on the wall east of the porta principalis dextra, but no explanation is proposed. Professor Chirilt and his associates deserve our gratitude for making this important study available through German translation to a wider range of read- ers whose interest in Roman Dacia has been aroused in recent years by the multitude of excellent studies from Romanian scholars.
