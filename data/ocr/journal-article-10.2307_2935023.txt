<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRANSITION 45 ART AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS Dennis Duerden In 1907 in Picasso's 'Les Desmoiselles D'Avignon' the first forms directly derived from African art ap- peared in modern Western art. This was not the first time that forms derived from other societies had ap- peared in Western art. In fact the Greek classical forms which were idealised in painting and sculpture in the eighteenth century seem to have been revalued for rea- sons which were not so widely different from those which brought about the introduction of African art, a widespread discontent and malaise, about the nature of industrial society, and a return to 'a lost time' or Arcadia in which man was closer to divine inspiration. (Because classical forms were re-evaluated in this spirit in the eighteenth century, they had a somewhat different social and psychological background from their use during the Classical Renaissance). However the revival of an interest in Greek classical form in the eighteenth century did not involve an interest in an alien art and it was still impossible at that time for artists and art historians to appreciate an art which differed in essential features from their own. During the following century an extraordinary revolution took place which seemed to gather momentum the more widely and deeply felt were the effects of the industrial revolution. It was remark- able at first for the Pre-Raphaelites to have considered the quattrocento Italian painters as worthy of their attention. Perhaps the most important sign of the change however was the use of Japanese prints made by Van Gogh and Gauguin, and by the end of the 19th century Italian 'primitives', Japanese woodcuts, Oceanic wood carvings, Egyptian sculpture and wall- paintings, medieval Russian icons, and the art from several other parts of the world and previous ages were having a demonstrably strong influence. What had happened to African art? Why was it the last alien art to influence Europe and why did it have a catalytic effect in the revolution in European art immeasurably greater than any other? In 1905 Vlaminck, the fauviste painter in Paris saw some African carvings in a cafe which he carried away and showed to Picasso and Derain. The Dresden Ethnological Museum had already acquired some African figures and at about the same time these were regarded by the German expressionists of the group known as 'Die Brucke' as works of art and not as mere ethnological curiosities. However the consideration of African sculptures as works of art appears to date from the British punitive expedition to Benin in 1897. Large quantities of Benin bronzes were bought from the members of the expedition for the British Museum in London and for the Berlin Ethnographical Museum and were described in big, illustrated catalogues. An article by Ling Roth appeared in the Studio magazine in London in 1897 and was subsequently republished as a chapter in his book 'Great Benin'1 in 1902. Writing of a sistrum Ling Roth described it as ". . . an elegant piece of workmanship. The thoroughness of the details of execution is worthy of a Japanese".2 The importation of African carvings into Europe is reported as long ago as 1470 when the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, is reported to have bought some African carvings from a Portuguese sailor.3 The first great ethnological museum in Paris, the Trocadero, was established in 1869 and it is reported that Picasso and Matisse used to go there in the early years of this century without discerning that the African sculptures there had any artistic merit. Vlaminck claims that it was after their revelation to him in a cafe at Argenteuil on a hot summer's afternoon in 1905 that the French 27</page><page sequence="2">TRANSITION 45 painters hailed the African carvings as great works of art, but it seems improbable that the discovery was as apocalyptic as he wanted us to believe. After the first discernible forms derived from African sculpture appeared in European art in Picasso's painting 'Les Desmoiselles D'Avignon',4 for the next fifty years nearly every great European painter used African forms in his work at some time or another and their influence spread very quickly; (paintings by German and Russian painters exhibited in Bei in and Russia in 1909 and 1910 contained them). At the same time twentieth century Western artists formed large collections of African art and established special relationships with particular dealers; e.g. Picasso with Pierre Loeb. The early collectors of African works regarded them as curious trophies brought back from strange and remote places, as did the travellers who saw them in their own surroundings. Compare the Dutch sea-captain David van Nyendael's account of the Benin antiquities, in his letter to Bosman published in 1702 with Ling Roth's description, nearly two hundred years later. David van Nyendael wrote of being conducted through the Oba's palace at Benin. "A third gallery offers itself to view, differing from the former only in that the planks upon which it rests are human figures, but so wretchedly carved that it is hardly possible to distinguish whether they are most like men or beasts, notwithstanding which, my guides were able to distinguish them into merchants, soldiers, wild beasts, hunters, etc. Behind a white carpet we are also shown eleven men's heads cast in copper by much as good an artist as the former carver; and upon each of these is an elephant's tooth, these being some of the King's Gods." 5 This description of the Benin bronzes is very different from the one given by Ling Roth in his Studio Magazine article in 1897 when he wrote about a casket brought home by Dr F. N. Roth ... "the great vadiety of the objects exhibited without any overcrowding, the general grouping, the toned background, the real beauty of the major portion of the design, show that the artist was a man of commendable taste, not only judged as a Negro, but as a man of culture."6 The attitude of the Dutch sea-captain, David van Nyendael, then, was the attitude of the 17th and 18th century to the arts of other people generally. The expressed attitudes of painters and academicians showed that their minds were shut to every art which did not concern itself with a more or less exact imitation of an object. This rule not only applied to foreign art but to the art of their own culture of an earlier period. Lecturing on Cimabue's 'Madonna Rucellai' in his Royal Academy lectures in the 18th century, James Barry said --The very great deficiencies of this work of Cimabue might, perhaps, induce some to think that he could not possibly have availed himself of the ins- pection of nature when he painted it. But the imitations of early art are exactly like those of children; nothing is seen even in the spectacle before us, until it be in some measure otherwise previously known and sought for, and numberless observable differences between the eyes of ignorance and those of knowledge show how much the construction or extension of our sphere of vision depends upon other considerations than the simple retaining of our mere natural optics. The people, then, of those ages, only saw so much and admired it because they knew no more."7 Barry's view of the nature of good painting implies that objects are re- presented in a certain kind of way, as if they were projected onto a window pane, or on the frame of a camera-oscura. He makes a special choice of the kind of objects he would like to see represented-figures in classical poses and with classical features-but demands that they should be represented by the kind of images we receive directly onto our retina when looking through a small rectangular frame. This passage from Barry is in fact quoted by a modern art historian, who in order to make the history of art 'scientific' demands that we see it as the history of representation. Emist Gembrich writes in his book 'Art and Illusion', that "The central problem of the history of art is why re- presentation should have a history". 8 In order to give representation a history Gombrich makes amendments to the theory of an early twentieth century art critic, Roger Fry. He quotes Fry: "From our point of view the whole history of art may be summed up as the history of the gradual discovery of appearances. Primitive art starts, like that of children, with symbols of concepts. In a child's drawing of a face a circle symbolises the mask, two dots the eyes and two lines the nose and mouth. Gradually the symbolism approximates more and more to actual appearance, but the conceptual habits, necessary to life, make it very difficult, even for artists, to discover what things look like to an unbiased eye."9 Fry went on to describe the history of art as the gradual dis- carding of 'conceptual habits', a progression from neolithic times to the full exploration of atmospheric colours and three dimensional perspective by the French Impressionists. Gombrich thinks that there is a pro- gression in the history of art, but that the progression should be described somewhat differently. It should be described as a progression away from 'the schematic' rather than 'the conceptual', "there exists a natural pull towards the schematic which artists such as Giotto or Constable succeed in overcoming",10 and "Because of the gravitation towards the schematic, we have a right to speak of primitive modes of representation, modes, that is, which assert themselves unless they are deliberately counteracted." 1 1 Gombrich says he is reluctant to adopt an evolutionary theory, but that there is some truth in it, and what the truth according to Gombrich turns out to be is that the history of art is the gradual progress to the experience of an illusion of a view seen through a window-frame. Gombrich appears to agree that man sees differently at each stage of his history, but seems to think that the seeing of William Constable, the English painter, was a more accurate way of seeing and therefore of representing what was seen in a picture than man achieved at earlier stages. As we shall see, Gombrich did point out to us a most important and valuable fact about the relation- ship between seeing and painting and that is that at any one point of historical time men are dominated by the ways in which other men have represented their seeing. It cannot be true however that our way of seeing is dominated exclusively by artists' representa- tions. (In fact Waddington has shown that it may be influenced by such phenomena as flow diagrams and electron micrographs). 12 We see the world in other ways, ways which are not proposed by painters and sculptors. 28</page><page sequence="3">TRANSITIOIN 45 It appears then that Gombrich, despite his denial, has subscribed to the most important misconception of Western art history, the application of evolution to art, because he subscribes to the idea that there is a 'primitive' way of seeing. It is no good his telling us he is using the word 'primitive' in a scientific sense to mean an earlier stage in the growth of a man, sometime during childhood, and is therefore merely making a statement about the psychology of art when he obviously uses the word 'primitive' in a historical sense and regards Egyptian art, for example as somehow closer to child art. The representation of what we see as an immediate impression of the experience of looking through a window-frame is just as limited as the Egyptian artist's 'paratactic' vision, that is the combination of a series of parts of objects seen in full profile as if we had rotated them or walked round them instead of seeing them foreshortened or accommodated to our vision from one point in space, (paratactic here meaning that the parts of the object ate not related to one another by three- dimensional perspective). Apart from Gombrich's proposal that the history of art is a gradual moving away from 'the schematic' towards representation, it is difficult to see that the pre-industrial African art we are considering can fit the use of the term 'schematic'. Both these two des- criptions, Roger Fry's 'conceptual' and Gombrich's 'schematic', describe ways in which both Western artists and writers have regarded African art, but neither seem to bear much relation to what the African artist is doing. By 'conceptual' Fry and other writers have meant a type of art in which the artist symbolises what he knows about objects instead of what he sees. By 'schematic' Gombrich means the substitution of a particular object for a class of objects to which it bears a partial resemblance or which can be thought of when that object is looked at or used. So to conceptualise means to insist that a drawing of a man should contain two eyes even in a profile view because we know that a man has two eyes; to schematise, (in Gombrich's sense), means to depict an eye by a cowrie shell or by a bulging sphere with a I ole in it, although we know that an eye contains an iris, veins etc. The use of the term 'primitive' in such theories and books then implies an evolutionary system in which man has progressed from societies in which he made 'schematic' or conceptual representations to modern societies in which he has achieved illusionistic represen- tations. (Gombrich's book 'Art and Illusion' describes how man has learnt to create illusions of actually look- ing at the world in pictures in our modem Western society). How has it come about that modern art historians and art critics have gone on using the word 'primitive' and evolutionary theory when describing the art of alien cultures such as Africa? Evolutionary theories were fashionable at the end of the nineteenth century because they appeared to be more scientific-.and artists as well as art historians have been striving ever- since Leonardo da Vinci to be scientific above everything else. They were mortally afraid lest it should turn out that they should be made obsolete by the advance of scientific knowledge. (For a while, for instance, they copied the style of the photographer and nowadays they are still worried by the ease withs whieli their work can be reproduced). However the most important motivation of all for producing an evolutionary theory was the desire for technological values to retain their permanence. More than any other society in the world's history Western society of the 19th century wished its achievements to go down permanently on record. Its novelists laboured away at making monumental novels, its historians at monumental histories and its artists at vast historical paintings and huge monuments, its engi- neers at great bridges and roads of iron. Everything was built to last, everything seemed permanent. It seemed inconceivable that this society should be anything but the culmination of man's long evolutionary development and natural that a society dedicated to preserving the works of man should be superior to all those which had produced transitory artifacts. The only societies which were regarded as at all comparable and deserving of the name 'civilised' were those which had also built monumental works of great permanence, the Greeks, the Romans, the Egyptians, the Indians, the Chinese and possibly the Peruvians and the Mexicans. The desire for permanent records brought about another preoccupation which reaffirmed the idea of 'the primitive' and buttressed the evolutionary theory. Europeans in the 19th century had a passionate interest in sorting, collecting and classifying, for trying to fit every part of human history back to the beginnings of recorded time into an intellectual pattern. (The passion for collecting went back as far as the 16th century and reached a new zenith with the collections of cameos and intaglias of 18th century German and Italian noblemen, but the desire to fit the whole scheme into a logical and historical progression seems to have been peculiarly a nineteenth century concern). Repre- sented in philosophy by Hegel's 'Science of Logic', in social theory by Herbert Spencer's 'Social Evolution', in the philosophy of science by Haeckel's 'General Morphology of Organisms', in history by Humboldt's 'Decline and Fall of the Greek Republic', everything had its place in the history of progress towards the technocratically-centred state. In making these vast intellectual edifices, Europeans seemed to be conforming to the typology proposed by Wilhelm Worringer for Northern man in his 'Form in Gothic'. He suggested that the desire for vast intellectual constructions came from a similar desire to that which created Gothic cathedrals. "Just as Northern man was seized by a mania for artistic construction of buildings going far beyond all practical requirements, so he was seized also by a mania for intellectual construction which betrays the same need of becoming engrossed in a self-created activity of an abstract kind, whether logical or mechani- cal."13 This mania for intellectual construction of Worringer's Northern man reinforced the motivation for an evolutionary theory of art. It led to the demand for constant comparison and classification, and to the belief that a society which was not concerned with comparison and classification was 'primitive'. The demand to find qualities in works of art was converted into an end in itself. The act of comparison became a distinguishing feature by which to describe 'civilisation', and by which to distinguish it from 'un- civilised' societies who did not have the impulse to make intellectual constructions from systems of classi- fication. Roger Fry wrote in the Athenaeum of an exhibition of negro sculpture held at the Chelsea JBook 29</page><page sequence="4">TRANSITION 45 Club in 1920, "I have to admit that some of these things are great sculpture-greater than anything we produced even in the Middle Ages. Certainly they have the special qualities of sculpture in a higher degree. They have indeed great plastic freedom; that is to say, these African artists really conceive form in three dimensions... It is curious that a people who produced such great artists did not produce also a culture in our sense of the word. This shows that two factors are necessary to produce the cultures which distinguish civilised peoples. There must be of course, the creative artist, but there must also be the power of conscious critical appreciation and comparison... It is for want of a conscious critical sense and the intellectual powers of comparison and classification that the negro has failed to create one of the great cultures of the world, and not from any lack of the creative aesthetic impulse, nor from lack of the most exquisite sensibility and the finest taste." 14 Apart from the obvious absurdity of the statement, (we have only to think of the Verses of Ife divination of the Yorubas for an example of extraordinary intel- lectual powers of comparison and classification), 15 this statement betrays an art critic's view of the nature of art which derives from his profession as an art critic, as a professional connoisseur collecting and arranging objects and experiences in the same way that Gombrich's view betrays that of an art historian needing a continuity, a traditional invention, to which every work of art as a historical event can be referred. It was the intellectual mania for comparison and classification which created the profession of art critic, and also the profession of ethnography. It caused rich men to form private collections and governments and local councils to build museums for paintings and sculpture. In turn they needed men to tell them what to buy and exhibit. Art critics told them how to buy works of art; ethnographers how to buy specimens. The museums fitted Worringer's description by being neo-Gothic in architecture and Gothic in the classifica- tion chosen in the display of their contents. A good example is the Pitt-Rivers museum at Oxford in England. General Pitt-Rivers, founder of the Pitt-Rivers Museum, began by collecting firearms in 1851. "Noticing how progress from the simple to the more complex form often came about as a succession of very slight changes, it occurred to him that this sort of evolutionary progress might with advantage be studied not only in all kinds of weapons, but also in other arts and industries." 16 In 1883 he offered his collection of 15,000 specimens to the University of Oxford on condition that they built a museum to house it which they did, and put it in charge of the Professor of Zoology, thus confirming Pitt- River's own opinion when he wrote: "Human ideas as represented by the various products of human indus- try are capable of classification into general species, and varieties, in the same manner as the products of the vegetable and animal kingdoms and in their development from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous they obey the same laws." 17 General Pitt-Rivers also stipulated that the University should employ a person to lecture on the exhibits and they appointed the first lecturer in Anthropology in the United Kingdom, Edward Burnett Tylor. The museum now contains over a million arti- facts and still employs the method of classification introduced by General Pitt-Rivers himself. There are over ninety main headings in alphabetical order from 'Agriculture and Horticulture' to 'Writing and other means of conveying information'. To find African carved figures we would have to look under the heading 'Religion' until we came to 'Religious figures' among forty-five other sub-headings under 'Religion'. The intellectual mania which led to the creation of museums also led to the wholesale pillaging of so called 'primitive' societies for 'specimens'. In 1899 Thomas Masui, Director of the Museum of the Belgian Congo at Tervuren in Belgium could make an inventory of 20,300 Congolese art objects to be found in Europe. Of these, for example, 2,000 were at the Berlin Museum, 2,780 at the Trocadero, 18 in Paris, 3,000 in the museum of Leiden, 7,549 at Tervuren and 1,200 in the Vienna Museum. The Museum of Dresden had acquired 140 as early as 1886. Van Gennep wrote in 1914 that expedi- tions such as those of Frobenius had in a wholesale fashion completely destroyed the artistic foundations of some tribes without stopping to make any documenta- tion of the objects bought. 19 The collectors thought they were saving these objects for 'civilisation'. We know that the painters who introduced African art to the West in the first decade of the twentieth century were completely aware of the peculiarities of art historians and museum curators and of their strange mania, and excited at the possibilities of repudiating it by a new evaluation of the works collected. Roland Penrose, Picasso's friend and English biogra- pher has written that Picasso, "paid a visit to the museum of Historic sculpture at the Trocadero and found by chance that the ethnographical department contained a splendid collection of negro sculpture. Negro art in the Trocadero was esteemed only for its scientific value. There was then no attempt to represent the objects as works of art, on the contrary they were piled into badly-lit glass cases with complete disregard for those who might be interested in the striking originality of their form. This in some way made their discovery all the more exciting, and to this day Picasso remembers the emotion he felt at this first contact".20 The discovery then was all the more exciting because Picasso's painting was itself a form of protest against the categories which had been imposed on art by the mania for comparison and classification. Picasso told Francoise Gilot "When I went for the first time, at Derain's urging, to the Trocadero museum, the smell of dampness and rot there stuck in my throat. It depressed me so much I wanted to get out fast, but I stayed and studied."21 Picasso's 'discovery' was the discovery that objects heaped up in museums were also considerable works of art, valuable to him in his own works and, his 'dis- covery of African art' was part of the general discovery at the end of the nineteenth century that a number of sensations and experiences, previously considered to be outside the defining boundaries of what was known as art or 'the beautiful', should really be brought within those boundaries. As we shall see the roots of this change of attitude went back into the eighteenth century when the belief that 'the beautiful' was necessarily rational was gradually overthrown by the philosophers of the Romantic movement. It had a number of conse- quences in literature and art in the nineteenth century the 'black is beautiful' theory of later Romantics, for example.* Baudelaire's love of a mulatto mistress was noot unrelated to the title of his poems "Eleuizs d'o Mall". 30</page><page sequence="5">TRANSMON 45 It led in turn to the symbolist movement in poetry and the 'fauviste' movement in painting. This overthrowing of accepted ideas of the beautiful also led to the cultiva- tion of the familiar objects of everyday life in the paint- ings of the cubists and to their use of images from popular entertainers, 'Les saltimbanques'. The novelist and art critic J. J. Huysmans, seems to have shown an awareness of the implications of the symbolist movement for painters well in advance of everyone else. In 1876 he wrote a review of the Salon in 'Le Voltaire' in which he claimed to prefer the crudish posters advertising a cabaret or a circus to what he called the 'fiddle-faddle and jiggery-pokery' of the Ecole des Beaux Arts. He himself wrote a poem called 'Les Gousset' (published in his 'Croquis Parisiens' in 1880) in which he praised the diverse odours of feminine arm-pits. However Huysmans so far overthrew accepted canons of rationality in art and morality that he culti- vated 'black magic' and became so frightened by the ensuing nightmares that he turned to the Catholic religion instead. A similar fear of the irrational to that of Huysmans, may be seen at work in the Cubist movement, where the rectangular co-ordinates in a framed painting were emphasized as a new symbol of rationality until the end product was Mondrian's neo-plasticism. Picasso him- self, apart from a brief flirtation with Cubism in Bra- que's company, seems never to have 'played safe' but to have gone on to break new ground all his long life and, alone of all the Cubists who were influenced by pre-industrial African art at the beginning of this century it is Picasso himself who first introduced it into painting, who seems to have understood its signi- ficance. He used African forms in his large painting 'Les Desmoiselles D'Avignon' to create an ambiguous effect with 'figure and ground'. That is, he makes our eyes pay as much attention to the shape of the space surrounding the figures as to the shape of the space which they fill. We shall see that this deliberate creation of ambiguity, of the space in which we see a figure is a most important feature of African art and one which is used to assist members of social groups to rethink their position in those groups in such a way that they are continually revaluating the past and adapting themselves to change. For most of us who have grownup with Western-type education institutions, and this includes those of us educated in African schools and universities, it seems almost shocking to describe African art as impermanent and generally invisible. Art is a form of display for us. It is something that once created must be seen to have been created and must bring lasting prestige and honour to its owner as well as its creator. We find it extremely difficult to imagine a society in which it is not assumed that a work of art has permanent, inherent values and whose works of art are not permanently on display to give people pride in their culture and their 'civilisation'. If we were to make the imaginative effort required to consider the human values which make it important to hide indestructible works of art away and to produce them only on very special and important occasions, and to make most works of art destructible and of limited value, this might entail shutting up our museums and pulling down big public monuments. It might also entail a great plunge in value of famous paintings at public collections and the destruction of a great deal of the 'collateral' with which rich men buttress their fortunes. If it is true then that art in pre-industrial African society was produced with this set of assumptions which are so alien to those of our society, any attempt to introduce those assumptions must be revolutionary. What we must ask is whether it is possible to make use of the alien art without accepting its assumptions about the use of art in general? The Cubists thought that the art could be used without discovering the original intentions of its creators. In fact it seems as if these painters wanted to establish a new permanence. We are told that they wanted to substitute the creation of the object which lasted through the transient effects of light and atmosphere and, made a more lasting impression on the human consciousness, for the truth- fulness to a transitory moment which had been the aim of the impressionists. Before considering statements made by the Cubist painters or their friends, however, it is important to point out that painters and sculptors are notoriously ignorant of what it is they are actually doing when they paint or sculpt. None of the painters at the period which we are discussing here, (with the possible exception of Matisse), seems to have been clear in his own mind about the nature of his work or about its effects on himself or outside observers. Very often the remarks made by the artists in their writings about their activities seem to bear little or no resem- blance to the results in the works they produced. Their close friends who wrote about them do not seem to be any more accurate about the real motivation which produced the works. Art historians (e.g. Gombrich, whose theories we have already introduced), would like the aims and intentions of artists to be very cut and dried so that they can easily discuss whether the artist's works correspond to their intentions. 22 In dealing with the very recent history of art however it seems impossible to avoid tallking about vague and shadowy tendencies whose true nature may only become apparent with much great distance in time and we must resort to a great deal of subjective introspection about the psy- chological effects which the actual works have on us. If the works appear to have an effect on us which is radically different from the artists' expressed intentions, then it seems clear that one must consider the works themselves as superior evidence to the artists' statements or their friends' statements. The only way we can check our introspective discoveries about the works themselves is to find out whether they have the same effect on other observers. The recent history of art shows that the introduction of African art into the work of Picasso, Braque, and the Expressionists, created quite different effects in the works of later artists and writers than those which the earlier artists appear to have expressed, and that artists of the period, 1900-1914, may have been responsive to contemporary events and their own past in ways of which they were scarcely aware at the time; we and later observers on the other hand have been able to discover the responses they made to their own environment by looking more closely at their works. Nevertheless several recent writers have taken the statements which the artists and their friends made 31</page><page sequence="6">?S~ 1Xt1 * fl~~~~R R heq:L</page><page sequence="7">TRANSITION 45 at the time and used them as a means of approach to African art. In fact because the Cubists and the Expres- sionists were the first to appreciate the value of African sculpture as works of art and not as ethnographical specimens, the ethnographers and art historians have taken their statements at their face value and used them as a key to understanding African art and for their accounts of the effect of African art on Western art. To recapitulate then, the European artists at the end of the 19th century thought they were making statements about the permanent, timeless, and universal. To assist themselves, however, they introduced the art of people, (pre-industrial African people), who thought that works of art seeking to make statements about the permanent, timeless and universal were wrong in a moral sense and who also tried to avoid making works of art which would appear to be permanent because they feared their moral and social effects. Therefore there was a contradiction in the intentions of the Western artists and we must attempt to explain that contradiction. It is clearly present, for example, in the statements and writings of D. H. Kahnweiler, Picasso's dealer and personal friend, who provided one of the aesthetics of the' Cubist movement. He has said that the Cubists were looking for "what was really fundamental" com- pared with what was just "the habit of the age".23 When painting a house or other objects they looked for "an image of objects that was more detailed, more precise than can be seen in a single glance."24 They wanted to paint what was known of the object as well as what they saw of it. However at the same time "the very fact of introducing coloured forms that fix these sensations in a place, rectangular surface creates a certain: rhythm",25 and Kahnweiler quotes Picasso as saying, "of course, when I want to make a cup I'll show you that it is round, but the overall rhythm of the painting, the structure, may force me to show this roundness as square".26 According to Kahnweiler, when Picasso said this, he was saying that painting conferred a gestalt on the objects"27 or "what matters is the whole, the picture itself, and all of its parts must be equally important".28 To Kahnweiler the gestalt was a universal. It was already there before it was discovered. (Picasso, in fact probably recognised that it was the product of subjective feeling). There were therefore two distinct concepts: Kahnweiler said that the Cubists were looking for a good gestalt, but Picasso said: "you can paint pictures by matching up different parts of them so that they go quite nicely together, but they'll lack any kind of drama."29 This contradiction sums up the modern Western artists' dilemma when he rejected 'the classical', on the one hand a search for 'the truth', on the other band, the search for subjectivity, for individual psychological statements. Most twentieth century artists tried to reconcile the contradiction by an appeal to the true and universal, the cosmic, the divine. In this way they became merely the successors of the earlier reactions against the Renaissance and the Classical of the nine- teenth century. They belonged to the nineteenth century rather than to the twentieth century in the history of art. The Romantics, the Realists, the Naturalists, the Impressionists and Post-impressionists and the Sym- bolists had all been searching for their own kind of visible permanence, for their own objective reality and now, before the first world war they were to be joined by the Fauvists, the Cubists, the Expressionists, the Orphists, and the Musicalists. All were looking for some set of universal values to substitute for the classical. The search for a set of permanent values had been a pre-occupation of Western art for a long time. It had entered Western society at the time of the Greeks with Pythagoras and had been handed down by the artists and writers of the Renaissance in their own particular form of neo-Platonism. According to the writers of the Renaissance "the ideal form" of a painting, sculpture or building had been discovered by the Greeks, and it was vitally necessary for artists and writers to preserve the Greeks' discoveries, their "doctrine", in their own work. This had the curious result that the Greek human form became the symbol of the rational ideal of Western man during the Italian Renaissance. Its basic tenets were set out by Alberti in his 'Treatise on Painting' written about 1435, and in his 'De Architectura'. Here the proportions of the human figure discovered by the Greeks, were set out and these proportions made into measurements for buildings. The Greeks "trying to outdo the rich Asian and Egyptian buildings in genius and quality, distinguished between the good and the less good and resorted to nature, following her intentions instead of mixing incongruous things".3 0 But during the seventeenth century the Academies, revealingly enough called after a park in Athens in which Plato taught his pupils philosophy, began to teach that the dissection and measurement of classical statues would provide values for painters which were superior to the observation of nature itself. In particular the French Academy established by Colbert in the reign of Louis XIV provided a monopoly for painters who, followed its rules of classical measurements and made it obligatory for court painters to follow these precepts. Pevsner tells us that to the academicians "a work of art was not intrinsically an integer, but a series of individual attitudes and gestures, of oratory, composition, etc."31 Academies were established on the model of the French Academy in England, Holland and Germany, and all laid down classical precepts for artists. The academies placed a great deal of reliance on copies of sculpture brought back from Rome, but a number of writers in the eighteenth century revived the Renaissance notion that the Greeks had discovered the ideal human form but for motives peculiar to eighteenth century rationalism. Most prominent of the writers to insist on the supremacy of the Classical Greek form was Johann Joachim Winckelmann whose 'History of Ancient Art', published 1763, is regarded as the progenitor of modern art history and who has also been described as 'the father of archaeology'. Winckel- mann appeared to establish his supremacy purely as a result of his power as the first truly modern writer about art, but his writings were so highly regarded that he became the Pope's Librarian and a guide to the Anti- quities of Rome to the noblemen of Europe. In contrast with the Renaissance painters, such as Alberti, he seems to anticipate nineteenth century 'alienation' although his theories differ from those of the nineteenth century in his 'adherence' to the idea of the doctrine or the truth which was revealed to the Ancient Greeks. Perhaps the domination of his theory of art for the next two 33</page><page sequence="8">TRANSITION 45 centuries, (for we shall see there are variations of it still at large in the world today)32 is that artists and art historians wished to believe in the existence of a pure form which had been revealed in ancient times in the fact of the dissolution of public values which the world was going through as a result of the industrial revolution even at Winckelmann's time. Winckelmann's sense of a Greek arcadia was allied to a distaste of the modern art of his times and in particular to a dislike of the Baroque with its sense of everything moving and its representation therefore of an uncertainty about lasting values. In a recent and penetrating biography of Win- ckelmann, Wolfgang Leppmann has said that for Winckelmann, "the sculpted and preferably the nude form as an expression of Gestalt in a neo-Platonic sense, i.e. as a phenomenon that occurs in nature and in art, serves to remind us of the divine as the 'ultimate aim of art and its very core". 3 3 He also points out that in his 'History of Ancient Arts' Winckelmann wrote that he was disturbed by the protruding lips of Moors which he explained by reference to the African climate and also by the slanting eyes of Orientals which dis- tracted the "T" formed by the horizontal of the eye- brows and the vertical extending from the top of the nose to the point of the chin. They could not represent a universally acceptable standard of beauty which was acknowledged to exist by people in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe."34 When the painter of American Indians, Benjamin West, visited Rome and told Win- ckelmann that the Apollo Belvedere looked like a young Mohawk warrior, Winckelmann regarded it as proof that "the Greek divinities as fashioned by the great sculptors were indeed archetypal figures of man."35 At the beginning of the nineteenth century then the Renaissance ideal of the Classical human form had acquired almost a strangle-hold on all theory about art through the influence of the seventeenth and eigh- teenth century academies and the writings of Winckel- mann. Throughout the nineteenth century, artists and writers seemed to be fighting to free themselves from the strangle-hold. Gauguin, for example, in his letter of October 1897 to Georges-Daniel de Montfried: "The great error is the Greek, however beautiful it may be." But the artists and writers fought their battles outside the public institutions and without recognition from official bodies. The Classical ideal was still taught in schools and universities; it was not until near the end of the nineteenth century that the art historians taught that there were other values in art apart from the Classical ones, and then it seemed as if their motiva- tion was a nationalistic one. There was then a reap- praisal of the Gothic. The art historians did not reject the evolutionary theory in the history of art, but they did criticise the idea that there was a period known as 'the dark ages' in which the Classical went into disuse and art returned to its 'primitive' beginnings. Alois Riegl, for example, the Vienese art historian, in his "Spatromische Kunstindustrie", first published in 1901, argued that Renaissance art had gained as much from the Gothic as from the Classical. In Wilhelm Worrin- ger's "Form in Gothic" which I have quoted earlier, the reappraisal of Gothic, became a definite assertion of what European art owed to the special temperament of Northern man and in particular the Germans. (A similar movement started in Russia as early as 1872, but perhaps the earliest nationalistic movement in visual art was that of the Nazarenes.)

Gothic art was concerned with the projections and the hollows of the exterior surface of the material from which a sculpture was made or from which a relief was carved on a wall surface. In Gothic book illustrations we can feel our way around the picture. The space is conveyed by the surfaces of the figures and rooms so that we cannot move beyond them. Classical art broke down the confining solid surfaces however and made them trans- parent so that we could see what was going on beyond them. In fact we were allowed to look to the furthest limits of vision into a space filled by air and light. Alberti wrote in his 'Treatise on Painting,' "Painters should know that they move in a plane surface with their lines and that, in filling the areas thus defined with colour, the only thing they seek to accomplish is that the form of things seen appear upon the plane surface as if it were made of transparent glass." He also said that he imagined the rectangle to be an open window. Why should a concern with infinite space lead to a concern for producing an illusion of a window-frame? We have seen that according to a' more recent art historian, Ernst Gombrich, the preoccupation was historical. Having once started producing this kind of illusion artists could not stop. Imagining our cone of vision to be intersected by a window-frame was the best way to produce an illusion of what we actually see, but artists had to extend the enquiry to the furthest limits of their skill and continue the enquiry which had been started by other artists. They tried to behave in fact like scientists.36 Riegl and Worringer seemed to write as if they knew what the intentions of non-representational artists were, as if they could derive their intentions from their 'style', as if the style told us enough about the culture of the artists to be able to say they intended to express their culture, but Gombrich is critical of all art history which ascribes 'intention' to artists when the fact of these 'intentions' is non-verifiable. We know that an artist intended to represent an object when he represented it, bOut how do we know what he intended to do when he did not represent an object? We have said that Gombrich wants art history to be scientific.37 For reasons of logical tidiness he presents Riegl and Worringer to us as if they- said that non- representational artists made a choice, that they deli- berately chose to express their own society and time by non-representational art. He asks how we could verify the truth of such a statement. How would one know that an artist deliberately refrained from the exact representation of an object, or chose to represent objects with a particular style'?38 He has pointed out that the successful painting of an illusion, that is, a painting which can help us to see part of the world exactly as if we were looking at it, (as particular instances he refers to the paintings of Constable) depend on a long history of presenting illusions. From the period of Classical Greek art until the nineteenth century, painters were discovering new ways of creating illusions which they passed on from one to another. Without the benefit of earlier discoveries, the later ones could not have been made. Therefore the painter who did not present illusions ~of reality, such- as the Egyptian mural artist of the period 2,000 B.C., did not deliberately or con- sciously reject the idea of doing so. He could not possibly have known how to do so without the benefits of technical developments made at a later date. How- ever, Gombiich's argument does not tell us why these artists confined themselves to the techniques of creating the optical illusion of the external appearance of nature in comparison with societies who had no interest in the discovery of those techniques. We do not claim that they knew of them and deliberately did not use them. Obviously the artistic intentions described by Riegl and Worringer arose from a different under- standing of the way of using visual art, not from a deliberate refusal to use techniques which were probably not dreamed of by the artists themselves. Why however did they not develop these techniques? Why were they not interested in scientific illusion? It is argued here that the artistic 'intentions' of artists in African society caused them to develop a completely different set of techniques, and one which the artists of the European Renaissance did not choose to explore because they had quite different artistic 'intentions. It is not argued that they deliberately chose to be 'non- representational'. The question then might be put the other way round. Why did the artists of the European Renaissance confine themselves to the discovery of techniques of producing the illusion of natural figures and landscapes, from a fixed viewpoint, instead of investigating the techniques of creating space and movement which were explored by the African artists? In answering this question we are answering a wider question about the difference between post-Renaissance Western artists until the date of the first world war and the African artist in the pre-industrral African society. A concern for producing the illusion of space on a two- dimensional, rectangular plane surface does seem to be an extraordinarily limited concern, and so does a concern with monochrome, representational sculpture. What caused the European artist to be so limited in his intentions? Why did he choose these particular kinds of artistic activity and no others? The general answer we are proposing is that the artist of the Classical Renaissance was searching for an objective reality, for a metaphysical kind of permanence, which was also a spiritual reality. He believed the world to have been made by God and that this caused it to be beautiful. If he could discover this beauty he had discovered 'eternal' truth and had secured for himself immortality not only in this world but in the next. There were however two conflicting ideas of how to discover 'the Objective Reality'. One was that it was a pattern in the world which corresponded to a set of divine patterns in heaven and all that was needed was to find the patterns in the world and compare them with the heavenly ones. This first attempt at a discovery of 'the divine order' achieved by the careful application of measurements and proportion was that of Alberti, and in his treatises on his methods we find one kind of Platonism, a belief that God gave man the memory of a set of ideal forms or types. It is this Platonic philo- sophy which led Alberti to employ his anthropomorphic theory, the theory that the most beautiful human form can be created from a selection of a number of the forms chosen by artists as those they considered to be the best forms. "We have taken the trouble to set down the principal measurements of a man. We did not, however, choose this or that single body, but as far as possible 35</page><page sequence="10">TRANSITION 45 we have tried to note and set down in writing the highest beauty scattered, as if in calculated portions, among many bodies. . . We have chosen a number of bodies considered by the skilful to be the most beautiful and have taken the dimensions of each of those." 39 Alberti thought that man was fitted with a special sense which enabled him to perceive examples of the ideal beauty in nature and to distil the ideal from them in his art. However if a man was given the sense by means of which he could discover what corresponded to the divine order in nature, that did not mean that he himself was the reincarnation of the divine. Alberti's Platonism was a very distinct and separate doctrine from that of the neo-platonists of the second half of the fifteenth century such as Marsilio Ficino who initiated a move- ment, Panofsky tells us, which "conquered all Europe and, changing in content according to time and place, remained a major force in Western culture for many centuries".40 According to Ficino, man exists in a hierarchy of being. God or pure being is above him and animals and plants and inanimate beings are below him, but God has given him a soul which contains all the know- ledge that God himself possesses and through retreating into himself and communing with his soul man should try to attain a knowledge of the divine. All men have been given a desire to attain this knowledge and this causes them to live in a continual state of melancholy, an inward striving for a knowledge of the sphere of being. However as God created the universe all things contain the divine and "knowledge is achieved by a correspon- dence of the mind with things."'41 and "truth is the correspondence of the mind with things."42 Man, being of the same genius as the author of the universe could "make the heavens if he could obtain the instru- ments and the celestial matter."43 Knowledge of the truth is often obtained by poets in states of madness, "in their madness they sing many admirable things which afterward, when their fury has lessened, they do not well understand themselves, as if they had not themselves made the utterance, but God himself had announced it through them as through trumpets." Ficino also emphasizes the idea that groups of men can attain to a knowledge of the divine truth by their love for one another when they are seeking the truth together, an idea which was especially characteristic of the German Expressionist group, 'Die Brucke', four hundred years later.44 For Ficino love of a man for the higher and lower states of being was the most im- portant means of understanding, and this understanding was increased when men sought the truth together in groups dedicated to the search. We might describe the differences between the two major movements in twentieth century art which have been influenced by African art, the Cubists and the Expressionists, as paralleling the differences between Alberti and Ficino, and continuing that division nearly five hundred years later. It eventually became clear that a painting or a sculp- ture was itself an object which had a functional value in society. It was at that point when European and Western artists began to appreciate the functional value of a work of art that they approached most nearly in their intentions to the traditional African artists. African art had helped to bring about a revolution but its in- fluence in the revolution was not understood at the time. It was an indirect influence whose effects wlere felt only years after it had insidiously introduced itself. In early twentieth-century Western art the personalities paintings reflected were given a kind of bogus vitality because they were supposed to be products of an extra- temporal 'spirit', because they were supposed to portray 'reality'. No pre-industrial African artists believed in the bogus permanence of 'the spirit'; forhim every work of art had immediate and specific relevance. Having outlived its time and having been taken out of its context it was no longer valid. Nevertheless African works of art more than any other so-called 'primitive' works were regarded by European artists as tributes to the permanency of 'the spirit'. Paradoxically they had the opposite effect. Once their forms were adopted, because of their own nature as visual objects, they in fact served to demonstrate the limited validity of the works they influenced and showed how the maximum value of any painting or sculpture was to be obtained from this very quality of impermanence, this relevance to the here and now. By the end of the first world war very few painters or sculptors expected their work to make a special artistic communication about the nature of reality. It was becoming more obvious in fact that visual works of art did not necessarily convey information at all. They could not provide us with information about either a strictly limited event in time and space like a scientific experiment or with more general extra-temporal, extra- spatial information about the actual universe. What paintings did was to reveal facts about an individual personality or the group personality of his society. Paintings in fact had a dual role. They informed us what the various personalities were like and they in- fluenced those personalities themselves by reflecting the image they created back to them (as an example we can think of the way in which the personality of Picasso's paintings has affected our whole society). To sum up there is one particular feature of the use of visual art in traditional African society which has made it relevant to most modern Western artists' ex- perience and that is its use as a public performance at specific times and places. They have rejected timeless inherent values in pictures and sculptures because of the sense they make of a world changing so rapidly that no one is able to erect lasting monuments. It is the accidental idea that a work of art has lasting, inherent values which has turned it into an investment, but the modern occidental artist despairs of creating invest- ments for stock-brokers. It seems to be a method of destroying his work to turn it into an investment which is always appreciating as a financial asset, because it is alleged to have timeless values. In an article written for The Observer45 about the sale for five and a half million dollars of a portrait by Velasquez of his mulatto assistant, Nigel Cosling wrote that first he burst out laughing, but then a sense of indignation took over. He had witnessed a public indignity and a great painter had been affronted. The transformation of a genuine creation "wrung from the artists's doubts through suffering" into "an objet d'art to be tossed from saleroom to saleroom" caused a young contemporary artist to make sculpture out of ice or to draw on sand or float monuments out to sea. Obsolescence became equated with human values and eternity meant death. It is this attitude which has caused Andy Warhol to say that he does not wish his paintings to last and that he deliberately makes them of non-durable materials, 36</page><page sequence="11">TRANSMON 45 and which is carried to absurdity in auto-destructive art, for example Tinguely's Homage to New York, an assemblage, twenty-three feet long and twenty-seven high of "one hundred wheels, fifteen motors, a piano, an addressograph machine, a baby's bath tub, klaxons and chemical liquids" which was finally destroyed by fire by the artist and his assistant. The modem artist nowadays then seems to have a complete disregard for the lasting values of his work, but the post-Renaissance painter was an amateur chemist who spent a lot of his time trying to make his work as permanent as possible. He was concerned with manufacturing 'art treasures' and 'timeless statements'. His attitude was totally the opposite of the modern artist who throws a few sheets of torn paper into a cnorer or leaves a number of coloured discs on the floor for the spectator to arrange in any position he likes. Modern African writers have sometimes des- cribed this behaviour of the modern Western artist as decadent, symptomatic of a dying culture, but the conception of art it implies is much nearer to the African tradition of art than appears at first sight. It would be wrong, however, to represent pre-Indus- trial African art as if it merely contained 'builtin- obsolescene'. It is deliberately given a limited life, but its life has controlled limits. The spirits of the elders with which it is connected go back to the earth after a very few generations, but they are not immediately replaceable. It is recognised that their continued presence is indispensable to the community until a number of years after theil death. The rationale of African art is therefore to be contrasted not only with the Western perpetuation of outdated values but with the immediate replacement or yesterday's goods by our computer age. African art reflects a desire that the society should go on living without carrying forward a continuous burden inherited from the dead and without the immediate destruction of a useful inheritance. n 1.
