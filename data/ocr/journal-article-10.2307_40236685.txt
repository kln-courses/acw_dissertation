<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Signifìcance of thè Speeches in Plato's Symposium Kenneth Dorter ι In the Phaedrus, the Symposium* s sister dialogue (written at nearly the same time, it is the only other dialogue devoted to speeches about Eros), Socrates suggests that "every discourse ought to be con- structed like an animal, having a certain body of its own, so that it is neither headless nor footless, but has a middle and extremities composed appropriately to one another and to the whole" (264c2-5). And yet thè usuai interprétation of the Symposium regards it as written in a manner directly opposed to this principle.1 It is usually seen as a collection of seven nearly unrelated speeches, only three of which (those of Aristophanes, Socrates and Alcibiades) have any philosophical content, Socrates' alone being philosophically im- portant. On this interprétation, more than half the Speeches could have been omitted without affecting the dialogue's philosophical content; they are merely padding or ornamentation of some sort. If this were correct, Piato would be inviting the same criticism (and ridicule) that Lysias is subjected to in the Phaedrus. The alter- native is that the structure of the Symposium is more complex than is usually supposed, and it is this alternative that I shall ex- plore. It has often been observed that there is a certain progression in the quality of the speeches: Aristophanes' speech is certainly superior to those of his three predecessors, and Socrates' is superior to all f ive of his predecessors. But this view is not without difficul- ties. What of Agathon's speech, which follows Aristophanes', and yet (along with Phaedrus') seems to be the worst of the lot? And why should Alcibiades' speech follow Socrates' more important one? Moreover, it will be seen that Socrates replies in his speech to each of the previous speakers, but in a différent order from the Kenneth Dorter is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 215</page><page sequence="2">216 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLÀTO'S SYMPOSIUM original présentation.2 What is the relationship between thèse two séquences? The view of a progression among the Speeches is, I believe, essen- tially correct but oversimplified, and needs to be expanded. First of ail it should be noted that the Speeches are intended to be not merely about Eros, but in pr aise o/Eros (177a f). Accordingly, each speech must présent not only a view of Eros, but also a concept of goodness according to which Eros is praised. The philosophical adequacy of each speech must therefore be measured by two standards: the adequacy of its conception of Eros and the adequacy of its conception of goodness.3 In the second section of this paper I argue that each speech corrects and transcends its predecessor's conception not of Eros, but of why Eros is good. In the third section I argue that in Socrates' speech each of the previous portrayals of Eros is corrected (in ascending order of quality) and its kernel of truth incorporated into Socrates' position. In both cases the inadequacy of each position is made manifest by an inter- nai instability which leads to the speech's réfutation. II Near the beginning of his speech, Phaedrus argues that Eros '"is the cause of the greatest goods for us", (178cl f ). This goodness is, he tells us, "Shame in shameful things and ambition in beautiful things," resulting in the performance of "great and beautiful deeds." Eros is good, therefore, because it results in beautiful deeds. Phaedrus' standard of goodness is beauty - in particular, beautiful deeds. We should expect Phaedrus, as a rhetorician, to be primarily con- cerned with appearances, as is evident in the dialogue bearing his name (259e7-260a4). There, however, Socrates shows the inade- quacy of confining one's investigation to appearances (260a5ff); and the inadequacy of using beauty as the criterion for goodness is made evident in the Symposium. In ail Phaedrus' examples it is evident that his criterion for beautiful deeds is courage and self- sacrifice. Thus he says that a lover "would choose to die many times" (179a5) rather than leave his station. But is it not obvious that under certain conditions it is better to leave one's station and retreat? It is good to be courageous, but not to be foolhardy. We are later told, for example, that the courageous Socrates considered it better to retreat than to stay at his post under certain conditions</page><page sequence="3">KENNETH DORTER 217 (220e8).4 Nevertheless, retreat is not beautifitl; it is more beautiful to defy overwhelming odds and perish trying, against ali reason, to hold one's position. Το give one's life for another is a romantically appealing and, as Phaedrus tells us, a very beautiful act - more beautiful (because more selfless) than doing similar service to another while trying to preserve one's own life. Thus Phaedrus condemns Orpheus' descent into thè underworld, and approves his destruction, because he acted "softly" (179d4) in going alive to Hades, rather than being willing to kill himself for Eurydice, as Alcestis had for Admetus. In making this judgment, however, Phaedrus exposes the inadequa- cy of his own position; although it might hâve been more "beau- tiful" for Orpheus to kill himself to be in Hades with Eurydice, it would certainly not hâve been better. Alcestis knew that the gods would spare Admetus' life in exchange for hers, but Orpheus, on the contrary, knew that Eurydice's only hope depended precisely on his remaining alive and taking her back with him to the realm of the living. Phaedrus is thus made to employ an analogy whose very untenability demonstrates the limitations of his attempt to under- stand goodness as "beautiful deeds." Pausanias, another rhetorician, also uses beautiful deeds as the standard of goodness (18Oe5f). However, his conception of the nature of beautiful deeds is more adequate to such a standard than the romantic conception of Phaedrus: according to Pausanias, beautiful actions are those performed in accordance with an un- written law (181e3 f). This unwritten law differs for the lover and the beloved. The law according to which the beauty of a lover' s actions is judged is that to attain the beloved is beautiful and only failure is ugly; so that the lover, in his attempt to attain victory, may commit the most disgraceful or ugly acts, including even sacrilège (182d9-183b7). The unwritten law which measures the beauty of the actions of the be- loved, on thè other hand, is that he may do anything whatever to get his lover to teach him virtue (184b5 f). In both cases, then, the law is that the end justifies the means - only the ends (success or virtue) differ for them. The good, according to Pausanias, is ultimately, therefore, the "law" of selfishness: everything is subordinate to the attainment of one's personal goal. Pausanias uses this unwritten law as a criterion for evaluating written law. The laws of Elis and Boeotia are "bad," he says, due to</page><page sequence="4">218 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM laziness, and those elsewhere in Ionia are "bad" due to cowardice (1 82bl-d4) ; the Athenian law is better, but "not easy to understand" (184d4f). It does not, he admits, sanction thè pederasty he advo- cates (183c4), but he insists that the law should be regarded not as a strict injunction but as a test (184al f), a means for the lover and beloved to test each other's worth. It would not, therefore, regulate the actions of the lover and beloved and would allow them to apply their own (unwritten) law. To identify goodness with lawfulness is not only philosophically inadequate, it is a sign of philosophical failure. Pausanias himself just bore witness that laws are everywhere différent, and so such a position entails the déniai of any univocal, or even consistent, conception of goodness. Moreover, he also conceded that not all laws are equally good, which reflects an extra-legal concept of goodness. Pausanias' position is, in some degree, an attack upon law. Public law is always opposed to selfishness, since it must compromise the individualities of the Citizens and require sacrifices of their personal interest in order to effect a domestic harmony. An advocate of selfishness is a subverter, however subtle, of law. That is why Pausanias denied the obvious intention of Athenian law, by calling it '*not easy to understand," and by asserting that it is meant as a test, rather than an injunction; and that is why his ultimate concern is with the unwritten ("naturai") law of selfishness, rather than with lawfulness proper. However, as Pausanias' opposition to the laxity of the laws of Elis and Boeotia shows, selfishness needs law in order to prosper. As a rhetorician, Pausanias is skilled in interpreting and bending the law to his own advantage (as he did with the Athenian law in his speech). Although he does not want the law to be too strict or straightforward (182bl-d4), he would like it strict enough to benefit "wise speakers" (182b2). Pausanias' selfishness stands in need of law because law gives rhetoricians an advantage over non- rhetoricians: in this sensé, too, the law is a "test." Pausanias is in favor not of public liberty but of privilège: it would be to his ad- vantage for everyone to be subject to the law but himself (and, unavoidably, others like him). Just as Pausanias' observation, that laws differ from place to place and are not equally good, showed the inadequacy of Statute law as the standard of goodness, his advocacy of Statute law (and especially οι strict Statute law) reveals the similar inadequacy of the unwritten law of selfishness. Since selfishness demands to be an</page><page sequence="5">KENNETH DORTER 219 exception, to be privileged, it cannot apply thè same standard both to itself and others; and this rejection of universality makes it in- capable of serving as an adequate criterion for goodness or any other universal quality. To assign a universality to selfishness would be self-contradic- tory, as thè conflicting wills might thwart every ambition - which is why thè supposed conflict of wills in thè "state of nature" is said to have resulted in thè voluntary surrender of selfishness, thè social contract. Similarly, it is self-contradictory to equate goodness with selfishness: some things that are good for one man will be bad for another, and "good" will not, therefore, denote anything univocal or consistent. This equivocality and relativity can be avoided only by finding a single, and therefore univocal, standpoint for judgment ; and such a standpoint, to be singular, must be either that of thè whole or of one individuai.5 But thè former abstracts from individ- uality and thus negates selfishness, and thè latter would be absurd, as it would limit thè extension of "good" to a brief duration and particular piace. The "naturai" law of selfishness thus stands both in need of and in opposition to Statute law. Because of this tension and instability, nei- ther selfishness (any more than Statute law) alone, nor both together, can act as a stable standard for judgment of goodness in generai. Eryximachus, thè medicai scientist, is thè first speaker to give an account of thè goodness of Eros based on theoretical or scientific principles. It is from medicine, he says, that he has seen how great Eros is (186a7f). Goodness and badness are, accordingly, under- stood as health and unhealthiness (186b8-c4). Things are judged to be good insofar as they are conducive to health, and apparently on this basis alone weather (188c5) and divination (188b6f) can be considered good. Although it is more sophisticated to equate goodness with thè determinate concept of health than with thè somewhat relativistic concepts of courage or law, this équation also is inadequate. There is much that we regard as good which is not healthy. On one hand, this is true of ali types of self-sacrifice such as hard work, adventure, and courage in generai. It is therefore significant that Eryximachus' speech is thè only one in thè dialogue that omits ali mention of courage. In fact, at one piace (188dl-6) he incidentally mentions four of thè five "Socratic virtues": knowledge,6 piety, tempérance, and justice; thè fifth virtue, courage, is entirely left out. Courage is one of Eryximachus' "omissions" (188el).</page><page sequence="6">220 THE SIGNinCANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM On the other hand, self-indulgence, or pleasure - as well as self- sacrifice - is often considered good even though it may be un- healthy. Eryximachus himself is forced to admit this. He indicates that even thè "base Eros" - which he identified with unhealthiness - is good insofar as it affords pleasure ; and thus it must be allowed to be indulged, although it must be used very sparingly and be curbed before it destroys health (187el). But if thè unhealthy Eros can in any way be beneficiai, the criterion for goodness transcends health, and health cannot be identified with the good. Thus Eryximachus' speech, too, reveals its own réfutation. Just as Eryximachus conceives health as a harmony of opposites in generai (186d5 f), it is hère seen to be a "harmony" of, or mean between, Phaedrus' ideal of self-sacrifice and Pausanias' contrary ideal of self-indulgence. The ideal of health opposes both extremes: by means of its principle of self-preservation it stands opposed to self-sacrifice, and by means of its principle of regimen it stands opposed to self-indulgence. It is not, however, adequate to the de- mands of this synthesis. On the one hand, as Eryximachus had to concede, it is not capable of accounting adequately for the attrac- tion of unhealthy pleasures, nor, therefore, of effectively over- coming them. On the other hand, his blindness to the possible desir- abilityof self-sacrifice shows its inabilityto account for human tran- scendence - the aspiration for a good viewed as higher than man. Although health stands between the two previous concepts, its narrow materialism is inadequate to embrace them in an effective synthesis. This failure to corne to terms with the possibility of a good higher than man is overcome in Aristophanes' conception of goodness: piety. We are told by Aristophanes that man's current state is a punishment for his excessive ambition, which led him to attack the gods (190b5 f), and that, consequently, if we are not pious we may be punished again (193a3 f). Eros is good because he is our "leader and generai" in our striving to be pious (193a7-bl), and because it is he who gives us reason to hope that our piety will be rewarded (193d2 f). The goal which Eros sets for us - the restoration of the state we enjoyed in the Golden Age - is one which can be attained only as a reward for piety. Therefore, since Eros is conducive to piety, it is good. Is piety an adequate conception of goodness for man? The ultimate goal of this piety is to attain our pristine condition, with, however, the élimination of our former ambitiousness. Aristophanes</page><page sequence="7">KENNETH DORTER 221 compares man in that pristine state to cicadas (191c), a comparison which reminds us of thè story of thè cicadas in thè Symposium? s sister dialogue, thè Phaedrus. In thè Phaedrus (259b6 f ) we are told that thè cicadas were originally men who, like thè pristine men of Aristophanes, were Uranian in genesis. Also like thè men in Aristophanes' projectedblessed state, they were utterly content and unambitious; when thè Muses were bora they were so overcome by pleasure that, in their perfect contentment, they neglected nourish- ment until they began to die unawares. To save them, thè Muses changea them into cicadas, which, it is claimed, need no nourish- ment to live. This story, of which we are reminded by Aristophanes' metaphor, suggests thè difficulty in his position: would a philosopher regard perfect piety and lack of ambition as a good thing for man? Such a life might not lead to thè dying out of thè human race, as in thè story of thè cicadas, but would it not lead to a spiritual decay? Content and without ambition, man would cease to be adventure- some and creative. His life would be no différent from that of thè irrational animais, such as cicadas. This hardly seems a "good" vocation for man. If Aristophanes' daim of the desirability of his projected blessed state is thus open to doubt, his désignation of Eros as "our leader and generai" in this project is even more dubious. Eros as the means to piety? The very idea seems incongruous, as Aristophanes himself inadvertently attests when he mentions that Eros is respon- sible for adultery (191d7-e2), an act of impiety against Hera, the protectress of marriage. If impiety implies some sort of acquiescence, and Eros means striving for whatever we lack that seems beautiful or good (201c4-5), tension and incompatibility between the two is inévitable. Eros is, in fact, a function of our impious ambition. For ambition, too, denotes a striving for an apparent good that we lack. Thus, in the Phaedrus (238al-c4), Eros is called a species of hybris. Eros' im- piety is perhaps most evident in Aristophanes' own portrait. Eros is thè desire for our other half, but we lack our other half precisely because Zeus decreed and ordained that we be divided from it as a punishment. Eros' desire to be reunited (Kterally, if possible) with our other half is thus precisely a refusai to accept the dictâtes of the gods; it is impious in its very origin and nature. How, then, can Eros be conducive to piety? Aristophanes tells us that it is because Eros hopes to achieve its goal of reunion as a</page><page sequence="8">222 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM reward for piety. But in that case, it is piety that is in the service of Eros - not vice versa, as Aristophanes would have us believe. The value of piety is not, then, intrinsic, but lies in its utility for our ambi- tion. The very grounds on which Aristophanes tries to justify piety over against ambition shows instead the inseparability of ambition from our nature : even the appeal of piety is in its utility for ambition. This inseparability suggests how emasculated our nature must be- come, should we be deprived of our inhérent ambitiousness. If Eros did cease when, as a reward for piety, we were reunited with our other half, and if ambition, too, ceased because of our fear of renewed punishment, how could we consider ourselves thus better off, living a life no better than that of cicadas? The price we must pay for the peace of mind that comes with release from Eros and making our peace with the gods7 is the loss of that which sets us apart from the beasts: the possibility of striving and transcendence. By introducing the concept of piety, Aristophanes re-establishes a standard of goodness which, like Phaedrus' (179bl-3, 180a7), is grounded in the divine rather than human. His position thus stands above and opposed to that of Eryximachus. But, because piety is opposed to ambition, he must renounce man's striving to become godlike - an ambition which, as we shall see, was implicit in Eryximachus' speech. For Aristophanes, our relation to the divine is thus at the expense of the possibility of human transcendence. It is in Agathon's conception of goodness that this disjunction is reconciled. Eros is "most beautiful and most good," says Agathon (195a7 f, 196b4 f), who is thus the first speaker explicitly to distinguish between beauty and goodness.8 For him the good is virtue (196M-5). In the dialogues9 virtue is generally divided into courage, justice, tempérance and either wisdom or piety. The previous Speeches have eulogized the virtues of courage (Phaedrus), justice (Pausanias), tempérance (Eryximachus) and piety (Aristophanes). In his dis- cussion of virtue, Agathon discusses each of these (196b6-d4) except piety, for which he substitutes wisdom (196d5 f). Wisdom and piety are analogous in that both enable us to base our behavior and thoughts on the highest, most divine principles. But wisdom, unlike piety, is not content to act on principles established on faith, without understanding. A man who seeks to be wise seeks to transcend the temporal and fragmentary perspec- tive of human finitude and attain the timeless conspectus of the divine: wisdom is an attribute of the gods (204al f). Man's attempt</page><page sequence="9">KENNETH DORTER 223 at wisdom, therefore, is thè attempt not to obey thè gods but to emulate them. By introducing thè concept of virtue that includes wisdom, and is therefore grounded on principles higher than man, Agathon préserves Aristophanes' surpassing of thè humanistic science of health presented by Eryximachus; and because he replaces Aristophanic piety with wisdom, he is able to restore to thè notion of goodness thè élément of striving and transcendence which Aristophanes was forced to renounce. In this way, Agathon in some measure synthesizes thè positive content in thè antithetical speeches of Eryximachus and Aristophanes. The poverty of Agathon's speech does not lie in his conception of goodness, which is more adequate than that of his predecessors, but in his conception of thè nature of Eros and in thè wretched logic by which he argues his position. His conception of goodness as virtue is, however, not entirely adequate. He begins by saying that whereas thè speakers prior to him praised Eros only by observing thè goods that it gave to man, he proposes to encomiate Eros according to its own nature, and to discuss its gifts only subsequently (194e5 f). But surely it is ironie that thè one speech which boasts of praising Eros as it is in itself, prior to any considération of its relation to man, should use human virtue as its criterion. There is something paradoxical about thè attempt to praise a deity (and an anthropomorphic one, at that) in terms of virtue, and yet to do so in abstraction from man. What meaning or content can virtue possibly hâve, except with référence to man? Virtue means human excellence; it refers to what is highest in human nature. To attempt to conceive virtue in isolation from its connection with man is to risk losing sight of its spécifie function and meaning, and thus conceiving it inappropriately. This is precisely what happens in Agathon's case. If his concep- tion were correct, virtue would be entirely beyond thè reach of most, if not all, men; and thus few men, if any, could become good or, therefore (195a5-7), happy. Agathon spécifies wisdom as a compo- nent of virtue, but has just acquiesced in thè suggestion that wisdom may be very rare indeed: Socrates had suggested that perhaps not even Agathon's eminent guests (including Socrates himself) were wise, and Agathon did not demur. Indeed, how many men can we confidently cali wise? But if wisdom is a component of goodness, then what Agathon calls goodness is - along with happiness - a Virtual impossibility for man.</page><page sequence="10">224 THE SIGNIFICANE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM For Agathon's conception of goodness to have any real meaning in broad human terms, his concept of wisdom must be combined with Aristophanes' concept of piety; Agathon's superhuman con- ception of goodness must be coupled with Aristophanes' ali too human conception. Accordingly, thè argument by which Socrates criticises Agathon's depiction of Eros (199c3 ff) leads to10 thè realization that it is not enough to speak of wisdom and ignorance: one must also take account of a third possibility which, though not as high as wisdom, also is opposed to ignorance - right opinion (202a2-9). Obviously, this would include piety, whose precepts are held for true without being founded on reasoning.11 It is therefore in Socrates' speech that both piety and wisdom are comprehended and reconciled, as alternatives. Two ways are given by which man, bora in ignorance, can relate his thoughts to wisdom: one, as we have seen, is by right opinion or piety; the other type of médiation between ignorance and wisdom is philosophy (204a8 f). The latter is the means for those who may be capable of approaching wisdom ; the former is the alternative for those who are not. m Socrates leads up to his speech by separating the essential élément of truth about Eros in Agathon's speech from Agathon's mis- conception of it, and by incorporating that truth into his own speech (199c3ff): Agathon was right in characterizing Eros as concerned with beauty and goodness, but wrong in regarding the latter as its attributes. At the beginning of his speech, in addition to referring again to this dialogue with Agathon, Socrates makes apparent allusions to other speakers. For example, Diotima is said to corne from Mantinea (201d2), a town which Aristophanes had used as an example (193a3).12 Also, like Eryximachus she is described as a fighter of disease (201d3-5), and like Pausanias she is a teacher. These apparent références alert us to the possibility that Socrates' speech may be related to the other speeches as well as to Agathon's. As we shall see, it is related to them in precisely the same way: it separates the élément of truth in each of their portrayals of Eros from a false interprétation and incorporâtes that truth into itself. Since Socrates takes them up one by one, in the course of his own development of the nature of Eros, we shall find that the order in</page><page sequence="11">KENNETH DORTER 225 which he refers to them (Agathon, Eryximachus, Pausanias, Aristophanes, Phaedrus) reflects a progression from thè least to thè most adequate conception of Eros, just as thè order in which they were originally presented formed an ascent in "values," in criteria for praise. According to Agathon, Eros possesses ali thè virtues, as well as beauty. But his proofs are inescapably ludicrous. To show Eros' beauty he argues its tenderness, and as witness to its tenderness he cites a passage from Homer about Atê, drawing an implicit analogy between Eros and Atê (195d2 f). These Homeric Unes (IliadXÏX 92), however, are taken from Agamemnon's speech to Achilles, in which he condemns Atê in generai and in particular as the perpetra- tor of their quarrel over Chryseis. Agathon, indeed, quotes only the beginning of the sentence. The complete sentence reads fitalicizing the phrase omitted by Agathon), "She walks upon the heads of men, harming men." Thus Agathon's speech implicitly réfutes itself by reminding those who are well-versed in Homer (every educated Greek) that love is often the cause of bad and ugly things, and that goodness and beauty cannot, therefore, be its attributes. Moreover, ail his proofs for Eros' virtue (196b6 f) are unsound. It is simply untrue to say that "what a willing person would consent to for a willing person is just." A slave to love might willingly do anything his beloved commands, but this certainly does not mean that he is being treated justly by his beloved. The argument for Eros' tempérance is a paralogismi in the définition of tempérance as "being stronger than pleasures," "strength" means "ability to resist pleasures" ; but the statement "no pleasure is stronger than Eros" means only that Eros is the hardest pleasure to resist. "Strength" is used equivocally in the two premises. And to say that Eros is more courageous than Ares because Aphrodite subdues Ares by means of love is no more convincing, since courage is measured not by conquest but by ability to with- stand pain, an ability nowhere evident in the example. Nor is it a proof of thè wisdom of Eros that it inspires poetry even among non-poets; for the poetry of non-poet lovers is notoriously bad and frequently unwise. Agathon, the esthète, regards Eros as an end in itself and thus tries to assign to it the most désirable attributes, but his attempt is a failure. In the conversation between their Speeches, Socrates dem- onstrates the inadequacy of this conception of Eros and, while agrée-</page><page sequence="12">226 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM ing that it relates to goodness and beauty, maintains that rather than being the embodiment of thèse attributes and an end in itself, Eros is a means to the attainment of them. Agathon's belief that Eros possesses beauty and goodness and is the cause of such qualities in others (197c2-3), together with his assertion that thè object of Eros must also be beautiful (197b5 f), implies that Eros is love of like for like (cf. 195b5). Eryximachus, however, made a contrary assertion: thè noblest Eros is love of opposites (186c5-d7 ff). Eryximachus is thus aware that Eros is love for something other than itself and is therefore not an end in itself but a means, a process of médiation. Mediation is possible in two ways, depending on whether or not one préserves the natures of the things mediated. It can be effected if the natures of the two extremes are compromised so that two things with differing natures resuit in one intermediate nature, as when hot and cold water are mixed, and their natures compromise and alter, producing thè intermediary tepid water. Or, if one préserves the natures of the extremes they may still be mediated by a sort of harmony, as when distinct tones are mediated in the chord that results when they are played simultaneously: the chord com- posed of C and E, for example, does not resemble thè intermediate D; rather, both componente are clearly discernible within the unity. Eryximachus is concerned only with the first type of médiation, which he employs in curing Aristophanes' hiccups by prescribing sneezing. When the sneezing (a violent expulsion of air) is applied to the hiccupping (a violent intake of air) the resuit is a stasis intermediate between the two, not a simultaneous sneeze and hic- cup. His obliviousness to the other type of médiation is evident in his failure to understand Heracleitus - a failure of which he is almost, but not quite, aware (187a4-8). Heracleitus had said (fragment 51): "At variance, it is in accord with itself: there is a backward-stretching harmony like the harmony of a bow and of a lyre." Eryximachus cites this statement, omitting the italicized words, and observes that "it is very unreasonable to say that harmony is at variance, or that it consiste of what is still at vari- ance." He concludes that Heracleitus did not express himself very well and perhaps had meant only that what was originally at variance is subsequently reconciled and brought into agreement, such as when musical notes and mélodies are generated in com- promising the extremes of high and low into determinate pitches. It is, however, dear from the words omitted by Eryximachus that</page><page sequence="13">KENNETH DORTER 227 Heracleitus did not mean merely this, but that there is a simultane- ous agreement and variance in harmony. Eryximachus refuses to accept thè possibility of this kind of médi- ation because it is "unreasonable." As a scientist, he regards dialectical thinking as unintelligible. The dialectical (noetic) tran- scendence of thè logicai (dianoetic) law of contradiction, thè synthesis of thè one with thè many, is répugnant and even ridiculous to him. The référence to Heracleitus indicates thè incompleteness of Eryximachus' position, for Heracleitus was perhaps thè most eloquent champion of a paradoxical, rather than logicai, statement of philosophy. His examples of thè bow and lyre are well suited to raise doubts about thè adequacy of Eryximachus' position, for thè opposing tensions in a bow, between thè force of thè frame and thè opposing force of thè string, may result in an equilibrium, but they do not compromise and cancel each other out. They are preserved in thè equilibrium, and it is precisely this harmony of tension that gives thè bow its power. And thè virtue of a lyre to produce its sound is possible only because of a similar equilibrium, or harmony of tension, between thè unyielding frame and thè tautness of thè strings. Eryximachus' failure to recognize any sort of médiation other than compromise leads to a remarkable conclusion. He claims that it is a virtue of Eros to mediate and form a communion between man and thè gods (188dl, 8-9). But in view of his blindness to and déniai of any sort of médiation other than compromise, what he has in mind here must be some sort of merging of thè human and divine: thè knowledge and power with which science furnishes man both exalts man and subverts religion - powers once thought to be divine and incompréhensible are made accessible to man, on one hand, and, on thè other, man, who once considered himself helpless and dépendent, becomes master of thè universe. The religious conception of thè relationship between thè human and divine is re- placed by thè scientific conception of man with godlike knowledge and power. Indeed, Eryximachus shows us how this is possible: thè fundamental force of all nature is said to be Eros (186a3-b2, 188d4), and Eros, we are told, can be mastered and controlied by human science (186c5-e3); thus man has control and mastery over ali nature. Eryximachus is thus like his teacher, Empedocles, who maintained that science would give man control not only over sickness and old âge, but also over thè weather and even over life anddeath(fr. 111).</page><page sequence="14">228 THE SIGNinCANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM If compromise were the only médiation conceivable, classical philosophy must be confessed impossible, since the exaltation of man would be at the price of the divinity of the divine. Not wisdom, but only scientific knowledge would be the alternative to ignorance, if the "divine" truth were commensurate with man rather than in a realm apart. Accordingly, the incompleteness in Eryximachus' conception of médiation and its conséquences is implicitly criticised in Socrates' speech. Socrates (through Diotima) repeats Eryximachus' claim that Eros médiates and forms a communion between man and the gods (202d8 f ), but just prior to that, continuing thè line of reasoning with which he had just refuted Agathon, he observes that the médiation between two extremes is itself distinct and différent from both extremes (201e8 f). Eros, therefore, mediating between the human and divine, can itself be neither human nor divine, but must rather be daimonic (202d8 f ). Socrates proceeds to show the pos- sibility of this alternative kind of médiation by Eros: "Being in the middle of both [gods and men], it fills them up so as to bind the whole together with itself. . . . And a god does not mingle with a man, but through this exists ail the communion and dialogue of gods towards man" (202e6-203a3). This "logicai" metaphor establishes Heracleitus' paradox on an apparently less elusive footing by showing how the divine and human can mingle in harmony while remaining apart and discrete; and in this concept of the "daimonic" (202dl3), the metaphor exhibits the basis of the possibility of meta- physical philosophy. Like Eryximachus, Pausanias recognises that Eros is love for what is différent from oneself, for what one does not possess. But he also realizes what Eryximachus denied, that Eros is not a mere equaliza- tion of the différences which éliminâtes them. Rather, he regards Eros as a means ofattaining the other: the integrity of the opposites is preserved. The produci of Eros is not equalization but "friend- ship" (182cl f). We saw earlier that for the lover the noble or beautiful goal is to win the beloved, and for the beloved it is to attain virtue. In both cases the means to this end, the nature of the erotic relationship itself, is the same : the willingness to behave basely and sacrilegiously and "to undergo a slavish slavery such as no slave ever would" (182d8-183b7, 184b6-185b3) - actions which, as Pausanias notes, would be condemned as base for any ends other than those of either séduction or virtue. The end justifies the means.</page><page sequence="15">KENNETH DORTER 229 This principle conflicts with thè principle to which he has been paying lip service throughout his speech: that Eros in itself is neither noble nor base - thè "Uranic" species is noble and thè "Pandemie" base - but its nobility or baseness dépends only on thè manner in which thè lovers conduet themselves (180e4-182a6, 183d4-6). His whole speech suggests that he believes thè end justifies thè means, but - perhaps to mask thè unsavoriness of his position - he pays lip service to thè contrary principle that conduet alone détermines thè worth of thè activity. For it is generally maintained that no intrinsically worthy goal would require base actions for its fulfillment, that thè means must be commensurate with thè end. Pausanias himself inadvertently gives us thè best illustration of thè truth of this when he says that, for thè sake of becoming virtuous, a beloved youth ought to be willing to indulge in actions which, for any other end, would be considered most base and shameful (182e-183b). It is inconceivable that thè habituai performance of base actions should in any way be conducive to virtue, since virtue is inséparable from one's actions and is en- gendered only as a habit. As confirmation of his position, Pausanias argued that no matter how basely and slavishly a lover behaves, his friends will feel no shame for him, and his enemies no reproach, since he is acting out of love. We hâve only to picture this situation to see how wrong Pausanias' prédiction is, and how unjustified is his whole position. If Eros seeks something good, its nature must be commensurate with such a goal. After Socrates, in thè course of his speech, emends Eryximachus' characterization of Eros, he proceeds to revise Pausanias' charac- terization accordingly. Pausanias had claimed that thè aims of an erotic relationship are both beauty and goodness (181d7-e3, 182d5f, 184d5-7), and that thè lover contrives in ali possible ways to attain his end: he is so slavish that he sleeps on doorsteps (183a6-7) and forswears himself before thè gods (183b6-7). Socrates' description of Eros parallele Pausanias', but with significant changes. Since its father is Resource, Socrates' Eros, like Pausanias', contrives to possess what is beautiful and good (203c5, d4-5). And since its mother is Poverty, Socrates' Eros, like Pausanias', must sleep outside and on doorsteps (203d2). But Socrates portrays Eros' sleeping on doorsteps as due to poverty, not slavishness, and although in contriving to win its object it is wily and even sophistic (203d8), it is never base nor blasphemous. The distinctions are subtle, but significant: in Socrates' speech Pausanias' Eros is no longer ignoble.</page><page sequence="16">230 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM Thus, whereas Pausanias' Statement that Eros is noble only if nobly conducted is inconsistent with his daim that success justifies any behavior, Socrates effects a reconciliation by making the means (Eros) commensurate with the end (the beautiful and good). Aristophanes, like Pausanias, realizes that Eros is love for an end other than itself, which the lover seeks to attain without cancelling their différences, but he also realizes that the means must be commensurate with thè end. Man may attain what is truly good only as a gift from thè gods, and he must earn this gift as a reward for his goodness and piety. For Aristophanes thè ultimate end at which Eros aims is re-unifi- cation with one's other half. Το dramatize this point, Aristophanes claims that if Hephaestus were to ask a pair of lovers, when they were lying together, whether they would like him to bind and weld them together so that rather than two individuals they would be one, no one would refuse (192d2 f). But why does Piato have Aristophanes assign this rôle to Hephaestus? Would not Apollo or Zeus, who effected the originai séparation (190e2f), be the obvious choices? Plato's introduction of Hephaestus is, in fact, rather suggestive. In the Odyssey (Vili 266 ff ) the story is told that Hephaestus, having been informed that his wife, Aphrodite, was making love to Ares, punished them by causing them to be inextrica- bly bound together when they were together in bed. Not only did they not consider this the consummation of their erotic ambition, they were extremely anxious to be set free. Apart from the fact that Homer seems to disagree with his fellow poet's view of the goal of Eros, we may reflect that most people would not be likely to regard the permanent physical union of which Aristophanes speaks, as the fulfillment of the desires of love. Nor did it seem likely to Dante when he devised the punishment for Francesca da Rimina and her lover Paolo {Inferno V 73 ff ). Certainly Aristophanes is wrong in asserting that "No one would refuse." What then is the object of Eros, if not this? In Socrates' speech, after the emendation of Pausanias' depiction of Eros, Diotima says: There is a certain account that they seek half of themselves, these lovers; but my account states that Eros is neither of the half nor of the whole if it does not happen, my friend, to be good, since men wish to amputate both their feet and hands, if they appear to them to be in a bad way (205dl0-e5). Whereas according to Aristophanes Eros is desire for the compie-</page><page sequence="17">KENNETH DORTER 23 1 tion of what one is, according to Socrates it is thè desire for some- thing beyond and independent of oneself : thè good (cf. 205e7- 206a7), which is sufficiently beyond and distinct from one's own nature that one would willingly become incomplete by amputating a limb without which one would be better off. It is in Phaedrus' position alone, thè last to be incorporated in- to Socrates' speech, that this self-transcendent aspect of Eros is conceived, and thè possibility is raised of something higher than life - something for which one might sacrifice one's life: "And, in- deed, to die for another, only lovers wish to do, and not only men, but also women" (179b4-5). Phaedrus himself , however, makes evident thè inadequacy of his own conception of thè transcendent character of Eros. Although he had just said that only lovers die for another, he almost immediately réfutes this by recounting Achilles' self-sacrifice for Patroclus (179el-180a4), and by maintaining that Achilles was not a lover but a beloved (180a4-7). Achilles did not sacrifice himself out of love (eros) but only out of affection (agapê) (180b2). But since the lover is divinely inspired and therefore does not deserve as much personal crédit for his action as does the beloved, who is brave and noble of his own free will, the gods honor the beloved who sacrifices himself more than the lover who does so (180a7-b5). If Phaedrus were right, thè self-transcendent power of Eros would furnish man with no power he did not hâve without it, since the unerotic beloved is also capable of self-transcendence and is even more praiseworthy. In his own speech, therefore, after his criticism of Aristophanes, Socrates contradicts Phaedrus' interprétation of the stories of Alcestis and of Achilles (179b6-180b5). They sac- rificed themselves not for the lover or the beloved, but for immortal glory: ultimately the object of love is immortality (208cl-el). In criticising Aristophanes' speech, Socrates had argued that the goal of Eros is the good. He went on to say that it is thè eternai possession of the good (206all-2), and thus thè goal of Eros is not only the good, but immortality as well (207al-4). Not only might one sacrifice parts of one's body which hâve gone bad in order to achieve a better condition, one might also sacrifice one's life to achieve immortality - an achievement made possible, according to this account, only by Eros. Socrates proceeds to elaborate the concept of immortality and its various forms, and then présents the famed account of "The Ascent to Beauty" (210al f). This is the specifically original contribution of</page><page sequence="18">232 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM Socrates' speech, no longer a critique and development of the preceding speeches. IV Alcibiades' speech must be considered apart from the others, as it is distinguished from them not only in that he was not part of the original arrangement, but also in that the topic (Socrates) of his encomium is différent from that of thè others' (Eros). He makes this change, he tells us, because Socrates would be jeal- ous if Alcibiades praised a god or man other than him (214d2-4). Socrates is thus portrayed as hybristic enough (cf. 175e7) to compete in some sensé with the gods. Accordingly, Alcibiades compares him to Marsyas (215b3 f), a demi-god, on thè ground that he is too high to be compared to any other man (221c4-d6), and describes him as having divine images within him (215b3, 216e5-6, 222a3). He similarly attributes to Socrates (215c3-6 f, 222al-6) the power of médiation, which Socrates had called the province of the daimonic, and calls him a "godsend" (hermaion, 217a3). Socrates is, in a word, a "daimonic man" (219cl). One effect of Alcibiades' speech is thus to liken Socrates to Eros, both by substituting Socrates for Eros as the subject of his encomi- um and by portraying Socrates - as Socrates had portrayed Eros - as daimonic. This likeness is drawn in other ways as well. For example, Alcibiades ascribes to Socrates the same virtues that the first five speakers had attributed to Eros: courage (220d5f)&gt; justice (218d6 f, 220 e2-7), tempérance (216d6-7 ff), piety (220d4-5). As for wisdom, this was the only virtue which Socrates insisted does not pertain to Eros (203e5-204b5): Eros, being a daimon, is in between wisdom and ignorance; he is not wise, but is instead a philosopher. Similarly, Alcibiades does not cali Socrates wise, but does cali him a philosopher (218b3). In addition, Alcibiades helps attribute to Socrates the maternai and paternal attributes that Socrates had assigned to Eros. Socrates had said (203c7-dl) that because its mother was Poverty, Eros is "hard and dusty and shoeless and homeless" (the rest of the description is an amplification of "homeless"). From Aristodemus we learned that Socrates, too, is usually dusty and shoeless (174a3- 4), and Socrates himself mentioned his (figurative) homelessness (198b7-cl). Alcibiades' speech, a tribute to Socrates' hardness, thus rounds out Socrates' likeness to Eros' maternai side. Socrates had</page><page sequence="19">KENNETH DORTER 233 also said that Eros, because its father was Resource, plots to obtain beautiful and good things (203d4-5); this too, as well as Eros' other pateraal attributes (203d5 f), is ascribed to Socrates by Alcibiades (223a3-9). For reasons perhaps connected in part with relation between wisdom and piety, Socrates had chosen to présent his account of the nature of Eros in religious imagery rather than philosophical concepts, and had depicted Eros as a demi-god or daimon. Alcibi- ades, however, by substituting Socrates for Eros, and portraying Socrates in the terms used to describe Eros, shows how what Socrates had called divine and had presented religiously can be seen in human (philosophical) terms. Man's link with the divine may be seen as within man himself , not requiring the literal interven- tion of other beings. The description of Socrates as "daimonic" may remind us, for example, of the daimonion which Socrates daims to have within him. If man has présent to himself the daimonic, the realm mediating between the human and divine, then the attainment of the highest things is open to man independently of religion. Just as Alcibiades replaces the divine (Eros) with what is highest in man (Socrates), his speech implies that, for some, religion might be replaced by philosophy (cf. 218a2-b7). Perhaps it is significant that the prayer of Socrates, which Alcibiades reports (220d4-5), was addressed not to an Olympian but to the sun - a being whose significance for Socrates is at least as much philosophical as religious.13 NOTES 1 A noteworthy exception is Platcfs Symposium by Stanley Rosen (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1968) to whom the présent interprétation is in- debted, particularly for the insight that each speech implies its own réfutation. 2 The daims that Socrates replies to each of the preceding speeches and that there are, therefore, two sequential Orders, based on distinct principles, constitutes the main thesis of this essay. So far as I know, it has not previously been observed that the first part of Socrates' speech contains replies to his predecessors, and consequently this line of interprétation has not, I think, hitherto been explored. 8 Thus, the link between beauty and goodness, made explicit in Socrates' speech (204el 0, is prefigured in the structure of the dialogue itself . 4 Cf. Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, ΠΙ 7. 5 Any attempt to take an intermediate position requires bnnging together both Standpoints and, since they are inconsistent with one another, results in an equivocai notion of goodness. Thus, if goodness meant the self-interest of a particular group or class of people, thè members must (by définition) treat</page><page sequence="20">234 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPEECHES IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM one another unselfishly and are thus recognizing a good other than selfishness. "Enlightened" self-interest is no longer selfish in the strict sensé. In the strict sensé, selfishness means seeking one' s own advantage without regard to the implications for others; but "enlightened" self-interest means that selfishness eventually discovers that it is in its interest to be concerned with others. In Hegelian terms, selfishness is essentially unstable and develops its own négation. That is why, for example, "knowledge is virtue." 6 Instead of wisdom. For Eryximachus, the scientist, it is episteme, not sophiat that reveals "the truth" (cf. 176c7) about things. 7 The unimpressive Cephalus seems to be an example of the sort of person for whom thèse are paramount concerns (Republic, 1 329a-331b). 8 Eryximachus, as his predecessors, had equated them (186b4-c4); Aris- tophanes did not mention beauty. 9 E.g., Meno, 78c: Republic, 427e f; Laws, 631d: cf. Protagoras, 349b. 10 Since Socrates' correction of Agathon's view of virtue follows from his correction of Agathon's view of Eros, it is in this passage that the two thèmes of the Symposium - the présentation of a criterion of goodness and a conception of Eros- find their connection. 11 Thus thè term dogma is akin to doxa. 12 See The Symposium by Piato, translated by W. Hamilton (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1951), note 20, p. 1 19. 18 E.g., Republic, 506e-516b.</page></plain_text>
