<plain_text><page sequence="1">TEKSTSTUDIE THE THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTION IN DE MUNDO AND THE RELATION BETWEEN THIS WRITING AND THE WORK OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE by A. P. BOS (Amsterdam) INTRODUCTION*. Today the discussion concerning De Mundo, a work handed down as part of the Corpus Aristotelicum, has led to a virtually unanimous rejection of the possibility that Aristotle himself wrote this brief piece. The work has received relatively much attention, and compared to various other small parts of the Corpus it has been analyzed and commented upon to great depth. But it appears to me that rather too much attention has been directed to all sorts of admittedly important details, at the expense of sufficient consideration of the core of the philosophical view presented in it 1. I believe that this core is to be found in the philosophical theology of chapter six, and that the discussion of De Mundo would profit from further analysis of that theological system. Its basic thrust should be searched out and then possible relations should be tracked down to other known philosophical systems in which god functions as the final arche of the entire Physis. Such investigation should not be prejudiced ; I believe that even the consensus against its authenticity as an Aristotelian work should be bracketed, and all philosophers after Diogenes of Apollonia and Anaxagoras - every thinker, that is, involved in the shift from PAj/j/j-philosophy to P^jj/j-theology - should be taken into account. Undoubtedly, De Mundo was meant to be read as having come from Aristotle's own hand. To be sure, J. Bernays and others have defended the thesis that its being * I should like to express my gratitude to Professor G. J. de Vries, Professor J. Mansfeld, and Professor D. M.

The person to whom the work was dedicated, or to whom as letter it was addressed (authentically or no) can hardly be anyone other than Alexander of Macedón who, while still crown prince, for a time received instruction from Aristotle. As we know, Aristotle had lived in Athens until Plato's death in 347 BC, and in the course of those twenty years established a reputation as philosopher and scientist within the Academy. He then left the city to spend many years in Asia Minor and northern Greece. To the datum that De Mundo purports to be a work by Aristotle and contains a philosophical theology of a particular character, one must add the circumstance that scholarship is confronted with exceptional difficulties when it comes to the Stagirite's philosophical theology. In the traditional Aristotelian theology of Metaphysica /' god is indeed presented as pure mind, but no direct relation is laid between divine thought and the Physis. Concerning the theology of the earlier Aristotle there are a) those who hold that it was not substantially different from that of Metaphysica /' 3, while b) others were of the opinion that the notion of a transcendent, unmoved mover was worked out much later ; originally Aristotle remained much closer to Plato, relating all physical motion to an origin which was in turn supposedly characterized by self- motion. According to them, in this early phase Aristotle pictured god as an aspect, the „inner side" or soul of the divine, heavenly element, the aether. 4 The first-mentioned group has great difficulty explaining the development from the late-Platonic theology to a doctrine of the divine unmoved mover ; Plato's post-Phaedo thought can certainly be said to be ruled by the attempt to explain Physis as a whole in terms of divine thought, pictured in the Timaeus as divine contemplation of the intelligible model. When this is admitted one is confronted with the question as to how it is possible that Aristotle also identifies god as the most fundamental Arche for Physis, and also has this god qualified by purely contemplative activity, while nevertheless every positive 2.

The second group of commentators can pride itself on having narrowed the gap between Plato and Aristotle on this point. But all too often its representatives have failed to demonstrate sufficiently convincingly the philosophical inevitability of Aristotle's development from the postulated aether theology to the conception found in Metaphysica f' . In view of this important issue I would analyse the theological conception of De Mundo in order to determine its philosophical relation to the late-Platonic and traditional Aristotelian views. There is sufficient warrant to do so even if only because the occurrence of a certain philosophical theme in De Mundo does not beforehand exclude its being Aristotelian, not even if the work as a whole should indeed have to be assigned a later date. Nowadays few authors would deny the significant Peripatetic influence evident in the work. D. J. Furley even described it as an intentional falsification for which its author has mainly drawn upon Aristotle's exoteric writings. 5 I mentioned a need for open-mindedness with respect to the work. To render this still more plausible I would point out that the scholarly unanimity regarding De Mundo is itself relative. It can be shown that this unanimity is not uni-vocal. One cannot even speak of harmony-in-discord. On the contrary, the theme of the inauthenticity of De Mundo is sung in many keys at once. Although I would focus the actual discussion on the theology of De Mundo, I will first comment briefly on current discussions of the work, and show some of the differences in viewpoint that have arisen regarding the dating and characterization of it 6. 5.

The discussions of De Mundo' s authenticity display a number of peculiarities. The fate of De Mundo is shared by other writings in the Corpus that were branded „pseudepigrapha" as well. In some cases that judgment was later revised because there seemed room for them once the idea of development in Aristotle's thought had gained prominence. One can recall in this connection De Motu Animalium, rehabilitated by Werner Jaeger ; 7 and one may also think of the Categoriae, concerning which H. J. Krämer has recently noted that today, after a century of intensive discussion, a significant measure of agreement as to its authenticity has been reached once again. 8 It is usually admitted further that a profound evolution must have taken place in Aristotle's thought between the time when he designed the Categoriae, in which he assigned ontological priority to concrete things, and the phase of the Metaphyska with its center of gravity in the Form-aspect of things. Less convincing sofar has been F. Dirlmeier's attempt to reclaim for Aristotle the Magna Moralia. 9 But the shift in his view has not failed to impress. The authenticity of the Ethica Eudemia is not now doubted by anyone, even though such doubt was common enough during the nineteenth century. One could think also of what befell the fragments of the so-called „exoteric writings" declared inauthentic by their first editor, V. Rose, but at present highly interesting to scholars, because they are thought to contain hints of the early Aristotelian position. Any pronouncement of a judgment regarding authenticity or inauthenticity must be seen in this light. This is certainly the case in an evaluation of De Mundo ; the ancients seldom doubted that Aristotle himself was its author. Apparently Proclus was the first who was unwilling to subscribe to Aristotle's authorship of the work. 10 In the sixteenth century Erasmus and Melanchton rejected its authenticity. It was under heavy attack during the critical nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. As long as the Metaphyska was considered to be representative par excellence for Aristotle's philosophy, it was naturally impossible to leave room for the vastly different view expressed in De Mundo. 7.

In connection with this text one can note that Proclus was aware of a discrepancy between the view of De Mundo and that of Aristotle's Metaphysica, and therefore questions the authenticity of De Mundos tradition, but does no (yet) conclude to the inauthenticity of the work itself. Cf. Proclus, op. cit. I. 37 D and 93 D (Diehl).</page><page sequence="5">318 A. P. BOS The possibility for this could arise only after Jaeger's book on the development of Aristotle's thought (1923), in which he tried to show that Aristotle, during die course of the forty-five years of his academic career had successively defended at least three distinct philosophical views. Jaeger's book won many scholars for a more historical approach to Aristotle's thought. But the results of the various efforts made to subdivide Aristotle's development into phases have turned out contradictory to the degree that in reaction the significance of a problem-historical method is now often denied. Thus it is that no attempt has been made until now to investigate seriously the possibility that Jaeger's new approach may perhaps be a fruitful one in the case of De Mundo. It is remarkable, however, that the only point on which scholars are pretty well agreed is the claim of inauthenticity itself. As soon as it comes to fixing the date at which the work must have been written, or when the philosophical position of the author is being determined, or the arguments that would count against authenticity are considered, a great divergence of opinion appears. One author has even been known to suggest two different dates. ai The dates suggested by those who consider De Mundo to be post-Aristotelian span some centuries. It is noteworthy that the earliest dating is defended in one of the more recent publications. W. Capelle placed the work in the first half of the second century. 12 Again Capelle, 13 J. Maguire, 14 A. J. Festugière, 15 H. Diels, 16 E. Zeller, 17 W. L. Lorimer, 18 H. Strohm19 mention dates in the first century. D. J. Furley holds that the work must stem from before the birth of Christ, about 50 B.C., but before the edition of Aristotle's esoteric writing? by Andronicus of Rhodes became widely known. 20 Until recently P. Gohlke was the only modern author willing to defend an earlier date still - approximately 330 B.C. 21 But his view 11. W. Capelle in 1905 and 1907. The difference is not explained. 12. W.

Above I noted that, with regard to the Categoriae things have taken a turn favorable to Gohlke). On p. 166 he calls De Mundo the work of Aristotle „in dem er seine tiefsten Gedanken ausgesprochen hat." Compare his 1936-article, p. 355, in which he takes as terminus post quern 327 B.C.

Strohm in 1970 22. It seems at least remarkable that the present writer began his study of the problem of De Mundo's inauthenticity a few years ago, suspecting that this inauthenticity was insufficiently supported, and that meanwhile in Italy G. Reale (1974) completed his new commentary in which he spiritedly defended the thesis that De Mundo is genuine and of great importance for our understanding of Aristotle's thought. One may conclude that the time is ripe, if not for the acceptance of the authenticity of the work, at least for a renewed critical evaluation of the studies published to date. The quality and content of De Mundo are subject to judgments similarly diverse. W. Capelle espied a typical example of late-Hellenistic „Popularphilosophie" 23 here, and had a dim view of its author's philosophical ability. 24 According to Capelle he strung his work together mostly with excerpts from the Stoic Posidonius, and meant to bridge the gap between the Peripatetic tradition and the Stoics. 2ß J. Maguire left few of Capelle's results unscathed. According to him De Mundo contains practically no firmly demonstrable derivations from Posidonius. 26 Pan-posidonianism, which exercised a strong influence on Capelle, Maguire believes, is a dead-end. 27 To him De Mundo is much rather aimed against Stoicism, and should, in view of the writings of Ps. Philolaus, Ocellus, Ps. Ecphantus and Onatas, be understood as a neo-Pythagorean product. 28 On various counts Festugière arrives at results similar to those of Capelle. He too emphasizes the rhetorical character of the work29 and characterizes it as a typical example of Hellenistic dogmatic eclecticism. 80 H. Strohm, on the other hand, sharply combats talk of superficiality and lack of profundity in his 1952 article and denies it in the commentary published by him as well. 31 This writer finds that De 22.

I do not deny that Gohlke's work suffers from gaps and errors, but at the same time this author also often exhibits a keen intuition in philosophical problems. Compare the judgment of P. Louis, Rev. de Philologie 30 (1956), 109-110. 23. W. Capelle, art. cit. (1905), 566; id. (1907), 55. 24. Art. cit. fl905), 537 : „philosophische Unwissenheit". 25. ibid., 533 ;cf. also op. cit.

Effe, Studien zur Kosmologie und Theologie der Aristotelischen Schrift über die Philosophie (Zetemata 50) ; München 1970, 61 holds that Ocellus often makes use of Aristotelian data, to the extent that Effe even regards part of his work as a fragment of the dialogue De Philosophia. 29.

But the work belongs primarily to the Platonic tradition. 32 Thus in succession we meet Stoic, neo-Pythagorean, and Platonic characterizations of the work. Over against these D. J. Furley brought forward the Peripatetic nature of the philosophical conception of De Mundo. In his opinion it intentionally harks back to Aristotle, though specifically to the exoteric Aristotle. 33 To be sure, the writer of De Mundo has taken great liberties in including all sorts of non- Aristotelian material. 34 It may be that in the case of a superficial piece authored by some unknown writer one could rest content with such contradictory judgments. It seems to me that intensive study of De Mundo, however, certainly does not leave one with an impression of triviality. Intelligibility and lucidity do not necessarily spell lack of depth. In the case of a serious philosophical work one ought to search for the basic theme of the argument and characterize the work on that basis. If an immaterial, intelligible reality is its theme the work may be called „Platonic," even if in addition Pythagorean, Stoic or Aristotelian tendencies are recognizable. When all of reality is reduced to its numerical or spatial aspect one wil speak of a „Pythagorean" work. A work should be called „Stoic" only when all that truly is, is seen as material, unless it should be supposed that this basic theme holds not only for Stoicism, but also for other views, such as the early Aristotelian philosophy. If such be the case a closer specification will have to be attempted. In a later article I will return to the mutually disagreeing views modern interpreters defend concerning a number of details in De Mundo. First, however, I will investigate more closely the view of the divine and its relation to Nature as presented especially in chapter six. GOD AND THE COSMOS IN DE MUNDO CHAPTER SIX. In the sixth chapter of De Mundo the author begins with a reference to the ancient wisdom that all things in reality depend on god's preserving influence. 35 God is „supreme in the cosmos." 36 This statement is of some importance. One would be inclined to make a comparison with the discussion concerning the well-known passage in Plato's Respublica, in which the idea of the Good is referred to as 32. Art. cit. (1952), 175. Note the remarkable characterization on p. 174: „ein Philosoph der im Namen des Aristoteles spricht, [aber] aus dem Meister nur das Platonische herausliest." Op. cit., 268 and 278. 33. Op. at. (1955), 337-339. It is amusing to compare Furley s position with that of Theodor Bergk, Rhein. Museum, 1882, 52, whose thesis was that the work could not possibly be an intentional forgery, for in that case the author would have adopted Aristotle's style - of which there is not a trace ! Furley's view is accepted by I. During, „Aristoteles" ; P.W.-R.E., Suppl. Bd. XI, (1968), col. 313. 34. Op. cit. (1955), 335. 35. 397bl5. 36. 397b 13 to xov xóopov xvQicozatov. Compare also the complaint in c. 1. directed against unphilosophical folk : they neglect matters of the greatest importance, „to wit, the cosmos and that which in the cosmos is the highest." 391a25.</page><page sequence="8">THE THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTION IN DE MUNDO 321 xov ovxoç xò qavótatov - interpreted by Mrs. C. J. de Vogel the sense that the Idea of the Good need not be counted among to ôv. 37 Similarly Capelle tried to interpret the sixth chapter of De Mundo as showing that god is apart from the cosmos. To him it seems that this chapter „polemicizes sharply against the Stoic immanence of god, and unceasingly emphasÍ2es the transcendence of god, who is enthroned in sublime tranquility beyond the stars." 38 On the basis of the text in which god is referred to as „what is most important of the cosmos," H. Strohm has correctly opposed that sort of picture. 39 De Mundo's godhead can neither be characterized as immanent in the Stoic sense of „permeating the whole cosmos," nor as transcendent. To him should be ascribed merely highest „supremacy." 40 God is the „first citizen" of the cosmo-polis, just as also the Persian king, in splendid isolation within his high palace-walls, nevertheless lives within the Persian realm. There is a distinction but no separation between god and cosmos similar to the case of the general and his army, the helmsman and his ship, the leader and his chorus. „Control from afar" to a Greek in antiquity can mean nothing other than „control via intermediaries," 41 and certainly not a kind of „remote control" without any connecting link. Once the separation of god and cosmos is carried through radically, as it seems to be in Metaphysica /', there is no longer any trace of active „control" on the part of the divinity. God is supreme in the cosmos, just as to the Greek mind the center is most important (the arche) to the circle. A good cosmology cannot avoid theology. But the author immediately adds that one must think in terms of a „phased" dependence, to the extent that god calls things into being and preserves them indirectly, via „mediation." Just as the human intellect makes use of the senses and parts of the body as instruments, so also god has his instruments wherewith he executes his divine counsel. He is not avrovgyóç, 42 does not „dirty his hands," for this would be unfitting for a god of (intellectual) standing.43 (One may well wonder what „unfitting" could mean here. If one pictures god as acting in a concrete, practical way one apparently infringes certain norms. But these norms are derived from nothing 37. „Encore une fois : le Bien dans la République de Platon" ; Zetesis, Album amicorum presented to E. de Strijcker ; Antwerp 1973, 53.

BOS other than the concept of god itself. And that concept as such is „subject to" the norms that hold for thought, specifically the norms of identity with itself and non-identity with everything that is distinguishable from it. Just as the dogma of the „immutability of god," his being „one" and non-anthropomorphic are derived from these logical norms by most Greek philosophers, so also in De Mundo the dogma of „non- intervention" in concreto natural reality on the part of the divinity. The author appeals to the laws of logic, to which human thought is subject - laws whose basic rules, since they were recognized by Parmenides, have been taken as the starting point for reflection on the divine in every philosophical theology. In all this there is no recognition of the fact that the procedure of starting with an empty concept - such as the term „god" necessarily is as long as all revelation is rejected - and then seeking to give it substance through logical operations is a false one. With his power De Mundo1 s god controls even that which is most remote from him. 44 It is certainly true that Stoicism took a different route insofar as it taught that the divine is actually present and operative in all of Physis, 45 But it is good to remember also that a philosophical theme is used here which Plato in the Sophistes (247d ff.), introduced in a context in which he connects the re-ality of true being with act-uality (cf. 265b ff. and C. J. de Vogel, Philosophia I, Assen 1970, 182). The fascinating thing in the view presented in De Mundo is that here is developed an idea of decreasing order and orderliness in Physis. That theme suggests a remarkable affinity with the Platonic notion of a decrease of Being in proportion to the distance from the Origin (the Fullness of Being). But there is also a sharp contrast with the late- Platonic ontology. In that ontology the existence and orderliness of material reality (soma) is derived from a higher, non-material psychical reality (psyche), which in turn owes its being and perfection to a reality of a higher order still, the non-material and non-spatial world of thought. In De Mundo there is, however, no mention of a systematic deduction of these lower orders of being from the highest via analogy, such as Plato undertook in his dialogues from the time after the Respublica. From his very earliest period Aristotle brought forward serious criticism against such attempts on the part of Plato and pointed to the metabasis eis allo genos involved here, since no justice is done to the proper nature of, for instance, the physical soma. 46 Aristotle rejected the world of immaterial ideas as ground of being and model for physical reality. He does not begin with a radical division of being into a physical and a meta-physical domain as Plato did in Timaeus 27d-28c. For him there is only a distinction between a divine part and a non-divine part of the one, somatically qualified Physis. In his early phase - which I would characterize as „physicalistic" - a derivation of Physis from meta-physical principia would be inconceivable. Aristotle's rejection of 44. 397b23. 45. Thus H.

The text is silent about âocójuata and an intelligible world. There is, however, a sharp distinction between a non-divine and a divine part (the aether) of Physics, parallel to a distinction between soma and immaterial psyche in the cosmos according to the Timaeus. Furthermore, there is a decrease of the effect of the divine dynamis to the measure that it approaches the spatial center of the cosmos. The relative disorder of earthly reality is explained by the distance from the highest divinity, the origin of the dynamis 51 (and the axiological center of the cosmos). Rephrasing Aristotle's critique of Plato from De Cáelo I, c. 1 52 one could say : „it is logically necessary that the dynamis lessens to the degree that it moves away (from its origin)." At issue is not a contrast between an area in which order is readily seen, and another in which order, though present, is not manifest. This is what the Stoics posit, who cannot accept any difference in degree of orderedness, since, according to them, the divine actually penetrates the entire cosmos. De Mundo's author avoids the implications of such a view - god could then be found even among the refuse-heaps in the slums. 53. That is why he makes an extremely important distinction between god's being and his operation. 54 The throne of god is in the heavens, „the home of the gods," but his power is manifest throughout the cosmos, even if in lessening degrees. Following Homer, the writer refers to the place of god as „on the loftiest crest" 85 of the entire globe, the very place which in Plato's Phaedrus 247b was identified as the window towards the intelligible world. Entirely in agreement with this location is god's function as the „keystone" in the vault of the physical order. 56 47. Cf. D. J. Allan, The Philosophy of Aristotle ; Oxford 19702, VI. J.

BOS God, then, is the governing and legislative center of Physis, but he delegates the execution of his counsel to his subordinates, i.e. primarily to the celestial gods who are most near to him and consequently evince greater effect of the divine power than does anything less close. 57 In this connection comparisons of god with human captains, leaders and magistrates S8 are quite appropriate. Fragments from De Philosophia prove such comparisons not to be foreign to Aristotle. Equally appropriate is the detailed analogy between, on the one hand, god and physis and, on the other hand, the Persian „great kings" and their vast realm, including its hierarchical governmental structure. 59 This metaphor is particularly interesting because, next to the notion of a „graded" providence and ordering of reality already introduced, it also implies the theme of a „graded" intelligence network. In his palace the Persian king receives intelligence concerning everything that occurs within the realm via the central nervous system of his signal- beacon service. Similarly, the divinity has no direct knowledge of all that passes in Physis ; he knows indirectly and generally. 60 In that sense this god, as in De Philosophia fr. 12 (Ross), may be called èmoxrjpovixcòraxoç. 61 GOD AND THE HEAVENLY ELEMENT IN DE MUNDO. This exalted divinity seated in the most lofty place, we are told, by means of his dynamis causes sun and moon and all the heavens to proceed along circular paths, and through it he also preserves everything on earth. 62 In c. 2 the aether as independent ousia is treated in a way reminiscent of the well-known passage of De Cáelo I, c. 2 and c. 3. But while in De Cáelo I, 2 it is said that the circular path is proper to the heavenly element „by nature," we now find that it derives from the power of god. 63 A parallel problem exists concerning the relation of De Cáelo I, 2 with regard to the 57.

His conclusion that the image of the Persian king and his servants must derive from the eastern Jewish world of thought does not at all seem „unabweisbar" to me. The image presupposes a typically philosophical systematics, in which levels of knowledge are assumed : a) experience presupposing contact with the concrete object (touch, taste), b) experience with a distantiation with respect to the object (seeing, hearing), c) abstract, purely „theoretical" knowledge which is not based on the senses. To the early Greek philosopher Xenophanes god was still „nothing but seeing, nothing but thinking, nothing but hearing." (D.K. 21B24). The subsequent purification of the philosophical concept of god retains for the „highest divinity" only pure "voiiv" To ta ovgávia then are ascribed the faculties of „sight" and „hearing". Cf. Arist. De Philosophia 24 (Ross). If one would explain the „go-betweens" in terms of eastern culture, one would have to follow J.

His perspective will be broadened later when, on the wings of philosophy he raises himself to the „Archimedean point" from which he will be able to contemplate both Physis and its Origin. In any case, an analysis of the relation of god to the aether in De Mundo c. 6 is indicated. A prefatory remark must be made concerning the fundamental difference between the theology of De Mundo c. 6 and Metaphysica /', c. 7 and c. 9. In the latter an actio ad extra on the part of god is entirely absent, while in De Mundo much imagery is used for the very purpose of showing that such actio or impetus or influxus upon reality-outside-of-god (in a strict sense : the aether too is „divine" 392a9) certainly obtains. The sequel will show that next to this difference there are important areas of agreement between the views of De Mundo and Metaphysica /' as well. As noted earlier, god is localized on „the top of the celestial arch" ; „in the loftiest place." 66 It is Strohm who with great emphasis has pointed out that this is not merely popular myth. He rightly remarks that already in De Philosophia (book III) a philosophical theology concerning the avœ xònoq must have been present, against the background of Academic views regarding the divinity of the astral world. 67 I believe that this datum is of great significance for the interpretation of De Mundo1 s theological conception, and a closer analysis of it is likely to help us further. In this connection I take the liberty of an excursion to Clement of Alexandria. Qement, in his Protrepticus appealing to Greek philosophy in his attempt to understand the being of god, finds Plato a welcome ally. In passing he remarks that some notion of god is found among all men, especially among philosophers : „that is why they say, forced by truth itself as it were, that god is one, imperishable and unbegotten, always completely identical with himself ; he abides on high at the top of the heavenly arch in his own accustomed look-out point." 68 One is strikingly reminded of Plato's Phaedrus 69 and Politicus. 70 Clement goes on to interpret these philosophical insights as based on the sayings of the Sibyl, from which he takes this description of god : „The true, immortal god, enthroned in the heavens, and dwelling at the (heavenly) pole." 71 Evidently Clement understood Plato in his later dialogues to localize god in the only unmovable place (in the sense of „fixed," „unchangable") of the celestial 64.

For any other place „sufficient grounds" cannot be adduced. The author of De Mundo seems to be of the same opinion. Is it, in view of this, a solution to say that the notions of an unknown, late-Hellenistic writer, laid down in De Mundo, displaced the Platonic and early-Aristotelian under- standing which must have been familiar to Clement from his reading of De Philoso- phia ? 72 It seems to me that this would be too simple. Rather, we should seek to gain clarity on the philosophical-systematic significance of the localization of god at the heavenly pole. For this we must go back to Plato. Plato conceived of the totality of all soma as characterized by mutability {fiexaßoXrj, Politicus 269c) and a (three-dimensional) spherical shape. 73 From the Phaedrus onwards Plato derived all change of quality and place in somatic reality from the dynamis of the psyche. This psyche does not change qualitatively as soma does and is characterized by spatial motion in circular paths. With reference to psyche Plato does not use the spatial image of the sphere, but that of the (two-dimensional) circle. 74 The motion of the soul around a fixed center implies for the psychical circle immutability of place for the whole, but not for the parts. 75 Finally, Plato pictures the soul as „caused," „become ;" it does not have its origin in itself. 78 He holds this circular motion to be „comparable to" that of the Nous. 77 Here an identification of Nous as such and Psyche is excluded, but an analogy between them is posited. This analogy cannot be between circle and sphere by reason of the fact that the spherical is correlated with the three-dimensional soma. The only possibility left is an analogy between a turning circle and a rotating point ! The attractiveness of this view is clear at once. To the Greek mathematician the turning of the circle is determined and controlled by its center. The mathematical relations obtaining between point, circle and sphere can now be used to illustrate the relationships among Nous, psyche, and soma. The rotation on the geometric point may thus be understood as a model for the dynamis at its most immutable (identity with itself) of the Nous which is to be the focal point of the soulcirde when the latter is rightly directed and this in turn is the motor of the spherical „universe." These considerations lead to the conclusion that the celestial pole is the most appropriate location for a divine Nous characterized by motion without any kind of change. No other place befits god in a philosophical theology which, on the basis of Eleatic logic, teaches the immutabilitas dei. 72.

I return to the view of De Mundo c. 6. The descriptions there given imply that the author pictures god as seated upon the northern pole of the heavenly arch ; 79 his seat is the „acropolis" of the „cosmopolis" 80 In this connection it is good to remember that for a turning sphere an axis can be supposed (the line perpendicular to the turning-plane) of which both ends are „unmoved," „as in the case of a turning sphere clamped in a lathe." 81 This illustration shows that there is a being àxlvrjroç of the poles, together with the recognition of their turning. This is not a being unmoved in an absolute sense, but rather points to a turning without change of place. At the poles the most perfect motion goes hand in hand with the most complete stability ; it is the key to the philosophy Plato searched for in his later period. We must conclude, therefore, that the divinity who is enthroned upon the northern celestial pole is to be called „unmoved" in a spatial sense. The key-question is whether the author also meant to say that god is unmoved in the absolute sense. 82 I do not think this is the case. To make clear how the great variety of motion can be traced back to the one movement of the turning heaven brought about by the power of god, the author uses the images of an engineer who starts a complicated machine by pulling just one lever and of a puppeteer who with one motion of his hand achieves a great variety of effects. 83 In these metaphors things begin with a kind of self-movement on the part of the engineer and puppeteer respectively. We cannot but suppose that the author of De Mundo conceived of god as the cosmic central „power-station." According to him the first and simple spatial motion of the heaven consisting of the purest, most perfectly ordered aether (in Aristotle this 78.

Plato had located the controlling center of individual man in the head, which in Timaeus 70a6 is referred to as the „akropolis". The „high council" in Leges also meets at the acropolis of the city, from which the archons „look down upon all the city round as if from the highest peak" (XII, 946e). On these terms it is self-evident that the cosmic center of control must also be located at the highest central point of the cosmos. Cf. Plato, Cri tias 121c ; Politic/is 272e ; Timaeus 42e. 81.

He notes as contradiction „(God) is said to be both 'in' the Heaven (but the Heaven moves) and to be èv axivrjzq) etc." and „God is put now in an unmoved place which has to be imagined as situated on the other side of the First Moved Mover (the Stellar Sphere), now in this outer sphere itself." 83. ibtd., c. 6, 398bl4-19.</page><page sequence="15">328 A. P. BOS aether has replaced Plato's psyche), 84 is caused by the non-spatially qualified dynamis of the god 85 ensconced in the unshakably fixed heavenly pole. This dynamis as activity of the divine Nous is nothing but the movement of thought which, in the Platonic scheme of derivation, counts as the highest, most perfect form of self -movement. 86 Just as the circles described by the world-soul in the late-Platonic philosophy, therefore, the circular path of the heavenly vault in De Mundo is derived from a turning back to itself on the part of the divine mind, a non-spatially qualified orgéyeoeat, 87 a spiritual „reflection." 88 EVALUATION OF DE MUNDO'S COSMIC THEOLOGY. This theological conception in De Mundo should now be compared with the late- Platonic and traditional Aristotelian ones. As noted above, the Platonic deduction-philosophy sedes to present a complete derivation of physical and psychical reality (both qua existence and qua order) from the intelligible world. The dialectic of the divine Nous, ever identical with itself in its directedness to „the Other/' resulting in increasing determination of „the Indeterminate," is worked out ontologically as well, so that from the intelligible principia also that which determines and the undetermined at the level of psychical reality, and ultimately at the level of physical reality are deduced with the help of analogies. 8ft Aristotle radically rejected such deduction and its ontological metabasis. To him the somata are „given," and not to be traced back to „higher archaî' as was tried in the Timaeus. True reality, ousia in the primary sense, is all that belongs to the world of physical nature. Within this world Aristotle distinguishes between the realm of the perishable and the area of the divine, eternal element, the aether {De Cáelo I, c. 2, c. 3 and III, c. 1). It is important to note that the aether plays a part comparable to that of Plato's world-soul. When this is taken into consideration one must accept that 84. Compare A. T. Festugière, Le Dieu Cosmique 257 and A. P. Bos, On the Elements, 56-58. 85. Cr. 398b20; 399al ; 398bl3 ; 398b26 ; cfr. 399bll. 86. I refer to J. Pépin, Théologie cosmique, 198, who defends the thesis that in De Philosophia also Aristotle ultimately traces all motion in Physis back to self-motion, so that on this point that early work is a link in the chain from Plato to the Stoics. But according to him the ultimate self-motion is that of the heavenly sphere : „l' automotricité du ciel n'était ,dans le De Philosophia, contredite par l'intervention d'un Moteur extérieur encore à naître...". 87. Compare Plato, Politicus 269e5 and J. B. Skemp, The Theory of Motion in Plato's laier Dialogues; Amsterdam 19672 ; 24-25; 113. 88. H. Strohm, (art. 1952), 164, has felt something of the metabasis in De Mundo where its author explains divine causality. But Strohm does not relate this here to the structural metabasis of the late-Platonic philosophy, which derives physical reality from the intelligible reality by way of analogies. 89. For a somewhat more expanded account of the aim of late-Platonic philosophy see A. v. Bos, „Hyle in de wijsbegeerte van Aristoteles", Philosophia Reformata 40 (1975), 49-50, where reference is made to H. Happ, Hyle, Studien zum Aristotelischen Materie-Begriff ; Berlin 1971, eh. 2.</page><page sequence="16">THE THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTION IN DE MUNDO 329 it was introduced by Aristotle from a physicalistic viewpoint radically different from the Platonic stance. With regard to the early- Aristotelian cosmology the question then remains whether a distinction is made, comparable to the late-Platonic one, between a level of psyche (aether) and a level of Nous. Aristotle could not ignore the grounds on which Plato had defended the non-identity of Nous and psyche (the reality of emotions and drives). In the fragments of his early writings mention is made of both Nous and psyche. 90 But how did he see them mutually related when he began to work out his alternative to Plato's worldview ? If I am right in saying that Aristotle began as a physicalist, then the highest reality could not be conceived as something outside of or above Physis. One possible solution is the view defended by H. von Arnim, J. Moreau, J. Pépin, and others : the divine Nous is a function of the aether-substance, specifically, of the most remote heavenly sphere. A serious objection to this is that no justice can be done to the distinction between a psychical level of reality (for which the aether was introduced) and the Nous. To a close pupil of Plato a further objection would be that the circular motion, as a spatial one, does not possess the greatest possible degree of immutabilitas ; there is a continuous change of place for the parts of the circle. Looking once again at the cosmo-theological conception in De Mundo one cannot but note that the solution given there is the most obvious answer to the open question in the philosophy of the early Aristotle. It is an answer fully in line with the physicalism of the early-Aristotelian view, and explicable in terms of late-Platonic speculation. It is an answer, furthermore, whose difficulties are so obvious that Aristotle quite under- standably could not be satisfied for long. While the ontological metabasis of Plato's philosophy of being is indeed dropped, a metabasis eis allo genos tíñeseos is retained in the derivation of the physical motion of the „earthly elements" from the motions of the aether-substances which by reason of the rationality of their paths reveal that they are psychically qualified and endowed with reason. That motion is ultimately deduced from the movement of thought as continuous activity of the divine Nous. Further, in a physicalistic system, in which the three- dimensionality of everything somatic is paramount (De Cáelo I, c. 1), the divine intellect, the nucleus and control- center of the entire Physis is in fact reduced to a geometric point, i.e., the northern pole of the celestial axis. This complex of problems, together with the insights regarding the close coherence of psyche and soma gained by Aristotle in the course of his biological investigations, can yield an explanation of Aristotle's shift from a theological conception à la De Mundo to that of Metaphysica f' , which indeed radically differs from the physicalistic framework of his earlier philosophy, 91 but never quite lost its appearance of being an 90. The author of De Mundo c. 1, 391a8-12 also treats the threesome soma, psyche and nous as entities clearly mutually distinct. Compare G. Reale (1974), 197. 91. It has become clear, I trust, that in my opinion there is an important difference between the theology of De Mundo and that of Physica VIII + Metaphysica f' . That difference is completely overlooked by P. Gohlke, Aristoteles, Die Lehrschriften vol. 7, p. 7. Because this author takes De Mundo to contain the same doctrine of an unmoved mover as found in Metaphysica /', and</page><page sequence="17">330 A. P. BOS ad-hoc construction. The view of Metaphyska /', when compared with De Mundo, can afford us a clearer understanding of the basic tension in Aristotle's thought. On the one hand there is a continuation of one fundamental Aristotelian concern : the rejection of Platonic philosophy within a framework of analogical deduction is no longer limited to being but includes the rejection of a derivation of physical, spatial motion from a non-spatially qualified movement of thought. On the other hand, to the extent that Aristotle does not want to identify thought and physical reality completely materialistically, he arrives at a radical separation of the spheres of matter and of thought - a gap that is bridged neither in the cosmo-theology of Metaphyska /' , nor in the anthropology of De Anima. 92 With this, the hopelessness of onto-theological attempts to overcome the #co£ia/*&lt;íç between the reality of thought and the world of the senses has become dear. In a second article I will consider a number of issues in the text of De Mundo which, even after the appearance of the excellent commentary by G. Reale (1974), still deserve closer attention. since he follows H. von Arnim's late date for the latter, the consequence is that, if De Mundo is authentic, it must stem from the last years of Aristotle's life. On the basis of my study I believe the most attractive hypothesis to be that the theological conception of De Mundo must be much the same as that of the lost dialogue De Philosophia, and that De Motu Animalium provides the first hints towards a change that has worked itself out in Physica VIII and Metaphyska f'- Compare now G. Reale (1974), 31-34. 92. Already W. Jaeger has correctly pointed out that also the late- Aristotelian theology oí Metaphyska f' and De Motu Animalium are not without a metabasis, a leap from the physical into the analytic c.q. psychical ; Aristotle, 19482, 357 : „Even now his mover does not become a „force" of a physical kind ; but he speaks of its being touched by the moving cosmos as if there really were a spatial and physical relation between the two, and then destroys the point of his own acutely formulated problem by a transition to the intelligible world, namely the notion of the first principle moving the universe purely as an object of thought."
