<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD'S DEPUTY: MATERIALS ON ISLAM'S IMAGE OF MAN BY FRITZ STEPPAT HE anthropological question, What is man s place in the cosmos I and in history?, can be answered in the monotheistic religions only by referring to God. Man is God's creature. This does not mean, however, that he is merely God's object. By revealing himself to man, and by entering into history with him, God lifts man above the rest of his creation. This means for Christian theology that God makes man a person'. For Islamic theology too this statement should be acceptable. Man as an individual is responsible before God for his deeds. History as described by the Koran consists of a series of pacts ('ahd m-idq) between God an mankind which impose duties on mankind, but imply at the same time that God takes mankind as his partners. Certainly, the Koran does not view them as equal partners; but this is also true of the other religions. Can we define more precisely the rank which man occupies vis-'a- vis God in Islam? It is greatly different from that ascribed to him by Judaism and Christianism. For them the declaration of Genesis 1,26-27 holds good: God created man in his image. For Islam, with its anxiety to avoid anthropomorphism, this is impossible. The phrase was known to the Muslims in the shape of a hadft: God created Adam in his image, his form (cald s uratilih02; but they changed its meaning: according to Ibn Hazm, e.g., it does not say that Adam had been created in God's form, but that God chose for Adam one of the many forms in his possession in order to imprint it on him3. The statement of Koran 42,11 must remain valid: laysa ka-mitlihi s'ay', nothing is like God. I W.

STEPPAT Now there is a Koranic term which has a key function for defin- ing the rank of man in Islamic theology, the more so as a develop- ment of its interpretation can be observed: it is the word 4alffa with its derivatives, applied to Adam and other men. Of course the meaning 'caliph' comes into one's mind, originating from the fuller formula 4aljfat raszil Allah, 'successor to God's messenger', or the title halffat Alldh, used by some of the Umayyad caliphs, which must be translated by 'God's deputy', as God cannot have a 'successor'. In both cases the supreme head of the universal Islamic com- munity, the umma, is meant. But the Koran never makes it com- pletely clear whose 4alzfa the man in question is supposed to be. Rudi Paret, in his careful translation-work, has reached the conclu- sion that the Koran in all instances is referring to 'successors' of former generations or preceding groups. In his opinion suLra 2,30, where God tells the angels: I am going to place a halfa in the earth (innf gacilun ft 1-ardi balifatan), &lt;(must probably by understood in the sense that Adam (and with him mankind) shall in future succeed the angels (or the spiritual beings in general) as inhabitants of the earth&gt;&gt;4. It is not necessary to examine here whether Paret's opinion must be accepted everywhere. I may just mention that at least once in the Koran the term halzfa appears near an allusion to a rulership function of a man, namely in sura 38,26 when God, after appoin- ting David as halfa on earth, tells him: fa-4kum bayna n-ndsi bil-haqqi; Paret translates: &lt;&lt;Entscheide nun zwischen den Menschen nach der Wahrheit&gt;&gt; (decide, or judge, between men according to truth), but the verb hakama connotes also 'rule'. For our train of thought it is important that no less an authority than al-Tabari confirms Paret's opinion regarding the sense of halffa in the Koran-with some interesting additional remarks. In his Tafszr, the great commentary embracing all knowledge on the Koran at the level reached in the 3rd/9th century, al-Tabari defines halfa decidedly as 'successor' (idd qdma maqamahui ffhi bacdahui) with reference to preceding individuals, generations (qarn) or groups, thus excluding the meaning 'deputy'. He mentions the use of halfa for designing the 'supreme ruler' (al-sultan al-aczam), explaining the term as 'successor of the predecessor' without poin- ting to its origin from the formula halfat rasuil Alldh. But then, when 4 R. Paret, Der Koran: Kommentar und Konkordanz, Stuttgart, 1971, 16.</page><page sequence="3">GOD S DEPUTY 165 discussing sura 2,30, where God tells the angels that he will place Adam as 4alffa in the earth, al-Tabari records two transmitted explanations allowing the interpretation (ta 'wd) that God had appointed on earth a halpfa for himself or of himself who would deputize for him in judging between his creatures (/alffatan minnz ya4lufunifr 1--hukmi bayna 4alqihi bi-hukmihz)5. Nevertheless al-Tabari sticks to his understanding of hildfa as the succession of generations. We may therefore draw the following conclusion: The use of 4alffa for designating the ruler of the universal Islamic state was of course current at al-Tabari's time. Scholars probably remembered also the endeavours of Umayyad caliphs to interpret their title as 4alffat Alldh, 'God's deputy'. Because of this usage it would have seemed natural to give the word halffa the same sense when it appeared in the Koran, at least in some instances. On the other hand, the very strong awareness of an enormous distance between God and man made the great majority of scholars reluctant to ascribe to man such a high rank. Therefore they insisted on under- standing 4al7fa in the Koran as 'successor of predecessors'. It would be worth-while to follow in detail the ways in which the meaning of the word developed. As an random example I can men- tion a later classical Tafszr, al-Baydaawi's in the 7th/13th century, fourhundred years after al-Tabarl. From the beginning al-Baydawi gives 'deputy' as well as 'successor' as the meanings of halffa (man yahlufu gayrahii wa-yanuibu mandbahu). For interpreting the various instances in the Koran, he offers different possibilities without seem- ing to prefer one of them generally: 1. successor of former groups or generations; 2. in particular, successor of former rulers; 3. he records the explanation halfat Alldh ft ardihb, 'God's deputy in his earth', narrowing it, however, to mean the prophets as mediators between God and ordinary men, so that Adam would obtain this rank, not as the first man, but as the first prophet; 4. haldaif al-ard (sura 6,165) can mean God's deputies in his earth who are entitled to dispose of her (hulafdau lldhi dft ardihbiyatasarraflina fthd)6. Thus it has now become permissible to discuss whether human beings can be regarded as God's deputies on earth, even if we still observe the tendency not to grant this rank to mankind as a whole, but to limit it to the prophets. The direction in which development 5 Tafst-r al-Tabari, ed.

STEPPAT moved is confirmed by the fact that two centuries earlier the great theologian al-Gazall had already gone beyond al-Baydawi by con- ceiving an 'inner relationship' (munasaba bdtina) between man and God, which not only caused man to love God, but also made Adam's appointment as God's deputy on earth credible7. For al- Gazali there was no question of limiting this rank-or the relation- ship with God-to the prophets. He also found in the 'inner rela- tionship' an explanation for the dictum that God had created Adam after his form: it did refer to God's form, but his inner form, not the outer one, implying among other things ((man's closeness to his Lord in the properties which he is obliged to imitate, and in accep- ting the moral qualities of divine glory&gt;&gt;; only sufis would be able to find and name other elements of this relationship8. Al-Gazali's conception of man obviously was far ahead of that of the majority of orthodox scholars in his time, but he did mark the way for them. Skipping the long span of time from al-Gazali and al-Bayd.awi till the end of the nineteenth century, we discover that now the concep- tion of man as God's deputy on earth has achieved general recogni- tion. Of course the old understanding of the Koranic term halffa as 'successor of preceding groups or generations' is still known; no exegete of the Koran can afford to ignore al-Tabari. It strikes one all the more that-as far as I can see-this old understanding of the holy book is pushed aside, and that in fact only the new interpreta- tion is used as a basis for discussions and conclusions. This is already true of the great Egyptian Muhammad cAbduh (1849-1905), whose lectures on the Koran in al-Azhar from 1899 till his death were recorded by his disciple Muhammad Rasid Rida in the Tafstr al-Manar. In the commentary on sura 2,309, note is taken of both interpretations of the word halifa, without mentioning an explicit preference for one or the other, but it is clear that the new interpretation is given more weight. The view of man's rank thus indicated, undoubtedly corresponds to Muhammad cAbduh's theological conception as a whole'0: At the creation God has given all living beings, the physical and the metaphysical ones (meaning the angels), limited dispositions, limited inspired knowledge and limited functions-with the exception of man.

But when he grows up his sen- sual perceiving (i4sas) and his knowing (su'ucur) grow also, and in addition he is granted the ability of reason (caql), through which he can apply the first two abilities so as to win dominion (sul.tdn) over all other beings. By God's permission man's power to dispose is unlimited; the laws (ahkdm wa-sard)ic) which God gave mankind merely serve the purposes of setting boundaries to their deeds and morals so that they will not do wrong to each other, and of helping them to achieve perfection by guiding and developing their reason In this context particular importance is given to the statement of sura 2,31 that God taught Adam the names of all things'2: &lt;&lt;Through this story he lets us know our own worth and what was put into our nature, distinguishing it from the other creatures. Now we must strive for perfection by the sciences (al-culuim) for which he prepared us at our creation, before the angels and the rest of the creatures, so that God's wisdom would become visible in us))13. In this conception of Muhammad cAbduh and his disciples- compare also the Tafsir of Ahmad Mustafa al-Mardg114-man's appointment as God's deputy means that man has an unlimited power to dispose of all what is created, a power based mainly on knowledge, i.e. intellectual perception, and on reason. Certainly man, when exercising his dominion, is following God's design; but if he remains subject to the divine law this plays a rather secondary role as a means of orientation. There is a basically optimistic attitude behind this conception, a Lebensgef/hl determined by the great cultural achievements of mankind; the time is still before World War I. The Tafszr al-Manar also does not raise the question whether these achievements were brought about by Muslims or by non-Muslims'5. The appointment as God's deputy does not seem to have been granted to the followers of a particular religion, but to mankind as a whole.

STEPPAT state of Pakistan, translates God's announcement in Koran 2,30 straightaway: ((Verily I am about to place one in my stead on earth&gt;&gt;16. He connects it with Koran 33,72 where it is said that man has accepted ((the trust&gt;&gt; (al-amdna), after God had proposed it to the earth and the mountains, who refused it out of fear17. Iqbal explains this ((trust)&gt; in two ways. On the one hand it means precisely the function as God's deputy18. It is the lot of man to shape his own destiny as well as that of the universe, now by adjusting himself to its forces, now by putting the whole of his energy to mould its forces to his own ends and purposes; and when he takes this initiative, ((God becomes a co-worker with him&gt;&gt;19. But the strong confidence of man in himself which is expressed here does not mean boundless hubris, self-elevation. For on the other hand Iqbal interprets the ((trust&gt;&gt; proposed to man as the burden of personality which gives him freedom to choose between good and evil and holds out to him the prospect of achieving personal immortality by personal effort20. The high rank assigned to man by Iqbal is the result of an immense spiritual development and demands continuous striving for perfection 21. It seems important that Iqbal's conception includes a construc- tive social vision: The function of man as God's deputy is supposed to fulfil itself in a Koranic ideal state, in which ((the ownership of all land (i.e. the means of production) vests in God)&gt;, while it is ((man's duty ... to produce wealth for the benefit of all humanity&gt;)22. Turning from the modernists to the fundamentalists or-as it seems preferable to call them-the integralists, i.e. those who want to draw from religion the answers to all questions of private and public life, we may be surprised to find that they likewise consider man as God's deputy on earth. Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966), probably the most important theologian of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt23, 16 The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, Lahore, 1968, 13, 95. 17 Ibid., 11, 88, 95. 18 A.

Thus unity or coordina- tion (wahda aw tanasuq) has been established between the laws (nawdmi-s) of the universe and the laws imposed on man. Thereby man has reached a mighty position in the order of being as a whole24. But when further discussing the dictum of the Koran Sayyid Qutb-as opposed to cAbduh and Iqbal-does not go deeper into the question how man shapes the world by his reason through independent decisions. It seems to be more important for him how the appointment of man as God's deputy on earth can be reconciled with the fact that God exposes Adam and Eve to falling in sin before sending them to earth, and that the angels predict-correctly-that man will cause mischief there and spill blood; he points to the limits of human reason which cannot comprehend these metaphysical truths. In spite of this the faithful are called to accept the Koranic report as an instruction for their behaviour and their belief5. How an integralist position limits the evolution of human possibilities becomes even clearer from Abfil-Acla Mawduidi (1903- 1979), the founder and long-time leader of the Gamacat-i Islami in India and Pakistan. For him, too, it seems self-evident that man is God's deputy26. But man in this function does not only remain sub- ject to the divine law, this law is also strictly unchangeable and eter- nally valid27. It is true that Mawdtidi admits theoretically qiyads, igtihd, istihsdn and even ta'wfl, but the scope he leaves to these methods of applying human reason to Islamic law is so restrained that they remain practically inefficient28. Still it is remarkable that the ideal state conceived by Mawdufdi rests on a democratic foundation: the deputyship of God is sup- posed to belong neither to an individual nor to a dynasty or class, 24 FT zilal al-Qur'dn, second edition, Cairo, n.d., I, 29. 25 Ibid., I, 32. 26 E.g.

STEPPAT but to the whole of the community prepared to fulfil the conditions of the high rank; each member of the community participates in it. The community can confer the functions of the deputyship upon an individual enjoying its confidence, but when he loses this con- fidence he must resign29. At a closer look we recognise, however, that the community con- ceived by Mawdiidi can only consist of Muslims submitting to the law as he understands it. His democracy is an ((Islamic theo- democracy)&gt;. Whoever should believe that divine prescriptions could be changed, selected or rejected by human judgement, be it individual or collective, would have no place in the Islamic com- munity and no qualification for citizenship in the Islamic state30. Non-Muslims would certainly be confined to the status reserved by the traditional law to the ahl al-dimma: they would have to pay the gizya, could repair their places of worship, but not build new ones, and would not be represented in the parliament31. Thus the func- tion of God's deputy does not belong to mankind as a whole, but only to the Muslims, and even to them a narrow understanding of the law leaves but little freedom to shape the world. In general a verbal profession of democracy is questionable when coming from movements which are in themselves organised accord- ing to strict principles of hierarchy and leadership, as it is the case with Mawduidl's Gamacat-i Islam1 and with the Muslim Brothers of Egypt, at least in the first stage of their history. In any case, up to modern times we come across open professions of the opinion that the appointment as God's deputy can be con- fined to a single human individual, i.e. to a ruler. E.g., Ahmad Mustafa al-Maragi states expressly that the appointment of man to this rank includes the possibility that God selects a certain number of men in order to reveal his laws through their mouths, thus rais- ing them as caliphs above other men32. On the other hand, one gets the impression that quite a few modern thinkers take an interest in the appointment of man as God's deputy just because they can derive from it democratic con- ceptions of politics and society.

Authority belongs to the people and not to the Sultan. ... To it belongs all power-legislative, judicial and executive&gt;3. Similarly, in the discussions about the constitution of Pakistan it was argued that the caliphate based on the Koran must be the government of the people34. I do not know whether Muhammad Iqbal had already for- mulated this idea, but it would certainly have fitted his conceptions. The democratic slant is particularly noticeable in the interpreta- tion of the Iranian cAli Saricati (1933-1977)35, whose ideas con- tributed much to preparing the Islamic revolution of 1978/79, even if the Islamic republic resulting from it does not show a great deal of their influence. Saricati confronts the European humanism, which according to him grew up in opposition to medieval Chris- tianity to become the basis of modern western civilisation, with an Islamic humanism which he finds in the Koran. God created man from putrid clay, the lowest symbol of wretchedness and baseness, but he did so by breathing some of his own spirit into the clay, and he made man his viceregent upon earth. It reminds one of Iqbal when SariCati explains the trust which God handed over to man (al- amana) as the free will which distinguishes man from all other creatures: he can choose whether he wants to resemble mud or to resemble God. So in Islam man is not humbled before God, but accepted as God's partner and friend36. In the same way it recalls the ideal state of Iqbal, in which all means of production are God's property and must be employed for the benefit of the whole of mankind, when Saricati enjoins on man to establish a human paradise in nature37. Going farther, Saricati draws up a dichotomy in social history between the poles Abel and Cain-Abel standing for pastoral economy, primitive socialism before the emergence of property, i.e. a social structure in which society is its own master and all work for the common interest; Cain standing for agriculture, individual or monopolistic property, i.e. 3 U.

No matter whether this explanation can stand up to semantical examination or not, it brings us once more to a concep- tion which, in a particular sense, equalizes God and mankind-but in this case not men as individuals, but as the just society, organised according to God's will. The appointment of man as God's deputy becomes the basis of an Islamic socialism40. The materials summarized above have been collected more or less randomly. They do not describe the straight development of a uniform image of man in modern Islam. Yet it seems remarkable that in the course of time, and particularly in modern times, Muslims have widely turned towards a conception in which man is more than just God's object: a creature charged with certain divine functions and therefore resembling God in certain ways-God's deputy on earth. This is particularly interesting as by establishing this conception a Koranic term has obviously been reinterpreted against its original meaning. Muslims must have felt a strong urge indeed to attain this high rank. And even if the Koran was reinter- preted in this point, its general conception has permitted such a change of understanding. To be sure, it will be necessary to examine carefully the directions to which Muslims will move after taking the liberty of reinterpreting the word of the revelation.

Examination of the context shows, however, that in this declaration the Libyan leader was not referring to the appointment of man as God's deputy, but rather replying to suggestions, proposed by Islamic circles during the public debate, that Libya should be made a caliphal state. QaddMfT, recalling the history of the Umayyads and the 'Abbasids, regards the balfa as a despotic ruler not to be used as a model (speech of 29 December 1976, in al-Sigill al-qawmf 1976-77, 405; cf.
