<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL NOTES THE USE OF DIVINE NAMES AS SUPERLATIVES In the issue of the American Journal of Semitic Languages for January, 1928, there appeared an article of mine on "The Significance of Genesis 1:1-3." In this article among other points the position was taken that C'em 171 meant "a mighty (or tempestuous) wind." In that connection seven other cases of the same usage of bt, ='7R and b-~1 were discussed. Since the appearance of the paper in question, further research in the biblical text has disclosed a few more passages in which the same usage appears. To these attention is now called. The list is not even yet necessarily exhaustive. In II Kings 2:16 the phrase rn M is a bit difficult. Here , takes its verbs in the masculine, whereas elsewhere this noun is prevailingly feminine. It may well be, indeed, that the original text did not have the i' at all. In that case the reading was perfectly simple. The friends of Elisha propose to him that they shall send out a company of fifty men to search for the missing Elijah, saying, "It may be that Yahweh has picked him up and hurled him upon one of the mountains or into one of the valleys." If that was the primary text, then some later editor took exception to such a crass, anthropomorphic view of Yahweh and inserted ' before m7 to make the passage acceptable. But be that as it may, the phrase '71 " can mean here nothing more nor less than "a mighty wind," or "a hurricane." The only question is whether in this passage the '-) is a part of the original text, or a later modification of it. In either case the meaning of M~;'" m-l is indubitably clear, viz., "it may be that a tempestuous wind has picked him up and hurled him, etc." The same idiom 11 .10 ' appears again in Hosea 13:15. "The east wind, a most sultry wind from the steppe, shall come up and his fountain shall dry up and his spring be parched." This gives us a total of three cases in which ',"~ ; 1 or ,'1o  ' is used to denote some unusual or extraordinary wind. Again, in Psalms 83:13, we come across the same usage of 0 Os. Here the ancient foes of Israel, viz., Zebah and Zalmunna, are represented as having said, "Let us seize for ourselves the meadows (or pastures) of God." This, like the previously mentioned Kasap ilani, "the purest silver" (AJSL, XLIV, 112), most naturally means, "the finest (or best) pastures." In I Chronicles 12:23 is found another case of this usage of aig . Speaking of the rapid growth of David's army at the time of his taking over the Kingdom of Saul, it is said, "Thus from day to day they came to David 212</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL NOTES 213 to help him, until there was a great army, like an army of God," i.e., , ,. "';5, . "An army of God," of course, can be only "an immense army." In the same way II Chronicles 20:29, speaks of tJ3,'J1R "in "a terror of God." This is evidently "an awful terror." The passage thus reads, "So there came an awful terror upon all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that Yahweh was fighting against the enemies of Israel." The last case of this usage to be cited is Psalms 50:23. The verse as commonly rendered runs, He who offers thanksgiving honors me, And him who heeds the way, I will show God's deliverance. The context requires that the "me" and the "I" should refer to God who has been speaking continuously since verse 16. This requirement thus makes God, in accordance with the translation just cited, refer to himself in the first person in the first part of the verse, and in the third person at the end of the verse. This difficulty at once disappears if it be recognized that "God" here is the equivalent of a superlative expression. "God's deliverance" is but the most striking way of saying "a wonderful deliverance." The whole thought of the verse loses every suggestion of inner inconsistency if we render, "He who offers thanksgiving honors me; And him who leads the way, I will show a marvelous deliverance." A systematic scrutiny of the biblical text from this point of view would probably yield further cases of the same usage. The purpose of this brief note is simply to impress upon the minds of scholars the fact of the presence of this usage in the Old Testament, to the end that it may always be in mind as a possibility when 5t, C;1,"b and 1" appear in the Hebrew text.
