Dr. Larson is a contributing editor of Print Collector's Newsletter. In the early 19th century, the Mississippi River Valley was the gate- way to frontier America, separating the sophisticated, settled East from the unknown, romantic West. The post-Civil War industrial boom dramatically altered the river's primeval state, but its popular mythology continued along lines set by Audubon's images of birds, by Fanny Palmer's riverboat pictures for Currier and Ives, and by idealized views of river towns. Its valleys, farms and wildlife inspired an enormous body of colored prints which hung in thousands of American homes. For 50 years wood engravings made nationwide news out of disasters, floods and social events on the river. Images of the river evoked westward expansion, independence and the uniting of a vast continent. But by the turn of the century it was all over. Photography and high-speed offset printing replaced handcrafted illustration. Trains replaced riverboats as symbols of scenic travel. Sprawling industry and uncontrolled hunting pushed many of Audubon's exotic water birds into inaccessible areas, driving some to near extinction. Saw- mills stopped for want of timber, new flour mills were located in prairie railroad towns and river banks became shanty towns and garbage dumps. What the river looked like during its great era, and what it meant to a nation wildly in love with its landscape was recorded in hundreds of prints. John James Audubon was the first American to extract specific images from his river travels and make art of them. In 1820 he conceived the most ambitious printmaking project of 19th century America: the four volume, 435 plate Birds of America. He had followed birds since his youth and after studying in Paris spent ten years in Kentucky and Ohio, training himself in natural science and illustration. He experi- mented with bird banding, then devised a system for supporting and drawing specimens in life-like positions. On a boat trip between Cincinnati and New Orleans he sketched birds as he encountered them, along the broadest and most widely trafficked migratory corridor in the world. He headquartered in New Orleans for six years and, assisted by his two sons, collected and drew hundreds of specimens from the delta region. He traced their outlines and colored eyes and feet rapidly before they faded in the freshly killed bird. Trekking into backwaters and swamps, Audubon claimed his task had been "allotted to him by nature." He knew he would probably be the last to witness and record many species in their natural haunts. (Of the river birds Audubon celebrated in his Birds of America, the white ibis was nearly extinct by 1900, but has made a good come- back, while the whooping crane is still an endangered species, and the trumpeter swan needs careful protection.) Audubon hoped that his work would find immediate acceptance when he left for Philadelphia in 1824 with the finished studies, but publishers there had already committed themselves to Alexander Wilson's American Ornithology. In London in 1826 he met a superb illustrator, Robert Havell, who set up a shop to produce the project. Havell and his son Robert Jr. engraved, etched and aquatinted the plates. Over 100 trained colorists added watercolor and tempera in close imitation of Audubon's original paintings. The likeness of the prints to the originals was a superb techni- cal accomplishment, since the drawings were eccentric mixtures of pen, pencil, pastel, oil, tempera and watercolor. The finished sets cost 1,000 dollars, and Audubon returned to America several times to seek additional species and to secure subscribers. Audubon had no acquaintance with Japanese art, but in France he could not have missed the elegant "S" curves and chinoiserie of the French Rococo, a style that Neo- classicism never fully supplanted. His great skill at inventing flat, curvilinear design led him to portray birds with the neck, legs and body pressed into nearly the same plane. Creatures turn to form picturesquely curving, sinuous shapes on the page. This is particularly true of the Mississippi River water fowl, and Audubon's journals make many references to the strangely twisting necks of swans and herons. In the bird prints, backgrounds are skillfully designed after nature, or, are left out entirely to allow the white of the page to isolate the subject.

On the other hand, these are not nature scenes; they are portraits, and like most portraiture of the time, background is frequently remote or schematic. Audubon's bird pictures are emotionally cool, but always show the creatures as active and keenly intelligent. This separates them from the great hoard of sentimental, anthropomorphic portrayals of animals common in Victorian Europe and America, and allows us to concentrate as much on the plumage as we do on the bird's posture. Nearly every pose suggests the bird is motivated by a specific purpose. Audubon's text accompanying the plates emphasizes the creature's instinctual behavior. He writes of the white ibis: Its unusual mode of procuring food is a strong proof that cunning enters as a principal ingredient in its instinct. The cray-fish often burrows to the depth of three or four feet in dry weather ... The bird .., walks with remarkable care towards the mounds of mud which the latter throws up and breaks up the upper part of the fabric, dropping the fragments into the deep cavity ... The ibis retires a single step, and patiently waits ... The cray-fish ... instantly sets to work anew, and at last reaches the entrance of its burrow, but the moment it comes in sight, the ibis seizes it with its bill. Audubon makes certain value judgments throughout Birds of America and the larger Mississippi River fowl are heroically positioned before complex foliage, sky and water. Exotic species are always given fuller narrative than the small brown or tan shore birds, and ducks are commoners in the midst of aristocratic swans or cranes. Audubon's prints give these birds a dignity and stature rare among people who regarded river birds as easy targets for hunting or hat decoration. Audubon died in New York City in 1851, where coincidentally, a year later, James Merritt Ives joined the lithography publishing firm of Nathaniel Currier. They formed the most famous partnership in American art history. Their letterheads read, "The Grand Central Depot for Cheap and Popular Prints" and "Colored Engravings for the People." Currier and Ives lithographs captured, if not actually created, a mythology of the Mississippi River. Its staff did not have Audubon's European background, his taste for the aristo- cratic print, or even his interest in scientific veracity. They were commercial artists who drew material from newspapers, gossip and ordinary illustration. When "name brand" artists like George Inness, Thomas Nast, or John Cameron were used, it was usually to reproduce one of their oil paintings. Most of the Mississippi River prints were drawn on stone by the English immigrant Fanny Palmer, who worked with Currier and Ives from 1850 to her death in 1864, a period of time that spanned the naval battles of the Civil War, the building of great riverboats and the national drive to settle west of the Mississippi. She was a landscape specialist, often adding background to the work of other staff artists and for New York subjects she often made her own sketches, using both sides of the paper and a soft pencil. We don't know if she ever saw the Mississippi River and she probably relied on sketches sent from the Louisiana Territory for her prints of paddlewheelers, ironclads, flatboats and trains. Fanny Palmer was also a highly skilled colorist and she painted many production line models. Color lithography was virtually unknown and all Currier and Ives prints were black and white lithographs pulled from single stones of Bavarian lime- stone, then hand-colored. The success of the operation relied on incredibly cheap labor. Coloring was done by a crew of twelve young women, usually of German descent, who worked at a long table from a model set in the middle. Each woman did only one color, then passed it on, and the finisher touched up. For rush jobs the drawing was made on several stones and printed at once. Extra help was called in and stencils used to hurriedly apply colors, with the regular girls all touching up. Even with all this hand work, Currier and Ives could have a print on the streets in three or four days or about as fast as the wood engravers who worked for Harper's Weekly. Some of Fanny Palmer's larger, more detailed works, 45</page><page sequence="5">artist unknown Pillsbury Mills, circa 1906 Collection: Minnesota Historical Society As the mid-19th century was the great era of printmaking, it was also the period of intensive riverside milling.

Steamboat racing was among the most frequently drawn images, though night racing, as shown in this example, would have been a river pilot's nightmare. Difficult and extremely dangerous even in daylight, racing often ended in disastrous explosions as the steam-driven engines were pushed beyond their normal capabilities and temperatures.

Working from the model, they were paid one dollar a dozen -or as many as they could do on a weekend, and this was probably about as much as Fanny Palmer earned. Many of the Mississippi River prints were so popular that they were printed over a period of years, with considerable variation in color. Editions were unlimited and cheap -small prints retailed for 15 to 25 cents, large folios from 1.50 to 3.00 dollars. Currier and Ives worked perfectly together- Currier the artist, Ives the businessman. This craftsman- salesman duo owned a printing shop on Spruce Street and a retail shop around the corner on Nassau Street, the traditional factory-store combine. From the 1 830s to the 1 890s the firm turned out over 7,000 subjects, over 100 of these about the Mississippi. They technically perfected the single run, black and white lithograph and one of the reasons they could run so many good impressions was the superior lithographic crayon and ink Nathaniel Currier's brother Charles invented. The Currier crayon was a blend of wax, soap, and shellac. The ink was an incredible blend of beef suet, goose grease, white wax, castile soap, gum mastic, shellac and gas lamp black. Coloring was accomplished with the finest Austrian pigments available, and a light sheen or varnish was often added on darker parts to increase luminosity. Fanny Palmer's career coincided with the years in which the firm introduced improved materials, and with the availability of skilled colorists. Currier and Ives's prints of Civil War naval battles on the Mississippi express the aspirations and prejudices of the North. As propaganda, they describe only the victories; as news they view a battle as a fireworks display. As can be seen from a half- dozen battle lithographs the Union ironclads penetrated deeply into the Rebel interior, but the South was well dug in. There is an admirable attempt to illustrate total war, even though most of their information was gleaned from the poorly illustrated New York Press. Most famous of all the Mississippi River subjects are the steamboat races. The contest between the Robert E. Lee and the Natchez, claimed to have taken place in July of 1870 in less than four days (or a somewhat unbelievable 13 miles an hour), may not have taken place at all. The side to side Midnight Race on the Mississippi is an idealization reflecting Currier and Ives's love for sporting events and their Yankee need to see the Mississippi as a life stream uniting East and West. H. D. Manning made the original sketches, and Fanny Palmer drew it on stone, but the concept behind the work is pure Currier and Ives. Another genre of early lithography is the bird's-eye view town panorama. Currier and Ives and many other publishers sold town views before the Civil War. By the 1 880s, the documentary aspect of the craft was perfected; their 1885 perspective of New Orleans remains one of the finest ever made and crowds as much detail as possible into every square inch of the sheet. Most early views are schematic and outskirts are shown quite prematurely developed, as if the local chamber of commerce had prodded the artist to predict a building boom. Usually, an imaginary viewpoint holds us a couple of hundred feet off the ground, with somewhat contradictory or multiple point perspective intended to enhance legibility. In the bird's-eye view prints, Mississippi River towns are portrayed for their vital river commerce and for the busy industry along their banks. Since early rail lines followed the river, rail yards also appear prominently. Minneapolis offered everything for this idiom, since both its banks (Minneapolis and the old city of St. Anthony) were heavily built up with flour mills, lumber mills and railways. It is a happy coincidence that two of the most intricately detailed views made in America are W. V. Herancourt's 1885 and Frank Pezolt's 1891 views of Minneapolis. The first of these is more realistically drawn and gives a strong impression of commercial activity along the river's major structures- the stone arch railway bridge (there just happens to be a passenger train on it), St. Anthony Falls, and the second suspension bridge. In the second view, this is replaced with its present iron truss bridge, covered with new trolley tracks (and there are now two trains crossing the stone arches). A. M. Smith, a local wine distributor, 47</page><page sequence="7">J. T. Palmatary Bird's-Eye View of St. Louis, (detail), circa 1870 Collection: Missouri Historical Society The bird's-eye city view had become a convention by the 19th century and was used extensively to document river cities. Its formula approach consisted of translating all identifiable components - houses, boats, wharves, streets- into diagrammatic volumes. The entire complex was located on a ground plane receding into the distance. The Palmatary view of St. Louis is an aristocrat of this genre by virtue of its large scale (at 45-1/2 x 94-1/8 inches, it is more than twice as large as the average bird's-eye print), which permits the most concise description of each element; virtually every street is labeled and every steamer along the riverbank can be recognized. These views provided information much like that now gained through low-level aerial photography yet, the bird's-eye view from which all superfluous detail has been edited-and to which more than a few idealizing touches have been added-systematically provided more information than any photograph could supply.

Not only does Mr. Smith place his name in its rightful place above his own establishment on Hennepin Avenue, but his "wine vaults" are squeezed into the lower right corner and "Go to A. M. Smith's 249 Hennepin Ave." appears on the roofs of the train sheds of the Milwaukee Road station, where only the pigeons would have seen it. Smith then points out that Minne- apolis is, "The most properous city in the United States, where 22 mills grinds [sic] over 10,000 barrels of flour pr. year." We are also told the city has grown from 8,106 in 1865 to 200,000 in 1892-this when the print was published in 1891. By the turn of the century, the wet plate photograph almost totally supplanted lithography as a recording tool. No serious professional photographer ever fully documented the upper Mississippi, but hundreds of panoramic photographs survive. Many of these are two and three part, and were crudely printed from glass plate negatives. Most of these photographs are inferior to the bird's- eye view lithographs, since they show only a small section of town, and usually concentrate on the town square, whether or not it was the real center. For the Mississippi River towns, it almost never was (Jackson Square in New Orleans is an exception), and towns like Minneapolis, Dubuque, Winona and St. Louis spread along the river, with no central focus. What the photographs do show are expanding, jerry-built towns, whose manu- facturing and transportation focused on the river. Commercial photography was still in its infancy, but it was fast, cheap and able to capture detail impossible with crayon lithography. Today hand-drawn illustrations in scientific literature, and hand-rendered bird's-eye views have been revived by the startling isometric views of the German publisher Hermann Bollmann, but now both are photomechanically reproduced on the high-speed lithography press. The great era of popular hand lithography was regrettably short, as was the great era of the river itself. 50</page><page sequence="10">published by Currier and Ives The City of New Orleans, 1885 Collection: Library of Congress Among the most complex town views published by Currier and Ives, this print depicts a bustling harbor where over 50 boats are docked.
