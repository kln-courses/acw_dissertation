Rouhana, Edward A. Jędrzejczak, and Joseph D. McCleary Biomedical Science Dept. General Motors Research Laboratories ABSTRACT The Frangible Abdomen is a crushable Styrofoam insert for the abdominal region of the Hybrid III family of dummies, which has biofidelity, and assesses the occurrence of submarining and its risk of injury. It was first developed for the mid-sized male Hybrid III dummy. This paper describes the design of the Frangible Abdomen for the small female Hybrid III dummy, and how to use it to assess the occurrence and the risk of injury from submarining. The force-deflection properties of the mid-sized male insert were scaled to the small female dimension using equal stress/equal velocity scaling. Sled tests were run to compare the kinematic and dynamic performance of the baseline small female Hybrid III dummy with the same dummy modified to incorporate the Frangible Abdomen. The kinematic and submarining performance of the small female Hybrid III dummy was unchanged by the addition of the Frangible Abdomen. The Frangible Abdomen was easy to install and use, and had excellent repeatability. Injury assessment with the Frangible Abdomen is based on the depth of foam deformation. Tables and graphs are included which relate the risk of injury to the amount of crush. Issues regarding its use, handling, applicability, spinal injury, belt roping, and unilateral submarining are discussed. Appendices containing information on retrofitting existing dummies, calibration testing of Styrofoam, and with more detailed tabulations of sled test data are provided. LAP BELT SUBMARINING can be defined as relative motion between the occupant and the lap belt such that the lap belt load shifts from the pelvic skeletal structure to the softer abdominal region. Submarining sometimes occurs during the development tests of a belt restraint system, but it can be difficult to objectively assess using a standard anthropomorphic test device (dummy) [1]* . Previous authors have suggested a variety of dummy modifications to provide submarining assessment capability including: a pelvis, developed by Daniel, which is fitted with load bolts to measure belt force on the anterior iliac spines as a function of time [2], a strain gauged beam within the abdominal cavity, developed by APR [3,4], measurement of pelvic rotation using a five accelerometer array [1], and others [5-9]. While there has been some success with these methods, none of them provides the combination of biofidelity in the abdominal force- deflection response, objective indication of the occurrence of submarining, and more importantly, a quantitative estimate of the risk of injury to the abdominal organs. Rouhana, et al. [10] recently proposed a method for submarining assessment using an abdominal insert which has biofidelity under belt loading conditions, and the capability to assess both the occurrence of submarining and the risk of injury associated with it. The insert, known as the Frangible Abdomen, was developed using the mid-sized male Hybrid III dummy, with the plan to implement a scaled version in the small female (5th percentile) Hybrid III dummy when it became available. The development of the Frangible Abdomen for the mid- sized (50th percentile) male dummy was described in [10]. The purpose of this paper is to document the extension of the Frangible Abdomen concept to the small female Hybrid III dummy, and to describe the method of assessing injury risk using the Frangible *Numbers in square brackets indicate references which are listed at the end of the paper. 1760</page><page sequence="2">Abdomen. This report includes the scaling procedure used to obtain the stiffness corridor of the dummy abdomen, and details of the design, construction, and sled testing of the small female frangible abdomen. It also includes tables of data which relate the amount of deformation measured from the foam insert to the risk of abdominal injury associated with that deformation. The extension of this concept to the small female dummy is important in light of recent results which indicate that the old small female dummy (ARL VIP-5F) has a tendency to submarine more readily than the mid-sized male dummy [1], DESCRIPTION OF THE FRANGIBLE ABDOMEN The Frangible Abdomen is a crushable foam insert, which is shaped with 5 tapered points to achieve a force-deflection response similar to the human abdomen. When belt loading of the foam occurs, the foam crushes and remains crushed leaving a permanent record of the maximum penetration. Visual inspection of the foam determines whether submarining occurred, and if so, measurement of the depth of crushed foam allows one to make an objective estimate of the risk of occupant injury due to that loading. The Frangible Abdomen consists of three main components: 1) a foam insert which serves as the deformation transducer, 2) a reaction plate for the foam insert, and 3) a support bracket which couples the reaction plate and insert to the pelvis. 1) The foam insert (Figure 1) is located in the abdominal cavity of the dummy (beneath the rib cage, in front of the lumbar spine). The geometry of the insert gives it a force-deflection response similar to a human abdomen in belt loading (biofidelity). On each side of the "central point" of foam (Figure 2, Top View) is a "major side point" (the larger point) and a minor side point (the smaller point). 2) The reaction plate, is located behind the foam insert in the dummy, and as the name implies, is the surface which supports the foam insert during belt loading (Figure 3). 3) The support bracket bolts to the pelvic structure to anchor the reaction plate (Figure 4), and serves as the attachment point for the lumbar spine in place of the standard lumbar spine attachment cylinder. The position of the reaction plate was chosen to reduce the possibility of interference with the lumbar spine when the dummy torso flexes forward, while at the same time allowing room for a 121mm (4.75") foam insert in front of the plate. Prints of the various components of the small female Frangible Abdomen are given in Appendix I. Figure 1 . Frangible Abdomen in place in a Hybrid III mid-sized male dummy (beneath the rib cage, in front of the lumbar spine, behind the abdominal "skin", above the pelvis). DUMMY MODIFICATIONS As for the mid-sized male dummy [10], the rotary potentiometer for measuring chest deflection must be removed from the small female dummy for the installation of the Frangible Abdomen. Figure I.4, in Appendix I, shows the replacement for the bracket which holds the chest deflection potentiometer, and which joins the thoracic spine to the lumbar spine. The front edges of the upper lumbar spine attachment plate and the chest deflection potentiometer replacement plate are machined so that they are flush with one another, and are as far back in the dummy as possible (as close to the front surface of the lumbar spine as possible). The front two 1/4-20 "socket head cap" screws used to connect the lumbar and thoracic plates are replaced with 1/4-20 "button head socket cap" screws. To measure chest deflection in these experiments we used a high tension string potentiometer (Space Age Controls Model 160-321H; 56oz. pull). The string pot body was mounted to the thoracic spine at a position just below the 3rd rib. The end of the string was connected to a point mount on the sternum approximately 25mm lateral of the mid-sagittal plane with the string perpendicular to the rib cage at the point of attachment. The addition of the reaction plate and other attachment hardware to the small female dummy caused the weight to increase by 0.59kgf (1.3 Ib.), from 4.81kgf (10.6 lb.) to 5.40kgf (11.9 Ib.).

Making the reaction plate out of aluminum would lower its weight by approximately 0.68kgf (1.5 Ib.). Addition of 0.09kgf (0.2 lb.) of ballast would bring the dummy's weight back to the design value. More details regarding the procedure to retrofit an existing dummy are given in Appendix I. SCALING THE STIFFNESS OF THE FOAM INSERT A response corridor for belt loading to the abdomen of a mid-sized male was previously established [10], based on the experiments performed by Miller [11]. The first step in the extension of the Frangible Abdomen concept to the small female dummy was to scale the mean value from the mid-sized male force-deflection corridor to one for small females. We used equal stress/equal velocity scaling [12,13] and assumed geometric similitude exists between the model (small female) and prototype (mid-sized male). Then the scale factor for length dimensions is the ratio of some characteristic length dimension in the model to the same length dimension in the prototype. That is, I (small female) X = l( mid-sized male) where, X1 is the length scale factor, and I = the characteristic length in the model or the prototype. With equal stress/equal velocity scaling, the force scales as A 2 and the length scales as Xr Since the stiffness is the ratio of force over length, it also scales as Ať Then, the length scale factor can be applied to the mid-sized male abdominal stiffness to determine the abdominal stiffness of the small female. The characteristic length chosen for this scaling was the distance between the 5th lumbar vertebra (L5) and the maximum abdominal protrusion. Two values were selected from the various anthropometric studies reported in the literature. A study done at UMTRI for the NHTSA sponsored Advanced Anthropomorphic Test Device project [14], provided a value of the characteristic length for subjects seated in automotive seats. A data base compiled by NASA on the anthropometry of military subjects provided a value of the characteristic length for standing subjects [15]. The distance between L5 and the maximum abdominal protrusion in the UMTRI study was 258mm for the mid-sized male, and 205mm for the small female vehicle occupants measured. Then, the UMTRI based scale factor for length and stiffness is equal to 0.795 (the small female abdominal stiffness should be 0.795 times the mid-sized male stiffness). Scaling the 23N/mm mid-sized male abdominal stiffness results in a value of 18N/mm for the small female abdominal stiffness. The abdominal depth of standing subjects in the NASA data base was 208mm for the mid-sized male, and 180mm for the small female. These dimensions yield a NASA based scale factor of 0.866, and a scaled stiffness equal to 20N/mm. While the UMTRI anthropometry is representative of seated automotive occupants, the NASA anthropometry more closely approximates the subject posture in the Miller experiments [11] which form the basis of the force-deflection corridor. Both NASA's and Miller's subjects had their torsos extended (in the anatomical sense), which shortens the abdominal depth by eliminating the paunch induced by the seated posture. But since NASA's subjects were standing and Miller's subjects were supine (on their backs), they may have different external abdominal dimensions because of movement of the highly mobile abdominal organs, toward the feet in NASA's subjects and towards the back in Miller's subjects. The stiffness chosen for the small female Frangible Abdomen was the 18N/mm value based on the UMTRI anthropometric measurements. This value was used because it is representative of seated occupants and the UMTRI study served as the basis for the small female Hybrid III anthropometry. Since this value yields a lower stiffness after scaling, the abdomen developed will be more conservative than if we had used the dimension given by the NASA study. MATERIAL TESTS ON FOAM FOR THE INSERTS The flotation Styrofoam used for the Frangible Abdomen is obtained in a relatively large block called a billet (ours were 10"x20"x96"; Dow Chemical calls them Buoyancy Billets). The direction of crushing was found to affect the force-deflection properties as will be discussed later, so a billet coordinate system was set up as shown in Figure 5. The outer surface of the billet of Styrofoam was cut off and the sides of the billet made parallel. The outer surface was removed, because in the manufacturing process a tough skin forms on the billets which affects the force-deflection properties of the foam inserts. About 13mm(.5") was removed from both the top and the bottom, and 25mm (1") from each side of the billet to remove the skin and square off the faces. Then, before any other cuts were made on the billet, a template of the top view of the Frangible Abdomen was used to draw the pattern on the top surface of the billet. The orientation of the inserts within the billet must be such that the back ends of the Inserts are facing the edges of the billet (Figure 6). Drawing the insert pattern on the billet before cutting eliminates the possibility of making a mistake in orientation. Using this procedure more 1763</page><page sequence="5">' T0P ' ' ^ -^HEIGHT L END Figure 5. Styrofoam billet with coordinate system convention. than 60 inserts were obtained from one 10"x20"x96" billet of Styrofoam. Material tests on the foam inserts were performed using a Material Test System (MTS), which is a high speed hydraulic piston. One of two impact interfaces was attached to the piston. For Styrofoam calibration tests, a 25.4mm (1") diameter flat aluminum disk was used. For testing foam insert sample patterns, a belt- yoke fixture was used with standard automotive belt webbing as the impact interface. The belt-yoke setup was described in [10], and the reader is referred to that publication for further information on the test equipment and procedure. The force-deflection curves of the samples were compared to the scaled force-deflection corridors. If the sample was too stiff or not stiff enough, the geometry of the sample was modified, and the tests were repeated. These iterations continued until the force-deflection corridor was matched by the Styrofoam, which established a shape for the small female Frangible Abdomen foam inserts. The force-deflection curves for the small female Hybrid III dummy Frangible Abdomen are shown in Figure 7 with the scaled abdominal force-deflection corridor superimposed. The shape of the abdominal insert that gave this force-deflection response is shown in Appendix I, Figure 1.1. Like the insert for the mid-sized male dummy, the force-deflection of the small female insert is in good agreement with the established corridor and has excellent repeatability. The curves in Figure 7 represent 25 identically shaped inserts from different positions in 7 different billets of Styrofoam (4 different positions within each of 5 billets, 3 different positions in 1 billet, and 2 different positions in 1 billet). Thus, the Frangible Abdomen repeatability encompasses different samples with the same shape, different locations within a single billet, and different billets. end AAA AA SIDE Figure 6. Top view of billet showing orientation of templates for cutting out foam inserts. Note that because of edge effects, inserts cut from the edges of a billet are cut with their back ends toward the sides of the billet (inserts cut from the middle can face either side). Also, the front to back axis of the insert is parallel to the side-to-side direction of the billet. We developed a material test, to calibrate new billets of Styrofoam, which encompasses crushing a 76mm (3") cube of foam. The cubes for calibration testing were cut from the middle of a 76mm (3") wide slice off of either end of the billet (Figure 8). The aluminum disk compressed the cube in a side-to-side direction with respect to the billet coordinate system. The side-to-side direction was chosen for calibration because that is the direction of crush of the inserts machined from the billet. The typical crush distance 1764</page><page sequence="6">4-1--! ! , , ! i i i » i i ; ; ; / ; ; : : : ' : : 3- : I j /• •: : : : : # : : : : : / : : : : : L-'* Mr Mean Vqlue - ^ Meqn - 1 s.d.

The corridor is the mean value, plus and minus one standard deviation, of the normalized force-deflection response from the lap belt tests performed by Miller [11]. we used was 51mm (2"), and tests were conducted both quasi-statically and dynamically. The Styrofoam samples we tested were not rate dependent. The force-deflection curves for 14 cubes of foam (one from each of 2 different positions in 7 different billets), tested in a side-to-side crush direction, are shown in Figure 9. On the scale of the calibration cubes, the properties of Styrofoam flotation foam are not isotropic, nor homogeneous. Therefore, the force- deflection response in the cube calibration tests is a function of the position of the sample within the billet. The stiffness of the cube samples within 102mm (4") of the edge of the billet can be greater than those taken from the middle of the billet. Because of this anisotropy in the material response, it is recommended that the samples used for calibration check of the foam be taken from the middle region of the 76mm (3") slice of foam from the billet.

However, the Frangible Abdomen foam inserts should be cut such that the back surfaces of the inserts face the edge of the billet rather than the middle of the billet (the tips of the points face the middle of the billet) (see Figure 6). Shortly after we developed the prototype small female Frangible Abdomen insert, the maker of Styrofoam changed its formulation to replace the CFC blowing agent used in production. This change in formulation was reflected in different stiffness results on the level of the cubes and the small female Frangible Abdomen foam inserts, but did not affect the larger mid-sized male foam insert. When the cause for the difference in properties was determined, the small female insert pattern was modified to match the scaled force-deflection corridor again. This illustrates both a negative and a positive aspect of the Frangible Abdomen concept. On the negative side, there may be effects, on the force- deflection properties of different batches of Styrofoam, which necessitate the calibration tests. On the positive side, the design is robust enough such that the force-deflection can be adjusted easily by changing the pattern of the foam. Previous experience with different batches did not show different properties, so now that the Styrofoam formulation has stabilized again, there should be no need to alter the pattern of the foam insert, but calibration checks are of the utmost importance if biofidelity and accuracy in injury risk assessment are to be assured. Appendix II contains a discussion of considerations necessary for changing the shape of the foam insert. SLED TESTS WITH THE FRANGIBLE ABDOMEN A series of sled tests was performed using a HYGE sled with a body buck to compare the kinematics and dynamics of the baseline Hybrid III small female dummy with the kinematics and dynamics of the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen installed. The sled tests reported here were conducted with the prototype small female Frangible Abdomen hardware. Analysis of the data showed that there was contact between the steel plate on top of the lumbar spine, and the Frangible Abdomen hardware which affected some of the dynamic measurements. The design was modified to reduce the possibility of contact. There was no evidence of contact in 6 out of 6 tests performed with the modified design. The more extensive tests of the prototype are reported here, because they clearly demonstrate that the Frangible Abdomen had no effect on kinematics or submarining performance of the dummy, and only limited effect on dynamics of the dummy. Our judgement is that the modifications made, which are Figure 9. Force-deflection curves for 14 cubes of Styrofoam from 7 different billets, tested in a side-to-side crush direction. included in the prints in Appendix I, should improve the agreement between the baseline and Frangible Abdomen dummy configurations. The tests were run with the dummy seated on the driver's side of the buck in an automotive bucket seat. There was no dashboard or steering system in the sled buck. The structures to which the steering column and instrument panel normally bolt were present in the sled buck, but were padded with Rubatex R310V foam. The seat used in these tests was constructed of foam on a zig-zag spring suspension and sheet metal frame. The foam Indentation Load-Deflection characteristic was î:240N. The seat pan angle was ^8°, and the seat back angle was ^26° (not a reclining seat). The seat was fixed 2 notches forward of the full rear position, and a block of Styrofoam was placed in front of each foot of the dummy to simulate the toe pan of the vehicle. A standard automotive lap-shoulder belt was fastened around the dummy in one of three configurations (see below). The belt was a single retractor, continuous loop system with a locking latch plate. The retractor was mounted to the B-pillar of the sled buck, and was pre-locked. The dummy was pre-positioned by setting the head, H-point, and knee targets in locations marked by 3 laser beams fixed in the laboratory reference frame. The belt system configurations were chosen to specifically vary the degree of submarining. All configurations used the same anchor locations. The configurations consisted of: i) No submarining - The lap belt was cinched tight and 76mm (3") of slack was introduced into the shoulder belt before locking the retractor. This 1766</page><page sequence="8">configuration would allow upper torso rotation, but minimize lower torso translation and minimize the probability of submarining. ii) Dynamic submarining - The lap belt was placed in proper position beneath the anterior-superior iliac spines (ASIS points) of the pelvis, but with 76mm (3") of slack, and the shoulder belt was cinched tight. A strip of tape was wrapped around the belt at the latch plate to prevent webbing transfer before the test. The dummy was pushed back into the seat before the retractor was locked to remove slack from the shoulder belt. This configuration would minimize upper torso rotation and translation, but would allow lower torso motion to enhance the probability of submarining. iii) Pre-submarined - The lap belt was positioned above the ASIS points of the pelvis and was cinched to just contact the abdomen. The shoulder belt was cinched tight before the retractor was locked. This configuration ensured that submarining would occur because the lap belt started out in contact with the abdomen. Each test was run at 30mph using a sled pulse with a peak acceleration of 220g, as shown in Figure 10. A single small female Hybrid III dummy with or without the Frangible Abdomen was used in each test. The dummy instrumentation was used to make the following measurements: - head acceleration (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical) - neck force (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical) - neck moment (about longitudinal, lateral, and vertical axes) - chest acceleration (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical) - chest deflection (using a string potentiometer) - pelvis acceleration (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical) - pelvis rotation (5 inline accelerometers) - femur load (in right and left femur) There were 3 experiments for each belt and dummy configuration. The dummy configurations included the baseline small female Hybrid III dummy and the small female Hybrid III dummy modified to include the Frangible Abdomen. Note that chest compression in the baseline dummy was measured using a string potentiometer as in the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. There were 18 sled tests in total (2 dummy configurations * 3 belt configurations * 3 tests each). The data from these tests was taken using a high speed digital data acquisition system which samples each channel at 10,000 samples per second. The data was stored on a VAX 6220 computer for subsequent analysis. High speed movies were taken of each sled test for comparison of dummy kinematics. The motion of the head, H-point, and knee was tracked in the sagittal plane of the dummy for each test. In addition, the neck angle and torso angle were determined, for each test, at maximum head excursion and maximum torso excursion, respectively. KINEMATICS The kinematics of the dummy with and without the Frangible Abdomen were compared for the tests with each belt configuration. Installation of the Frangible Abdomen did not change the kinematics either qualitatively or quantitatively. A qualitative description of the kinematics follows. The quantitative analysis included comparison of maximum horizontal and vertical excursion of the H-point and head target, torso angle at maximum torso excursion, neck angle at maximum head excursion, time of submarining, time of rearward torso rotation, and time of knee contact with the front structure of the sled buck. Tables summarizing the quantitative data can be found in Appendix III. NO SUBMARINING - Kinematics of the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen were the same as those of the baseline dummy. The dummy translated forward in an upright position, with a constant torso angle relative to the vertical, until the lap belt caught the pelvis and began to restrain it. As pelvic restraint began, the belt stayed low on the pelvis and the torso rotated forward until shoulder belt restraint began. The feet of the dummy loaded the two Styrofoam blocks which comprised the sled fixture toe pan, but the knees of the dummy did not contact the front structures of the sled buck when there was no submarining. At maximum head excursion there was a slight twist of the head and torso in a counter o.o ly** ^vy/Vwwv V r'J Ô -10.0 - 1 1 -15.0 - ļ r -20.0 1 1 1 1 1 " 1 1 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 Tim« (mi) Figure 10.

It is interesting to note that the side view close-up camera showed the lap belt roping while on the pelvis in one test. In belt roping, the belt curls up and presents a rope-like loading surface instead of the usual flat and wide loading surface. DYNAMIC SUBMARINING - Kinematics of the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen were the same as those of the baseline dummy. The dummy translated forward in an upright position, with a constant torso angle relative to the vertical. The dummy initially moved forward with no torso rotation. The belt started out in contact with the pelvis beneath the ASIS points. As soon as the belt began to tighten, it started to migrate up the pelvic spine until it snapped over the ASIS points at 85-88ms, in the baseline tests and 84-96ms in the tests with the Frangible Abdomen. Submarining occurred just before knee contact with the front structures of the sled buck, while the dummy was in an upright position. The maximum abdominal penetration appeared to be at ^11 2ms when rotation about the lap belt began as evidenced by rearward rotation of the torso and forward translation of the pelvis. There was never any forward rotation of the torso (flexion). PRE-SUBMARINED - Kinematics of the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen were the same as those of the baseline dummy. The dummy translated forward in an upright position, with a constant torso angle relative to the vertical. At s62ms penetration of the belt into the abdomen began. At 2102ms body began to rotate around the belt while the H-point continued forward (this may have been the time of maximum belt penetration and coincided with a second peak in the belt load which occurred after the initiation of submarining). Knee contact with the front structures of the sled buck occurred at 2i07ms, which also coincides with a maximum in head longitudinal acceleration. Head-to-seat back contact occurred at 2 154ms, and the dummy came to rest on its back looking up at the ceiling. Belt penetration began in a direction perpendicular to the abdomen, but the dummy rotated around the lap belt so that the final belt angle was about 30° off the z-axis of the dummy's upper torso in an upward direction. In summary, there were no significant differences between kinematics of the baseline dummy and the kinematics of the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen, for any configuration tested. DYNAMICS The dynamic data from the dummy with and without the Frangible Abdomen were compared for the tests with each belt configuration. Some of the responses were different in the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. The analysis included comparison of head accelerations, neck forces and moments, chest accelerations and displacements, pelvis acceleration and rotation, femur loads, and crush of the Frangible Abdomen. Tables summarizing the dynamic data are presented in Appendix III. NO SUBMARINING - There were differences between the vertical head acceleration, lateral neck force, and vertical neck force in the baseline dummy when compared with those values for the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. The magnitudes of those 3 responses were greater in the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen than those in the baseline dummy (significant at the .05 level). There were no other significant differences. DYNAMIC SUBMARINING - The chest displacement in the baseline dummy was different from that in the dummy with Frangible Abdomen at the .05 level of significance. There were no other significant differences. PRE-SUBMARINED - There were differences between the longitudinal head acceleration, the lateral head acceleration, HIC, longitudinal neck force, vertical neck force, and vertical pelvis acceleration in the baseline dummy when compared to the dummy with Frangible Abdomen (significant at the .05 level). In all of these measurements except the lateral head acceleration and the vertical pelvis acceleration, the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen had lower values than the baseline dummy. There were no other significant differences. ASSESSMENT OF THE OCCURRENCE OF SUBMARINING Photographs of the Frangible Abdomen inserts after the sled experiments are shown in Figure 11. The inserts from the pre-submarined experiments show the most deformation, those from the dynamic submarining experiments show less deformation, and those from the experiments without submarining show the least deformation. SUBMARINING - Lap belt submarining leaves a clear impression on the frangible abdomen foam insert (Figure 11a,b). The location, area, and depth of the deformation are indicators of the extent of the submarining. For example, one side of the foam may be crushed in case of unilateral (one-sided) submarining. In such a case, a front view of the foam will show a diagonal crush pattern, with the depth of penetration increasing from the non-submarined side of the pelvis to the submarined side. Alternatively, there can be bilateral submarining in which the crush pattern extends from one side of the foam to the other, and the crush is entirely above the anterior- 1768</page><page sequence="10">Figure 11a.

The pattern of deformation can be as wide as the belt, or it can be narrow if the belt "ropes" (curls up) during the submarining event. NO SUBMARINING - When there is no submarining, there can still be some crush of the foam insert (Figure 11c). The location and character of the crushed foam is the key to making a determination as to the occurrence of submarining. When submarining has not occurred, the crush appears as a 5 cm wide flattened zone along the bottom of the front portion of the foam insert mainly below the anterior-superior iliac spines of the pelvis. This occurs because, as in the human being, the abdomen of the dummy extends beyond the spines of the pelvis (see Figure 12). Then when the lap belt tightens up in a collision, even though it is located correctly on the pelvis, it does compress the abdomen. This compression however, is low on the pelvis, is limited by the pelvic spines, and is probably not a source of injury. In the tests with no submarining, we observed deformation on the top surface of the foam insert. This deformation was caused by the lower rib of the dummy as the dummy torso flexed forward, and was typically 1/2" (12mm) deep at its maximum, with some deformation on each point.

We also made the following observations: • The crush was on the bottom half of the foam mainly below the anterior-superior iliac spines. • Only the middle point and major side points were crushed (not either of the minor side points). • The crush pattern was flat in profile (not round like a roped belt, not like a crevice made by a belt edge digging into the foam). • The crush pattern was horizontal in front view, and about the same size as the belt width. In some cases without submarining, deformation of the foam may occur from loading by the buckle or shoulder belt. A careful evaluation of the pattern of the crushed foam will allow the user to determine whether the crush is due to submarining, one of these other factors, or both. DETERMINATION OF THE RISK OF INJURY It is well known that the stiffness of the human abdomen is dependent on the velocity of loading. Experiments have shown that shoulder belt loading of the thorax is a low velocity event (about 3.3 m/s) [4], The Frangible Abdomen has been designed to represent the stiffness of the human abdomen in this velocity range. Experiments performed by Miller using live anesthetized porcine subjects [11], have shown that, in low velocity loading by belts (v &lt; 5 m/s), the maximum compression of the abdomen is correlated to the severity of abdominal injury. Miller used several physical parameters as the dose variable in a logistic regression dose-response model with injury severity of AIS &gt; 3 or 4 as the response variable. The logistic regression analysis on the belt loading data from those experiments was used as the basis for tables of foam crush versus risk of injury. Maximum compression was chosen as the appropriate injury criterion for the Frangible Abdomen because in the low velocity regime of belt loading, the injury is probably not caused by a viscous or inertial mechanism. The compression data was given as a percentage of the external dimensions of the subjects so it did not need to be scaled. The percent compression was multiplied by the mid-sized male and small female dimensions to determine the associated values of crush of the Frangible Abdomen for the central and major side points. These values were corrected for the effects of foam restitution (experiments have shown that the foam springs back slightly after being crushed [10] and the amount of restitution increases linearly as the crush depth increases). The results presented in Tables 1-4, for the mid-sized male and small female, demonstrate the increased risk of injury associated with increased penetration of the abdomen by a safety belt. Figures 13 and 14 present the data on foam crush versus risk of injury in a different format for easier use. The anthropometric data for the external abdominal dimension is from the UMTRI study on seated anthropometry [14]. The abdominal depth was used in the equation below to determine the percent compression as a function of the amount of foam crushed using the Frangible Abdomen.: Crush + Rest. Corr. Fact. Compression = Abdominal Depth where, Rest. Corr. Fact. = correction to account for restitution of the foam. In theory, to determine the risk of injury when submarining has occurred, the depth of crush of the Frangible Abdomen foam insert must be measured and compared to the appropriate table. In practice, we used outside calipers to measure the depth of foam remaining (the depth of foam that has not been crushed), called the "remaining thickness", given in the first column of the tables. The remaining thickness is converted to the amount of foam crushed and the corresponding compression in the second and third columns, respectively. The measurement of crush was made along the centerline of the point being measured (not perpendicular to the back of the foam insert) because it was assumed that the belt wraps around the circumference of the abdomen as submarining occurs. Then, the force from the belt would be directed radially in toward the spine. The amount of crush was measured for the central point and both major side points, and the risk of injury was determined for each. The reason for the different tables is that although the risk of injury depends only on the amount of crush, the remaining thickness of foam measured is a function of the length of the points which is different for the central point compared to the side points. The probability of AIS ¿3 or AIS ¿ 4 abdominal injury as determined from logistic regression of the Miller data is listed in the last two columns. For example, if the left major side point of a small female dummy has been crushed 3.0", the central point 3.5", and the right major side point 4.0", the probability of AIS ì. 4 injury would be 18%, 49%, and 78%, respectively (from Tables 1&amp;2). The probability of abdominal injury in the given sled test would then be given by the maximum of these three values (78%). The risk of occupant injury was measured from each Frangible Abdomen used in these sled experiments and is given in Table 5. In this Table, only the maximum risk of injury is given.

DISCUSSION KINEMATIC ANALYSIS - Figures 15a)-c) show graphically, to scale, the trend in H-point and head, maximum longitudinal and vertical excursion for the no submarining, dynamic submarining, and pre- submarined experiments. In these figures, the initial position of the head was placed at the head e.g., for simplicity. The straight lines which connect the initial and final positions of the head e.g. and H-point were drawn for ease of viewing and do not represent the trajectories of those targets. As the degree of submarining increases, the forward and upward motion of the h-point increases, but the forward and downward motion of the head, which is typical of non-submarining kinematics, decreases (i.e., the upper body does not move as far forward). These results agree with intuition and experience, and both the baseline small female Hybrid III and the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen exhibit the same pattern. In fact, there were no statistically significant differences in kinematic measures between the baseline dummy and the dummy with Frangible Abdomen in any of the experiments. Although not significant at the .05 level, in the pre-submarined experiments, there was near significance to the 1774</page><page sequence="16">vnnns~" heâd K'" I KNEE J ' + 100mm / N- H-POINT -100mm Figure 15a.

A similar relationship was shown in the Frangible Abdomen tests for the 50th percentile Hybrid III dummy [10], which may reflect a difference in the interaction of the lap belt with the abdomen. DYNAMIC ANALYSIS - There were some differences in the dynamic responses between the baseline dummy and the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. The differences in the no submarining cases were most likely due to contact between the steel plate on top of the lumbar spine and foam reaction plate and support bracket. The results in this report are for the original reaction plate design. When the lumbar spine contact was discovered the reaction plate was modified as shown in Figure 16. Recent tests with the new reaction plate have not shown any evidence of contact which should minimize or eliminate the few differences in the dynamic data. Most of the dynamic responses were unchanged in the other test configurations. The differences that were observed were probably due to changes in the way that the belt interacts with the abdomen which should be more realistic with the Frangible Abdomen since it has biofidelity. - HEA0 KNEE + 100mm / /+400mm * •-* ' X - H-POINT • 100mm Figure 15b.

Reaction plate and support bracket used in the validation sled tests (a &amp; b), compared with the reaction plate and support bracket after modifications to minimize contact with the lumbar spine (c &amp; d). For the no submarining case, there were differences in the vertical head accelerations, and in the lateral and vertical neck forces between the baseline dummy and the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen which were significant at the .05 level. In addition, while not significant at the .05 level, there were differences in HIC values between the baseline dummy and dummy with Frangible Abdomen and between tests with the same dummy (Appendix III). We believe the differences are the result of contact by the steel plate on top of the lumbar spine with the Frangible Abdomen reaction plate. The contact was evidenced after a number of tests were run as a dent in the ledge at the top of the reaction plate (Figure 16a) which keeps the foam from being pushed up into the dummy's chest. In addition to the physical marking, there were significant spikes in the vertical head acceleration, the vertical neck force, all three chest accelerations, and all three pelvis acceleration signals. The acceleration spikes were greatest in the vertical direction. These observations are consistent with the theory that the lumbar spine was making contact with the top of the reaction plate. We did not expect this contact in the dynamic submarining or in the pre- submarined experiments because the torso does not flex (rotate forward) in those experiments. The pelvis may rotate backwards far enough to cause contact, but the forces involved in that interaction should be much lower than those involved when the upper torso of the dummy is abruptly stopped by the contact. Modifications were made to the reaction plate and support bracket to eliminate or reduce this contact (Figure 16). In particular, the height of the reaction plate was reduced in the region of possible contact by 15.9mm (5/8"), and the ledge on the reaction plate was replaced by two tabs (Figure 16b), placed as far apart as possible to reduce the possibility of contact with the thoracic/lumbar junction. In addition, the wings of the support bracket were widened to clear the area between the lumbar spine and reaction plate of any possible obstructions (Figure I6c,d). The drawings in Appendix I (Figure 1. 2) are prints of the reaction plate and support bracket after the modifications. Recent tests with the modified hardware has shown no further evidence of contact which should reduce or eliminate the differences in the dynamic data. As already discussed, the kinematics, and in particular, the submarining performance of the small female dummy were not affected by the addition of the Frangible Abdomen. 1776</page><page sequence="18">In the dynamic submarining experiments, the chest compression was greater for the baseline dummy than for the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. One possible explanation for this difference could be that the Styrofoam abdomen restricts the motion of the rib cage. Since the dummy torso never flexed forward in the dynamic submarining tests, there should not have been any interaction of the foam with the rib cage unless the pelvis rotated backwards enough to allow the foam to get into the chest cavity. There was no evidence of that on the foam, but there were markings on the top of the foam inserts indicating some minimal contact with the lower rib of the dummy. Another possible explanation for the difference in chest compression is that the mechanical interaction of the belt with the abdomen has changed (presumably it is more realistic owing to the biofidelity of the abdomen). In the baseline Hybrid III, the gut sack was made of vinyl covered foam which probably does not capture the lap belt. In contrast, the Styrofoam insert of the Frangible Abdomen does capture the lap belt to a large extent if submarining occurs. Then, the belt in the baseline dummy may slip over the abdomen and penetrate further into the dummy. That could cause the shoulder belt to wrap around the rib cage in a much different way than in the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen, and may be the cause of the increased compression. Chest compression was the only parameter, in the dynamic submarining experiments, which exhibited a significant difference between the baseline dummy and the dummy with a Frangible Abdomen. In the pre-submarined configuration, the longitudinal head acceleration and neck force, vertical neck force, and HIC all decreased in the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. One possible explanation for the decrease in these parameters is again related to the difference in the composition of the abdominal elements of the dummies. In the baseline dummy, if the lap belt were to slip over the top of the vinyl covered abdomen, it would move unimpeded until it struck the lumbar or thoracic spine, at which point it would abruptly apply restraining force to the dummy. In comparison, the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen tends to catch the lap belt as the foam insert crushes during submarining. Then, the restraining force in the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen, would be applied more gradually, possibly leading to lower accelerations in the longitudinal direction. The reasons for the increased lateral head acceleration and vertical pelvis acceleration in the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen are not clear. FRANGIBLE ABDOMEN REPEATABILITY AND USABILITY - The Frangible Abdomen was simple to install and remove in the dummy, and did not affect turn around time for testing. In some tests, a section of foam, above the belt crush, broke off of one or two points. Even in those cases it was clear how far the belt had penetrated into the abdomen. One cause of the point breakage appeared to be loading by the lower rib of the rib cage possibly due to rearward rotation of the pelvis. This hypothesis is supported by the existence of: 1) tear lines on top of the foam which run parallel to the front surface of the chest, and are close to the back of the point; 2) marks from the lower rib on top of the foam point which are close to the tip of the point, 3) points of foam which are bent downward at the tip. The bending of the points apparently occurs after the belt crushes the Styrofoam. Belt crush probably weakens the points of the insert in the inferior/superior direction (up/down) by making them thin cantilevered beams. Then if lower rib contact occurs it causes bending with a moment arm equal to the distance from the point of rib contact to the point of maximum crush. Another cause of point breakage is motion of the lap belt itself. In two of the pre-submarined tests the belt caused the points to tear off the insert as it moved up the abdomen towards the ribs, ultimately completely transecting the foam. As seen in Table 5, the risk of injury in the 3 dynamic submarining experiments were very similar (± 7%). The risk of injury in the pre-submarined experiments had more variability (± 17%). The reason for the increased variability in the pre- submarined experiments unknown. MEASUREMENT OF THE AMOUNT OF CRUSH - The amount of crush is measured along the centerline of the central or major side points. The percent compression has been calculated assuming that the distance from the tip of the point to the back of the dummy is a constant for a given dummy size and choice of data base. Because the points are of different lengths, the crush must be measured at each point and converted to probability of injury before making a judgement as to the maximum injury potential. It is incorrect to assume that the point which has crushed the closest to the back of the foam insert has the maximum risk of injury. As seen in Tables 1- 4, the major side points have a lower risk of injury for the same amount of foam remaining uncrushed. Miller's data was obtained with a relatively flat loading by the belt because of the short length of belt used and the yoke loading arrangement. During submarining in a vehicle, the belt will probably tend to wrap around the occupant resulting in loading from the sides as well as from the front. It is not clear what effect this might have on the resulting injury. ANALYSIS METHOD - Using the injury risk curves in Figures 13 and 14, one can objectively compare different restraint systems using the Frangible Abdomen. If submarining occurs for a restraint system under development, the amount of crush 1777</page><page sequence="19">recorded from the Frangible Abdomen could be plotted right on a copy of the appropriate injury risk curve (Figure 17). Then after a design change and sled test, if submarining has recurred, the amount of crush can be recorded on the same graph. In this way, the Frangible Abdomen can give design direction, by graphically demonstrating the improvement or degradation in performance attributable to a specific change, and by showing the magnitude of the difference. The user should consider the minimum error band associated with the injury risk to be the risk corresponding to the recorded crush value ± 0.25" (6.4mm), based on the range of values mentioned above. INDETERMINATE RISK OF INJURY - We have observed one case, in the sled testing with the Frangible Abdomen, in which the submarining of the dummy was so severe that the belt ended up above the foam insert and hooked on the lower margin of the rib cage. As the dummy slipped under the belt there was significant deformation of the foam, but instead of a concentrated crush zone, a wavy fracture pattern appeared. Cases like this in which the dummy slips underneath the belt with a relative motion that is along the abdomen instead of into the abdomen, may result in an indeterminate risk of injury, but will still provide an indication of belt/abdomen interaction. Film analysis of the dummy kinematics, where available, can be used to supplement the Frangible Abdomen results in this situation. HANDLING - While not fragile, the Frangible Abdomen can be deformed during dummy placement in a sled fixture or barrier vehicle if precautions are not taken. Therefore, technical support personnel need to know that the purpose of the Frangible Abdomen is to measure crush of the foam. They should be cautioned to install the Frangible Abdomen in the dummy after it is placed in the test vehicle, and not to apply force to the abdominal area when handling the dummy to get the H-point in its proper location. APPLICABILITY - The Frangible Abdomen is a frontal impact test device, whose side impact properties are uncalibrated. It was designed for frontal impact tests involving a 3-point belt. Although it may also be applicable to lap belt-only systems, the Frangible Abdomen has not been tested with that belt configuration. The reaction plate contact in torso hyperflexion could be a major consideration in lap belt-only tests, because of the unrestricted motion of the upper torso. The reaction plate could possibly be modified to accommodate such testing, however, with a lap belt-only, the torso hyperflexion could result in shearing off of the front portion of the points. If submarining occurs it may or may not occur before interaction of the rib cage with the foam insert. 1 ! ! 1 ! 1 I ¡ 1 •» ! I ] -I - i - I- H ! M I I M 'M % / ' / ' - III!

The force-deflection corridor of the Frangible Abdomen represents the results of controlled low speed loading with a lap belt applied to anesthetized swine [11]. Since the human abdomen is rate sensitive, its stiffness increases in higher speed impacts such as those encountered by an unbelted occupant. However, since the Styrofoam Frangible Abdomen is not rate sensitive, its force-deflection response will not be stiff enough in unbelted dummy tests, and the resulting amount of crush will be an overestimate of what a human occupant would experience. Although the Frangible Abdomen would not be able to provide a precise risk of injury in those tests, it would still be useful as an indicator of contact by vehicle components and of the load distribution during that contact. INJURY RISK CURVES &amp; ANTHROPOMETRY - The choice of which anthropometric data to use can affect the injury risk curves because the injury risk may be a function of the posture of the occupant. The subjects in the experiments performed by Miller were tested in dorsal recumbency (on their backs) with the torso extended (in the anatomic sense). Then, the NASA data base discussed previously is a good representation of the external geometry of the subjects in these experiments, but possible differences in the position of the internal organs when comparing standing and supine subjects may reduce the quality of the representation. Similarly, typical vehicle occupants are neither standing, nor supine, but are seated. A number of changes occur in abdominal anthropometry while seated as compared with standing. When seated there is a relative sagging of the abdominal organs 1778</page><page sequence="20">because of their greater mobility than other body organs. The abdominal skin and subcutaneous tissue bulges forward as shown in the UMTRI study. Therefore, the UMTRI anthropometry is probably more representative of actual vehicle occupants in automotive seats (as it was intended to be). The decision to use the UMTRI anthropometric data affects the injury risk curve for the mid-sized male more than for the small female, because the male anthropometry was increased to a much larger extent when seated than the female anthropometry (28% versus 14% increase). SPINAL INJURY - One possible outcome of lap belt submarining is injury to the lumbar spine. Miller's tests do not provide a good model for spinal injury associated with submarining because the subjects were stationary and supine which prevented torso hyperflexion. Leung, et al. [7] have shown that spinal injury can occur with or without associated abdominal injury. Therefore, the risk determined by the Frangible Abdomen is for abdominal organs and does not account for injury to the spine. BELT "ROPING" - Lap belt "roping" occurred in the sled tests, but probably not in Miller's tests in which the belt length was short in comparison to a standard belt, and the attachment to the yoke prevented the ends from roping. It is not clear what effect this might have on the test results. Since a roped belt presents a much smaller cross-sectional area to the abdomen, it may have penetrated more easily due to higher pressure (same force over smaller area). This is dependent upon when the belt actually does rope. Roping may occur as the belt penetrates or before penetration begins. In addition, a roped belt may result in injuries, tolerances, or both injuries and tolerances that are different from those due to submarining with a flat belt. In either case, the Frangible Abdomen should be more compliant if the belt ropes, and will therefore present a more conservative estimate of injury risk. UNILATERAL SUBMARINING - When submarining occurs only on one side of the dummy, it is possible that the risk of injury is less than if the submarining was across the entire abdomen. This is because the mechanism of injury in submarining may involve pinching or crushing of the abdominal organs between the lap belt and lumbar spine with a resultant increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Since submarining is a low velocity event, it is unlikely that inertial or viscous mechanisms predominate. In unilateral submarining, the organs may be pushed backwards, but may not be pinched or crushed against the lumbar spine with the same amount of force as in bilateral submarining since the lumbar spine is along the midline of the body, and the load is being shared by one iliac spine (a pelvic "wing"). Alternatively, since the belt is in tension and it is around the circumference of the dummy abdomen, there will be components of force directed toward the lumbar spine at each point of belt contact on the submarined side. Since we do not currently have any biomechanical data which examines this question, a conservative approach would be to assume that the risk of injury when submarining occurs on one side is the same as in the case of submarining across the entire abdomen, i.e., determined by the maximum crush of any point. SUMMARY The Frangible Abdomen is a Styrofoam insert for the abdominal region of the Hybrid III family of dummies which has biofidelity, and assesses the occurrence of submarining and its risk of injury. It is easy to install and use, and provides an objective assessment of belt restraint submarining performance. It was first developed for the mid-sized male Hybrid III dummy. This paper describes the design of the Frangible Abdomen for the small female Hybrid III dummy, and how to use it to assess the risk of injury from submarining. The force-deflection properties of the mid-sized male insert were scaled to the small female dimension. Sled tests were run to compare the kinematic and dynamic performance of the baseline small female Hybrid III dummy with the same dummy modified to incorporate the Frangible Abdomen. No significant kinematic differences exist, either qualitatively or quantitatively, between the baseline dummy and the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. The dynamic responses of the dummy with the prototype Frangible Abdomen differed in some cases from those of the baseline dummy. The differences were traced to contact between the steel plate on top of the lumbar spine and the steel reaction plate and support bracket for the styrofoam insert. The Frangible Abdomen hardware as specified in the mechanical drawings in Appendix I is a design which was modified to reduce possible interferences. The modifications made to the reaction plate and support bracket should make the dynamic performance of the dummy with the Frangible Abdomen much closer to the baseline dummy since further limited testing has shown the elimination of contact. More importantly, the kinematic and submarining performance of the small female Hybrid III dummy is unchanged by the addition of the Frangible Abdomen. Injury assessment with the Frangible Abdomen is achieved by comparing the depth of foam deformation to tables provided which relate the risk of injury to the amount of crush. 1779</page><page sequence="21">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Gerald Horn, Timothy Sorenson, Todd Townsend, and Frank Wood for technical assistance during these tests.

The chest and pelvis should be decoupled. The chest deflection potentiometer must be removed and its mounting bracket modified. The bracket should be weighed before and after the modification so that the dummy can be reballasted to account for the change in weight. The bracket modification is achieved by sawing off the front part (the part with the rubber chest stops) so that the remaining bracket is flush with the front surface of the lumbar spine top mounting plate (Figure 1.4). After modification, additional mass can be added to the thoracic spine ballast mass to account for the weight change due to bracket modification. The bracket and ballast mass can be reattached to the thoracic spine. The lumbar spine and its mounting block should be removed from the pelvis, and the lumbar spine detached from the mounting block. For the 50th percentile male dummy, the support bracket (Figure 1.5) which couples the abdomen to the pelvis, can then be attached to the modified lumbar spine block. For the 5th percentile female dummy, the support bracket and lumbar spine mounting block are a single piece (Figure 4). Finally, the foam reaction plate (Figure 4 for the small female, and Figure 1.5 for the mid-sized male) is bolted to the support bracket, and the thoracic spine is attached to the lumbar spine. The modified lumbar spine block also causes a change in weight of the dummy. This difference should be determined and the dummy mass reballasted before using the dummy. There are two support bracket designs that have been used with the Frangible Abdomen for the 50th percentile male dummy. Both of them add 1/4" in height to the dummy. Because the original design raises the lumbar spine mounting block 1/4", the standard wrench for setting the pelvis angle through the side of the pelvis cannot be used. The design was modified as shown in Figure 1. 5 to allow the use of the wrench. If the pelvis angle can be set using an alternative method, either design can be used. The Hybrid III dummy manufacturer, is currently considering manufacturing a support bracket pre- molded into the lumbar spine mounting block for the mid-sized male. This should simplify the installation procedure, remove the 1/4" height that was added to the dummy by the original support bracket, and allow the pelvis angle to be set using standard tools. The 5th percentile female dummy height is not changed by its support bracket/lumbar spine mounting block design. INSTALLATION OF THE FOAM INSERT The dummy should be placed in the vehicle or sled buck to be tested before the foam installation begins. If possible, the dummy should be suspended approximately 10cm above the seat using the lifting ring which screws into the top of its head. Suspending the dummy by the lifting ring allows the weight of the legs to cause extension of the torso (the anatomic meaning of extension - i.e., the angle between the chest and the femurs increases). Torso extension facilitates the installation, which is readily accomplished by two people. The first person grasps the vinyl "skin" on the front of the dummy pelvis, and pulls it forward and down to expose as much of the abdominal cavity as possible. The second person holds the foam insert in one hand by the middle point. The foam is tilted backwards (the front of the insert is higher than the back of the insert), and pushed carefully into the pelvis. The back of the insert should fit beneath the tabs on the foam reaction plate which is attached to the dummy pelvis. The fit is designed to be snug so that the tabs prevent the foam insert from being pushed into the thoracic cavity during a sled test. Care should be taken as the foam is pushed into the pelvis. The force should be applied using the finger tips by grasping the foam as close to the back of the insert as possible. The force should not be directed against the front part of the foam points. Once the foam insert is in place, the vinyl chest "skin" can be carefully guided back to its original position. Removal of the foam insert occurs by reversing the steps above. If submarining occurs, the belt should be cut on either side of the insert and, where possible, left in the foam until the insert has been removed from the dummy. This will reduce the possibility of altering the foam deformation pattern after the test. APPENDIX II - CALIBRATION OF STYROFOAM When a new billet of styrofoam is obtained a few samples should be tested using the cube test method outlined previously, and the force-deflection should be compared to the corridor of Figure 9. If the force- deflection is within the established corridor, then this material property is the same as the Styrofoam used in our Frangible Abdomen development, indicating that inserts made from that billet should have the proper stiffness. If the force-deflection is outside of the desired corridor, we recommend testing one insert sample cut from the correct orientation as in Figure 6. The insert is cut on a band saw. Since the force- deflection is insensitive to small cutting variations, variation of ±2.5 mm (.10") in the point thickness is acceptable. The original force-deflection curves for the porcine subjects were determined using a hydraulic testing machine (MTS) [10,1 1].

The force recorded was the axial load on the subject recorded by the load cell. The deflection recorded was the piston displacement, not the measured displacement of the subject's abdomen. The actual deflection of the subject may have been different from the piston displacement because seat belt material stretches during loading. However, the procedure used to determine the human/porcine force-deflection corridors was also used to test the force-deflection of the Styrofoam. It was assumed that the belt stretch is similar in the two test conditions, and therefore, that the force-deflection properties desired could be matched using this technique. If testing of the newly cut insert reveals force- deflection properties outside of the desired corridor (Figure 11.1 and II. 2), then the shape of the template may have to be adjusted, or a different billet of Styrofoam used. Major adjustment of the size of the points as described below may affect the performance of the inserts, but minor adjustments may be tolerable. To "soften" the curve, the middle 3 points should be made thinner. To "stiffen" the curve, the middle 3 points should be made thicker. The points can be made thinner or thicker in 1/8 inch increments until the stiffness is matched. The resulting pattern can then be used for all inserts made from the same billet.

Note that the maximum head excursion was defined here as the maximum forward motion of the head target. In most cases the head continued rotating for another 2-4ms, which encompassed vertical motion and some slight rearward motion as the neck hyperflexed.

Each table represents a different submarining configuration, and compares the data for the baseline small female Hybrid III dummy to the small female Hybrid III dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. GRAPHS - Figures III . 1 -II 1 .3 show typical belt loads, and resultant head, chest, and pelvic accelerations for sled tests which used the small female dummy with the Frangible Abdomen. The graphs represent one typical test from each submarining configuration. TABLE 111.4 DYNAMIC ANALYSIS NO SUBMARINING Parameter Baseline Dummy with Sign.
