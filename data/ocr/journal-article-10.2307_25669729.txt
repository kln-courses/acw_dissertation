This unusual placement and evidence for periodic flooding raise questions about site use. Traditional models for Hopewell settlement in the East suggest that regional exchange centers were placed in such precarious locations to facilitate the movement of trade goods along major waterways. More recent models focus on "sacred landscapes" and the necessity of periodic aggregation among middle range societies. The present study exam ines the possibility that the Aker site played a role in one of these systems, with particular reference to the site's lithic assemblage. Keywords: Kansas City Hopewell; Middle Woodland; lithic typing; exchange; ritual aggregation. The Woodland period saw many changes in the lifeways of prehistoric Americans including shifting subsistence strategies. As these lifeways changed, some populations expanded rapidly and formed large networks of exchange and communi cation. Around the middle of this period, cultures resembling that of the Hopewell in the eastern United States appear in the Kansas City area. Settlement patterns for the Kansas City area mani festation of Hopewell life also tend to mimic those in the East. A notable deviation from the standard pattern is the Aker site (23PL43), a large village near the confluence of the Missouri and Platte riv ers in Platte County, Missouri. The site is on the Missouri floodplain where it was exposed to peri odic flooding. Such anomalies also occur in the Illinois River valley (e.g. Moundhouse). Struever (1968) suggested that they functioned as regional exchange centers taking advantage of proximity to the river for transportation of various trade goods including lithic materials. More recently, these sites have been viewed as ceremonial gathering places or segregated districts of a wealthy artisan class (Buikstra et al. 1998:10-14). This study examines the lithic collection from the Aker site to test these hypotheses and attempts to describe the nature of whatever exchange may have occurred there. CULTURAL CONTEXT AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Researchers debate the use of the term Hopewell. One view suggests that Hopewell sites were inhabited by members of a single culture system. Others argue that these are simply autono mous communities with common ties to a broad exchange network known as the Hopewell Interaction Sphere (e.g. Seeman 1995). Such theo retical issues as the criteria on which one bases cultural affiliation are outside the scope of the cur rent study. Here, the term will be used to refer to any site exhibiting consistent contact with the Hopewell Interaction Sphere in the form of charac teristic artifact styles, raw materials or features such as stone-lined burial mounds. Struever (1964) sums up this view by defin ing Hopewell as a set of regionally distinct culture systems sharing common artifact styles and exotic materials in the central United States between about 100 BC and AD 350. Some hierarchies may have been present within the larger system, specifically in the Illinois and Ohio river valleys, but they were not necessarily dependent upon one another. He further suggests that analysis may show that raw materials and stylistic concepts rather than finished Daniel C.

Seeman (1995) has also shown that ideologi cal elements were at least as important as material goods in Hopewell exchange. In pre-market sys tems, economic activities are often so deeply embedded within the broader social system that exchanged materials are secondary in importance to the act of maintaining relationships and trans ferring information (cf. Herskovits 1952; Sahlins 1974). The manifestations of these shared sys tems of social information at various points on a landscape allow us to track long-range trade net works, as we will investigate presently. Known Hopewell sites line the greater Mis sissippi River valley from the Great Lakes region into Louisiana and range from Ohio to central Kansas, although the westernmost of these tend to be small and relatively unknown. The Hopewell universe tends to be restricted to major waterways and tributaries south of the 140-day frost-free line. Hopewellian cultures appeared in the Woodland period, which experienced many changes in sub sistence and technology. Seasonal movement of hunter-gatherers focusing on large game and the collection of wild foodstuffs characterized the pre vious Archaic period. Archaic groups, such as those of the Nebo Hill tradition, required consider able sustaining territories for their semi-nomadic activities, including the beginnings of some ceramic technology and procurement and production of lithic resources for items such as large dart points. The shift to Woodland lifeways was marked by the refinement of pottery into large, often or nate, conoidal vessels. These were needed for storage and cooking as sedentism increased and subsistence shifted to smaller game, such as deer, fish and turtle, and a mudflat cultivation strategy focused on marshelder, amaranth and lambsquarter growing in backwater areas. The bow and arrow appeared in the Middle Woodland, and some re searchers have suggested that intensive agriculture appeared at the end of the sequence. This subsis tence shift led to increased sedentism and smaller sustaining zones. It also, however, accelerated ex pansion and increased population pressure. The population pressure model for Hopewell expansion (Struever 1964) states that a cultural disequilibrium was occasionally created, leading to fission and the creation of daughter communi ties. These moved up the waterways that anchored the parent settlements. Reduced contact with the central group and cultural drift in such situations generally leads to an increase in cultural and sty listic differentiation. Struever (1964) states that this led to more extensive "style zones" that ultimately created and expanded the Hopewell In teraction Sphere within the greater Midwest. KANSAS CITY HOPEWELL Wedel (1943) identified the existence of a cul tural complex known as Kansas City Hopewell (KCH) based on work by Shippee and himself at the Renner site (14PL1). This demonstrated simi larities between Kansas City area Middle and Late Woodland sites and Illinois Hopewell sites. As the fissioning process described above continued in the Illinois River valley, daughter communities be gan to push the periphery of Hopewell territory west into the Missouri River valley (Johnson 1978). Middle Woodland sites showing evidence for contact with the Hopewell Interaction Sphere appear in the Kansas City vicinity around 100 BC. It was once thought that this expansion was based on an emerging agricultural economy fo cused on maize production in Illinois (e.g. Cutler and Blake 1969). Most evidence of maize agri culture during the Woodland in the Midwest has proven inconclusive, and the amount of corn and squash in KCH contexts is scant (Wedel 1943; E. Johnson 1975; Bell 1976). All evidence seems to suggest that the Kansas City area during the Middle Woodland was inhabited by hunter-gatherers prac ticing a moderate level of horticulture that increased over time. KCH sites are found primarily along the east side of the Missouri River and its major tributar ies between St. Joseph, Missouri and its confluence with the Kansas River in Kansas City. Assuming that the landscape of this area looked the same during the Woodland period as it did in the mid-nineteenth century, oak-hickory forest corridors dominated it. The traditional placement of KCH settlements along the bluff line of the Missouri River valley provided ready access to five of the six major resource zones identified by Johnson (1978): the Missouri River, the floodplain forest of the Missouri River, floodplain prairies, 270</page><page sequence="3">Daniel C. Pugh The Aker Site (23PL43) tributary forests, and slope-upland oak-hickory forests. The sixth zone identified is upland prairies, typically several km away from KCH sites. Resource diversity was important to these populations as population pressures increased. Diversification offset the impact of a natural disaster or a bad year, thus precluding the use of a single procurement area. KANSAS CITY HOPEWELL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS Hopewell sites throughout the United States have generally been classified in a three-part sys tem. Sites in the Kansas City area appear to fit well within this system. Under the model, large villages (usually three to six acres), marked by intensive, prolonged occupation and high activity levels, are found on terrace remnants along the bluff line of the Missouri River at points where tributaries feed it. Terrace remnants seem to have been chosen for the dual advantages of providing ready access to several resource zones and providing sufficient elevation to avoid flood. No tably, however, Woodland era settlements in this area tend to be significantly lower than those from previous periods in the same area, on average 23 m lower than Late Archaic Nebo Hill villages (Johnson 1978). Although this shift may have been in response to a drop in water levels, it more likely reflects a shift in lifeways at the Archaic-Woodland transition. While maintaining sufficient elevation, KCH people seem to demonstrate a preference for sites allowing ready access to the streams. These villages are spaced fairly evenly along the river, allowing for estimated sustaining territories of ap proximately 15 to 35 square miles (Johnson 1976). Following the tributaries higher into the bluffs, smaller and more ephemeral campsites are found with significantly lower activity diversity. These are thought to be seasonal hunting and resource procurement sites. The third type of KCH site, burial mounds consisting of stone vaults covered in earth, are found on top of bluffs near the large villages. Al though approximately 45 of these mounds are known between Kansas City and St. Joseph, prob ably many more are undiscovered. Unfortunately, many of the known mounds have been looted and vandalized, and it is probable that a significant num ber of other mounds have been destroyed, either by looting or unintentionally by development or agriculture. In fact, much of the KCH territory is now under the pavement of greater Kansas City and St. Joseph, and the territory that remains in rural areas has largely been modified for agricul ture. Campsites are not as obvious on the landscape as mounds. Only eight such sites are currently known. With one exception, all the campsites iden tified as KCH were found along Brush Creek in a survey led by A. E. Johnson in 1971 (Johnson 1974). Survey of other tributaries would certainly produce more campsites, but for now the number is limited. Eight KCH villages are currently known in the lower Missouri valley. In contrast to the campsites, it seems reasonable to assume, based on spacing and size, that no more remain to be found. THE AKER SITE Among the known KCH villages is the Aker site (23PL43), located at the confluence of the Missouri and Platte rivers. The site was originally discovered by avocational archaeologist R. B. Aker, who collected artifacts from the surface and engaged in some small, independent excavations of trash-filled storage pits. In the summer of 1975, a University of Kansas and Kansas State Univer sity joint field school focused on a very large pile of limestone hearth debris. The site dates between ca. AD 650 and 1100, which is fairly late for KCH and certainly for Hopewell in the greater Midwest, but well within the local Hopewellian sequence. If these dates are accurate, the Hopewell Interac tion Sphere as recognized by individuals like Struever as an elaborate system of intense ex change in exotic and prestige goods had long since vanished from the east-central US. In fact, the Emergent Mississippian period had begun in the American Bottom by AD 750. The Aker site is by far the largest KCH site in surface area. Artifact distribution suggests that the site occupied over 15 acres, more than twice the extent of the next largest village, the Renner site (23PL1), and had an estimated sustaining terri tory of 51 square miles. Soil phosphate analysis suggests a smaller size (Johnson 1978), but size estimates for all other villages, except the Young site (23PL4) (Zabel 1976), are based on artifact dis tribution, and phosphate studies do not change 271</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 46, No. 177, 2001 the enormous sustaining territory. As mentioned above, the most unusual characteristic of the Aker site is that it is placed well below the bluff and terrace lines on the floodplain of the Missouri River, defying the traditional model. In fact, evidence at the Aker site for silting during occupation (Johnson 1978) points to the model's rationale of avoiding floods by settling in the uplands. ECONOMICS AND THE KANSAS CITY HOPEWELL The fact that occupation continued at the Aker site after the hazards of flooding had been dem onstrated indicates that something about the site tipped the cost-benefit scale enough to offset this cost. Struever (1968) investigated Mound House, a Hopewell site in the valley of the Illinois River in a similarly precarious location. Like the Aker site, Mound House is characterized as a perma nent village, complete with storage pits and hearths. At Aker, however, silting clearly occurred during occupation (Mori 1967; Pullen 1976), calling its characterization as "permanent" into question. Struever suggests that the Mound House village was indeed occupied over a long period but was still seasonal and special-purpose. The purpose of occupation, he argues, was exchange. He devel ops a model of "regional exchange centers," placed in locations offering easy access to major water ways such that they may act as trading ports. Exotic goods come in and are in turn redistributed to the other villages up the streams and tributaries. Buikstra et al. (1998:10-12) systematically deconstruct this model as applied to Mound House and suggest that it is generally unreliable. Instead, they suggest that river bottom sites may have been "sacred landscapes" used as ritual aggregation loci (Buikstra et al. 1998: 94). Johnson (1978) has suggested that the Aker site may fit into Struever's model as a regional exchange center for the lower Missouri River valley. This model is complicated by the elusive question of the exact role that KCH played in the Hopewell Interaction Sphere. A general paucity of traditional interaction sphere goods in the total KCH assem blage (n=14) has led some to suggest that KCH in fact existed entirely outside of this network. How ever, goods traditionally associated with Hopewell interaction in the East tend to appear most fre quently in burial contexts and are thought to be status-related objects. Given that no undisturbed burial sites have been professionally excavated in the KCH area, this paucity of exchange goods could be the result of statistical bias. Johnson (1978) dis putes this by citing newspaper accounts describ ing the original opening of some of the mounds. These make no reference to such status goods, which would certainly have caught the attention of any reporter due to their unusual and ornate na ture. Further, Struever (1964: 88) argues that such items "functioned in various ritual and social contexts within community life." Even though the ultimate destination of the interaction sphere goods may be interment, significant quantities appear in living areas of Hopewell sites to the east, broken, lost, or forgotten during their residence with the living. Thus, they would be expected to appear in similar contexts in the Kansas City locality. The possibilities raised more recently by Buikstra et al. (1998) as to the functioning of floodplain sites in the Hopewell world may make this a moot point. Though the nature of Hopewellian contact is contested, some contact was certainly maintained between Kansas City's Woodland inhabitants and groups to the east. This contact manifests itself in the form of conventions in ceramic techniques, other artifact styles and burial practices. Indeed, it is these persistent similarities that first led Wedel to assign these sites to the broader Hopewell nomenclature. Johnson (1978: 90) notes "although with a temporal lag, of as yet un determined duration, it is possible to observe the same general trends of stylistic change in both ceramics and the bifacial products of the chipped stone industries" of the Kansas City and eastern Hopewell. The KCH assemblage also contains 14 anthropomorphic figurines, five platform pipes, and hematite objects that resemble Hopewell In teraction Sphere goods. The raw materials used for nearly all of these have been identified as lo cal or probably local. While the paucity of esoteric trade goods and truly exotic materials may argue that KCH people were not engaging in direct long-distance trade of finished products or even raw material with people in the heart of Hopewell territory, the consistent manifestations of Hopewellian aesthetics and sty listic conventions must surely argue that some level 272</page><page sequence="5">Daniel C. Pugh The Aker Site (23PL43) of contact, direct or indirect, was maintained. Given Struever's de scription (1964) of an interaction sphere as a broad logistics network in which the transmission of ideas and cultural conventions is at least as important as the trade of material goods, there seems little question that the KCH was in fact part of an enormous interaction sphere, both early in the sequence (the Hopewell Interaction Sphere) and later, as rep resented at the Aker site. It also must be remembered that while KCH groups were not neces sarily involved in direct trade or communication with the Hopewell of the Illinois and Ohio rivers, they were not utilizing only local resources. Reid (1976) demonstrates that the Trowbridge site (14WY1) was involved in long-distance item specific trade. Forty-five percent of bladelets at this site are made from exotic chert, and they are statis tically similar in style to those found in the Big Bend area of central Missouri. Reid concludes that a trade relationship was in place to facilitate the movement of prepared cores and bladelets from east to west. In a similar study of bladelet technol ogy among Hopewell people in the Illinois Valley, Morrow (1987) argues that the uniformity of these artifacts and the privileging of exotic or high qual ity cherts in their manufacture reflects a role outside the purely technological world. It is also suggested that certain attributes of these objects carried in formation about social identity across regions of the Hopewell world and may have been "conspicu ously consumed" by some individuals or groups. Under the model of regional exchange centers, Trowbridge plays the role of a recipient community removed from most direct contact with outside trad ers. Therefore, it would certainly receive trade goods, as Reid demonstrates, but the quantity would only be as much as the village needed for its own use. Aker, however, plays the role of exchange center in this model, receiving shipments of ex change goods from downstream and distributing them to local consumers upriver and along the up stream tributaries. Thus, the site would be expected to have a disproportionately high amount of extralocal goods and materials in its assemblage. Mississippian ^rtiar^^ijP^ Quaternary Figure 1. Generalized map of available lithic resources for Kansas and Mis souri. Because material trade for the KCH generally is considered relatively unimportant, we might not expect large caches of exotic materials like those found in mounds at Hopewell sites in the Illinois valley such as Napoleon Hollow (Wiant and McGimsey 1986). However, procurement of exotic materials at a port city will always be relatively easy, so they should appear in significantly larger quan tities within the general community, and we should likewise expect some amount of warehousing if the role of long-distance procurement fits into a larger economic framework. This study examines the lithic collection from the Aker site statistically to explore whether the site was in fact such a regional ex change center or served some other purpose by its unusual location. The analysis also illuminates the nature and extent of lithic exchange there. GEOLOGIC SETTING OF THE KANSAS CITY HOPEWELL Before examining the lithic assemblage of the Aker site, it is important to understand its geologic setting and the issues facing procurement and use of resources near the village, as well as to identify exotic materials of potential significance to Aker's residents. The surface geology of western Missouri and eastern Kansas is predominantly Pennsylva nian in age (Figure 1). During the Pleistocene, portions of northern Missouri and Kansas were glaciated, and deposits of outwash and till material were utilized by many prehistoric groups in the Kansas City area. Such deposits were one source of hematite used by KCH people. Several problems arise in the identification of 273</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 46, No. 177, 2001 lithic materials here. Glacial and riverine deposits pose a problem in identifying the sources of mate rials in our collection, because time and water can transport useable stones from far away. Character istics of cortical pieces such as rounding and heavy patina may indicate a glacial or riverine source if nonlocal materials are encountered. The local Pennsylvanian chert types are often very difficult to distinguish from one another. Un doubtedly, development has covered or destroyed many sources that were available in prehistoric times, just as it has obscured many archaeological sites. Further, it is unlikely that all existing outcrops are known. As the geographic distribution of chert sources expands, our understanding of lithic vari ability also expands. This sometimes clarifies differences between types, but frequently points to variability within types that makes them difficult to distinguish. Several sources were helpful in developing the chert descriptions used here. Personal communi cation among individuals concerned with lithic studies is extremely important in keeping a given study current. The descriptions below rely heavily on personal communications with Janice McLean and Bert Wetherill, both involved in Missouri chert studies, as well as on the literature. The growing lithic comparative collection at the University of Kansas Museum of Anthropology (KUMA) was a third source of information, and many elements used to distinguish stone types come from personal ob servation. The characteristics used here to describe chert are texture (the size and homogeneity of par ticles within the stone), color (generally documented using the Munsell color series, but described here qualitatively), internal structure (the patterning of colors within the rock such as homogenous, mottled, layered and banded) and inclusions (the presence or absence of foreign mat ter within the silica matrix such as fossils of various types and mineral deposits). The Pennsylvanian cherts that crop out in Platte and surrounding counties in Missouri are formed in the Winterset, Westerville and Argen tine members of the Kansas City Group and the Spring Hill member of the Lansing Group (Reid 1980). Typical Winterset chert tends to be bluish gray, but may range from buff to gray and often approaches black. These colors are usually homog enous, but may be mottled, layered or occasionally banded in a concentric pattern that resembles tree rings. Winterset chert exhibiting concentric bands has only been observed in very light brown to buff pieces, and the mottling tends to be very tight and in fairly thin layers. Inclusions frequently appear in the form of "abundant veins, vugs and laminae of bright white calcite" giving the chert a "zebra-like appearance" (Reid 1978). Small fossil inclusions are also common, but like mottles, they are characteris tically found in thin layers when dense. The texture of Winterset chert is generally smooth, but it grades into cortex, and grainy pieces are known. Westerville chert ranges from yellowish brown to light gray in color and would generally be described as buff. It too may be layered or mottled, but is most frequently homogenous. Reid (1978) notes that "rare thin bands of pure white, porcelaneous chert may occur" within Westerville deposits. Inclusions are rare, but some fossils, veins, calcite vugs and cavities have been noted. The texture of this type of chert ranges from smooth to chalky and this variability has been noted within single nodules. Other local Pennsylvanian cherts have been described, but are not distinguishable from each other at present. To avoid misidentification while maintaining some level of provenience control, they were placed in categories specific to this study. "Local Gray" simply refers to cherts be lieved to derive from one of the local types or nearby formations such as the Shawnee Group of eastern Kansas that are gray to light brown and relatively inclusion-free. The artifacts placed in this category range from fine to somewhat grainy in texture. Among the types in this category are the two types described above, as well as Toronto chert, which was often found to be identical to samples of Westerville chert in the KUMA comparative collection. A category labeled "Gray Fossiliferous" was also created to encompass local and near-local cherts that are currently impossible to distinguish when in small pieces. As the label implies, all of these cherts have significant quanti ties of fossil inclusions and tend to be gray to light brown. Many specimens are mottled or banded and textures fall within the same spectrum as those in the "Local Gray" category. This category encom passes fossiliferous Winterset, Bethany Falls, 274</page><page sequence="7">Daniel C. Pugh The Aker Site (23PL43) Argentine and Spring Hill cherts, among others. Permian materials crop out in the Flint Hills region of east-central Kansas, northeast Oklahoma and southeast Nebraska. Most of the Permian chert found in archaeological contexts in this region is formed in the Wreford and Barneston formations. Permian cherts will only be described generally for the present study as they tend to be extremely variable and difficult to distinguish on the type level. For our purposes, they are all extralocal. McLean (1998a) presents complete and thorough descriptions of these cherts. All of the Permian materials in the Aker collection likely fall into the Florence type, which can be divided into four sub types (A-D), but they have not been ascribed type status confidently. These materials tend to be notably finer grained than Pennsylvanian cherts, ranging from smooth to very smooth and nearly glassy. Colors within Permian cherts may vary, of ten along a spectrum of gray, with yellowish to dark brownish gray common. Fossil inclusions, typically fusulinids, are common and generally considerably larger than those found in Pennsyl vanian materials. Banding, often described as "wood-grained," appears in some pieces and gen erally presents a steady shift in color from darker bands on the outside to lighter ones on the inside. Mottles are fairly large and generally darker than the rest of the stone. Mississippian deposits are found in central Missouri and in areas along the Missouri River farther east. The name Burlington is used to refer to materials formed in several members of this age, frequently found in archaeological contexts. While Burlington chert is generally white or light gray, it can range into buff, and when heated, as these materials often are, a wide array of colors may be produced, including orange, red, pink and blue. Some Burlington chert is mottled, ranging from tight to broad in pattern. Texture is also extremely variable within Mississippian cherts, ranging from nearly glassy to chalky. The fossil content of these cherts is also variable, ranging from completely fossil-free over large nodules to an extremely dense packing of fossils with more inclusions than matrix. Fossiliferous Burlington is the only Mississippian chert that was typed with any confidence, based on large, intact sections of crinoid stems as large as 5-10 mm in diameter. Fusulinids are absent from Mississippian cherts (Reid 1984). The fossils in Burlington chert are generally incompletely silicified and fractures may be disrupted by their presence (see Morrow 1994 for descriptions of several Mississippian chert types). Farther east along the Missouri River and far ther south into the Ozark Mountains, Ordovician outcrops often resemble Mississippian materials. Ray (1981) provides detailed descriptions of Or dovician chert types from the Truman Reservoir area. However, in our experience, the variability of Ordovician cherts across the state is very high and they are often indistinguishable from Missis sippian types. The only conclusive difference is inclusions. The fossil makeup of Ordovician cherts is similar to that of Mississippian cherts, but the fossils are significantly smaller and fully silicified, such that fractures often carry through without any deviation. In this study, most cherts of Mississippian or Ordovician origin are consolidated into a single category, because they are currently extremely difficult to distinguish and all are considered ex otic with reference to the Aker site. An informal type of Mississippian and Ordovician chert created for this paper is known simply as "Homogenous White." This category includes items that are com pletely inclusion free and white throughout. Some of these artifacts have been heat-treated and ap pear light pink or orange, but the original color of the stone is apparent. All items in this category are very fine textured. Many pieces are unidentifiable at even the age level. This is often due to small size, poor quality or a high percentage of cortex. These artifacts are labeled "unknown age" to avoid contaminating the statistics with false data. Some specimens, how ever, are simply materials which do not fit into any of the above categories and are currently of unknown origin. ANALYSIS The lithic assemblage from the Aker site contains 917 pieces. These were individually num bered and coded. The categories used to describe the collection are category, type/portion, platform remnant bearing (PRB)/portion, material age, mate rial type, heat treatment, cortex and weight.

Category refers to artifact category and may include unmodified flake, bladelet, unmodified non-flake debris, core, modi fied flake, modified bladelet, biface/preform, drill, projectile point/knife (PPK), hafted scraper, uniden tifiable tool fragment and unidentifiable biface fragment (UBF). Type refers to the type of tool within certain categories. Modified flakes may be endscrapers, sidescrapers, end-side scrapers, knives, gravers, notches, composites, unidentifi able scraper fragments or other. Modified bladelets are subdivided by retouch type as dis continuous, side, notched, end and end-side. Finally, the biface preform category breaks into two types, early/intermediate stage and late stage. For the categories of drill, PPK and hafted scraper, this coding column is used to record portion. PRB is simply recorded as "yes" or "no" and indicates whether any trace of the original platform remains. Material age and type refer to the geologic age and chert member of the material whenever known and includes the types described above. Heat treat ment is recorded as "yes" or "no," and the type of evidence indicating heat treatment (i.e. color, blackening, crazing) is noted. Cortex is divided into three possible codes indicating the amount of cor tex covering the dorsal surface of an artifact. Weight is recorded to the nearest 0.1 g using an electronic scale. Flakes make up the bulk of the collection (n=742). There are also 14 blades, one modified blade, 18 cores, two drills, 12 modified flakes, 24 3000 -, yrjn weight ^ ot o &amp; &gt; p c Figure 3. Distribution of artifacts by material age. PPKs, 13 biface/preforms, four UBFs, 81 pieces of unmodified non-flake debris and two unidentifiable tool fragments (Figure 2). Pennsylvanian-aged cherts included 526 artifacts for a total of 2850.8 g, while Mississippian and Ordovician materials ac count for 168 pieces at 398.3 g. Only 25 artifacts are Permian, totaling 105.6 g. Some 189 artifacts, weigh ing 584.1 g, were deemed unidentifiable. Nine are either Permian or Winterset type, Pennsylvanian aged chert, weighing 12 g (Figure 3). Of pieces coded for PRB, 483 are positive and 285 show no remnant of a platform. Only 213 pieces show evidence of thermal alteration, leaving 704 unheated. Some 514 pieces are completely non-cortical, while 289 retain less than 50% cortex, and 114 are more than 50% cortical. Of the 719 pieces whose material age could be positively identified, 193 are exotic, making up 25% of the total collection. This suggests that some amount of long-distance procurement was occurring at the site. Further, 22% of the positively aged pieces come from the east (Mississippian and Ordovician) indicating a preference among exotics for materials of potential importance in a trade sys tem such as the one hypothesized above (Figure 4). This small number, however, does not suggest the stockpiling implied in the regional exchange center model. Like the rest of the assemblage, most arti facts made of eastern materials are flakes, totaling 83%. The next most common types of artifacts in this age range are shatter (unmodified non-flake debris) and bladelets, each making up 34% of the non-flake assemblage (Figure 5). Further, 75% of all 276</page><page sequence="9">Daniel C. Pugh The Aker Site (23PL43) Permian 3% Mississippian \ &amp; Ordovician /^ T*^\ "? \. v^*- Pennsylvanian ^ 75% Figure 4. Distribution of positively identified materials. bladelets at the site are of Mississippian and Or dovician materials (Figure 6). Though the total num ber of these artifacts is rather low, it supports Reid's suggestion of item-specific trade for bladelets and prepared cores. Following Morrow's (1987) study, this implies a stylistic, and thus social, bond be tween Hopewell people in the Kansas City area and those who were producing bladelets in central or eastern Missouri. Artifacts made of exotic materials from the west (that is, Permian-age stone) do not present the same trends as those from the east. The sample of Per mian artifacts is very small (n=25) so the statistical significance of these data is problematic. The aver age weight of Permian artifacts, however, is much closer to that of local materials than other exotics (Figure 7). Furthermore, not a single bladelet of Permian-aged material is present in the assemblage.

In McLean's model, the cherts were acquired for use on the hunt ing expedition and curated back to nuclear KCH areas mainly in the form of PPKs or preforms. In deed, the only Permian non-debitage artifacts present are PPKs and modified flakes. While this includes only two PPKs and one modified flake, it is worth noting that at least two of the PPKs of unidentifiable material are a gray color that is com mon to stone of this age and may be an unusual or poor grade Permian chert. A bigger sample of known Permian artifacts in the KCH assemblage is needed before any conclusions about the nature of long distance procurement from the west can be reached. Another key difference between the eastern and western exotic materials appears in the statis tics about heat treatment (Figure 8).

Percent of heat-treated artifacts by material age. thermal alteration in archaeological assemblages. While 58% of Mississippian and Ordovician arti facts had evidence of heat-treatment, only 4% of Permian artifacts have been heated. Local materi als are more frequently heated (14%), but the preferential state of this chert seems to be unheated. Given the small size of the Permian sample, this may be statistical error. Regarding exotic materials from the east, however, the sample is certainly sta tistically valid. Only three non-debitage pieces of eastern exotic material display no thermal alteration (one bladelet, one preform and the only Mississip pian-Ordovician core in the assemblage). This may add a dimension to the procurement and produc tion strategy implied above, because heat treatment is apparently employed at an intermediate to late stage in production, leaving the core unaltered. This suggests that much of the unheated debitage was created in preparing these artifacts for heat treatment at a midpoint in processing. A one-tailed t-test shows no significant difference between the average weight of heated and unheated Mississip pian-Ordovician flakes. This may be expected, though, given that under the system we are sug gesting all primary reduction would be done at or near the material source. Cortex distributions also show predictable trends (Figure 9). Materials positively identified as 100 -. Mississippian H I?| n Pennsylvanian H Permian Unknown 50- - .JMLj.

Once again, the most dramatic change comes in the Mississippian-Ordovician category, 87% of which is non-cortical, and only 2% of which is more than 50% cortical. The Permian assemblage is only slightly less extreme, going from 80% non cortical to 4% over half cortex. Only 54% of the Pennsylvanian assemblage is noncortical, suggest ing significantly less processing of these materials before they reached the site. The cortex distribu tion for the unidentified material category reflects the nature of much of this category. Of the uniden tified materials, 71% are at least partially cortical and 30% are more than half cortical. As noted, it is often the high percent cortex of an object that pre cludes its identification. As in the other material types, flakes and unmodified non-flake debris dominate the Penn sylvanian assemblage (Table 1). Debitage accounts for 87% of all artifacts made from local chert, with flakes alone composing 83%. Of the remain ing artifacts, 27% are cores, further suggesting intensive on-site production of local materials (Fig ure 10). Of shaped artifacts, 26% are PPKs and 14% are preforms, suggesting a focus on mid- to large size bifacial artifacts in the local material industry.

Distribution of non-debitage artifacts of Pennsylva nian materials. the Kansas City group are presumably within a day's walk of the Aker site, but there is a clear preference for two types. Westerville chert accounts for 65% of locally procured materials, with Winterset running a distant second at 19% (Figure 11). All of the types combined into "Local Gray/Local Gray Fossiliferous" add up to only 16% of the local ma terials used. Because no significant difference in knapping quality is known among these cherts, some other factor must account for this discrep ancy. The most likely explanation is that Westerville chert was the easiest to obtain; this area is poten tially rich in this stone as well as Winterset. DISCUSSION The suggestion that the Aker site is a port in Struever's (1968) regional trade center model is not supported by these data. As would be expected at any site, the vast majority of artifacts are made of local material, and artifacts of local material tend to be larger and more cortical and fit a larger array of categories than those of foreign material. The hypothesis, however, is not completely negated. Significant quantities of eastern materials are present, and the consistent influence of eastern Hopewell culture is undeniable based on parallel developments in ceramic and lithic artifact styles. Some level of contact was certainly maintained with groups farther down the Missouri River. Perish able goods not preserved archaeologically may have been of great importance to the trade network. The problem of preservation will always bedevil archae ologists, and it is possible that the Aker site was indeed a trading center focused on perishable goods. However, in light of our analysis and the Winterset Unidentified Local Gray Westerville 65% Figure 11. Distribution of Pennsylvanian chert types. suggestions of Buikstra et al. (1998), we suggest a different function for the site. Given the relatively late dates from Aker, eco nomic activity in the eastern Woodlands would have been relatively low during its occupation, but social cohesiveness would still be important for groups with kinship or ideological ties. This co hesiveness may well have been maintained through periodic aggregations at sites in strategic loca tions along the waterways such as the Aker site. Many types of exchange would be likely under such circumstances, including trade in utilitarian objects, ritualized gift giving, and the transfer of the stylis tic information that kept KCH ceramics similar to those in the broader Hopewell system. Whether or not lithic materials were the pri mary focus of trade for the KCH, the nature of trade in these items is becoming clearer. Appar ently, in eastern and central Missouri, cherts were generally being worked to an intermediate or late stage before being transported. Upon arriving in the Kansas City area, they were finished, with heat treatment applied towards the end of production, perhaps exclusively on site. While these materials were apparently preferred for bladelet production, they were by no means used exclusively for this type of tool. A thin bifacial technology comple mented bladelet technology in Mississippian and Ordovician cherts. The most likely explanation for the predominance of these cherts in bladelet pro duction is a focus on these items as tokens of exchange in social transactions wherein the rela tive quality of the exotic cherts gave them significant value. It is also possible that the fine qualities of these cherts made them desirable in the 279</page><page sequence="12">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 46, No. 177, 2001 production of cutting and penetrating tools such as PPKs. Some materials also found their way into the site from the west. Low numbers of Permian arti facts appear, with relatively high average weights and an apparently different function from other exotics in the Aker assemblage. A procurement strategy embedded within periodic hunting forays may have produced these tools, used predomi nantly for hunting and butchering and infrequently heat-treated. These materials could as easily come in through infrequent encounters with visitors from the west, but it is unlikely that social bonds were as important with western groups given the apparently sporadic nature of contact with them. Some characteristic other than long-distance exchange in lithic materials must have drawn people to the Aker site. Its placement in the lowlands of the Missouri River valley is certainly problem atic, as is pointed out by evidence for occasional flooding during occupation. Among the obvious advantages of such site placement are ready ac cess to the river and floodplain resource zones, access to the Missouri River for transportation purposes, and access to the confluence of the Mis souri and Platte rivers. If the site's role in the KCH settlement system was purely economic, being situated at this intersection of waterways would certainly have been advantageous as it would have allowed the quickest travel to and from sites along these rivers. This advantage would also, however, have made the site a good pick for a village to be visited regularly or periodically by groups for cer emonial or festive purposes. Use of the Aker site as a meeting place may further explain the unusu ally high quantities of hearth debris excavated by Johnson. The embeddedness of pre-market eco nomic systems implies that exchange and periodic aggregation often cannot be separated and that they function in ways beyond the simple transfer of goods. Morrow (1987) has demonstrated the importance of bladelets as tokens of exchange in other areas of the Hopewell world. Bladelets made of exotic materials occur in significant numbers at the Aker site. Given all of these factors, it seems very likely that the Aker site functioned as a peri odic aggregation site for KCH people and their trading partners with whom they maintained cultural, and perhaps kinship, ties in central and eastern Missouri. The drastic overall decline in mean site el evation from settlements in Late Archaic times to villages in Woodland times likely indicates a changing emphasis on resource zones. The estab lished subsistence foci for these periods does indicate a shift from predominantly large game hunting to mixed hunting and gathering with some level of cultivation focused on plants thriving in backwater areas. It is suggested that later Wood land peoples further refined this focus as the bow and arrow deemphasized larger game and horticulture gained importance leading up to Late Prehistoric agricultural settlements. Given the relatively late radiocarbon dates for the Aker site in the KCH sequence, the village may have been partially established as a community focused on tending and harvesting mudflat plants such as lambsquarter. It is doubtful that these resources supplied enough surpluses to create a redistribution economy sending horticultural resources to other villages and smaller commu nities upstream. However, flooding hazards may have been mitigated by abandonment of the vil lage in the spring months when discharge of the rivers was at its peak. If this were the case, the site would have been occupied during the summer when plant resources required tending and through the fall when they were harvested. Additional people may have joined the community in the fall to take part in harvesting; this may have been how aggregations were scheduled. At this time, ex change of materials, information, and social rela tionships would occur. The large quantities of hearth debris would have been produced in ac commodating the outside traders and celebrating the harvest. This seasonal use of the site is con trary to traditional models for KCH settlement, but it is similar to strategies employed by the Western Apache, among others, wherein agricultural camps are occupied during winter and spring months and abandoned in favor of other foraging activities during the summer and fall (Goodwin 1942:155-158; Buskirk 1986:113). Given the paucity of typical Hopewell Interac tion Sphere goods in the KCH assemblage, it is safe to assume that, whatever contact and exchange were occurring, KCH interaction with the broader Hopewell world was limited to groups in the Big 280</page><page sequence="13">Daniel C. Pugh The Aker Site (23PL43) Bend area of central Missouri and perhaps some infrequent contact with eastern Missouri. The single established material in this exchange is the Mississippian and Ordovician lithic material pre ferred for bladelet production. Through whatever contact was maintained, a flow of ideas was per petuated. In his discussion of the GE Mound, Seeman (1995) argues that the Hopewell system itself was a network of communication among groups sharing ideological elements as an adap tive response to subsistence intensification in the Middle Woodland period. Thus, status symbols and other artifact types were ascribed specific mean ings that were shared by all members of the Hopewell universe and these meanings related di rectly to Hopewell social structure. Under this framework, it seems that regular aggregation, as well as material exchange and shifting subsistence strategies, was imperative for the very existence of the Hopewell. Thus loci such as the Aker site played integral roles in trade as well as sociocul tural maintenance.
