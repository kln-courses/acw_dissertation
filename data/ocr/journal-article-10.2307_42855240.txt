It is intriguing, illuminating, lively and stimulating. Above all it is socio- logical. Perhaps too sociological. The book is novel in the animal rights literature in that it is explanatory rather than prescriptive - a historical sociology of the rise of animal rights as a discourse rather than an argument within animal rights philosophy. In sociology it is novel in paying attention to the non-human world, even if it does so by focusing on human discourses about that world and reducing them to their social function. Tester analyses the rise of animal rights from figures like Rousseau, Bentham and Henry Salt in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to Singer, Clark, Regan, Midgeley and the Animal Liberation Front today. He draws attention to the significance of their anthropomorphism - that it is sympto- matic of a concern with the human rather than the animal in animal rights. Tester rejects psychoanalytical, etho- logical and socio-biological explanations for our attachments to animals. The book is influenced, rather,, by analyses of social classification by figures like Foucault, Elias, Lévi-Strauss and Mary Douglas. Its big themes are: (i) the con- ceptualisation through history of the status of animals within the bipolar classification of similitude and difference; (ii) the function of animal rights for humanity rather than animals. Animal rights gives moral rights to animals on the basis that they share a common sentient or organic structure with humans or an equality of value or membership of the same commonwealth (similarity), yet distinguishes humans as moral agents from animals as the objects of moral attention (difference). In this way animal rights, far from being all about animals, helps humans, in a Durkheimian sense, to establish our distance and distinctiveness from them. Tester adds three complexities to this thesis. First he is keen to stress that his theory is not all taxonomy and ideas, as is sometimes the case in Foucault's work. It relates also to real social structures and processes such as urbanisation, the civilising process, class relations and the social background of animal rights advocates. Second, he tries to go against a Durkheimian homogenisation of society by showing how discourses on animals maintain intrasocial relations of class domination. Dominant groups have paradoxically defined their own humanity in terms of their concern for animals as against lower strata who are seen to be 'beastly' and 'inhuman(e)' because of their cruelty to animals. This has been used as a mode of social exclusion and a justification for the imposition of bourgeois discipline and social order on subordinate classes. Third, Tester distances himself from the ahistorical approach of figures like Lévi-Strauss and Douglas and draws on the historical work of Keith Thomas and Elias on urbanisation and the civilising process. His book is a theoretical and empirical historical sociology of the discontinuity of classifications of animals in relation to humans and much of it is devoted to detailing historical changes in these classifications. However Tester stretches social con- structionism too far and in doing so, first, reduces animal rights to human self-concern and, second, morally relativises it. On the first he argues that the protagonists of animal rights are concerned more with selfhood and human perfectionism than animals. Their theories are more about some of us defining ourselves as different and distinct as moral agents from non-moral humans and the objects of our moral attention, animals. Yet in his determination to lay out the functions of animal rights for humans Tester sociologises away the concern for aiiimals in its content. On the second point Tester argues that modern animal rights discourses involve merely a different rather than a better set of classifications of animals to those</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 539 previously existing. But the jump from historical relativity to epistemological and ethical relativism is too big. Modern classifications of animals can be a historical and social product but still be more sensitive to the objective, sentient experiences of animals and so amenable to the superior ethical attitude to them. Sociology has the chance in its encounters with the non-human world to be more naturalistic and objectivist and less socially reductionist. Tester misses this chance but his book is still fascinating and enjoyable and to be recommended to all with an interest in this area or the approach he adopts.
