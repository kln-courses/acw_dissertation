<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CASTILIAN TRADITION OF BIBLE ILLUSTRATION THE ROMANESQUE BIBLE FROM SAN MILLAN By John W. Williams With the exception of the Carolingian Bible of San Paolo fuori le mura, all surviving examples of densely illustrated early medieval Biblical manuscripts have a Spanish origin. Even if one excludes the problematical Ashburnham Pentateuch, there remain the two profusely illustrated Catalan Bibles of the early eleventh century and the Bible of 960 in Le6n. It is the purpose of these pages to introduce still another Bible whose numerous minia- tures substantially increase our knowledge of a Spanish tradition of Bible illustration. This is the two-volume Bible from San Millan de la Cogolla now in the library of the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid.1 Volume i contains one hundred and twenty-eight miniatures representing events from the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Kings and Job.2 Genesis and Exodus have ten and twenty-three representations respec- tively, but the books of Kings are decorated with a major pictorial cycle of fifty-one illustrations. Most of the Old Testament miniatures are placed within the columns of text near the passages which they illustrate. With the exception of the figures within initials at the beginning of Judith and Macca- bees, the miniatures of the second volume belong to the New Testament. These do not illustrate the narrative, but serve as prefatory illustrations for the Gospels. Their style indicates that the San Millin Bible was written in the early thirteenth century, between 12oo00 and 122o.3 However, the para- graphs below suggest the manuscript has a significance for the history of book illumination of a much earlier period. The most obvious archaic feature of the San Millin Bible is the relation- ship of text and picture in the illustrated books of the Old Testament (Pls. 8a and 8c, d). Apparently this type of format, with the miniature inserted in the text immediately after the passage it illustrates, was standard in the earliest history of book illustration.4 It is a system encountered also in the Bible of 1 Crist6bal P6rez Pastor, 'Indice por titulos de los c6dices precedentes de los monasterios de San Milln de la Cogolla y San Pedro de Cardefia existentes en la biblioteca de la Real Academia de la Historia,' Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia, liii, 1908, pp. 470-72. 2 See the Appendix for a subject catalogue of the miniatures. 3 The style of the miniatures, freed from the emphatic patternization of drapery common in the previous century, is more patently of a thirteenth-century date than is the palaeo- graphy. P6rez Pastor, loc. cit., assigned it to the thirteenth century, as did J. Dominguez Bordona, Cddices miniados espaioles, Madrid, 1929, p. 189, no. xlviii. Claudio Boutelou y Soldevilla, 'Estudio de la miniatura espafiola desde el siglo X al XIX', Boletin de la Sociedad Espanola de Excursiones, xiv, 1906, p. 5, called the manuscript the 'Biblia de 1240', but with- out disclosing the basis for that precise date. The last column of text, which may have con- tained a colophon, had already been removed from the manuscript by the time of P6rez Pastor's description. The appearance of the miniatures and initials suggests a date close to that of the Beatus Commentary of 1220 from Las Huelgas in the Morgan Library. See W. Neuss, Die Apokalypse des H.

Peter and Paul at Valeranica, near Burgos.5 The similarity of this Bible to our thirteenth-century one goes, however, beyond this coinci- dence, for comparison reveals a general duplication of subjects chosen for illustration and their composition as well. This may be seen, for example, by comparing fol. 36r of the Bible in Le6n (P1. 8b) with fol. 40v of volume i of the Bible in Madrid (P1. 8a). A miniature is inserted immediately after Exodus vii, I o: 'And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did as the Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.' In both manuscripts Moses and Aaron stand before the enthroned ruler, who holds a sword and is accompanied by attendants. The leading figure, identified by a legend in the Le6n Bible as Moses, holds the metamorphosed rod instead of casting it at the feet of Pharaoh as the Biblical passage states. In the space between the columns of text the tenth-century Bible includes the serpent devouring the rods of the Egyptian magicians, an event described in verse I2, but otherwise the two coincide in essential respects. The second picture on the page is also inserted immediately after the text it illustrates, in the earlier Bible after verse 2 I, in the San Millkin Bible after verse 20. The subject is 'Aaron Converting Water into Blood', and the composition of the two is the same except for the positions of the servants. The illustrations of 'David Instructing His Troops' and the 'Death of Absalom' (2 Kings xviii, 4-14) are identically placed in relation to the text in both manuscripts (Pls. 8c, 8d). In the first miniature David stands at the gate of the walled city gesturing towards his warriors. Some of these are mounted and clothed in chain-mail in the Romanesque Bible in this miniature and in the 'Death of Absalom'. The interpretation of the latter coincides closely in the two Bibles. Absalom, hanging from the limb of a tree, has been struck by two spears as his riderless horse bounds away.6 The frontispieces for the book of Leviticus may serve as a final demonstration that the two Bibles are related (cf. Pls. 9a, 9b). These are the only full-page illustrations in the Old Testament cycles of either manuscript. An interior view of the Wilderness Tabernacle is enframed by masonry walls and two columns supporting an arch. Curtains are pulled aside to reveal the ark and a tabular central altar. The similarity of these frontispieces and the miniatures we have discussed cannot be the result of mere coincidence. Some kind of connection between the two Bibles is indicated. It is unlikely that the younger manuscript is directly based upon the older, for the former contains thirty-five miniatures absent from the Bible in Le6n, seven of them in Genesis, two in Exodus and the great majority, twenty-six, in Kings. On the other hand, the tenth-century Bible includes twenty-two 5 Cod. 2.

The 'Death of Absalom', however, does have parallels. See, e.g., Vat. gr. 333, fol. 6or.</page><page sequence="8">68 JOHN W. WILLIAMS illustrations in seven different books, which are not encountered in the Bible from San Millan. The independence of the two is confirmed by the Old Latin glosses in the margins of both Bibles. In the manuscript from San Millian they are more numerous, appearing in six books for which there are no glosses in the Bible of 960.7 The two Bibles are indirectly related, and in order to assess their relationship the whole distinctive family of Spanish Bibles, all members of which belong or belonged to monasteries in Old Castile, has to be con- sidered. In the seventeenth century the Benedictine historian Gregorio de Argaiz saw a large illustrated Bible in the Castilian monastery of Ofia.8 According to the colophon transcribed by Argaiz it was written in the year 9539 by Florentius, who was Castile's leading scribe and the mentor of Sanctius, the scribe of the Bible of 960 in Le6n. Unfortunately only twelve New Testament leaves of this codex survive,10 but Argaiz speaks of Florentius 'imaginando las principales Historias del Testamento viejo'. Although the script of the Bible in San Isidoro appears somewhat inferior to that of the Ofia folios, its initials, in the two instances which offer comparisons, are almost replicas of those of the earlier Bible. It seems probable that the Bible of 960 was written by Sanctius, since his name appears in the colophon, but that the illuminations were the responsibility of Florentius. Both of their portraits appear on the Omega page at its conclusion.11 At any rate the Bible of 960 seems to have been the twin of the Bible of Ofia. The library of San Isidoro has another large illustrated Bible in three volumes written in i162.12 Its cycles of Old Testament miniatures correspond to those of the Bible of 960 and seem to have been based upon them (cf. Pls. 9b, ioa).13 Yet there are reasons to think that perhaps an unknown common model stands behind both of the Bibles of San Isidoro. While the illustration of the meeting of David and Goliath in the Bible of 1162 includes the figure of David with a sling,14 the version in the Bible of 96o does not. The addition of this figure may be attributed to the initiative of the illuminator of 7 T.

See Constancio Gutierrez, 'Cuindo se escribi6 la llamada "Biblia de Ofia"?', Archi- vos leoneses, xv, 1961, pp. 87-1oo. The same information is given by Gutierrez in Estudios eclesidsticos, xxxiv, 1960, pp. 403-11 . 10 Eleven of the folios are in the possession of La Hermandad de Sacerdotes Operarios Diocesanos. They are at the Casa Central of the Hermandad in Madrid, not in Salamanca. Photographs of these leaves are reproduced in T. Ayuso Marazuela, La biblia de OQa, Zaragoza, 1945. The twelfth is in the library of the monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos. See A.

For Genesis the Bible of i 162 contains an illustration of 'Joseph before Pharaoh' (i, fol. 26v). Although the Bible from San Millan includes a representation of 'Jacob Recognizing Joseph's Coat', no Joseph scene appears in the Bible of 960.15 It is possible that a lost manuscript served as the model for both of the Le6n Bibles and the Bible of Ofia written by Florentius in 943. Differences in the Old Latin glosses in the Bibles of 960 and 1162 support this hypothesis.16 A lost Bible formerly at San Isidoro was seen by visitors to the library in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. After describing the Bible of 960 Manuel Risco referred to another manuscript: 'Biblia. Es otro c6dice G6tico, y aunque no se lee in 61 alguna nota del tiempo en que se escribid, parece por la forma de letra ser de igual antigfiedad al antecedente.'17 Eguren's account is the more complete: 'Contiene este c6dice, como el anterior [Bible of 960], la genealogia de Jesucristo desde Adam, y en dos espacios circulares de noticia de la 6poca en que empezaron a profetizar los profetas mayores y menores; concluye la genealogia de Jesucristo, y al fin de la misma hay una miniatura que representa la Anunciacidn, y dentro de un circulo se lee: colligitur omne tempus ab Adam usque ad Christum VCXCVIIII (5199). En la misma miniatura se ve el catilogo de los reyes de Roma. . .. Es completo y bien escrito de letra del siglo IX. No consta el afio en que se hizo, ni el nombre del transcriptor.'18 The similarity of this manuscript to the Bibles of 96o and i162 is confirmed by the presence of the Genealogical Tables, which, in the Bible of 96o, also conclude with an 'Annunciation' and a list of the Kings of Rome.19 15 The fact that this is the only addition to the Old Testament cycles in the copy of I162 seems to be an argument for rather than against the existence of a lost common model. It is easier to imagine that the illustrator of the Bible of 960 omitted the scene of Joseph before Pharaoh than that the illuminator of the Bible of i i162 was inspired to invent an illustration for this episode and no other. Another miniature the Romanesque Bible does not share with the Bible of 960 is the 'Combat of the Bird and Serpent'. Galindo, loc. cit., p. 52, believes the disrupted first gathering of the Bible of 960 originally in- cluded this picture. It is also found in the San Millin Bible (I fols. 6v-7r). For the history of this image see R. Wittkower, this Journal, I, 1937/38, pp. 253-57; ibid., II, 1938/39, pp. 293-325. 16 T.

This is Ayuso's 'Legionense supuesto' (Vetus Latina Hispana, no. 23, pp. 355-56). 18 Jos' Maria Eguren, Memoria descriptiva de los cddices notables conservados en los archivos eclesidsticos de Espana, Madrid, 1859, p. 47. Eguren must have compiled his notes on the library at San Isidoro several years prior to the publication of the Memoria, for Jos6 M. Quadrado, in 1855, stated that a Bible con- temporary with the one of 960 was lost (Recuerdos y bellezas de Espana : Ledn y Asturias, Madrid, 1855, p. 352, n. i). Jules Tailhan's reference to a second Bible at San Isidoro of the same format as the Bible of 960 may be based on Eguren's description ('Appendice sur les bibliotheques espagnoles du haut moyen age', Nouveaux melanges d'archiologie, d'histoire et de litterature sur le moyen dge, ed. Charles Cahier, Paris, 1874-77, iv, p. 307). 19 Fols. 5v-ior. It is not in the copy of 1162. Actually, the image cannot be an 'Annunciation'. Gabriel stands before the Virgin, but the Christ Child is already present on her lap. The miniature is probably a deficient version of the type of Adoration of the Magi in which an angel introduces the Kings. For this type see G. A. Wellen, Theo- tokos: eine ikonographische Abhandlung fiber das Gottesmutterbild in friihchristlicher Zeit, Utrecht- Antwerp, 1961, p. 57. The Genealogical</page><page sequence="10">70 JOHN W. WILLIAMS Eguren's failure to mention other miniatures does not prove there were none, since his description of the Old Testament of the Bible of 960 merely states that it 'contiene todos los libros del Antiguo Testamento, con- cluyendo con los dos de Macabeos'.20 To Risco this Bible appeared to be of the same age as the Bible of 960, whereas to Eguren it seemed somewhat older. Since it is only in our own day that Visigothic palaeography is known suffi- ciently well to allow dating, their assessments can be accepted in a general sense only, but it is reasonable to conclude that the Bible was written no more recently than the tenth century. It seems to have been illustrated, and it may have been the model for the copies of 943, 960 and I i162. It is improbable that the Bible from San Millin depended upon this lost manuscript, or some intermediary copy, because of the differences between the Romanesque Bible and the Le6n family of codices. Rather, it appears to belong to a distinct branch of the family of the pictorial archetype. This is especially evident in a comparison of the frontispieces for Leviticus in the Bible of 960 (P1. 9b) and the Bible from San Millin (P1. 9a). A detailed description of the sanctuary raised by the Israelites after the mandate given Moses on Mount Sinai is found in the final chapters of Genesis, and Leviticus, the book for which our illustrations serve as frontispieces. As described it is an impermanent structure, a tent, but in the miniatures it is con- verted into a substantial masonry building. In the tenth-century version (P1. 9b) the large figure to the left of the central altar is identified by a legend as Aaron. He reaches forward to touch the curious pronged object standing upon the altar, carrying out the anointment described in Leviticus xix, 9: 'And the sons of Aaron brought the blood of the sin offering unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar. .. His exceptionally voluminous drapery seems an acknowledgement of the priestly vestment described in Exodus xxxix, with the gilt circular form behind his head a depiction of the gold plate put upon Aaron's mitre before the ceremony of consecration (Leviticus viii, 9), rather than a nimbus. A precise moment is less easily identified in the thirteenth-century version from San Millkn. A figure with raised arms stands to the left of the central altar, but there is another important figure standing at the right beside a second altar which holds a dish with two sacrificed rams. This is probably the Altar of Holocausts of Exodus xxxviii, 1-7. Aaron and his sons would be the partici- pants at the left, while the figure with a staff who seems to be holding the large laver above the altar of holocausts would be Moses. If this interpretation is correct, the miniature would refer to another chapter of Leviticus, the eighth, where Moses consecrates Aaron and the Levites, makes burnt offerings, and anoints the altar. This is an independent witness to the archetype behind the Spanish frontispieces, and its greater complexity suggests that in some respects it is a better witness. This is clearly the case with regard to the treatment of the wall of the courtyard. In the Bible of 960 the wall itself has Tables of the San Sever Beatus conclude with an Adoration, without, however, the figure of Gabriel (Neuss, Apokalypse, fig. 29), as do those of the twelfth-century Bible in the Biblioteca Pfiblica Provincial de Burgos (fol. 8v). An Adoration is appropriate at this point, for adjacent is a list of the early rulers of Rome. 20 Eguren, op. cit., p. 47.</page><page sequence="11">BIBLE FROM SAN MILLAN 71 disappeared, leaving what appears to be a draped altar in the foreground. This motif is converted in the Bible of i162 into a footstool beneath the feet of Aaron. Only in the Bible from San Millan is the temenos wall itself included and the central object unambiguously revealed as the curtained gateway men- tioned in Exodus xxvii, 16. A consistent use of the column-picture system of illustration as it is seen in the Castilian Bibles is unique among surviving medieval Biblical codices and is an indication of their conservatism. This system is usually encountered in secular manuscripts obviously dependent upon late antique prototypes such as the illustrated Physiologus and works of Terence, and it has been attributed to the earliest period in the development of the illustrated codex.21 During the course of the Middle Ages artists frequently used a different scheme, grouping several illustrations on a full page as in the Bible of San Paolo f. 1. m. or the Catalan Bibles. The separation of the illustration from its supporting text was encouraged by practical considerations. When independent sources for the illustrations and for the text were utilized it eliminated the need to ascertain the relevant textual location for the individual pictorial units in order to integrate them with the narrative. Writing and decoration could proceed independently. Therefore, when we find the retention of the column- picture system in the Spanish Bibles it is unreasonable to assume that it is the result of a reintegration of text and miniatures derived from diverse sources. It is more likely that the text and pictures came from the same sources, that Biblical manuscripts with miniatures incorporated into their texts were copied. For this reason the history of the textual tradition of the Castilian Bibles is relevant to speculations about the origins of their illustrations. The Bible from San Millhin and those in Le6n belong to a distinctive Spanish group.22 Its members are especially noteworthy because of extensive marginal glosses giving Old Latin versions of Vulgate passages in the Old and New Testaments. These are found in twenty-seven books of the Bible from San Millin.23 Since even the most critical opinion recognizes that they go back to a Spanish archetype of the sixth or seventh century,24 the glosses show that the Bible from San Millan perpetuated an ancient Vulgate tradition.25 The Spanish 21 Weitzmann, Roll and Codex, pp. 69ff. Weitzmann uses the Bible of 960 to document his conclusion with regard to Biblical texts: 'Finally the same system [that of the column picture] is also applied in Christian texts such as the Spanish Bible in St. Isidoro in Le6n from the year 960. This clearly points to the fact that Bible illustration likewise had started out with frameless column pictures' (p. 76). 22 Samuel Berger, Histoire de la Vulgate pen- dant les premiers siecles du moyen dge, Paris, 1893, pp. 2I1ff.; Henri Quentin, Mimoire sur l'Ntab- lissement du texte de la Vulgate, Paris, 1922, pp. 298ff. For other Bibles related to the recension of the Le6n and San Millkn Bibles see items 93 and 95 of Ayuso's catalogue of codices in Vetus Latina Hispana, pp. 369, 370. These Bibles do not contain illustrations. We know nothing of the decoration of a lost tenth- century Bible of this recension which was once in Valvanera (ibid., no. 26, p. 367). 23 Ayuso, Vetus Latina Hispana, pp. 409ff. 24 B.

WILLIAMS manuscripts which transmitted the Old Latin notes could as well have trans- mitted the illustrations which are united to the text. The Old Testament miniatures of the Castilian Bibles would seem to descend from an illustrated Bible of the Visigothic period. Not being a column picture, the Tabernacle frontispiece would not be included in the preceding speculations about the age of the Old Testament cycles.26 Nevertheless, it too seems to go back to a prototype older than the tenth century. The earliest known representation of the Wilderness Taber- nacle in manuscript illumination is spread across fols. 2v-3r in the Codex Amiatinus.27 This plan of the court and sanctuary is unrelated to the scene which we have discussed, since it is a schematic representation and not an illustration of a specific Biblical event. Only the names of Moses and Aaron are written in the courtyard. Its independence from other versions is under- standable. We know that it derives from a representation in the Codex Grandior which Cassiodorus had executed after a (presumably) verbal descrip- tion given by a learned but blind traveller from the East.28 Two other repre- sentations occur in a manuscript approximately contemporary with the Codex Amiatinus, the Ashburnham Pentateuch.29 In the first of them (P1. iob) the Tabernacle is closer to the Biblical description than are the Spanish versions in being constructed of curtains supported by a wooden framework. However, nothing is done specifically to identify the structure as a Jewish sanctuary. An altar of the type provided for Abel and Melchisedec in the mosaic at San Vitale (Revue binidictine, xxxi, 1914-19, pp. 373-401), attributed the recension to which the San Millkn and Le6n Bibles belong to the editor- ship of a fifth-century Spanish Bishop, Pere- grinus, whose name appears in the prefaces attached to Jerome's prologue to the books of Solomon and to the Pauline Epistles. The idea that this edition descended virtually in- tact and free from the influences of other Vulgate traditions in the Castilian Bibles was a central theme in Ayuso's studies, appearing first in Estudios biblicos (ii, I943ff.) and then in La biblia de OQa, La Vetus Latina Hispana, and Biblia polyglotta matritensia, Ser. viii, vol. 21, Madrid, 1960, pp. 29-30. He believed the Bible of 960 was the purest representative of this Vulgate edition, in fact, a direct copy of the fifth-century archetype (Vetus Latina His- pana, p. 434), which would have been illus- trated (Estudios biblicos, xix, 1960, p. 175). In Ayuso's opinion ( Vetus Latina Hispana, p. 432) the Bible from San Millan was descended from an intermediary archetype of the year 652. This date is found at the end of a chronicle of world history on fols. 4v-6r of that manuscript: colligitur omne tempus ab exordio mundi usque in presentem gloriosi Recevendi principis annum qui est era DCLXXXX anni quin- que milia DCCCLXII. finit. Although Ayuso himself (Estudios biblicos, xix, 1960, p. 199) recognized that this chronicle was the one in Book v of Isidore's Etymologiae, he apparently did not realize that the colophon of 652 is attached to the chronicle and frequently appears with it in whatever manuscript one is dealing with. See T. Mommsen, ed., Monu- menta Germaniae Historica: Auctores Antiquissimi, xi, I, Berlin, 1893, pp. 425-80, 5o6. 26 The argument from format would also be irrelevant to the miniature of the 'Creation, Fall and Punishment of Adam and Eve' on fol. I2V. There exists no corresponding set of miniatures in the Bible of 96o, and the composition seems inspired by contemporary decorative traditions outside Spain.

The tent they stand within is apparently the earlier Tabernacle of the Congrega- tion mentioned in Exodus xxxiii, 7- 11. At the time Joshua joined Moses there the larger Tabernacle had not been built, and Joshua is not Moses' companion in the subsequent events connected with the larger sanctuary. Aaron, who stands with his sons Nadab and Abihu in a tent on the opposite side of the Tabernacle, balances the figure of Moses, performing the same action of drawing aside a curtain. Their attitudes are not explained by any specific passage in Exodus or Leviticus. The Tabernacle appears again in the Ash- burnham Pentateuch in a miniature in the book of Numbers (P1. Ioc). Here a specific passage is referred to in which God speaks to Moses and seventy elders of Israel assembled in the Tabernacle (Num. xi, 16ff.). Despite the replacement of the hangings of the first representation by a more permanent architecture, the sanctuary has more points of contact with the description in Genesis. The major part of the precinct is a courtyard. A gateway with a hanging prominently displayed in its second storey offers entry to the court- yard from the lower left corner. The pedimented Tabernacle standing within contains two altars. One is of stone and suitable for immolated offerings. The other is a table beside which are two angels with outspread wings, apparently a reference to the cherubim above the Mercy seat which is placed upon the ark (Gen. xxv, 20-2 i). The ark itself is not present, however, either in its cus- tomary medieval form of a chest with poles, or in its Jewish guise as a cabinet. The whole complex, seen from a sort of bird's-eye view, differs basically from the Tabernacle of the Bible from San Millan, which is seen in section. Despite the frequent assignment of the Ashburnham Pentateuch to a Spanish scrip- torium or one in close contact with the Peninsula, its representations of the Wilderness Tabernacle have no connection with the pictorial tradition of the medieval Spanish Bibles. The final surviving early medieval representation of the Tabernacle, that of the Bible of the monastery of San Paolo f. 1. m. (P1. iod),31 serves, like those of the Spanish Bibles, as a frontispiece for Leviticus. The episodes illustrated correspond most closely with those in the Bible from San Millan. They are so composed as to form four registers. In the uppermost figures fasten the hangings which enclose the Tabernacle. Just below them is the sanctuary proper where the ark, flanked by cherubim, rests upon an altar. A white- bearded figure reaches up to touch a corner of the altar, while at the left a figure of identical appearance holds a horn of anointment above the head of the first of a file of figures. Standing in the centre of this register, before the altar which supports the ark, is a seven-branched candelabrum. The axis of 30 Despite evidence connecting the manu- script with Jewish traditions.

WILLIAMS the lowest register is a post which marks the parting of two curtains. Before this entrance to the sacred precinct a sacrifice is taking place and a white- bearded figure stoops to receive the blood of the immolated bullock. Most of the events on this page refer to Leviticus viii, 1 O-I 5. Moses, the bearded figure represented three times, is shown consecrating Aaron and his sons for the priesthood and placing the oil or blood of consecration upon the altar of the Tabernacle. As in the Spanish Bibles this frontispiece is based upon specific events narrated in Leviticus. Yet it does not appear to be related to them through any common archetype. However, the Spanish version, especially as it appears in the Le6n Bibles, does have parallels with the earliest known representation of the Wilderness Tabernacle, the fresco in the synagogue at Dura-Europos (P1. I oe).2 The subject, the consecration of the Tabernacle, is identical. Aaron dominates the scene through his size and the elaborateness of his vestments. The masonry wall of the courtyard in the foreground is pierced by three doorways, the central one of which is veiled. The Tabernacle itself is a pedimented antique temple whose form has as little correspondence with the Biblical description of a tent sanctuary as the architectural framework of the Spanish miniatures. In the centre of its veiled entrance rests the Ark of the Covenant. The menorah so prominently displayed in the fresco seems to have no counterpart in the Spanish frontispieces,33 but the San Millkn Bible has the sacrificial altar which stands beside Aaron in the wall painting. The representation in the synagogue at Dura and those of the Spanish Bibles are thus linked by the similarity of subject: Aaron officiating at the consecra- tion of the Tabernacle. It is a scene directly based upon the Biblical narra- tive,34 and has nothing to do with the more general emblematic representa- tions of the Jewish sanctuary such as are found in the mosaic at Beth Alpha and in various later manuscripts.35 As for the composition, most of the dif- ferences result from the retention of spatial devices in the fresco version. The precinct wall is clearly meant to appear in the foreground, while the Taber- nacle itself, reduced in size, occupies a more distant background plane. The connection, in which the differences are less striking than the similarities, suggests that the Leviticus frontispieces of the Castilian Bibles reflect traditions 32 Carl H. Kraeling, The Synagogue; The Excavations at Dura-Europos Conducted by Yale University and the French Academy of Inscriptions and Letters (Final Report viii, pt. i), New Haven, 1956, pp. 125-31, P1. lx. 33 See note 38. 34 Kraeling (op. cit.) is undoubtedly right in thus interpreting the Dura scene despite the artist's failure to 'emancipate himself from his architectural clich6s sufficiently to do jus- tice to the portable character of the Wilder- ness Tabernacle'. However, I question the restriction of the subject to Exodus xl and Numbers vii (pp. 130-31). His basis for the connection with Numbers is the red colour of the bullock about to be slaughtered on the left. But in Kraeling's colour plate this animal appears to be the same hue as the 'dark brown' goats' hair walls of the Tabernacle. Kraeling's designation of the subject has been rejected recently by E. R. Goodenough (Jewish Symbols of the Greco-Roman Period, x, New York, 1964, pp. 3, 19f.) on the grounds that the structure represented is too substan- tial to be the Wilderness Tabernacle. In his view the scene represents 'an idealized generalization of the priesthood of Aaron, the "temple cultus as such" ' (p. 2o). 35 This tradition is surveyed and illustrated by Cecil Roth, loc. cit. (n. 27).

It is possible that the ultimate source for the Spanish miniatures of the Tabernacle was a frontispiece developed in a Jewish ambient, a version of which was incorporated into Spanish Bible illustration. By the tenth century this prototype seems to be misrepresented in the Bibles in Le6n, for there is at least one confusion of a legend and its referent in the Bible of 960. The velum, candelabrum, archa and altare can be associated with appro- priate items of cult furniture, but it is impossible to reconcile the quadrated rectangular object to the left of the ark with the label labrum appearing just above it. The brazen laver referred to in Exodus36 is conspicuous in representa- tions of the Tabernacle, and figures prominently in the Codex Amiatinus.37 It appears in the Bible from San Millan above the altar of sacrifice, but the tenth-century illuminator attached its name to an object having no resem- blance to a basin. Rather, the gilt subdivided rectangle of the Le6n Bible is closer in form to the altar grill represented in the Smyrna Octateuch.38 The misunderstanding exhibited by the tenth-century picture probably results from the use of a prototype inherited from an earlier period. It is probable that the miniature of the Tabernacle was in the archetypal Bible containing the cycles of other Old Testament illustrations. New Testament The Castilian Bibles do not include illustrations of the Gospel narratives within the columns of the text. Consequently the history of the text is less relevant to the history of the New Testament miniatures. The enthroned Christ with the symbols of the Evangelists (ii, fol. 19iv) and the Canon Tables with the beast symbols (ii, fols. I92r-194v) are types one accepts as conven- tional in a Bible of the thirteenth century. Even the therianthropic Evangelist symbols at the head of the Gospel prefaces were common in Spanish art in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The frontispieces for the Gospels, however, employ an iconography for which there are Spanish precedents surviving from the tenth century.39 For the first three Gospels these consist of representations of the Evangelists as authors (Pls. i i a and b), while the fourth shows two 36 Exodus xxx, I7-2I; xxxviii, 8; xl, 7. 37 Roth, loc. cit., P1. Ioa. 38 Fol. I Ir, D. C. Hesseling, Miniatures de l'octateuque grec de Smyrne (Codices Graeci et Latini photographice depicti, suppl. vi), Leyden, 1909, fig. 195. The curved objects above the 'labrum' are also difficult to decipher. The most plausible explanation is that they constitute a very poorly understood menorah. In other miniatures of the tenth century cups or bowls are represented by such a form (Neuss, Apokalypse, fig. 203), as if they were seen in section, and in the Vulgate de- scription the seven-branched lamp is said to consist of a combination of scyphi (Exodus xxv, 33; xxxvii, 20). In the Bible from San Millain they have been moved to the right side of the miniature and seem more patently to be bowls. A more conventional menorah is represented on fol. I93v of the first volume of this Bible, however (P1. I2e). The absence of the menorah from these representations would be surprising, and the legend candela- brum now attached to the hanging lamp in the Bible of 960 may have become disasso- ciated from its original referent, a menorah. 39 This may be true also of the miniature of the Apostles on fol. i83r of Vol. ii of the Bible from San Millan, which is the first miniature of the New Testament. It may be related to the pictures of the twelve Apostles in the Beatus Commentaries. For these see Neuss, Apokalypse, pp. 140-41. The composi- tion, with its peaked frame, is also remindful of the frontispiece of the Apostle's choosing a twelfth witness in the Rabbula Gospels (Carlo Cecchelli, et al., The Rabbula Gospels, Oltun and Lausanne, I959).</page><page sequence="16">76 JOHN W. WILLIAMS angels holding books (P1. I Ic). The composition of the first and last resemble similar miniatures in the illustrated Beatus Commentaries to such a marked degree that we are justified in treating them in connection with the Beatus series.40 In the frontispiece for Matthew (P1. I I a) a figure seated at the left turns to another approaching from the right with a book. Behind each of the figures is an area of blue reserved within the background field of red so as to suggest an arcade. A decorative band separates these figures from a bust-length symbol of Matthew above. A multi-lobed arch encloses all the figures and is in turn enframed by a rectangular border. By analogy with the miniatures preceding the Gospel of Mark (P1. I I b) and the Gospel of Luke this manner of framing, like that of the miniature of the angels (P1. I Ic), may be interpreted as a Romanesque transformation of a more traditional column and arch frame. The two figures and the symbol have gilt nimbi. In the Beatus versions also we encounter a seated figure at the left in communication with a standing figure at the right, with a symbol of Matthew in the tympanum (P1. I I d). Neuss described the subject of these frontispieces as Christ (the seated figure) receiving the Gospels from the Evangelists.41 Nevertheless, the composition is one we should expect to find dedicated to the Evangelist as the principal figure. Some of the Beatus miniatures have an inscription taken from the Carmen Paschale of Sedulius which refers solely to the individual Evangelist,42 and in general the frontispieces recall the Carolingian portraits of the solitary Evangelists in the manuscripts of the Palace School. Neuss's identification of the seated figure as Christ apparently is based upon the cruciform nimbus which they have in the earlier Beatus manuscript in the Morgan Library, but the value of this detail is questionable.43 Even the angels of the complemen- tary frontispieces on fols. 3r and 4r have cruciform nimbi. Furthermore, the crossed nimbus is only rarely encountered in the Evangelist portraits of the remaining Beatus Commentaries.44 We have no clear evidence that the illuminator of any of the Spanish versions worked under the impression that the scenes represented Christ in the company of the Evangelists. The frontispieces for Matthew and John in the Carolingian Gospels of St. Livinus in Ghent are related iconographically to the Spanish examples. Koehler described them as the Evangelists standing before Christ and receiving 40 For the Beatus versions see Neuss, Apoka- lypse, pp. I I16-19, figs. 6-I3. Another example consisting of a single page with angels holding the Gospel of John has now been added to Neuss's list. It dates from the twelfth century and is in the Museo Diocesano in Gerona.

But on fol. 2v (Luke) two arms of a cross of pink and blue lines and the beginning of a third arm are visible on the nimbus of the seated figure. 44 Not even the San Sever Beatus, which Neuss chose to regard as the best record of the illustrated archetype behind all of the Beatus miniatures, gives a cross to the nimbus of the seated figures or any nimbus to the standing</page><page sequence="17">BIBLE FROM SAN MILLAN 77 their Gospels from him.45 This is a subject presented in an unambiguous form in the contemporary Gospels in Perugia,46 where the figures are identi- fied by legends, but this clarity does not characterize the Ghent miniatures. Here the nimbi of the seated figures lack the distinguishing cross, and the standing figures have no nimbus at all. Moreover, in the frontispiece for Matthew the seated figure is bearded, in that for John he is not. As with the Spanish examples, the identification of the subject of the Ghent frontispieces as the Evangelists in the presence of Christ is questionable.47 In the San Millkn Bible the miniature for Mark (P1. I I b) and that for Luke differ from the one for Matthew in that both figures stand. They have gilt nimbi and carry books, and aside from the beard worn by a member of each pair, they are not distinguished. One can say no more than that one of the figures is an Evangelist in the company of another sanctified figure. Frontispieces with an iconography of accompanied Evangelists are found in Byzantine manuscripts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.48 In Lawra MS. 7, for example, Matthew is represented seated before a standing scribe,49 while in the frontispiece for Luke the Evangelist is standing beside St. Paul.50 The latter pair is also found in Lawra MS. 104.51 That this iconographic tradition is involved in the Spanish frontispieces is confirmed by one of the Beatus miniatures. In the thirteenth-century copy from Las Huelgas in the Morgan Library52 the frontispiece for John has two standing figures instead figures. Although Neuss stated (Apokalypse, p. 118) that the cruciform nimbus is present in the Rylands Library Commentary, M. R. James (A Descriptive Catalogue of the Latin Manuscripts in The John Rylands Library at Manchester, Manchester-London, 192 1, p. 18) does not mention them and identifies the sub- ject of the frontispieces as seated Evangelists. To my knowledge, outside of the earlier Morgan Beatus the only examples of the cruciform nimbus in the Commentary minia- tures are those of fol. 5v in the Gerona and Turin manuscripts. 45 Wilhelm Koehler, 'Die Denkmiler der karolingischen Kunst in Belgien', Belgische Kunstdenkmdler, ed.

WILLIAMS of the usual combination of a seated with a standing figure, and the one to the right is unequivocally identified as St. Peter by the large key held in his right hand (P1. I2a). The frontispiece for John in Lawra MS. 104 (P1. I2b) shows its author standing with the same Saint.53 This detail confirms the origin of the double portraits in the iconographic tradition of the Evangelists with Witnesses rather than that of the Evangelists receiving their Gospels from Christ. Buchthal has recently demonstrated54 the adaptation in the West at an early date of a pre-Iconoclastic Evangelist portrait. The Spanish series and the Ghent miniatures would point to a similar adaptation.55 Although the Bible from San Millkn does not contain a complete set of Gospel frontispieces, a page devoted to each Evangelist paired with a page of angels holding books, it is significant that both types are included. In all likeli- hood the frontispieces originated in Bible illustration and moved from there to the Beatus Commentary.56 Their location before the individual Gospels in the San Millhin Bible is a logical one, whereas there is no specific passage in the Commentary to explain their presence in the Beatus manuscripts. The Beatus miniatures do testify, however, to the occurrence of this iconography in Spain at least by the tenth century, and at the same time as representatives of the prototype they are purer than the simplified versions in the Bible from San Millhin. Formally they belong to the Western tradition for representing the authors of the Gospels. Pictures of the Evangelists seated below their symbols beneath an arcade are known first of all from the Augustine Gospels in Cambridge, dating from c. 600,57 and later on from the examples in the Codex Aureus in Stockholm from the middle of the eighth century.58 The Gudohinus Gospels of the eighth century show the arcade formula was also 68 Fol. I33V, Weitzmann-Fiedler, loc. cit., p. 33, fig. 6. It appears to have been written in Italy. I am grateful to Prof. K. Weitzmann for the photograph. It does not seem possible to associate the figures in the Bible from San Millain with specific saints. By analogy with the Byzantine practice of representing Mark with Peter and Luke with Paul, the bearded figure of the Luke page may be Paul. But Paul is portrayed in the initial of ii fol. 278 of the Bible from San Millhn as a balding figure. The bearded figure of the Mark page would not seem to be Peter, since in the Beatus example cited he is associated with John. In the manuscripts published by Weitzmann-Fiedler we see that Peter could be associated with either Mark or John. 54 Hugo Buchthal, 'A Byzantine Miniature of the Fourth Evangelist and Its Relatives', Dumbarton Oaks Papers, xv, I961, pp. 129-39. 55 Koehler (loc. cit., pp. I7-18) specifically rejected the relevance to the frontispieces of the Ghent Gospels of the Byzantine icono- graphy of accompanied Evangelists (pub- lished by Baumstark, see n. 48). He was justified in denying the connection of the Ghent portrait of John with the Byzantine miniatures ofJohn with the scribe Prochorus, a subject apparently dating from no earlier than the tenth century (K. Weitzmann, in Studies in Art and Literature for Belle da Costa Greene, ed. D. Miner, Princeton, I954, pp. 372-73), but less so in disclaiming the rele- vance of the other Evangelist portraits pub- lished by Baumstark on the grounds that the standing figures in the Ghent miniatures do not have nimbi, and therefore could not be Peter or Paul. If they are Evangelists, as Koehler believed them to be, they should have an equal right to the nimbus. 56 Neuss, Apokalypse, p. 237- 57 F.

I I d). The Evangelist is shown seated before a landscape which includes plant forms and an atmospheric back- ground but no architecture. The landscape is seen through parted curtains tied to Corinthian columns in the Carolingian examples, pilasters in the Beatus miniatures. The columns support a flat, patterned arch and the area reserved between it and the curtains holds a beast symbol. The setting in the Ghent Gospels parallels that of some of the Beatus portraits62 in dividing the background by means of a central column. Otherwise this earliest example of the iconography of the accompanied Evangelists known in Western art differs from the formula we have described. There is no arcade and an architectural rather than a landscape background is employed. Thus it is closer to the Byzantine tradition of Evangelist portraiture, whereas the Beatus miniatures seem to be clearly within the Western tradition. On the basis of the type of decorative frame and the rather soft modelling of the figures Koehler believed the frontispieces of the St. Livinus Gospels were directly copied from a Roman model of the sixth century.63 The double portraits of the Spanish manuscripts would seem to be taken from another adaptation of the same subject. We are left with the problem of the immediate models for the Spanish iconography. Do they perpetuate a tradition introduced by Biblical manu- scripts imported directly from Italy to Spain, or were they known there through Carolingian intermediaries? Neuss, firmly committed to a late- eighth-century date and a Mediterranean, preferably North African, proven- ance for the original Beatus pictures,64 never seriously considered the latter 59 Autun, Bibl. de la Ville, MS. 3, E.

See, e.g., Carl Nordenfalk, Early Medieval Painting, p. 16 1; M. Schapiro, Art News, lxi, Jan. 1963, pp. 36, 49-50. Some of the pictures are alluded to in the text of the Commentary (Neuss, op. cit., p. 237, n. I), yet these references are not uniformly present in the various copies. Sanders (H. A. Sanders, Beati in Apocalypsin Libri Duodecim [Papers and Monographs of the American Academy in Rome, vii], Rome, 1930) chose to omit them. The only recent extensive general discussions of the illustrations of the Commentaries have been those of Gonzalo Menindez Pidal ('Mozarabes y asturianos en la cultura de la alta edad media', Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia, cxxxiv, 1954, pp. 137-291 ; Sobre miniatura espanola en la alta edad media, Madrid, 1958). In the latter, a privately printed dis- course read to the Real Academia de la Historia, he attempted (pp. 23ff.) to reconcile Neuss's belief that the Beatus illustrations were fully constituted in Beatus' lifetime with the position of Manuel G6mez Moreno (Iglesias mozdrabes, Madrid, 1919, P- 362; Ars Hispaniae, iii, Madrid, 1951, p. 399) that Magius, the illuminator of the older Morgan Library Commentary, was the inventor of the Apocalyptic imagery as it appears in the Beatus manuscripts. His is a middle position in which Magius appears as a renovator, espe- cially through colour techniques learned in the Arabic part of the peninsula ('Mozarabes</page><page sequence="20">8o JOHN W. WILLIAMS possibility. However, the miniatures of the Beatus tradition should be con- sidered individually and the likelihood of Northern, or at least Western, sources of various dates should be taken into account. Certain details in the Spanish frontispieces differ from the Carolingian depictions of the seated Evan- gelists. The high-backed wooden seat of the Beatus representations is closer to the one shown in the miniatures of the Codex Aureus than it is to the heavy backless seat which is customarily used in the Carolingian manuscripts.65 Again, the representations in the Codex Aureus agree with the Beatus minia- tures in dividing the symbol of the Evangelist from the lower part of the picture by means of a broad decorative band. In the Carolingian representa- tions this division is accomplished simply by means of the rod which supports the curtains. Yet the influence of Carolingian illumination in the Peninsula has recently been emphasized66 and it is probably through this channel that the iconography of the Evangelists with Witnesses reached the Spanish scrip- toria. It is significant that the inscriptions which accompany the Beatus frontispieces, lines from the Carmen Paschale of Sedulius,67 are also associated with Carolingian Evangelist portraits. While it is true that these inscriptions first occur in the Stuttgart Gospels of the Tours School,68 where the repre- sentations of the Evangelists do not employ the arcade formula found in the Palace School, later Carolingian manuscripts from other Carolingian scriptoria combine the Sedulius inscription with the arcade setting.69 Likewise, a Caro- lingian source is suggested by the full-length beast form of the Evangelist symbol appearing above the Evangelists in the Beatus miniatures. While this is the form commonly encountered in Carolingian Canon Tables and Evan- gelist portraits, the anthropomorphic type usually appears in Spanish minia- tures. It would seem likely that the frontispieces for the Gospels were not found in Spanish Bible illustration before the tenth century when the icono- graphy of the Evangelists with Witnesses would have been introduced in the Peninsula through some Carolingian Gospel. By this time the Castilian tradi- tion was split into two branches, the one represented by the Bible from San y asturianos', pp. 226-27). Not even the date of this important manuscript is securely deter- mined. G6mez Moreno proposed a reading of 926 for the ambiguous colophon, Neuss one of 922. The date towards the middle of the century recently suggested by Nordenfalk (op. cit., p. 168) merits serious consideration. 65 The portraits of Mark and Luke in Munich-Gotha i 21 also employ the high- backed chair. Boeckler has proposed an early model for this pair of miniatures (Miinchner Jahrbuch, 1952/53, pp. 122, 125, 127, figs. 4, 7). 66Nordenfalk (op. cit., p. 163) acutely stresses the stylistic impact of Northern art on Spanish illumination beginning with the period 930-40. The distinctly Carolingian character of the initials of the earlier Morgan Commentary was noted by G6mez Moreno (Iglesias mozdrabes, p. 362) and analysed and confirmed by Jacques Guilmain in his studies of aspects of the decoration of this and other tenth-century Spanish manuscripts (Art Bul- letin, xlii, 1960, pp. 211-18; Speculum, xxxv, 1960, pp. 17-38; Scriptorium, xv, 1961, pp. 23- 35). Recognition of a Northern derivation for the iconography of the Beatus manuscripts has so far been limited to the Majestas as found in the Gerona Beatus and other tenth- century manuscripts, which, as Walter Cook demonstrated (Art Bulletin, vi, 1923, pp. 38ff.), was based on a Tours School prototype.

An iconographic parallel for the miniatures of the angels presenting the Gospels (P1. i i c) is also encountered in Northern art in the eighth-century Gospels in Trier (P1. I2d).70 Here the archangels Michael and Gabriel, clasping staves, are depicted holding a tablet with the Incipit of Matthew. As with the Evangelist frontispieces the Beatus versions (P1. I2c) offer a better record of the archetype. The Spanish angels hold spears rather than staves, but like the Trier angels they stand in front of a landscape, and in some Beatus miniatures there is a framework which appears to be related to the support for the tablet in the Trier miniature.7" Goldschmidt believed the representation of the archangels was derived from a Byzantine prototype.72 Both types of Gospel frontispiece in the San Millan Bible, then, represent a Western adaptation of a Byzantine prototype. It is impossible to say whether or not the idea of confronting the two on opposing pages originated in Spain. Perhaps the arcade of the angel pictures was added there to bring it into harmony with the Evangelist miniatures. Whereas the full-length beast in the latter seems to derive from the Carolingian prototype, the bust-length anthropomorphic symbol of the Beatus angel pages corresponds to the tradi- tional Spanish iconography. 70 Domschatz 6I (1i34), fol. 9r, ibid., pl. 7.

Josiah stands before a low masonry structure having a gilded upper border. A double row of heads indicates files of figures standing behind it. I have chosen to interpret the miniature as representing the men of Bethel standing behind the 'sepulchre of the man of God' mentioned in verse 17. It is possible, however, that the picture illustrates in a very literal fashion verse 20, which it immediately follows ('And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them.. .'). The rows of heads would not represent Josiah's audience standing behind a sepulchre, but the heads of the slain priests upon an altar. The appear- ance of the faces, with their open eyes directed towards Josiah, does not en- courage this latter interpretation. 'The Sepulchre of Josiah' (4 Kings xxiii, 30).
