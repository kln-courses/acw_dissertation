<plain_text><page sequence="1">Trickfilm/Chicago '75 Most curators of the Art Institute labor to convince the public that art can be enjoyable. The Film Center has the opposite assignment: to illustrate that enjoyable films can be art. The presentation of TRICKFILM/CHI- CAGO '75 is an effort to fill this assignment. It is an exhibition of short animated and special-effects films on ten consecutive evenings in October, from Friday the I7th through Sunday the 26th. Several international guests have been invited to appear with retrospective programs of their work; a catalogue will be published to accompany the show. The title of the exhibition is derived from trick- filme, the term used by Europeans since the beginning of cinema history to describe special films that were not shot in real time (i.e. when the action on the screen takes the same amount of time as it does in real life). In addition to drawn and puppet animation, trickfilms would include any film shot in slow-motion, pixillation, or reverse action, and any film not shot by camera but produced by computer or direct alteration of film stock. This survey of techniques and special effects will define the wide creative scope possible in film, the art medium of the twentieth century. TRICKFILM Will also include the historical and na- tional developments of the animated film. The naive charm of the anthropomorphic creatures whose antics entertained the American moviegoer in the twenties and thirties will be contrasted to the dark humor of the animated socio-political statements made in Eastern Europe in the sixties and seventies. Historical perspec- tive will show that this popular artform is a running commentary on social history. Changing attitudes about sexuality, violence, patriotism and prejudice are clearly documented in the animated films. Betty Boop was the only cartoon vamp, but Mickey Mouse was the first of a legion of invincible beings who bolstered the ego of the audience. In Mickey's early life he wasn't as pure of thought and deed as he later became. The changes in Disney Studios are a mirror of the times. The state of the art of animation today will also come under scrutiny. A wide selection of work by new talents and students will be presented. There will even be one program devoted to the energetic and primitive efforts of children making animated films. These ani- mations by children will be shown on Thursday, Oc- tober 23, in the Price Auditorium of the Junior Mu- seum. All other programs in TRICKPILM/CHICAGO '75 are scheduled for Fullerton Hall. There will be two performances each evening at 5:30 and 7:30 for a $1.25 single admission for film programs and a $2.50 single admission for personal appearance programs. Series booklets of ten tickets for ten dollars will be on sale. Complete schedules of films will be available at the museum information desk be- ginning October i. Recorded Film Center program in- formation is available by dialing 443-3737 any time. The Film Center is sponsored by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and partially supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, a federal agency, and the Illinois Arts Council, an agency of the state.
