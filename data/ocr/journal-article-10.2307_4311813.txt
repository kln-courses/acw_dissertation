Simpson How Rustam Killed White Dlv: An Interdisciplinary Inquiry In June 2001 the authors joined forces to investigate the dynamics of poetry and painting in Firdausi's Shabnama. Our expectation was that by linking our individ- ual expertise and perspectives as literary historian (JWC) and art historian (MSS) to our separate experiences in studying the Shahnama as a work of literature and as a work of art, we would arrive at a greater understanding of the ways that verses and pictures interact in illustrated manuscripts of Firdausi's epic.1 The Shahnama's significance as a cultural foundation document is clearly reflected in the visual arts of medieval Iran and the Persianate koine. By at least the twelfth century, monuments and objects of many kinds had begun to incorpor- ate Firdausi's verses and scenes within their decor.2 As a work of literature, the epic's impact was naturally greatest on the Persian arts of the book, as evidenced, for instance, by the carefully-calligraphed and illuminated volume of 614/1217, discovered not long ago in Florence and quickly identified as the earliest dated copy of the text.3 The end of the thirteenth century, traditionally regarded as the formative period of manuscript illustration (a.k.a. miniature painting) in Iran, also marks the start of the long history of Sbahnama illustration.

For the orality of Firdausi's epic, see Kumiko Yamamoto, The Oral Back- ground of Persian Epics: Storytelling and Poetry (Leiden and Boston, 2003). Art historians have also touched on the probable oral origin of medieval epic imagery, although the subject certainly deserves further study.

Art historians have produced valuable studies of paintings in Shahnama manuscripts, but, with few exceptions, have treated the text as ancillary. For their part, literary scholars, whose efforts have concentrated largely on establishing and studying Firdausi's ur-text, have ignored illustrated Shahnama manuscripts, or at least over- looked the presence of paintings in such manuscripts because, as productions of later centuries, these works appear to be of little or no ostensible literary value.5 Thus it seemed to us that there was room for a study that attended simultaneously to the verbal and visual components of illustrated Shahnama manu- scripts and that looked at text and image as equal partners, as it were, in the long history of Persian book production. This article summarizes how we undertook this research project and highlights some of the intellectual and procedural issues 6 we faced in the course of our combined investigation. Framing the Project and Probkm Research projects involving interdisciplinary collaboration do not seem to be the norm in literary studies and art history, let alone within other areas of the human- ities. At least, this is the conclusion we reached when, at the outset of our project, we surveyed the scholarly literature in search of possible methodological models. At best, it seemed to us that scholars in cognate disciplines might take up 4Jill Norgren and Edward Davis, eds., Preliminary Index of Shab-Nameb Illmstrations (Ann Arbor, 1969). Although unpaginated and distributed only in mimeographed form, this first systematic attempt to compile a corpus of illustrated Shabeama manuscripts remains an invaluable research tool. It now can be supplemented by the Sbabnama Project, an on-line database of Shabnama illus- trations, launched in fall 2004 under the direction of Charles Melville (Cambridge University) and in collaboration with Robert Hillenbrand (Edinburgh University).

For a consideration of recent Shahnama scholarship, see Simpson, "Shahnama as Text and Shahnama as Image," (as in note 2). 6MSS: The award of the Getty grant in June 2001, which marked the formal start of the project (its actual beginnings go back to fall 2000 when we began to prepare an application to the Getty), coincided with JWC's diagnosis of cancer. Notwithstanding his condition, he actively pursued research for this project and made many critical contributions to our collaborative undertaking through late summer 2003. JWC died on 7 November 2003, having already urged MSS to continue the work solo. Part of the explanation of the project's approach and structure that follows here also appears in the forthcoming article by Clinton and Simpson (as in note 1).

In the absence of any obvious prototypes, we evolved our own modus operandi, involving a stimulating mix of continual brainstorming, sometimes face-to-face and often electronically and/or telephonically, and more formal and periodic reporting to each other, to our colleagues (through jointly-authored and/or jointly-presented papers at scholarly gatherings) and to our sponsor. These exchanges initially resulted in a). The identification of a practical focus for our investigation, b). The determination of specific research tasks, and more importantly, c). The formulation of an operating premise. A. Selection of a focus manuscript. Fairly early on in our planning of this collaborative project, we had come to the realization that we might achieve better results-or at least have a more manageable project-if we framed a discussion of word and image in the Shahnama within the context of a single manuscript. Thus we selected as our focus or control manu- script a beautiful and intact volume of the poem belonging to Princeton University and known as the Peck Shahnama after the name of its former owner and donor (Islamic Manuscripts Third Series 310, Manuscripts Division, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library). In addition to its accessibility, high quality, and condition, the Peck Shahnama had several advan- tages for our purposes: it is a large-scale volume with an extensive pictorial program, consisting of forty-five full-page compositions distributed throughout the epic text, as well as double-page pictures at the beginning and end (the folios measure 47 x 32.5 cm and such size is always an asset when two people are looking together at a manuscript); it is dated 998/1589-90, by which time the practice of Shahnama illustration was well into its prime; and it was copied by the prolific scribe Qiwam ibn Muhammad who hailed from Shiraz, long a major center of Persian manuscript production. This is clearly where the Peck Shahnama was created, as can be ascertained from its codicological format and painting style, including that of its extensive illumination, as well as the name of its scribe.8 Thus our focus manuscript had a secure historical place and a recognizable artistic pedigree. 7Parallel trajectories are followed in, for instance, Oleg Grabar and Cynthia Robinson, eds., Islamic Art and Literature (Princeton, 2001).

Subsequent circumstances obliged us to scale back.9 So from the Peck Shahnama's program of forty-five illustrations we selected a sample of twelve images, which we took to calling the project's "key set." In making our choices, we had several criteria in mind. First, we wanted a distribution of illustrations from throughout the epic, but with a slight weight- ing toward the first two-thirds of the text where the most familiar narratives appear. Second, we tried to achieve a mix or balance of frequently and less- frequently illustrated scenes. And, finally, we included the one illustration that appears to be unique to the Peck manuscript.10 B. Specific research tasks. In addition to hands-on sessions with the Peck Shahnama, during which we shared our observations and ideas about the character of the key set illustrations, includ- ing the formal and iconographic features of their compositions, the role of their primary and secondary figures, and the physical and narrative relation between text and paintings, we pursued separate aspects of the project from our individual areas of expertise. JWC prepared an index that identifies all the manuscript's illus- trations (including those in the key set) on the basis of the adjacent text and located the "break line," that is, the line that immediately precedes the illustration, in the Dabir-Siyaqi edition of the text. He also compared the relevant text in the key set compositions with this and other more commonly cited editions by Bertels and Khaleghi-Motlagh as a basis for examining the relation of the Peck illus- trations to the text of the Peck manuscript."1 Finally, and perhaps most impor- tantly in terms of the project's overall goals, JWC analyzed Firdausi's visual cues, specifically the words and phrases that the poet used both to evoke the setting of his scenes and the physical appearance of his characters and to advance the action of his narrative. These investigations were later expanded into discussions of the complete epic context and content of each of the twelve key set illustrations, with consideration of the function of the illustrated scenes in the narrative. 9These circumstances included the fact that the Getty support, while generous, was only for a year instead of the two we had requested. Consideration of JWC's health also was a factor in our revision of the project's scope. 10Our determination of the distribution or rate of illustration throughout the Shahnama, as well as the degree of frequency-or infrequency as the case may be-of a scene's illustration was informed by the listings in Norgren and Davis (as in note 3) and confirmed more recently by the expanded Shahnama Project database. A discussion of all the key set scenes will appear in the project's final publication. 11Mohammad Dabir-Siyaqi, Shahnamah Abu al-Qasim Firdawsi, 6 vols. (Tehran, 1335/1956); E. E.

She then created a compendium of Shahnama manuscripts for com- parison with the Princeton volume, including fourteenth- and fifteenth-century manuscripts that form part of the Peck Shahnama's historical background and six- teenth- and early seventeenth-century works that comprise its contemporary corpus.12 Particular attention was paid to Shahnama manuscripts made in Shiraz, since these are especially relevant for understanding the place of the Peck codex within the artistic tradition to which it most immediately and closely belongs. In identifying manuscripts for comparison, whether originating in Shiraz or elsewhere, the main criterion was that they had to contain at least one or more of our key set images. This compendium provided the map or blueprint for a first-hand examination of some seventy Shahnama manuscripts, as well as the study of other individual illustrations in published reproductions, with particular attention to the composition, iconography and text (both the placement and content of verses) of each comparative illustration. These examinations, in turn, made it possible for MSS to trace the pictorial history of each key set illus- tration from its earliest known representation through the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and into the early seventeenth century and to determine the existence of an illustrated standard or norm and/or variations on that norm. MSS prepared her findings both in a detailed and descriptive chronology of key set illustrations and in a summary of the primary characteristics of the pictorial history of each of our twelve key set images. Inevitably, there was some overlap or crossover of disciplinary boundaries and even duplication of effort in our work. For instance, in his study of visual cues in the Shahnama, JWC distinguished iconographic details in the Peck paintings that are specified or suggested by Firdausi's verses from those that are not. In other words, he sought to determine which elements in the illustrations are text- based and which seem to be extra-textual (that is, the paintings' textual idiosyn- crasies), and in the process commented on some general characteristics of Persian painting. For her part, MSS spent a great deal of time recording verses that appear in the various manuscripts she studied but that are absent from the Peck Shahnama and trying to determine the extent to which these "additional" verses might have effected the iconography of a given illustration. 12This is exactly the kind of work that the Shahnama Project database is intended to facilitate. In the absence of that resource (which only became available in preliminary form in October 2004), the initial identification of comparative manuscripts for this project relied primarily on the listings provided in Norgren and Davis, with the addition of Shahnama manuscripts identified in the past thirty or so years. Many of these have been published in exhibition, collection, and sale catalogues.</page><page sequence="6">176 Clinton &amp; Simpson C. Operating premise.13 Our project's point of departure is the premise that an illustrated manuscript of Persian poetry as exemplified by the Shahnama is a hybrid text that combines two distinct languages or discourses verbal and visual-each with its own development and narrative strategy. The verbal or literary language is, of course, that of the poet who controls the content of the text during the time of its composition, and who probably could not have envisioned the extent to which his literary production would be modified over the centuries of its transmission, including through the addition of pictures.14 The visual or rep- resentational language of an illustrated Shahnama volume is the work of the artist-or more precisely an artistic team usually consisting of a planner or designer who determined the codicological "look of the book,"15 including where its illustrations should appear and what they should represent; a scribe who transcribed the text (and in the process inevitably edited it through the addition, deletion and alteration of verses) and who also was responsible for leaving blank spaces for its illustration; and finally, the painter who created the compositions following the physical layout and pictorial program determined by designer, the spaces left and the verses written by the copyist, and last but not least, iconographic convention and invention.16 While the conjunction of verbal and visual modes of expression certainly results in an enhanced "audience experience" (and here the audience is the reader or viewer, another interested and involved party who deserves further con- sideration than we have been able to give in this project), the relation of word and image in such a hybrid work is anything but straightforward. Indeed, our research on the Peck Shahnama and other illustrated Shahnama manuscripts has 13 Some of what follows reprises Jerome W. Clinton, "Ferdowsi and the Illustration of the Sbah- nameb," in Grabar and Robinson, pp. 58-59. A more complete exposition appears in Clinton and Simpson, "Word and Image" (forthcoming, as in note 1). In formulating our operating premise, we did try to take account of general, established theories about narrative, narration, narrativity, and text-image relations, as well as recent studies of certain works of western medieval, mostly secular, literature, such as the Roman de la Rose. See, for instance, Wallace Martin, Recent Theories of Narrative (Ithaca and London, 1986); H. Porter Abbott, The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative (Cambridge, 2002); Kevin Brownlee and Sylvia Huot, eds., Rethinking the "Romance of the Rose:" Text, Image, Reception (Philadelphia, 1992). 14This raises notions of authorship in medieval Iran, a complex issue that lies beyond the scope of this project. Sufficed it to say that they were essentially non-proprietary and that while Firdausi remained and remains the recognized author of the Shahnama, many of the epic's verses, and even entire tales, were altered over time-something that is very clear in comparing even the earliest known thirteenth century copies and that has been the bane of modern editors seeking to establish Firdausi's ur-text. On this issue see Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh, "Statistics of Omitted and Spurious Versions in Six Manuscripts of the Shahnama" Studia Iranica 26 (1997): 17-45. 15We have borrowed this felicitous phrase from Elaine J. Wright, "The Look of the Book: Manuscript Production in the Southern Iranian City of Shiraz from the Early-Fourteenth Century to 1452," Ph.D. dissertation (Oxford University, 1997). 16For a succinct summary of the modus operandi of such an artistic team, see Robert Hillenbrand, "New Perspectives in Shahnama Iconography," in Hillenbrand, ed., Shahnama, pp. 3-4 (as in note 2).</page><page sequence="7">How Rustam Killed White Div 177 led us to understand that epic poetry and epic painting interact as much through competition as through complementarity. Complementarity lies in the fact that, whether in whole or in part, both media narrate the same events (actually paint- ings narrate only selected events) and each one by its very nature provides a type of information that is either absent from the other or present only in attenuated form: colorful and concrete representation of characters and settings in one comp- lement thematic context and dialogue in the other, to mention only very obvious examples. The competition between these two discourses arises from these very same textual and visual distinctions. Again to draw attention to the most obvious difference, narrative text is linear, drawing the reader forward from moment to moment. Paintings are anti-linear, arresting readers in their progression through the text and obliging them to stop and take in narrative imagery and iconography. In short, the whole history of illustrated Shahnama manuscripts may be likened to the production of alternative performances (in the case of the text) and interpret- ations (in the case of the paintings). It is the dynamic tension inherent in these varied productions and the similarities and differences-what also might be called convergence and divergence-between poetic and pictorial expression that is at the heart of this project. Our point of departure was a consideration of how poet and painter each undertake the task of the other. What is the visual aesthetic of the poet, whose collaboration with artists is both unintentional and unanticipated? How does the painter respond not only to the poet's visual cues, but also to the epic characterization, narration and themes? Is the painter telling the same story as the poet-or a different version of that story? The next part of this article is intended as a demonstration of how all this, or at least some of this, pertains to and plays out in the context of a specific illustration within the Peck Shahnama: folio 62 verso, "Rustam fights White Div."'17 It will also reveal the ways that we worked from our individual perspectives as literary historian and art historian, and, as previously implied, the ways that we, like poet and painter, each undertook the work of the other. The final section indicates how we revised our findings, refined our ideas, and coordinated our interpret- ations through discussion and dialogue. None of this, however, pretends to be a definitive statement about how Rustam fought and slew White Div during three and a half centuries of Shahnama illustration; rather, our aim here is to present a process of interdisciplinary investigation and inquiry. To backtrack momentarily, our work with the Peck Shahnama, particularly during the project's initial stages, involved direct examination of and conversa- tion about the manuscript. These sessions took place in the Special Collections reading room of Princeton's Firestone Library and were among the most rewarding and memorable moments in our collaboration, as we simultaneously 17Preliminary discussions and reproductions of this illustration appear in (Clinton, "Ferdowsi and the Illustration of the Shahnameh" (as in note 13) and Clinton and Simpson, "Word and Image" (forthcoming; as in note 1).</page><page sequence="8">178 Clinton &amp; Simpson interrogated the manuscript's illustrations and each other about what we had before our eyes. The sheer pleasure of looking together at a beautiful work of art and exchanging impressions and ideas sustained us through some of our sub- sequent and more mundane research tasks, as well as periods when we were not able to work directly together. Although our discussions were never recordedper se (although that might not have been a bad idea!), they did result in summary descriptions of each of our key set illustrations. That of Rustam fighting White Div follows now, as a prelude to the analyses that constitute the primary sub- stance of this article. Description of Peck Shahnama, Folio 62 Verso: "Rustam fights White Div," The composition has three lines of text incorporated into the panel at the top of the picture plane and three lines in the bottom panel for a total of twelve verses. A similar arrangement appears throughout the illustrated folios in this manuscript. The scene is set in a landscape made up of two planes: the foreground consists of a very large black cave, with a separate oval entrance at the right, surrounded by blue and mauve rocks. The inner lip of the cave features two low and leafless bushes; the outer edge of rocks is marked at right with a large plane tree (surrounded and occupied by divs), in the middle by a small tree with bushy foliage, and at left with a medium-sized plane tree (to which Aulad is bound). The upper, leafy branches of both plane trees project in the folio's upper margins. The secondary or background plane resembles a pink hillside, dotted with small tufts of grass. The horizon line is rendered in irregular folds. The sky is gold and there are two knotted clouds at the left side. Rustam and White Div dominate, although they do not entirely fill, the cave, and both are positioned with their bodies parallel to the picture plane and their heads in three-quarter pose. Rustam, at right, is mustachioed and with a double-pointed brown beard. He wears a brown tiger-skin robe, blue-under robe and pants, a snow-leopard helmet with silver and gold ear guards and neck flap, and a tall, spotted feather plume, a gold scabbard hanging from his gold belt, silver and gold arm and knee guards, and boots with red uppers and green soles. Looking downward in seemingly intense concentration, he lunges forward toward White Div and extends his right arm and silver sword straight out to slash at his opponent's left leg above the knee. So as to insure freedom of movement, he holds up the outer edge of his tiger-skin robe with his left hand. White Div, at left, is at least a head taller and much bulkier than Rustam. His large body and head are spotted white and gray, and his fierce, muzzle-like facial features include large, fang-like teeth; a snout-like nose; gold, "flaming" eyes; long, floppy ears; and a pair of silver, antler-like horns at the top of his head. He wears a blue skirt with a red waistband and lining and grey hem; this garment is split in middle to reveal prominent genitals, while a skinny, dark tail swishes out from behind.

The div lunges towards Rustam in a kind of dancing position, his bare feet barely touching the ground. He reaches back with his right arm, the slender fingers curved at an odd angle as if for balance, and holds a large rock in his left hand. His left leg is bent and blood sprays out from the wound just above his left knee and down his calf. A large stone mace on a brown stick, resem- bling an enormous rattle, lies at an angle between his legs on the cave floor. Above and outside the cave to the left, Aulad, black bearded and with hands behind his back, is bound with a white lasso to the medium-sized plane tree at left. He wears a gold-brimmed crown-like cap, an orange robe, purple sleeves, blue underskirt and blue belt with gold clasps, and looks downward as if peering into the cave. Roan-colored Rakhsh and another bluish-gray horse, pre- sumably Aulad's, stand to the left. Next to the smaller, bushy tree in the center, a dark-gray div with curved horns looks to his right and up into the large plane tree where an orange div, wearing a blue skirt, perches in the forking branches. This demon looks down in turn towards a blue-skinned companion wearing a red skirt and climbing up the tree trunk. Two other divs, one yellow and the other pink, stand at the tree's base, and two more divs lie beneath the entrance to the cave at the lower right. One large, brown creature has been cut through at the waist just above his orange skirt. He remains alert enough, however, to stretch out his left arm and cradle the chin of a yellow companion, seemingly closer death and partly obscured by the bottom text panel. Poetic Narrative (JWC)18 Context and action The most frequently illustrated event in the entire Shahnama is Rustam's battle with White Div (div-i sepid or sefid), the seventh and last of the challenges, or khans, that the hero must face in his journey to rescue the Iranian shah Kay Kavus and his troops who have been taken captive and blinded by White Div during an ill-advised and ill-fated invasion of the neighboring territory of Mazandaran. In the fifth khan, Rustam captures a local warlord named Aulad, and this hostage becomes his guide through the region. At the start of the sixth khan, Rustam slays Arzhang Div, who is 18JWC based the following account primarily on the version of Rustam's fight with White Div in Dabir-Siyaqi, 2:313-318 and also with reference to A.G. Wamer and E. Wamer, trans., The Shah- nama of Firdausi done into English, 2 (London, 1906), 52-62. Overall, the Dabir-Siyaqi edition com- prises many more verses-and thus more narrative detail-than those in Bertels, 2:106-110 and Khaleghi-Motlagh, 2:41-45.

The stalwart warrior then enters the cave for an emotional reunion with his compa- triots. This concludes the journey part of Rustam's rescue mission, but he still must defeat the demon army of Mazandaran to ensure the captives' release and safe return to Iran. Kay Kavus advises Rustam to proceed swiftly and secretly against White Div, the leader and chief hero of the enemy forces. Once White Div learns of Arz- hang's death, the shah warns he will quickly assemble a huge army and go on the attack. In his counsel, Kai Kavus begins to set the scene visually for Rustam's coming battle by telling him that his way lies through seven mountains that are filled with warlike demons as ferocious as leopards. He also says that White Div himself lives in a dark and terrible cave. Kay Kavus adds another incentive for Rustam to slay the div when he explains that physicians have prescribed three drops of the blood of White Div as a cure for the blindness that has afflicted both him and his army since their ignominious defeat. This point is worth noting since the critical need of the shah and the army for White Div's blood helps determine the decisive moment in the coming battle. There are several stages, or moments, in the episode in which Rustam encoun- ters White Div. The first is a prologue. Rustam and his hostage-guide Aulad approach the enemy's cave and spy a host of divs surrounding it. Aulad counsels Rustam to wait until the sun is high when the divs will be sleeping because he then will have an easier time defeating them. Rustam accepts this advice. When the divs have fallen asleep, he binds Aulad to a tree to prevent the guide's escape, draws his sword, and charges the enemy, shouting his name aloud as a battle cry. The drowsy divs make feeble opponents, and Rustam is able to lop off all their heads in a trice. The episode's next action takes place inside the cave. It is so dark that White Div, here characterized as a sorcerer (jadu),19 is all but invisible. Rustam looks more carefully and sees a mountain-sized figure that obscures the interior of the cave. Rustam does not attack White Div at once, but first awakens him with a fierce shout. The ensuing battle is fought in a quick succession of moments usually contained in a single bait and rarely extending to two-that would seem to have illustrative potential. First, White Div charges Rustam with a millstone.20 In the second moment, Rustam, having recovered from this attack, strikes his opponent in the middle with his sword, and then hacks off the div's arm and leg.21 Despite this mutilation, White Div continues on the attack in the third moment, grappling with Rustam and attempting to throw him down. The two 19Warner and Warner 2:59.

With God's help, Rustam then gathers his strength and, in the fourth moment, throws the demon down so hard that he expires. Finally in the fifth moment, the Iranian hero draws his dagger, stabs White Div in the heart and carves out his liver. A single bait narrates these successive actions in graphic detail: "He stabbed him with his knife, cut out his heart / And tore his liver from his swarthy trunk.,"22 Notwithstanding that this violent progression culminates in the act most critical for the outcome of the nar- rative, almost all illustrations show Rustam stabbing White Div in the chest or abdomen rather than cutting out his heart or extracting his liver. Although this is where recountings of the haft khan generally end, Firdausi's narrative actually continues for more than two dozen verses. Having eviscerated White Div, Rustam exits the cave, frees Aulad and gives him his slain opponent's liver. (In the Dabir-Siyaqi edition of the Shahnama, Rustam offers lengthy prayers to Yazdan for his victory immediately after emerging from the cave.) Hero and hostage then set off to rejoin Kai Kavus and his men. En route Rustam bestows Mazandaran on Aulad, in return for his help as guide and in fulfillment of a promise made during the fifth khan. The rest of the seventh khan story narrates how Kai Kavus praises Rustam for his bravery and prowess, and how he and his troops regain their sight when blood from White Div's liver is dropped into their eyes. The liberated Iranians celebrate with a week of revelry, after which they lay waste the Mazandaran countryside, killing and pillaging, and agree to demand the capitulation of the enemy king. Visual cues According to Firdausi, the environs of the cave that serves as the White Div's lair are mountainous and chockablock with divs, most of whom Rustam will behead. Firdausi does not describe the physical appearance of these demon guards, but does say that they are terrifying. 4 The cave itself is pitch black, as is White Div whom the poet characterizes as "a hill of darkness" or "black mountain" (cho kubi siyah) and as having a dark face and white hair (rang-e shabab ruy-o 22The wordjigar, used in the second hemistych of this bait and translated here as liver, can stand for either heart or liver. The understanding of the function of these two organs in Firdausi's time requires further investigation.

In JWC's draft commentary on the haft kban, which forms the basis for the present account, he mentioned that, after removing White Div's liver, Rustam cuts off the creature's head and eventually presents it to Kai Kavus. This seems to be a misreading of Dabir-Siyaqi, 1:315, verse 760 in which Rustam's head is on the ground, during his lengthy prayers to Yazdan following his victory. I am grateful to Firoozeh Khazrai for reviewing these verses with me. 24Dabir-Siyaqi, 2:313, verse 711; Bertels, 2:106, verse 563; Khaleghi-Motlagh, 2:41, verse 552; Mohl, 1: 536, verse 594 (translated on p. 547 as "courageux"); Warner and Warner, 2:59 (where the divs are described as "valiant").</page><page sequence="13">How Rustam Killed White Div 183 chun shir muy).25 Thus, the "White" in White Div refers to his hair color, not his overall appearance, and "White Div" probably should be understood as a name, like "Red Barber," and not a description.26 His most distinctive feature, his enor- mous size, described in the fifth khan as like a mountain "with shoulders, breast and neck ten cords across" and essentially repeated here (albeit without such specific measurements), is reinforced yet again when Firdausi tells us that the div's "height and width filled at all the world."27 The only other details of White Div's appearance that Firdawsi mentions refer to his armor, comprising iron brassards and an iron helmet.28 The poet makes no mention of the homs, fangs, claws, leopard-like spots or jewelry that are recurrent features in illustrations of the scene. One of the few descriptive features that is iconic in the Shahnama is size. Thus, just as White Div's body is mountain-like, Rustam's huge body allows others to distinguish him from his companions on a number of occasions. So too it is Rakhsh's unusual size that makes him suited as Rustam's mount. In Persian book painting, however, the absence of perspective makes the presentation of relative size problematic, although in the Peck Shahnama White Div is clearly larger than Rustam. Lacking this marker, painters rely on others. Since facial fea- tures are generic both in the text and in painting, Rustam's tiger-skin cuirass (babr-e bayan; mentioned in the fifth trial although not in the seventh) becomes the one sure means of identifying him visually.29 In the fifteenth century, artists added a distinctive leopard or snow leopard's skull helmet, although this does not appear in the text. Rustam thus becomes not the physically dominant hero, but the one with a distinctive costume. As for Rakhsh, his size does not seem to have impressed itself on painters. They do, however, regularly depict Rustam's faithful steed as dappled or roan-colored, following Firdausi's descrip- tion of its coat as piebald or bay (burash, abrash).30 Both protagonists are severely wounded in the struggle and Firdausi tells us that the floor of the cave turns muddy with their blood.31 Gory mud and 25Dabir-Siyaqi, 2:314, verses 731 and 734; Bertels, 2:107, verses 583-84; Khaleghi-Motlagh, 2:42, verses 569-70; Mohl, 1:583, verses 612 and 615; Warner and Warner, 2:60. 26See Clinton, "Ferdowsi and the Illustration of the Shabnameh," 71-72.

They did, however, depict blood spurting from wounds, as with the White Div's severed leg in the Peck Shahnama, and ringing necks and trunks of decapitated and otherwise dying warriors, as in the div below the entrance to the cave in the Princeton manuscript. Another important aspect of the battle as recounted by Firdausi that does not make its way into the paintings is the psychological state of the two comba- tants. As they fight the poet takes us inside their thoughts, allowing each to express his sense of fear and desperation. Rustam famously says that if he sur- vives this day he will live forever. White Div not only fears for his life, but knows that even if he survives he will have no future as a warrior since he is hideously maimed and no one in Mazandaran, great or small, will wish to have anything to do with him. Rustam's piety, as recounted in the Dabir-Siyaqi edition, is another element of the struggle that is never depicted. When he exits the cave and the divs still assembled there have taken flight, Rustam disrobes, washes himself, looks for a clean place in which to pray and proceeds to offer lengthy and detailed thanks to Yazdan for his victory. Only after prayer does he return to Aulad, untie him and give him the div's liver for safekeeping. The haft khan episode offers a whole sequence of compelling and "illustratable" moments: Rustam and Aulad observe the divs guarding White Div's cave, Rustam slaughters the divs, Rustam comes upon White Div sleeping in the cave, White Div attacks Rustam with a millstone, Rustam slices White Div in the middle, Rustam hacks off his opponent's arm and leg, Rustam and White Div wrestle back and forth, Rustam lifts White Div up and then slams him down on the ground, Rustam stabs White Div in the heart and cuts out his liver, Rustam emerges from the cave triumphant and offers thanks to Yazdan, Rustam's untying Aulad and giving him White Div's liver, his reunion with the grateful Kay Kavus, and the breaking of the spell of blindness by anointing the eyes of the king and the king's men with the White Div's blood, the week- long celebration that followed, and the liberated Iranians' retaliation by laying waste to the land of Mazandaran. In the Peck Shabnama folio 62 verso, as in all the illustrations of this episode that I have seen, the focus is on the combat between the two principals, Rustam and White Div. Likewise, the paintings frequently invariably include Aulad and Rakhsh as part of the setting's background. Also as depicted in the Peck illustration, the scene often depicts the divs outside the cave, some slaugh- tered and some having fled into the trees for safety. 32Dabir-Siyaqi, 2:315-16, verses 756-98. MSS: Only the Dabir-Siyaqi edition includes this par- ticular moment. In the Bertels and Khaleghi-Motlagh editions, along with most of the comparative manuscripts included in this study, the narrative moves directly from the cave floor flooded with gore to Rustam's exit from the cave and return to Aulad.</page><page sequence="15">How Rusiam Killed White Div 185 Pictorial Narrative (MSS) The pictorial tradition for this most frequently illustrated of all Shahnama scenes begins in the Il-Khanid era, with the earliest known volumes of the epic with pictures, and continues through the seventeenth century and beyond. Well over one hundred examples of "Rustam fights White Div" are known today.33 Illustrated moments and actions Beginning with the 1330 Shahnama, the standard iconography for the haft khan episode, represented by ninety percent or so of the examples surveyed for this study, depict Rustam and White Div inside the creature's cave and near the end of their fierce combat. Rustam already has sliced at or cut off the div's leg and is in the process of stabbing his adversary in the chest or stomach. The div is invariably shown lying flat on his back, looking up at Rustam with wide-open eyes and grasp- ing fiercely onto his opponent's arm, back or neck-vident signs that the maimed creature continues to cling to life in the midst of his death throes. His severed limb, usually a leg or foot, seems to float or otherwise rests nearby. Rustam straddles or "crawls" up the div's legs, sticking the knife in its torso with one hand and holding it down at the neck or by an antler with the other. Outside the cave, Aulad is tied to a tree at the side, a seemingly passive bystander, while Rakhsh grazes or gazes about nearby, also without much apparent attention to his master's struggle. In addition, the exterior space features one or more of White Div's demon guards, often dead or dying. Those who have escaped Rustam's wrath react to their leader's plight with varying degrees of constemation and horror. Thus the scene implicitly relates to Rustam's actions in three separate verses (because White Div is flat on the ground and missing a leg) and explicitly depicts his actions in the critical verse: "He stabbed him with his knife, cut out his heart / And tore his liver from his swarthy trunk." Likewise, although this iconographic treatment literally represents a specific moment in the episode, it implies several preceding moments before Rustam entered the cave, including his binding Aulad with a lasso and his slaying of the guardian divs, as well as the harm he already has inflicted on White Div. So the iconography as a whole gives us a conflated or combined account of a series of poetic moments, including the various stages in the combat, in addition to a simultaneous view of interior and exterior settings, with what is depicted outside or beyond the cave resulting from actions that precede what is now taking place within. The identification of this particular moment as normative for the represen- tation of the haft khan does not mean, however, that the illustrative corpus 33As of December 2002, MSS had studied some 45 illustrations; by November 2004, that number had more than doubled, thanks to the Shahnama Project database, which includes many images that have been identified by Dr. Farhad Mehran, who also has investigated this scene in "The Break-line Verse: Link Between Text and Image in the First Small Shahnama," paper presented at the Shahnama conference, University of Edinburgh (March 2003).</page><page sequence="16">186 Clinton &amp; Simpson consists of a hundred or more identical paintings. In fact, there is a fair amount of compositional variation on the pictorial theme, and no two illustrations, not even those that clearly come from the same place at the same time, look alike or repli- cate one another. So, for instance, sometimes Rustam is on the left and the div is on the right, and sometimes their positions are reversed. Aulad and Rakhsh also migrate regularly from one side or edge of the picture plane to another.34 The most noteworthy and distinctive variations are iconographic and often occur in clusters of manuscripts from roughly the same period. Thus, a number of illustrations in volumes dating from the 1430s and 1440s show Rustam raising his knife or dagger in preparation for stabbing White Div.35 Although Firdausi does not specify this action, it is a logical prelude to the actual stabbing act. Other illustrations, dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, depict White Div with a severed arm as well as a severed leg, and a few show him with two severed legs, or a leg and a foot. Sometimes White Div even holds his own severed limb. One illustration, datable to circa 1580-85, includes an additional purplish arm at the top of the cave that does not belong to White Div who has retained both his appendages. There is a textual peculiarity to be noted here. In most of the manuscripts I have studied, the verse describing how Rustam sliced at White Div's extremities specifiesyeki ran vayeki pay: one thigh and one foot (i.e., parts of two legs or perhaps two parts of the same leg). In other volumes, however, the verse reads yeki dast vayeki pay: one hand and one foot (or an arm and a leg).36 The Peck Shahnama comprises another-and apparently unique variant: its comparable verse just says yeki pay. Interestingly, there appears to be very little, if any, correlation between the written word and the painted image. That is to say, illustrations where the text says thigh and leg may show precisely that-and are just as likely to depict a foot and a hand. The expansion of the picture plane to occupy most of the folio, so typical of sixteenth century Persian painting, provided more room for anecdotal details in these haft khan illustrations. Some of these relate to the epic narrative, such as multiplying the surrounding troops of divs, who mill and prance about excit- edly, climb trees (as in the Peck Shahnama), clutch at rocks, talk agitatedly with 34I tried to correlate these shifts with the recto and verso placement of the illustrations, but this turned out to be a futile exercise. 3sA complete listing of all the comparative illustrations, and their iconographic particulars, will appear in the project's final publication. Many already may be found in the Shahnama Project data- base. Some of illustrations in which Rustam raises his knife before stabbing White Div belong to Turkman-style manuscripts, and it remains to be seen if iconographic variation can be correlated with style. 36The various editions and translations used for this study share these variants. Mohl, 1:538, verse 619; Bertels 2:107, verse 587 and Khaleghi-Motlagh, 2:42, verse 573 give yeki ran vayeki pay, while Dabir-Siyaqi 1:314, verse 738 and Bertels 2, 107, n. 19 give yeki dast va yeki pay. Warner and Warner 2:60 states "hand and foot," and Davis 1:184 "one of his arms and one of his legs."</page><page sequence="17">How Rustam Killed White Div 187 one another, and occasionally make their way inside their leader's cave. One manuscript dated 1567 includes not only eight divs clustered outside the cave (including two climbing a tree), but four others, variously mutilated, dead and dying, within.37 Other additions are clearly extra-textual glosses, and appear, like the errant divs, within the cave's interior. These include bones, gourds, vessels of various shapes and sizes (ewers, jugs, vases, bottles, etc.), and even a platter containing two human heads. Perhaps the most peculiar and unexpected such addition is the young woman seated inside the cave and presumably watch- ing the conflict in a manuscript dating from the third quarter of the sixteenth century. The action that precedes the stabbing is rarely represented and is almost exclu- sively in manuscripts from the second half of the sixteenth century and later. These include moments when both protagonists are standing fully upright and sometimes wrestling with one another.38 In a few examples, Rustam is slicing off White Div's leg, as in the Peck Sbahnama, while in several others he lifts up his opponent in order to fling him down on the ground. Occasionally it is White Div who goes on the offensive, for instance, lifting up Rustam's leg as the hero raises his sword. A few illustrations depict White Div holding a rock, stick or a mace. Much more frequently, a mace is lying somewhere in the cave and generally in close proximity to White Div. The Peck Shahnama includes both details: White Div holds a rock in his left hand (partly obscured by Rustam's sword) and a staff with a large stone mace-head lies between the Div's legs on the cave floor. Curiously neither the Peck volume nor any of the others with this same iconographic feature contain any textual reference to a mace in the cave or to White Div holding a mace or about to strike Rustam with a stone, although the Dibar-Siyaqi edition does contain such a verse.39 What could be considered the climax of the haft khan-when Rustam extracts the liver from the Div's lifeless body is rarely illustrated. It does appear in what are generally regarded as the earliest known illustrated Shahnama manuscripts in very similar, albeit not identical, compositions with Rustam holding his knife upright in his right hand near the Div's face and pulling out the creature's brown liver with his left.40 37The presence of the div guardians seems to ebb and flow over the centuries of this scene's rep- resentation. Although they are present at the start of the pictorial tradition during the first part of the fourteenth century, they largely drop out of the picture, as it were, during the fifteenth century. They return to the scene in the early part of the sixteenth century and remain there for the duration of its history. 38Interestingly, the very verse (cited in note 29) describing the two adversaries wrestling is some- times missing. 39Dabir-Siyaqi 1:314, verse 735. Also Mohl, 1:538, verse 616. 4"Marianna S. Simpson, The Illustration of an Epic: The Earliest Shahnama Manuscripts (New York and London, 1979), figs. 27-28. The climax re-appears once again in the beautiful Shahnama made in 1440 for the Timurid prince Muhammad Juki, one of Timur's grandsons. Here Rustam seems to be pulling out the White Div's entrails with both hands. B.W. Robinson, "Unpublished Paintings from the Fifteenth Century Book of Kings," Apollo Miscelanny (1951), color plate.</page><page sequence="18">188 Clinton &amp; Simpson So it seems that the core visual iconography for the haft kban was fairly consist- ent and predictable from 1330 until the second half of the sixteenth century when a few new or original pictorial variants began to appear. The iconic image consists of Rustam stabbing White Div, after having cut off his leg and throwing him on the ground. Representations of previous and subsequent moments in the combat are rare. Thus the Peck Shahnama composition in which White Div charges at Rustam armed with a rock and Rustam counter-attacks by slicing at the creature's leg is quite anomalous within the pictorial tradition, although its overall setting and characterization subscribe to the norm. One final point to make here concerns the text. As already mentioned, in the illustrated Shahnama manuscripts I have studied, certain haft khan verses either exhibit noteworthy variants, such as the alteration of ran and dast, or are omitted altogether, such as the verse, found only in the Dibar-Siyaqi edition, in which White Div picks up a rock (or mace) to strike Rustam. In addition, the Peck Shahnama omits four verses that consistently appear in other manu- scripts, including the 1217 manuscript and the earliest illustrated copies of circa 1300, that expand upon the internal thoughts of White Div and Rustam in the middle of their combat.41 It remains to be determined if these verses are signifi- cant in terms of the poetic or pictorial narrative and especially if their absence from the Peck text has any bearing on the unusual iconography of the Peck painting. Setting and characterizations. In all manuscripts, the baft kban scene takes place in a landscape setting. The ear- liest illustrations, dating from circa 1300 to 1333, are small, and with room only for the cave outlined in a simple band of mountains. Still, they correspond to Firdausi's visual cue for the scene's location. As the painted surface increases from the latter part of the fourteenth century onwards, so does the mountainscape surrounding the cave. In addition to the Peck Shahnama, several other manu- scripts depict the cave as having a separate, usually oval, entry, as if the cave was a building with a doorway on the side. Although the combat between Rustam and White Div is always set in a land- scape, the setting occasionally lacks mountains, and even more surprisingly, some- times lacks the cave. Thus in several fifteenth and sixteenth century illustrations, the two combatants go at each other on a grassy plane, which considerably diminishes the dramatic effect of the cave's close and gloomy quarters. The representation of Rustam draws less on what Firdausi says about the hero in the haft khan and much more on preceding descriptions. Virtually all the known illustrations have Rustam wearing a robe with an animal-skin (usually tiger or leopard-skin) pattern or design, similar to that in the Peck Shahnama, which cor- responds to the poetic account of the hero's attire in his fifth trial. There Firdausi 41Bertels 2:107-08, verses 589, 590, 594, 595; Khaleghi-Motlagh 2:42-43, verses 575, 576, 578 n. 8; Dabir-Siyaqi, 1:315, verses 743, 744, 747, 749; Mohl, 1:538, verses 623, 624, 628 and 630.</page><page sequence="19">How Rustam Killed White Div 189 tells us that Rustam has an iron helmet, breastplate and shield. While Rustam rarely wears a breastplate or carries a shield in the paintings of his combat with White Div, he does sometimes have on arm and leg guards, as in the Peck Shahnama. The helmet is, however, a ubiquitous piece of the hero's equip- ment, although it changes style over time. Throughout the fourteenth and well into the fifteenth century, Rustam wears a metal helmet, sometimes with round ear guards, that would seem to correspond to the "iron helmet" described by Firdausi. Around the 1430s, this standard-issue helmet starts to be replaced by a fancier model in the form of a spotted snow-leopard's head (sometimes called a skull), complete with eyes. By the sixteenth century, this had become Rustam's common headgear and was often embellished with a plume, as in the Peck Shahnama. The fifth trial is also where Firdausi itemizes Rustam's weaponry, including a sword, lasso, mace, and spear.42 He repeats Rustam as being equipped with a mace in the sixth trial.43 In the final, seventh trial, Rustam uses his lasso to bind Aulad to the tree and his sword to decapitate the monster troops surround- ing White Div's cave. And, of course, in this episode, Rustam also employs a knife to stab White Div and cut out his heart and liver. The pictorial tradition of the hero's weapons in the haft khan is variable. In the Peck Shahnama, Rustam has drawn his sword from the sheath or scabbard hanging from his waist. In the standard scene of Rustam stabbing White Div, the hero generally has a sheathed sword (or a least the sheath) at his waist and often too a quiver full of arrows (and sometimes without arrows), accoutrements that Firdausi does not mention. The mace that appears in so many illustrations could be Rustam's, although its location within the cave suggests that artists understood the weapon as belonging to White Div. This is confirme(d by the various instances, previously noted, in which White Div actually holds the mace and occasionally lifts it as if to strike Rustam. The representation of White Div in the Peck Shahnama follows a well- established and consistent treatment that, however, has little to do with Firdausi's visual cues. Although the text uses exclusively animal imagery to characterize White Div, his actual appearance in the illustrations combines animal, human and fantastic features. In other words, he or it-is a kind of anthropomorphic hybrid. Furthermore, and notwithstanding the poet's explicit statement that White Div is dark-skinned, with a coal-colored (so black) face and a swarthy trunk and, further, that Rustam had trouble finding his adversary within the cave's murky interior, the demon monster is always depicted as light-skinned, usually white or greyish or mottled grey and white. This could, of course, have been an artistic response to Firdausi's simultaneous description of White 42 Bertels 2:101, verse 466 and 102, verse 492; Khaleghi-Motlagh 2:34, verse 455 and 36, verse 480; Mohl, 1:526, verse 488 and 528, verse 517; Warner and Warner, 2:54, 55, 56. 43Bertels 2:104, verses 517 and 525; Khaleghi-Motlagh 2:38, verses 507 and 515; Mohl, 1:552, verse 543 and 550; Warner and Warner, 2:57.</page><page sequence="20">190 Clinton &amp; Simpson Div as having a lion's mane, suggesting light-colored hair.44 It may be just as likely that this is the way that artists dealt with the counter-pictorial impossibility of painting a dark-skinned div in the dark depths of a cave.45 So it would seem that White Div's very name provided poetic license for the creature to be depicted as all white-a telling instance of Firdausi's text being subverted out of visual necessity. Certain of White Div's other characteristics, such as his fang-like teeth and claw-like hands and feet, correspond to Firdausi's description of demons in other Shahnama episodes, while his gold jewelry could be a modifi- cation of the armor mentioned in the haft khan narrative. Yet another noteworthy aspect of the creature's physique-his prodigious private parts-do not seem to derive from the text.46 In any event, White Div exhibits most of these attributes in the earliest known Shabnama manuscripts and retains them all throughout the epic's pictorial history. The one aspect of White Div's representation that seems more variable is his size, which we know from the text to be as large as a hill or mountain. In the stan- dard scene of White Div being stabbed by Rustam, his enormous dimensions are somewhat masked by the fact that he is always lying on the ground and more-or- less underneath Rustam. In these many cases, White Div looks no larger (albeit at the same time no smaller) than Rustam. In the few examples, like the Peck Shah- nama, where both protagonists are upright, artists could more easily depict White Div's impressive height and width, by having him tower over Rustam. The secondary figures in the haft khan illustrations have their own pictorial idiosyncrasies. Aulad, for instance, is literally a marginal character, being invari- ably tied to a tree at the side of the picture, and sometimes he is missing from the scene altogether. His visual identity does evolve over the centuries, however. He looks quite ordinary in fourteenth and fifteenth century representations, initially bareheaded and wearing a short tunic and high boots, and gradually changing into a longer robe and a helmet or turban. His status seems shift in about the 1540s, and many sixteenth century illustrations often dress him in fancy robes with gold designs and a cap-like crown (or crown-like cap) with a bejeweled brim and gold finial. If truth be told, however, this could have resulted as much from overall stylistic changes in Persian painting during the Safavid period as from a greater artistic appreciation of the critical role that Aulad played as Rustam's guide during his rescue mission, including directing the hero to White Div's lair, and of his subsequent appointment by Rustam as ruler of Mazandaran. 44Most manuscripts read chan shir muy. The 1217 manuscript, however, substitutes barf for shir, which is even more explicit in terms of the div's hair color. This variant is given in Khaleghi- Motlagh 2:42, verse 569. 45Interestingly, the early Shahnama illustrations of circa 1300 (see note 40) represent the cave's interior as light. 46The splitting of White Div's skirt to expose his genitals, as in the Peck Shahnama, seems to be a sixteenth century development.</page><page sequence="21">How Rurtam Killed White Div 191 Illustrated Shahnama manuscripts from the fourteenth century onwards consist- ently depict Rustam's faithful steed, Rakhsh, as dappled or piebald, following Firdausi's characterization of the horse as abrash. In representations to the haft khan, however, Rakhsh is often partly hidden behind mountains or cut off by the edge of the picture plane, so his appearance could not have been a great preoccupation to or challenge for artists. Furthermore, like Aulad, he is some- times an absent presence. This may be because he did not play an active role in this particular adventure or that his relation to Rustam was so evident that it was not actually necessary to depict him. As for the guardian divs around White Div's cave, painters generally treat them as smaller versions of White Div, down to their gold accessories. The major difference between these creatures and their leader is that they are invariably polychrome, and come in great variety of primary colors from yellow to blue to green, as in the Peck Shahnama. This coloration may have been a way of diminishing their importance: no matter how fearsome their aspect it is hard to be too frightened of bright pink monsters Issues and Dialogue (JWC and MSS) While it is no longer possible to reconstruct the specifics of our various working sessions (nor, more's the pity, to recapture their spirited give-and- take), certain recurring points and problems remain vivid. Here are some of the questions we asked each other-often more than once-and some of the reactions and responses we proposed, albeit in much more structured form than originally expressed at the time. Also, and as we realized then, our exchanges were more exploratory than conclusory, and hardly exhausted the interpretive possibilities. Why is Rustam's fight with White Div the most frequently illustrated scene in the Shahnama? What accounts for its popularity? What is it about this story that seems so emblematic of the Shahnama or of Rustam's adventures? JWC's initial thought: The trial seems to hark back to an earlier stage of mankind's development when, as recounted by Firdausi, mankind was pitted against monsters. Think of how Gayumars, the first shah in the Shahnama lineage, and his son Siyamak and grandson Hushang had to fight against the demon army of the malevolent Ahriman, or how Fairdun overcame the evil usurper Zahhak. MSS: So painters and patrons recognized Rustam's mission to Mazandaran in general as another, protracted instance of the primal struggle of good versus evil and his seventh trial in particular as the culmination of that struggle, one that could show good's triumph in graphically dramatic fashion. The seventh trial also culminates in the rescue of the Iranian monarch and his restoration to the Iranian throne. So it is a visual allegory for the poem's leitmotif. JCW subsequent, more considered reaction: The reason this question gnaws at me so much is because Firdausi actually signals the essential meaning of Rustam's</page><page sequence="22">192 Clinton &amp; Simpson mission to Mazandaran in the second khan rather than the seventh.47 In that episode, Rustam and Rakhsh together confront not a human or demonic foe, but a natural peril-a wide and arid desert-that puts them both in danger of dehydration. When Rustam realizes his life-threatening situation, he asks God for assistance in terms that make clear that he is here acting solely in the service of Iran and that the need to do so arises from a failure of moral judgment on the part of Kay Kavus. Just at that moment a well-fed ram passes by and Rustam follows it to a spring. Once there, the ram disappears, and Rustam realizes that it was no mere flesh and blood animal but a sign from God. God has heard Rustam's prayer, and has agreed to make him the agent of Kay Kavus's rescue. The second adventure actually reflects a pattern of behavior that recurs throughout the long and eventful reign of Kay Kavus. The shah resists guidance, behaves foolishly, and brings disaster on himself and Iran. Rustam, who is guided and protected by God, must rescue the shah, often at great risk to himself. It is this strange symbiosis, so fraught with tension for both parties, that energizes several of the greatest stories of the Shahnama. In short, the second adven- ture the first in fact that is truly Rustam's since Rakhsh is the hero of feat number one provides the essential meaning of the haft khan and the only one that does much more than establish the remarkable physical prowess of Rustam: indeed, it establishes his piety and moral authority. Painters evidently saw the haft khan quite differently, and violent episodes that best display Rustam's martial prowess receive the lion's share of painterly attention, including trials one, three, four, five, six and especially seven.49 The second feat when Rustam prays for deliverance from the desert and receives a sign from God in the form of a ram who leads Rostam to a spring, is never depicted. Instead, there is a lone instance of Rustam washing Raksh in the spring and two illustrations in which the hero finds a spring and hunts an onager.50 These are the scenes that are literally depicted and reveal the extent to which the critical text was ignored or misunderstood by Shahnama painters, who missed the spiritual content of the poem completely. Or rather, they may have seen it, but were obliged to ignore it, something that may have happened with other, artisti- cally-overlooked sections of the epic poem. Why does the Peck Shahnama illustrate a moment in the haft khan that precedes the stan- dard scene of Rustam stabbing White Div? JWC/MSS: There may be a technical or mechanical explanation for this. We know from the researches of Farhad Mehran that the break line verse for the typical haft khan illustration is when Rustam stabs White Div with a knife, cuts out the creature's heart, and tears 47See Clinton and Simpson, "Word and Image" (forthcoming, as in note 1). 48Bertels, 2:92-94; Khaleghi-Motlagh, 2:23-26; Mohl, 2:513-517; Warner and Warner, 2:46-47; Davis, 1:174. 49This has been more than confirmed by the Shahnama Project database. 50Norgren and Davis, see reference for Warner and Warner 11:47.</page><page sequence="23">How Rustam Killed White Div 193 out his liver. In the majority of illustrations, this verse appears in the line just above the painting. MSS: Of course this was hardly by accident, because the manuscripts had been planned so that the scribes copying out the text would leave a space for a painting after that particular, critical verse. JWC: But in the Peck Shahnama, this verse is the last one at the bottom of folio 62 verso, and the break line verse in the third line at the top of the painting recounts how White Div attacked Rustam. MSS: Perhaps the Peck painter felt that this moment wouldn't make an appropriate illustration since White Div is the villain. So instead he showed the action narrated in the preceding verse when Rustam lops off White Div's leg. We would have to check if this same verse appears in the break line in the couple of other illustrations that depict the same moment. JWC/MSS: What about a more nuanced or ideological explanation, one that gives someone (the manuscript's patron, designer or painter) more credit for understanding the moment's import? This particular moment in the haft khan involves a combat between two equals, both of whom have reason to fear for their lives. Rustam has maimed White Div by cutting him through the middle and lopping off his leg, and yet the wounded monster fights on, "As though he were a noble elephant or raging lion." The painter stresses White Div as a worthy adversary by making him noticeably larger than Rustam. At the same time this disproportion makes Rustam seem vulnerable, a position reinforced by his downward stare. JWC: And this fits with an ancient storytelling technique that a hero has to fear for his life at some point. MSS: Yet the denouement or outcome of the battle is never in doubt, right? So the painting does not have to show Rustam's triumph. Rather it represents what he had to overcome in order to triumph. In a sense it is about heroic process rather than product, and thus responds in a very perceptive way to Firdausi's own strategy for narrating the triumph of good over evil. In what other way(s) does the Peck painting reinforce the poetic themes? JWC/MSS: The demon guards outside and above the cave remind us that Rustam had to reach White Div's lair by passing through mountains teaming with these crea- tures and that he had to kill a whole throng of them before he could proceed with his mission. They also reinforce the cleverness of Aulad, who otherwise, being tied to a tree, looks pretty powerless, since it was by following his advice and waiting until the sun was up and the div warriors had fallen asleep that Rustam was able to finish them off and move on to find and fight White Div. The two dead and/or dying divs at the bottom right are evidence of Rustam's success in that phase of the combat. The five others, especially the two in the tree, reinforce the idea that, while the divs may be terrifying in principle, in practice they are terrified of Rustam. There is also a little landscape detail here of note. The two gnarled and leafless bushes growing at the top and bottom of the cave echo White Div's antlers and contribute to the setting's menacing atmosphere as described by Firdausi.</page><page sequence="24">194 Clinton &amp; Simpson What about the verses that are missing in the Peck manuscript?51 MSS: When I started to notice these verses while examining our comparative manuscripts, I saw them as being additions to Firdausi's text. But since they appear in so many volumes, it probably would be more accurate to recognize them as having been omitted from the Peck. They consist of two pairs of successive verses. Interestingly, pair one follows the verses in the Peck break line: one describes action (how Rustam and White Div tore at each other's skin and flesh and turned the cave floor muddy with their blood:) and the other introspection (Rustam saying to himself that if he can survive this day he will live forever). So perhaps the scribe dropped them because he already knew that they would not be consequen- tial for the illustration. The second pair comes between the verse when Rustam lifts White Div up and throws him down and when he stabs White Div with his knife and extracts his liver and reflects the protagonists' respective emotional states ("White Div said to himself, 'If I get rid of Rustam today then I will be safe.' Through God's power Rustam struggled on in pain and with all his being"). MSS subsequent consideration: Perhaps the Peck scribe skipped over these because they interrupted the narrative action. In any event, none of these verses seem to have the pictorial potential to significantly affect the scene's iconography. Did the artists read the text before painting their pictures? Did they need the text to paint their pictures? JWC/MSS: This is the $20,000 question. The Peck Shahnama suggests at least that the manuscript's painter read the verses at the top of the empty space left for illustration, made a determination about the most appropriate poetic moment to depict, and then painted that moment, rather than, say, what by the late sixteenth century was well-established as the iconic haft khan image, that is, Rustam stabbing White Div. MSS: The consistent absence of the verse from the manuscripts examined for this study recounting how White Div charged at Rustam while brandishing a millstone and the frequent presence of a rock or millstone in the cave in proximity to White Div (and sometimes even being carried by him), as in the Peck Shahnama, suggest that artists drew on visual tradition or convention or memory, rather than the text, in creating their compositions. The mace is clearly an extra-textual detail. Likewise, it does not seem to matter whether the text describes Rustam as having cut off White Div's arm and leg or White Div's leg and foot. As long as White Div was incapacitated, by having one leg slashed or cut off, and no longer able to stand upright and thus no longer to pose a serious threat to Rustam, then the painter did not have to be bothered by textual considerations in depicting the other wounded extremity: a hand or arm was as good as a leg, thigh or foot. 51MSS: This is probably the last substantive problem that JWC and I were able to discuss, in a telephone conversation of 22 September 2003. Soon thereafter, I mailed JWC my transcription of these "additional" verses and a list of some forty or so manuscripts in which they occur. Sadly, by the time the packet reached JWC, his condition has worsened and he never was able to tackle this material. The specific verse citations are given above in note 41.</page><page sequence="25">How Rustam Killed White Div 195 Afterword (MSS) This collaborative project came to sad closure in November 2003 at the death of Jerry Clinton. It received a renewed lease on life as a solo venture in September 2004 with the aim of preparing the research undertaken with JWC for publi- cation. Discussions since then with colleagues in many different fields enriched this final phase of the project with stimulating perspectives and brought a whole series of new issues to the fore.52 Not surprisingly perhaps, many of these had less to do with the project's original focus on the interaction of poetry and painting in the Shahnama than with the wider context and meaning of both verbal and visual imagery. I outline some of these issues here to reiterate the conviction with which JWC and I began our interdisciplinary collaboration: that illustrated manuscripts of Firdausi's Shahnama comprise a continual and rich source for understanding Iranian art and culture. *Firdausi signals the equal status of Rustam and White Div as heros in Iran and Mazandaran respectively through the animal imagery and similes he uses to describe them in the haft khan, particularly the repeated characterization of both as lions. In addition, they both experience moments of fear and self- doubt, which they express in their hearts. Notwithstanding this equality, Rustam's eventual removal of White Div's liver clearly indicates the Iranian's martial and moral superiority. *These poetic metaphors are reflected in the protagonists' painted appearance: Rustam is clearly human, but is clothed in an animal-skin robe and helmet, and White Div is clearly animal, or more accurately a fantasy animal, but has certain human attributes, including his biped posture, clothing and jewelry. So while the two characters are very distinctive, they do share common character- istics and seem to have inspired parallel representational modes. *The common representation of White Div and his monstrous troops as human-animal hybrids in the haft khan raises the question of the origins and symbolism of this imagery, as well as the relation to similar demonic creatures in other cultures, such as dev in India. The creatures' heritage doubtless lies in 52I am grateful to the Institute for Advanced Study for a term appointment at the School of Historical Studies (fall 2004), to Priscilla Soucek and Charles Melville for their support of my appli- cation, and to IAS faculty and faculty emeriti Caroline Bynum, Giles Constable, Oleg Grabar, Irving Lavin, and Morton White and fellow members Robert Bjork, Indrani Chatterjee, Devin Stewart, and Julia Thomas for their interest, encouragement and advice.

The depiction of White Div's genitals probably derives from stories about the sexual exploits of demons in Zoroastrian tradition.53 Indeed, the consistent representation of divs with fangs, antlers, jewelry, and so forth very likely corresponds to a prevailing concept of monster in Persian popular culture. *Given that nine out of ten of the haft khan illustrations depict Rustam stabbing White Div, it would be easy for anyone, including the artists who actually painted these compositions, to believe that Rustam stabbed White Div to death. According to Firdausi, however, the creature actually expired when Rustam flung him down on the ground. At least, this is what the penultimate verse on Peck folio 62 verso says. 54 Be that as it may, the way White Div is depicted in the vast majority of the scenes grasping frantically at Rustam and with his eyes wide open-indicate that he may have been dying, but was not yet dead. Thus the iconic image of the haft khan serves as a reminder of several points: text and story can constitute two separate, and often divergent, narratives; illustrations are not just representations of a text but create their own version of a narrative; and death through stabbing may be more graphically convincing and definitive than death by being flung on the ground. *The symbolism of the liver in medieval Persian culture doubtless is relevant for Firdausi's choice of this organ as the one from which blood was to be dropped into the eyes of Kay Kavus and his troops to break their spell of blindness.55 What remains something of a mystery is why the extraction of this critical organ was depicted in the two earliest illustrated copies of the manuscript and only once thereafter. That is to say, the haft khan's climax is a virtually unrepresented moment in the pictorial tradition. Was there some constraint against or fear about representing this climax, or did the stabbing scene effectively imply the subsequent extraction of the liver and the ultimate 53A Clarisse Herrenschmidt and Jean Kellens, "Daiva,"Engylopedia Iranica 6:599a-602b; V.

Francesca Leoni (Ph.D. candidate, Princeton University) is currently pursuing dissert- ation research on divs in the Shahnama. 54This Peck verse does not appear, however, in all Shahnama manuscripts. It is absent, for instance, from the 1217 volume on which the Khaleghi-Motlagh edition primarily depends. 55The use of blood and of animal liver to cure blindness and restore sight is a common trope in ancient oral folktales and doubtless was part of the familiar lore about mythical creatures such as divs that Firdausi drew on in compiling the Shahnama.

Professor Morton White has directed my attention also to the essay "Is Life Worth Living?" in an anthology by Henry James, The Will To Believe (New York, 1912), 32-62 that answers the title's existential question at the outset with: "It depends on the liver." As a life-long scholar of English, as well as Persian, literature, JWC surely would have appreciated this telling riposte.</page><page sequence="27">How Rustam Killed White Div 197 salvation of Kay Kavus and of Iran's monarchy? If so, this may be regarded as a moment-and an image of a moment that epitomized cause and effect and poem and painting reached the same narrative end by different narrative means. *In both its poetic and pictorial/verbal and visual forms, Rustam's fight with White Div may be understood, as already noted, as a allegory of the struggle of good versus evil and the moral imperative of good to vanquish evil. The standard haft khan paintings signal this through various overt signs, including the large, black cave, and some compositions, like the Peck, reflect it by more subtle means, such as Rustam's cleverness in incapacitating White Div by slashing his leg. Inevitably, however, in all these paintings, there is much less that meets the eye than Firdausi's narrative explains or implies.</page></plain_text>
