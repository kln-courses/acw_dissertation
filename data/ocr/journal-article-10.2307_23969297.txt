<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mind of Gladstone: Religion, Homer, and Politics. By David Bebbington. Pp. χ+ 331. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. ISBN 019 926765 o. £50. IN this wide-ranging and original book, David Bebbington, well known for his writing on Evangelicalism, turns his attention to the two principal influences on Gladstone's political ideas: religion and Homer. Aiming to study the great statesman 'from the inside out' (p. 7), the author succeeds in showing how religious and intellectual ideas provided the chief motivation throughout his complex and ever-changing political life. Although there have been earlier studies of Gladstone's formidable mind, this is by far the most comprehensive and thoroughgoing: making use of much unpublished material, as well as Gladstone's many household sermons, Bebbington charts Gladstone's development chronologically from his early</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 275 career as a defender of the ancien régime interested more in the maintenance of the public order than in liberty (ch. ι), to the mature liberal statesman who turns out to be something of a communitarian (ch. 9), a position which can be glimpsed in his early assimilation of the Greek polis as the highest form of community (p. 42). In Gladstone's early years Aristotle was a formative influence, although always in combination with Augustine and St Paul: the natural human tendency towards laws of association acted as a counterbalance to the worst effects of the human inclination towards sin. Through the 1830s, however, Gladstone gradually began to see public opinion as a check on government, something he found increasingly difficult to reconcile with his high doctrine of political obedience (PP· 33_4·)· While maintaining an 'orthodox Anglican political theology' in his early writings, he nevertheless incorporated some degree of open-mindedness into his system. This meant he could respond to the de facto situation of increasing religious pluralism. From its beginning, he was attracted to Tractarianism and to an understanding of the Church of England as a branch of the universal Church, a position which led him to a strong anti-Romanism and nationalism. In his early period Gladstone maintained that it was through the state-sponsoring of religion that the human tendency towards divisiveness and individualism could be overcome. Here Bebbington regards Gladstone as doing in the English context (and in his own less philosophical way) what Hegel had done in Germany (p. 67), and notes the influence of the German political theologian Richard Rothe. However, Bebbington also sees Gladstone as far more tolerant of those outside the Anglican fold than most of the Tractarians, and for this reason regards him more as a representative of orthodox high churchmanship: establishment was about ensuring the nation could function as a community, something he regarded as 'the very essence of the Church of Christ' (p. 76). Discussing Gladstone's assimilation of Tractarianism in detail in chapter 4, Bebbington points to his moral earnestness and asceticism which marked him out in the 1840s as an enthusiastic Puseyite. He was enamoured of ritualism and a supporter of the revival of medieval musical and artistic taste, which included a high regard for Dante (one of his 'doctors') as the repre sentative of a catholic culture. In these years Gladstone's extraordinary sense of activism comes through: sleep, he held, deadens the soul, and everything in one's waking life was pursued for the glory of God. At the same time, he continued</page><page sequence="3">276 REVIEWS to maintain his high doctrine of community. In his dealings with his servants, for instance, Gladstone proclaimed the highest sense of the laws of Christian brotherhood, and he was attracted to Manning's exposition of a similar doctrine in The Unity of the Church. In these Tractarian years Gladstone moved on from his narrow Evangelical understanding of the atonement towards a much more holistic understanding of doctrine which saw the cross as the basis of holy living and which placed far greater stress on the incarnation. The Caroline Divines were important influences behind this development, which paved the way for a more optimistic—and Homeric—understanding of the capacities of human beings. This more tolerant attitude allowed him to sympathize with broad churchmen (including F. D. Maurice and Frederick Temple) and to advocate further reforms which allowed for a more independent Church of England, a position based on his Tractarian understanding of the Church as radically distinct. At the same time he supported more rights for dissenters, although he had little sympathy for those among his friends who converted to Rome. In particular, he was deeply shocked by the departure of Manning from the Anglican fold. Against such a clamour for certainty Gladstone was happy with the world of probabilities maintained by another of his heroes, 'the fountain of all my conceptions' (p. 118), Bishop Butler, whom he continued to read throughout his life and who became the subject of his final writings. This ability to live with probability allowed him to temper authority with liberty. Bebbington charts Gladstone's huge capacity for reading in several European languages, particularly the more liberal-minded authors from France and Germany, including Dôllinger, who became a regular correspondent. What comes out is that religion was to be the great educator of nations as people learnt the virtues of living together in community. Gladstone's desire for the re-union of Christendom was rooted in this understanding. Alongside the God of Christianity, Gladstone also had a high regard for the gods of Mt. Olympus, in whom he discovered something about the capacities of human beings for moral development (although always tempered by sin). Bebbington sees this as rooted in Gladstone's understanding of the incarna tion, which was an increasingly important strand in his Christianity. In Homer, Gladstone found something of his own beliefs—a blend of respect and discipline with the expansion of freedom (p. 153). This, he felt, was grounded in a primeval religion common to all humanity, rather than simply in the</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 277 religion of the Jews and Christians. Religion was not to be located simply in the special revelation of the Church, and neither was it simply a growth of human consciousness, but was instead something universally apprehended in the very constitution of humankind. It had consequently been there from the very beginnings of history. Countering the idea of progress, Gladstone felt that human beings needed to rely on the values given them by God in these earliest times (p. 174). In later years, according to Bebbington, Gladstone changed his mind significantly about Homer, and began to present a far more positive estimate of the Greek understanding of humanity which could temper the undue asceticism of Christianity (p. 187). He began to accept the power of anthropomorphism whereby the divine life was cast into human forms: humans were thus not simply constituted by sin, but were instead 'a model of beauty, strength, and wisdom' (p. 213). Indeed there was a dignity in human beings which was most clearly understood in the Greek tradition, 'the secular counterpart to the Gospel' (p. 214). On this basis, Bebbington writes, 'the rhetoric of humanity studded Gladstone's later speeches... The humanity that transfigured Olympus and the humanity he demanded of British policy were one and the same, a core value of Gladstonian liberalism' (P· 215). Returning to Gladstone's understanding of Christianity, Bebbington discusses his position within the battles of belief, and his preoccupation with apologetics and the rationality of Christianity. He was concerned to show the benefits of the Church for humanity as through its history it had served to restrain violence and to enforce mutual love. In his Vatican Decrees he continued to attack the Roman Catholic Church, primarily because its acceptance of infallibility amounted to a denial of reason, and he became increasingly associated with the national catholic movements that developed in reaction. In later years he devoted his energies to biblical criticism and was attracted to Gore's moderate liberal Catholicism expounded in Lux Mundi (p. 252). He befriended a number of the col lection's contributors, and ensured preferment for Francis Paget to the Oxford Regius Chair. Indeed, Bebbington suggests that Gladstone's faith prefigured the dominant liberal Anglican Catholicism of the twentieth century, and was grounded in the human belief in interdependence and in an understanding of the unity of truth established on the incarnation.</page><page sequence="5">278 REVIEWS In his final chapter, Bebbington reveals the close interconnec tion between Gladstone's religious and political ideas. Through his political life Gladstone remained a conservative liberal: as a liberal he upheld the dignity of the human being and resisted encroachments on liberty, while as a conservative he emphasized the importance of the laws of human association and respect for tradition. Such 'ordered freedom' (p. 264) was established on the Church and on the political community, but also on a deep sense of the humanity of all people including the working man. Internationally, this required methods by which the different nations could co-exist in some form of brotherhood. It is striking to note that in an imperialistic age, Gladstone could write that 'mutual love is not limited by the shores of this island, is not limited by the boundaries of Christian civilization' (p. 294). Justice and love should prevail among all human beings wherever and whoever they were: in this sense he could be regarded as a communitarian reacting against Enlightenment atomism with compassion and humanity. This was a theme, Bebbington suggests, that persisted in the New Liberalism of the first years of the twentieth century, but also in the social thought of the liberal Catholicism of Gore and his colleagues. While this may be a little overstated, the picture of Gladstone that emerges in this detailed study is that of the heroic figure unafraid of human knowledge and passionate about God and humanity. For Max Weber, Gladstone was the epitome of the charismatic leader, and, as becomes clear in this excellent book, it was religious ideas that motivated his leadership from the very beginnings of his life. Unlike most of his fellow politicians before or since, he was not interested in the pursuit of power. Indeed without Gladstone's religion, Britain might have been a very different—and a far less liberal—place. doi:10.1093/jts/fH064 Mark D. Chapman Ripon College, Cuddesdon, Oxford</page></plain_text>
