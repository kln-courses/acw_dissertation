<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greimas's Narrative Grammar* Paul Ricoeur WHAT IS INTERESTING about Greimas's narrative grammar is the way it constructs, degree by degree, the necessary con- ditions for narrativity, starting from a logical model which is the least complex possible and which, initially, includes no chrono- logical import at all. The question is whether, in the attempt to arrive at the structure of those stories which are in fact produced by oral and written traditions, the author, in the successive additions with which he enriches his initial model, does indeed build upon the specifically narrative characteristics of the initial model or whether his develop- ment includes extrinsic presuppositions. Greimas believes that despite these additions to the initial model, an equivalence is maintained, from beginning to end, between that initial model and the final ma- trix. The validity of this belief must be tested theoretically and prac- tically. Here this will be done at the theoretical level, that is, by fol- lowing the author step by step as he constructs his final model, without including examples which might verify a posteriori the fruit- fulness of the method. The question concerning the equivalence between the initial model and the final matrix can be broken down into several stages, following the order the author himself sets out in "l1ments d'une grammaire narrative." In the model we can identify four stages of narrativization: The first is at the level which the author calls fundamental gram- mar, where he introduces for the first time the notion of "narra- tivization,"' this being something contained within the fundamental grammar. The second is found as we move from the fundamental grammar to the "surface narrative grammar." Here the author introduces the notion of "doing," then those of "wanting to do" and "being able to do." On these he bases the notion of "narrative utterance." We find the third in the course of the development of the surface * This essay first appeared as La grammaire narrative de Greimas, in Actes stmiotiques- Documents, 15 (1980) ; this translation is authorized by Actes simiotiques-Documents.</page><page sequence="2">582 NEW LITERARY HISTORY grammar, where a polemical factor is introduced which shapes the notion of "performance," taken to be an exemplary "narrative unit." The fourth is found in the further development of the surface grammar, where the exchange structure provides the author with a "topological" way of representing narrative phenomena. Here we have a reformulation of all the generative operations of narrativity in terms of transfer from one place to another: the "performance series" thus obtained provide the semiotic foundation of the narrative struc- ture itself. At each stage the question is whether equivalence to the initial model is maintained-that is, whether or not the successive degrees of narrativization are limited to a development of the logical forces of the initial model alone, making them explicit in such a way as to be their manifestation, making the deep structure apparent. This simple presentation of the skeletal outline of the author's ar- gument gives an idea of the rigorous and fine distinctions used to bridge gradually the distance between what the author calls "funda- mental ab quo instances" and "final ad quem instances."2 The intellec- tual process we are going to describe here is, strictly speaking, a pro- cess of mediation whose progressive stages must be understood before its value is judged. We must therefore be very attentive to such highly refined distinctions as: (1) "narrativization" (of the taxonomic model); (2) "narrative utterance"; (3) "narrative unit" or "performance"; (4) "performance series." These will now become the titles of our four levels of description and discussion of this body of theory. I. At the Fundamental Grammar Level: The First Stage of "Narrativization" We have to remember the requirements made of the initial model: it must first be constructed at the so-called "immanent" level, that is, a stage that precedes its "manifestation" by some linguistic substance, or even by a nonlinguistic substance (painting, cinema, and so on); then it must show a discursive character, that is, it must be constructed of units that are much larger than utterance (which is manifested as sentence). These two requirements dictate the semiotic level of analysis. We must say right away that the second requirement introduces the minimal condition of narrativity-namely, that it, of its essence, in- cludes a characteristic of "composition" (to use Aristotle's term) of sentences used in discourse, a characteristic that is not deducible from the phrastic structure (that is, from the predicative relationship, as indeed is the case in the theory of metaphor).3</page><page sequence="3">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 583 Thus the initial model must from the outset present an articulated character, if indeed it is going to be able to be narrativized. The stroke of genius-and this is not too strong-is to have sought this already articulated nature in a logical structure that is as simple as possible, that is, in the "elementary structure of signification." This structure has to do with the conditions of grasping of meaning, any meaning. If something-anything at all-signifies, it is not because one might have some intuition as to what it signifies, but because one can lay out in the following way an absolutely elementary system of relations: a relation of contradiction-white/nonwhite; a relation between contraries- white/black; and one of implication or presupposition-nonwhite/ black. Here we have the famous semiotic square, whose logical force is supposed to bring about all subsequent enrichment of the model. To understand primary narrativization, that is, narrativization which occurs at this so-called deep level, we must understand the manner in which semantics and syntax are linked at this very level. The consti- tutive model is semantic in that what it structures is a signification. More precisely, "this elementary structure of signification gives us a semiotic model which allows us to explain the articulation of meaning within a semantic microuniverse" (161). By semantic microuniverse let us agree that we refer to the capacity of a simple element of signification-the "seme"-to be part of the triple relation that we have just mentioned.4 This elementary structure, the author tells us, "is capable of enabling meaning to signify" (162). In other words, it makes a microuniverse of the unit of meaning, that is, a relational microsystem. What constitutes it is also what organizes it. It is also what, subsequently, will allow for the "manipulation" of meaning. It is what shapes all of the transformations we are now going to present.5 How does this constitutive model enter into narrativization? Semantically speaking-or, to say the same thing differently, from the point of view of morphology-the model is rigorously achronic. It is a taxonomy, that is, a system of unoriented relations. The mutual defining of its four poles presents an absolutely static network of relations. But one can represent the model dynamically. One just has to move from the morphological point of view to the syntactic one, that is, treat the constituent relations of the taxonomic model as being operations. Indeed, syntax is no more than a regulating of these oper- ations. Treating relations as operations amounts to viewing significa- tion "as a grasping or a production of meaning by the subject" (164). This must be emphasized: semantics is taxonomic, syntax has to do with operations. The operations taking place are transformations. By so saying, we prepare the way for the introduction of the key notion</page><page sequence="4">584 NEW LITERARY HISTORY which will underlie all subsequent developments of the model, that is, the notion of a "syntactic doing." But, as we shall see, there is more in "doing" than there is in "operation." Nevertheless the idea of a subject who is a producer of meaning already underlines the "dynamization" of the constitutive model which shapes that meaning. Reformulated in terms of operations, our three relations of contradictions, contrar- ies, and presuppositions can appear as transformations by which a given content is negated and others affirmed. We will call the transformation by negation "disjunction," and the transformation by affirmation "conjunction." If we view these transformations as oriented operations we end up with the primary condition of narrativity. This is nothing more than the setting into motion of the taxonomic model.6 Discussion Before moving from the deep grammar to the surface narrative grammar, let us pause to make a critical comment. Three questions are raised. The first has to do with the principle itself by which a distinction is made between a deep grammar and a surface narrative grammar. The second has to do with the logical rigor of the consti- tutive model. The third deals with the "narrativization" of that model. 1. As for the general relation between fundamental (or deep) grammar and surface grammar, one might ask if in fact this is a relation of the "immanent" (that is, as premanifestation) to the "manifest." The complete answer to this question cannot be given at this stage of the discussion inasmuch as it amounts to asking whether or not the surface grammar is richer than the deep grammar in terms of relations and operations. But given the extent to which the distinc- tion between immanent structure and manifestation brings into play the general relations between the semiotic and the linguistic, one might wonder whether the hierarchy of these two levels does not a priori bring into play relations of another order, already noted by Saussure: that is, that the linguistic order is at the same time one semiotic system among other semiotic systems and the paradigm within which one can discover the general characteristics of semiotics in general. Proof for this is found in the analysis of Greimas's constitutive model which shows itself to be, of its essence, "semic" (the binary schema sl/non-sl). I do not contest, the rightness of reaching the semiotic through the linguistic. I do contest the correctness of a procedure that articulates the semiotic before it articulates the linguistic. This way the semiotic and the linguistic reciprocally precede each other: the first by virtue of its general nature, the second by virtue of its exemplary status.</page><page sequence="5">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 585 This objection is not inconsequential as far as narrativity is con- cerned. If, in fact, the semiotic and the linguistic precede each other according to different points of view, it is possible that sometimes a semiotic analysis, operating in the context of a preliminary narrative intelligibility, might legitimately construct a priori the semiotic square (or squares) which structure that text. In this case, semiotic analysis has a real heuristic value and really can show how the text should be read. But it can happen that a semiotic analysis might also be feigned. What I mean is that the analysis, shaped by a narrative force which establishes its own criteria, might be not so much constructed a priori, but reconstructed instead after the fact, in order to meet the demands of the semiotic approach. Finally-and this is, in my opinion, the most frequent case, if indeed not the norm-the constitutive model for the semiotic level and the specific criteria for narrativity which the fol- lowing discussion will identify, can come together in a mixed or com- plex conceptual understanding of narrativity which is an accurate reflection of the complex relationship according to which the semiotic and the linguistic mutually precede each other from different points of view. 2. As for the logical rigor of the constitutive model, the constraints that it imposes upon semiotic analysis, and even more understandably upon subsequent linguistic analysis, are perhaps those that one would expect from a model that is too rigid for what must subsequently be codified by it, and, as often happens when one interprets in a given area according to models constructed a priori, certain of the model's requirements might have to be attenuated in order to function well in subsequent applications. We note immediately that all is based upon semic analysis,' and that while indeed this analysis identifies certain discursive characteristics, in the sense of articulations, which lend themselves to being narra- tivized, they are not established at the transphrastic level as had been promised. The analysis does not begin at a point beyond utterance, but within it, at the level of a fundamental semantics. In this sense, the model is not discursive in the sense of discourse being a wider unit than utterance. We have therefore to presuppose the existence of a homological arrangement of the infra- and supraphrastic structures which is not thematically developed here.8 It will also be noted that the semic analysis has to be completed first, or at least to have reached the stage at which it allows for a "limited inventory of the semic categories" (161), as in the example of white versus black. This requirement is rarely met. But above all, it will be noted that the taxonomic model has a strictly logical significance only if it remains a very powerful model. Let us be</page><page sequence="6">586 NEW LITERARY HISTORY clear: the three relations of contradictions, contraries, and presuppo- sitions are what they are only if contradiction signifies no more than the relation between s, and non-s1; if the relation of contraries be- tween s, and S2 truly constitutes a binary semic category of the white versus black type, that is, within the precise framework of a polar opposition between semes of the same category; and finally if the presupposition of non-s1 by S2 is truly preceded by two relations of contradictions and contraries which obey the rigorous conditions just mentioned. Now, one can justifiably doubt that all three conditions will be met rigorously in the area of narrativity. If they were, all subsequent operations would have to be "predictable and calculable" (166). But then nothing would happen. There would be no events. There would be no surprise. There would be nothing to tell. One can suppose that the surface grammar will more often be dealing in quasi contradictions, quasi contraries, quasi presuppositions. As we shall see, many of the author's "schemata" (so he calls the twosome con- structed from the relation of contradiction) are only analogous to contradictions. Many of the "correlations" between two such "schemata" are weak contraries (that is, they could not sustain a true semic analysis and cannot be authenticated by pointing to their resting on a binary semic category of the white versus black type). Finally- and above all-the crucial point for the proper functioning of the constitutive model has to do with the kind of constraints-introduced by the relation of presupposition, which links non-sa to s2-which regulate the deixes. These constraints are entirely dependent upon the force of the other two relations between contradictions and contrar- ies. Therefore, only in a case where these three requirements have not been weakened can we speak of the "unity of meaning" of the four- term model and of the isotopy of the semantic microuniverse articu- lated by the constitutive model. In a case in which the relations are too attenuated, too much just a fact of analogy, if not simply counterfeit- ing, the relation of presupposition no longer holds. The unity of meaning is broken up and the isotopy vacillates. It is perhaps at this point that some novelty is included in the operations made upon, and the manipulations of, the constitutive model. 3. What of the "narrativization" of the taxonomic model? It is sup- posed to be guaranteed by the fact of one's moving from the idea of relation to that of operation. This is assuredly the key point and is within the deep grammar itself. At first sight-and if one reads the "1llments d'une grammaire narrative" in the light of "Les jeux des contraintes semiotiques"- primacy is given to morphology in a reading which is avowedly par- adigmatic. The emphasis is thus not on the difference between rela-</page><page sequence="7">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 587 tions and transformations, but on the fact that the constitutive model is, of its essence, of a discursive nature--or at least an articulated one. Since each case of signification constitutes a relational microuniverse, reformulation in terms of operations appears to be no more than a corollary of this signification network arrangement. The equivalence between relations and operations remains unthreatened, but one can- not understand how an achronic model can contain the conditions for narrativity. Is it enough to take relations as operations? Is it enough for these operations to be oriented9 and form series? Do these things allow us to speak of narrativization? Even more, the whole enterprise can be suspected of having, from the outset, misunderstood the narrative dimension of discourse. For a reading that takes more closely into account the shift in em- phasis seen between the "Contraintes" and the "'lements" (to which the author himself attests),10 moving from the idea of relation to that of operation implies the need for wholesale additions to the taxo- nomic model which really change its nature and also give it an au- thentic chronological nature. These additions are evident in the "l1ments" in the notion of "production of meaning by the subject" (164). What subject? If it is not yet the actant of surface grammar, it is already the subject of a doing, of a syntactic doing which will pre- cisely bring about the transition to a general doing, a central point for all of the anthropomorphic meanings of the story. We thus have here much more than reformulation. Instead it is the introduction, on an equal footing, of a syntagmatic factor alongside the paradigmatic fac- tor. This is in fact a process involving "already established terms" (164), or "terms with already invested values" (164). In a case where you have a relation of contradiction, you effectuate the negation of one of the terms. You change it into its contradictory, which you then affirm. It is this transformation of invested content into other content that constitutes narrativization. There is thus a syntactic initiative ap- plied to the simple taxonomic model. But if that is so then the notion of equivalence loses its meaning in terms of reciprocal relations, when we move from morphology to syntax." It even loses its strict meaning in terms of isotopic, although not isomorphic, relations: In what way are a stable relation and its transformation equivalent, if orientation is what is important?12 To go even further, one might ask whether the construction of the taxonomic model was not guided by the idea of the transformations to be made to its terms. This question, as we shall see, can and will be asked at all levels: the final point of an operation should be the next operation, ending with the narrative's completed project. And if the taxonomic model was constructed in view of the syntactic operations to be grafted onto it, is it not true that these</page><page sequence="8">588 NEW LITERARY HISTORY operations in turn become conditions for narrativity only retro- spectively? This follows from their use in the narrative surface grammar-where they are linked with characteristics which appear and occur only in terms of phenomena unique to the surface grammar. For my part, I am inclined to think that the enterprise, from be- ginning to end, obeys a twofold postulate: on the one hand, in an unfolding process, it applies, to all levels of narrativization, the logical force of the initial taxonomic model in such a way as to elevate semi- otics to the rank of a deductive science; on the other hand, the en- terprise, in a reverse process, seeks to construct the stages of the conditions for narrativity in the light of the end point of a given narrative. To satisfy the first requirement, all additions to the model must appear to be equivalent transformations between isotopic metalanguages (167). To meet the second demand, new specifications must be introduced at each stage in order to enhance the initial model, given its ultimate application in terms of the end point of the narrative. Movement from one level to the other thus loses all its deductive nature. The complex interplay of these two requirements gives the whole enterprise the ambiguous appearance of reducing narrative to logic or of seeing narrative as a surpassing of logic. This ambiguous nature is obvious even at the initial stage, where narra- tivization appears to be the object of a reluctant recognition, half denied, scarcely avowed. II. From the Fundamental Grammar to the Surface Narrative Grammar: The Narrative Utterance The decisive grammatical shift is that which takes us from the "deep" or fundamental level to the level which Greimas calls "surface," even though it is still, in his view, an intermediate plane between the strictly conceptual one we have been looking at, and the strictly "figurative" one, the one at which actors accomplish tasks, undergo tests, reach goals. Although the differences between deep and surface structures may be easy to characterize, the difference between the superficial and figurative levels is difficult to describe. The level that we are now going to concentrate upon is, like the preceding one, a metalanguage level vis-a-vis the figurative language. The discussion of "figurative" will come later. The distinctive feature of this level is the anthropomorphic represen- tation of the operations described earlier. If one says "anthropo- morphic" one means interpreting the notion of operation in terms of</page><page sequence="9">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 589 "doing." In other words, "doing is an operation that is made specific by the addition of a human classeme" (167). The syntactic operations of affirming and negating by conjunction and disjunction are thus rewritten as a syntactic doing. To this doing, which is syntactic because the reformulated operations were themselves syntactic, Greimas adds all the doing of human activity, to the extent that, in semiotics, all doing, whether performing an action ("Peter goes out") or recounting a doing ("Peter tells"), comes into play only when transcoded into a message. That is, it becomes an object of communication circulating between a sender and receiver. So it is that the notion of a syntactic doing, equivalent to that of an operation (itself being equivalent to a relation), provides the mediation required to generate the kind of utterance needed in order for the author legitimately to characterize a surface grammar as being a narrative grammar. This utterance is the narrative utterance. It expresses a process which articulates a func- tion, in Propp's sense, and an actant. This can be represented as NU = F(A). "One can thus say that any operation upon the deep gram- mar can be converted into a narrative utterance whose minimal canonic form is F(A)" (168). As can be seen, the equivalences upon which the entire enterprise rests are the homogeneity between syntactic operation and syntactic doing on the one hand, and on the other, between syntactic doing and any utterance expressing the doing of an actant. Once this "isotopy without isomorphism" has been allowed (167), the theory of the narrative utterance develops in a remarkable way. In a thoroughly felicitous way the author has the narrative utterances spawn utterances which describe an effective doing and others which describe a wanting to do. If you consider that the complete utterance of the wanting to do is of the following form: X wants Y to do, then you can see that this wanting to do, formulated within the left-hand side of the complete utterance, modalizes the narrative utterance which, in turn, becomes the object of the wanting. It modalizes it in the sense that it makes it possible, thus causing it to go through the succession of the possible, the real, and the necessary modalities. Thus we will call modal utterances-so that we can distinguish them from simple narrative utterances, which we will from now on refer to as descriptive utterances-those utterances of the wanting to do form and those showing the same form which will be presented later. The introduction of wanting in fact constitutes the first in a series of "pre- determined semantic restrictions" (168) which identify actants as sub- jects, that is, as potential operators of doing. The narrative utterance is itself specified as being a program which a subject wishes to carry out. In a general way, we call the complete modal utterance of the</page><page sequence="10">590 NEW LITERARY HISTORY following type a program: (1) "X wants Y to do... ." Greimas next constructs a series of model utterances of the same form. First: (2) "X wants X to do... ." In this case, the same actor both wants and does. Then: (3) "X wants to have .. ."; (4) "X wants to be... ." In these cases the object of the wanting is an attribution of objects or values. We will speak of attributive utterances (which will play a key role in the last phase in the construction of the completed model) when dealing with utterances of types (3) and (4). We still have left those modal utterances of the form: (5) "X wants to know (how to do ...)"; (6) "X wants to be able (to do .. .)." Here, the modal utterance is doubled to become a wanting to know how and a wanting to be able. At the end of this remarkable reconstruction of the typology of de- scriptive and modal utterances, the author believes that he has kept the equivalence between the elementary units of the surface grammar and those of the deep grammar (172). Discussion Discussion of the second segment of the semiotic reconstruction of narrativity will follow the same order as the discussion of the first segment. 1. The general question concerning the relation between deep and surface grammar can now be taken up in more detail. Does the logical level purely and simply precede the anthropomorphic level? This is certainly true in terms of the order of the exposition, since it is nec- essary to introduce determining factors which "specify," which "tran- scribe in a more complex way" the operations of the deep grammar. But can the same be said concerning the order of discovery on the part of a reader? It is the anthropomorphic level which, in my opin- ion, carries all of the significations of doing. All these cases of signi- fication are born of what I would call the semantics of action. We al- ready know, concerning a knowing that is immanent to doing itself, that doing is the object of utterances whose structure differs in es- sence from that of predicative utterances of the type "s is p," as it does also from the relational utterances of the type "X is between Y and Z." This structure of the descriptive utterance of action has been the object of precise study in analytic philosophy and I give an account of this in "La semantique de l'action" (in which I refer particularly to Anthony Kenny).'3 One remarkable characteristic of these utterances is that their structure allows for everything from "Socrates speaks.. ." to "Brutus killed Caesar on the Ides of March in the Roman Senate with a dagger...."</page><page sequence="11">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 591 It is this semantics of action which in fact is presupposed in the narrative utterance. Here, doing is substitutable for all verbs of action (as with the English to do) and is equated with them in the canonic form NU = F(A). I therefore now make the above suggestion more precise. It will be remembered that it dealt with the relation between semiotics and linguistics and saw them in terms of a mutual precedence. The semi- otic square gives us its network of interdefined terms and its system of contradictions, contraries, and presuppositions. Semantics of action offer us the principal significations of doing and the specific structure for utterances which refer to action. In this sense, surface grammar is a mixed grammar: semiotic-praxic. Nowhere is the specificity of the semantics of action more evident than in the movement from utterances on doing to utterances on being able to do. What makes it certain that wanting to do brings about doing? Nothing in the semiotic square allows us to believe this. Furthermore, the typology of wanting to do, of wanting to be, of wanting to have, of wanting to know, and of being able to want, is excellent. But, from the point of view of linguistics, it is implicated in a very specific grammar which analytic philosophy has developed with great sophistication under the name of intensional logic. But if a special grammar is required to put into logical form the relations between modal utterances of the "wanting that .. ." type and descrip- tive utterances of doing, it is the phenomenology implicit in the se- mantics of action which gives meaning to Greimas's declaration that "modal utterances which have wanting as their function set the subject up as a virtuality of doing, whereas the other two modal utterances, characterized by the knowing how to and being able to modalities, determine this potential doing in two different ways: as a doing re- sulting from knowing how to or as one founded exclusively on being able to" (175). This implicit phenomenology is brought to light when "one can interpret the modal utterances as 'the desire to realize' a program which is present in the form of a descriptive utterance and is at the same time part of, as an object, the modal utterance" (169). One might say, in terms of "desire," that we have already moved from the anthropomorphic level to the figurative one (hence the quotation marks around "desire to realize"). But can these two levels be distin- guished from each other within modal utterances?14 Can an utterance with two actants which links a virtual subject with an object which is itself a doing in fact utter anything else but desire? The author con- tradicts himself when he again takes up the term desire (without quo- tation marks this time) in order to account for the structure of modal utterances: "the axis of desire which links [the two actants: the subject</page><page sequence="12">592 NEW LITERARY HISTORY and the object] legitimizes, in turn, a semantic interpretation of them as a virtual performing subject and an object set up as a value" (171). Likewise, if the figurative level is "that at which human or personified actors accomplish tasks, submit to tests, reach goals" (166), one might wonder if the anthropomorphic level, given that it includes utterances on wanting to do, being able to do, knowing how to do, hence "the desire to realize" a program, can be defined without tasks, tests, and goals. Here again, the meanings proffered by the semantics of action precede the semiotic square even if that square, by its logical simplic- ity, precedes the complexity of the categories of the surface grammar. 2. We can move on to the next point and inquire into the equiva- lence of the two metalanguages-that of the conceptual order and that of the anthropomorphic order. This equivalence, as we have seen above, has as guarantor the notion of syntactic doing, a doing which is homogeneous simultaneously to syntactic operations and to ordi- nary doing transcoded into message. I fear that in this reasoning we have a certain paralogism.'5 Syntactic doing can designate only the operations of conjunction and disjunction which give rise to affirma- tions and negations on the semiotic square. You cannot, without am- biguity, call ordinary doing transcoded into message a syntactic doing. The transcoding operation which transforms doing into an object message within a relation of communication does not prevent the descriptive utterance from precisely describing a doing which is not the equivalent of a syntactic operation, but is rather the formal term that is substituted for all terms of action. This is why the utterance of a doing cannot be equivalent to syntactic doing, which reformulates, in an anthropomorphic language, syntactic operations. On the con- trary, it is because utterances of doing are specific that one is saying something new when one reformulates logical operations as a syntac- tic doing. Even in the expression "syntactic doing," the author is bor- rowing from the semantics of action.16 What can conceal the paralogism is the fact that doing, transcoded into message, develops its own syntax (a predicate with two argu- ments, specific grammar for the verbal tenses, open structure of the utterance, and so on). But the syntax of doing, which praxiology discusses, and that of wanting, of being able to, and of knowing how to do, which intensional logic studies, do not derive from syntactic doing in the strict sense defined above. It is therefore very difficult to find an equivalence between the structures used by the semantics of action and the operations implied by the semiotic square. It is true that the simple narrative utterance is still an abstraction within the surface grammar, to the extent that the polemical relation between contradictory programs has not yet been</page><page sequence="13">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 593 introduced. Only this relation can give rise to series admitting of comparison with the syntactic series of operations following the tax- onomic model. This is why we must postpone the complete discussion concerning the isotopy of the two metalanguages to the third stage in the construction of the complete model. However, to the extent that the author himself hints at this isotopy at the level of syntactic doing, we must oppose this hint, by making reference to the discontinuity, which is introduced by doing and its syntax, between the logical and the anthropomorphic levels. 3. The preceding remark concerning the abstract character of the narrative utterance in relation to the unfolding narrative, of which more later, leads us to a third observation. This concerns the narrative qualifying of the descriptive utterance (X does A) and of the modal utterance (X wants to do A). If we examine doing, and even more, wanting to do and the other modalities, this brings us, decisively, to the order of story. However, I will not call the utterances of these two types narrative. What they lack, in order to be narrative, is the fact of being articulated in a series of utterances of the same kind which together construct a plot, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. I will call such simple utterances action utterances rather than narrative utterances. This is based on Arthur Danto's definition of "narrative phrases.""7 Greimas would probably allow me this reservation, since from the outset he established, as the criteria for the autonomous level of narrative structures, the requirement that the latter contain units of meaning that are longer than a simple utterance. Having reached the end of these two stages, we see the following results: (1) we have set up two conditions for narrativity, but not narrativity itself; (2) these two conditions are irreducible, one to the other: one is of a logical order, and the other of a praxic order; (3) the praxic condition sets a semantics of action into play, and this latter sets up a syntax whose intelligibility is itself not unalloyed: phenomeno- logical and linguistic. III. From the Narrative Utterance to the Narrative Unit: "Performance" By introducing relations of confrontation and resistance, therefore by giving a polemical representation of the whole schema, we give to the relations of the semiotic square their truly anthropomorphic equivalent. But, more precisely-and this will have consequences for our discussion-it is of contradiction that a confrontation between a subject sl and an antisubject s2 gives an anthropomorphic represen-</page><page sequence="14">594 NEW LITERARY HISTORY tation par excellence. Nonetheless, it is the succession of transforma- tions of content, along the axes of contrariety and presupposition, which then gives rise to a chain of narrative utterances which, taken together, constitute the narrative units. According to this new refor- mulation, negation presents itself as domination and affirmation as attribution (attribution of a value-object according to whether the ut- terance is wanting to be or wanting to have). We thus obtain a syntagmatic succession of the type: confrontation (NU1), domination (NU2), attribution (NU3). This succession consti- tutes a unit of a syntactic nature which, it is decided, will be called performance. Since narrative utterances can be of two kinds, according to whether they involve doing or wanting to do (or the other modal- ities of doing), we will have performance not only of doing, but of wanting to do, knowing how to do (manifested as ruse and trickery), and of being able to do (manifested as real or magical power). For the discussion of the equivalence between the two metalan- guages, it is absolutely necessary to emphasize the complex and ar- ticulated character of the phenomenon which, in relation to the per- formance series (see below), appears as a "narrative unit." Again we emphasize that what is here called "narrative unit" is not the same thing as the simple narrative utterance. It is, in fact, a syntactic unit in the sense that it is a unified syntagmatic succession. It is this unit which appropriately can be superimposed upon the interplay of tax- onomic relations and upon the interplay of disjunction and conjunc- tion operations.18 This is why it is from the complex makeup of performance, much more than from the simple narrative utterance, that we should be able to read an equivalence between deep and surface grammar. Greimas sees this equivalence at play between the orientation of the relations of the taxonomic schema and the relation of implication by which NU3 (attribution) implies NU2 (domination) which implies NU1 (confron- tation): "with, nonetheless, this difference, if the orientation follows the order of the utterances NU---NU2--NU3, implication is oriented in the reverse direction" (174). Thanks to the equivalence between orientation and implication we can say that the final narrative utter- ance of a performance-attribution-is "the equivalent, at the surface level, of the logical affirmation of the deep grammar" (175). Discussion 1. This discussion will not dwell on the general relationship be- tween the deep and the surface grammars: since performance derives</page><page sequence="15">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 595 from the narrative utterance, all of the semantics of action, whether at the level of doing or at the level of wanting to do, knowing how to do, and being able to do, is found here. Nonetheless, a complementary argument appears with the polemical representation of logical rela- tions. This representation brings with it several new characteristics which, before taking on a logical significance (which is, however, du- bious, as we shall see) of the contradiction/contrariety type, possess an autonomous praxic significance. Confrontation and resistance are fig- ures for the orientation of action toward others, that is, of a significant phenomenon which Max Weber places at the head of the constitutive categories of his comprehensive sociology.19 Context or resistance (Kampf) is a specifying of the orientation toward others which comes into play later when the semantics of social action are constructed.20 To the extent that performance, for Greimas, complements the idea of program with that of polemic, we have to say that perfor- mance, in which the author sees "the most characteristic unit of nar- rative syntax" (173), is also the most characteristic unit of the mixed character-logical and praxic---of the whole of the narrative order. A more important problem is to evaluate the degree of equivalence that can subsist in this alloy of logic and praxis which we see between the two metalanguages, the logical and the anthropomorphic.21 2. Let us consider the reasoning upon which Greimas bases this equivalence. Three remarks: (a) We are surprised to read that confrontation is the anthropomorphic representation of contradiction (therefore at the level of each of the schemata sl versus non-s1 and s2 versus non-s2) and also that two subjects, sI and s2 (subject and antisubject) corre- spond to two contradictory doings (172). Has the author confused contrariety and contradiction? It is unlikely. Thus several hypotheses suggest themselves: for example, if confrontation does not corre- spond to contradiction, contrariety cannot have anthropomorphic representation. To fill this lack do we have to posit confrontation/ contrariety alongside confrontation/contradiction? This seems to be the case, to the extent that it is the correlation between two schemata, therefore contrariety, which allows for completion of the trajectory through four poles, sl, non-s1, s2, non-s2, of the semiotic square. But this attenuating of the logical model allows only for establishing the equivalence of confrontation with both contrariety and contradiction. And indeed this still requires that very weak forms of contrariety be postulated which are far removed from the white/black type. Indeed this is so and we are given a "limited inventory of semic categories" (161). We can thus expect that the equivalence will be proportionately attenuated.</page><page sequence="16">596 NEW LITERARY HISTORY (b) This attenuation is particularly necessary when the author tries to establish a correspondence between the function of attribution (NU3) and instances of affirmation. Let us come back to the semiotic square: the final affirmation is the one which posits s2 through pre- supposition from non-sI. But have we not already said that presup- position cannot take place unless the accompanying contrariety is a strong contrariety? And have we not just seen that contrariety here remained without a determinate polemic? (c) What is even more serious is that the chain of the narrative utterances NUI, NU2, NU3, which are constitutive of performance, does not constitute a chain of implication unless, as the author him- self admits, you reverse the order of the utterances and thereby move from attribution to domination and confrontation. Now, orientation was necessary for the narrativization of the taxonomic model. Does this not amount to an admission that the correspondence between the relations that are internal to performance and those that are internal to the taxonomic model does not apply to the very condition for narrativity as engendered by the model? Here, the equivalence is no longer just weak. It is forced. Indeed, the notion of polemic, so felicitously introduced by Grei- mas at the root of narrativity, brings into play a type of negativity which Kant was the first to show, in his Versuch, den Begriff der nega- tiven Gr6ssen in die Wetweisheit einzufiihren, to be irreducible to contra- diction. Opposing a subject to an antisubject does not set up an op- position between two contradictory doings. It is legitimate to fear that it is not at all like contrariety either. If I now bring together the last series of remarks concerning (1) the mixed logical and praxic model and (2) the weakness of the equiva- lence between the two metalanguages, we can expect two kinds of results from the correspondence between the logical properties of the semiotic square and the praxic categories which are the most deter- mined by the polemical nature of action. To the extent that the logical model, even when weakened, retains a certain priority in the reading of a narrative text, the semiotic square exercises a heuristic function which I happily admit. However, to the extent that the praxic rela- tions of a strictly polemical nature escape logical contradiction repre- sentation-even logical contrariety representation-the semiotic square runs the risk of being reduced to a presentational artifice by which the semiotician conforms his readings, after the fact, to his models. 3. As to the strictly narrative tenor of the syntagmatic succession which articulates performance, I would say that it is superior to that of the simple narrative utterance, by virtue of the introduction of the</page><page sequence="17">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 597 polemic factor. However, performance still does not go beyond the stage of the conditions for narrativity. The author admits this: it is only with the performance series, which we will speak of shortly, that he is able to constitute the complete set of conditions for story. This is why he, quite properly, designates performance by the term narrative unit. Will we nevertheless say that the syntagmatic succession of confrontation, domination, attribution constitutes of itself a mi- crostory? We can without doubt say so, but only if we emphasize that this oriented succession presents relations which are inverse to the relation of implication which alone can legitimize the statement that NU3 "is the equivalent, at the surface level, of logical affirmation at the deep grammar level" (175). Now it is precisely in this inverse relation of implication that something new happens, of which a story can be born. IV. The Last Stage: The Performance Series Greimas's final stroke of inspiration is to complete the constitution of his narrative model by adding the polemical category, the anthro- pomorphic doublet of the relation of contradiction, the category of transfer borrowed from the communication schema or more generally from the structure of exchange. Here is how this new structure is applied to the previous system. We pointed out that the last of the three narrative utterances which constituted performance could be expressed as an attributive utterance, according to which a subject acquires an object or a value. To reformulate attribution in terms of exchange, one could say that a subject acquires what another subject is deprived of. Attribution can thus be broken down into two opera- tions: deprivation, which is equivalent to disjunction, and an attribu- tion proper, which is equivalent to a conjunction. This reformulation-the last one proposed by the author-leads to the notion of the performance series, an abbreviated form for the "syntagmatic series of performances." Such a series can be seen as the formal framework of every narrative. It is only at this stage that the narrative grammar is complete (or, as we shall see, almost complete). The general advantage of this reformulation is that it permits one to represent all the previous operations as changes of "place"-the initial and final places of transfers. In other words, it corresponds to a topological syntax of translative utterances. In turn, the richness of this topological syntax can be observed as the topological analysis is carried out at the two levels of doing and wanting to do. If one first of all considers only value-objects, acquired or trans-</page><page sequence="18">598 NEW LITERARY HISTORY ferred by doing, then the topological syntax enables us to represent the ordered series of operations on the semiotic square along the lines of contradiction, contrariety, and presupposition as a circular trans- mission of values. One can say without hesitation that this topological syntax of transfers is the true motivation of narration as the creative process of values (178). If one now considers no longer only the operations, but the operators,22 that is to say, in the exchange schema, the senders/ receivers of the transfer, then the topological syntax regulates the transfer of the capacity to do, and therefore operates the transfers of the values considered above. In other words, it regulates the institution proper of the syntactic operators by creating subjects endowed with the virtuality of doing. Separating the topological syntax therefore corresponds to sepa- rating doing and wanting (being able to do, knowing to do)- corresponds, that is, to dividing narrative utterances into descriptive and modal utterances, or dividing them into two series of perfor- mances: acquisition then corresponds to transfer, bearing either on object-values or on modal values (acquiring the being able, the know- ing, the wanting to do). The second series of performances is the most important one from the point of view of the activation of the syntactic trajectory. The operators must be instituted as being able, knowing, and wanting, in order in turn for transfers of value-objects to take place. If one wishes to know where the first actant comes from, it is necessary to evoke the contract which institutes the subject of desire by attributing to him the modality of wanting. The specific narrative unity in which the want- ing of the "knowing" or "able" subject is posited constitutes the first performance of the narrative. The "completed narrative" (180) combines the series of transfers of value-objects with the series of transfers instituting the "knowing" or "able" subject. Discussion 1. The last stage of the completed constituent model enables us to raise for the last time the general question of the mixed nature- logical and praxic--of this model. The new addition to be considered is the transfer by which a subject is deprived of what is attributed to another. Now anyone can see that to deprive and to give signify more than to disjoin and to conjoin. Lack and deprivation are categories the anthropomorphic nature of which becomes manifest only if one con-</page><page sequence="19">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 599 siders, as was so well shown by Claude Bremond in Logique du recit, the relationship between being subjected to and acting: "We define as play- ing the role of patient every person which the narrative presents as being affected in one way or another by the course of the events narrated."2, The notion of a patient affected by a certain state logi- cally precedes that of any modification (or conservation) of state. The deprivation of a value-object, suffered by a subject, and the attribu- tion of this same object to another subject are modifications affecting a patient. What the last stage of the constitution of the model there- fore adds is a phenomenology of suffering-acting, in which notions such as deprivation and donation take on meaning. As far as I am concerned, it is this implicit phenomenology which permits Greimas to write: "actants are conceived no longer as operators, but as places where value-objects can be situated, places where they can be brought or from where they can be taken" (176). The topological language of this last phase is thus a mixture of logical conjunction/disjunction and modifications which happen not only in the practical field, but also in the pathetic one. The operative value cannot therefore come exclu- sively from the logical aspects of attribution, but also, in turn, from the topological syntax and the semantics of acting and suffering ac- cording to whether the topological syntax plays an effectively heuris- tic role in the reading of the text, or whether it is an artifice of exposition in relationship to interplay of the pathico-praxic categories.24 2. This composite nature of the topological syntax results in a new weakening of the equivalence between logical metalanguage and an- thropomorphic metalanguage. In fact, just as the author attempted to link the polemical values of narrativity solely to the relation of con- tradiction of the taxonomic model, now the circular transmission of values, in the topological syntax of the transfers, rests on the correlation25 between the two schemata (d, versus non-d1, d2 versus non-d2): d, d2 d2 d, This opposition is what creates spatial heterotopy. Consequently, it is the relation of presupposition (non-d2---dI and non-dl---d2) which</page><page sequence="20">600 NEW LITERARY HISTORY bears the entire logical weight of the topological apparatus. Two sche- mata, two programs can in fact be correlated in various ways. The logical projection of this correlation can be called contrariety only if the terms are in the same relation as black and white, which is rarely borne out in the praxic and pathetic order. All sorts of modifications can affect a state, without the correlation of roles being reduced to their contrariety. Now if the correlation is reduced to a weak contra- riety, indeed analogical, then presupposition in turn loses its charac- teristic of logical constraint. That is not to say that correlation and presupposition become relations empty of all meaning. Greimas char- acterizes, and justly so, the places occupied or attained by the corre- lated programs as "heterotopic spaces whose deixes are disjoined, because they do not belong to the same schemata, but conformal, since they are linked by the relation of presupposition" (177). When correlation moves away from strong contrariety, conformity moves away from strong presupposition (or implication). Must one not now say that the hypotactic axes (non-d2--d and non-d1---d2), the functioning of which from the beginning seems to have constituted the critical point of this entire logical system, have only a narrative content, insofar as, lacking categorical unity (as in the case of the polar terms black/white), it is the unity of plot which ensures the "conformity of the heterotopic spaces"? To what do they conform? They conform to what Aristotle calls the dianoia, correlative to the mythos of narrative. In this vein, Northrop Frye remarks that the typology of mythos is systematically coupled with a typology of dianoia. It is the history of culture which engenders the schematization of this dianoia and these mythoi, which are the matrix of the weak logical operations and relations. This conclusion should not be surprising if it is true that the topo- logical syntax of the transfers, which functions in conjunction with the trajectory of the logical operations of the semiotic square, "organizes narration as a process creating values" (178). How can this redupli- cation account for the passage from the syntactic operations, which in the taxonomic framework were "predictable and calculable" (166), to "process creating values"? Of necessity, logicity must somehow be inadequate in relationship to creativity, which characterizes narrative. This gap becomes obvious at the level of transfer, insofar as correla- tion and presupposition move away from the strong logical model and express the dissymmetry of deprivation and attribution and the new- ness proper to attribution. The nature of newness linked to attribution is more evident when being able to, knowing how to, and wanting to do-that is to say, the actual virtuality of the doing-is granted the subject. The word "institution"-in the expression "institution of the syntactic operators"-is not too strong to express the newness in "the</page><page sequence="21">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 601 contract instituting the subject of desire through the attribution of the modality of wanting .. ." (179). This gap between the initial schema, where all the relations com- pensate for one another, and the final schema, where new values are produced, is masked by the particular case of Propp's Russian folk- tales, where the circulation of values ends up restoring the initial state. The king's daughter, carried off by the villain who transfers her elsewhere to hide her, is found by the hero and brought back to her parents! In Structural Semantics, Greimas himself admits that the most general function of narrative is to reestablish an order of threatened values. Now we know, thanks to the schematization of plots produced by the cultures we have inherited, that this restoration characterizes only one category of narratives, and even probably of folktales. Di- verse are the ways in which plot articulates "crises" and "conclusion"! And diverse are the ways in which the hero (or antihero) is modified in the course of the intrigue! Is it even certain that every narrative can be projected onto this teleological matrix, having two programs, a polemical relation and a transfer of values? Although this method- ological a priori can help the reader respect the text and discover its hidden articulations, it also risks becoming the Procrustean bed on which the text is racked. 3. There remains the question of confidence: are the conditions of narrativity complete, once the syntactic operators are instituted and the topological syntax of the modal values added to those of the objective values? That the terminal model constitutes the most rigorous ap- proximation of the narrative structure permitted by the method is undeniable. But how far is this approximation from what constitutes narrative proper, that is to say, from plot? With exemplary lucidity, the author himself suggests at the end of his essay that he has sketched out the main point of "only part" of the superficial narrative syntax, that is to say, the part "dealing with the body proper of narrative." "What is missing in this sketch," he says, "is the examination and the establishment of the syntactic units which frame narrative, and which correspond to the initial and final se- quences of the manifest narrative" (181). Now, are these sequences not as essential to plot as opening and closing? It is true that the superficial grammar has the potential to describe its own inadequa- cies. We already alluded to the contract by which the first actant is instituted into a subject of desire. We can add that "the opening of narrative would be represented as the establishment of a conjunctive contractual relation between a sender and a receiver subject, followed by a spatial disjunction between the two actants. The closing of narra- tive would be marked, on the contrary, by a spatial conjunction and a</page><page sequence="22">602 NEW LITERARY HISTORY last transfer of values, instituting a new contract by means of a new distribution of values, which can be either objective or modal" (181- 82). Why then have these characteristics not been incorporated into the surface grammar and why are they attributed to a lack in the sketch? The author circumscribes the difficulty when he observes that these framing sequences correspond to "what are, at the level of the deep grammar, the hypotactic relations of the taxonomic model, that is to say, to the relations which can be established in the model be- tween the terms sI and non-s2 on the one hand, and between the terms S2 and non-sl on the other" (181). Now, what are these hypo- tactic relations, if not relations of presupposition whose weak logical- ity was demonstrated every time the relation of contrariety complet- ing the relation of contradiction in the semiotic square was weakened? Does the critical point revealed by the incompleteness of the sketch not correspond to the critical point in the logical structure of the sketch itself?. This technical discussion shows how difficult it is, on the basis of the "predictable and calculable" (166) syntactic operations, to derive the topological operations of transfer which "organize narration as a pro- cess creating values" (178). The fundamental question raised by Greimas's attempt is related to the nature of the generation, from one deep level of the semiotic model to another. Does the stratification into levels of depth function as the extension into each new stage of the initial virtues of the taxonomic model? Or, on the contrary, does the introduction, at each level, of new semantico-syntactic compo- nents (anthropomorphic representation, addition of figurativity) con- fer richness to the apparatus? In an "Interview" published by Fr6d6ric Nef, Greimas admits that "a theoretical apparatus, no matter how satisfactory it seems at first, could easily remain hypothetical as long as the problem of equivalences between various levels of depth has not been clearly posited, as long as the procedures of conversion from one level to another have not been elaborated" (24). To raise the question in somewhat different terms, one must ask how the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic are equated in Greimas's model. The author's inten- tion is never in doubt: to find for each new syntagmatic addition a paradigmatic equivalent, that is to say, to extend the "squaring" of every process. In this same interview Greimas declares: "If one now considers narrative from its syntagmatic perspective where each nar- rative program appears as a process made up of the acquisition and loss of values, of the enrichment and the impoverishment of subjects, then one notices that each step forward on the syntagmatic axis cor- responds to (and is defined by) a topological displacement on the paradigmatic axis" (25). But if, as we attempted to demonstrate, it is</page><page sequence="23">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 603 true that a syntagmatic newness appeared at each level, under the pressure first of all of a semantics of action, then of praxico-pathetic categories of polemics and exchange, then the innovative power is situated in these praxico-pathetic investments and not in the initial taxonomic model. The author almost admits as much in the very same interview: "However it is only a question there of a manipulatory syntax, through use of disjunctions and conjunctions, of utterances of state which only give a static representation of a series of narrative states of the narrative. Just as the taxonomic square must not be considered simply as a place where logical operations happen, the series of utterances of state are organized and manipulated by utter- ances of doing and by the transforming subjects which are inscribed there" (26). Greimas's topological preoccupations can be seen as an ultimate attempt to extend the paradigmatic as far as possible into the heart of the syntagmatic. Nowhere else does the author feel that he is closer to realizing the dream of making linguistics an algebra of language: "The figurative circulation can thus be considered as the result of the conversion of communications, taking place according to a predict- able order, value objects passing from one subject to another, com- munications that can be represented as disjunctions and conjunc- tions" (25). Thus the topological trajectory simply explicates the prin- ciple of the polemical structure of narrative discourse. Greimas can then declare that "each step forward on the syntagmatic axis corre- sponds to (and is defined by) a displacement on the paradigmatic axis" (25). But, once again, should the priorities not be switched about? In the same way that the syntactic transformations are linked to the morphological relations and the polemical structures are linked to the syntactic transformations, should it not be admitted that the topological displacements in turn are linked to the simple represen- tation of the states at the extremities of the paradigmatic axes? In conclusion, Greimas's model seems to be bound by a dual con- straint, on the one hand logical, and on the other praxico-pathetic. But it can satisfy the former, that of the inscription of the components of narrativity introduced at each new level and pushed on to the following one, only if together the understanding we have of the narrative and of the plot establishes the necessary additions of a de- cidedly syntagmatic order without which the taxonomic model would remain inert and sterile. To recognize the mixed nature of Greimas's model is not at all to refute it: on the contrary, it is to clarify the conditions of its applica- tion and to explain to readers of works stemming from this school why the semiotic square sometimes seems to have a true heuristic</page><page sequence="24">604 NEW LITERARY HISTORY value, and sometimes to be simple transcription, which can be more or less elucidating but sometimes corresponds to a more or less forced understanding of narrative which proceeds not according to the log- ical component, but according to the praxico-pathetic component of the mixed model. PARIS (Translated by Frank Collins and Paul Perron) NOTES 1 Algirdas Julien Greimas, "'l1ments d'une grammaire narrative," in Du sens: Essais sbniotiques (Paris, 1970), p. 164; hereafter cited in text. Here and elsewhere, unless otherwise noted, translations are my own-Tr. 2 "To do this, one must think of semiotic theory in such a way that between the fundamental instances ab quo, where semantic substance takes on its first articulations and constitutes its signifying form, and the last instances ad quem, where signification is manifested through its multiple languages, a vast area must be set up in which a mediating instance is established where semiotic structures having an autonomous status would be situated-the narrative structure would be part of these-a place where the complementary articulations of content and a sort of grammar, at the same time gen- eral and fundamental, commanding the institution of articulated discourses would be worked out" (159--60). A year earlier, Greimas wrote: "Perhaps out of a desire for intelligibility, we can imagine that the human mind, in order to achieve the construction of cultural objects (literary, mythical, pictorial, etc.) starts with simple elements and follows a complex course, encountering on its way constraints to which it must submit, as well as choices which it can make." See Algirdas Julien Greimas, "Les jeux des contraintes s6miotiques," in Du sens, p. 135. 3 "In other words: the generation of signification does not pass through, first of all, the production of utterances and their combination into discourse; it is relayed, in its trajectory, by the narrative structures and it is these that produce meaningful discourse articulated by means of utterances" (161). 4 "The constitutive model is, henceforth, only the elementary structure of significa- tion utilized, as form, to articulate the semantic substance of a microuniverse" (161). 5 For the reader of the "16Cments d'une grammaire narrative," the representation of the semiotic square in its purely morphological form, thus independent of the opera- tions which introduce the first concept of narrativization, seems transparent. This is not the case when one attempts to reconstitute the stages of the constitution of the model by Greimas since Structural Semantics (1966), by taking into account "Les jeux des con- traintes s6miotiques" (1968). The difficulties overcome, the traces of which are more or less erased in the axiomatic presentations of 1968 and 1969, can only be reconstructed if one compares the Greimassian square with its logical and linguistic ancestors and if one measures the distance separating it from its antecedents. It is first of all clear that the semiotic square has nothing in common with Aristotle's, or rather Apuleus's, square: first, the latter is concerned with propositions (labeled A, E, I, O), whereas the level at which Greimas operates is that of the analysis of signification into semes-that is to say, into units which are to lexemes what distinctive features are to phonemes (this is the main feature linking "Les jeux des contraintes s6miotiques" and the "'lments d'une grammaire narrative" with Structural Semantics). Next, the oppositions in Apuleus's square rest on the choice of two pertinent features of the propositions: the quality (affirmation-negation), and the quantity (universal-particular). Hence the</page><page sequence="25">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 605 meaning given to contradiction as the complete opposition between the universal af- firmative (I) and the universal negative (E), and to contrariety as the partial opposition between the universal affirmative (I) and the particular negative (0). For Greimas, contradiction and contrariety are not distinguished on this basis, since sl, non-sl, s2, non-s2 as semes are simple terms. For the same reasons, the semiotic square is not derived from Blanche's hexagon. Of course, the latter is concerned not with proposi- tions, but with predicates belonging to the same category of thought; but these pred- icates are lexicalized terms, whereas for Greimas the basis of the construction is the semantic axis linking the semes. As for the Piaget group, the psychological application of Klein's group, the distinction between contradiction and contrariety, as in Apuleus's square, is founded on the dual nature of the opposed terms (black square, white square, black circle, white circle). Contradiction is therefore a total inversion (black square vs. white circle, black circle vs. white square) and inversion (black square vs. white circle, black circle vs. white square) and contrariety is a partial opposition (black square vs. white square, etc.). From two things one can thus derive the relation: AB, AB, AB, AB. In spite of the fact that Piaget's group operates with lexically perceived objects, its double terms do correspond to Greimas's semic opposition. (For a further development of this, see Structures elfmentaires de la signification, ed. Fr6d6ric Nef et al. [Brussels, 1976], esp. pp. 9-17, 20-21, 28-33, 49-55.) The true filiation of the semiotic square must be sought elsewhere. One must begin with Saussure's thesis that a sign is defined by its difference with other signs in the same system; but one must abandon the Saussurean level of sign for that of seme. Here one encounters the linguist Brondal's epistemology, the role of opposition in Lvi-Strauss's theory of myth, and especially- this is the decisive stage-binary oppositions applied on the phonological level by Ja- kobson to distinctive features, thus to units of the subphonematic level. But it is also in restoring this filiation that the difficulties adumbrated by Greimas's didactic expositions appear. In particular, it is very difficult to make contrariety and contradiction accord- ing to Greimas correspond to one or other of Jakobson's binary oppositions, in partic- ular those referred to by Greimas in "La mythologie compar6e," in Du sens, p. 129: that is to say, a vs. non-a (marked vs. nonmarked), and a vs. -a, where -a is the negation of a. The equivalences, or rather the comparisons, proposed by Nef between Greimas and Jakobson are, in turn, far from convincing; see Fr6d6ric Nef, "Pr6sentation," in Structures ftlmentaires, p. 15. On this point the interview with Greimas throws no new light; see Fr6d6ric Nef, "Entretien avec A. J. Greimas," in Structures Mldmentaires, p. 21, hereafter cited in text. In fact what does contrariety between sl and s2 mean? It opposes two equally positive semes, in which one is the contrary of the other only if one can oppose them as poles, as the extremes of a graded series, consequently as polar qualities of the same category (of the type high vs. low, white vs. black). Will the rigorous conditions of this polar opposition between semes always be respected in the course of the successive investments of the constitutive model? 6 In "Les jeux des contraintes s6miotiques," the distinction between relations and operations, thus between morphology and syntax, is not worked out: thus the name of operations is often given to relations, and the relations of contrariety and contradiction are immediately labeled disjunction and conjunction (137). This is no longer the case in "'lments d'une grammaire narrative." Rigor now demands that morphology be the domain of relations of contrariety, contradiction, and homology, as well as of the no- tion of contrary, contradictory, and homologous terms. It is only on the syntactical level that one can speak about the operations of negation/assertion (manifesting the contrary terms of the axis), of negation/assertion (manifesting the contradictory terms on the schemata), of implication/presupposition (manifesting the homologous terms on the deixis). For further discussion see Georges Combet, "Complexification et carr6 performatoire," in Structures ilmentaires, pp. 68-69.</page><page sequence="26">606 NEW LITERARY HISTORY 7 I will not raise again the issue that semiotics and linguistics are in a relationship of reciprocity. Greimas is correct to say that his semiotics is based on a "fundamental semantics which is different from the semantics of manifestation in linguistics" (160). It nonetheless remains true that it is within the latter that it is effectively constructed. And Greimas characterizes as "universals of language" (162) the categories necessary to formalize the elementary structure of signification. Here linguistics is the paradigm of semiotics. 8 The postulation of this homology is characteristic of structuralism, as Roland Barthes clearly says in his "Introduction A l'analyse structurale des r6cits," Communica- tions, 8 (1966), 3-4, reproduced in Roland Barthes et al., Poetique du ricit (Paris, 1977), pp. 10-13. 9 One should remark Greimas's hesitation concerning the relation of implication: "If the existence of this type of relation seems undeniable, the problem of its orienta- tion (sl--non-s2 or non-s2--*sl) is not yet settled. We will not raise the issue here since its solution is not necessary for the rest of the demonstration"; see "Les jeux des contraintes," p. 37, n. 1. Cf. on this point "Pr6sentation," in Nef, p. 15; and Combet, pp. 68-69. 10 In the "Entretien avec A. J. Greimas," it seems that in the eyes of the author himself the operations must be stressed rather than the relations, or the relations in terms of the operations: "In relationship to the 'Contraintes,' which only raises the problem of the narrative states, the 'Ilements' attempt to make explicit the operations giving rise to narrativizations" (22). Consequently, in the syntactic interpretation the dominant question remains that of "representing how signification is produced by a series of operations creating differentiated positions" (22). Hence the phenomenon of narrativization can be conceived as "a series of logically oriented operations taking place within the framework anticipated by the semiotic square" (22). 11 Again, the critical point remains (cf. above, n. 9) that of the relation of presup- position: "the operation of contradiction which, in negating, for example, the term s l, posits at the same time the term non-sl, must be followed by a new operation of presupposition giving rise and conjoining to the term non-sl the new term s2" (165). Can the operation be at the same time "predictable," thus "calculable," (166) and "new"? 12 The commentators in Fr6d6ric Nef's work suggest that by thus putting the main accent on the operations of transformation, Greimas in a way increases the initial gap between logical opposition and semiotic square. Thus, Alain de Lib(ra, "La semiotique d'Aristote," in Structures Mlfmentaires, p. 41, begins by stating that Apuleus's square was already more than a simple pedagogical device insofar as it engendered a series of permitted operations (concerning the contradiction couples: who refutes E proves I, etc.; the contraries: who proves A, destroys E, but who destroys A does not prove E, etc.); but he does so only in order to deny that the Apulean square is in any way productive (41). Going further, the commentator denies that thought founded on disjunction can have the virtue of a founding a priori: "Disjunction," he says, "is the stabilizing operator of forms necessary for any ontology and for any idealist thought" (47); "logical disjunction borne by the verb to be is the inaugural exterior which re- presses all dialectic" (48). Turning one's back to Aristotle must one now turn to Hegel to give meaning to a productive opposition? This is suggested by de Libtra when he compares Jakobson and Greimas. It is said that one must radically distinguish the logical square from the semiotic square: "There is not (in fact) contradiction in inscrib- ing at the same time sl and -s 1. They are not on the same level. S1 is a term (seme), -sl is an operation on the term (sl), or again: the illocutionary negation of this term" (53). A little further on: "In fact with Greimas (as with LUvi-Strauss) contradiction must be understood in the Hegelian sense" (53). Following Utaker, Alain de Lib(ra, in "Note sur</page><page sequence="27">GREIMAS'S NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 607 'On binary opposition' de Arild Utaker," in Structures ilimentaires, p. 55, interprets the semiotic square as the dual interaction of the qualitative opposition and the privative opposition: "One can thus consider the logical square as a logical apparatus which produces privative oppositions starting with qualitative oppositions. The productivity of the square makes it an open model, a generative structure: all complex or neutral terms of any square can be taken at another level as the simple term generating a new semiotic square. Here is where its applicability resides: myths, tales, etc., and in a general way, every domain where an opposition is 'negated' by the production of a new opposition which at the same time seems to reproduce and not to reproduce the original" (55). In the same vein, Nef's work contains various attempts to engender one semiotic square from another one and thus to complexify the model by a chain of "squarifications" (see Combet, in Nef, pp. 67-72). In the "Entretien," Greimas shows interest in this attempt which accentuates the logical and deductive aspects of semiol- ogy; see Nef, "Entretien," pp. 22-24. But is this logic Aristotelian, Hegelian, or ... other? 13 Anthony Kenny, Action, Emotion and Will (London, 1963). On the analytical phi- losophy of action, see Paul Ricoeur, Simantique de l'action (Paris, 1977), pp. 3-137. 14 Greimas proposes the following example of a wanting which would be anthropo- morphic without being figurative: "this rule requires that .. ." (168). The example, it seems to me, is not valid, since the rule cannot precisely function as the virtual subject of a possible action. The obligation by the rule is of another status than wanting is. 15 The paralogism is the following: "narrative utterances are syntactic utterances, that is to say independent of content which can be invested by such and such a doing" (168). To substitute doing for all action verbs is not to transform them into a syntactic doing. 16 This could have been foreseen: already at the deep level, virtual narrativization consisted in the fact that the dynamic representation of the semiotic square was con- sidered as "a bringing together or as the production of meaning by the subject" (164). 17 See Arthur Danto, Analytical Philosophy of Action (Cambridge, 1973). 18 The result is "the construction of a particular narrative unit, performance: due to the fact that it constitutes the operative schema of the transformation of contents, it is probably the most characteristic unit of narrative syntax" (173). 19 See Max Weber, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, 5th ed. (Tiibingen, 1972). 20 See Weber, "Begriff des Kampfes," in Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, pp. 20-21. 21 In the "Entretien," Greimas insists that the polemic structure of narrative is what permits the unraveling of the initial paradigmatic articulation of the taxonomic model into the entire syntagmatic unfolding of the narrative (25). By opposing an antisubject to a subject, an antiprogram to a program, by even multiplying actantial squares by di- viding every actant into actant, negactant, anatactant, negantactant. The polemic struc- ture ensures the infiltration of the paradigmatic order into all syntagmatic order: "It is not surprising then that the analysis of even slightly complex texts necessitates the multiplication of the actantial positions and so reveals, besides its syntagmatic unrav- eling, the paradigmatic articulation of narrativity" (24). But one can also say the in- verse: It is because something happens of a conflictual nature between two subjects that one can project it onto the square. And this projection is in turn possible because the square itself has been treated "as the place where the logical operations are carried out" (26), in short it has been narrativized beforehand. The entire progress of "squarification" from level to level can appear in turn as the progression of the para- digm to the heart of the syntagmatic, or as the addition of new syntagmatic dimensions (quest, struggle, etc.) secretly finalized by the dual paradigmatic and syntagmatic struc- ture of the finished narrative. 22 "That is, a syntax of operators must be constructed independently from a syntax of</page><page sequence="28">608 NEW LITERARY HISTORY operations: a metasemiotic level must be worked out in order to justify the transfer of values" (178). 23 Claude Br6mond, Logique du ricit (Paris, 1973). 24 Is it for this reason that the author writes that "a metasemiotic level must be worked out in order to justify the transfer of values"? (see n. 23 above). 25 The reader can here formulate a doubt which is the opposite of the one raised by the interpretation of the polemic category. The latter was explicitly superimposed on the relation of contradiction, but also seemed to permit an anthropomorphic interpre- tation of contrariety. On the other hand, topological syntax, after having been explicitly related to the correlation between schemata, and thus to contrariety (176), is then superimposed onto contradiction, which opposes the two subjects s 1 and s2 foreseen by the construction of the performance: "Consequently, it is the axis of exchange between these two subjects which constitutes the place of transfer of the modal values; the attribution of any modal value to sl presupposes that s2 is at the same time deprived of that value" (180).</page></plain_text>
