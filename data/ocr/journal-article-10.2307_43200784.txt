<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal Wayne A. Ham Truth Affirmed, Error Denied: The Great Debates of the Early Reorganization On October 26, 1881, at Tombstone, Arizona, City Marshal Virgil Earp, along with his brothers Wyatt and Morgan and gambler Doc Holliday, all of them riding high on a flow of adrenalin, faced down four local mule rustlers, Ike and Billy Clanton and Tom and Frank McLaury, at the OK Corral. The Clantons and McLaurys had spent the morning touring the saloons of Tombstone boasting they could beat the Earps in a fair fight. Months of whispered innuendos in barrooms and venomous threats suddenly exploded into thirty seconds of staccato gunfire, leaving three lawmen wounded and three rustlers dead. Subsequent legal inquiry cleared the victors- the judge declared that Marshall Earp was acting in the line of duty, but he went on to add that the marshal was ' 'in- judicious and censurable" for enlisting the assistance of Doc Holliday, a derelict dentist who was more handy with a gun than a dental drill. That same year, 600 miles to the north at Lehi, Utah, R. J. Anthony, a missionary for the Reor- ganization, bolstered by the support of W. W. Blair, who was at that time a member of the RLDS Church's First Presidency, was facing down Elders Evans and Thurman of the Utah LDS faith in debate on the proposition "Resolved, that young Joseph Smith is the legal successor of his father." While this confrontation was not so deadly as the one 600 miles south, for the RLDS missionaries high stakes were riding on this showdown. The bullets in this case were carefully selected quotations from the scriptures; other weapons employed were carefully crafted logic and rhetoric. The results of this verbal shoot-out at Lehi were less gory and also less clear than those of the con- flict at Tombstone. The report by W. W. Blair to the Saints' Herald readership grudgingly admitted that "our opponents, Messrs. Evans and Thurman, lawyer-Elders, did well when we consider they were on the wrong side."1 Five persons were baptized into the RLDS Church as a result of the debate, but the Saints' Herald neglects to report how many, if any, abandoned the RLDS endeavor or how many were strengthened in their commitment to the Utah LDS leadership. Who would deny that soured relationships and misunderstandings between the two largest Restoration churches were being addressed more appropriately at Lehi by vigorous debate than by bullets? The showdown at Lehi was only one of many similar debates engineered by the missionaries of the Reorganization. The era of debates was then in full swing, and debating was considered an effective means of evangelism. The reports conveyed by the denomination's weekly periodical, the Saints' Herald , intimated that the RLDS debaters were almost always victorious as they went forth to defend the truth and to challenge error. General Overview In this paper a brief overview of the era of debates, using information gleaned primarily from the Saints' Herald and the Journal of History , will be highlighted, involving 244 reports of debates in the RLDS literature. The first report occurred in 18642 and the final report in 1929, 3 a span of sixty- five years. This paper focuses on the reports of debates, rather than debates themselves. Undoubt- edly, many debates of a more local character or with a less favorable outcome went unreported in the RLDS press. During the era of the great debates, who were the opponents that the RLDS debaters took on in their quest for spreading the gospel? Of the 244 debate reports examined, 108 debates or 44 percent of the total involved representatives of the so-called Campbellite churches, which include the Wayne A. Ham is director of the Program Services Division, RLDS Church headquarters, Independence, Missouri. This paper is the 1986 presidential address of the John Whitmer Historical Association, presented in Kirtland, Ohio, September 27, 1986. 3</page><page sequence="2">Volume Seven 1987 Church of Christ, the Disciples of Christ, and the Christian Churches. Saints' Herald reporters were sometimes confused by the complexity of the "Restoration movement" that was launched by Alexander Campbell. RLDS who are labelled Mormon against their personal preferences will under- stand the frustration no doubt felt in the Campbellite camp over the Saints' Heralƒès inability to keep the scorecard accurate on which Campbellite denomination the debate opponents belonged to. Because of this confusion, all representatives of the Alexander Campbell Restoration have been lumped together in this count. Baptists of many brands and persuasions comprise thirty-three opponents or 14 percent of the op- position. Utah LDS are reported for fourteen debates, or 6 percent of the total, and are generally credited in the literature as being gentlemanly and fair in their debating methodology, perhaps sur- prising in view of the fact that RLDS and Utah LDS relationships were anything but cordial during this period. The Seventh Day Adventists participated in eleven of the debates; Methodists in ten. There were six each for the Christian Adventists and for the United Brethren; the Christadelphians debated in four, all outside the United States (two in Ontario and two in New South Wales); and four involved Spiritualists. The remaining debates were conducted with representatives of other groups of the Joseph Smith Restoration such as the Strangites, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), and the East- man faction in Utah; or with representatives of a wide spectrum of Christian Churches such as the Congregationalists, the Universalists, the Church of God, the Presbyterian Church, the Holiness Church, the Dunkards, Church of God of the Faith of Abraham, and the Millennial Dawn Faith. Some debates were held with representatives of anti-Mormon societies, such as the Utah Gospel Mis- sion, the International Bible Study Association, and the Anti-LDS Society. A few debate opponents cannot be identified with any religious organizations, but are instead identified individually as in- fidels, or deist, or communist, or phrenologist. Interestingly enough, the 1882 debate with the phrenologist focused not on reading head lumps but rather on the integrity of Joseph Smith, Jr. A certain Mr. Nash came to Illinois lecturing on sci- ence and phrenology. The Methodists and Baptists combined to hire him to meet the Mormons in debate to prove that Joseph Smith was an imposter and the Book of Mormon false. The debate, orig- inally scheduled for four days, died on day 3 when some of Nash's employers deserted him in the heat of battle. RLDS debater G. H. Hillyard had prevailed in debate, at least according to G. H. Hillyard.4 The debate with the communist took place in 1921 at Leeds, England, with 500 people in atten- dance.5 The issue for this debate was wherein lies the economic solutions to the world's prob- lems-in the gospel of Christ as represented in the RLDS Church or the gospel of Marx as advocated by the Communist party. This may be the only debate in which the scriptures were barred from use. The vast majority of the debates dealt with the so-called standard propositions, consisting of usually three resolutions in some variant form: 1. Resolved, that the RLDS Church is the only church that is identical in doctrine, practice, and organization with the church established by Christ himself. 2. Resolved, that the (other) Church is the church that best conforms in worship, doctrine, and practice with the church established by Christ in the New Testament. 3. Resolved, that the Book of Mormon is true/fraudulent and Joseph Smith, Jr., is a true/false prophet of God. Other debates ranged far afield from the standard propositions, often reflecting the doctrinal agen- da of the opposition. With Utah LDS, for example, debate topics included, Which Restoration church is the legal continuation of the church restored through Joseph Smith? and, Is polygamy of God? With other Christians, the vast theological diversity of Christendom's Protestant churches is evi- dent in the topics for debate: Is there consciousness between death and the resurrection? (of interest to many groups espousing the doctrine of "soul sleeping") Which day is the Sabbath? (Seventh Day Adventists and Seventh Day Baptists said Saturday.) Will the Jews be regathered to the Promised Land? Will the punishment of the wicked last forever? Was there an apostasy from the true faith that Christ established? Is the Inspired Version of the Bible better than the King James Version? What is the proper mode of baptism and is it necessary for salvation? What is the nature of the Trinity? 4</page><page sequence="3">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal How many resurrections will there be, one or two or none? Can spiritualism really establish contact with the dead? Thirty-three of the debates took place in Illinois. Other hot spots for debate were Iowa and Okla- homa, each with twenty-three and Missouri with twenty. In all, thirty-one of the fifty states were the locales for debates, as well as two Canadian provinces (Ontario and Alberta), New South Wales, England, and Wales. A map of where the debates were held a century ago shows a high correlation with the current RLDS membership concentration in Canada and the United States. A total of 116 different RLDS ministers served as debaters. Fifteen debates, the most by any single debater, were conducted by Apostle J. F. Curtis from 1908 to 1928. Other popular debaters for the RLDS cause with five or more debates each were Isaac Sheen (7 debates), Mark Forscutt (5), R. M. Elvin (5), J. J. Cornish (5), I. N. White (10), S. W. L. Scott (5), T. C. Kelley (6), Hubert Case (5), A. M. Baker (9), F. M. Slover (5), William Aylor (5), and L. G. Holloway (6). Davis H. Bays occupies the unique position of having been represented on each of the opposing sides, debating first as an RLDS seventy in 18786 and twenty years later against the RLDS Church as a Disciples of Christ minister.7 In his RLDS incarnation, according to a news item in the San Antonio Texas Express ,* Bays arrived a full day late for the debate, inconveniencing 300 spectators. When the debate finally got started on the second day, two hours after the announced starting time thanks to Brother Bays' proclivity to tardiness, the proposition under scrutiny was "Resolved, that the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants contain the word of God and that the doctrine taught in them is in perfect accord with the Bible." In spite of his tardy entry into the fray, Bays won, according to the disinterested Express report, because 4 'he seems to have been raised on the 'Book of Mormon,' and he appears to be peculiarly adapted to that kind of diet." Twenty years later, with many personal bridges crossed and burned, Bays, now denying the Book of Mormon, faced RLDS debaters first in Iowa and later in Nebraska. Bays' past often betrayed him in these later debates. He affirmed, for example, that miracles no longer occur. F. A. Smith, the RLDS represen- tative, disclosed an early letter from Bays to the Saints' Herald, affirming miracle after miracle in his ministry as an RLDS seventy. Bays also kept making the charge that RLDS elders never tell the truth, until his opponent reminded the crowd and Bays that Bays himself had been an RLDS elder for twenty-seven years.9 The First Debates In 1864, in miserable winter weather in Lindsley, Canada West (now Ontario), Missionary John Shippy met in debate with Baptist minister Abram Duncan. 10 In spite of the bad weather, 350 to 400 hearty Canadians, identified as "mostly women from the country," paid ten cents admission to hear Shippy affirm the following resolutions: 1. That the Church of Jesus Christ is distinguished from other organizations by officers of priesthood 2. That the Jews will literally be regathered 3. That there was an apostasy and restoration 4. That there will be a millennial reign Interest ran so high that a follow-up debate between Shippy and I. B. Richardson of the Methodist Episcopal Church was announced to take place at the same site, on the gifts of the Spirit, apostolic teachings, and the apostasy and restoration. Richardson happened to be the editor of the Methodist periodical Western Union. Shippy, the RLDS, informs us of his victory but notes, "My opponent would not comply with the common rules of discussion. . .so I had to do my best under adverse circumstances."11 The Western Union news story, however, reported that RLDS Shippy "had failed to make good his affirmation in a single point and that he had met with a complete defeat, and received for his pains a merited castigation."12 Shippy, of course, was astonished to see such a willful misrepresen- tation of reality in the Methodist press. But he took comfort in the fact that the readership of the Saints' Herald surely knew the score. Truth was being defended by Shippy in an aggressive way and error was being routed by proper use of scriptural authority, reason, and personal testimony, all to the glory of God and the validation of the Reorganization. The era of debating in the RLDS Church was now launched and would not run its course until six decades had passed. General Tenor of the Saints' Herald Reports Judging from the vast majority of the reporters for the Saints' Herald, the RLDS debaters were 5</page><page sequence="4">Volume Seven 1987 virtually unbeatable. Some reports tell of the opposition giving up, going home early, feigning ill- ness, or eschewing challenges to further debates, or worse. In the Smith-Worley debate of 1883, the debate prompted mob action against the homes where the RLDS debaters were staying. According to Heman Smith, his opponent C. A. Worley was "responsi- ble for all this trouble, and did all he could to encourage mobocracy. True, he spoke out publicly against it, and yet he threw out insinuations and made false statements, calculated to stir up the passions of these base men."13 When the mob did not deter the debaters on the last day of the debate, Worley claimed to be so sick that he could not eat dinner and so sick that he could not stay any longer for the debate. The letter from Heman Smith continues, "You will all know how to sym- pathize with him in his sickness, when I tell you he was pleading law at Manchester the next day. ' ' On occasion the RLDS claim to victory was substantiated by independent sources. For example, in the Hilliard-Stone debate of 1871 in Illinois, the following was reported from the Wayne County press: "An opinion seems generally prevalent in town that Elder Stone was rather beaten in the debate- all things considered. Elder Hilliard is a little hard to handle, notwithstanding the badness of the cause he labors for."14 We are informed that as a result of the debate ten were baptized into the RLDS Church. More often, however, the accounts of the results of the debates diverged when both RLDS and independent sources are cited. For example, a reprint from the Apostolic Review concerning the Baker-Roberts debate of 1919 states: Mr. Baker [the RLDS] is a good speaker , and his people consider him among their best debaters. He spends a good part of his time talking about his opponent , does everything he can to prej- udice the people's minds against him. But it did not profit him any at Nebo; every argument he presented was answered by Brother Roberts Most of the Mormons say the reason they don 't like to debate Brother Roberts is because heis "too abusive , " but that is just an excuse they hide behind. I have never heard any debater treat his opponent with any more fairness than Brother Roberts did Mr. Baker. We did all we could to get Mr. Baker to affirm that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God , but he refused to do so! And he just the same as said he never expected to beat Brother Roberts in another debate. 15 W. A. Guthrie, on the other hand, writing to the Saints' Herald about the same debate indicates that the Roberts' stock in trade was the same old rehash of threadbare anti-Mormon epithets and foul, malicious phraseology One Baptist minister said to me that every Baptist he had heard said our man had bested Roberts When Brother Baker would show up his methods , Roberts would whine and say Baker was attacking him personally. In one of his speeches on the so-called Church of Christ propositions I kept account of such words as the following: " Old Joe, imposter, you [Baker] don 't know , liar, thief, Mormons, Mormonism, ignorant, reverend from hell, skunk, immorality, cry baby, tramps, drunkard, murderer, impostor, infidel, false B√±ghamism, dishonest trickery. " These words were used as nouns and adjectives concerning Joseph Smith and our church interchangeably forty-nine times in one speech. Multiply this number by the twenty-eight speeches he had and you have the approximate number of epithets used by the man in the name of "true" religion The confusion became so great and the disorder so rampant that I suggested to the Campbellite moderator that if he had any respect for his own house he would quell the rabble and place Brother Baker and I under arrest as we were anxious to meet it in court. A dozen voices rang out: "That's fair, " " that's what I say, " etc. However, we have not been arrested yet. 16 On only two occasions did the Saints' Herald admit to an obvious failure for the RLDS cause: Br. M. H. Forscutt lately held a debate with Rev. W. B. F. Treat, at Lilly Dale, Perry County, Indiana, of which, neither Br. Forscutt nor Br. D. F. Lambert unites very encouragingly. We await further news, as the letters of these two give us no details, nor the result ; except Br. Lambert's statement: " I can not conscientiously use those flaming words, 'It was a glorious victory for the truth; ' but this much I feel assured of, that those who loved the truth before the debate, love it still; and those who were seeking an excuse for rejecting it, had it given to them. Br. Mark acted nobly, for although Treat was very unfair, and very abusive, he never conde- scended to do any more than fairly remind him that he realized how he was treated. " Br. Mark's health was not good during this discussion. 17 In the Drown-Sanderson debate in Michigan in 1881, RLDS Elder Drown was preaching against Utah LDS Elder Sanderson. At the end a vote was taken, twenty-three for Utah LDS Sanderson and nineteen for RLDS Drown. The question was on the priesthood. ' 'The first evening a good house full attended, the second only about half as many. The debate resulted in considerable good to the cause, 6</page><page sequence="5">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal notwithstanding the vote was adverse to Bro. Drown."18 A most ei'joyable response to a debate is noted in a melodramatic report that- yes, there is life after a debate. J. C. Mabbott reporting on the Long-Hull debate of 1920 writes: Now that the war clouds have rolled away and the thunder of the big guns is silenced , and calm and quiet again reign over our city of Spearfish , South Dakota , it may be of interest to some to hear about the battle between Elder E. E. Long and Robert R. Hull , of the Campbellite persua- sion, which began here September 20, and continued sixteen nights. It took several days for the smoke to clear up enough so we could see just what the results of the conflict were, but as days pass and the effects of the "gas" that the enemy employed works off the minds of the people, and as the atmosphere becomes more pure from the stench of the putrid matter that he shed abroad, we are having more and more to rejoice about because of the friendly sentiments that are being expressed by the more intelligent class that heard part or all of the discussion Brother Long's task was easy. And when he got through, the wonder tomeis how Hull will ever be able to gather up the fragments. One night during the first proposition the presiding officer led in the applause of one of Brother Long's statements. At another time he became so enwrapped in Brother Long's argument that he forgot to notice the time and let him run over a few minutes. One prominent auto dealer stated that he quit attending the debate because it took so much of Long's time to answer Hull's harangue that it was a waste of time to go. 19 Mark Forscutt as Debater The RLDS community's most gentlemanly and most respected debater was perhaps Mark Forscutt. Forscutt made a significant mark on the developing RLDS movement through his committee work in preparing the Inspired Version for publication and also in church hymnody, and the Saints were justifiably proud of his ability to turn aside sarcasm and ridicule of his debate opponents without compromising his own integrity. From a quote from the Mondata Bulletin , we discover that in the Forscutt-Elzea debate in 1871, 600 listeners decided almost unanimously in favor of Forscutt. A local celebrity, a certain Dr. Adair, then made a few insulting remarks, which drew from Forscutt only a smile and handshake.20 At the Forscutt-Wray debate in Iowa in 1872, the people almost cer- tainly would have given Forscutt the vote but Wray requested that the popular vote not be taken. Immediately seven members of Wray's parish voted by requesting baptism at the hands of Mark Forscutt.21 The Riverton Advocate gives an unusual tribute: Mr. Forscutt has but few peers as an orator and scholar. He talks so rapidly, forcibly, and elo- quently that one listening never gets weary. There seems to be nothing in literature or science beyond the scope of his mind. He is a severe and pitiless critic. Some find it hard to believe that he can be sincere in professing a belief in anything so absurd as the Mormon religion. He looks more fit to grace the bar than the pulpit.22 Forscutt was not so gentlemanly as to be a pushover. For example, a debate was held between Forscutt and Reverend Denton in Iowa in 1877. In the Advocate for December 27, there was a brief account of the discussion: Mr. Forscutt. . . satisfied the people that if there was a man living that could put a decent face upon the doct√±ne he was the man. He certainly displayed an amount of ability that is seldom met with. Mr. Denton declared that the Latter Day Saints' Church was but a sugar-coated ar- rangement of the Brighamite Church. That it would eventually lead its proselytes to Salt Lake City where they would be consigned to Brigham 's " grease house. "Mr. Forscutt thought that a combination of Latter Day Saints grease, and Campbellite lye (lie) would enable Brigham to set up an extensive soap factory, [providing] a bountiful supply if not a desirable article of soap. 23 Most Creative Reporting Daniel Macgregor writing about the Macgregor-Glendenning debate of 1922 takes a highly creative, humorous approach to the report: Some few weeks ago while in Toronto, word came from the Twelve that my services were re- quired in Jonesport, Maine, to diagnose the disorder of Adventism which had broken out in an uncontrollable way. Our people were challenged to debate. Communicating with Elder O. L. Thompson, our local missionary at Jonesport, I assured him that I was delightfully willing to do what I could towards arresting the malady, providing he could assure me a " boiled lobster. " 7</page><page sequence="6">Volume Seven 1987 Accordingly, the brother advised me that the lobster was ready , but they would "defer the boiling " until my arrival. The Adventist operation came first. It was under the ether for two days. Considerable probing and disemboweling had to be performed , for the subject was in an advanced state of decomposition. Things were jingling joyfully. The largest hall in town had been secured and although it seated between six hundred and seven hundred , it was far too small to accommodate the crowds - The first two evenings were taken up with an examination of the Adventist Church - Well, it was a walkover. Never had an easier thing in my life. It will probably be ungraceful for me to recite our achievements, so I will merely repeat the poetic expression of one of our Baptist sisters who, after attending the funeral, stated in emphatic tones to a personal friend, "Well, you should have heard it; the Latter Day Saints sent the Adventist Church straight to / ' ' On the third night the Latter Day Saint proposition was up The Adventists inaudibly groaned, but it was our innings and we were in for home runs I knew that we had our op- ponent in a " death grip" that would demonstrate his soul-sleeping theory to a nicety - Funny things happened at the close of the debate. It then became every man 's discussion and the ladies were as eloquent as the men. For a full hour they lingered. Some of the outsiders were anxious to put Glendenning out of business for his insulting remarks. Fully ninety-five percent of this great audience were with us - The previous evening poor old Glendenning, unused to the rocking of the boat, fell overboard, and was rescued little the worse for his pickling in a dry state. We can therefore truthfully report that up to date one immersion has resulted from the debate, although in this case very little of " remission of sins" took place - Well, we've had our lobster all right, and boiled, too.u Greatest Archvillain among the Opposition The Saints' Herald reports eleven debates in which Clark Braden of the Disciples of Christ was the opponent. By 1901, however, Braden was claiming fifteen debates (and incidentally fifteen vic- tories) with eight different RLDS debaters, in addition to many, many last minute back-outs by RLDS ministers who lost their nerve at the last moment. Braden probably ranks with John C. Ben- nett, Brigham Young, and R. C. Evans as characters of almost mystic proportions, characters whom RLDS loved to hate. Even though Braden never was affiliated with the Joseph Smith Restoration, many RLDS followed his career closely with almost prurient fascination. In 1883 a debate took place between Braden and E. L. Kelley in Nebraska on the standard proposi- tions. This was the first mention of Braden in the RLDS press. The reporter claimed that at one point Brother Kelley so completely overturned the argument of Braden that in his last speech Braden stood silent as if dumb.25 When his silence became painful to all present, Brother Kelley broke the spell by requesting the moderators not to count the time thus lost against him. Naturally, Braden's recollection of this debate differs. In the following year, 1884, occurred the Great Kirtland Debate between E. L. Kelley and Braden, a debate that was reported verbatim in the Saints ' Herald and then published by Herald House in a book that remained a best seller for decades. No good word was ever said about Clark Braden in the RLDS press. Page after page are devoted to his evil exploits, especially his unfair debating practices. One particularly unforgiving article in the Herald called Braden the man with the big knife(?) dealing deathly blows to the undaunted, unsullied, and stargemmed brow of the kingdom of Christ, with the questionable lever of extirpation to the very base rock of the divine home on earth, the church. Like the cuttlefish [Braden] stirred up the marl and ooze, and retreated under the murky filth of his own creating.‚Ñ¢ Church leadership recommended that RLDS ministers not debate Braden because of his dirty tricks and unscrupulous debating methodology. About this time, by the way, Braden was having difficulty getting the endorsement of his own church. Decline of Debates In the earliest days of the era of debates it was almost implicit in the reporting that any debate was justifiable, that any RLDS elder could defend truth successfully, and that any debate would end in an RLDS victory since truth will prevail. The First Presidency later took several editorial op- portunities to instruct the debaters to always maintain courtesy and decorum.27 If lay members were invited to have a controversy, it would be preferable to have a competent minister substitute for 8</page><page sequence="7">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal Handbill in which Clark Braden chattenges ELDS to debate 9</page><page sequence="8">Volume Seven 1987 them, it was affirmed. Contending for the faith is acceptable but it must be done by qualified per- sonnel. The day is past when it is necessary to meet all mud-slingers in battle. As the era of debates drew to a close, the arena for debate shifted from public confrontation be- tween denominational representatives to debating societies within the church, mostly involving the women and youth. As an example, in 1923 in St. Thomas, Ontario, the Department of Women had a social evening in which it was debated whether the branch should build a new church edifice. Of course, it was clearly indicated that no action would be taken of any official nature and the debate was preceded by a musical program beforehand and a light lunch after. The judges, not apparently willing to offend anyone, declared a tie.28 Religio, the society for young people, sponsored church-wide debates on "Resolved, that the civ- ilization of the Nephites was greater than that of Egypt,"29 and other weighty topics. The last recorded interdenominational debate occurred in 1929 between L. G. Holloway and Church of Christ minister William Freeman Jones in Missouri. The Saints' Herald reporter, rem- iniscent of the good old days, noted that 95 percent of the audience voted for Holloway.30 Out with a bang! The great era of debates was officially over. Conclusion In the process of ranging through sixty-five years of Saints' Heralds in search of debate reports, I have come to sense some of the positive values of debating in the RLDS movement as well as some of the inherent problems in this particular mode of ecumenical interaction. Would that openness to de- bating had flourished in the church during the Far West period and the Nauvoo period! Perhaps our history would be much different today if debate had been allowed. I much prefer the free market- place of ideas and the open exchange of information in debate to the practice of organizing secret councils and paramilitary organizations in the Restoration movement. Not long ago I travelled through the nations of Eastern Europe. One thing evident behind the Iron Curtain is the proclivity to discourage anything that even remotely resembles debate. Lack of in- formation and actual disinformation appeared to be the rule; I found myself feeling a growing ap- preciation for the culture I live in, for our society which has kept alive the tradition of debate and tolerance for dissent. I am grateful that debate is still possible, at least on some issues, in the bus- iness conferences of my own particular faith community, as well as through the more academic forums of the JWHA and the MHA, two distinguished associations in which I am privileged to par- ticipate. The value of these debates for the RLDS membership over time is that they certainly were in- strumental in expanding the membership's awareness of other churches and other systems of belief. Interfaith understanding was enhanced as verbatims of debates were printed in the Saints' Herald and in Herald House books. The debates pushed the participating RLDS ministry, a nonprofessional lay clergy, to more rigorous scrutiny of the Bible and helped develop a certain competence in pulpit oratory. The debates also provide some interesting insights into how far the RLDS Church has moved from its sectarian origins toward the Christian mainstream. For example, in the Blodgett-Polhemus debate of 1895, Mr. Polhemus, a United Brethren by affiliation, claimed that the infinite God was incomprehensible to ,our finite minds, and that the Bible does not prove the existence of God, but simply assumes in faithful witness to the world that God exists. This was rebutted with scorn by the RLDS representative who affirmed that God is definitely like man in form; Blodgett provided a pro- digious outpouring of biblical references to prove the anthropomorphic nature of Deity.31 Most present-day RLDS would find themselves in this case rooting for the opposition. In the Davis-Padget debate of 1882, RLDS debater Davis rejected the wording of a proposition stating that the RLDS Church is a part of the Church of Christ organized by him and his apostles, and insisted that it more exclusively read that the RLDS Church is in fact the same in faith, organization, and blessings as the church organized by Christ.32 Such a distinction was important to those who believed that the RLDS organization was the "one and only true church," and the only church with whom God was well pleased. Most modern RLDS would have stuck with the first, more ecumenical, proposition. Finally, I note with interest the Bronson-Padget debate of 1886 when Reverend Padget of the Dis- ciples of Christ affirmed the "priesthood of all believers." Brother Bronson, with irony and mock shock in his voice, chastised his opponent for even considering the idea that a woman could ever be in the priesthood.33 Well, sic transit gloria hominis. 10</page><page sequence="9">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal Let us pay homage to all of those who contributed to the debates, protagonists and antagonists alike, all men of great courage. We can only imagine how taxing it would be to enter into a lengthy debate with a skilled opponent whose chief aim in life, at least for the time being, was to make you look rather silly. But countless men in the era of debate accepted the challenge and entered into the fray, believing that through this means they were advancing the cause of truth and serving the king- dom of their God. Perhaps their willingness to take the competitive, animalistic urge to destroy that seems to inhabit the human psyche and civilize that urge by channeling it into arenas of public debate contributed along with other factors, of course, to the shaping of our modern society, which prizes so very much the freedom of belief and free speech. So thanks to you, E. L. Kelley, hero of 1884, and also to you, Archvillain Braden, for your splash of color added to a grand mosaic of life lived long ago, for what you represented as you toiled in debate at Kirtland over a century ago. May our current endeavors in the JWHA arena of historical exploration and debate, as did your en- deavors a century ago, help keep alive the spirit of honest discussion and open inquiry that nourishes us all in our own quest for truth and fulfillment.
