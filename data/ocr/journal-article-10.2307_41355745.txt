<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON BOOKS. Atomic Theories. By F. H. Loring. London: Methuen and Co., Ltd., 1921. 12*. M. net. In these days of consideration for the pounds, shillings and pence, we may perhaps be excused for noting with satisfaction that the price for a wórk of" .the present scale, scope and ' quality, is low if measured by to-day's rates ; a fact which gives ground for congratulation to the publishers, and which may afford good augury as regards the prices of the higher grade books in the near future. The present book consists of 218 -f X. large octavo pages, with 66 figures in the text, and the price is 12/6 net. Our feeling of satisfaction at the lowness of price implies a somewhat hearty approval of Mr. Loring's work, as an unsatisfactory book is dear even at a low price. The author takes his readers faithfully and well througfi the difficult and narrow way of recent research and speculation as regards atomic constitution, and in turning over the pages a first impression of the reader will be a sentiment of satisfaction at the large amount of detail as to recent aspects and researches. Study of the Kinetic theory of gases (p.3) is a good »introduction, and it is pointed out in what sense the four gas laws may be inexact : distilrbances arising which may perhaps be termed "inter-gravitational," for want of a better term. This study may lead us towards thè old argument of Wollaston (Daubeny on the atomic theory, 2nd. edition, Oxford, 1850 p. 125) that if the constitution of the gases is atomic there should be a limit to our atmos- phere, a sentiment in general accord with our author's 2nd. chapter (p. 8) in which we find a short but lucid account of Sir J. J. Thom- son's method of recording the single impact of an atomic mass on a photographic plate and plotting out dotted lines or curves by sequent impacts. This method of research opens out new vistas (p. 8 to 14) as to estimating masses, and by improvements due to Aston certain atomic masses have been estimated with a conjectural accuracy of about one part in a thousand. The details of this surprising progress in the study of the nature of matter are lucidly, sequently, and exactly indicated in Mr. Loring's remarkable book, but we may perhaps attempt to give our readers a faint concept of the principles which underlie the means by which the relative weights or masses of individual atoms or molecules may" be estimated, even in a mixture containing masses of varying magni- tude ; and it is conceivable that developments of this method may ultimately lead to the automatic plotting out in graphic form of all the relative weight of the atomic masses and also the relative proportions. In this spirit we may drêam until we imagine all the elements automa- tically recording or charting their own charac- teristics in number, measure, weight, and relative proportion. Imagine a high attenuation in a vacuum apparatus and atomic masses flying off in random directions, while a long narrow tube serves to sort out such particles as fly in one direction. By virtue of the electric charge or associate electron, each particle, atom ' or quasi- atom may, under proper conditions, imprint a minute developable spot on a photo- graphic plate : this making it possible to obtain a tinge record as to the incidence of each mass as it impinges upon a traversing sensitive surface. Let us now suppose a stream or sequence of individual atoms emerging from the outer end of the long narrow tube, and on this stream an electro- magnetic field or other like deflecting* agency is brought into play. It is obvious that the constituent atoms of the stream may thus be äorted out according to their responsivity to the deflecting influence.

A remarkable vista of ultimate pro- gress thus suggests itself, in the shape of a photo- graphic plate covered with dotted curves each being produced by particles of like mass. To- wards this aim much has been realised, as will be evident to any one who reads Mr. Loring's work. One immediate result, as recorded in the second chapter, is that good reason is found for the conjecture that some of our 44 elements" ("quoad nos Elements," to use the term adopted by Dr. Daubeny to avoid such verbal solecisms as compound atom, or compound element, see p. 428 of his 2nd. edition of 1850, mentioned above) are compound in the sense of being composed of constituents which differ in atomic weight or mass by whole numbers, and that it is the mixture of these whole number isotopes (Soddy uses the term iso tope as indicating that they occupy the same field or locality in the periodic system) which gives rise to some, many, or perhaps all of the departures from Prout's law of whole numbers : hydrogen, however, appears to stand isolated in this respect. It is impossible even to hint at all of Mr. Loring's many co-ordinated matters, but we may mention dicta as to the nature of light- emission, the Zeeman effect, and inter-atomic spaces being apparently related to the planetary distances ; also we may mention one figure or parable given by Mr. Loring to aid the imagination in forming a concept of the starry heavens in miniature. Our author tells us (p.82) to suppose the whole starry heavens as seen by man to be proportionally reduced until contained in an ordinary room, and then the individual units would be as invisible as are the molecules in air. The octet theory which follows is based on an attempt to apply the recognised laws of electrical attraction and repulsion to the study of the stable equilibrium of particles, and the conclusion is that atoms generally possess a property that may be more or less indicated by the similitude "cubic symmetry," and it may be noticed that the graphic formula of pyrophosphoric acid as represented on page 109, according to the octet theory, rather recalls the graphic notation of Crum Brown, as adopted by Frankland in his lecture notes for chemical students, London, 1866 : but the figurative units of Crum Brown are spherical, while those of the octet theory are cubical. If reference is made to Dr. Daubeny' s work mentioned above, it will be seen that the atomic theories of Leucippus, and also his cosmogony (p. 12) have an interesting parity with what is stated by Mr. Loring as to atomic energies ; also distances in relation to the heavenly bodies and their orbital conditions ; while in the Pythagorean doctrine of numbers (p. 29) there is some germ of the octet idea : indeed this octet view runs more or less through the writings of the atomiste of ancient times. Dr. Daubeny in the work which we mention, gives a very' good summary of ancient views on atomism ; mainly Indian, Greek, and Roman. As the many merits of Mr. Loring's book make it prob- able that in a sequence of editions it will become the standard work on atomic theories, it may be well for the author to re-consider and revise his account ( p. I ) of the views said to be attri- buted to Democritus : possibly in some Greek play intended to burlesque the views of the atomists who in Athens were popularly held to be heterodox by reason of their teachings as to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, and their rejection of the anthropomorphic deities of Greek mythology. Dr. Daubeny (p. 462 of his 1850 edition) gives high praise to Democritus as one who set the example of questioning nature by experi- ment and refers to Bacon's eulogium of Democritus with respect to his profound acquain- tance with physical Science, and mention is made of the way he was "ridiculed by the vulgar," e.g. in Athens. In short, as present-day investi- gations have made the atomic theory almost a reality, it is expedient that future editions and other works on the subject should be prefaced by connected notes on the views held in ancient times, Dr. Daubeny's book represents good work and scholarship up to the date of its publication, and something has been done since by French chemists. One great difficulty is to attach correct meanings to the terms used in the older writings, especially those of Athens in the period of Pericles and subsequently.</page></plain_text>
