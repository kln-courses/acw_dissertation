<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews Religion in Childhood and Adolescence: A Comprehensive Review of the Research. By Kenneth E. Hyde. Pp 483 + index. Birmingham, Alabama: Religious Education Press, 1990. $18.95 hardcover. ISBN 0-89135-076-4. Any volume that cites well over 1600 books, journal articles and unpublished theses, and concludes with a subject index occupying nearly forty pages, is going to be enormously useful. There is no doubt that Hyde's 'comprehensive review' of the empirical research in the psychology of (mainly Christian) religion, particularly that relating to the religious development of children and adolescents - but eschewing depth psychology - will quickly become a standard resource work for all who are interested in this broad field. Hyde draws mainly on English sources, primarily from the British Isles and the United States but also from other parts of the English-speaking world. Where it is relevant he helpfully distinguishes studies that arise in very different cultural and religious contexts. Early publications are not neglected, but most of the works surveyed come from the last two decades. Although the focus is primarily on children and youth a great deal of this literature is relevant to adult religiousness. Thus the book can be recommended to researchers and educators whose interest is in the adult field as well as to those concerned with the religious education of children and young people in school and church contexts. The opening chapters deal with religious thinking, in particular the Piagetian studies of Elkind and Goldman. Here, and in a detailed appendix, he provides an analysis of the criticisms of Piagetian stage theory and concludes both that 'there is good reason for the continued use of a Piagetian model for the study of religious thinking but with qualifications' (p. 379), and that 'the overall description of religious thinking set out by Goldman remains the best guide so far available' (p. 380). The influence of Goldman's work, particularly his claim that formal operational thinking ('abstract thinking') about religion is hardly to be found before the subject reaches a mental age of 13 years, was enormous. Agreed Syllabuses of RE were rewritten in the 1960s mainly in response to Goldman's claims: the old lists of 'good miracle stories' being largely replaced by non-biblical themes for younger age groups. Since then curriculum development in RE has been more influenced by the philosophy of education than by its psychological sister-discipline, and Goldman's studies are by no means as well known as they used to be. It will be interesting to see whether Hyde's espousal of his cause will renew interest in this debate among religious educators. Among the 'new approaches' to religious thinking, Hyde summarizes Fowler's faith development theory and its many critics. He gives more weight to the criticisms, and regrets that Fowler's theory 'ignores much recent work in the psychology of religion' (p. 52). Oser's stage theory of religious judgement is treated with rather more respect. The chapters devoted to children's ideas of God bring together a wide variety of studies, many of which agree in discerning a development from fantasy through concrete anthropomorphic imagery to a theology of God as 'Spirit'. Attempts to correlate the children's God images with their perceptions of actual or ideal parents 437</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS are fraught with difficulties, and Hyde seems to agree with those who argue that the results are not clear enough to confirm or refute Freud's claims about the origin of the former in projection from the latter. A survey of work on 'religious beliefs and their development' incorporates some interesting accounts related to the meaning and efficacy of prayer, including the claim from a Jewish study that the development of such beliefs occurs in different ways with children of different degrees of religious commitment/types of religiousness (p. 115). The understanding of religious language is clearly central to all the above topics. Hyde devotes a whole chapter to research on the understanding of parables, allegories and myths, and an appendix to metaphor comprehension in childhood (where both culture and the individual's development have their effect, not all such development being of a Piagetian type). A brief survey follows of studies in other subject areas of the curriculum, and of the all too few pieces of research that investigate the effects of teaching styles on pupil's learning in the religious domain. Attitude to religion has been the subject of extensive research since the work of the Thurstone and Cave in the 1920s. Hyde's own research in the 1960s involved a study of the relationship between (a) attitudes to religion and the church, (b) religious behaviour, and (c) the development of religious concepts. Along with later studies this confirmed that girls normally show greater religiousness than boys, that there is a decline in positive attitude to religion with age, and that church attendance usually has a positive influence on the attitudes tested. The considerable literature in this field generated by Leslie Francis is given due weight in Hyde's book, indeed studies authored or co-authored by Francis represent the single largest entry in the bibliography. In a later chapter on the religious influence of schools, this work is taken up again and the general pattern of deterioration in children's attitude to religion over time (with regard both to their age and to the date of the survey) is found to be compounded by the unexpected negative influence of some (Anglican) church schools on their pupils' attitude to Christianity. In Hyde's chapter this work can be compared and contrasted with the - inevitably rather different - results obtained in American parochial schools and from some particularly interesting studies in Northern Ireland and Australia. Hyde concludes that the cumulative effect of all this research 'shows that while parents have the strongest influence on their children's religiousness, the school also has an independent influence which arises from the school climate. It is not the result of formal religious education but is due to the attitudes that are fostered and the effectiveness of pastoral care. It can be negative even in a church school' (p. 333). The chapter on religious experience notes the 'great deal of confusion' that arises with regard to its definition and description (p. 165). Although the researches of Hood and his associates in the United States, and Hay and others from the Religious Experience Research Unit in this country are interesting in their different ways, the reader is often left wondering about the status of the word 'religious' in the psychologist's understanding of religious experience. Questions of uniqueness, and about the relationship between experience and interpretation arise here, as do more philosophical questions about the cognitivity of religious experience. Similar questions come to mind in response to the psychological studies of conversion which Hyde reviews. The volume goes on to show us that studies of 'personality and religion' (using the Eysenck Junior Personality Inventory, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and other personality scales) have given a variety of results, perhaps not unrelated to the difficulty of personality testing itself. Some studies claim that there are no personality effects on religiousness. All studies of the development of religiousness are clearly 438</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS dependent on the definition and measurement of its different aspects or dimensions, topics which are treated in further appendices in Hyde's book. (The whole set of appendices constitutes a most useful addition to the text, directing the serious reader to some fundamental questions in the psychology of religion, and preventing the less committed student from ignoring such major issues entirely.) Parental influences on religiousness have been surveyed in a number of different contexts. Hyde brings these together with accounts of social influences and of secularization. It is particularly interesting to read the claim of one study that the marked increase in membership of some conservative denominations, in contrast with the general decline of English Protestantism, 'was not due to mass evangelism but because conservative Protestantism had been more successful in nurturing children in a belief system which proved to be well-designed for transmission to children' (245 f.). It would appear that neither the liberal's Christianity-is-an-adult-religion stance, nor the conservative evangelical's insistence that you-must-be-a-twice-born-believer, can be used as excuses for ignoring the profoundly influential role of the Christian nurture/formation of children for the survival of the Christian religion. However, Hyde's remaining two chapters on adolescent (and student) religious belief, behaviour and values remind us that such formative Christian education is not as long-lasting in its effect, nor as widely experienced, as some religionists would hope. What general comments can be made about a wide-ranging survey? Its strength is also its weakness: in considering so many pieces of research each one is inevitably dealt with rather briefly. Every chapter could be expanded to make a substantial book in itself. Sometimes the brevity of this treatment can lead to a superficial treatment, an ambiguous summary, or worse. Even the most expert, however, will find this a valuable work to possess precisely because of the range of the survey. Certainly those who are less expert will be very grateful to Hyde for distilling the experts' liquor so that it fits into a manageable container, albeit in the form of a rather concentrated and potent cocktail. Fundamental research is not done solely so that the researchers can keep their jobs. The researcher also provides other people with a leg up so that they can adopt a clearer view for themselves. But the final responsibility of discerning the wood from the trees remains our own. One last point: psychological study at its best - and, indeed, at its worst - cross connects with philosophical, and in the case of the psychology of religion theological, reflection. Hyde occasionally refers to some of this non-empirical analysis and speculation; understandably enough he is much more selective here than in his survey of empirical studies. Regrettably he does not always signal as clearly as he might the non-empirical status of these references, nor does he always draw out their relevance to the empirical work. But it is a tribute to the breadth of his interest and reading that they are mentioned at all. Some books on psychology of religion ignore this literature altogether. Its presence here leaves this particular reader wanting more help in connecting the empirical researnh with what a certain professor of theology, innocent of any offence he might cause, used to distinguish as 'thinking research'. In addition to its other virtues, Hyde's book could be seen as a most opportune challenge to both the theologian (particularly the philosophical theologian) and the psychologist of religion to attempt the even harder task of learning about each other's work and fitting it together.
