I contrast parallelist and sociological perspective on mysticism, physics, and the relations between physics and mysticism, and sketch the societal and historical contexts of parallelist and anti- parallelist arguments. Parallelists, I argue, use the ideas of physics and mysticism as cultural resources in their struggle to organize, preserve, or advance their interests. The paper concludes with a bibliographical essay on the major issues and problems involved in studying the complex relationships between physics and mysticism. Parallels and Paradoxes in Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism: 11 - A Sociological Perspective on Parallelism Sal Restivo In the first part of this paper, I pointed out pitfalls in the argument that there are significant parallels, analogies, and convergences bet- ween modern physics and ancient mysticism. I In this sequel, I will try to show the plausibility of viewing this argument, or 'parallelism', as a strategy in intellectual conflict.2 Parallelists, ac- cording to this conflict perspective, use the ideas of 'modern physics' and 'ancient mysticism' as cultural resources in their strug- gle to organize, preserve, or advance their interests.3 The ideas of physics and mysticism are used differently by opponents of parallelism, and differently again by people who are not explicitly Social Studies of Science (SAGE, London and Beverly Hills), Vol. 12 (1982), 37-71</page><page sequence="2">38 Social Studies of Science aligned against the parallelists but who hold opposing views.4 I shall also expand the critique of parallelism in Part I by showing how the phenomena of physics and mysticism which parallelists discuss can be accounted for sociologically. 'Physics-mysticism parallelism'a refers to the two-fold argument, following Fritjof Capra's formulation, that (1) 'a consistent view of the world is beginning to emerge from modern physics which is harmonious with Eastern wisdom', and (2) 'Eastern mysticism pro- vides a consistent and beautiful philosophical framework which can accommodate our most advanced theories of the physical world'.5 A more general form of parallelism in which contem- porary knowledge is viewed as a rediscovery of ancient knowledge is a recurring strategy in the history of intellectual conflict and change. A detailed analysis of the socio-historical aspects of parallelism is beyond the scope of this paper. However, in order to illustrate the recurrence of the parallelist strategy, I briefly discuss parallelism in the Renaissance and in Weimar Germany in the Bibliographical Essay. C The major programmatic statement on contemporary physics- mysticism parallelism is Capra's The Tao of Physics. This book continues to be the focus of my analysis, as it was in Part 1.6 Ideas as Cultural Resources 'Interests' are aims which are pursued by competing groups in the struggle for material and symbolic resources which group members perceive as necessary for group survival, and for gaining advan- tages in relative power, privilege, and prestige.7 Barnes and others have helped sensitize sociologists of knowledge and science to the ways in which ideas are employed as cultural resources to further individual and collective interests. Ideas, write Barnes and Shapin, 'have no inherent properties whatsoever, and have features im- puted to them entirely according to their mode of use'.8 The 'in- terests thesis' is illustrated by the different ways in which parallelists, anti-parallelists, and non-parallelists treat the ideas of modern physics and ancient mysticism. Interests can be analyzed on many psychological and sociological levels. I shall focus on in- terests expressed in written media. a.

See note 1.</page><page sequence="3">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 39 Parallelists are interested in preserving and advancing an image of science as a liberating mode of thought. For example, Capra, a physicist, presents parallelism as a defence of science against the threat of anti-science movements.9 He explicitly identifies his aim in The Tao of Physics as 'improving the image of science' among young people who have turned away from science and toward 'Eastern ways of liberation'. '0 He also wants to share the 'beauty' of physics as he has experienced it. Capra's aims are echoed in Gary Zukav's The Dancing Wu Li Masters. Zukav is not a physicist. He describes himself as a person with 'a liberal arts mentality'. Zukav claims that he has discovered that physical concepts are fundamentally 'quite simple'. He listen- ed to physicists and discovered that (1) he could 'understand' them, and (2) their discussions sounded like 'theological' discussions. His aim is to translate quantum physics and relativity theory for people who do not have 'a scientific mental set' so that they can 'under- stand the extraordinary process which is occurring in theoretical physics'. The 'extraordinary process' refers to Capra's thesis that modern physics is converging toward ancient mysticism. Zukav asserts, for example, that 'the languages of eastern mystics and western physicists are becoming very similar'. I The same physical ideas discussed by Capra and Zukav have been 'popularized' without imputing mystical attributes to them. For example, physicist Gerald Feinberg discusses quantum mechanics and relativity theory in non-mystical terms. His audience is not mystically-oriented young people, but the 'general public'. Feinberg, like Capra and Zukav, is interested in conveying a positive image of science to non-scientists. He wrote his book, What is the World Made Of?, he notes, for two reasons. One is that he wants to share the 'profoundly beautiful' discoveries of physics with 'as many people as possible'. Feinberg thus echoes Capra and Zukav. His second aim is to justify the funds that the United States and other governments have provided for physics research over the past thirty years. He explains why the research was undertaken and what the outcomes were on the assumption that the funds were well-spent. But Feinberg does not impute 'mystical' features to the ideas of modern physics. Indeed, whereas Capra and Zukav stress the radical incommensurability of modern physics and classical physics (that is, that modern physics breaks with classical physics and returns to ancient mystical ideas), Feinberg underscores the continuities and overlaps between modern and classical physics. 12</page><page sequence="4">40 Social Studies of Science Capra argues that 'paradoxes' are intrinsic to atomic physics, and compares tham to Zen koans. One of the major 'paradoxes' Capra and Zukav discuss is 'wave-particle duality'.'3 Feinberg, by contrast, does not mention wave-particle duality, and indeed makes no references to paradoxes in physics. It is interesting to compare Capra's views on modern physics and ancient mysticism with the views of another spiritually-minded physicist, G.A. Shook. In contrast to Capra, Shook argues that (1) scientists in general do not consider the mystical experience 'knowledge', (2) neither scientists nor mystics can give us know- ledge of the 'underlying reality of nature', (3) 'true' mysticism is part of but not the same as religion, and (4) mysticism is elitist and esoteric, and cannot contribute to solving our social problems. All that the mystic 'knows', Shook contends, is that he/she has had 'an extraordinary experience'. Shook is generally critical of mysticism, and makes no claims about mystics anticipating modern physicists. His position reflects his interest in defending the Baha'i perspective on the central role of the Prophet as the vessel of God's revelations, and the 'true religiousness' of Baha'is. '4 These differences between Capra and Feinberg, and Capra and Shook, illustrate the thesis that the attributes of ideas are imputed to them and are not inherent in them. In the following sections, I want to examine how parallelists use the ideas of modern physics and ancient mysticism, and contrast their perspective with a sociological view of physics and mysticism. Mysticism: Parallelist and Sociological Perspectivesb Parallelists view mysticism as a mode of thought that allows us to experience reality 'directly'. They accept the mystical experience in and for itself. For example, Capra contends that Eastern mystics have always realized 'that reality transcends ordinary language'. He quotes Ananda Coomaraswamy in support of the idea that the mythical language used by mystics 'embodies the nearest approach to absolute truth that can be stated in words'.15 Parallelists stress the profundity, purity, and perfection of mystical knowledge. In effect, they immunize mysticism against the methods and theories of critical inquiry. Thus, Capra argues that 'mysticism is, above all, an experience that cannot be learned from books'. More generally, parallelists (1) underscore the mystery of</page><page sequence="5">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 41 the similarities in reports about mystical experiences by people who in some cases have had no contact with one another, and (2) overlook the variety in mystical experiences. Capra views Eastern mysticism as 'a vast number of subtly interwoven spiritual disciplines and philosophical systems'; but he asserts that the basic features of the world views in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism are the same. Furthermore, the 'universal' experiences of mystics are, according to Capra, basically religious; mysticism and religion are inseparable. 16 The parallelist conception of mysticism is an extension of the mystification, glorification, and worship of mystery by such mystics-scholars as E. Underhill, D.T. Suzuki, C. Humphreys, and R. Jones. Arguments in defence of, and descriptions of, mystical experiences are offered with varying degrees of missionary zeal. Suzuki is exemplary in this respect; and this is of special significance because of his pre-eminence as an interpreter of Budd- hism (especially Zen) in lay and scholarly circles. Suzuki stresses the notion that the uniqueness of Zen 'lies in its irrationality or its pass- ing beyond our logical comprehension'. His views on mysticism are widely quoted throughout Capra's book.17 From a sociological perspective, mysticism is a social phen- omenon. In general, the sociologist is interested in explaining the social roots of mysticism, and the effects of mysticism on society. There is no general sociological theory of mysticism. However, the sociological literature on mysticism and religion is a source of ex- amples and working hypotheses which contrast with the parallelist perspective, and constitute a sociological critique of the parallelist portrayal of mysticism. Whereas parallelists assert that the 'complexities', 'wholism', and 'gigantic numbers' of Hindu cosmology are evidence that the ancients anticipated modern physicists, sociologists attempt to link the characteristics of Hindu cosmology to the sociocultural milieu of ancient India. For example, the 'gigantic numbers' of Hindu cosmology are not anticipations of the large numbers used in modern cosmology. They are primarily numerological as opposed to mathematical phenomena. Mnemonic requirements in the Brahmanic oral tradition stimulated number schematization; and plays on numbers were widely used along with versification and rhyme. Gigantic numbers were also designed to simulate sym- bolically the godly realms.18 The rhetoric of mysticism which parallelists accept uncritically</page><page sequence="6">42 Social Studies of Science can also be related to social structure. For example, it is possible to identify relationships between the rhetoric of Hindu religion and mysticism and India's social structure without assuming a vulgar positivistic view of religion as a description of the social order. 19 The imagery in Louis Dumont's discussion of the Indian caste system evokes distinct images of wholism and interpenetration. For example, the hereditary groups which make up castes are distinguished from one another and connected by (1) hierarchy, (2) rules of separation, and (3) a division of labour; all three aspects of caste, according to Dumont, 'are given together', they are all 'one'. The 'oneness' of the complex interconnections of caste suggests the 'oneness' of the mystical experience. And the mystical conception of 'interpenetration' is suggested in Dumont's description of the set of castes in a given territory as a 'geographically circumscribed system', his portrait of the intricate intercaste network of interdependent specializations (jajmani), and his discussion of the prestations and counter-prestations which tie castes together. Given my argument in Part I, caution must be exer- cized in relating mystical imagery and imagery in descriptions of social structure. Still, Dumont's work suggests the working hypothesis that the rhetoric of wholism and interpenetration that parallelists interpret in terms of bootstrap physics is grounded in the relative lack of institutional differentiation and autonomy in traditional societies and, in the case of India, the persistence of kin- ship and religious bonds under conditions of increasing aggregative complexity in the social structure. Aggregative complexity is the result of 'piling' elements one upon another in a random or ar- bitrary manner (as opposed to complexity based on, for example, a rational or logical ordering, or a progressive development such as evolution). The aggregative nature of ancient Indian social struc- ture is noted in various descriptions of Hinduism and the caste system.20 Finally, parallelists ignore the politics of mysticism. Very little research has been done on this aspect of mysticism. However, Col- lins's study of the occult and mystical traditions offers evidence that mystics throughout history and in various cultures have struggled among themselves and with other intellectuals for privilege, wealth, and prestige. They have manipulated ideas in order to further in- terests - that is, they have used ideas as resources in struggles for power.21 Furthermore, Schutz, Horton, and to a certain extent Kuhn have alerted us to the ways which have been developed to ac-</page><page sequence="7">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 43 count for failures and errors in science and religion, and in physics and mysticism. Each of these realms of knowledge possesses a cer- tain degree of 'conceptual resiliency' which immunizes it against external criticism. The power and success of their cognitive defence systems, however, depend on social factors which are less secure from attack by rival systems. Nowotny identifies two groups of such factors: (1) those which safeguard the system and demarcate it, and (2) those 'general socio-economic changes which affect the broad structure of risk'.22 What do parallelists gain by asserting that mysticism is a homogeneous phenomenon, a way of experiencing reality directly, and an experience that transcends sociological analysis? Capra con- tends that those young people who are turning to Eastern ways of liberation and whom he wants to reach have a marked anti- scientific attitude. Given his interest in improving the image of science among these young people, the best strategy for ac- complishing this would appear to be one that brings science closer to mysticism and simultaneously exempts mysticism from scientific analysis - that is, that protects it from the very rationality youth are supposed to be rejecting. First, Capra divorces modern physics from technology. Technology is the 'true' source of the evils which young people have mistakenly blamed on science, and on modern physics in par- ticular. Then, he mystifies physics. These two steps - de- technologizing and mystifying - are the basis for Capra's argu- ment that physics 'can be a path with a heart, a way to spiritual knowledge and self-realization'. Insofar as physics is mystical it is (given Capra's view of mysticism) immune to scientific methods and theories. Capra tries to resolve this paradox by adopting a 'complementary' perspective: 'science and mysticism are two com- plementary manifestations of the human mind; of its rational and intuitive faculties'. Zukav adopts the same solution when he writes that 'the practice of Tantra does not mean the end of rational throught'. But if the people Capra and Zukav are trying to com- municate with have rejected rational thought or feel alienated from it why should they accept this paradoxical resolution? Perhaps, in the end, by titling his last chapter 'The End of Science', Zukav offers those alienated from science and rationality a stronger message than Capra does by arguing for complementarity.23 But neither Capra nor Zukav is in fact prepared to sacrifice science and ra- tionality in the interest of appealing to anti-rational sentiments.</page><page sequence="8">44 Social Studies of Science This should not be surprising once we recognize that Capra and Zukav are writing on behalf of 'rational science'. Physics: Parallelist and Sociological Perspectivesc Capra argues that a 'deeper understanding' of the mystical tradi- tions he writes about 'can only be felt when one decides to become actively involved' in them; mysticism 'cannot be learned from books'.24 He implies that (1) physics can be learned from books, and (2) a 'deeper understanding' of physics can also be learned from books without becoming actively involved in it. Parallelists claim that physics can be communicated to non- scientists without using mathematics or technical language, and without getting them involved in doing physics. Zukav argues that 'physics is not mathematics': 'Stripped of mathematics, physics becomes pure enchantment.' He disputes the idea that learning mathematics is a prerequisite for learning subatomic physics, and seeks support for this view from physicist David Finkelstein. Finkelstein, according to Zukav, contends that it is not necessary to learn mathematics in order to learn subatomic physics. He quotes and paraphrases Finkelstein as follows: Mathematics, like English, also is a language. It is constructed of symbols. 'The best you can get with symbols is a maximal but incomplete description.' A mathematical analysis of subatomic phenomena is no better qualitatively than any other symbolic analysis, because symbols do not follow the same rules as ex- perience. They follow rules of their own. In short, the problem is not in the language, the problem is the language. But these remarks do not answer the question of whether one has to learn mathematics in order to learn subatomic physics. Zukav's aim - and this is true of parallelists generally - is somehow to make physics palatable to people who are intimidated by, ignorant of, or opposed for one reason or another to mathematical language. Indeed, he asserts that most physical ideas are 'essential- ly simple'.25 Is mathematics an inherent feature of modern physics? The parallelists say 'no', since their goal is to persuade people who do not have mathematical backgrounds that they can understand physics. But physicist Gerald Feinberg has a slightly different view-</page><page sequence="9">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 45 point. He argues that 'a substantial comprehension of modern physics can be obtained without advanced mathematical training'. In his book, he assumes that his readers have had a 'typical secon- dary school course' in mathematics. He also notes, however, that 'sophisticated mathematics' is essential to theoretical discovery and the practical application of physical theories.26 Physicist Richard Feynman takes the stronger position that the laws of nature cannot be communicated to persons who are ignorant of mathematics.27 The features imputed to physics by sociologists contrast with the parallelist treatment of physics. The rationale for viewing physics as a social phenomenon is firmly grounded in the works of sociologists of science. These range from Merton's early statements on the dynamic interdependence of science and society to more recent formulations about (1) the interaction between the social structure of science and the 'larger structure' of society, and (2) the influence of the sociocultural milieu of a science on the values, beliefs, and ideologies in its disciplinary matrix.28 There are a number of exemplary case studies in the sociology of physics. Frankel's study of corpuscular optics and the wave theory of light in early nineteenth-century France shows that scientists' percep- tions of intellectual factors such as diffraction were influenced by social factors.29 In his study of physics and psychics in late Vic- torian England, Wynne shows how 'the social contexts of use' in- fluenced the development of late Victorian physics.30 And Forman defends in persuasive detail the argument that German physicists accommodated their science to a hostile sociocultural milieu. His thesis on ideological accommodation is applicable (with the addi- tions I have made in brackets) to parallelism: 'scientists [and their supporters from outside the scientific community] will take measures to counter a [perceived] decline in prestige aimed at alter- ing the public image of science to make it consonant with altered public values; this will, however, alter scientific values and ideology, and even doctrinal foundations.'31 It is not clear whether parallelism has begun to influence values, ideology, or doctrinal foundations in physics. It is interesting to note, however, that David Bohm's recent work in quantum physics has been labeled 'mystical'. Bohm is not, strictly speaking, a parallelist, but he is sympathetic to at least some aspects of parallelist thought. His work has been strongly influenced by his friendship with Krishna- murti, and this may be a source of what some people interpret as a</page><page sequence="10">46 Social Studies of Science 'mystical' or more broadly 'spiritual' dimension in Bohm's physics. 32 In recent years, a number of studies have significantly advanced our understanding of the social nature of science and scientific knowledge. Woolgar's study of pulsar research indicates that scien- tists and the sociologists who study their activities interpret discovery accounts in different ways. Some, for example, see them as consistent, while others see them as contradictory. The Latour and Woolgar study of a biological research laboratory is a carefully documented account of the social construction of scientific facts. Harvey has drawn attention to how physicists self-consciously and confidently use non-empirical criteria in evaluating knowledge- claims. Collins, Pinch, and others have also contributed to the rapidly accumulating literature on the contextual, contingent, and constructivist nature of scientific facts and theories.33 The general conclusion to be drawn from a review of social studies of science is that active scientific fields are heterogeneous arenas of disputes, struggles to achieve and establish priority, and conflicts about theoretical, methodological, and substantive issues. Scientists have different interests and are active in different social milieux. The interaction of these differences influences the con- struction and use of ideas and facts in science. This does not necessarily mean that there are not areas of consensus in science. However, the parallelists' stress on the consistency of modern physics ignores areas of conflict, and the potential for theoretical, methodological, and substantive changes. Thus, Capra refers to 'a consistent view of the world' emerging in modern physics; he con- tends that the concepts of modern physics 'all seem to lead in the same direction', and that quantum theory and relativity theory both force us to see the world the same way - that is, 'very much in the way a Hindu, Buddhist or Taoist sees it'. He stresses the 'precision' and 'sophistication' of modern experiments, and the 'rigorous' and 'consistent' mathematical formalism of modern physics.34 The parallelist argument depends on the various aspects of modern physics converging with each other, on modern physics as a whole developing in a certain direction, and on this develop- ment retaining its alleged mystical features indefinitely. All of these notions are at odds with the sociological portrait of science in general, and physics in particular (as I indicated in Part I). What advantages can parallelists gain from portraying modern physics as an essentially 'simple' (Zukav) homogeneous phen-</page><page sequence="11">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 47 omenon which can be understood in non-mathematical, non- technical terms, and which is moving unhampered toward the world view of ancient mysticism? Parallelists assume that the simpler, more consistent, more homogeneous, and more stable the ideas of physics are made to appear, the more appealing they will be to people who are disenchanted with science. Moreover, in order to get physics and mysticism to correspond, they seem obliged to sustain the mysteries of mysticism while they simultaneously 'simplify' physics. This simplification has to be carried out in such a way that physics can be (paradoxically) communicable to lay peo- ple but 'mysterious'; or at least open to 'intuitive' understanding. This aspect of parallelism is illustrated by Zukav's remark that physics stripped of mathematics becomes 'pure enchantment'. The ideas of modern physics and ancient mysticism are cultural resources which are used in different social contexts to serve dif- ferent individual and collective interests. Parallelists impute mean- ings to physics and mysticism which in their view will make physics appealing to people who are untutored in science, and to people who, tutored in science or not, have turned away from science toward ancient (and especially Eastern) mysticism. Parallelists are interested in preserving or advancing what they perceive to be the interests of a scientific community threatened by challenges to its integrity, autonomy, and power. Anti-Parallelism Contemporary parallelism is a reaction and an alternative to counter-culture critiques of science, as well as to anti-science, anti- religion, and anti-mystical sympathies and movements. It is in turn the target of anti-parallelists. Isaac Asimov's anti-parallelist essays are signs of the struggle that is developing in the competition for public sympathies and resources among parallelists and anti- parallelists. Asimov argues that the conclusions reached by scientists are bas- ed on observation and measurement and cannot be equated with quotations from Eastern, Celtic, African, or Greek folklore, mythology, and philosophy.35 He specifically opposes Capra's arguments in The Tao of Physics. Asimov's general argument is that there are only three things that may be happening to the universe in the long run: (a) it may be un-</page><page sequence="12">48 Social Studies of Science changing (that is, there is no 'beginning' and no 'end'), (b) it may be changing in one direction (that is, there is a distinct beginning, and a different ending), or (c) it may be changing cyclically: All the sages who have speculated on the universe intuitively must come up with one of these three alternatives. And, all things being equal, there is a one-in-three chance of their having duplicated whatever conclusions science eventually comes to on the subject.36 His reply to Capra is that if the Eastern sages know as much about the universe as physicists do, why not turn to a reading of the Taoist texts to discover the unanswered questions of modern physics? Of course, Asimov argues, such a strategy would be futile. But then, if ancient texts can be 'properly understood' only after physicists have reached their conclusions, what scientific value do the ancient texts have? What nonsense all this supposed intuitional truth is, and how comic is the sight of the genuflections made to it by rational minds who lost their nerve. No, it isn't really comic; it's tragic. There has been at least one other occasion in history when Greek secular and rational thought bowed to the mystical aspects of Christianity, and what followed was a Dark Age. We can't afford another.37 Asimov defends the idea of science as a rational enterprise, standing alone among all modes of thought on account of its uni- que methodology. He does not deny the role of intuition in science; but the truth or falsity of a conclusion in science must ultimately be decided by reason and reason alone. Asimov stresses deduction and induction from observations and measurements, replication, and consensus as the hallmarks of science. He stands opposed not only to parallelism but to all perspectives (including by implication social studies of science) which challenge his conception of science as pure reason and unadulterated objectivity. Thus, he defends the very aspects of science which Capra's 'counter-culture youth' have rebelled against.38 There is a softer argument against parallelism based on the no- tion that ancient sciences should be studied in terms of their sociocultural contexts and not in terms of their relationship to the development of modern science. The ancient sciences might be rele- vant in some way to our current situation, but this is a matter for study and not something to be taken for granted. The argument is</page><page sequence="13">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 49 generally applicable to modes of thought, and allows for the possibility that the original meanings of the mystical traditions might be useful in dealing with current issues and problems in science and society. 39 Stegmuller offers an implicit critique of parallelism in consider- ing whether Newton himself could have formulated his theory a thousand years earlier, let alone someone who lived a thousand years before Newton. He argues that given nothing but his genius as a physicist and mathematician, Newton could not have done so. The reason Stegmuller gives is that a theory requires special preliminary work (in this case, the work of Kepler and Galileo, for example), and centuries of transforming qualitative phenomena into quantitative data. This implies that Newton's theory could not have been arrived at through some sort of revelation that bypassed the groundwork.40 This argument is vulnerable, however, to the ex- tent that it rests on the notion that knowledge develops linearly and in an invariant sequence. The defence of science in the face of actual or potential threats to its lofty position in the industrialized and industrializing nation- states is sometimes aligned against anti-science movements and the rise of religious consciousness movements. These two movements are linked in the works of Theodore Roszak. His arguments are not always a matter of simply setting up opposing camps. In one place, for example, he argues that the mystic has accepted 'the fullness of human experience', and has therefore been 'more truly scientific than the conventional scientist'. It was science as an intellectual ac- tivity, however, that was the object of the counter-culture offensive Roszak helped to articulate.The validation of the improvizations of Kerouac and Ginsberg, irrespective of their artistic value, tells us, according to Roszak, something about a generation seeking creativity in an 'art unmediated by intellect'.41 The contrast between Capra and Roszak illustrates the important point that the critique of mechanistic or materialist science can have at least two consequences. In the case of Capra, the alter- native to mechanism is a complementary relation between 'new physics' or 'wholistic science' and mysticism. For Roszak, the alter- native is a 'new Gnosis'. In both cases, however, ancient wisdom is resurrected. Finally, there is some evidence of internal conflict among the parallelists. W.I. Thompson, for example, believes that physics and mysticism are compatible. But he is suspicious of the type of</page><page sequence="14">50 Social Studies of Science parallelism being worked out in the collaboration between Gopi Krishna and Carl von Weizsacker. Thompson is worried about the emergence of a 'Knowledge business run by an elite corps of mystics and physicists'.42 He might be equally wary of the somewhat looser relationship between Capra and Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan, head of the Sufi Order in the West, and the relationship be- tween Bohm and Krishnamurti. The internal and external conflicts parallelists are engaged in can be understood as part of the struggle between scientists and other intellectuals for societal resources. More broadly, they can be view- ed as part of the struggle for power among individuals, groups, and classes. The emerging dialogue between parallelists and anti- parallelists, and conflicts among parallelists, reflect a potential for new struggles, and new forms of super- and sub-ordination in the intellectual community and in the wider society. In the following section, I want briefly to explore the societal context within which contemporary parallelism has emerged, and suggest an interpretation of parallelism somewhat broader than that I have sketched to this point. The Societal Context of Parallelismd In her study of the transition from high scholasticism to modern science, Frances Yates hypothesizes that the 'Scientific Revolution' occurred in two stages. The first stage, she argues, was rooted in the idea of an animistic, magically operated universe; the second stage was rooted in the idea of a mathematical, mechanically operated universe.43 The 'retreat from reason' in stage one was, according to the Yates hypothesis, a response to the stifling effects of a rigidified system of thought, and a necessary condition for the breakthroughs of stage two. Yates's hypothesis has been formulated in a more general form by Mary Douglas: she follows Kant in argu- ing that 'thought can only advance by freeing itself from the shackles of its own subjective conditions'.44 The Yates-Douglas hypothesis suggests that contemporary parallelism is a reaction to perceived closure (loss of adaptability) in modern science, or ra- tionality. This hypothesis has been proposed by a number of con- temporary scholars, including J.M. Yinger and E. Tiryakian. Yinger, in his 1977 Presidential address to the American Sociological Association, argued that we are experiencing a planet-</page><page sequence="15">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 51 wide civilization transformation. Under such conditions, he said, it is important for sociologists to undertake intensive studies of counter-cultures. They can be conceived as 'art forms'; and from 'the sublime to the ugly', as 'voices crying in the wilderness' or symptoms of disorder and as 'unintended warnings and illustra- tions' of the future, they 'highlight, dramatize and anticipate drastic problems'. The link to the theme of this paper is Yinger's remark that today's counter-cultures seek truth through mystical insight. As an attack on the intellectual establishment, this is not new. In the fifteenth century, it was Taborites versus Prague University masters; in nineteenth-century England, it was sec- tarians denouncing the clergy's monopoly on truth. Today, science seems to be implicated in all of the difficult problems we are facing. Some people see a need for alternatives to a science-and- technology which has become 'too obvious', one-dimensional, and directed toward an apparent evolutionary dead end. Yinger describes the situation as a 'symbol-less' one, a situation that recurs periodically in history. It is no accident that in seeking to adapt to such a situation, some people turn to mysticism.45 Tiryakian, like Yinger, emphasizes the importance of counter- cultures as forces for social change; but he is more forceful in his treatment of esoteric culture 'as a source of ideational innovation in Western modernization'. 'Esoteric' is defined as 'those religiophilosophic belief systems which underlie occult techniques and practices: that is, it refers to the more comprehensive cognitive mappings of nature and the cosmos, the epistemological and on- tological reflections of ultimate reality, which mappings constitute a stock of knowledge that provides the ground for occult pro- cedure.' Tiryakian argues that 'esoteric influences in the form of symbolism, imagery, practices, and cosmologies have been in much of the background of the rise of the scientific disciplines'. He iden- tifies Paracelsus as the key mediator between esoteric culture and modern science. Tiryakian's general conclusion is that esoteric culture is a 'religious retreat'. This 'withdrawal' - this 'sleep of the senses' - is a reaction by individuals and groups to failures in established symbols and cognitive models. Tiryakian joins other prophets of a new cultural synthesis when he describes the occult revival as part of a new international 'cultural matrix'.46 Charles Singer has described scientific episodes in which the 'speculative attitude' is productive.47 Everett Mendelsohn, similar- ly, points out that such episodes are associated with the breakdown</page><page sequence="16">52 Social Studies of Science of traditional patterns of authority, dogma and consensus. Like Singer, he notes that such periods are important because they allow new areas to be explored; but they can amplify and exaggerate problems and concepts.48 This suggests the hypothesis that a loosening of canons of rigour is necessary, occasionally, to get science (or, more generally, inquiry) out of the inevitable ruts it falls into. Wallis's (1616-1703) 'bold use of infinitesimals' is cited by Bloor as an example of 'the value of the decline of rigour'.49 The Yates-Douglas hypothesis establishes a context within which the interests of parallelists, anti-, and non-parallelists take on a broader significance. Parallelism, like other strategies in intellec- tual conflict, ebbs and flows as history unfolds. Its contemporary visibility, following Yates and Douglas, reflects the perceived vitali- ty of claims about the loss of adaptive potential in science and ra- tionality. K. Boulding and M. Wartofsky, for example, argue that science and rationality are getting into ecological and evolutionary 'ruts'. Parallelism is one reflection of the attempts underway to answer claims such as those made by Boulding and Wartofsky; these attempts are aimed at re-establishing the potency of reason in human affairs.50 The other aspect of this picture is that a perceived or actual decline in the power of science and scientists is a stimulus to groups interested in taking over science's niche in society. If ours is a time, to borrow Langdon Winner's phrase, of 'technics-out-of-control', perhaps we should expect a sense of powerlessness to develop and to be reflected in a resurgence of in- terest in 'the irrational'.5' Following Bourguignon's suggestion, we can suppose that all societies must regulate the relations between the rational and the irrational. Where control of technological, economic, and social factors appears to be in hand, we should ex- pect little support for the irrational; where control appears to be waning, we should expect a resurgence of the irrational or what some scholars describe as a 'romantic reaction'.52 Perhaps we are witnessing 'a swing of the pendulum'. Weiman, writing in the mid-1920s, conceived intellectual history as a pendulum swinging between mysticism and scientific method, and going through a 'midpoint of contemplation' (contemplation culminating in the 'discernment of God'). This sort of imagery is also found in the conception of scientific change as the product of a continuing con- flict among three fundamental world views: mechanistic! materialistic, organic and magic/mystical. In the early seventeenth century, the struggle engaged mechanists, Aristotelians, and</page><page sequence="17">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 53 alchemists. Later examples of this basic struggle encompass Berkeley's critique of scientific dogmatism, Rousseau's opposition to the Newtonian orthodoxy of d'Alembert and Condorcet, and the criticism of material science from Crookes to Max Born, P. Kapit- sa, Capra, and Roszak.53 Conclusion The parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism are in part the product of uncritical comparisons between symbol systems separated in time and space. From a sociological perspective, they reflect a failure (1) to distinguish between numerological and mathematical motives, systems, and activities, and (2) to differen- tiate aggregated complexity from developmental complexity. Parallelist arguments rest on mystified versions of mysticism, and truncated models of physics (and science) as a social activity and process. This is related to the tendency in parallelism to draw together the mythical worlds of the mystic who experiences 'pure consciousness', and the scientist who experiences 'pure knowledge' (for example, Platonic truths). Parallelism is a recurring phenomenon in struggles for power within intellectual communities and between intellectual and other communities. It is an ideology rooted in three basic strategies. One is expressed in the Forman hypothesis - that scientists will take measures to counter a decline in prestige aimed at altering the public image of science to make it consonant with altered public values; this will alter scientific values, ideologies, and doctrinal founda- tions.54 The second strategy is: the prevailing and most prestigious modes of knowing in a society will be exploited by advocates of other modes to legitimate and add prestige to their modes; they will exploit the prevailing modes by 'adopting' their methods and rhetoric. In the Transcendental Meditation movement, for exam- ple, experiments, modern technologies, statistical methods, and mathematical models are used to 'validate' the experiences of 'pure consciousness'. Baha'is cite their prophet, Baha'u'll'ah: religion is the 'science of the love of God'.55 And parallelists and others (for example, theologians) argue for parallels, analogies, convergences, and complementarities between science and mysticism or religion. Another strategy is somehow to subordinate the prevailing mode, as in the subordination of science to Vedic</page><page sequence="18">54 Social Studies of Science cognition in the TM movement. These strategies are not, at least in some of their manifestations and consequences, necessarily im- pediments to scientific growth and change. The Yates-Douglas hypothesis suggests that parallelism is in part a reaction to what some people perceive as 'the failure of modern science in its claim to universal rationality.'56 More generally, this failure can be view- ed, in Weberian terms, as a consequence of the rationalization of rationality. The Yates-Douglas hypothesis does not have to be based on a belief in scientific progress, the subordination of irrational to rational modes of thought, or the monopolization of 'truth' and 'ob- jectivity' by 'scientists'. It can be conceived as referring to a general process in which adaptations (strategies) reach their limits as guarantors of survival and development, and new and old adapta- tions are 'experimented' with in the search for new adaptations. The experimental period can lead to failure and extinction, or the development of more or less successful strategies. These new strategies will 'work' (for the species, or for particular groups and classes) for varying lengths of time. Thus, parallelism can be understood as both a strategy in the struggle for power and privilege among intellectuals, and as an attempt to work out new modes of thinking and behaviour in response to problems of sustenance and growth in human communities. * NO TES I gratefully acknowledge the criticisms, suggestions, and assistance I received while preparing this paper for publication from Randall Collins, Daryl Chubin, several anonymous referees, and especially David Edge. 1.

In Part I, I introduced the word 'parallelism' as an abbreviation for the thesis that there are parallels between ancient and modern knowledge. The word has other meanings. For example, it is the name for the thesis that mind and matter corres- pond; it is used in the literature on Euclid's parallel postulate; and it is used in a general sense elsewhere: for example, T.

See note 4 on 'adumbrationism'. 3. I am grateful to David Edge for helping me to formulate my argument in these terms. See also the editors' remarks in B. Barnes and S. Shapin (eds), Natural Order (London and Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage, 1979), 188. 4. See the discussion in R.K. Merton, 'On the History and Systematics of Sociological Theory', in Merton, Social Theory and Social Structure (New York: The Free Press, enlarged edn., 1968), 21-23, on adumbrationism. Merton speculates on some of the motives behind '. . . the dedicated, deliberate search for all manner of earlier versions of scientific or scholarly ideas. At the extreme, the adumbrationist describes the faintest shadow of resemblance between earlier and later ideas as vir- tual identity'. However, adumbrationism refers specifically to 'the denigrating of new ideas by pretending to find them old:' Merton, The Sociology of Science (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1973), 350. Parallelism, by contrast, aims at upgrading new ideas by associating them with old ideas. Merton's specula- tions on adumbrationism are not, therefore, helpful either as starting points or foils for a sociology of parallelism. However, they are relevant to the more general prob- lem of the social roots and consequences of relating old and new modes of thought; see the discussion at the end of section a in the Bibliographical Essay. 5. F. Capra, The Tao of Physics (Berkeley, Calif.: Shambhala Publications, 1975, reprinted London: Collins/Fontana paperback, 1976), 12. 6. Capra lectures widely and writes for a variety of publications; his book con- tinues to attract the attention of scholars and laypersons alike. 7. See the discussions on 'interests' in B. Barnes, Interests and the Growth of Knowledge (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1977), 10-19, 81; and S. Shapin, 'Homo Phrenologicus: Anthropological Perspectives on an Historical Problem', in Barnes and Shapin (eds), op. cit., note 3, 43-50; cf. J. Habermas, Knowledge and Human Interests (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 1971), 196-212, 308-14. It should be noted that Barnes and Shapin argue for a 'strong' version of the interests thesis. It is possible, however, to conceive of a 'weaker' version in which the social conditions under which ideas are originally constructed builds in some interpretive constraints; in this sense, there are no 'pure' or 'neutral' ideas - all ideas, in one way or another and to different degrees, have built in 'predispositions' and constraints which affect imputation. I am sympathetic to the argument in S. Woolgar, 'Interests and Ex- planation in the Social Study of Science,' Social Studies of Science, Vol. 11, No. 3 (August 1981), 365-94, at 388-89, that sociologists of science should practice 'a high degree of methodological reflection, as a first step in understanding the practical management of the many kinds of "philosophical difficulty" inherent in explana- tion'. He addresses himself in particular to the 'interests' thesis. My own aim in drawing on the interests thesis is to suggest an explanatory perspective, not to offer a systematic, reflective explanatory account of parallelism. In defence of proponents of the interests thesis, it should be noted that 'methodological reflection' is often a barrier to conceptual innovation. On the other hand, the lack of reflection Woolgar notes perhaps explains why sociologists of science have failed to recognize that Marx- ists have had some experience with an interests thesis and may have some insights (based on practice and reflection) on issues such as those Woolgar raises. I must also point out, in answer to an anonymous referee, that my arguments and rhetoric do indeed reflect my interests as an advocate of a sociological approach to parallelism. So I do - as suggested by the referee - enter into the parallelist debate; not,</page><page sequence="20">56 Social Studies of Science however, as an alternative to analyzing parallelism in a 'pure' way, but rather by vir- tue of analyzing parallelism; cf S.

In addition to the 'bootstrap hypothesis' and the 'monistic interpretation' of geometrodynamics, parallelists and other 'wholistic thinkers' have taken note of the Bell theorem in quantum mechanics.

Brush, 'The Chimerical Cat: Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics in Historical Perspective', Social Studies of Science, Vol. 10, No. 4 [November 19801, 393-447). One of the noteworthy features of Brush's generally excellent paper is his conception of the pendulum metaphor. He offers a more complex version of the metaphor than other writers by introducing the idea of 'coupled pendula' (in this case, science and culture), and the notions of strong and weak coupling. An even more complex treat- ment of the pendulum metaphor is possible. I am inclined, for example, to see the current swing of the pendulum as a potentially revolutionary one. If we want to use the metaphor to illustrate the emergence of a new themata (to use Holton's concept), we can imagine that (a) additional energy has pushed the limits of the extremes of the pendulum's swing further out, or (b) the pendulum has, due to a more complex energy input, moved out of the plane of thought we are used to and into a new plane, with a different amplitude and a different period. 54.

In keeping with the objectives of my 'recon- naissance', I have aimed throughout Parts I and II of this paper at touching on as many of the issues and problems in physics-mysticism parallelism as possible, guided by a sociological perspective. My objective in this bibliographic essay is to note resources which, for various reasons, could not be dealt with in the paper proper but</page><page sequence="25">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 61 which might be useful for scholars interested in pursuing research on physics, mysticism, and society. a. Physics-Mysticism Parallelism Numerous articles, books, and monographs defending parallelism have come to my attention since I completed Part I.' They illustrate a tendency among parallelists to (1) mystify mysticism and to homogenize the variety in mystical experiences, and (2) stress the 'profound', 'pure', and 'perfect' nature of the mystical experience. This tendency is illustrated in works spanning a wide range of disciplines and perspectives.2 The related defence of 'mystery' is illustrated in the works of J.H. Morrison on Christianity and science, Radhakrishnan on Eastern and Western thought, and Jastrow on astronomy and religion. Theodore Roszak is well-known for his defence of 'the legitimate mysteries'.3 Capra has publicized his views in numerous articles and lectures.4 Among his many speaking engagements, one is especially noteworthy. On 10 and 11 June 1978, Capra had his first opportunity to enter into what he described as 'a full exchange with a representative of the mystical tradition'. The mystic was Pir Vilayat Khan, Head of the Sufi Order in the West. Pir Vilayat is the eldest son of Hazrat Pir-O- Murshid Inayat Khan, founder of the Sufi Order. Capra and Pir Vilayat have since appeared together on other programmes. The study of physics-mysticism parallelism is part of the broader study of the rela- tionship between science and religion. Significant complications arise within this broader context. The distinction between science and religion is drawn in a wide variety of ways. I assume that these variations are systematically related to social, cultural and historical factors.5 The relationships are not simple; but in terms of an 'interests' thesis, it might be expected that if an individual is committed to both science and religion (as indicated, for example, by educational background and pro- fessional role), he/she will seek to reconcile the two modes of thought. If an in- dividual is committed to one mode, then all other modes will be opposed in some way; and the opposition will be more intense to the extent that conflicts between or among modes become more visible and more serious. The variety of interests people have in science and religion as cultural resources is reflected in the variety of ways in which they deal with the relationships between science and religion. P. Duhem separates Roman Catholicism and physics so that they do not have implications for each other; G.C. Henry, Jr argues that mathematics is a traditional adjunct to Christian theology (Henry holds degrees in physics, mathematics, theology, and religion); the English biologist W.O. Green- wood views science as one of the methods by which God reveals Himself; the search for God, the Darwinian doctrine of natural selection, and the DNA genetic code are reconciled by the Oxford zoologist Alister Hardy; Harvard geologist K.F. Mather, a monist, distinguishes two alternating roles in science and religion, prophet and priest; Arthur Eddington, a physicist and a devout Quaker, creates a spiritual bridge across 'the epistemological gap' between what physicists know and what they cannot know; and D.J. Kevles, in The Physicists, discusses the case of physicist Robert Millikan who found evidence for the existence of God in the 'birth cries' of 'atoms' now known as cosmic rays. Mysticism (as opposed to 'religion') may have a special appeal for physicists - or certain types of physicists - but the evidence is</page><page sequence="26">62 Social Studies of Science equivocal. This is illustrated by the contrast between Capra (who views physics and mysticism as complementary), Shook, a physicist who is at pains to distinguish and separate mysticism and physics, and physicist H.K. Schilling, who discusses the compatibility of science and religion.6 b. Sociology of Mysticism The need for a demystification of mysticism has been widely noted, and some pro- gress toward a sociocultural interpretation of mysticism has been made. The major classical contribution to the sociology of mysticism is in Weber's study of Indian religion. Among more recent contributions, two stand out: Collins's paper on the occult traditions, and the collection of papers edited by Bourguignon. Collins's study brings the tools of sociology to bear on the task of explaining occult thoughts and activities. He views occultism and mysticism as strategies in intellectual conflict. His comparative historical method is complemented by the field studies carried out in non-Western cultures by Bourguignon and her associates. Several social an- thropologists (for example, E. Norbeck, H.A. Junod, B.A. Warwick, and M.J. Field) have contributed to the demystification of mysticism. One of the most impor- tant works in this area is E.E. Pritchard's Nuer Religion.7 Mysticism has not been studied extensively by sociologists of knowledge. Gur- vitch, Scheler and Stark offer brief but hardly enlightening remarks on mysticism.8 Efforts to deal specifically with the sociological aspects of mysticism are, as in the works of I.M. Lewis, and Greeley and McCready, generally narrow in conception and scope. Lancelot Whyte, on the other hand, offers a broad, insightful analysis of mysticism in his book, The Universe of Experience, which sociologists should find quite rewarding. And S.T. Katz gives an excellent account of the variety of mystical experiences, and discusses the absurdity of the claim that there are 'pure' (that is, unmediated) experiences.9 Some students of mysticism defend the 'catastrophe hypothesis' that people turn to 'inner seeking' in times of war and social turmoil (for example, H. Bridges). Others (for example, C. Geertz) defend the 'chronic troubles hypothesis' that ex- periences such as suffering and evil are a constant source of uneasiness and religio- mystical adaptations. 10 Studies of mysticism and society generally support the blunt and pithy 'theory' put forth by E.B. Tylor in 1889: Bread and meat would have robbed the ecstatic of many an angel visit; the open- ing of the refectory door must many a time have closed the gates of heaven to his gaze.II The specific case of Buddhism as a social phenomenon is discussed by P.A. Par- due, K.K.S. Ch'en, L. Stryk, Monier Monier-Williams and Margaret Stevenson. These writings cover nearly a century of Buddhist scholarship, and vary in quality; but they provide a good introduction to the sociocultural roots of Buddhism. The survey by Emma M. Layton on Buddhism in American and M. Spiro's study of Burmese Buddhism strengthen the argument that religion and mysticism must be ex- plained as adaptations to universal experiences and particular sociocultural milieux. 12 It is hardly possible to conceive of a sociology of mysticism which is not at the</page><page sequence="27">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 63 same time a social psychology of mysticism. There is a need in this respect to bring together studies of consciousness in general and of mystical consciousness in par- ticular. C.O. Evans, in The Subject of Consciousness, conceptualizes consciousness in a way that suggests what a mystical experience is. T. Ribot, in The Psychology of Attention, written at the turn of the century, conceives St. Teresa's seven stations of prayer or meditation as stages of increasing concentration culminating in a homogeneous state of consciousness he calls 'absolute monisleism'. An 'unlocaliz- ed' theory of the mystical process is outlined by K. Pribram in his book, Languages of the Brain. And a cross-cultural treatment of mysticism is sketched in the in- troduction to the collection of field studies edited by Bourguignon, and referred to earlier. 13 It is important to approach the notion of a sociology of mysticism with an ap- preciation for Bennetta Jules-Rosette's cautions on evaluating non-Western thought forms as maladaptive, and confusing them with altered states of consciousness.14 Other problems and perspectives relevant to the programme for a psychosocial theory of mysticism are discussed in the works of J. Runzo, who suggests that visual rules in representational art are operative in certain visions; G. Richards, who sug- gests that the meaning of sunyata should be sought in its use in life rather than located in an 'objective referent or counterpart'; and J.R. Horne, who discusses variations and incommensurabilities in mystical experiences. Horne's view of mystical experi;nce as 'one of the most disorderly experiences in life', should be compared with W.T. Stace's view in Mysticism and Philosophy that mysticism is continuous with everyday experience. The controversial problem of the relationship between psychopathology and mysticism is treated in J. White (ed.), The Highest State of Consciousness. The papers by Wapnik, Owens, and Prince and Savage are especially recommended. R.W. Hood, Jr offers a persuasive argument against the legitimacy (from a conceptual as well as an empirical viewpoint) of relating mysticism and regressive, pathological behaviours. R.C. Zaehner's Mysticism: Sacred and Profane, and S. Arieti's The Intrapsychic Self should also be consulted on this topic.'5 'Wandering' is a critical phenomenon which warrants investigation in any sociological approach to mysticism. It is a widely noted feature of the mystical life that links the lives of mystics and magicians from the Buddha and Bruno to the nomadic sorcerers of various cultures. This phenomenon is vividly manifested in the life of 'the renunciator'. The 'going forth' and wandering are the first acts of the renunciator; monasticism and the virtuoso elaboration of religio-mystical ideas are the culmination of these acts. 'The Going Forth', one of the oldest poems in the Buddhist literature, offers an especially clear account of renunciation. The monastic culture of renunciators is discussed by S. Dutt in Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India. 16 Durkheim's study of The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life suggests a theoretical way of organizing the materials on wandering and mysticism. The psychological effect of wandering may parallel the psychological effect of being 'in society' and, following Durkheim's analysis, experiencing the collectivity as a 'sacred' realm. But in the 'going forth', there is no conventional social soil to root one's feelings and experiences in. There is, of course, a 'remembered' collectivity, and sometimes a new monastic community. If the wanderer's experience is going to have a 'god-related' consequence, there must be an orientation to seeking salvation (often through a religious conviction hostile to conventional society). Mystical ex-</page><page sequence="28">64 Social Studies of Science perience, in this sense, is to the individual what, in Durkheimian terms, traditional religious experience is to everyday life. If it is more 'mysterious' and 'abstract', it may be because under conditions of renunciation 'Society' is more mysterious and abstract. Ironically, an unfulfilled need for 'Society', or an ambiguous 'societal' feeling may intensify the individual's experience of the collectivity's presence. In Durkheim's terms, this can be conceived as the result of carrying the individualiza- tion of collective ideals to its extreme. This thesis is consistent with (1) the logical argument that the description of a mystical experience as 'the presence of God' must be based on the assumption that god exists (an argument that can be modified to take into account alternative assumptions that underlie alternative descriptions of mystical states); (2) the hypothesis that 'supernatural referents' always resemble humans (anthropomorphism), animals (theriomorphism, zoomorphism), values (anthroposocial), or human mentality (anthropopsychic); and (3) the hypothesis that religio-mystical systems are primarily ontological and eschatological and not parts of academic and clinical sciences such as psychotherapy and opthalmology. It is interesting to note the consistency between this line of thought and E. Underhill's view of the 'I' as the 'point of departure' in mysticism. The variety of sociocultural milieux and collective ideals can account for the variety of mystical experiences, the constraints on human living (for example, universal needs) for the ubiquitous aspects of mysticism. The Durkheimian approach to mysticism I have sketched is reinforced by Weber's analysis of the 'affinity' between the concept of God and political organization. There is, then, a strong alternative 'story' of mysticism available - however tentatively - in the sociological literature to oppose to Capra's mystification. 17 c. Physics and Mysticism in Society and History Parallelism is not a new phenomenon. For example, tensions between old ('causal') and new ('acausal') physics, conflicts between science and anti-science, and arguments for mystical science emerged in Weimar Germany during the 1920s.18 Rudolf Steiner's attack on science was countered by von Laue with support from Planck in the early 1920s. In the late 1920s, Ostwald and Sommerfeld criticized 'rampant mysticism'; but at the same time Sommerfeld (not unlike Capra) sought to project an image of physics tailored to the anti-rational and anti-positivist critics of science. 19 Arguments for mystical science appeared in the works of Spengler and von Mises. Spengler predicted the decline of natural science and its salvation by a new mysticism. Von Mises defended a form of parallelism that linked modern physics to the Hermetic tradition. He argued that the atomic physicists of his day were taking up once more the questions addressed by the old alchemists, and attending to numerical harmonies and mysteries in a manner reminiscent of the Pythagoreans and Cabbalists. Paul Forman and Phillip Frank have both argued that there were no internal bases for acausal, spiritual, or idealistic interpretations of modern physics, an argument consistent with the strong version of the interests thesis.20 Wholism appears as a theme in the works of Bergson, Troeltsch, Litt, Dreisch and other scholars associated with the rise of Lebensphilosophie and 'wholistic convic- tions' (for example, in neovitalistic biology and Gestalt psychology). Dreisch's philosophy of biology encompassed vitalism, wholism, and idealism. And in 1927,</page><page sequence="29">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 65 L. von Bertalanffy favorably noted a trend to 'vitalistic physics'. 21 There is a tendency among contemporary advocates of wholism to ignore its recurrence in the history of ideas, and especially its association in recent times with the rise of Lebensphilosophie, idealism, and vitalism. Forman's work suggests that wholistic thought can be wed to totalistic political and religious interests. Jan Smuts outlines a form of wholistic thought that is perhaps more consistent with liberal political thought than the form defended by the German wholists. But some ten years after the publication of Smuts's book, Greenwood associated 'holism' with subordination to the State, the Idea, and other totalistic abstractions. G.W. Morgan, by contrast, treats 'wholism' as 'the never-final, discord- and risk- embracing, living unity of different approaches to the world and of the many facets of the human being'. It is important, therefore, to carefully examine the political im- plications of arguments for wholism (or holism), since they can vary from totalitarian to democratic extremes.22 The distinction between wholes as systems of parts (wholism) and wholes as wholes (holism) needs to be given more attention in addressing the literaturc on wholistic thought. Jaspers, Teilhard de Chardin, and Reiser offer a perspective on wholism as a mental adaptation to an emerging global consciousness. It is also possible to con- ceive of contemporary wholism as a recurring themata, following Holton, alter- nating with an atomistic perspective in a cyclical unfolding of cultures in history. Cicourel argues that perception and cognition are multimodal - they are simultaneously visual, aural, and emotional. Following Cicourel, the different modalities of cognition (for example, wholism and atomism) can be viewed as com- plementary. One or another modality may be ascendant at any particular time. Shifts in prevailing modalities may be an 'invariant process' variously referred to as 'swings of the pendulum' or 'thematic dialectics'. On the civilizational level, prevail- ing modalities may be identified as 'ages', as in Bochner's study of the history of knowledge, Eclosion and Synthesis.23 Forman remarks on certain similarities between the United States in the 1960s and 1970s and Weimar culture. Other scholars have pointed out parallels between the present cultural climate and that of earlier periods such as late Egyptian antiquity, the waning years of the Roman Empire, and the late Renaissance. The late Renaissance has been of particular interest to students of occultism, mysticism, and science in contemporary society.24 Moreover, some scholars argue that modern science retains fundamental links with, or residues from, the animistic, spiritualistic physics of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the early Newtonian era.25 Numerous aspects of intellectual activity in the Renaissance and the early Newtonian era echo contemporary parallelism. Ancient wisdom was glorified in the works of thinkers such as Pico, Campanella, Henry More, and Roger Bacon.26 The 'journey eastward' in search of occult wisdom is not only a feature of the late Renaissance; it is a tradition that stretches from Pythagoras to Goethe and to our own times. Renaissance thinkers, incidentally, could look to their immediate past for precedents in glorifying ancient wisdom. Early medieval scholars 'discovered' Pythagorean and Platonic anticipations in Moses and the Prophets. This was the result of a search for a single tradition running through all earlier thought, a prisca theologia. Aspects of Renaissance thought that appear to have been resurrected in contem- porary culture are (1) the conception of the route to absolute knowledge as a mystical path; (2) syncretism; (3) the subordination of criticism to advocacy; (4) an</page><page sequence="30">66 Social Studies of Science appreciation for the negative way, or 'learned ignorance'; (5) wholism - Cusa's no- tion of 'coincidenta oppositorum', for example, invites comparison with the inscrip- tion on Neils Bohr's coat-of-arms (reproduced in Capra's book), 'Contraria sunt complementa'; (6) the transcendence of traditional boundaries between disciplines or modes of knowing; (7) the mystical interpretation of ancient wisdom to reinforce present beliefs (More's Christian interpretation of Platonism is an example of this); (8) the idea of infinitely expanding toward divinity (a contemporary example is the speculation by Bentov and others that consciousness can be expanded throughout an infinite sphere of information); (9) the development of a world picture that provides and reinforces an image of divinity; (10) a spiritual retreat from the terrible prob- lems of the everyday world in search of peace and purity; and (11) various forms of anti-parallelism (in, for example, the debates between Pythagoreanism and the 'new science'). The residue of Renaissance parallelism is reflected in Newton's view of himself as a 'rediscoverer', rather than an 'innovator'. The spiritualist or mystical tendency is not new in physics. One finds it in Kepler, of course, and later in scientists from Crookes, Oliver Lodge, and James Jeans to Eddington and Milne. Labels for modern physics such as 'mystical physics' echo eighteenth-century debates about 'holy physics', the concept of physicasacra (which expressed the 'perfect harmony' between Newtonian physics and Genesis), and the numerous systems of physiktheologie.27 d. Cognitive and Social Change in Science and Society If the Renaissance Hermeticists were in some sense harbingers of the Scientific Revolution, is it possible that the physicists' 'capitulation to Spenglerism' (the phrase is Forman's) in the 1920s and 1930s, and parallelism today, are harbingers of a new scientific revolution? Boulding offers an ecological perspective on this possibility. He argues that science 'is expanding into what seems like a very large niche in the human nervous system'. But we know that no ecological niches are in- finite; thus we can anticipate that science will lose its adaptive potential and 'become a church, concerned mainly with transmitting the treasures of its knowledge unim- paired from one generation to the next'. The shadow of this event 'may already be falling across us. . .'.28 Boulding thus raises the question of how we 'open', or 're- open', science (and society). Some scholars are currently dealing with this problem by opposing fragmentation in our lives with programmes for wholeness in lifestyles, values, and modes of thought. The literature on wholistic and relational perspectives spans virtually all disciplines.29 In some respects, wholism appears to be a reaction to 'the trap of rationality'. Grange argues that we should not be surprised to find 'magic' (which originally referred to 'the absence of technique') in the air, given the 'obviousness' of our technology, closure in science, and the encounter with recalcitrant problems in the struggle for survival and growth. This is consistent with the ideas discussed in the last section of Part II.30 We may be in a 'critical period' (to use Tiryakian's phrase), a 'waning period' whose character (and perhaps whose fate) is captured in the title of M. Harrington's The Twilight of Capitalism, and somewhat more forebodingly in the title of L. Stavrianos's The Promise of the Coming Dark Ages. The 'promise' rests on the potential of a cultural 'sleep of the senses' to generate a revolution in human ways of</page><page sequence="31">Restivo: Physics/Mysticism Parallelism 67 living and thinking. Such a revolution requires a certain loosening of canons of logic and rigour, and in this sense the 'flaws' in parallelism (from a sociological perspec- tive) may contribute to the development of new, more advanced modes of thought and the further evolution of inquiry.31 I. Hassan notes that 'current analogies between science, culture, and sundry ar- tistic and spiritual phenomena can prove too facile'. Yet, he argues, 'it is possible to be at once too rigorous and too timorous in exploring the cognitive possibilities and the homologies'. Analogies can be starting points for 'further verification' if homologies are sought as the bases for constructing structural models. The search for structural homologies, however, can be based on the same sorts of motives underlying the more facile search for analogies. Hassan's notion of seeking 'a star- ting point for further verification' is consistent with the idea that loosening canons of rigour and logic can 'spring the trap of rationality'; but it can be subordinated to individual and collective interests focusing on reducing dissonance, expanding spheres of influence, and so on. Unraveling these sorts of issues is a precondition for comprehending and playing an active part in sociocultural change. We may, as Hassan writes, be 'living in liminal times, at the threshold of changes in the human measure more profound than any we can imagine', or 'simply living through the ordinary nightmare of history from which there is no awakening'.32 0 NO TES for Bibliographical Essay 1.

There are, of course, pitfalls in this exercise. Parallels, in the sense of an- ticipations in, or the originality of, ancient wisdom, make sense to the extent that past and present settings and experiences are similar, elicit similar patterns of behaviour, and generate similar symbols and meanings. But environmental and sociocultural changes affect the information content of symbols quantitatively and qualitatively. Comparisons based on assumptions about the information content of symbols (and thus the deeper comprehension they reflect) become, as society and consciousness change qualitatively (for example, evolve), progressively stripped of meaning. 26.
