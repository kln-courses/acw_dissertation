<plain_text><page sequence="1">Section I: ANCIENT INDIA Sectional President's Address TRANSITIONS IN EARLY TAMIL SOCIETY: A HYPOTHESIS ON THE FORMATION OF TAMIL REGION K.N. Ganesli At the outset, allow me to express my sincere thanks to the Indian History Congress of inviting me to preside over the Ancient India Session of the Indian History Congress being held at Cuttack. It is indeed a great honour for someone who has written most of his works in his mother tongue, and has only published a few papers in English. I have chosen in this address to pursue a theme in South Indian History that has occupied my attention for the past decade that of analyzing the Early Tamil te&gt;Āļts and corroborating the information and insights from the texts using evidence from other Sources on Tamil History. Early History of South India has received considerable scholarly attention in recent years. This is because South India has witnessed processes of social and cultural transformation different from the historical processes elsewhere in India. These processes have included the emergence of a distinct group of Dravidian languages, formation of linguistic communities based on them, as well as emergence and transformation of distinct social, economic and cultural forms. These features were stressed by British colonial administrators, scholars and Missionaries, who posited the term 'Dravidian culture' as a generic term for South Indian society and culture.1 Efforts in understanding this cultural distinctiveness, along with the discovery of substantial amount of archaeological, epigraphical and literary sources, facilitated research on History of South India in general and early History of Tamil country in particular as the prime source of 'Dravidian culture'. A survey of the enormous literature that has been published on the early History of south India is not intended here, and is also beyond the capabilities of the present writer.2 Tamil country or Tamilakam that has included the present states of Kerala and Tamilnadu has long been recognized as the region that has played the significant role in the distinctiveness of South Indian society. Research on the history of early Tamilakam or Tamil country has generated interesting debates and insights that have contributed substantially to our understanding of the emergence of a regional identity in the context of the social transitions taking place in the Indian subcontinent as a whole. Our attempt is to examine some of these formulations and insights on the basis of the available evidence in order to arrive at a possible hypothesis on the formation of the Tamil region. Transitions in early Tamil Society: The existing formulations The Tamil speaking region or Tamilakam is referred to in early Sangam texts.3 They refer to a territory from Venkatam (Tirupati hills) to Kumari (Cape Comorin) where Tamil language was spoken.4 Asokan inscriptions refer to various chiefdoms, but do not refer to them as inhabiting a common cultural region.5 Greek accounts show familiarity with Pandyas and Cholas6. Periplus of the Eritrean Sea refers to a region called damirike7 and Ptolemy refers to the same region as Lymiricke8, showing that a composite region was being indicated from the early centuries of the Common Era among the people mentioned as keprobothras( Keralaputras) and Pandyas9. By 5th century, the term Dravida and dramila begins to appear</page><page sequence="2">24 IHC: Proceedings , 74th Session, 20Ì3 more frequently as shown by the reference to the Dravida sangha founded by the Jaina monk Vajranandi10. Thus by 5,h century terms like Dravida, Dramila or Tamil, with which tenns like damirike can be identified, had come into being as denoting a separate region11. The actual extent of the region is not altogether free from ambiguity. Periplus of the Eritrean Sea refers to damirike as the region to south of the Daksinabades( daksinapatha- Deccan), which can be reached from the sea with the ports of Naura and Tyndis12. Naura has not been identified and Tyndis is probably the same as Tondi, one of centers of the Cheras. This means that damirike begins from the area now part of northern Kerala. However, early Tamil texts refer to Oonurn( Koonur in Nilgiri hills), Pazhi14, Punnad15 and Erumeyur16 which can all be located in the area around Nilgiri hills including Northern Kerala and probably southern Karnataka. Similarly, the reference to Ilantiraiyan indicates the territory of the later Paliavas17. All these are referred to as part of the region of the Tamil speakers, with the speakers of other languages treated as Molipeyar Desam '* . This means that Damirike of the Greco- Roman texts should be treated as a linguistic region. Such a formulation is capable of generating a major debate and it has done so. One major feature of the debate has been a question of precedence. Tamil scholars have argued that the formation and spread of Tamil literature and culture, as revealed in the early Tamil texts have been preceded by the emergence of Tamil language and grammar19. There have been two versions of this argument. Some scholars inspired by Tamil 'patriotism' have evoked the story of the three Sangams as narrated in the early medieval Tamil text Iraiyanar ahapporul , and have maintained that the two grammarians Akattiyar and Tolkappiyar have already been referred to in the itaichankam( middle sangam) period, that is, before the present corpus of early Tamil songs appeared20. Others, less persuaded by Tamil Patriotism, have maintained that Tolkappiyar, the grammarian whose text is available to us in full, have been influenced by Sanskrit Grammarians Panini and Patanjali and possibly the jain text, Aindra Vyakarana21. Still, they would argue for the precedence of the grammar to literature, and some have maintained that Tolkappiyam was composed at a date not later than 500 BC22. Even those who would accept a later date for the currently available text of Tolkappiyam have argued that an original text existed, compiled sometime in 200BCE". There were also a few dissenting voices. They have argued that while our information on a text by Akattiyar have been few, fragmentary and unreliable.Tolkappiyam should be taken as the text indicative of the genesis of Tamil language. Even a cursory examination of Tolkappiyam would assure us that the text attempts to theorize and systematize the already existing practices of Tamil language on the basis of possibly Paninian and aindra traditions24. Hence, it has been argued that the linguistic and grammatical works in Tamil were composed after the emergence of the early Tamil songs, and marked the development of the formal and structural aspects of language25. Here also, it has been maintained that the formulations in Tolkappiyam have been directly adapted from Sanskrit grammatical traditions26. Arguments to the contrary that the effort by Tolkappiyam was to systematize the indigenous Tamil expressions rather than impose an alien structure upon Tamil, has also been made27.This argument is ,of course, based on the assumption that the oral tradition has been anterior to the linguistic systematization of the Tamil language.2* The problem of the emergence of Tamil language implies the emergence and spread of the population speaking the language. Earlier ethnographic studies discussed the possibility of a migrant 'Dravidian' population intermixing with indigenous population, although there is no concrete evidence for such a suggestion. Linguists have pointed to the language of the Todas in the Nilgiris as preserving the archaic form of Tamil similar to Sangam Tamil29. A large number of loan words from Prakrit and Pali were incorporated into this archaic Tamil, showing that the language was being modified by migrants from different parts of India30. Classical Tamil, as it emerged by the early medieval period, incorporated a number of</page><page sequence="3">General President 's Address 25 Sanskrit words also, thus demonstrating that the formation of Tamil language was also at the instance of the migration and incorporation of populations31. The term Dravida or dramila simply denoted the linguistic integration of this population. The process of transformation of this population has been a matter of serious debate. The earlier historians, working within the conception of the duality of 4 Aryan' and Dravidian' attempted to postulate two stages of this transformation. The tribal 'Dravidian' people were forming their settlements in the Tamil country. They were engaged in hunting, pastoral ism, fishing and probably shifting agriculture. They worshipped Gods like Murukan and Korravai and were also engaged in warfare among themselves, for cattle and other forms of wealth. Their war chiefs became velir, who became the first form of political authority in the region12. Later, the valleys of the major rivers like Kaveri and Vaigai were occupied and the chiefs who developed there became the first kings or ventans. Ventans referred to the three kings (muvar or muventar), the Cheras, cholas and Pandyas33. Early Tamil songs related to Tinai geographies depicted the process of social evolution from hunting gathering, pastoralism and agriculture leading to the formation of early kingdoms14. This picture of the social and political changes in early Tamil country has been criticized citing various reasons. It has been pointed out that the Ttnais were literary conventions used by the early Tamil singers, and they referred to literary spatiality that broadly corresponded to real geographies. The Tina' geographies were not representing social evolution, but were modes of production that co-existed and interacted with one another15. Velir were chiefs who sustained themselves by conducting predatory cattle raids using their kin groups and warriors. Early Tamil poetry consisted of heroic songs intended to praise the chiefs and warriors involved in such raids36. The Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas were not kings in the conventional sense, but only chiefs who acquired more power and wealth by conquering other chiefs and assuming control of the riverside littoral regions, of the Marutam Tmai37. Tinai geographies have been approached from a different perspective also. Tirtais have been considered to be zones of ecological adaptation where different forms of livelihood were being adopted by population on the basis of the environmental characteristics of the different geographical tracts18. People of the tinai were kinship groups who labored for their subsistence with the help of the resources that can be mobilized from their eco-zones. Organization of kinship groups into familial units or kudis provided the basis of the distribution of settlements, which has been testified by the distribution of megalithic burials. Political regions , according to this perspective, was formed on the basis of subsistence economies, that gave rise to pre-state formations based on the acquisition and control of resources and unequal distribution of social wealth39. The process of transition from tribe to state has also been debated. The arguments by early historians have focused on the 'Aryanisation' process that has included Brahmana migrations and the performance of Vedic sacrifices by several Chera, Chola and Pandya rulers40. The introduction of Dharmic and Shastraic elements in the development of kingship in the Tamil country has been stressed in the recent studies also41. Other studies have pointed to the formation of nadu in early historic period, which has been identified as a janapada type of political formation42. A persuasive set of arguments have been advanced with regard to the impact of the Greco-Roman trade on the emerging kingdoms in the Tamil country43. The Greco-Roman trade resulted in the export of spices, textiles, precious stones, coral and pearl from Tamilakam and import of bullion, which encouraged the circulation of commodities and the development of major ports of trade and interior market towns44. The rulers of the rivers valleys who were in a position to control both the commodities and the process of trade, developed into the early states. Thus the Cheras controlled karur,Kodumanal and Mucin, Cholas Uraiyur and Puhar, and the Pandyas, Madurai and Korkai. This also</page><page sequence="4">26 I HC : Proceedings , 74th Session , 2013 meant that there were deliberate efforts by the ventans to extend their sway to the coastal regions where important maritime ports were located45. The arguments regarding the emergence of'state and kingship have also been contested. The Chera-Chola-Pandya triad were little more than chiefdom states that depended on kinship structures and dependent warriors, with the additional resources for their conquests coming from surplus produce of the marutam and neytal regions46. Stray references to sacrifices in early Tamil texts are insufficient to show that a Dharmic and shastraic concept of kingship had consolidated. The Roman trade, believed to have facilitated the state formation, was little more than unequal exchange between an Empire and a group of tribal chiefdoms47. The spread of Roman coin hoards did not imply monetization of the economy and the resulting consolidation of surplus in the hands of chiefs, which would have provided stable financial foundations for the emergence of state. It is possible that the Roman coins were not used as money, but as luxury articles hoarded by the members of the ruling kinship groups or traders48. Similar debates are occurring regarding the transition processes during and after the early historic period. Early historians predisposed towards the dynastic concept of political processes postulated an intervening period between the early historic "kings' and the later emergence of Pandya and Paliava states. This period called 'Kalabhra interregnum' was presumably from 3"1 to sixth centuries CE, when the Tamil country was believed to have been overrun by Northern invaders , called 'kalabhras'49. The kalabhra rule particularly that of the king referred to in the Buddhist chronicles by the name Accuta Vikkanta was regarded as a period of Buddhist domination50. The interregnum was succeeded by the Pandya-Pallava kingship which also saw the emergence of Brahmanas as the dominant social and ideological force. This argument is, in effect, a continuation of thee thesis of 'Aryanisation' where the transformation of Tamil society occurred because of the intervention of the migrants and invaders from the north. The transformation was also the result of the growth and expansion of the agrarian economy of Tamil country, which provided the basis for the new political structure. The transition might have also been facilitated by the decline of Roman trade, which contributed to the growth of the early historic political formations. The Kalabhra argument has been revived in another form, by characterizing them as 'Kaliyarasar '. The term has been linked to the depiction of the 'kali Age' by the Brahmanas, which was considered as a period of social crisis51. The social crisis of the early Tamil society has been depicted as the period, in which the tribal society underwent transformation. New social divisions between the higher and lower strata appeared and systems of exploitation and plunder began to emerge. Kaliyarasar presumably referred to the political power exercised by such exploiting groups. The breakdown of tribal society and the emergence of stratified and exploitative social order, made the growth of a new state form necessary, and this was made possible by the Brahmanic 'discourse of social differentiation and stratification'52. It can be seen that despite the differences in emphasis on the processes of social stratification and state formation, a general argument emerges on the processes of social transition in early historic Tamil society. Early historic Tamil society was a tribal society that was undergoing changes due to three identifiable processes. The first was the conflicts for resources and wealth, specifically cattle raids that resulted in the formation of chiefdoms; the second was occupation of riverside agricultural tracts and the growth of overseas and internal contacts with other parts of India and the world that contributed to the formation of early states. The third was a period of crisis that led to 'the breakdown of the tribal society and the emergence offa class divided society characterized by stratified agrarian order, and the social and ideological dominance of the Brahmanas53. There are of course dissenting views such as the denial of the role of overseas contacts and the emergence of a state form</page><page sequence="5">General President s Address 27 in the early historic period. There is no difference regarding the general process of transition from the early historic to the formation of early medieval states, beginning from about 7,h century AD.54 The argument does not answer the prime question of the formation of the Tamil region. The transition from early historic was not simply a process of transition from tribe to state, from tinai geographies to the territory of the Paliavas, Pandyas and the Cholas. It was also the period when the territory of the Tamil speaking people was being carved out, with its own social and cultural features. It is this question that we propose to address in the remaining parts of this presentation. Formation of Tamil region Human occupation of the present Tamil region has been dated back to prehistoric times. Paleolithic discoveries from Attirampakkam, Mesolithic remains found all over Tamil country, Neolithic finds in Aticchanallur, Paiyampalli and the Teri sites in South-Eastern Tamilnadu, provide evidence on the human occupation of the region.55 This is followed by substantial traces for human occupation during the megalithic phase from about 1 000 BCE56. The question of continuity or discontinuity of human occupation is far from certain, although there is some evidence for the existence of Mesolithic remains in the proximity of megalithic burial sites57. Discovery of a large number of megalithic sites all over south India, show an expansion of human settlements during the first millennium BCE. South India that was part of the Deccan plateau provides evidence for human settlement through the substantial number of Neolithic sites, and expansion through megalithism. This expansion is clearly the result of Iron Age technology and substantial transformation of the environment through labour processes, including transition to agriculture58. Expansion of megalithic burial sites in Tamil country which has yielded far lesser number of Neolithic sites appears to be significant. This may signify population movements of some kind during the millennia before Common Era59. One cannot hazard any generalization regarding such movements, until the archaeologists discover more habitation sites. At present our information on habitation sites is limited to the recent excavations at Kotumanal and Poruntal60, apart from some political and commercial centers such as Karur, Uraiyur and a few port centers61. Detailed explorations for habitation sites may add to our information on population movements. Information from megalithic burials demonstrates both commonalities and differences among human population that have left behind these artifacts. Black and Red ware pottery has been discovered from South as well as eastern India62 and Russetted Coated ware has been discovered fror. à Andhra and Tamil country63. Passage chambers and shaft graves have been discovered in Karnataka64, while urn burials have been found all over, particularly in the coastal region. Memorial stones are similarly distributed in different parts of South India. Some such stones, such as kodakkals ('Umbrella stone') and Toppikkals ('hat stone'), appear to be 'externalities' as they are found in overseas sites65. With some variations, the burials display features of common culture called Iron Age megalithic, but the identity of the authors of this culture is far from certain. It is possible that a number of burials belong to a period when regional identities had not yet taken shape and population movements without cultural or political barriers was possible during the first millennium BCE66. The distribution of burials and the nature of grave goods from Tamil country display elements of distinctiveness. Studies and mapping of the burial sites have demonstrated that largest number of burial sites is found in the hilly regions and on the table lands. It has also been shown that clusters of megalithic burials have been found in places that are identified with the Velir chiefs mentioned in the literary sources67. Grave goods in these sites have included apart from pottery, iron implements that could have been used as weapons. However,</page><page sequence="6">28 IHC: Proceedings, 74th Session, 2013 sites in the river valleys, sometimes adjacent to but distinct from hilly and tableland regions have yielded evidence for habitation, trade goods and coins68. Although it is difficult in our present state of information to form definite conclusions about temporal or cultural sequences, it appears possible to postulate that sedentarism, regular production and exchange practices developed among the megalithic people when they occupied river valleys. It is there that regular habitations also could emerge. However, the monument production of the megalithic people shows common features, cutting across geographical variations. They include pit burials, use of cists, cairn circles and occasionally multiple chambers, evidence for fractional burials in urns, distribution of grave goods that share a common, but stratified material culture69. It is to this common cultural pattern that we find trade goods such as precious stones, extraneous pottery and coinage added in river valley or port sites70. Sharing a particular mi/ erial culture by the hill and the river valley people would imply that goods that would be utilized for the making of the culture would be transported from one geographical space to the other. Thus the clay for the making of pots, and the potters themselves would travel from place to place, and iron for making a weapon or an implement would move from a hill slope to a river valley. Beryl and rock crystal from the nearby hills thus reached a trade centre at Kotumanal71 and the pepper and spices from the mountains reached the ports in the West coast. Russetted Coated ware and its technology moved to several parts of South India. Entire grave technologies could have also travelled, as in the rock cut passage chamber tombs in Karnataka, which are found in North Kerala also72. These movements show the circulation of people, technology and culture, the process by which the occupants of different geographical places become interrelated. Thus the hills that compose the Western and Eastern Ghats, the hill slopes and table lands that are distributed in Northern Tamilnad, areas proximate to the Western Ghats, and Kerala, where the megaliths are distributed form a circulation zone linked to the various river valleys in the adjacent regions73. Population can move from the hills to the valleys and vice versa. - Evidence for such movements is found from the early Tamil songs. Tina is of the early Tamil songs not only depict different geographical regions or eco-zones, but also definite relations among these regions. The akam songs among the early Tamil poetry deal with separation of lovers, the women pining for the beloved who has gone far away, or the man rushing home to join the beloved. Separation involves movement, which is indicated as actual movement along the pathways (aruselmakkal)14 or across mountain passes (Curam iraintor) 75or the imagined hazards faced by the lover in an unknown land or enemy territory (Onnar teyam)16. Songs also refer to the movements of bards (panar) and traders (vanikar) as well as the appearance of strangers (vanpalar) along major pathway7^. Such movements show that definite forms and paths of movement had become established by the time of composition of the songs. Such movements are stated to be across crossroads (kavalai) and streets (mamku)1*. They must have crossed forests also.79 Such movements linked different tinai geographies and settlements, including the residences of the chiefs. Movements of the bards are significant here. The panas survived by eulogizing the heroes and also presumably acted as collectors and disseminators of information that saw or heard on the way. The information they gathered could be mythical and real, referring to both the present and the past in the time frame of the bard, as well as proximate and distant in the spatial configuration. The bards moved only in the real space of the kudis, tinais and the abodes of their heroes, but their narratives incorporated allusions to lands tljey probably never saw such as Imayam (Himalayas) and patali (pataliputra)80. In a society of multiple economies and geographies, the movements of the panas were facilitated by the language of communication. A linguistic community was formed, which distinguished itself from- the other linguistic territories or Molipeyar teyam or colpeyar teyam .SI Linguistic community thus transcended the tribal segments of kinship (kilai' habitat (kut i), settlement (Ur) and</page><page sequence="7">General President 's Address 7.9 human ecology (tinai) and developed the composite concept of tinai (Tmaimayakkam). It is not surprising that within a linguistic community, real geographies become literary spatialitLs and literary formulas become the organizing form of social practices82. Geographical allusions, such as from venkatam to Kumari, simply indicate the space occupied by a linguistic community. A linguistic community is not chronological, although it may have an adequate conception of space and time. Spaces are decided by natural characteristics like mountains and seas and time by cycles of days and nights, as well as seasons. Events become memories reported and narrated by bards. Such events cannot be located in conventional historical time except with direct corroborative evidence, from written or inscribed texts83. Thus the Tamil linguistic community, which was formed as combination of tribal segments and represented in the bardic tradition, becomes chronologically located with the appearance of written texts of the Tamil Brahmi labels. Although there haye been arguments that the Tamil Brahmi script antedates the Ashokan inscriptions, evidence points to the appearance of labels from 2nd Century BCE and they have continued up to 6th century CE when vattezhuttu became widespread84. Brahmi script moved with the movement of populations or population segments using the script, which meant that the Tamil linguistic region was visited by other linguistic groups. This is indicated by the references to vadakar or vatukar "(northerners) and vanpalar , and also to invading groups like Moriyar m and religious groups like maraiyor (Brahmanas) and cavakar or amanar (sramanas)87. Brahmi script thus moved into Tamil country and became indigenized as Tamil Brahmi88. Indigenization of a script is important in the evolution of a linguistic community. A script emerges when a linguistic community acquires a powerful social impetus to write or inscribe things, names, memories, events and traditions. While the oral society communicates things or events as narratives, writing renders such narratives into inviolable records or texts. Orality concretizes things and events by naming them, such as the shift from vadakar to Moriyar , or Molipeyar teyam to konkanam. Writing records the names and events and thus preserves the individuality of the name or the event89. This process can be seen in the Tamil Brahmi labels on memorial stones, caves or pottery that names the person inscribed, or records the grant or gift along with the name90. Such writing or rather inscribing (ezhuttu) distinguishes or individuates the name or an event among a medley of names and events, so that they can be memorized and event or practice inscribed can be conserved. Such individuation requires that multiplicity of names, and practices have already come into existence and that individuation becomes necessary to achieve distinction from other practices. Thus a wealthy merchant who makes a donation or a chief who dies fighting a war or wins a war becomes a name worth being inscribed and their acts become a tradition (marapu) to be preserved91. It has been argued that the compilation of the songs of an extant tradition in a later period indicates the emergence of a social formation signified by the content of the songs compiled.92 Writing also implies that the linguistic community has become complex enough to accommodate concepts and practices that require distinction and individuation. This is done in two ways. First, the society becomes complex enough to develop new labor practices and technologies, cultural practices, ideas and concepts. Second is the growth of a flexible linguistic form that accommodates new words and symbols that could render these practices, concepts and ideas within the linguistic framework. The first is demonstrated by the expansion of internal and overseas trade, circulation of commodities and expansion of agriculture that facilitated river valley settlements. The latter is demonstrated by the incorporation of a large number of words from Prakrit, Pali, Sanskrit, and even from foreign languages into Tamil. The emergence of Vattezhuttu, attributed to 4,h-6,h centuries AD show that writing had become exclusively based on the Tamil oral form. Such changes also indicate that Tamil region was evolving into a political territory.</page><page sequence="8">30 IHC: Proceedings, 74th Session, 2013 Tamil region as a political territory Bardic poetry has been termed 'heroic poetry' and heroes were created by conflicts over forms of wealth or 'cattle' (inam). Such conflicts provided the themes (turai) of the puram songs and the moments of the conflict were formed as purattinaiP The heroes were the warriors or 'destroyers' (Maravar) and their leaders were the vels . The vels received prestations (tirai) from the settler people (kudimakkal) for the protection of their cattle or wealth94. The defensive process was also a redistributive process, which was celebrated through feasting (undattu, perunchoru) and festivities95. The kin group of the vel as well as the warriors participated in the redistributive process (pakarna), %and the panar who sang and the viraliyax who danced in the festivities also received their gifts (kotai)97. The kudimakka' , the warriors and the kin group of the vel that were involved in the redistributive process formed the earliest political segment within the tribal society. The places denoted in the early Tamil texts as the residences of the vels are also places with clusters of megalithic sites, indicating that they served either as battlefields or clusters of settlements9X.The redistributive process involving the vels also indicated the process of war and protection, with Ve' as the protector-hero sung by the bards. The vels of Parambumalai, Kollimalai, Kutiraimalai, piranmalai, Potiyilmalai eulogized by the bards were the instances of such political segments99. The bardic heroes did not represent sustained political authority over a region. There is no reference to a territory controlled by a Vel , except the hill residence and the kin groups and kudimakkal who were involved in the redistributive process. Many Vels did not leave heirs who took over the control of their residence, with the possible exception of Potiyilmalai. The conflicts over wealth and resources increased as the concepts of wealth underwent change. This was the result of growing access to resources and their circulation that facilitated the development of agriculture and trade. 100 Emergence of not only the three ventans of chera, chola and Pandya, but also other plain chiefs (Mannans) like Atiyamans, and Ilantiraiyan of Thondai, as well as the coastal chief Nannan of ezhilmalai will have to be traced to such processes. Circulation of resources is possible through the movement of people, resources and technologies. Increasing conflicts over wealth stimulates such movements as the settlers are driven out of one area or come under the protection of a chief. More important reason appears to the increase of sedentary population, who need resources for their livelihood. This is indicated by the number of named settlements mentioned in the early Tamil poems, apart from general terms like mutur and s i rur. m Ur becomes a settlement where majority of the population undertake tasks corresponding to the respective tinai geography, where the Ur appears102. The settlers also exchange their surplus goods with others through exchange (notai or rto/w//örl).Exchange took place in exchange centers and streets (maruku, ceri) ""adjacent to the Ur and also in places where pathways intersected (kavalai, munai). Exchange of fish and paddy, meat and paddy, supply of milk and curd are examples of simple exchange104. We also find movement of settlers in the Ur such as smiths, weavers and potters as well as other artisans105, apart from the settlement of drummers (paraiyar and tudiyar) dancers (viraliyar and Koothar) singers (panar) and oracles (velar) for the festivities106. References to the settlement of takadur under Atikaiman Anji and his son Ezhini show the growth of an Ur as an exchange and craft centre107. Chiefs who could control such Urs had better access to the circulated resources and technologies than their hill chief counterparts. Growth of the Urs has several features. Urs in the early Tamil texts appear as agglomerations of habitat ( kudi ), located proximate to the production or livelihood spaces. They also appear as centers to which goods are transported across pathways (aru) and acquired or gathered ( pandam)m . Urs also contain public spaces (potiyil, Manram, Kalam)</page><page sequence="9">General President 's Address 3 1 where public gatherings, festivities and deliberations of chiefs took place109. Protection of the Ur took place with the construction of mud-walls (Jnayil, eyil) ,,(,stone walls (nakar)1" and finally large scale fortifications (aran)112. Such procedures show that the Urs began to transcend the habitat formation of the Tinai. Urs became exchange and redistribution centers, and this meant that the wealth being assembled in the Ur should be protected as they were also susceptible to plunder and destruction. The puram tinais of karantai and Ulinai and the themes ( turáis ) associated with it, specifically narrate this process113. Specificities of siege and conquest show that battles were no longer conducted for the acquisition of wealth, but the acquisition of wealth along with the sites where wealth is located, and destruction involved not only destruction of enemy forces, but enemy bastions also. Thus siege warfare involved not only acquisition of wealth but conquest as well.114 This demonstrates the significance of the allusions to the conquest of Urs by several chiefs. The conquests of takadur (takadurerinta) by Peruncheral irumporai115, conquest of Mokur by Chenkuttuvan116, destruction of kazhumalam by a chola chief 17 are examples. Even the exchange centre of karuvur (karur) might have been similarly acquired by a chera chief (Karuvueriya Olvalko Perucheral Irumporai)118. Such conquests not only signified acquisition of resource centers but also control over the passages that ensured the transportation of goods and movement of population. Frequent references to movement of people along the pathways and incidence of robbery of goods and materials along the pathways showed that chiefs were considered responsible for the maintenance of pathways. This meant that the geographical limits (munai) of the pathways carrying goods and people to Ur, and which were under the protection (kati, kaval) of the Ur became battlefields between chiefs, or between chiefs and marauding groups119. Plunder and arson of habitats and Urs repeatedly mentioned in the palai songs1 2W, and the tirai paid by the people to the chiefs for protection signified the process by which settlements came under the protection of a powerful chief, that is, a chief who commanded sufficient resources to enforce protection121. The incidence of resource mobilization by the chiefs indicated the changes taking place in the society and economy of the region. The tinai geographies had facilitated the exchange among resource regions in various exchange centers. Once exchange centers and settlements came under the protection of the chiefs, negotiations and conflict among the chiefs resulted not only in further conquests by the chiefs but also in further interactions among settlements and resource regions. This is indicated in two ways in the texts. One is the reference to chiefs as 4 sovereigns' (porunan)1 22 of more than one centre, such as the chera being the porunan of karur and tondi, the pandyan controlling kutal(Madurai) and korkai, Chola controlling urantai (uraiyur) and Puhar1". Both the places controlled by the respective chiefs were exchange centers, but the passage from one to the other would also be controlled by the chief. This is seen in the case of cheras, when the centers of kotumanam (kotumanal) and panthar (not identified) are mentioned together124. Cheras are mentioned as controlling the resources of the sea (katalam) and the mountains (rock s-kallam)115, and also were overlords of konkav and puzhiyar. m Over lordship over knocker ensured the supply of precious stones (konkar mani)127 and puzhiyar that of forest produce. Cholas are controlling the resources around Kaveri River, and the Pandyas controlled resources of Vaigai and the corals and sands near korkai. This means that the patterns of conquest indicated in the puram songs and narrated more exclusively for Cheras in Patirrupattu, ensured control of the chiefs over resource regions and labor processes, transcending the tinai geographies. Such control facilitated traffic and exchange of goods. They were not restricted to exchange of tinai goods but also resources from mountains, table lands and seas, including precious stones, metals, clothes, corals, beads and spices. The movement of such goods is indicated by traders specializing such goods or vanikar128. Salt was presumably the first</page><page sequence="10">32 IHC: Proceedings, 74th Session , 2013 such commodity transported by Umanar and their practice, Umanachattu , facilitated similar trading activity iiļ other commodities also129. Goods were transported using wheeled carts (cakatu)1™, which transformed the pathways into regular routes. Vanikar were not restricted to the tinai geographies but came from other parts also and spoke different languages131. This clearly indicated movement of people and traffic in goods from other parts of India, and also overseas. It is difficult to chronologically determine the emergence of such movements of population and goods. Overseas contacts were made with the South Indian coast during first millennium BCE and port centers developed152. Stray migrants from North India might have come down, and hence, the region was not unknown to the North Indians133. Clear evidence for North Indian contacts with region and subsequent movements of population and goods appears from the second half of first millennium BC, specifically from the Mauryan times. The Prakrit foundation of the Tamil Brahmi labels should be seen as continuity from the spread of Ashokan inscriptions, as the labels addressed presumably a population familiar with both Prakrit characters initially and later understood Tamil language134. This shows not only that migrations of the period consisted mainly of merchants, and Sramana, sravakas and monks, who were being indigenized in the later centuries.135 Brahmanas did migrate, but they probably did not establish the dominance of the mercantile sravakas, and were restricted to performance of sacrifices and rituals at the behest of the chiefs136. Both these groups were indigenized though their acceptance of the Tamil language. The movement of merchants is indicated by references to nigamcim ( hiyamam ), indicated in the Brahmi labels and the bardic tradition137. Movement of monks, Buddhist and Jaina is attested by the allusions to them in bardic tradition, monuments and Brahmi labels138. The activity of the migrant traders is also attested to archaeologically by the incidence of precious-stones like carnelian, amethyst, chalcedony and diamond, and the presence of the rouletted ware, and the indication that gangetic nard was exported from ports, apart from punch-marked coins139. There has been sufficient literature on the Greco-Roman contacts with South India to demonstrate the significance of their activity and the extent of the maritime contacts that South India had with the red sea region. This is supported by the evidence from different Roman ports of trade, Pattanam in the West Coast being the latest site excavated. The extent of their mercantile activity is also attested by the Roman coin hoards as well as the evidence from Karur regarding the presence of Roman merchandise in the interior regions14". The impact of the mercantile activity on the Tamil region is a matter that requires careful examination. Exchange within the tinai geographies were in essential commodities, including rice, fish, meat, salt, milk ghee and honey, grass mats, herbs, pots, toddy, wood and metal goods. The goods exchanged by vanikar included clothes, gold, rice and grains, ornaments and precious stones. Tinai exchange did not involve coins. Some of the goods exchanged by vanikar such as stones (mani), beads ( muthu ), pepper (kari), sandal (chanthu, aaram) and other spices were produced, or rather gathered from the Tamil country itself41. However, gold and metals (pon), clothes ( kacchai , kalinkam142) and precious stones were not only indigenous products, but came from different parts of India and were not part of the local exchange processes. They were part of the exotica exchanged in festivities or among the kin groups of the chiefs143. The medium of exchange was punch-marked coins from the north and some of the chiefs like the Cheras and pandyas produced lead coins much in a similar vein144. Roman coins were hoarded, but there is little concrete evidence that they were internally circulated in the early historic period.. There is little to show that Roman trade had a significant impact on the livelihood and labor processes of the population of the Tamil country. For example, although Cheran Chenkuttuvan is supposed to have engaged the yavanas in the sea and probably occupied Muciri, there is little evidence that Muciri remained in the hands of the Cheras145. The gold brought by the Romans went to the cargo-</page><page sequence="11">General President 's Address 3 3 suppliers and the chiefs146. It is possible that the Roman ports remained autonomous, settled by migrant merchants and craftsmen, who had little contact with the indigenous population, except by trade147. It was only with the decline of the Roman trade that indigeni/ation of the migrants began14*. Similarly, evidence for local chiefs occupying or controlling other roinan ports is also very little. Romans might have traded with the local traders, and there is some evidence also of local traders navigating the oceans. All this, along with the evidence regarding the northern merchants and vanikar points to the growth of an exchange economy that developed from the multiple livelihood processes including hunting, gathering the forest produce, fishing and collection of rare items from the sea, collection of spices and precious stones, and also preliminary craft and artisan production. Such an exchange economy did transcend the tribal segmentation, but did not eliminate the tinai geographies as such. Instead, the tinais were integrated in an exchange framework regulated by the redistributive practices of the chiefs, and the settlements and resource regions involved in the exchange frame work became the political territory of the chief. Some of the Vels did continue, but the central position came to be acquired by the chiefs who had the better share of the overland and overseas exchange processes, the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas, who were called the three ventans. In order to retain their control over the exchange economy the ventans also had to acquire and retain control over the various regions, earlier determined by linai geographies. They along with the vels formed a new group of political territories that became part of the Tamil region. Formation of such a political Tamil region is narrated in the Tamil song Sirupanarrupatai.149 The genre called arrupatai is different from the earlier pana songs. While the earlier songs were composed by singers and poets who served the chiefs, the arrupatai songs were composed by often down and out panar who heard about the might of a chief from someone else and set out to eulogize him. This indicates that chiefs had become established and a political territory had been formed. Sirupanarrupatai is interesting in the sense that it describes the political formation of a region in terms of the distribution of the chiefs. Thus the chembiyans (the cholas) become the protectors {kavalar) of the eastern land ( kuna pulamY*' cheliyans become the protectors of the southern land (tenpulam)151, and the kuttuvans are the protectors of the Western land ( kutapulam )152. The protector of the northern land is not specifically mentioned, but kuttuvan is mentioned as having set up his bow ( vánku vil poritta) in the Himalayas, and hence, the northern land was also believed to have been protected by the kuttuvan153. The same song also mentions the kata i ezhii vallai the seven chiefs of the hills154. In spite of the allusion to Himalayas, the landscape of the three ventans and the valíais is firmly grounded in the earlier linguistic territory. The somewhat fuzzy notion of a territory from Venkatam to kumari becomes more accurate, with the postulation of a peninsular region surrounded in three directions by three seas. The boundary to the north was fixed through a probably imagined Imayam , legitimized by the story of the bow. It shows that the notion of a territory, bound by the seas and mountains, was coming into being. The integration of the areas controlled by three ventans and seven valíais into single political region was, of course a difficult process. The texts never refer to any of the ventans as controlling the entire Tamil region. Sirupanarrupatai never refers to any of the ventans as sovereigns of the entire region. However, early texts refer to some of the rulers as conquering the rest of the ventans and valíais such as the victory of nedunjelîyan at Talaiyalankanam and karikalvalavan at venni. Details of these battles are not mentioned in any of the texts155, nor do they correspond to the literary conventions followed in the narratives of open combat or siege warfare. Instead, the conqueror is simply referred to as having defeated the opposing foes and acquired the garland {Malai) and umbrella (venkutai) from the enemies, showing that it was more in the nature of a ritual combat for supremacy, rather than a battle for</page><page sequence="12">34 I HC: Proceedings, 74th Session, 2013 resources or surplus produce1 v' Thus integration of the region was achieved through 'the political supremacy, of any of the ventans, much in the pattern of a digvijaya137. Tamil region as hegemonie landscape Sirupanarrupatai also indicates elements of transition in the conception of the Tamil region. One is the concept of the chief as conqueror ( vertían ) already referred to. Second is that the song is addressed to a chief nelliyakotan of Oymanatu in the nakar of mavilankai, indicating the combination of natu and nakar'5*. The third is the term tamilnilai referred to in connection with the pandiyas159. We shall take up the three indications by starting with the last, as it refers to the question of linguistic territory. Sirupanarrupatai describes the streets (maruku) of Madurai as immersed in the glory and tradition of Tamilnilai. Tamil thus becomes a language and a theme position that forms part of the tradition of Madurai, that is, it forms part of the Madurai culture. This reference indicates the powerful cultural tradition that makes Madurai as the centre of the sangam poets. The cultural tradition itself is the product of the work Iraiyanar akapporul composed during the early medieval period (c. 12,h century)160. But the idea of Madurai as the centre of Tamil probably dates back to 5,h century, when Vajranandi, a Jaina monk, is believed to have founded the Dravida (Tamil) Sangha. Here the term Dravida, Dramila or Tamil not only refers to a language but the theme position of the language. This idea is further strengthened by the reference in Tolkappiyam, which can also be dated to 5lh century, to the places that compose Sentamil (pure Tamil)161. Commentators of Tolkappiyam have attempted to define sentamil land as between Kaveri and vai gai rivers and between Karur in the West and Maruvur (Puhar) in the East162. Tolkappiyam states that pannirunilam (twelve spaces) exist surrounding the sentamil region163. Commentators such as Naccinarkiniyar and Cenavarayar have identified pannirunilam with twelve nadus164. Commentators have also added that the sutra also signifies the nadus around the Tamil region which do not speak pure Tamil. Such a distinction is the result of an attempt to distinguish the Tamil region from the non-Tamil regions territorially, and also to establish pure Tamil, as distinguished from vulgar or kotuntamii both as linguistic and cultural entity165. An early medieval text, nannul by pavananti, also repeats this distinction between Tamil and non-Tamil regions ,66.This distinction is further being stressed in Tolkappiyam itself, when the northern language (which can be interpreted contextually as Sanskrit) is a language where speech and writing is integrated167. Sanskrit is a written language, whereas Tamil has several dialects with a pure form (sentamil), which was also written. Sentamil was already considered as an upper class language16". Here the attempt to elevate Sentamil to the status of the Northern language can also be seen. This reorganization of the linguistic region of the Tamils is taking place during the time when the political territories consolidate. The consolidation is taking place with the emergence of the Nadus as the Tamil region. Even the linguistic territory is conceived in terms of nadus. The term nadu already appears in the early Tamil songs as several chiefs, particularly in the Kurinci tinai are referred to as nadan169. The term appears more frequently in the later songs, and by the early medieval period, the entire Tamil region was conceived in terms of Nadus. Nadus were conceived of as provinces and even as identical with janapadas, but there is now a consensus that nadus referred to clusters of agrarian settlements170. Spread of agriculture in the river valleys was already indicated in the marutam songs. Tolkappiyam still referred to nilam to denote spaces. But by the time the commentaries of Tolkappiyam were composed nadus had become the central territorial entity of the Tamil country and nilam referred to in Tolkappiyam was rendered in terms of nadu by the commentators. This shows that the landscape of Tamil country was transforming during the middle of first millennium C E. when Tolkappiyam took its present shape, and nadus or</page><page sequence="13">General President 's Address 3 5 prototypes of nadus were emerging as the result of the growth of agrarian settlements. Sentami 1 region became the land of the core nadus that spoke what was defined as pure Tamil. The sutras of Tolkappiyam also indicate that a complex form of presenting a linguistic region was coming into use. It refers to four forms of speech (col), qualitative fi varco I), quantitative or material (tiricol), spatial or ecological (tisaicol) and specch forms of the north (vatacol)171 . It is also asserted that the correct, accurate usages (vazhakku) are found in the sentamil lands and the surrounding lands have inaccurate expressions not accepted by the linguistic conventions172. Correct usage implied a clear correspondence between the linguistic expressions and the material practices signified by the expression. Thus the subject and the object, the agency of the speaker and the various resources and natural forces including human beings that are the objects of speech, should correspond fully to form a linguistic territory, This was achieved in the Sentamil territory and less so in the surrounding kotuntamíi( corrupt or vulgar Tamil) regions. It should be noted that, following Tolkappiyam. there were several attempts to provide a comprehensive structure to Tamil language, numerous works on various aspects of Tamil language and literature, including dictionaries and works on poetics were composed in the succeeding centuries173. This process was also assisted by the formation of the separate Tamil script through vattezhuttu that evolved from and at the same different from earlier Tamil Brahmi174. This systematization of Tamil speech and writing provided the basis for the expansion of Tamil literature during the early medieval period. Such consolidation of the Tamil linguistic identity was a facilitated by a number of factors. The growth of political territories implied that major chiefs became patrons of bards and heroic individuals, who gained respect as Pulavar and Chanror'75. Pulavar and Chanror included Brahmana and Sramana migrants, who gradually began to exercise influence in the court as knowledgeable persons176. Such influence is indicated by the claims of some chiefs as having performed Vedic sacrifices ( Palyagasalai Mudukudumi Peruvaluti, Rajasuyam vetta Perunarkili, Karikalvalavan). Several chiefs are mentioned as laid to rest (tunciya) in abodes that are presumably Jaina centers ( Jlavantikaipalli tunciya nanmaran. Kur a pall i Tunciya Perntirumavalavan, cikkarpalli tunciya valiyatanY71. The Jaina penance of fasting unto death (sallekhana) was performed by some chiefs as vatakkirikkal'7s. The political, moral and legal practices brought by the migrants also influenced the chiefs as some of them began to claim that they were defenders of the aram (dharma) and arivu(wisdom)179 Such claims showed not only the impact of the migrants, but also the requirement of chiefs to maintain their political territories. In a situation when the political territories were divided and several chiefs fought one another, it was clear that the concept of the chief as conqueror (ventan) and overlord of conquered people (ko or komari) was not enough to sustain the territory. It was necessary to develop a system of political authority, as indicated in the purattinai, kanci. The devices for enforcing authority would include the use of force, advice, sanctions and moral restrictions180. These injunctions formed a legal and moral code (aram) that ensured political authority and warded off the destabilizing or destructive forces (maram). This process is visible in the case of the Chera chiefs who are eulogized in Patirrupattu. The earlier chiefs addressed in the text were eulogized for their conquests, but the later rulers, from Celvakatunko were addressed as overlords of various places who were responsible for the maintenance of the aram. 181 Aram , along with porul (wealth) and inpam (desire) formed the triad that was adapted from the four purusharthas of the North Indians, with one important change, the omission of deliverance ( moksa , veedu, turuviyal). Thus the purusharthas were adopted for the creation of a moral economy, not only for the different political territories and chiefs, but for the entire Tamil linguistic region. This intent is clear in the foremost philosophical work to</page><page sequence="14">36 IHC: Proceedings, 74th Session, 2013 emerge from Tamil country during the middle of first millennium CE, Mappal (Kurai) by Val lu var IX2. The text obviously attempted to create a moral order for the entire Tamil society to which all sections of society from chiefs to laboring classes were bound. It also recognized the emerging social stratification183. Similar prescriptions for a moral order emerged in later texts like naiadi nanuru , and those works included in the category of kilkanakku1X4. Prescriptions for a moral economy, now based more clearly on lana and Buddhist philosophy, appeared in the longer texts modeled on Sanskrit kavyas, like Chilappatikaram , Manimekalai, Jivakachintamani and Neelikesi. Such social and moral prescriptions were discussed also in texts like Porulatikaram of Tolkappiyam, where the interpretation of meaning in language was related to the material and moral features of the society that spoke the language. Linguistic expressions were explicitly related to the spatial, temporal, and material factors that formed the setting for the speech acts1*5. Again, it has been argued that the linguistic prescriptions in Tolkappiyam have been strongly influenced by Jaina thought1*6. Scholars have pointed to the powerful Brahmanic and Sramanic influence in structuring of South Indian society and culture, and they have used concepts like 'Aryanisation' 'Great and little traditions', and 'secondary state formation1*7'. As indicated above, the Brahmanic and Sramanic influences in Tamil culture after the Ashokan invasions cannot be rejected, but it is possible that the scholars may have overstressed the impact, particularly of the Brahmanas in the early historic period. The influence of the migrant Brahmanas and the Sramanic monks and sravakas cannot be ignored, but there role will have to be set in the background of the changes taking place in the Tamil society. Growth of the exchange ccofcomy. outlined earlier, and the spread of wetland paddy agriculture, as indicated by the reference to the nadus showed that the tinai geographies were transforming, and Urs were being located in the specific productive landscapes (pulam '^.Redistribution processes were also transforming, with the resources and surplus produce being gathered, utilized and exchanged in the major political centers of the chiefs, such as karur, Uraiyur and Madurai. This gave rise to the distinction between Uyarntor or Me lor and the laboring (linai gnar, Vinaivalar) and downtrodden ( Tiyavan , kadaisiyan) groups1*9. As the political territory of the Ven tans expanded, the congregation of resources and goods into major centers also increased, thus creating a non-laboring group of the kin group of ventans, and their dependents, warriors and scholars that subsisted on the resources ( pe rumak kal , perunkuti).m Major merchants, singers and dancers were also part of this upper class. It is these groups, who subsisted on the basis of the growing agriculture and trade that were influenced by the culture and ideas of the northern migrants. It is also important that the existing traditions of the linguistic community and political territory in turn influenced the theory and practice of the migrants. This can be illustrated in the way in which a typical Jain text like chilappatikaram is influenced by the moral economy developing in the period that a king who is not just must be destroyed. Similarly the moral universe of the Tamils depicted in Muppal, is based on the Tamil cultural practice already developed in early Tamil texts, and not a code imposed from above in the typical pattern of the Dharm ashastra 191 . More important is the way by which the Sramanic traditions, including Buddhism, Jainism, and that of Ajivikas were rendered into Tamil, and made part of the linguistic and material culture of the Tamils192. It is the moral economy envisioned by scholars and poets influenced by the Sramanic tradition that provided the foundation of the political authority emerging in the river valleys.Cilappatikaram, with Jaina sympathies was probably authored by a junior Chera chief and Buddhism was patronized by the Cholas.mNaladi nanuru, a Jaina text belonging to the kilkannkku collection, was probably composed under Muttarayar, the chiefs of Kaveri basin194. Early Tontai (Paliava) rulers ''*also patronised Buddhism and were probably responsible for the Buddhist monuments at Kanci. Sramana influence over the Paliavas continued up to the period of Mahendra varman, when the Sramana orders declined under</page><page sequence="15">General President 's Address 37 the impact of Saivism.,% Numerous Buddhist and Jaina centers in the east Coast and Madurai have also been attested to. 197 They were built by the gifts made by merchants and chiefs, already indicated by the Tamil Brahmi labels. It is probably this Sramana influence that gave rise to the story of the kaliyarasar mentioned in the Velvikkuti inscription of Pandya Neduncadaiyan (7,h century CE),y' These were probably groups that migrated from Karnataka and Andhra the region of the northerners or vadukar. The Buddhist reference to Accula Vikkanta, who patronized Buddhist monks and scholars, also shows up this influence. All this shows that instead of talking about a 'kalabhra period', we may have to talk about a transitional phase, when external migrants, mainly Sramanas and Brahmanas intervened in the material and cultural processes in the Tamil region.1''9 This shows that the image of the chief as conqueror and destroyer that gave rise to the political territories was being complemented by the image of the chief as protector of the emerging moral economy. The combination of these two functions of the king, and the growth of functionaries who executed these functions as the will of the chief would give rise to the early state in the Tamil society. However, the rise of the chief as conqueror/ protector did not result in the integration of the linguistic and cultural space of Tamils. The problem was compounded possibly by political interventions from the north by the emerging kingdoms of Deccan.200 This was achieved when Tamil country began to be conceived as a divine landscape, and a deity who was conceived as the protector of the entire landscape inhabited by the Tamils. A noted earlier, the attempt to demarcate the elite Sentami I lands from the lands where vulgar Tamil was spoken was already taking place. Now the effort was to identify the linguistic core area as a divine landscape inhabited by the pure Tamil under the protection of their deity. It is also possible that the entire story of the three sangams was a narrative developed as a ruse to establish the credibility of Madurai as the essential tamilnilax and the Pandya patronage of the Tamil cankam would become the Pandyan patronage of Tamil as such201. The concept of a divinity as spatial protector already exists in Tolkappiyam. where different deities are mentioned as divinities of the tinai geographies. However, the divinities have no specific residence, and they are believed to be pervading (meyinra) the entire geography.202 Murukan is the deity pervading kurinci tinai. The depiction of murukan in the later Tirumurukarrupatai is completely different203. The form of the spirit worship revealed in the early Tamils songs is replaced by the worship of an anthropomorphic deity, who is mentioned as the son of Siva204. He is also made the son of Korravai, the early Tamil goddess of conquest and victory205. He was supposed to reside in six pataiveedus ( camp-sites). They are Tiruppuramkunram (to the West of Madurai), Tirucchendur or Tiruchiralaivay (in the Southeast coast), Tiruvavinaankuti (Palani in Dindigul District), Tiruverakam (kaveri delta), Palamuticholai (Alakarmalai), and kunrutoratal (Tiruttani)206. The location of the six pataiveedus of murukan marks the territory that included the kaveri and vaigai river basins and the south East coast, extending upto Tiruttani in the north, with Western border, being the Palani hills. Thus the entire Konku region (Salem, Erode and Coimbatore districts of Tamilnadu) and the western lands have been completely left out. Thus the divine landscape of the six pataiveedus of murugan thus pervaded the territory of the three emerging kingdoms of Pandyas, Muttarayar succeeded by the Cholas and the Paliavas, and at.thc same time was confined to the conventional Tamil linguistic territory of venkatam to kumari. It can also be seen that the landscape corresponds broadly to the SentamiX land In between Kaveri and Vaigai rivers. A few more territories were included, creating a landscape from Tiruttani to Tiruccendur and from kaveri delta to Palani. This landscape was to become the centre of the political and socio-cultural transformation of the Tamils in the later centuries. The significance of the six pataiveedus of Murukan and their landscape is that it reorganizes the Tamil linguistic and cultural region on a new basis. The multiple geographies</page><page sequence="16">38 l HC: Proceedings, 74th Session, 20 1 3 and economies of the early historic Tamil region get replaced by the eastern coastal plain that forms the landscape of Tirumurukarrupatai. The coastal plain is bordered by the highlands of the Western and Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. Thus the riversides littoral becomes the central s geographical space of the new landscape, and paddy agriculture becomes the central livelihood form and the vellala landholders emerge as the major landowning class to which Brahmanas who received land grants from the emerging chiefs come to be added. Other livelihood patterns that were part of the earlier Tinai geographies became peripheral, and it became imperative on the rulers of the river valleys conduct raids on the bordering regions mobilize additional resources. The political authority of such region should have both the means of controlling and regulating agricultural production. Chiefs do not simply collect tirai and control resources and people, but control land as the resource and means of production as well as the people who are the producers207. The role of the protector becomes the role of the sovereign (Ko and koman )208. Sovereignty becomes legitimized through invoking the divine as the almighty, who becomes the protector of the sovereignty as well as the land*w. Thus the political territory of the Paliava and Pandya chiefs became the hegemonic landscapes of the emerging state, legitimized by the divine. The hegemonic landscape also ensured the legitimation of the emerging division between the non-producing and producing -distributing classes and facilitated the introduction of 'Puranic religion" and Brahmanic ideology as powerful stabilizing forces.210 It also incorporated the classical Tamil language and literature in its organized, pure form and developed it as part of the emerging court culture .The dominance of Tamil language oral and written and inscribed forms ensured that the emerging landscape will be a Tamil landscape. The original linguistic community built upon the confluence of spatial and temporal dimensions, material culture and linguistic expressions was replaced by the embeddedness of the 'perfect' Tamil language on the hegemonic landscape of the divine and the profane. Such a landscape also removed all the kotuntamil forms and regions where such forms continued to exist, including the people of the Western Ghats and the West Coast. However, these regions were subject to raids and conquest by the sovereigns of the East, Pandyas, Paliavas and later the Cholas. Cheras, who were originally part of the linguistic and political territory, were also excluded from the landscape and developed in a different direction forming a landscape of their own. Others continued a peripheral, marginal existence, destined to be absorbed as the labour force in the hegemonic landscape or retaining their tribal characteristics, being called ' Adivasis' in later literature. The argument so far developed can be summed up as follows. During the first millennium BCE, the people who built the Iron Age megalithic burials in different parts of South India were also interacting among themselves through processes of booty capture, warfare over resources and products, exchange and cultural communication. In the region referred to as tamilakam (which is here referred to as the Tamil country), multiple economies and livelihood patterns existed, this came to be expressed as the tinai geographies. The processes of cultural interaction resulted in a common linguistic form that came to be called Tamil. The linguistic form itself may have had similarities with some other languages in India and elsewhere now referred to as Dravidian languages. The embedded character of the linguistic form on the Tinai geographies and the development of a corresponding linguistic expressions, codified in texts like Tolkappiyam provided it with a cultural distinctiveness not shared by others who spoke a similar language, and thus a Tamil linguistic community was born. Warfare, internal and external migrations and expansion and diversification of forms of production and exchange resulted in the growth of an exchange economy in which people following different livelihood patterns participated, and which also facilitated further migrations as well as internal and external trade. Chiefs who developed through booty capture and warfare began to carve out political territories within the linguistic region, and some were also involved in interaction and warfare with chiefs in the non-Tamil region also.</page><page sequence="17">General President 's Address 3 9 Some of these chiefs, who could control maximum resources, came to be recognized as conquerors and victors ( Vendons ). Carving out such political territories necessitated the reorganization the original linguistic and cultural region. New and sustainable resource bases had to be found, which was located in the wetland paddy cultivation around important rivers like kaveri, vaigai, Tamraparni, and Palar. As the coastal plains around these rivers came under cultivation on a large scale, new regular resources could be produced that would sustain landowning and trading class, the vellalar and vanikav. They also enabled the growth of sovereign political power s around the river valleys such as kaveri and vaigai for a longer period. The sovereign power would need a social organization to sustain its hegemony, which was provided by the moral economy, bequeathed by scholars and poets of Sramanic inspiration which was developed by the Brahmanas. They also developed a new purified Tamil language (sentamil) that would be distinct from the vulgar Tamil forms. Thus a Sentam i' land was born, with its linguistic and cultural specificities. A sacred landscape with the earlier spirit deity Murukan, Siva and victory goddess Korravai at the centre was also developed to provide divine legitimacy to the emerging landscape. The concept of landscape became the hegemonic Tamil region, which also could sustain a sovereign ruler, both culturally and materially. It is difficult to map these processes on a chronological basis. Suffice it to say that the changes took place over a millenium from the middle of the first millennium BCE to the middle of the first millenium CE. Nor did the Tamil regional map remain stable throughout the period. The fuzzy borders of the region that was emerging during the first millennium BCE more or less acquired stability during the next millennium around the river valleys of the present Tamilnad. Later, the Bhakti movement and the growth of new forms of land relations and caste divisions would alter social and political processes substantially. But they were all built on the powerful foundations of a hegemonic Tamil cultural landscape, and early Tamil bardic poems were preserved to provide a poetic genealogy for this landscape.

Iruyanar Ahapponil, composed probably in 1 1 *-1 2* century, and Thiruvilayudal pu rana m , composed probably in 1 3* century, narrate the story of the three Sangams and the submergence of the part of the tamil land under the sea. The story has been revived in a big way by tamil, scholars like M.P.Sivagnanam, and M.S.Pumalingam Pillai and recently the narrative has been 'interpreted' in terms of the theory of plate tectonics and the movement of the so-called Gondwanaland or Lemuria,. The story of the three Cankains, is believed by such scholars to portray an indigenous past for the Tamilians, a hallmark of Tamil identity.

An argument t the contrary has been made by Herman Tieken, who has suggested a later date for the composition of the Sangam poetry. Herman Tieken, Kavya in South India: Old Tamil Cankam /Wr^, Groningen, Edgbert Forsten, 200 1 . However, Tieken 's argument may be valid in so far as the compiltion of the poems, as the compilers like Peruntevanar have been given a later date, and not on the compoisitions themselves, which, like any oral composition, are not easily datable .Further, there is always the possibility that tlie the poems could still depict the social formation from the period of their composition to their compilation.

Argument has been advanced for the diffusion of megalithic culture from beyond the Hindu kush, Thus contacts with West Asia. Also, rock cut passage-passage porthole chambers that cover most of the laterite beds of Kerala were 'local adaptations of th models reached by the sea probably from Ethiopia that has parallels for the types'( Rajan Gurukkal and Raghava Varier, Cultural History of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram,1999 p. 124. 66. Leshnik Op.Cit , has argued that the authors of the megaliths were nomadic pastoralists.However, the forms of labour and technology required for building the megaliths would suggest a semi-sedentary population, but without the concept of a territory. Increase in population and diversification of labour processes, for example, potmaking, iron tools and mat could also facilitate and search for resources and settlement adjacent to resource he regions. Leshnik himself approvingly uses the identification by fergusson and Walhouse that the megaliths were created by Kurumbas( Leshnik, p.l44,93).However, the ethnoarchaeology of the movement and settlement of kurumbas( or kurumas) have not been worked out. 67.

Stratification appears in the construction of the burials , from pit to multiple chamber burials, and the distribution of grave goods within the burial type. Geographical variation appears in the resources used in the production of grave goods or structures, as in the case of the use of laterite in Kerala or the choice of clay for potmaking. 70.

Maps prepared by the Historical Atlas of South India project, French Institute , Pondichery, show the predominance of distribution of megalithic burials along the Western Ghtas and te hillsolps and table lands surrounding them.

Vatukar were speaking a crude language(Aa/;fa neenmozhi) 82. This is seen in the use of turais( called by Kailasapathy as 'themes' but look more like poetic entry points) inearly tamil poems, where this form of interplay between real and literary spatialities take place.

AN 181 refers to Juan Murai mutunul 'the concealed old knowledge' of the Brahman as. 88. The indigenization has been attempted to be interpreted on the basis of archaeological evidence by K. Rajan,' Situating the early Historical Times in Tamilanadu: Some issues and reflections'. Social Scientist Vol.36, 1-2, 2008. 89. This is shown in the distinction between Akappeyar and purappeyar prescribed in Tolkappiyam Porulatikaram. Thus the sutra in Akattinaiiya'$l forbids the names beyond the general names in A kam songs and also Sutra 58 also states that proper nouns of purattinai should not be used in akattinai. Thus the transition from common to proper nouns would signify the transition from a narrative to recording an event, be it space, time, resources, or fonns of human practice.

Y.Subbarayalu, Visaki and Kuviran: Historical implications of names in Tamil-Brahmi Inscriptions' K.Indrapala(ed), Early Historic tamilnadn , Chennai,2009,pp 95-122. Subbarayalu points to the existence of Prakrit speakers, some of them from Srilanka, among those who inscribed tha names on potery or in caves. The names in sangam literature shows more standardization , which may be the result of more scholarly attempts those who compiled the anthologies. However, it may also show the process of indigenization of the Prakrit speaking people. 91 . It has been argued that the system of inscribing involved the non-traditional rights and privileges in thee society for validation( Rajan Gurukkal, Writing, Literacy and Social formations, Op.Cit). The use of the Brahmi script is related also related to the state formation during the early Historic period ( K. Rajan, Damili Graditi and Cave rcords: The Brahmi Script in Tamilnadu' K.Indrapala, 0/?.c/7,pp.57-94. Limitation of writing to names and deeds appear to be an effort to preserve traditions of individual acts of benediction or valour, different from group practice. This process of indivuation might have been creation of migrants, including prakrit speakers, and indicated the breakup of tribal identity. 92. K.Sivathamby has argued that such a process might have place in the Tamil country indicating the process of social formation during the periods in which the Sangam songs were composed and the period in which the songs were compiled.

Other tenus are also used such as Er( kuttuvar Er), meymarai(puzhiyar mevmarai) cf. PP.IX, 1 0,LI.25- 30 124. PP.VII.8.1-4;VIII, 4,2-5. 125. PP.11, 5, 16-24. 126. PP.IX, 10,25-30 127.

One example is the reference to kosar, who are coming from a place that spoke another language and their settlement is called a niyamam(Ms 90). The tenu is the same as nigama, trade settlement found in other parts of India.( Mahadevan Op.Cit 3.2(Mangulam)) see also pp 548-9) 132. For a discussion of the early contacts, R.Chempakalakshini, Trade, ideology and Urbanisation, pp. 1 1 4-7 133. Although Panini does not mention any region to the south of Kalinga, Katyayana, (c.4* century BC) speaks about Chola and Pandya. K-KPiHay, Social History of the Tamils , University of Madras, 1973, p. 1 19. 1 34. K.Rajan, on the basis of kodumanal evidence, has strongly argued that the Brahmi inscriptions go back to pre-Asokan times(( K.Rajan, Situating early Historical times, pp.23-9. He also discusses the possibility of Prakrit speakers taking Brahmi script to Srilanks and the possibility of script migrationg from Srilanka. Recent discoveries from Kodumanal possibly substantiates such migrations from the North.( K.Rajan and V.P.yathees Kumar, New evidence on scientific dating ofTamil Brahmi script as revealed in Kodumanal and Porunthal excavations, Pragdhara , No.2l-22,20l3,Pp.278-295), Rajan has suggested that dates for Tamiil Brahmi script should be taken back to 5Ul century BC.Although this argument is worth serious consideration, it does not offset the general argument that the Tamil south carne under frequent and regular contact with the northerners from the latter half of first millennium BC 1 35. One indication of this prevalence of Sramanas could be the references to the term pali (palli-hermitage) in Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. The temi already occurs frequently in the inscriptions catalogued by Mahadevan among the early inscriptions (Mahadevan Op.Cit , Nos 1,2,10,15,34,52.). A comparable Brahmanical term does not occur in the inscriptions of the same period. Indigenisation is shown by the use ofTamil in the labels. 1 36. Apart from the reference to the sacrifices indicated earlier, there is reference to 'rappirappalat (twice born) and muihee( three sacrificial fires) PN, 367. PN224 refers to the Vedic sacrifice and the fire emanating from the yupa, again demonstrating the dominant function of the Brahmana..PN 166 refers to Punjattur Parppan kauniyan Vinnan Tayan,. Avur Mulankilar, the poet, also mentions Vedic sacrifices. 137.

There are 22 songs in the sangain texts referring to Tondi, which the author of Periplus describes as a 'fishing village', whereas there are* only seven songs addressing Mucin, and they do not consistently show that Mucin was occupied by the Cheras. 146.

The references by Kosmas Indikopleustus on the Christian settlements in the West Coast appear after the decline(535AD).There were also Christian migrations from West Asia, led by Thomas of Cana, and by Mar Sapor and Mar Prot. Evidence for jews and Arabs also appear after 4"' century. Rajan Gurukkal and Ragliava Varier, Cultural History of Kerala, pp268-9 149.. According to the colophon, Sirupanarrupatai(hereafter SAP) has been sung by Idakkazhinattu Nallur Nathathanar and addressed to the chief Nalliyakkotan of Oymanatu, who held the nakaram of Mavilankai. It is part of the ten songs (pattupattu) believed to have been composed later than the bardic songs of ettutokai. 150. SAP li. 78-82 151 .

The seven chiefs are Pekan( Avivar peruinakan perunkal natan Pekan), Pari (parampil koman), kari (called Malaiyainan tirumudikari in other texts), Ay, Atikan (probably atikaman), Nalli (naiimalai natan) and Ori. The list appears to be an assortment of chiefs, probably a matter of literary convention rather than signifying an actual chronological consonance. However, the convention helps us to understand the extent of the Tamil political territory. Katai ezhuvallal appears in the colophon. 1 55. AN56 describes Nedunceliyan as defeating cerai, cempiyan(Cholan), Titiyan, Elini, Erumeyuran,Irunkovel and Porunan. However, the purpose of the battle is not clear, nor the way in which the chief fought so many enemies (including Erumeyuran and Irunkovel coming from a distance, probably Karnataka region) in one battlefield. .Similarly PN 66 refers to the defeat of the other ventans and the vatakkirikkal of one of them(Chera?). Again the context is not clear, even from literary conventions. 156. PN 24,76. Ritualisation of warfare is shown by the convention of the chief having to defeat seven enemies, which was supposed to have been done by netunjeliyan,Imayavarainban netuncheralatan, Narmudicheral, Cenkuttuvan and Atiyaman Anci(Kailasapathy, Op.Cit, p.226). Not to be outdone, Karikalvalavan defeated eleven at Venni(Narrated in Porunararnipatai) 1 57. The heroic exploits of Tinunavalavan( identified with karikalvalavan), the chola king, as sung in Pattinappalai bu Uruttiran kannanar, has the character of a digvijaya. 158. The poet also belonged to another nadu, Idakkazhinadu, showing that nadu terminology had come into parlance. ' 59. Tamizhnilai perra tankam marapin Makizhnanai marukin maturai (SAP66-7) 160.

Several Tamil poets have Brahamanical Gothra names, such as Kaushikanar, Palai Gauthamanar, and markandeyanar and there is reference to Kauniyan(Kaundinya Gothra). Others have clear Srainanic names, like Ilampotiyar. Many od the poems in the Kilkanakku set of poems , as pointed out earlier, have been clearly composed under Sramanic influence, including Kural and naiadi nantira. 177.

PP VII, VIU, IX provide examples for Celvakatunko, perunceral and Ilaceral being addressed with these epithets. 180. Tolkappiyam , Porulatikaram, 76.77. 181. The colophon for Celvakatunko states: Natupathi patuttu nannarotti Veruveru tnaiytu ceruppala katantu h'thal chanra i tanu te velvi Akkiya pozhuiin arathurai poki Thus Celvakatunko is not only credited with driving away enemies, but building his own territory(natu), conducting sacrifices and administering justice(aram),PP VI I, pat i kam. 182. Muppal, famous as Tirukkural to the Tamil people, is a kilkanakku text , and contains three parts dealing with aram( ethics or law), /wrul(wealth) and lnpam('o'e). There are several commentaries to Muppal, the famous being that of Parimelalagar.There are several contemporary evaluative works on kural available. For example, M.Varadarajan,7i/rva//t/var, allathu vazhkai vilakkam , Chennai, 1979, V.S.Manikkam , Valluvam , 1953,1976. For a social critique, S.Ramakrishnan, Tirukkural, oru samuthaya parva i , Madurai, 1980. 183. S.Ramakrishnan///&gt;/i/, Chapter IV), points to the significance of Oozh in Muppal. Oozh is a principle roughly equivalent to karma, which is both the capacity for labour as well as the moral principle, guiding human activity and leads to social stratification 1 84. Naiadi nanuru also deals only with the three Aram, Inpam and Poru' and excludes deliverance. It, however, goes into a detailed classification of the different forms, and is much more a prescriptive text.. 1 85.

Arunachalam, The Kalahhras in the Pandya country, University of madras, 1979. 1 99. It should also be noted that evidence regarding the Kalabhras are limited to the Chola and Pandya territories, which were emerging as the core of the sentami! lands. See the evidence collected by M. Arunachalam, Language and Religion of the Kalabhras, in Kalahhras in The Pandya Country, University of Madras, 1979.. The evidence appears fom Tondainadu, Cholanadu and Pandya country, which formed part of the territory of the Pataiveedus. 200. This is shown by the imagery of the vatukar, and later kaliyarasar, mentioned earlier. Commentaries of Tolkappiyam identify the vatukar more clearly as telungar, kanikar and karunatax. The 1 1 Ü1 century linguistic text, Yapperunkalavirutti also compares the linguistic expressions of telugu with tamil, showing the clear distinction between linguistic regions. For an early discussion, M.Raghava Iyengar Tamilarum andhirarum, Araycci Tokuti, Op.Cit, pp.3 11-338 201 . It is possible that the entire story of the three sangams was unknown to the singers of the bardic tradition, and was possibly created in later centuries, particularly from the time of the Pandyas of 6lh-7,h centuries. Iriyanar Akapporul and Tinivilaiyadal puranam are later works that emerged from the Pandyan region and Adiyarkku Nallar, author who discusses the story again comes from the same region. Kalittogai and Cilappatikaram provide indications of the submergence of the Pandyan territory, but both cannot be dated before 6*-7* centuries AD, and there is no authentic tradition within bardic poets supporting this. There is a reference in the Srilankan text Rajavaliyam to a submergence during the time of the king Elela, and it is possible the story might have migrated from srilanka, but that does not again mention the three sangams. References in the Velvikkudi grant and larger and smaller Sinnamanur plates clearly show that the Pandyas tried to establish their genealogy from the Sangam Pandya chiefs, and this effort might have led them to incorporate the story of the submergence. (See K. A.Nilakantha Shastri, Pandyan Kingdom , London, Luzac &amp; CO, 1929 passi m.)Hence, the story can be conceived as a mythical narrative supporting the claims of the Pandya chiefs as the patron of Tamilnilai and the territory around Madurai as the Sentamil land. It has, however been argued that the story of the three Sangams is the work of the Saivite tradition as persons of the Saivite tradititon appear in the names listed for the Sangams.(K.Sivathamby, Tamizhil Ilakkiya Varalaru pp. 5 8-9) it is possible that Saivite tradition did influence the myth, as Iraiyanar of Iraiyanar Akapporul was Siva, but the myth in itself glorifies the Pandyas and legitimizes the Pandyan authority over Tamilnilai. 202. Tolkappiyam , Akattinai Iyal,5 203. Tirumurukarrupadai(hereafterTMP), composed by Nakkeerar, the son of Kanakkayanar, is a curious arrupadai song addressed to a deity and not a chief. Its later date is beyond doubt, but it is sometimes called a 'devotional'(kaikkilai) song, but the purpose of including this in a collection which does not have any other devotional songs need clarification. 204.

For a discussion of the pataiveedus R.Chempakalakshmi, 'Secred geography of the Murugan Cult' in Religion, Tradition pp. 197-211. 207 . A typical description is the conquest of Kazhumalam by Chenganan(one of the late sangam cholas) described by Poykayar in Kalavali Nar padu, a Kilkanakku poem. 208. Pandya king koccadaiyan Ranadhira, assumed the title Kongarkoman,( Shastri, Pandyan Kingdom, PP.55). The title, with the prefix ko- already used by some sangam chiefs appears to signify sovereignty. 209. Throughout TMP, Murugan is never addressed as ko or koman, although other titles such as thalaivan , neduvel, and Iravalan are used. There is a clear distinction between profane earthly sovereignty and sacred authority wielded by Murugan. 210. R.
