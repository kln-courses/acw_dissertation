<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 60 ) MATERIALS FOR A STUDY OF TATU IN BORNEO. By CHARLES HOSE, Sc.D., AND R. SHELFORD, M.A., F.L.S. [WITH PLATES VI-XII .] THE great diversity of tribes in Borneo involves, in a study of their tatu and tatuing methods, a good deal of research and much travel if first hand information on the subject is to be obtained. Between us we have covered considerable area in Borneo and have closely cross-questioned members of nearly every tribe inhabiting Sarawak on their tatu, but we cannot claim to have exhausted the subject by any means; there are many tribes in the interior of Dutch Borneo and in British North Borneo whom we have not visited and concerning whom our knowledge is of the scantiest. Our object in preparing this paper has been to place on record all our own observations, the result of some years' work, and to summarise briefly all that has been written on the same subject by other authors. We must leave it to future workers to fill in the blanks still left in our knowledge and to produce a complete monograph of Bornean tatu, only pointing out that if the work is to be done "'twere well it were done quickly." As we shall have occasioni to show later on, there are tribes now existing who have already given up the practice of tatu, there are others who are renouncing their old designs in favour of those formerly peculiar to the Kayans only; whilst finally, though the native tribes of Borneo run small risk of extermination at the hands of the European rulers of the islanid, there is no doubt buit that the dominant and aggressive Sea Dayak is a ruthless destroyer of tribes, which, owing to an inherent and fatal weakness are already tottering to the verge of extinction. It is at least unfortunate that under the aegis of European protection such weakly tribes soon lose all originality in their art and are fain to copy the art and culture of tribes that they cannot fail to regard as more successful in the struggle for life than themselves. At the end of the paper we give a bibliography of Bornean tatu and would draw special attention to the works of Dr. A. W. Nieuwenhuis, since we have found his accounts of tatu most accurate and helpful. It is, however, a pity that Dutch authors still persist in misusing the term Dayak; Dr. Nieuwenhuis is far too competent an ethnologist to think of confusing such different tribes as the Sea Dayaks (or Iban of Dr. Haddon) with Kenyahs or Kayans, yet evell he writes of the " Baritu Dayaks,"' the "Ulu Ajar Dayaks" of the Mandai River, and occasionally of " Kayan Dayaks." It is perhaps advisable to give at the ouitset of this paper the briefest possible sketch of our theory of classification of the Borneans. The people whom we regard as the first immigrants to Borneo we teim Kalaniantan, typically a dolichocephalic</page><page sequence="2">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materialsfor a Study of Tatu in Bornqteo. 61 race of Indonesians; at present they form a number of tribes and we suppose that they slowly filtered into Borneo in the remote past from various souirces, but principally frormi the continent of Asia. When the counltry was occupied by the Kalarnantan, there followed an immigration of Kenyalbs, who mixed to a large extent with their Indoiiesian predecessors, so that at the present day it is a matter of the greatest difficulty to determine whether certain tribes are Kalamantan or Kenvah; to obviate the difficulty we term suich tribes Kenyah-Kalamantan. It is not probable that the Kenyahs arrived all at once but rather it is likely that their immigration was spread over a considerable period of years, the main lines of invasion running up the principal rivers of eastern and south-eastern Borneo. At some period-say one huindred years-after the last of the Kenyah immigrations, there followed up the same rivers the Kayan race, who are characterised by a low brachycephaly. By this time the Kalamantan tribes, which had not amalgamnated with the Kenyahs, had been driven towards the head waters of the miiain rivers and the new pressure from without forced them still further iinland. The Kenvah fared better at the hands of the new arrivals anid initer- marriage douibtless frequently occurred, with the resuilt that many Kenyah tribes of to-day are, superficially at any rate, extremely like the Kayans. These Kenyahs and the Kayans we bracket together under a third heading-Kenyah-Kayan. The wave of immigration still continiuing to flow in from the east, the Kenyahs and Kayains swept over the great watershed of Borneo between Sarawak and Dutch Borlneo and down the Rejang aild Baram Rivers of Sarawak. Last of all came the Sea Dayak, a brachycephalic Malayan; advancing up the Kapuas fronm the south-west he drove all before him and overflowed into the Batang Llupar and adjacent rivers of Sarawak, where to this day he remains in great force. Within quite recent years the Sea Dayaks have migrated also from the Batang Lupar ntp the Rejang and the Baram Rivers driving back the Kenyahs and Kayans who had moved down into those districts from the interior. At the present day the following features in the distribution of the tribes are salient :-In British North Borneo anld in the extreme west of Sarawak the tribes are without exception Kalamantan; in these two parts of the island there are no great rivers, and this geographical feature seems to have afforded shelter to the present inhabitants of these areas, for the great waves of immigration must have flowed up the great rivers of Borneo, not up the small ones. The other ICalamantan tribes are scattered throughout the rest of Borneo, but for the most part are situated in the interior highlands watered by the upper tributaries of the large rivers; the Kalamantans nearer the coast and on the coast, such as the Milanos, are, to use a geological term, outliers that still stand up clear from the surrounding strata of a later age. Such are the Sru, the only Kalamantans in the Sea L)ayak head- quarters, the Tanjong of the Rejang river, the Narom and Miri from niear the mouth of the Baram river, anid many others which could be cited.' I No doubt somne of these tribes have been driven over t he watershed of Borneo and down the Sarawak rivers by the Kenyah-Kayan advance,</page><page sequence="3">62 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a S3tudy of Tatu in Borneo. Between the interior highlands occupied by the Kalamantans and the sea, lie the Kenyah and the Kayan tribes, the former as a rule ntearer the head waters than the latter, but these tribes in turn have been pushed up-country in the Baram and Rejang Rivers and to a certaini extent in the Kapuas river by the Sea T)ayak. It is not so long ago that there were no Sea Dayaks in the Rejang and Baram, but now in the former river there are none but Sea Dayaks for 150 nmiles and more from the river mouth, whilst in the latter the Sea lDayak is encroaching more and more uipon the Kayan-Kenyah donmains. The following table expresses our ideas of classification more succinctly: I. Kalamnantan ... ... Typically dolichocephalic N.E. Borneo, W. Borneo, interior Indonesians. highlands, " outliers." II.

Other systemis of classificatiorL have been published by Dr. A. C. Haddon' and by Dr. J. H. F. Kohlbriigge and Dr. A. Nieuwenhuis.2 Dr. Nieuwenhuis has also communicated to us by letter his later views on the subject. It is of interest to find that the systems coincide to a great extent, such differenices as occur being differences of minor importance. The following table illustrates this: Hose and Shelford.

Dr. Kohlbriiuoe compares the Puinan and Kayans to the Javanese, the Ulu Ajar to the dolichocephalic Indonesians of the mountain regions of Java (Tenogerese); whilst Dr. Nieuwenhuis places the former in a class distinct from the Kayans on ethnographical grounds. The Ot Danum and Ulu Ajar are merely Kalaiinantans of a certain area. As no Sea Dayaks were measured by Dr. Nieuwenhuis during the course of his travels, they do not enter into his scheme of classification of 1903, nor into that of Dr. Kohlbruigge, who studied only the actual measurements taken by the Dutch savant. In brief, all the five schemes recognise a dolichocephalic race of Indo- nesians, a brachycephalic race of Malayans or Proto-Malays, and intermediate tribes, over whose exact position we must continue to arguie until further material for study is to halnd. The practice of tatu is so widely spread throughout Borneo that it seems simpler to give a list of the tribes that do not tatu, than of those who do. We can divide such a list into two sections; the first including, those tribes that originally did not tatu, though nowadays many individuals are met with whose bodies are decorated with desig,ns copied from neighbouring tribes; the second including the tribes that have given up the practice of tatu owing to contact with Mubammadan and other influences.

The patterns once employed by the tribes included in the second section of this list are lost beyond recall, and most of the tribes have adopted Malay dress and to some extent Malay customs. The Land Dayaks display absolute ignorance of tatu, and aver that they never indulged in the practice; Maloh and Punan men ornamented with Kayan tatu designs we have often encountered, but they have</page><page sequence="5">64 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for- a Studqy of Tatv in Borneo. no designs of their own and attach no special significance to their borrowed designs.1 We may note here that the orniamentation of the body by meanis of raised scars and keloids is not knownl in Borneo. Both men and women of several tribes will test their bravery and indifference to pain by setting fire to a row of small pieces of tinder placed along the forearm, and the scars caused by these burns are often permanent, but should not be mistaken for decorative designs. Carl Bock (2, Plate 16)2 figures some Punan women with rows of keloids on the forearms, but states (p. 71) that these are due to a form of vaccination practised by these people. The Kayans are, with one or two exceptions, the most tatued race in Borneo, and perhaps the best tatued from an artistic point of view; the designs used in the tatu of the men have been widely imlitated and much ceremonial is connected with the tatu of the women, an account of which we give below. Generally speaking, the truie Kalamantain designs are quite simple, anid it is noteworthy that although the Kenyah tribes most nearly akin to Kayan tribes lhave borrowed tile Kayan tatu patterns, the mnajority of Kenyah-Kalainantan tribes employ quiite simple designs, whilst the prinmitive Kenyahs of the Batang Kayan River hardly tatu at all. A remarkable exception to the general simiiplicity of the Kalamantan patterns is furnished by the Ukits, Bakatan, and Biadjau, who tatu very extensively in the most complex designs; the Long Utan, an extinct tribe, probably of Kalamantan stock, also used hiighly decorative and complex designs. Since so many tribes owe much of their knowledge of tatu and the majority of their designs to the Kayans, it will be well to coinmence with an account of the art of tatu as practised by these people. i. Kayan tatu. Dr. Nieuwenhuis [9, p. 450] agrees with us in stating that amongst these people, the men tatu chiefly for ornament, alnd that no special significance is attached to the majority of designs employed; nor is there any particular ceremonial or tatu coninected with the process of tatuing the male sex. There is no fixed time of life at which a man can be tatued, but in most cases the practice is begun early in boyhood. Nieuwenhuis [9, p. 456] remarks that the chiefs of the Mendalam Kayans scarcely tatu at all. Amongst the Sarawak Kayans, if a man has taken the head of an enemy he can have the backs of his hands and fingers covered with tatu (Plate XI, Fig. 1), but if he has only had a share in the slaughter, one finger only, and that generally the thuinb, can be tatued. On the Mendalam River, the Kayan braves are tatued on the left thumb only, not on the carpals and backs of the fingers, and the thigh pattern is also reserved for head-taking heroes [9, p. 456]. I Nieuwenh-Lis also notes (9, p. 451) that mnen in the course of their travels amongst other tribes permit themselves to be tatued with the patterns in vogue with their hosts. 2 These figures refer to the bibliography given on p. 88.</page><page sequence="6">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Aaterials for a Study of Tatn in Borneo. 6 Of the origin of tatu the Kayans relate the following story :-Long ago when the plumage of birds was dull and sober, the coucal (Centropus sinensis) and the argus pheasant (Argusianus grayi) agreed to tatu each other; the coucal began on the pheasant first, and succeeded admirably as the plumage of the pheasant bears witness at the present day; the pheasant then tried his hand on the coucal, but being a stupid bird he was soon in difficulties, and, observing that he would fail miserably to complete the task, he took the black dye and, having smeared it all over his friend, told him to sit in a bowl of samakc tan, and, when the coucal did as he was told, flew off remarking that the country was full of enemies, and, therefore, he could not stop; and that is why the coucal to this day has a black head and neck with a tan-coloured body. Nieuwenhuis [9, p. 456] relates substantially the same story, the crow (Corone macrorhyndyus), however, being substituted for the coucal and the incident of the bowl of samak tan omitted. Kayan men have isolated designs tatued on the following parts of the body The outside of the wrist, the flexor surface of the forearm, high up on the outside of the thigh, on the breasts and on the points of the shoulders, and, as already stated, in the case of warriors on the backs of the hands and fingers. It is not an invariable rule, however, that a man should be tatued on all these parts of the body. The design tatued on the wrists (Plate IX, Figs. 8-10) is termned lukcut, i.e., an antique bead much valued by Kayans, and the significance of the designs is of some interest. When a man is ill, it is supposed that his soul has escaped from his body, and when he recovers it is supposed that his soul has returned to him; to prevent its departure oni some future occasion the man will " tie it in " by fastening round his wrist a piece of string on which is threaded a lu/cut1 or antique bead, some magic apparently being considered to reside in the bead. However, the string can get broken and the bead lost, wherefore it seems safer to tatu a representation of the bead on the part of the wrists which it would cover if actually worn. It is of interest also to note that the luckut from having, been a charm to prevent the second escape of the soul has come to be regarded as a charm to ward off all disease, and the same applies to its tatued representation. A design just below the biceps of a Punan tatued in the Kayan manner is shown on Plate XII, Fig. 10, and I was informed by the Punan that this also was a lu/cut, an excellent example of the indifference paid to the significance of design by people with whom such design is not indigenous. On the forearm and thigh the udoh asu or dog pattern is tatued, and four typical examples are shown on Plat-e X, Figs. 1, 2, 5, 6. Nieuwenhuis has figured a series of these designs [9, Plate 82]2 showing a transition from a very elongate animal form to a rosette form; we have never met with the first amongst Sarawak I The Sea Dayaks often employ for the same reason a carpal bone of the mouse-deer (Tragulus). 2 See also Haddon (4, Fig. 2), and Nieuwenhuis (8, Plates XXV and XXVI); the designs figured in the latter work are not very easy to interpret, the lower of the two rosette figures looks as if it was derived from four heads of dogs fused together. See also Ling Roth (7, p. 85). VOL. XXXVI. F</page><page sequence="7">66 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Aaterials for a Study of atan in Borneo. Kayans, but it is a characteristic thigh design amongst the Mendalam Kayans; the forms numbered b and c are unusual in Sarawak. Of the four examples here given-and it may be noted that these met with the high approval of expert tatu artists-Figs. 1, 2 and 5, may be considered as ilntermediate between Nieuwenhuis' very elongate example f and the truncated form e which is supposed to represent the head only of a dog. Fig. 2 is characteristic of the Uma Balubo Kayans, and is remarkable in that teeth are shown in both jaws; whilst, both in this example and in Fig. 5, the eye is represented as a disc, in Figs. 1 and 6 the eye is assuming a rosette-like appearance, which rosette, as Nieuwenhuis' series shows, is destined in some cases to increase in size until it swallows up the rest of the design. Fig. 6 may be compared with Nieuwenhuis, Fig. e, as it evidently represents little more than the head of a dog. Although a single figure of the dog is the most usual form of tatu, we have met with an example of a double figure; it is shown in FIG. 1. Fig. 7; it will be observed that one of the dogs is reversed and the tails of the two figures interlock. Fig. 8 represents a dog with pups, tquang nganak; A is supposed to be the young one. The dog design figures very promineintly in Kayan art, and the fact that the dog is regarded by these people and also by the Kenyahs with a certain degree of veneration may account for its general representation. The design has been copied by a whole host of tribes, with accompanying degradation and change of nanme. On the deltoid region of the shoulders and on the breasts, a rosette or a star design is found (text, Figs. 1 and 2). As already stated, it seems in the highest degree probable that the rosette is derived from the eye in the dog pattern, and it is consequently of some interest to find that the name now given to the rosette pattern is that of the fruit of a FIG. 2. plant, which was introduced into Borneo certainly within the last fifty or sixty years. The plant is Plukenetia corniculata, one of the Euphorbiacae, and it is cultivated as a vegetable; its Kayan name is jalaut. We have here a good example of the gradual degradation of a design leading to a loss of its original significance and even of its name, another name, wvhich originated probably from some fancied resemblance between pattern and object, being applied at a subsequent date. Ipa olim, i.e., open fruit of a species of Mangifera, is another name occasionally applied to the rosette pattern, but jaictut is in more general use (cf. Plate X, Fig. 4, Plate XI, Fig. 7 and Plate'XII, Fig. 9). On Plate XI, Fig. 1, is shown the hand of a Skapan tatued in the Kayan I Of, Hose and McDougall, Journ. Anth. Inst., vol. xxxi, 1901, p. 187,</page><page sequence="8">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Aaterials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. 67 manner by a Kayan; the figures on the phalanges are known as tegulun,' representations of human figures or as silong, faces, and they are evidently anthropomorphic derivatives. The triangles on the carpal knuckles are termed song irang, shoots of bamboo, and the zig-zag lines are ikor, lines. Kayan women are tatued in complicated serial2 designs over the whole forearm, the backs of the hands, over the whole of the thighs and to below the knees, and on the metatarsal surfaces of the feet. The tatuing of a Kayan girl is a serious operation, not only because of the considerable amount of pain caused, but also on account of the elaborate ceremonial attached to this form of body ornamentation. The process is a long one, lasting sometimes as muclh as four years, since only a small piece can be done at a sitting and several long intervals elapse between the various stages of the work. A girl when about ten years old will probably have had her fingers and the upper part of her feet tatued, and about a year later her forearms should have been completed; the thighs are partially tatued during the next year, and in the third or fourth year from the commencement the whole operation should have been accomplished. A woman endeavours to have her tatu finished before she becomes pregnant as it is considered imnmodest to be tatued after she has become a mother. If a woman has a severe illness after any portion of her body has been tatued, the work is not continued for some little time; moreover, according to Nieuwenhuis (9, p. 453), a woman cannot be tatued during seed time nor if a dead person is lying unburied in the house, since it is pemxali to let blood during these occasions; bad dreams, such as a dream of floods, foretelling much blood letting, will also interrupt the work. A tatued woman may not eat the flesh of the monitor lizard or kavok (Varanus spp.) nor the scaly inanis or dn (Manis javanica), and if she happens to have a husband he also is included in the tabu until the pair have a male and a female child. If they have a daughter only they may not eat the flesh of the monitor until their child has been tatued; if they have a son only they cannot eat the monitor until they become grandparents. Should a girl have brothers, but no sisters, some of her tatu lines must not be joined together, but if she has brothers and sisters, or sisters only, all the lines can be joined. Tatu amongst Kayan women is universal, they believe that the designs act as torches in the next world, and that without these to light them they would remain for ever in total darkness; one woinan told Dr. Nieuwenhuis that after death she would be recognised by the impregnation of her bones with the tatu pigment; as 1 In ancient days when a great Kayan or Kalamantan chief built a new house, the first post of it was driven through the body of a slave; this sacrifice to a tutelary deity is no longer offered, but a human figure is frequently carved on the post of a house and may be a relic of the old custom; the figure is called tegulun. Sea Dayak anthropomorphs are termed engkramba and appear in cloths and bead-work designs, also in carvings on boundary marks, witch doctor's baskets, etc. 2 We apply the term serial to those designs in which the uinits of the pattern are repeated, or in which the units follow each other in serial order; the udoh as= on a Kayan man's thigh is an isolated design, but the design on his hands is a serial design.</page><page sequence="9">68 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materialsfor a Study of Tlatmt in Borneo. amongst the Kayans the bones of a deceased person are placed some time after death in a grave, Dr. Nieuwenhuis' informant evidently imagined that her tatu would obviate all risk of the confusion of her remains with another's. The operation of tatuing is performed by women, never by men, and it is always the women who are the experts on the significance and quality of tatu designs, though the men actually carve the designs on the tatu blocks. Nieuwenhuis states (9, p. 452) that the office of tatuer is to a certain extent hereditary and that the artists, like smiths and carvers, are under the protection of a tutelary spirit, who must be propitiated with sacrifices before each operation. As long as the children of the artist are of tender age, she is debarred from the practice of her profession. The greater the number of sacrifices offered, or in other words the greater the experience of the artist, the higher is the fee demanded. She is also debarred from eating certain food. It is supposed that if an artist disregard the prohibitions imposed upon her profession, the designs that she tatus will not appear clearly, and she herself may sicken and die. Sometimes women become tatu artists in order to get cured of a sickness; the priestess, who in Kayan houses is a healer of the sick, as a last resort may advise her patient to place herself under the care of Apu Lagan, the tutelary spirit of tatu artists, by actually becoming a tatu artist. The tools used by a tatu artist are simple,' consisting of two or three prickers, ulany or ulany brang, and an iron striker, tukun or pepak, which are kept in a wooden case, bungan. The prickers are wooden rods with a short pointed head projecting at right angles at one end; to the point of the head is attached a lump of resin in which are embedded three or four short needles, their points alone projecting fromi the resinous mass. The striker is merely a short iron rod, half of which is covered with a string lashing. The pigment is a mixture of soot, water, and sugar-cane juice, and it is kept ill a double shallow cup of wood, nit ulang; it is supposed that the best soot is obtained from the bottom of a mnetal cooking pot, but that derived from burning resin or dammar is also used. The tatu designs are carved in high relief on blocks of wood, kelingJ,2 which are smeared with the ink and then pressed on the part to be tatued, leavinig an imnpressioni of the designs. As will be seen later the designs tatued on women are in longitudinal rows or transverse bands, and the divisions between the rows or bands are marked by one or more zigzag lines termed ikor. The subject who is to be tatued lies on the floor, the artist and an assistant squatting on either side of her3; the artist first dips a piece of fibre from the sugar palm (Arenga saccharifera) into the pigment and, pressing this on to the limb to be tatued, plots out the arrangement of the rows or bands of the design; alonig these straight lines the artist tatus the rows of ikor, then taking a tatu block carved with the required design, she smears it with pigment and presses it on to the limb C Vf. Ling Roth (7, p. 34) and Nieuwenhuis (9, Plate 32). 2 The Sea Dayak word telingai or kelingai has the same meaning. 3 Furness (3, Plate, p. 152), Nieuwenhuis (9, Plate 77).</page><page sequence="10">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materialsfor a Stud,y oj Tatu in Borneo. 69 between two rows of ikor. The tatuer or her assistant stretches with her feet the skin of the part to be tatued, anld, dipping a pricker into the pigment, taps its handle with the striker as she works along a line, driving the needle points into the skin. The operation is painful, and the subject can rarely restrain her cries of anguish, but the artist is always quite unmoved by such demonstrations of woe, and proceeds methodically with her task. As no antiseptic precautions are ever taken, a newly tatued part often ulcerates, much to the detriment of the tatu, but taking all things into consideration it is wonderful how seldom one meets with a tatu pattern spoilt by scar tissue. It is considered bad luck to draw the blood of a frieud (pesu daha) and therefore, when first blood is drawn in tatuing, it is customiary to give a slmlall present to the artist; the present takes the form of four antique beads or sonle object worth about one dollar and is termed lasat mata, for it is supposed that if it were omitted the artist would go blind and some misfortune would happen to the parents and relations of the girl undergoing the operation of tatu. When the half of one ikor has been completed the tatuer stops and asks for selivit; this is a present of a few beads, well-to-do people paying eight yellow beads of the variety known as lavany, valued at one dollar apiece, whilst poor people give two beads. It is supposed that if selivit was not paid the artist would be worried by the dogs and fowls that always roam about a Kayan house, so that the work would not be satisfactorily done; however, to make assurance doubly sure, a curtain is hung round the operator and her subject to keep off unwelcome intruders. After selivit has been paid a cigarette is smoked, aind then work recommences in earnest, there being no further interruptions for the rest of the day except for the purpose of taking food. The food of the artist must be cooked and brought to her, as she mlust inot stop to do other work than tatuing, and her tools are only laid aside for a few miiinutes whilst she consumes a hurried meal. Fowls and pigs are killed for the artist by the parenits of the girl who is being tatued. The fees paid to the artist are more or less fixed; for the forearms a gong, tawak, worth from eight to twenty dollars. according to the workmanship required. is paid; for the thighs a large tawak is paid, wolth as inuch as sixty dollars if the very best workmaniship is demanded, from six to twenity dollars if only inferior workman- ship is required.' For tatuing the fingers the operator receives a parang or short sword, known as kam hing. Nieuwenhuis (8, p. 236) states that it is supposed that the artist will die within a year if her charges are excessive, but we have not met with this belief amongst the Kayans of the Rejang and Baram Rivers. The knee-cap is the last part to be tatued, and before this is touched the artist must be paid; as this part of the design is the keystone, as it were, of the whole, the required fee is always forthcoming. A narrow strip down the back of 1 The prices in the Baram River are much higher than in the Mendalam, where a gong can only be demanded by an artist of twenity years' experience; less experienced artists have to be content with beads and cloth (9, p. 452).</page><page sequence="11">70 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of liatu itn Borneo. the thigh is always left untatued; it is supposed that mortification of the legs would ensue if this strip was not left open. The time at which to begin tatuing a girl is about the ninth day after new moon, this lunar phase being known as butit halap, the belly of the halap fish (Barbus bramoides); as the skin of the girl being tatued quickly becomes very telnder, it is often necessary to stop work for a few days, but it is a matter of indifference at what lunar phase work recommences, so long as it was originally begun at butit halap. A Kayan chief of the Mendalam River informed Dr. Nieuwenhuis [9, p. 455] that in his youth only the wives and daughters of chiefs were permitted the thigh tatu, women of lower rank had to be content with tatu of the lower part of the shin, the ankles and feet. The designs were in the form of quadrangular blotches divided by narrow untatued lines, and were known as tedak danau, lake tatu. The quadrangles were twelve in number, divided from each other by four longitudinal and two transverse untatued lines, 6 millimetres broad, two of the longitudinal lines running down each side of the front of the leg, and two down each side of the calf, approximately equidistant; the forearm was tatued in the same style. This manner of tatu is obsolete now, and Dr. Nieuwenhuis was fortunate in finding one very old woman so tatued. Nowadays the class restrictions as regards tatu are not so closely observed, but it is still possible to distinguish between the designs of a chief's daughter, an ordinary free-woman and a slave, by the number of lines composing the figures of the designs, the fewer these lines, the lower being the rank of the woman. Moreover the designs of the lower-class women are not nearly so complex as those of the higher-class, and they are generally tatued free-hand. A very typical design for the forearm of a woman of high rank is shown on Plate X, Fig. 3; it is taken from a Kayan of the Uma Pliau sub-tribe dwelling on the Baram River, and may be compared with the somewhat similar designs of the Mendalam River Kayans figured by Nieuwenhuis [9, Plate 85] one of which is a design for a chief's daughter, the other for a slave. The zigzag lines bounding the pattern on both surfaces of the forearm are the ikor, i.e., lines, and these, as already stated, are marked out with a piece of fibre dipped in the tatu ink before the rest of the pattern is impressed by a wood-block or klinge'. Taking the flexor surface of the forearm first, the units of the design are:-three bands of concentric circles (A A A) termed beliling bulan or full moons; a triangle (B), each limb formed by several parallel lines, dutlang harok, the bows of a boat; spirals (c c) 'ulu tinggang, the head of the hornbill. On the supinator surface beliling bIlan and ulu tinggang occur again, but instead of dltlang harok, there are two other elements, a bold transverse zigzag known as daun wi (D) bamboo leaves, and at the proximal end of the pattern an inlterlacing design, tushun tuva (E) bundles of tuba root (Derris elliptica). The juice obtained by pounlding up with water the tuba root is used for stuLpefying fish, which are then speared; tuba-fishing is a popular sport amongst all Borneans, and bundles of the dried root are to be found in most houses, kept in readiness for the next occasion. Furness</page><page sequence="12">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. 71 [3, p. 150] suggests that as tuba-fishing is a feminine sport, this may account for the tuba-root design in female tatu, but the suggestion is too wild for seriotis consideration; we give reasons for another origin of the design below (p. 75). The fingers are very simply tatued with a zigzag, on the carpal kiluckles and transverse lines across the joints; the thumb is decorated in a slightly different way. In Dr. Nieuwenhuis' designs cited above, we find much the same elements; in one of them the beliling btiain are more numerous and more closely set together, so that the concentric circles of one set have run into those of the next adjoining, the tushnn tuva pattern is termed poesoeng, evidently the same as tushun, the spirals are niuch degraded in one example and are called krowit, or hooks, whilst in the more elaborate example they are known as manok wak, or eyes of the Scops owl; the pedjakco pattern is an addition, but the meaning of the word is not known; the pattern on the fingers is much more complex than in the Uma Pliau example, and is perhaps a degraded hornbill design. Furness [3, Plate, pp. 148 and 150] figures the armns of Kenyah women of the Baram River; the tatu designs are practically the same as with the Uma Pliau, and are evidently direct copies. Nieuwenhuis [8, Plate XXIV] figures the hand of a low-class woman tatued with triangular and quadranlgular blotches, and with some rude designs that appear to have been worked in free-hand. On Plate X, Fig. 1, is shown the design on the forearm of a high-class woman of the Uma Lekan Kayans of the Batang, Kayan River, Dutch Borneo; in our opinion these elegant designs are quite in the front ranlk of the tatu designs of the world. In spite of the elaboratioln, it is quite possible to distinguish in these, the same elements as in the Unma Pliau specimen, viz.: beliling bulan, ulu tinggang, daun wi and tatshwn tuva, but the dulang harokc is absent. Nieuwenhuis [9, Plate 93, b] figures the arm-tatu (supinator surface only) of a Kayan womian of the Blu-u River, a tributary of the Upper Mahakkam; the mnain design is evidently a hornbill derivative, the knuckles are tatued with quadrangular and rectangular blotclhes. The hornbill plays an important part in the decorative art of the Long Glat, a Kenyah-Kelamantai tribe of the Mahakkam River, and we suspect that, if these Blu-u Kayans are of true Kayan stock, they have borrowed the hornbill design from their neighbours. With regard to the thigh patterns, it is usual to find the back of the thigh occupied with two strips of an intersecting line design, or sormle modification thereof; the sirnplest form is shown on Plate VIII, Fig 1; it is known as ida telo, the three-line pattern, anld is used by slaves; a more elaborate example fromi the Rejang River is shown in Fig. 3, and is used botlh by slaves and free-women. Plate VIII, Fig. 2, and Plate IX, Fig. 6, are termed ida pat, the four-line pattern and are for free-women, Inot for slaves. The latter figure is a combination of ida pat and ida telo. The wives and daughters of chiefs would employ similar designs with the addition of another line, when they are termed ida lima, the five-line patterln, or else a design knownl as ida tuang, the underside pattern, two examples</page><page sequence="13">72 C. HoSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. of which are given on Plate IX, Figs. 1 and 2. If these two latter designs are compared with the hornhill design of the Long Glat, a figure of which, taken from Nieuwenhuis [9, Plate 86] is given (Plate IX, Fig. 3) a certain simiilarity in the motif of the designs can be recognised. It inust be remembered that the Long Glat design is tatued in rows downi the front and sides of the thigh, whilst these Kayan designs have been modified to form more or less of a sinuous line design for the back of the thigh; or, in other words, the hornbill elements in the Long Glat design, though they are serially repeated, are quite separate and distinct one frorim the other, whilst in the Kayan desions the hornbill elemients are fused and modified to produce the sinuous line pattern that in one form or another is generally employed for the decoration of the back of the thigh. In this connection Plate IX, Fig. 5, is instructive; it is taken from a tatu-block which, together with those from which Figs. 1 and 2 are taken, was collected many years ago by Mr. Brooke Low, amongst the Kayans of the Upper Rejang; it also appears to be a hornbill derivative, and no doubt was used for the tatu of the front of a woman's thigh,' being serially repeated in thlree or four rows as with the Long Glat. Yet it was unknown as a tatu design to some Kayans of the Baram River to whom it was shown recently; they informed us that the name of the design was tuang buvong asu, pattern of dog without tail, and they stated that a somewhat similar design was engraved by them on sword blades. Plate I.X, Fig. 4, is taken from a tatu-block of uncertain origin, and the same name was also applied to this by the Baram Kayans. though with some hesitation and uncertainty; the hornbill motif is here quite obvious. Though apparently obsolete in Sarawak, the hornbill design is still to be found amongst the Uma Lekan2 of the Batang Kayan. Nieuwenhuis [9, Plate 96] figures a fine example of thigh tatu fromi these people, in which the front of the thigh is covered with four rows of a figure almost the samne as Fig. 5, and the back of the thigh is covered not with a line design, but with another modification of the hornbill design. Nieuwenhuis considers this to be ta dog motif, but, whilst we would not be positive about the figures on the back of the thigh, we feel sure that those on the front are modified hornbill motifs. We have here, perhaps, aln example of an animal motif being modified into another animal form, with a consequent change of name. Dr. Nieuwenhuis is very positive that the hornbill element is a characteristic 1 The wooden block is carefully cut square and the design occupies the whole of one surface; this is characteristic of the blocks of female designs, whereas designs for male tatu are carved on very roughly shaped blocks and do not always occupy the whole of one surface. Since the female designs have to be serially repeated it is important that the blocks should be of the exact required size, otherwise the projecting parts of the uncarved wood would retnder the exact juxtaposition of the serially repeated impressions very difficult, whilst the isolated male designs can be impressed on the skin in a more or less haphazard way. 2 Nieuwenhuis regards these people as Kenyahs; one of us, as a result of a long acquaintanlee with the tribe, is positive that they are Kayans. The method of the thigh tatu is quite diagnostic, no Kenyah tribes tatu in this manner on the thighs. Uma Lekan women like all other Kayans must have their tatu completed before marriage.</page><page sequence="14">C. HOSE AND R. SIIELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tlatu in Boaneo. 73 feature of Long Glat decorative art, and equally positive that the Kayains have borrowed somie of their desians fromn the Lono Glat'; it seems then likely that the Kayans whilst owing some of their tatu designs to the Long Glat, have not mnerely slavishly copied them, but have modified them; thus the Long Glat hornbill motif has been changed by the Kayans into a seinblance of the most imnportant motif in Kayan art, the dog, and with the change in form, has gone a change in name, so that to-day the Barami and Uimia Lekan Kayans term a design springing from a hornbill motif, buvony asu, or tailless dog. On Plate 97 of the above cited work is figutred another form of thigh tatu, the front of the tlhigh being covered with a scroll desian, the back of the thigh with a form of ida tuang, in which it is just possible to distinguish the hornbill heads, that lhave here become separated from the lines, lying in the spaces formed by the diverging of the lines; the modification is an interesting one, and we reproduce part of Nieuwenbuis' figure to illustrate it (Plate IX, Fig. 11). These two thigh patterns are peculiar in that on the outside they extend right up onl to the buttock; the different bands of the pattern are separated by rows of ikor, as is almost uniiversal in Kayan tatu; the knee-cap pattern is very remarkable and quite different from the Mendalam Kayan type. We have stated that an interlacing line design is generally employed for the back of the thligh ; we figure, however, a remarkable exception from the Baloi R-iver (Plate X, Fig. 5); this is known as kalong kowit, hook pattern; A is a representation of an antique bead, balalat lukut, B is known as kowit, hooks. Between the two strips of line design at the back of the thigh runs a narrow line of untatued skin, the supposed object of which has been described above. The front and sides of the thiglh in high-class woinen will be covered with three or imore strips of patterln such as are shown on Plate VIII, Figs. 4 and 5; in the latter tushutn tuva, dulany hcarok, Itlu tinggang and beliling bulan can again be recognised; the ulu tinggany in this examiple are less conventionalised than in the spirals of time forearm patterln, and a spiral form of tushun tuva is shownl in addition to the angular form. The other example exhibits ida lima, tushun tuva jalautt, kowit (the initerlocking spirals) and nilu tinggany. All these strips of pattern are separated by the ikor. The knee-cap is the last part of the leg to be, tatued and the design covering it is called the kalong nang, the inmportanlt pattern, a good example of which is shown in text, Fig. 4; Fig. 6 represelnts the design on the front and sides of the thigh of an Uma Semnuka Kayan of the slave class, whiclh also is termed tushna tuva. The admirable Uma Lekan patternis (Plate X, Fig. 2) represenit on the back of the thigh (AA) beliling bulan, on the front and sides (BB) silong, faces or silong lejant, tigers' faces; the latter is evidently an anthropomorph; the knee-cap design is I He states (9, p. 462) that the Kayan women borrow tatu-blocks (klinge' tedak) from the Long Glat, although the meni of their own tribe can carve admirably; and again (p. 460), a chiefs daughter wishing to have her legs tatued with a hornbill design, induced her father to fetch a tatu-block fromn the Long Glat.</page><page sequence="15">74 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORDx.-Aaterials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. particularly worthy of notice.' Nieuwenhuis [9, Plate 83, and 8, Plate XXVII] figures the thigh tatu of a Mendalam woman of the panjin or free-woman class; the back of the thigh is occupied by two strips of the four-line pattern, here termed ketong pat, and a somewlhat crude anthropomorphic design, known as kohong kelunan, human head, covers the front and sides of the thigh (text, Fig. 3); the cenltre of the knee-cap is occupied by a very similar anthropomorph, known however as FIG. 3. FIG. 4. FIG. 6. FIG. 5. nang klinge, the important design, and extending in a semicircle round the upper part of it is a design made up of intersecting zigzags and kiiown as kalong nyipa, I The drawing is taken from a rubbing of a, model carved by an Uma Lekan; this will account for the asymmetry noticeable every here and there throughout the design. A printfrom an actual tatu-block is shown in Plate IX, Fig. 7 ; this would be repeated serially in rows down the front, and sides of the thigh, so that absolute uniformity would be attained; the carver of the model, whiclh was about one-sixth life size, has not been able to keep the elements of his design quite uniform.</page><page sequence="16">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. 75 the snake design; below the knee-cap is a transverse banld of hour-glass shaped figures termed pedjalco. Nieuwenhuis also figures [9, Plate 84] the thigh pattern of a chief's daughter from the same river; this only difFers from the preceding example in the greater elaboration of the kohong kelunan; the back of the thigh is covered by a form of the ida pat pattern njot by the ida lima pattern. Some of the tatu-blocks employed by the Mendalam Kayan women are figured in the same works [9, Plate 82, and 8, Plate XXVIII]. A comparison of the text figures here given lends strong support to the supposition that the tuba-root pattern is merely a degraded anthropomorph. Fig. 3 is a recognisable anthropomorph such as is tatued in rows on the thigh, and sorme such name as tegulun, sihong or kohong is applied to it. Fig. 4 is a knee-cap design, evidently anthropomorphic in nature, but termed nang klinge, the important design, since it is the last part of all to be tatued. Fig. 5 is termied tutshun tuva, but a distinct face is visible in the centre of the pattern; the general sinlilarity between this last design and the examples of tushun tuva shown in the designs on Plate VIII, Figs. 4 and 5, is quite obvious; thelower of the two tushun tuva designs in Fig. 5, Plate VIII, is comiposed of angular lines, thus reverting to the angularity of the lines in text, Fig. 3; at E, Fig. 3, Plate X, the lines are partly angular, partly curved and the bilateral symmetry is entirely lost; finally in text, Fig. 6, the relationship of the tutshutnt tuva design to an anthropoinorph is entirely lost. A typical form of tatu on the foot of a low-class womnan is shown on Plate VIII, Fig. 6; a chief's daughter would have some modification of the principal element of the thigh design tatued on this part. The pattern shown on the thigh of a Kayan woman in the frontispiece of Dr. Furness's work [3] is unknown to us; the picture is suspiciously like a reproduction of a " touched-up " photo. ii. Kenyah tatu. The majority of the Sarawak Kenyahs are closely allied to the Kayans and their tatu inay be considered separately from that of the Kenyah-Kalamantan tribes whose tatu is mucli more original in design. The men of such Kenyah tribes as the Leppu Jengan, Leppu Tau, Leppu Apong, etc., are tatued in the Kayan manner, that is, with some form of dog design on the forearms and thighs and with rosettes or stars on the shoulders and breasts. The dog design is usually known as usang urang, the prawn pattern; the teeth of the dog are held to represent the notched border of the prominent rostrum characteristic of the prawns of the genus Paltemon, that occur so plentifully in the fresh-water streams of Borneo. An extreme modificationi of the dog design to form a prawn is shown in Plate VII, Fig. 9; Plate VI, Fig. 4, is a dog design atnd is so terined. Plate VI, Fig. 10, is knowni as toyn, a crab,; A is the mouith, ba; B the claw, katip; C the back, lilkut; D the tail, ikong. Plate AI, Fig. 9, is termed iipan katip, claws of the centipede (?). Text, Fig. 7, is kowit, hook pattern. All these are tatued on the flexor surface of the</page><page sequence="17">76 C. HOSE AND R.

The women of these tribes FIG. 7. tatu in the same way and employ the same designs as the Kayans except that they never tatu on the thighs (cf. Furness [3 p. 150 Plate]). Amongst the Baram Kenyahs there appears to be no ceremonial connected with the process of tatuing. iii. Kenyah Kalamantan tatu. Amongst this rather heterogeneous assemblage of tribes considerable diversity of tatu design is found. As a general rule the men are scarcely ever tatued, but when they are it is in the Kayan manner. The Peng or Pnihing onice had an elaborate system of male tatu, but it is almost obsolete now, and the only example that we have met is shown on I'late XI, Fig. 2. This represents the arm of a Peng man, a drawing of which was made by Dr. H. Hiller, of Philadelphia; unfortunately we have no information as to the significance of the design. The only other Peng design that we are acquainted with is a large disc tatued on the calf of the leg. Dr. Nieuwenhuis states that Peng women are tatued with isolated dog designs on the arms and legs like the men of Kayan tribes [9, p. 461]. The women of the Leppu Lutong, a nearly extinct tribe of the Pata River, Baram district, exhibit a very primitive style of tatu on the arms and hands Plate XJ, Fig. 4); a broad band encircles the middle of the forearm and a narrow band an inch or so distant of this also surrounds the arm; from this narrow band there run over the metacarpals to the base of the fingers eight narrow lines, the outermost on the radial side bifurcating; the design is known as betik WU or line pattern. No other part of the body is tatued. Nieuwenhuis figures [9, Plate 95] a somewhat similar design employed by the Uma Tow women of the Batang Kayan; but in this case, instead of eight longitu- dinal lines stoppitng short at the knuckles, there are five broad bands running to the finger nails, itnterrupted at the knuckles by a 2 cm.-broad strip of untatued skin. Moreover with these people the front and sides of the thigh and the shin are tatued with primitive looking designs made up of series of short transverse lines, curved lines, and broad bands; the naimes- of the designs are not given; these designs are said to be characteristic of the slave-class, the higher-class women copyinlg the more elaborate designs of the Uma Lekan. Amongst the Batang Kayan Kenyabs tatuing can not be executed in the com- munal house, but only in a hut built for the purpose. The males of the family, to I For other examples of modified asu designs employed by Kenyah tribes, see E. B. Haddon (4, pp. 117, 118).</page><page sequence="18">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Mlaterials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. 77 which the girl undergoing the operation belongs, must dress in bark-cloth and are confined to the house until the. tatu is completed; should any of the male members be travelling in other parts of the island, tatui cannot be commenced until they return. Amongst the Uma Tow the daughter of a chief must be tatued before any of the other females of the house; should the chief's daughter (or daughters) die before slie has been tatued all the other women of the house are debarred from this embellishment. (Nieuwenhuis [9, pp. 453, 454].) Nieuwenhuis in his great work on Borneo, which we have cited so often, gives a good account of the tatu of the Long Glat. According to this authority, girls when only eight years old have the backs of the fingers tatued, at thie commence- ment of menstruation the tatu of the fingers is completed, and in the course of the following year the tatu is carried over the backs of the hand to the wrist; the feet are tatued synchronously with the hainds. At the age of eighteen to twenty the front of the thigh is tatued and later on in life the back of the thigh; unlike the Kayans it is not necessary that the tatu of the thighs should be finished before child-bearing. A Long Glat woman on each day that she is tatued must kill a black fowl as food for the aitist. They believe that after death the completely tatued women will be allowed to bathe in the mythical river Telang Julan and that consequently they will be able to pick up the pearls that are found in its bed; incompletely tatued women can only stand on the river-bank, whilst the untatued will not be allowed to approach its shores at all. This belief appears to be universal amongst the Kenyah Kalainantan of the Upper Mahakkam and Batang Kayan. On Plate 86 of Nieuwenlluis' book [9] is figured the thigh tatu of a Long Glat woman; the front of the thigh is occupied with two rows of the horuibill motif to which reference has already been made. The sides of the thigh are tatued with a beautiful design of circles and scrolls termed ke'rip kwe, flight feathers of the Argus pheasant, and on the back of the thigh is a scroll design borrowed from the decoration of a grave and known as kalong song sepit.1 The knee is left untatued. Some other examples of the k&amp;rip kwe design are given on Plate 90, and of the song sepit on Plate 91; some of the song sepit designs recall the kalong kowit designs of the Baloi Kayans. Instead of a hornbill motif, a dog's head motif is sometimes tatued on the thigh, an example of which is figured on Plate 87, Fig. a; it appears to be a composition of four heads and in appearance is not unlike Uma Lekan silong lejau, figured by us. In the Long Glat thigh-tatu the bands of pattern are not separated by lines of ikor, as with the Kayans. Round the ankles the Long Glat tatu sixteen lines, 3 mim. broad, known as tedalc aking; the foot is tatued much after the manner shown in our Fig. 6, Plate XIII. The supinator surface of the forearm and the backs of the hands are also tatued but the design does not extend so far up the arm as with the Kayans [9, Plate, 92]; the forearm design is made up of a hornbill motif, but that shown in Fig. a of the plate is termed betik kule, leopard pattern, and is supposed to be a representation of the spots on the leopard's skin; it is stated to be taken fromn a The names of the designs are given in Kayan.</page><page sequence="19">78 C. HosE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materialsfor a Study of Tatu in Borneo. Long Tepai tatu-block; the knuckles are tatued with a double row of wedges, the fing,er joints with quadrangles. The UIina Luhat seeni to have borrowed their tatu and designs very largely if not entirely from the Long Glat; with them the back of the thigh is tatued before the front, which is exceptional. Half of the knee is tatued. Their designs are modifications of the hornbill and dog's head designs of the Long Glat. Nienwenhuis figures several examples [9, Plate 87, Fig. b, Plate 88, Plate 89, Plate 93, Fig. a, Plate 94], which should be consulted as they are of the greatest interest. The Long Wai seem to tatu in much the same way as the Uma Luhat [2, Plate, p. 189 and 7, p. 91]. iv. Kalamantan tatu. A number of tribes have adopted mnore or less the tatu of the Kayans. Thus the men of the following Sarawak tribes, Sibops, Lirongs, Tanjongs, Long Kiputs, Barawans, and Kanowits are often, though not universally, tatued like Kayans. The shoulder patterii of the Barawans is distinctive, in that the rosette nearly always bears a scroll attached to it, a relic of the dog motif, from which the design is derived (Plate' VIII, Fig. 6.) E. B. Haddon [4, Fig. 17] figures another form of the dog motif, which is tatued on the thigh or forearm, and Ling Roth [7, p. 86] figures three rosette designs for the breast; we figure two modifications of the dog design on Plate VII, Figs. 7 and 8. Thie women of these tribes very rarely tatu; we have seen a Tanjong woman with a circle of star-shaped figtures round her wrist and one on the thumb. The Tring women of Dutch Borneo are tatucd on the hands and tllighs like Kayans; Carl Bock [2, Plate, p. 187] gives some poor figures of them. In our opinion all of these tribes owe their tatu entirely to foreign influences; for we have failed to find a single example of an original design; the practice is by no means universal, and great catholicity of taste is shown by those who do tatu. The mnen, moreover, do not tatu as a sign of bravery in battle or adventure, but merely from a desire to copy the more warlike Kayan. We shall now treat of those tribes that have a distinctive and original tatu, but it is well to bear in mind, that amongst many of these people also the Kayan designs are coming into vogue more and mnore, ousting the old designs. No tatu- blocks are employed for the indigenous patterns, all the work beinig done free-hand. (a) Uma Long.-The Uma Long women of the Batang Kayan exhibit the most primitive form of tatu known in Borneo. It differs from every other form in that the tatued surface of the skin is not covered uniformly with the ink, but the design, such as it is, is merely stippled into the skin, producing an appearance of close-set irregular dots. Two aspects of the forearm of an Uma Long woman are shown on Plate XII, Fig. 5. No other part of the body is tatued, and the practice is confined to the fenmale sex. (b) Dusun.-The men only tatu. The design is simple, consisting of a band, two inches broad, curving from each shoulder and meeting its fellow on the stomach</page><page sequence="20">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tatut in Borneo. 79 thence each band diverges to the hip and there ends; from the shoulder each band runs down the upper arm on its exterior aspect; the flexor surface of the forearm is decorated with short transverse stripes, and, according to one auithority, each stripe marks an enemy slain [7, p. 90]. This form of tatu is found chiefly amongst the Idaan group of Dusuns; according to Whitehead [11, p. 106] the Dusuns living on the slopes of Mount Kina Balu tatu no more than the parallel transverse stripes on the forearm, but in this case no reference is made to the significance of the stripes as a head-tally. The Dusun women apparently do inot tatu. (c) Jfurnt.-The Muruts of the Trusan River, North Sarawak, tatu very little; the men occasionally have a small scroll design just above the knee-cap and a simple circle on the breast; the women have fine lines tatued fronm the knuckles to the elbows [7, p. 93]. The Muruts of British North Borneo appear to be more generally tatued; the men are tatued like Dusuns, though, according to Hatton, they have three parallel stripes running from the shoulders to the wrists and no transverse lines on the forearm.1 Whitehead [11, p. 76] figutres a Murut woman of the Lawas river tatued on the arms from the biceps to the knuckles with numerous fine longitudinal linss; a band of zigzag design encircles the arm just above the commencement of the lonaitudinal lines. The design on a man of the same tribe is given on page 73 [11], it resembles "a three-legged dog with a crocodile's head, one leg being turned over the back as if the animal was going to scratch its ear." The part of the body on which the design was tatued is not specified and the sketch is rather inadequate, so that it is impossible to tell for certain whether the design was tatued in outline only or whether the outline was filled in uniformly; our impression is that the outline only was tatued on this individual and that it was employed either as an experiment or from idle amuse- ment. Zoomorphs are conspicuous by their absence from all forms of decorative art amongst the Lawas Muruts, and the particular zoomorph noted here gives every evidence of an unpractised hand. St. John states [7, p. 92] that the Muruts of the Adang River, a tributary of the Limbang, are tatued about the arms and legs, but he gives no details. (d) Kalabit.-This tribe dwelling in the watershed of the Limbang and Baram Rivers are closely akin to Muruts, but their tatu is very different. The men tatu but rarely, and then with stripes down the arms. The women, however, are decorated with most striking geometrical desians, shown on Plate X II, Figs. 1-4. On the forearm are tatued eight bold zigzag bands, one-eighth of an inch broad, which do not completely encircle the arm, but stop short of joining at points on the ulnar side of the middle line on the flexor surface. The series of lines is known as betik tistP, the hand pattern. In some cases two short transverse lines, called tipalang, cross-lines, spring from the most distal zigzag at the poirnt where it touchels the back of the wrist on the radial side; in other cases these lines are tatued across the I The same author states that "a sometime headman of Senendan had two square tattoo marks on his back. This was because he ran away in a fight, and showed Ihis back to the enemy." The reason here given for the tatu marks is beyond belief,</page><page sequence="21">80 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Aaterials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. middle of the back of the wrist and two lozenges are tatued on the metacarpals; these are known as teparat itu (Plate XII, Fig. 1). The legs are tatued on the back of the thigh, on the shin, and sometimes on the knee-cap. The designs caii best be explained by a reference to Plate XII, Figs. 2 to 4; the part of the design marked A is termed betik buah, fruit pattern; B, betik lawa, trunk pattern; and C, betik lultud, shin pattern. In Fig. 4, A and C are as before; D is betik karawin; E, ujat batu, hill-tops; F, betik kalang (Fig. 3). Kalabit women are tatued when they are sixteen years old, whether they are married or unmlarried, anld the operation does not extend over a number of years as with the Long Glat and Kayans, nor is any elaborate ceremonial connected with the process. (e) Long Utan.-An extinct tribe, once dwelling on the Tinjar River, an affluent of the Baram. We owe our knowledge of their tatu to an aged Kalamantan, who was well acquainted with the tribe before their disappearance; at our behest he carved on some wooden models of arms and leas the tatu designs of these people, but he was unable to supply any information of the names or significance of the designs. The. men of the tribe apparently did not tatu, so that the designs repro- duced oln Plate XI, Figs. 5, 6, are those of the women. The essential features of the designs are spirals and portions of intersecting circles; the intersecting circles are frequently to be met with in the decorative art of Kelnyahs, e.g., on the back of sword-halndles, round the top of posts, on carved bainboos, etc., and in these cases the design is supposed to be a representation of the open fruit of a species of mango, Mangifera sp. It is not improbable that the desig,n had the same significance amongst the Long Utan, for we have met with one or two representations of the same fruit amongst other Kalamantan tribes. (f) Biajamt.-The-Dutch author C. den Hamer [5, p. 451] includes under this heading the tribes living in the districts watered by the rivers Murung, Kahayan, Katingan and Mentaja of South-west Borneo. Under this very elastic heading he would incllude the Ot Danum, Siang, and Ulii Ajar of Nieuwenhuis, but we treat of these in the next section. The ethnology of the Barito, Kahayan and Katingan river-basins sadly needs further investigation; notlhing of importance has been published on this region since the appearance of Schwaner's book on Borneo more than fifty years aao. We know really very little of the distribution or coinstitution of the tribes dwelling in these districts and Schwaner's account of their tatu is very meagre. Such as it is, it is given here, extracted from Ling Roth's Translation of Schwaner's Ethnographical Notes [7, pp. cxci. cxciv.]. The men of Puilu Petak, the right-hand lower branch of the Barito or Banjermassin River, tatu the upper part of the body, the arms and calves of legs with elegant interlacing designs and scrolls. The people of the Muruna River are said to be most beautifully tatued, both men and women; this river is really the upper part of the Barito, and according to Hamer is inhabited by the Biajau (vide postea), who appear to be distinct from the Ngaju of Schwaner, inhabitiiig the lower courses of the Barito alid Kapuas Rivers. The men of the lower left-hand branch of the</page><page sequence="22">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. 81 Barito and of the mid-course of that river are often not tatued at all, but such tatu as was extant in 1850 was highly significant according to Schwaner's account; thus, a figure composed of two spiral lines interlacing each other and with stars at the extremities tatued on the shoulder signified that the man had taken several heads; two lines meeting each other at an acute angle behind the finger nails signified dexterity in wood-carving; a star on the temple was a sign of happiness in love. We have no reason to consider this information inaccurate, but we do consider it lamentable that more details concerning the most interesting forms of tatu in Borneo were not obtained, for it is only too probable that such information cannot be acquired now, The women of this tribe do not tatu. In the upper Teweh River, an upper tributary of the Barito, the men are tatued a good deal, especially on parts of the face, such as the forehead, the clheeks, the upper lip. The only figures that Schwaner gives are reproduced by Ling Roth [7, p. 93], they represent two Ngajus; the tatu designs are drawn on too small a scale to be of much interest; and in any case we have no information concerning them. The two figures of 'Tatued Dyaks ' (? Kyans) (after Professor Veth)," oil p. 95 of the above- cited work cannot be referred to any tribe known to us. Hamer in his paper [5] gives a detailed account of Biajau tatu, but unfortunately without any illustrations; as abstracts of the paper have already been given by Ling Roth [7, pp. 93, 94] and by Hein [6, pp. 143-147], we will pass on to the next section. (g) Ot-Danutm, Ulu Ajar and Siang (Kapuas River tributaries).-Colicerning these tribes Nieuwenhuis says but little [9, p. 452], merely noting that the men are first tatued with discs on the calf and in the hollow of the knee and later over the arms, torso and throat, whilst the women tatu the hands, knees and shins. Two colours, red and blue, are used, and the designs are tatued free-halnd, the instrument employed being a piece of copper or brass about four inches long and half-an-inch broad, with one end bent dowln at a right-angle and sharpened to a point; sometimes thread is wound round the end of the instrument just above the point, to regulate the depth of its penetration; two specimens in the Leyden Museum are figured by Ling Roth [7, p. 85]. Hamer [5] says that the Ot-Danum women are tatued down the shin to the tarsus with two parallel lines, joined by niumerous cross-lines, a modification of the Uma Tow design for the same part of the limb. On the thigh is tatued a design termed soetvroe, said to resemble a neck ornament. A disc tatued on the calf of the leg is termed boentoer, and from it to the heel runs a barbed line called ikoeh bajan, tail of the monitor lizard' curiously enough, though this is the general name of the design, it is on the right leg also termed bararek, on the left dandoe tjatjah. Warriors are tatued on the elbow-joint with a dandoe tjatjah and a cross called sara pang mattca andau. A Maloh who bad lived for many years amongst these people gave us the following information about their tatu. There is with these people a great difference between the tatu of the high class and that of the low class individuals: VOL. XXXVI. G</page><page sequence="23">82 C. HosE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. amoingst the former the desiglns are both extensive and complicated, too complicated for our informant to describe with any degree of accuracy, but they seem to be much the same as those described by Hamer. The low-class people have to be content with simpler designs; the men are tatued on the breast and stomach with two curved lines ending in curls, and on the outside of each arm with two lines also ending in curls (Plate XII, Fig. 6); on the outside of the thigh a rather remarkable design, shown on Plate XlI, Fig. 7, is tatued; it is termed linsat, the flying squirrel, Pteromys nitidus, and on the back of the calf is tatued a disc termed kalong baboi, the pig pattern. The women are tatued as described by Hamer down the front of the shin with two parallel lines connected by transverse cross-bars; according to our informant the design was supposed to represent a flat fish, such as a sole. (Plate XII, Fig. 8.) Of these people, as of so many others, the melancholy tale of disappear- ance of tatu amongst the present generation and replacement of indigenous by Kayan designs was told, and it seems only too likely that within the next decade or two none will be left to illustrate a once flourishing and beautiful art. Schwaner can add nothing to the facts that we have collected, except the statement that " the bilians (priestesses) have brought the art of tatuing to the present degree of perfection through learning the description of the pretty tatued bodies of the [mythical] Sangsangs." (h) Kahayan.-Our figure (Plate XI, Fig. 3), and Plate 81 of Dr. Nieuwenhuis' book [9], is the extent of our knowledge of the tatu of the inhabitants of the Kahayan River. The latter illustration shows a man tatued with a characteristic check pattern over the torso, stomach and arms, but there is lno reference to the plate in the text. Our figure is copied from a drawing by Dr. H. Hiller, of Philadelphia. (i) Bakatan and Ukit.-As Nieuwenhuis has pointed out [9, p. 451], the tatu of these tribes is distinctive, inasmuch as most of the designs are left in the natural colour of the skin against a background of tatu ; that is to say in the phraseology of the photographer, whilst the tatu designs of Kayans, Kenyahs, etc., are positives, those of the Bakatans are negatives. The men were formerly most extensively tatued, and we figure the principal designs (Plate XIII), most of which were drawn from a Bakatan of the Rejang River. The chest is covered with a bold scroll design known as g9rowit, hooks (Kayan, kowit) (Figs. 1, 2); across the back and shoulder blades stretches a double row of circles, kanak, with small hooks interposed (Fig. 9); on the side of the shoulder a pattern known as akih, the lizard, Ptychozoon homalocephaluni (Fam. Geckonidae), is tatued (Figs. 3, 4); this lizard is used as a haruspex by the Bakatan. Circles are tatued on the biceps, on the back of the thigh and on the calf of the leg; a inodification of the scroll design of the chest occurs on the flexor surface of the forearm. Another form of pattern for the calf of the leg is shown in text Fig. 9, it is termed selong bowang, the horse-mango, Miangifera sp., the same fruit as that termed by Kayans ipa olimn and</page><page sequence="24">C. HosE AND R. SHELFORD.-Mfaterials for a Study of T1atu6 in Borneo. 83 of which a representation forms the chief element in the Long Utan tatu. A series of short lines is tatued on the jaw and is termed ja, lines, or kilang, sword-pattern, and a gerowit design occurs under the jaw; the pattern on the throat is known also as gerowit (Fig. 10). On the forehead is sometimes tatued a star or rosette pattern called lukut, antique bead, and it appears that this is of the nature of a recognition mark. In jungle warfare, where a stealthy descent on an unprepared enemy constitutes the main principle of tactics, it not unfrequently happens that one body of the attacking force unwittingly stalks another, and the results might be disastrous if there was not some means of distinguishing, friend from foe when at close quarters.' Kenyahs when on the warpath frequently tie a FIG. 8. BIG. 9. band of plaited palm fibre round the wrist for the same object. The tatu of the backs of the hands is avowedly copied from the Kayans, but has a different name applied to it-kukumn. The metatarsus is tatued with broad bars, iwa, very like the foot tatu of Kayan women of the slave or of the middle class; lines known as jango encircle the ankle. Tatuing is forbidden in the house; it can only be performed on the warpath, and consequently men only are the tatu artists. The covering of the body with I As an instance of a quite opposite effect produced by a mark on the forehead, we may note here, that some Madang, who had crossed over from the Baram to the Rejang on a visit, appeared each with a cross marked in charcoal on his forehead; they supposed that by this means they were disguised beyond all recognition by evil spirits. The belief that such a trivial alteration of appearance is sufficient disguise is probably held by most tribes; Tama Bulan, a Kenyah chief when on a visit to Kuching, discarded the leopard's teeth, which when at home he wore through the upper part of his ears, and the reason that he alleged was the same as that given by the Madang. These people believe not only that evil spirits may do theni harm whilst they are on their travels, but also that, being encountered far from their homes, the spirits will take advantage of their absence to work some harm to their wives children, or property. G 2</page><page sequence="25">84 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study oj Tatu in Borneo. designs is a gradual process, and it is only the most seasoned and experienced warriors who exhibit on their persons all the different designs that we have just detailed; the tatu of the legs and feet is the last to be completed, and the lines round the ankles are denied to all but the bravest veterans. All that has been written above applies equally well to the Ukits, or at least once, did apply, for now the Ukits have to a great extent adopted the tatu of the Kayan, and it, is only occasionally that an old man tatued in the original Ukit manner is met. We give a figure of a design on the back of the thigh of such a relic of better days. (Plate XIII, Fig. 5.) The Bakatan and Ukit women tatu very little, only the forearm, on the metacarpals and on the back of the wrist; characteristic designs for these parts are shown in text Fig. 8, and Plate XIII, Figs. 7, 8 ; the central part of the forearm design is an anthropomorphic derivative, judgin-g by the name tegulun; the lines are termed kilang, and kanak and gerowit are also conspicuous; gerowit is also the name of the design for the metacarpals; the two stars joined by a line on the wrist are termed lekut, and it is possible that their significance is the same as that of the Kayan lukut tatued in the saine place by men, but we have no evidence that this is the case. Nieuwenhuis figures [9, Plate 80] a Bakatan tatued on the chest in the typical manner. The only other designs, apparently of Kalamantan origin, are those figured by Ling Roth [7, p. 87]. Three of these are after drawings by Rev. W. Crossland, and are labelled " tatu marks oIn arm of Kapuas Kayan captive woman." The designs are certainly not of Kayan origin, nor are there any Kayans resident in the Kapuas River; the woman had in all probability been brought captive to Sarawak, where Mr. Crossland saw her, either by Kayans or Sea Dayaks, and it is certainly unfortunate that exact information concerning the tribe to which she belonged was not obtained; the designs, if accurately copied, are so extremely unlike all that are known to us that we are not able to hazard even a guess at their provenance or meaning. The other design figured on the same page is copied from Carl Bock; it occurred on the shoulder of a Punan and is said by Mr. Crossland to be commonly used by the Sea Dayaks of the Undup. We met with a similar example of it (Plate VIII, Fig. 7) on an Ukit tatued in the Kayan manner, but could get no information concerninig it, and suppose that it is not an Ukit design. Hein [6, Fig. 90] figures the same design, and Nieuwenhuis [8, p. 240] alludes to a similar. We may note here that the designs figured on page 89 of Ling Roth's book [7] as tatu designs are in our opinion most certainly not tatu designs. They were collected by Dr. Wienecke in Dutch Borneo, and appear to be nothing but drawings by a native artist of such objects in daily use as hats, seat-mats, baby-slings, and so on. We communicated with Dr. J. D. E. Schmeltz of the Leyden Museun, where these " tatu" marks are deposited, and learnt from him that they are indeed actual drawings on paper; there are ninety-two of them, apparently all are different isolated designs, and they are evidently the work of one artist. There is</page><page sequence="26">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tatu 'in Borneo. 85 not a tribe in Borneo which cani show such a variety of tatu design, and indeed we doubt if ninety-two distinct isolated tatu designs could be found throughout all the length and breadth of the island. Moreover, as can be seeii by reference to the cited work, the designs are of a most complicated nature, not figures with the out- lines merely filled in, as in all tatu designs known to us, but with the details drawn in fine lines and cross-hatching, which in tatu would be utterly lost unless executed on a very large scale.' v. Sea Dayak tatu. The Sea Dayaks at the present day are, as far as the men are concerned, the most extensively tatued tribe in Borneo, with the exception of the Bakatans, Ukits, Kahayans and Biajau; nevertheless, from a long-continued and close study of their tatu, we are forced to the conclusion that the practice and the designs have been entirely borrowed from other tribes, but chiefly from the Kayans. For some time we believed that there were two characteristically Sea Dayak designs, namely, that which is tatued on the throat (text, Figs. 11-13) and that on the wrist (Plate XIII, Fig. 7), but when later we studied Bakatan tatui we met with the former in the gerowit pattern on the throat of men and the latter in the lukut design on the wrist of the women. A Sea Dayak youth will simply plaster himself, so to speak, with -numerous isolated designs; we have counted as many as five of the asu design on one thigh alone; the same design appears two or three times on the armis, and even on the breast, though this part of the body as well as the shoulders is more usually decorated with several stars and rosettes. The backs of the hands are tatued, quite irrespective of bravery or experience in warfare, in fact we have frequently had occasion to note that a m-an with tatued hands is a wastrel or a conceited braggart, of no accouint with Europeans or with his own people. This wild and irresponsible system of tatu has been accomiipanied by an inevitable degradation of the designs. There is a considerable body of evidence to show that the Sea Dayaks have borrowed much in their arts and crafts from tribes more early established in Borneo, but it must be confessed that in their decorative art they have as a rule improved upon their models; their bamboo carvings and their woven cloth are indeed "things of beauty," and if there is not much true originality in their work, it can still be said that they are the most artistic people in Borneo. An exception, however, must be made in the case of their tatu, for here we see, not an intelligent elaboration of the model, but a simplification and degradation or at best an elaboration without significance. Figs. 1-6, Plate VII, are examples of the Sea Dayaks tuang asu or dog design. With the exception of text, Fig. 10, which is a good copy of a Kayan model, the figures show the dog design run mad, and it is idle to attempt to interpret I Dr. Schmeltz has kindly furnished us with an advance sheet of his forthcoming catalogue of the Borneo collection in the Leyden Museum; he catalogues these drawings as tatu marks, but in a footnote records our opinion of them made by letter. Dr. Nieuwenhuis apparently adheres to the belief that they really are tatu marks.</page><page sequence="27">86 C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materialsfor a Study of TatuG in Borneo. them, since in every case the artists have given their individual fancies free play. When the profession of the tatu-artist is hereditary and when the practice has for its object the embellishment of definite parts of the body for definite reasons, we naturally find a constancy of design, or, if there are varieties, there is a purpose in FIG. 10. them, in the sense that the variations caln be traced to pre-existing formis and do not depart from the original so widely that their significance is altogether lost. With the borrowing of exogenous designs arises such an alteration in their form, that the original namnes and significance are lost; the Kayan modification of the hornbill design of the Long Glat to a dog design is a case in poinlt. But when the very practice of tatu has no special meaning, when the tatu artist may be any menmber of the tribe, and where no original tatu design is to be found in the tribe, then the borrowed practice and the borrowed designs, unbound by any sort of tradition, run complete riot and any sort of fanciful name is applied to the degraded designs. Amongst the Kenyah tribes the modification and degradation of the dog design has not proceeded so far as amongst the Sea Dayaks, and this may be explained for by their more restrained practice of tatu and by the constant intercourse between them and the Kayans, so that they always have good ilmodels before them. Plate VI, Fig. 3, illustrates the extreme limit of degradation of the dog design amongst Sea Dayaks; it is termed kala, scorpion,' and it is noteworthy that the representation of the chelhe and anterior end of the scorpion (A) was originally the posterior end of the dog, and the hooked ends of the posterior processes of this scorpion design (B) instead of facing one another as they did when they represented the open jaws of the dog now look the same way; the rosette-like eye of the dog still persists, but of course it has no significance in the scorpion. A curious modification of this eye is seen in another Sea Dayak scorpion design figured by E. B. Haddon [4, Fig. 19]. Furness [3, p. 142] figures a couple of scorpion designs, but neither are quite as debased as that which we figure here. Furness also figures a scroll design, not unlike a Bakatan Mr. E. B. Haddon (4, p. 124) writes: "The tattoo design used by the Kayans and Kenyahs . . . has been copied and adopted by the Ibans in the same way as the Kalamantans have done, the nmain difference being, that the Ibans call the design a scorpion. For this reason the pattern tends to become more and more like the scorpion . . ." The italics are ours. Is not this "putting the cart before the horse?" It is only when the design resembles a scorpion that the term scorpion is applied to it; all other modifications, even though tending towards the scorpion, are called dog.</page><page sequence="28">C. HOSE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materitls for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. 87 design, tatued on the forearm, and termed tatia gasieng, the thread of the spinning wheel; a similar one figured by Ling Roth [7, p. 88] is termed trong, the egg plant. On the breast aind shoulders some form of rosette or star design is tatued in considerable profusion; the designs are known variously as bunga trong, the egg plant flower, tandan buah, bunches of fruit, lukut, anl antique bead, ringgit salilang. A four-pointed star, such as that shown in text, Fig. 1, is termed buah andu, fruit of Plukenetia cornicutlata; since this fruit is quadrate in shape with pointed angles it is evident that the naine has been applied to the pattern because of its resemblance to the fruit. Furness figures exainples of these designs and also Ling Roth [7, p. 88]. We figure (text, Figs. 11-13) three designs for the throat known sometimes as katak, frogs, sometimes as tali gasieng, thread- of the spinning wheel, and no doubt other meaningless names are applied to them. Two of the figures (Figs. 11, 12) are evidently modifications of the Bakatan gerowit FIGS. 11, 12, 13. design, but here they are represented with the tatu pigment, whilst with the Bakatans the design is in the natural colour of the skin against a background of pigment, i.e., the Dayak design is the positive of the Bakatan negative. Furness figures two examples of the throat design, one with a transverse row of stars cutting across it; the same authority also figures a design for the ribs known as tali sabit, waist chains, consisting of two stars joined by a double zig,zag line. The same design is sometimes tatuied on the wrist when it is known as lukutt, antique bead; it is also tatued on the throat [7, p. 88] and attention has already been drawn to the probable, derivations of this design also from a Bakatan model. It is only very seldom that Sea Dayak womren tatu and then only in small circles on the breasts [7, p. 83] and on the calves of the legs. As a conclusion to the foregoing accouint of Bornean tatu we add a table which summarises in the briefest possible manner all our information; its chief use</page><page sequence="29">88 C. HosE AND R. SHELFORD.-Materials for a Study of Tatu in Borneo. perhaps will lie in showing in a graphic manner the blanks in our knowledge that still remain. From a study of their tatu Dr. Nieuwenhuis [9, p. 451] divides the people of Borneo into three main groups: 1. Group of Bahau, Kenya and Punan. 2. Groups of Bukat and Bakatan. 3. Group of Barito and Melawi tribes, and Ulu Ajar of the Mandai River. From what we have written it will be understood on what principles this classification is based and, as far as it goes, it is correct enough, except for the inclusion of the Punan in the first group, but it is not sufficiently comprehensive in the light of the further information that we have unearthed. We do not consider that tatu can ever be of much value in clearing up racial problems, seeing how much evidence there is of interchange of designs and rejection of indigenous designs in favour of something newer; consequently we refrain from drawing up another scheme of classification of tatu in Borneo; at best it would be little more than a re-eniumeration of the forms that we have already described in more or less detail.
