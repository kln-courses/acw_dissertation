<plain_text><page sequence="1">Community, Assimilation, and the Unfamiliar Tim Donovan Fellowship We are five friends, one day we came out of the house one after the other, first one came and placed himself beside the gate, then the second came, or rather he glided through the gate like a little ball of quicksilver, and placed himself near the first one, and then came the third, then the fourth, then the fifth. Finally we all stood in a row. People began to notice us, they pointed at us and said: "Those five just came out of that house." Since then we have been living together; it would be a peaceful life if it weren't for the sixth one continually trying to interfere. He doesn't do us any harm, but he annoys us, and that is harm enough; why does he intrude where he is not wanted? We don't know him and don't want him to join us. There was a time, of course, when the five of us did not know one another, either; and it could be said that we still don't know one another, but what is possible and can be toler- ated by the five of us is not possible and cannot be tolerated with the sixth one. In any case, we are five and don't want to be six. And what is the point of this continual being together anyhow? It is also pointless for the five of us, but here we are together; a new combination, however, we do not want, just because of our experiences. But how is one to make this clear to the sixth one? Long explanations would almost amount to accepting him in our circle, so we prefer not to explain and not to accept him. No matter how he pouts his lips, we push him away with our elbows, but however much we push him away, back he comes. - Franz Kafka 1. I want to introduce this essay on Edmund Spenser's early modern dialogue View of the Present State of Ireland with a contemporary question influ- enced by Franz Kafka's epigraph: What are the principles that presuppose an understanding of community? I have purposely stated the question of belonging as "an understanding" rather than "what are the principles that we presuppose as " After all, who is this we that so easily gathers iden- tity within the common usage?

Yet as Kafka's allegory implies: What presupposes the propriety of those familiar experiences we name our own? Spenser's dialogue is undoubtedly challenging, a challenge that has drawn an enormous amount of recent critical analysis from literary critics and historians. Still, a general difficulty persists. Michael Donnelly sum- marizes the difficulty quite well when he notes that the View is quite "anoma- lous in the Spenserian oeuvre," a rather strange dialogue that seems uncharacteristic of the poet's humanist image (1). The challenges certainly begin with the troubling difficulties of an argument that concludes with the stark political necessities of enforced famine, massive relocation, and eth- nic cleansing. Furthermore, the anxious burden of justifying this dire pro- gram expresses itself in a tone that would be thought intemperate even by many of Spenser's contemporaries (McCabe, 116). More important than the dialogue's dire tone of determination, there is a continued resonance of enforced cultural assimilation and genocide that haunts our contemporary world forewarned by arguments of pathology and apartheid. However, a glance at recent political news would indicate that these forewarnings are repeatedly ignored. I believe the challenge that the View evokes dwells in the traditional lineage of the concept of community. Thus, we cannot so easily dismiss Spenser's dialogue as merely an early modern problem; nor can we dismiss it as another diatribe in the long-standing tradition of racial screeds. The political problems that the dialogue engages foreshadow cur- rent conflicts, specifically the politics of ethnic integrity, a program so of- ten referred to by the euphemism "ethnic cleansing." Spenser's dialogue exemplifies the anxious intolerance that results from a foreign encounter between the familiar and the unfamiliar. In the View, Ireland resembles Kafka's "sixth fellow," not because the Irish de- mand inclusion within the commonwealth; quite the contrary, their intrac- table resistance demands independence. Rather, Ireland represents what Michel Foucault theorizes as a "heterotopia," a boundary space that exists in juxtaposition to the normative commonality of an established political community (1987, 24). The heterotopia actualizes a "counter-site," an ex- treme "elsewhere" that establishes by contrast the primacy of normative recognition. Ireland is an extreme that persists as an unnatural place of evil and disorder, a place that resists the law of similitude and, thus, challenges the righteousness of sovereignty. Unlike the "togetherness]" in Kafka's allegory, which is based on exclusion that repels alterity to establish pro-</page><page sequence="3">246 TIM DONOVAN priety, Spenser's dialogue presumes that identification and assimilation of alterity are necessary to confirm the national identity and integrity of the English commonwealth. The dialogue's apocalyptic tone is anxious only in its resolve to enforce a radical program of reform that would domesti- cate and civilize the brutish habits of the Irish. The assimilation necessary to reform the Irish body politic and unite an English commonwealth con- tinues the anxious recoil of Kafka's fellows, a threatening problem that is finally eased by reproducing normative identity through the ongoing pro- cess of cultural equivalence embodied in the law. Yet the "sixth fellow" continually seems to return. He haunts the familiar experiences of our com- munities. He interrupts the social consensus of our lawful agreements. He weakens our confidence in an ethics of universal goodness. He disappoints our well-intended pluralism. Again and again, "back he comes." I view the dialogue as an example within a comprehensive structure of violent assimilation inherent within conceptual identity of community, a view that is influenced by contemporary thinkers Jürgen Habermas, Alphonso Lingis, Jacques Derrida, and Jean-Luc Nancy as they encounter the conceptual limits that haunt being-in-common. I certainly risk irrespon- sibility toward the period's historical specificity by bringing a contempo- rary viewpoint to bear on the dialogue's dire conclusions, one that perhaps patronizes the political conflicts of the early modern period with twenty- twenty contemporary insight. But it is really not hyperbolic to claim that the work of Nancy, Derrida, and Habermas gathers its motivation and di- rection from the catastrophic outcome of World War II, a conflict that in- troduced the possibility of global destruction, but also another unprecedented outburst that witnessed the most systematic effort to purge differing ethnic and cultural communities from existence. Some lingering remains of nostalgia for enlightened progress might persuade us to blame these disasters on a corrupted reason or fascistic absolutism that has long since destroyed itself. But ongoing efforts of ethnic cleansing and apart- heid persist despite these disasters. I focus on Spenser's text not simply to analyze patterns of discrimination toward the Irish. Moreover, the dialogue exemplifies the fundamental absolute of unity that is inherent within the concept of community, an absolute that demands inclusion but is haunted by the necessity of exclusion. Within the boundaries of community, I draw on the View as a precau- tion for rhetoricians so faithful to the possibilities of rational dialogue. My assertion should not be understood as a relentlessly negative point; rather, the issue is directed against the faith in the possibility of pragmatic social consensus. Alphonso Lingis succinctly directs my claim when he asks, "How</page><page sequence="4">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 247 do we engage those who offer us nothing in common?" (10). For many rhetoricians and theorists, Habermas has negotiated the impasse that Lingis presents by providing a universal pragmatics attentive to the other. How- ever, I believe that his theory intensifies the very problems that he expects to overcome. In short, his enlightenment project of restoring a rational com- munity is actually complicit in the violence it intends to overcome. 2. The view of Ireland that Spenser proposes must be framed in the larger historico-political movement of colonization, which is activated by two ideas that constantly interacted throughout the Renaissance: the ethos of modernism as well as the revolutionary reformist spirit of the Reforma- tion. The ethos of reformation is implied in Spenser's call for a rehabilita- tion that is a complete "new-framing" of Ireland. Such a revolutionary vision finds its fervor in the renewal called for by the Protestant Reformation. Luther's dismissal of Rome's magisterial authority introduced the primacy of the individual conscience. Without the ecclesiastical mediation of the papacy, the purified church was reformed on the authority of God's justifi- cation in faith alone. The radical force of the Protestant reform was not merely satisfied that abuses in the church must be corrected, but more radi- cally charged that the Roman Church itself, even if perfected by its own ideals, was wrong in principle. In sum, the Reformation aimed not to re- store the medieval church but to overthrow its dominion. And in its place a new church was founded on the priesthood of all believers. The Reforma- tion made the necessity of purification an individual issue of personal con- science and one of temporal historical responsibility. Therefore, within the concomitant issue of purification and reform, the Reformation redirects the eschatological structure of religion as an end directed toward the secu- lar matter of historical rehabilitation. Foucault's remarks about the modern pastoral caution us against the absolutism that underlies any historical re- habilitation that longs for a sign of salvation in this world. As he evaluates it, "the search for a morality that is acceptable to everyone in the sense that everyone should submit to it, is a goal that seems ultimately catastrophic" (1984, 206). Thus within this milieu of reform, Foucault's example of the hetero- topic space is not necessarily an unmarked boundary, but it draws forth the possibility of colonization, conversion, and completion. As he notes about</page><page sequence="5">248 TIM DONOVAN the Puritan societies of North America, the trait of a heterotopia is to create another "real space, as perfect, as meticulous [and] well arranged that con- forms with the deformed and degenerateci 1987, 25). To return to Kafka's parable of community contextualized within the ethos of reform, the "sixth fellow" is a source of aggravating attraction, and not because of his persis- tent challenge to the contingency of their association. Rather, the other fellow becomes a candidate for membership completed through the con- version of civilization. Yet when this conversion is resisted by the "sixth," or, in Spenser's case, the brute, this anxiety traumatizes the ideological resolve of the community and the nation. The movement of Reformation is fundamentally toward purification that progressively cleanses, revealing God's saving destiny in the totality of his perfection. Merely a passing understanding of the Old Testament or more generally classical culture would indicate the importance of purifica- tion as a restorative, but also as a constituitive principle of a community. This eschatological history of restorative possibility motivates Spenser's heterotopic designs to complete the "opportunity to make a perfect reformed Common Wealth of that kingdom which was never like in the former state to be reformed" (Spenser, 133). Ultimately, the desire to relentlessly colo- nize heterotopic spaces is symptomatic of Nietzsche's typology of the "bad consciousness" in the Genealogy of Morals, a pathological condition that tries to qualify for immanence by being clean and cleaning the world around it of the evil, the dirty, and the annoying; in this way they establish them- selves as the one that desires purity, even if they themselves are impure. The view that Spenser proposes of Ireland must be framed in the larger historical-political issue of Counter-Reformation occurring in the late sixteenth century. By the middle of that century the Catholic Church, renewed by a deepening of its religious life, and by an uncompromising restatement of its dogmas and discipline, had devised also the political machinery for a counteroffensive against Protestantism. In the machinery of enforcing religious belief, beyond the Jesuits, no engine was to be so powerful as the apparatus of state or political sovereignty. Where Catho- lics retained control of governments, people became Catholic. Where Prot- estants retained control of governments, Catholics remained minorities. Thus, religion was a real source of political resistance, where faith knew no frontiers and overlapped all political boundaries. And it was the clash of governments, namely - in war and colonial adventures - that influenced the trends of European religion to work itself out. For England, the counterreformation was particularly threatening. As a bulwark of Protes-</page><page sequence="6">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 249 tantism, but an island of only four million people, it was surrounded by the hostile colonies of Scotland and Ireland and further imperiled by the threat of its perennial enemy, France. However, the most decisive threat to En- gland was Spain ruled by Phillip II, who was fervently committed to the Catholic reform of Europe. Schematically, within this rather volatile period of international po- litico-religious struggle of countering reformations, England's position as a rampart of English Protestantism became vulnerable to the crusading designs of Spain. Foremost, during this period of international intrigue, Ireland became more than a colonial nuisance; it became an important fo- cus for Tudor foreign policy (Palmer, 139). Not only was the Catholic pres- ence, and by consequence allegiance to Spain, a major concern for England, but Ireland's geographical position threatened English enclosure and at- tack. The rumors of Spanish intervention in Ireland loom heavily over the English for most of the sixteenth century, and these suspicions were cer- tainly well founded. As early as 1529, long before any direct Spanish inter- vention (intervention that began in 1578 with Fitzgerald landing in Smerwick with "600 men in the pay of the Pope" and in 1588 with Drake's defeats of the Armada), the Spanish saw the annexation of Ireland as a means of conquering England (Palmer, 108). As Juan Salces notes, the Irish frequently solicited Spanish aid in an attempt to vanquish the English: On 24 February 1529, the Spanish monarch, Charles V, wrote a letter from Toledo to his private chaplain, Don Gonzalo Fernandez, in which he asked him to set off to Ireland, to the estate of the Earl of Desmond, as quickly as possible. Charles V was giving an answer to a message from the Earl that had been brought to Spain a few weeks earlier by one of his principal nobles, an officer by the name of Galfididus. The mission of the king's private confessor was to inspect the military forces, which the Irish Earl had just put into the service of the Spanish Crown. This "present," which was received with the utmost joy (since, after all, Spain had begun to suffer from the effects of the Lutheran Reformation), was accompanied by a message that, in due course, would change Spanish military strategy during the troublesome years of the second half of the sixteenth century (186). Historians have questioned both the seriousness of Spain's annex- ation goals and its reputed support for the Catholic cause in Ireland. None- theless, the combined threat of native rebellion and foreign invasion led to immediate policy changes toward the colony by the Crown1 (Palmer, 53). The threatening anxiety represented by the combined religious and politi- cal maneuvers of the Counter-Reformation led England in 1539 to a mas-</page><page sequence="7">250 TIM DONOVAN sive intensification of troop deployment and coastal defense (53). The spe- cific concentration of military force in Ireland cannot be underestimated, for equally rebellious Scotland remained overlooked as a potential site of foreign influence. Historians mark this period of military development as a reconsideration of foreign policy toward Ireland, identifying it as a hostile place of "foreign intrigue" that had to be conquered for national security, rather than merely assimilated for humanist reform (Brady, 33). Within the View, Spenser obliquely dismisses the legitimacy of legendary assumptions regarding Spain as the origin of the Celts presented in the Irish Chronicles. The rhetorical effect delimits the historical warrant for legitimate Spanish annexation, which was the primary reason for repeated petitions from the Irish. The designs of Tudor foreign policy not only suggest an interna- tional defensiveness, but over the course of the century the specific atti- tude toward Irish social reform became increasingly severe. In general, in order to situate Spenser's recommendations in the View, I want to explain England's turning away from foreign policy of cultural assimilation to- ward one of aggressive conquest. Many historians generally agree that for the greater part of the period, the primary objectives of governmental re- form in Ireland were to domesticate the rebellious native families and elimi- nate the treachery of the Anglo-Irish Pale (Canny, Brady, Palmer). Reform entailed redefining and domesticating a largely tribal society to a more centralized form of government and private property. Therefore, transform- ing Irish society would entail adopting English forms of land tenure and inheritance along patrilineal lines, as opposed to the Irish custom of tanistry. Most important, the social restructuring would mean the end of "clientage," a deeply entrenched patronage network organized around the practices of coyne and livery (Brady, 17). Eliminating an enduring social practice that was ostensibly graft and extortion threatened the private interests of con- ventional wealth and authority esteemed by both the Old English Pale and the Gaelic Irish Lords. Throughout this period of concerted reform dating from 1640 to 1680, recurring matters of private interest - a euphemism for greed - often undermined the extent of governmental policy progress. De- spite periodic rebellions and local antagonisms throughout most of the cen- tury, the English remained confident in the institutional reconstruction of government, a measure that could remediate the Irish by making them "fit to the laws" (Spenser, 37). Such a confidence was warranted by the pre- sumed natural civility and virtue of English culture; thus, through a pro- cess of patient assimilation the efficacy of Common Law would make the</page><page sequence="8">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 25 1 "Irish answerable to English rule" (44). The essentially conservative re- form process was ordered by the basic assumption of extending the estab- lished governmental structures headed by the royal governors. Since the reformers were primarily English Pale lawyers and administrators, the most loyal to the English community, the English were confident in their advo- cacy and trusted that it was simply necessary to enlarge "Dublin's govern- ments control over the whole island through the employment of the same instruments and procedures which worked with such sufficiency in En- gland itself (Brady, 28). The ambitious challenge of governmental reform developed in 1540, however, met serious opposition and resulted in struggles that finally un- dermined the English policy of constructive reform and detente. In quite a short course on an extremely complex history of colonial trial, the Dublin administration became a source of criticism by many of the same Palesmen who had sought civil reform (32). Direct grievances to the Crown by crit- ics left the viceroy's representation questionable. Ciaran Brady sums up the dissolution: It was this imputation that the Dublin governors were reneging upon their principal obligation to respect the rights of subjects under the reformed Irish constitution that made the conflict between the Palesmen and the governors particularly rancorous and personal from the outset. To the governors, those who complained against them were simply malcontents, political intriguers and eventually "arrant papists"; to the complaints the governors were profit- seeking adventurers and freebooters, men who had taken the land of Ireland out of contract. (33) The basic intransigence of some Pale factions, concerned with nothing more than colonial acquisition, made reform difficult and political corruption inevitable (Palmer, 109). The combined problems of Pale impropriety and continual Gaelic rebellions left English administrators wary of assimila- tion. Nicholas Canny argues that by 1580 English foreign-policy strate- gists began rethinking strategy, deciding rather to begin "cut[ting] its losses in Ireland and concentrating] on its involvement in domestic and conti- nental involvements" (17). Such reconsideration, however, was not one of dismissive neglect toward the colony. Based on the known collusion with the Spanish and the unregenerate quality of political culture, the sovereign attitude became more hardened toward Ireland as an evil place of Catholic recovery. To use the Spenserian axiom, the "force of the greater strength of reform" was turned toward the unrelenting goal of submissive conquest (Spenser, 47). Brady again summarizes this dramatic policy change:</page><page sequence="9">252 TIM DONOVAN Yet while they retained the conventional extensive of the scope of reform, these administrators adopted a radically different attitude toward its mode of implementation. Because the establishment of the English rule in Ireland was now more urgent than ever, but because neither the Gaelic Irish nor Anglo- Irish could be counted upon to further its establishment by cooperation and accommodation, reform would have to be imposed on Ireland by force. Thus an increasing number of provincial governors and administrators argued that it was necessary and legitimate for them to enforce their authority, and the authority of the law, by coercive means when persuasion failed. (35) Spenser's dialogue enters the political context as a decided advocate of policy changes toward Ireland, "exhorting" his intended audience to rec- ognize the inherent flaws of assimilation (Canny, 18). Through the dialogue's disputation, the classic genre of philosophical reflection, the author proposes the available reform alternatives to suggest the justice nec- essary to regenerate Ireland. It is Spenser's objective to forsake any opti- mism in the constructive virtue of Common Law by the dialogue's conclusion, thus persuading the reader of the necessity of programmatic conquest. Spenser personifies the vying political strategies of assimilation and conquest through the characters Exodus and Irenius. Outlining the range of opposition in the dialogue, Spenser's Exodus represents the conven- tional assurance in the efficacy of government to engender "love, good- ness and civility" (Spenser, 47). In contrast, Irenius disturbs any recourse to the commonplace virtue of civility, justifying the need for the "sword" as the only good means of repressing "licentiousness barbarism" (47). Their dialogue actuates a crucial ethico-political question: "Can there be any evil in any laws" - a question troubled by persistent corruption in Ireland (37). But more important, this is a question that Spenser poses to establish the dialogue's radical premise: that at present there are no laws capable of civilizing this degenerate culture, a claim most troubling to an audience confident in liberal reform. For Spenser, Common Law is a failure not because the law is flawed, but because the law lacks specificity. Further, the reader's ethical disappointment is compounded throughout the dialogue as Spenser extends the disturbing argument that Common Law has actu- ally advanced widespread treachery. The use of Common Law as a means to circumvent justice should indicate the extreme vulgarity of "becoming Irish," a pathology of viral contamination infecting all who are exposed. The infection of the body politic is particularly clear in Spenser's outrage toward the hybridity of the Anglo-Irish Palesman who have become more Irish, vexing themselves by denigrating their own nature. Spenser repre- sents the corruption of the Pale particularly by the impropriety of speaking</page><page sequence="10">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 253 Irish over the native tongue, for it is "unnatural that any people should love another's language more than their own" (105).2 To grasp what surely appears to be a perverse argument of reform, it is necessary to examine the logical specificity of the author's critique as it reached in the dialogue's movement . In sum, the radical reformation that Spenser advises is necessary because Ireland is simply unfit for civility. In Exodus's view, the symp- toms of Irish corruption are numerous, and viewed from a humanist per- spective the whole of Irish nature, society, and culture personifies barbarism.3 Because of the nation's "salvage" state, the only possible man- ner of reform is a total reformation - cleansing this damned site - clearing it away for habits of civility. For Spenser's intended audience, those in favor of traditional reform, the argument's logic develops through several difficult advances of disputation regarding the inherent quality of English culture and law. Early in the dialogue, extending an organic metaphor of "planting" the law in Ireland, Exodus poses the seemingly reasonable ar- gument for the traditional discipline of the halter: I cannot see how that may better be than by the discipline of the laws of En- gland; for the English were at first as stout and warlike a people as ever the Irish, and yet, you see, are now brought unto that civillity, that no nation in the world excelleth them in godly conversation and all the studies of knowl- edge and humanity. (47) His argument responds to Irenius's explanation that details the back- ground of England's own enculturation to the law brought on by the Norman Conquest. According to Irenius, the English accepted the law brought with William's conquering primarily because of the sovereign's forceful resolve. As he continues, the government imposed by the Normans was established and further reinforced by the sword's power. Arguing by comparison for the resolve necessary in Ireland, Irenius claims that in conquering "they followed the execution of them with more severity and was also present in person to overlook the magistrates and to overawe these subjects with the terror of the sword and countenance of his majesty" (46). The saddle of the halter was different for the Irish, however, because their subjection was "otherwise affected" by less pressure (46). Thus, to follow the popular psy- chological narrative of the "troubled child," Ireland is less disciplined and more delinquent in comparison to England. The crucial distinction regard- ing the comparative argument about the fitness of the Irish rests on the England's prior comportment to government before the Norman Conquest</page><page sequence="11">254 TIM DONOVAN (Brady, 42). Therefore, if I understand Spenser's argument, he is claiming that the English had habituated a measure of constitutional law that pre- pared them for governance. The habituated capacity for civil government allowed the English to accept and assimilate the differences without undue disorder, while dominating presence of authority dismissed any rebellion. By contrast, the tribal society of Ireland without the essential "disposi- tion" toward a civil culture and lacking any mediated force of the sover- eign is fundamentally unfit for English reform (46). By consequence, Irenius's remarkable claim that "the laws ought to be fashioned unto the manners and the conditions of the people to whom they are meant, and not to be imposed upon them according to the simple rule of right" appears logical, since Irish culture is utterly lacking in propriety (128).4 Thus, the severe program of "moderation and temperance" called for by Irenius is the moral penalty necessary to reform a habitually degenerate culture (47). As he cautions Exodus, the process of reformation is a complete restruc- turing of nature: "For it is not so easy now that things are grown to change the course, to change the channel, and turn the streams the other way" (46). Ultimately, Spenser's view of the utmost necessity is the need to dis- temper an "unruly" horde, breaking them of their constitutive social or- ders, and, finally, bring them to virtue like Solon educated the Athenians (47). To the reformist Exodus, fearful of radical uprooting, Irenius justifies the necessity of purgation: "For it is vain to prescribe laws where no man careth for keeping them, nor feareth the danger for breaking of them. But all the realm is to be first reformed, and the laws are afterwards to be made for keeping and continuing it in that reformed estate" (133). Within the organic structure that provides the architectonic of Spenser's view, either planting or transplanting the civility of culture is impossible until the bar- ren ground of Ireland is renewed for fertility. Ireland as the proper name of disorder must disappear to become otherwise, the representation of Eng- lishness in Ireland within the assimilating monism of the same. Not surprisingly, historians have remarked that Spenser's critique of political reform had contemporary precedents, generally corresponding with other civil administrators who suggested more aggressive measures of sub- jection through governmental intrusion (Canny, Brady, Palmer, McCabe). The recommendations of an array of civil administrators such as Richard Beacon's Soon His Follie and William Herbert's Croftus sive de Hibernia, are examples of treatises that defended the compelling need for a more defensive force to discipline the Irish (Brady, 37-38). Largely, Spenser's dialogue underlines an apology for his supervisor Lord Grey, justifying his administration of the Munster famine and the brutal resolve deployed in</page><page sequence="12">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 255 the Smerwick executions. For Spenser, Grey is an exemplary figure, repre- senting the measure of principled righteousness necessary to correct the "present state of things" (Spenser, 106). It is Grey's unyielding moral ear- nestness that influences some of Spenser's more disturbing passages con- cerning the rehabilitation of Ireland's "fatal destiny" (35). These terrifying passages not only mark the singularity of the author's prescription for re- form but also the moral vigor of one who has witnessed the effects of its design. The rhetorical force of depicting the Munster agony is consider- able, urging the audience toward a purgative hardness necessary to sustain the dire, but necessary, conclusions. No final critical analysis will pen- etrate the resignation or anxiety that Spenser confronted in Munster, at once repelled by the suffering of enforced starvation but firmly resolved that sacrifice is the necessary course of reformation. The perversity of Spenser's view lies in these grim details: Out of every corner of the woods and glens they came creeping forth upon their hands, for their legs could not bear them. They looked anatomies of death, they spake like ghosts carrying out of their graves, they did eat of the dead carrions, happy were they could find them, yea and one another soon after in so much as the very carcasses they spared not to scrape out of their graves, and if they found a plot of water cress or shamrocks, there they as to a feast for the time, yet not able long to continue therewithal, that in the short space there were none almost left and a most populous and plentiful country sud- denly left void of man or beast ... (143) Like an Old Testament figure that must yield to the unintelligibility of Yahweh's wisdom, Spenser, too, must overcome the inexplicable horror of enforced famine by resolutely accepting that there is "no other means" for Ireland (110). The civilizing conquest of Ireland is an issue of provi- dential duty, resignified within the biblical authority, as the Irish are fig- ured within the lineage of the "cursed seed of Essau" (107). Paul Stevens notes that Spenser's primary source of ethical authority in the Faerie Queene and in the View is the influence of Old Testament Wisdom literature, with its emphasis on the omnipotent authority of Yahweh's justice (158). The famine that Spenser imagines is a means of cleansing the Irish of their stubborn ways is similar to Yahweh's treatment of Job and the evil commu- nities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Within a discourse of reform and continual purification, Spenser presupposes that there is nothing so natural as estab- lishing order and nothing so unnatural as ignoring it (158). Within this intensely religious historical period, the author is compelled to enact the destiny of the biblical covenant in Ireland, necessitating the reinvigoration</page><page sequence="13">256 TIM DONOVAN of apocalyptic destiny, a merger of morality and politics for the New Jeho- vah, witnessed by the severe reformer Grey, who invites comparison to the great Old Testament figures, faithfully steadfast in Yahweh's wisdom. Spenser designs the scene of pathological malignancy deploying an or- ganic structure, and I want to analyze these tropes on the figurai level of argumentation. To view the heterotopic scene of disorder and corruption, Spenser introduces the quintessential opposition between nature and culture, con- trasting the original natural climate of the Irish countryside, in opposition to a nomadic community without the habits of civility. Nature is detailed in its primordial purity, an untainted pastoral topology denigrated by the proper name of evil - Ireland. Spenser writes about the wholesomeness: [the] most beautiful and sweet country as any is under heaven, being stored throughout with many goodly rivers, replenished with all sorts of fish most abundantly, sprinkled with many sweet islands and goodly lakes, like little inland seas, that will carry even ships upon their waters; adorned with goodly woods, even fit for building of houses and ships so commodiously, as that, if some princes in the world had them, they would hope to be lords of all the seas, and ere along for all the world. . . besides the soil itself, most fertile, fit to yield all kind of fruit that shall be committed thereunto. And lastly, the heavens most mild and temperate, though somewhat more moist than the parts toward the west. (55) The effect of this description is not merely to depict an Edenic land- scape of intrinsic beauty or of inherent natural resources. Rather, the struc- tural ideal of perfection is reopened within the heterotopia by reference to the symmetry of organic nature. While Spenser's remarks seem conflicted, at once figuring Ireland as the "most beautiful," while also castigating it as "savage soyl," the castigations do not suggest an original toxicity but rather degeneration fomented by the viral Irish rot. Thus, a corrupted community contaminates an orderly nature; nevertheless, the essential substance of nature remains the potential ground of reclamation, providing fit suste- nance for a reformed community. In persuading the audience to accept the invasive rehabilitation that he foresees, Spenser extends the dialogue's organic trope through figura- tive appeals to the pathology of the Irish. The "strong hand" recommended by Exodus is figured comparatively to the responsible doctor confronted by the desperation of a terminal patient proceeding with aggression (133). Following the Spenserian analogy, the medical code of ethics prohibits the "physician to wish his patient dead, rather [it] demands to apply the best</page><page sequence="14">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 257 endeavor of his skill for his recovery" (36). Thus, the harsh "diet" pre- scribed in the author's diagnosis necessitates a complete purgation of the body politic indisposed to recurative capacity (37). To restore a healthy ecology where civilization can be transplanted, the strong hand of the sword must attack like a surgeon's scalpel removing the malignancy for a healthy recovery. Spenser's reformation medicine repeatedly predicates a radical cutting away to the essential roots. As he argues figuratively about the cor- rupted Irish nature: [F]or all the evils must first be cut away by the strong hand before any good can be planted; like as the corrupt branches and the unwholesome boughs are first to be pruned and the foul moss cleansed and scraped away before the tree can bring forth any good fruit. (134) Finally, only through the eradication of evil will the wild fruit of Ireland be palatable and domesticated to English tastes. Once Ireland recovers from the disease of brutishness and continual "warring," it will be disciplined and thus ready for the halter of civilization, which would be an enculturation that concludes with programs that are not far from the earlier reforms that Spenser found misdirected. Ultimately, the author's view presumes that reformation can begin only by the necessity of destroying absolutely what Ireland signifies. Poised before infinite perfectibility of God's call to purify and the humanistic goal of moral virtue, Spenser must cut away all that has im- planted itself within nature in a cleansing purification. In this rhetoric of pathology, England represents a branch in the organic growth of the Refor- mation and progressive humanism that is threatened by the viral offshoot, Ireland. The necessity of extermination as an end that purifies and restores the promise of community is deeply rooted in Christianity influenced by the Old Testament, a legacy that gave power to the Reformation. Within this dialogue, reform can mean nothing other than submission to the word of God and the virtuous political ends of a humanist commonwealth. 3. Faced with Spenser's advice, a contemporary reader might conclude that the political determinations are simply another episode in the ongoing co- lonial project. In sum, the English appear oppressive in their socio-cultural</page><page sequence="15">258 TIM DONOVAN domination and the Irish appear oppressed by English domination. With this summation, this episode might lead to this conclusion: Irish good, English bad. Another judgment might as easily conclude that the dialogue exemplifies the acceptable limitations of social consensus. After all, the View proposes the available means of building a lawful commonwealth, advice that observes the conventional political wisdom and cultural tradi- tions within the historical context. In his confrontation with difficult po- litical matters, should we condemn Spenser for being a good statesman-humanist? I believe that both of these evaluative courses fall short of the many problems that lie beneath the dialogue's presuppositions, principles that outline the conceptual legacy of community. How is it that the common and the familiar a continually troubled by difference? Alphonso Lingis offers a very telling question, when he asks: How do we identify with those who offer us so little or nothing in common? Lingis's troubling question has been addressed by Jürgen Habermas's model of communicative rationality, a consensus model of collective ethi- cal reflection. Influenced by the Frankfurt School, he recognizes that utili- tarian, instrumental reason dominates the ethico-social horizon of thought. However, unlike Adorno, Habermas believes positively in the Enlighten- ment promise of a community directed by progressive rational communi- cation linked to normative ideals. The basis of Habermas's theory is founded on the argument that within our linguistic practices there remains a normative guideline that represents a grammar of deep rationality. For him this position was made evident in his presumption that human nature has the capacity for recognizing the truth through purposeful communicative activity. The process of reaching the truth necessitates an unconstrained dialogue built on the mutual com- mitment of others to make good their truth claims. For Habermas, the ulti- mate veracity of truth statements must satisfy "the good life" (1989, 273). The good life is reached through the process of communicative rationality that is established through a network of intersubjective engagement, where the claims of each subject is mediated in reference to the perspective of the other: Only the communicative model of action presupposes language as a medium of uncurtailed communication whereby speakers and hearers, out of the con- text of their preinterpreted lifeworld refer simultaneously to things in the ob- jective, social, and subjective worlds in order to negotiate common definitions of the situation. This interpretive concept of language lies behind the various efforts to develop a formal pragmatics (150)</page><page sequence="16">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 259 A subject recognizes difference in the variation of the other's subjectivity, synthesizing perspectives in reference to the truthful horizon of the lifeworld. Yet determining the validity of true statements that define the characteristics of this "good life" is rather complex and troublesome be- cause these principles are not given through an ethical discussion, but in- stead lie beneath all discussion. The life world is a transcultural grammar of reference that regulates the norms guiding the rational movement of communication. As the condition of possibility for any meaning, the lifeworld remains in "the background of the participants - as an intu- itively known, unproblematic, and unanalyzable holistic background. The speech situation is the segment of the lifeworld tailored to the relevant theme; it both forms a context and furnishes resources for the processes of mutual understanding" (298). The impasse of difference that Lingis' pre- sents, then, is seemingly overcome because any legitimate intersubjective communication must first respect the rational presuppositions of the other in a process of mutual understanding that determines the validity and es- tablishes a consensus for contextual knowledge. As a guarantee of coop- eration, Habermas has specified that: "Only those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet) with the approval of all affected in their capacity as participants in practical discourse" (1990, 66). More impor- tant, a consensus of approval is reached by discussion that neutralizes the forces of interest and reification so that the persuasive power of the un- forced-force prevails. Habermas has reconstituted a dialectical system of consensus that connects the context bound historical moment with univer- sals in a movement toward truth. Finally, the Habermasian community is commanded by the imperative to make reason reasonable, an accomplish- ment, ultimately, that may intensify rather than relieve the problems of community. Yet, in the View, the subaltern Irish has no participation, and is evalu- ated exclusively from a lifeworld that presupposes English and humanist values. And while that the View is surely constrained, limited to a very interested consensus, I believe that Habermas's trust in the power of un- constrained dialogue is here shown as wishful or worse dangerous. The threat to his theory of consensus lies in the importance placed in the lifeworld as a ground of propositional logos. As the ethical background of communicative rationality, the transcendence of the lifeworld emerges in a double-gesture established first in a rhetorical move of affirmation, which is then validated through the authority of grammar (Meyer, 18). In other words, the universal projection of a lifeworld is a duplicitous movement</page><page sequence="17">260 TIM DONOVAN that reconstitutes and validates an already constituted knowledge. I be- lieve that it would take a tremendous amount of power - force that would not result from mutual understanding - to realize the humanist/ reforma- tion worldview that substantiates the dialogue. The ethics informing unity, virtue, and morality implicitly expressed in the organic figure of nature is never open to interpretation because it is the norm structured as an ideal that provides the context of meaning implied throughout the View. Univer- sal pragmatics is tautalogical because the ethical background that guides normative commitments to communicative rationality is simply an ideal- ized consensus that presumes the discussion in advance. Thus, the Habermasian community is myopic, a circumscribed we enclosed within an anthropomorphic horizon of normative meaning. It begins with the fa- miliar to finally recognize itself. While considering the tautalogical basis of consensus, we should also consider other problems of deliberation within Habermas's work. Namely, in what neutral field of concern would the force-of-an-unforced-force emerge? In examining this neutral field, it is questionable whether it is indeed possible to remove the force of argument from the rhetorical fig- ures and context. My point is that rather than reducing coercion, Habermasian negotiation seems to increase coercive force. The power nec- essary to produce agreement and social change seems more likely to occur by marshaling and intensifying force that would overpower an existing normative consensus rather than promote cooperation. Anthony Cascardi insightfully cautions us about the Habermasian consensus: "it remains un- clear whether 'intersubjectivity' represents anything more than the mutual domination of subjects" (273). The domination that extends over Habermas's universal pragmatics is the reflection of Hegel's legacy, a system of unification in which any form of difference is absorbed within the domination of an absolute (273). For Hegel, the self-enclosed subject turns outward to the other to assimi- late its difference to further extend self-recognition. Dialectics is a con- sumptive system of compliance that must appropriate the other within the realm of the familiar. Rather than cooperation, the Hegelian needs to domi- nate the other by assimilating its difference to itself. In sum, the mediation of self and other within the Hegelian system produces a community of mastery in the conflict of commanding all within the authority of the fa- miliar in the ongoing historical movement of the absolute: a cultural domi- nance that is exemplified in the View by a politics presupposed by the necessity of submission to the propriety of humanism, an absolute that is a actually a euphemism for the assimilation of difference.</page><page sequence="18">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 26 1 The legacy of the community formed by being-in-common is estab- lished on the principle of assimilation governed by an absolute that con- sumes difference. This foundational order is exemplified, according to Jacques Derrida, in Plato's Statesman by the weaving that crafts the symploke. Here the architectonic of weaving is the orienting metaphor characterizing the king's prudent political perception to unify. In Dissemi- nation, Derrida reads the symploke's formation as an exemplary indication of the deeply embedded necessity for unity not only within our philosophi- cal tradition, but also in the community that it presupposes. However, the important consequence of a woven, unified pattern is that any strand that resists conforming to the structure's common pattern must be excluded. A designed exclusion marks philosophy's fundamental limits, but a pattern of conformity establishes the principle of community itself. Plato's paradigm of an orderly polis begins with the craftsmen's work, a craft of braiding the most pliable and supportive material into an object. By contrast, the king's responsibilities exceed the challenges of the weaver, because the achievement of political unity and cohesion must confront con- flicts of multiple perspectives, differing values, incompatible abilities, in- flexible positions and more. The crucial issue for Plato, and also for Derrida, is that the king forms this cohesiveness by a labor of negating oppositions, plying the resistant strands into conformity. Emphasizing the point of ex- pertise and necessity, Derrida understands Plato arguing comparatively that a sensible artist would use only compatible materials; however, the statesman's art requires more difficulty. Difficulty implies the decision to cut: the statesman must discard those opposing strands failing to conform. Beyond establishing a fundamental mechanism of hierarchy, the conse- quence of Plato's arrangement for Derrida is that "dialectics [itself] is ba- sically the art of the symploke," a device that bonds all heterogeneity into a formative unity (1981, 122). Derrida's point is that order itself, the struc- ture of the "entire history of the concept of the structure" has always orga- nized itself within the coherence of a total form (1980, 279). Ultimately, the structure that presupposes structure itself is fundamentally ordered by unity, a pattern where all differences and resistance are brought together in assimilation. At last, I believe the conceptual legacy of community emerges within this foundational structure, a design that directs the principle of community toward eschatological culmination. In the writing of Jean-Luc Nancy we encounter the consequences of such a direction, where assimila- tion relieves itself in consummation. Nancy's writing cautions us that the Holocaust, Stalinist purges, and countless other atrocities were not momentary political outbursts that ex-</page><page sequence="19">262 TIM DONOVAN ploded in the 1940s; the conflict of community rages on and the contempo- rary names Khmer Rouge, Somalia, and "ethnic cleansing" serve as in- dexes for the consumptive energy within community. In writing the "most painful problem of the modern world: the conflagration of community," Nancy bears witness to the fascism and totalitarianism of the past century that eradicated communities by the same principles that upheld the con- cept of community itself (1). In fact, Nancy believes that the concept of community is nearly exhausted as a result of an immanent absolutism that orients the Western episteme. Nancy believes that the concept of commu- nity is nearly exhausted as a result of an immanent absolutism that orients the western episteme. More important, Nancy understands that such a foun- dational absolute constitutes an impossible logic that engenders perma- nent conflict: The absolute must be the absolute of its own absoluteness, or not be at all. In other words: to be absolutely alone, it is not enough that I be so; I must also be alone being alone - and this of course is contradictory. The logic of the absolute violates the absolute. It implicates it in a relation that it refuses and precludes by its essence. This relation tears and forces open, from within and without at the same time, and from outside that is nothing other than the re- jection of an impossible interiority, the "without relation" from which the absolute would constitute itself. (4) The point of this highly abstract definition is that any form of an absolute pretends to be utterly nonrelational. Specifically, the primacy of an abso- lute is actually a violent hierarchy predicated on denying any relational difference. The tearing forth of an inner essence noted by Nancy is the structural necessity of a relationship that is sublated within a reserve that maintains authority and institutes its own transcendence. As he implies, an absolute must exercise authority over another; otherwise, it remains alone and exposed as a contradiction. The conflicted logic of "absolutism" is an economy that sets forth an impossible desire for "immanence" projected toward an ideal essence that is finally lacking. The conflicted basis of any form of absolute immanence becomes clear when we refer to contemporary examples of communities based on ideals of authenticity and integrity. They remain in continual conflict - torn from within and out - attempting to realize an impossible goal. The preliminary stakes of Nancy's deconstructive writing is an im- portant contribution that establishes a relationship between the philosophi- cal grounds of absolutism and the political emergence of totalitarianism.</page><page sequence="20">COMMUNITY, ASSIMILATION, AND THE UNFAMILIAR 263 For Nancy, the human subject "is set in relation" with an image of the absolute, and naturally the investment is conflicted because there can be no relationship "between two or several absolutes" (4). The monad named the individual is alienated separated from oneself and from others and in this isolation longs to discover its inner essence. This condition of separa- tion inevitably institutes a political realm to settle the "unappeasable com- bat" that results from the confrontation of isolated individuals drawn toward immanence (5). And the View exemplifies the ongoing conflict of mutual dominance diagnosed by Nancy. Nancy's analysis is most significant when he identifies how the alien- ation of "being-separate" is transformed into nostalgic perspective when individual alienation is overcome with the idea of reforming a "lost or bro- ken" unity. In this transformation of the absolute, immanence is actualized in an organicist form ordered by a nostalgic longing for a lost age in which community was woven of tight, harmonious, and in- frangible bonds and in which above all it played back to itself, through its institutions, its rituals, and its symbols, the representation, indeed the living offering, of its own immanent unity, intimacy, and autonomy. (9) For Nancy, Christianity is a mythology that embodies and transforms the relational impossibility of the absolute through unification. When transcen- dence becomes immanent, community is established through communion. In Christianity the nostalgia is not for a lost age, for it begins fallen in Genesis and lives on the messianic promise of a redemptive future that will bring forth an eschatological culmination. From Nancy's perspective, the eschatology of the Christian ethos influences an ideal of community drawn toward a completion in ecstatic communion. At last, a union that reaches toward a totality that Nancy believes is the legacy of modern forms of totalitarianism. In conclusion, I believe the political stakes of the dialogue are grounded in eschatological presuppositions that inform the humanistic va- lences assumed normative throughout the View. Specifically, I refer to eschatology, not entirely in the traditional sense of an end or last things, but more so as form of closure, a unified order governed by what Nancy refers to as a "nonrelational" unified absolute. The substance that grounds the humanist influences throughout the dialogue is a unified organic basis of a nature that authenticates the laws of natural habits and proper gover- nance. A unified organic basis where propriety of tradition is perfected</page><page sequence="21">264 TIM DONOVAN under the proper name of English customs and laws, an order that enforces communion and represents anything that resists this order as improper and evil. In this dialogue of pathology, a Reformation sense of historical reha- bilitation intermixes with the moral civility of humanism with the hope of purifying and converting this heterotopic force of disease. Spenser sense of cure seeks finality. But community cannot be an end in itself because it will end. It will end because only the familiar will come. It will end because we will finally know nothing other. It will end in itself. If community has any future, as Nancy has indicated, that posterity will be an unfamiliar work. Department of English The Pennsylvania State University Notes 1 . Historians such as Brendan Bradshaw (1979) have questioned the seriousness of Spanish intervention in Ireland. 2. The propriety of natural language in the View as it relates to the propriety of the nation suggests the work of Derrida (1976). For him, the primacy of the proper is substantiated by a structure of ontotheology. 3. The list of grievances against the Irish is lengthy: their agricultural means, heretical and primitive religion, mixed and corrupt genealogy, corrupted language, general lawless- ness, incestuous marriages, wasteful use of resources, violence, laziness, fllthiness, exces- sive grief at funerals, thievery, clothing that augments thievery, and surely the Pogues, if not more. 4. Ciaran Brady (1989) argues that "fitting the law to specific conditions admits a dis- turbing claim that English law is constructed and not an organic entity that developed and expanded throughout the history of the community." Thus, the law is relative and "imposed by the powerful" (43). Works Cited Bradshaw, Brendan. 1979. The Irish Constitutional Revolution of the Sixteenth Century.
