<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anatomical Method, Natural Theology, and the Functions of the Brain By William F. Bynum* The use of every organ has been discovered by starting from the assumption that it must have some use. -WILLIAM WHEWELL** I. INTRODUCTION ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES underlying the traditional practice of both physiology and natural theology has been the belief that the various functions of living organisms are intimately connected to corresponding structures. On the one hand this adaptation of structure to function was generally taken as proof of design (and of a Designer), and much natural theology from Francis Bacon and John Ray to Paley and the Bridgewater Treatises consisted simply of repetitiously cataloguing such adaptations. On the other hand, these same adaptations were accepted virtually a priori as the result of design, thereby giving anatomists and physiologists license to assume that every organic structure has its own proper function or functions. Functionless organic structure was anathema equally to the physiologist and the natural theologian.' This structure/function correlation has thus traditionally played a dual role-as both the proof and the result of design-and one consequence has been an essential circularity of the argument from design. Natural theologians have assumed that which they have ostensibly sought to prove. Another aspect of this intimate relationship of form and function has been the historical fusion of anatomy and physiology. The ultimate goal of anatomy has always been physiology-that is, functional anatomy- and one of the most powerful methodological tools of earlier physiologists was dissection. As Lloyd G. Stevenson has remarked, until the nineteenth century it was a commonplace that "inference from anatomical fact is the royal road to [physiological] Received Oct. 1972: revised/accepted Apr. 1973. *University College, London, England.

BYNUM discovery."2 It was this subtle fusion of considerations of the structures of organs with their functions which makes Galen's De usu partium simultaneously a treatise of anatomy and of physiology and which makes Charles Singer's Anatomy and Physiology from the Greeks to Harvey one story, not two. The inference from anatomy to physiology constitutes the fundamental character- istic of what I have called the anatomical method. It was based on the assumption that the more one knew of structure, the better one understood function. A commit- ment to this method can be found implicitly or explicitly in the work of many figures from Aristotle to the great functional anatomists of the eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries, such as Vicq d'Azyr, John Hunter, Cuvier, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Oken, and Richard Owen.3 The method was also central to the work of the seventeenth- century physician with whom I am principally concerned in the present essay: Thomas Willis. His investigations demonstrate two important features of the method in general. First there was a high premium placed on comparative anatomy. Structures differ from species to species; so do functions. One obvious way of elucidating the structure/function relationship is to compare the relationship in different species. As one eighteenth-century anatomist expressed it, "If we would understand physiology and reason on the Functions in the Animal Oeconomy, we must see how the same End is brought about in other Species."4 Albrecht von Haller reflected the same belief: "The situation, figure and size of parts ought to be learned from man; their figure and motions must be drawn from animals."5 As we shall see, Willis made fundamental use of comparative dissections. But his work also illustrates a second feature of the anatomical method-its limitations. The method could be employed to elucidate the functions of organs and organ systems which are susceptible to a nice degree of mechanical analysis: the structure of the skeleton and the relations of the bones to the origins and insertions of the muscles; details of posture and movement; the anatomy and mechanical actions of the eye; the comparative anatomy of the digestive system and the connections between structures such as teeth, beaks, claws, gizzards, and multiple stomachs to the dietary habits of the species under consideration; the structure of the heart and the circulation of the blood. In the structure/function relationship the latter is the more difficult to determine, except at the purely mechanical level. Insofar as a living organism is like a machine with functions resulting from its gross structural characteristics, the anatomi- cal method could contribute to the understanding of function. But as function was increasingly conceived in physico-chemical categories by the experimental physiologists of the nineteenth century, anatomical reasoning played a diminished part in physio- logical discovery. Function was still recognized as structurally connected, but in 2Lloyd G. Stevenson, "Anatomical Reasoning in Physiological Thought," in Chandler McC. Brooks and Paul F. Cranefield, eds., The Historical Development of Physiological Thought (New York: Hafner, 1959), pp. 27-38. The relation of anatomy and physiology is also discussed by Gerald L. Geison, "Social and Institutional Factors in the Stagnancy of English Physiology, 1840-1870," Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 1972, 46: 30-58. 3 The anatomical tradition was lucidly sketched by T. H. Huxley, "Owen's Position in the History of Anatomical Science," in R. Owen, The Life of Richard Owen (London: John Murray, 1894), Vol. II, pp. 273-332. 4 From the anonymous introductory letter to Alexander Munro, primus, An Essay on Com- parative Anatomy (London, 1744), p. 10. 5 Quoted by William Lawrence, Lectures on Physiology, Zoology, and the Natural History of Man (6th ed., London: John Cox, 1834), p. 57.</page><page sequence="4">ANATOMICAL METHOD AND BRAIN FUNCTION 447 practice morphology was separated from physiology.6 There is a gap distancing the kind of functional analyses attempted by anatomists like Hunter and Cuvier from those of physiologists like Magendie, Bernard, and Ludwig.7 Thomas Willis on the other hand applied the anatomical method to a system with functions not so easily elucidated as those of the circulatory or musculo-skeletal system. His major interest was the structure and functions of the nervous system. In some respects it might appear susceptible to anatomical analysis, for dramatic structural variations occur throughout the animal kingdom, and these variations are accompanied by equally striking functional differences. But the nervous system presented problems of considerable magnitude: not only were its operations as com- plex as they were obscure, but treacherous theological and metaphysical issues were involved. Willis met these issues head on, and from the mixture of anatomy, physiology, metaphysics, and theology which constitutes his work two sometimes conflicting views of man's nervous system emerge: (1) that it is much more complicated and refined than the nervous system of any other animal, anatomical proof that God created man as a rational creature and animals as irrational creatures; (2) that the nervous systems of man and the quadrupeds are so analogously constructed, so similar in form and function, that some immaterial principle in man must be postu- lated in order to account for the mental differences between men and animals. Is man a more complicated animal or is he an animal with something added? Do his superior mental faculties have anatomical representation or do they result from an immaterial principle working more or less independently of his brain, which after all looks much like the brain of a dog or a monkey? How far does the correlation of structure and function extend ? If to the nervous system, then to all portions and for all faculties ? This paper is concerned with the two attitudes toward these kinds of questions in several late-seventeenth-century English thinkers. In the main body of the paper I analyze the ways in which Thomas Willis used the anatomical method to elaborate his theories of neurological and mental functions. I suggest that the inconsistencies in his own work are bound up with his general notions of the relationship of structure and function and with his inability to deal with any structureless function. In the next section I briefly show that the same kind of tensions are present in the natural theology of the period. In a brief conclusion I suggest some of the pathways whereby this set of queries was transmitted into the nineteenth century. II. THOMAS WILLIS AND THE IPLICATIONS OF COMPARATIVE NEUROANATOMY Thomas Willis (1621-1675) enjoyed in his day an ample measure of worldly success. He developed a large and lucrative medical practice, first in Oxford, then in London, which by the mid 1660s earned him ?300 a year-at a time when a cook at an Oxford college received an annual wage of ?2, and the butler of Trinity College earned 26/8.8 With the patronage of Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, Willis became Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford, after the Restora- 6 A point made by Huxley, Life of Richard Owen, Vol. II, pp. 275-277. 7 Geison, op. cit.; William Coleman, "Les organismes marins et l'anatomie comparee dit experimentale: L'oeuvre de Georges Cuvier," Vit et milieu, 1965, Supplement 19: 30-58. 8 Kenneth Dewhurst, Thomas Willis as a Physician (Los Angeles: William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, 1964), p. 12,</page><page sequence="5">448 WILLIAM F. BYNUM tion. He was also one of the group of Oxford virtuosi who were instrumental in the foundation of the Royal Society. The title pages of his books advertise him as a Fellow of the Royal Society and (more significantly for his medical reputation) of the "renowned College of Physicians in LONDON." His writings brought him fame both in England and abroad; at least eight editions of his Opera omnia were published on the Continent between 1676 and 1720.9 While Willis' contemporary reputation was substantial, his historical one has been less secure. He has invariably been compared with his countryman Thomas Sydenham, and the more formal, traditional writings of the high church Royalist pale beside the bouyant empiricism of the Puritan cavalry officer. Willis' very eminence as a practicing physician has been used as a stick with which to beat him: it is well known, for example, that he collaborated in his researches with a number of Oxford virtuosi, including Richard Lower, Christopher Wren, Robert Hooke, and Thomas Millington, and historians like Michael Foster have suggested that Willis could have had no time for research, being so busy seeing patients. The implication of course is that Willis published under his own name work which was done primarily by his younger colleagues.10 While it is now impossible to determine the proportions of the work produced by the various members of Willis' circle, it is significant that none of his collaborators ever intimated that he had been exploited. Furthermore, as Charles Webster has recently pointed out, collaborative research (with single-author publica- tion) was a common practice among the group of seventeenth-century Oxford scientists.1" It is thus not difficult to defend Willis against the charge of parasitic collaboration, and when the whole corpus of his work is examined, as Isler has done, both the breadth and depth of his thought become apparent.12 Willis left four separate treatises which were concerned with the anatomy, physi- ology, pathology, and therapy of the neuromuscular system: Cerebri anatome (1664), De morbis convulsivis (1667), De motu musculari ... (1670), and De anima brutorum (1672). The first and the last are the most substantial, the Anatomy of the Brain being a classic foundation of neuroanatomical investigations, while The Soul of Brutes is a major statement of the principles and practice of seventeenth-century psychiatry. 9There were editions at Lyon (1676, 1681), Geneva (1676, 1680, 1694), Amsterdam (1682), and Venice (1708, 1720). His works were translated into English in 1684 by Samuel Pordage. The standard work on Willis is Hansruedi Isler, Thomas Willis (New York: Hafner, 1968).

"Man," he wrote, is a "two-soul'd Animal."'3 He possesses both a corporeal, or sensitive, soul, which he shares with animals, and a rational soul, which is uniquely human. The corporeal soul is in its actions co- extensive with the human or animal body. Its agencies are three: the "vital liquor" of the blood, the "Animal Liquor or Nervous Juyce" of the brain and nerves, and the "Genital or Spermatic Juyce," which is a distillation of the other two humors. Thus, in actual fact the functions of the corporeal soul include all the functions of the animal body, but in The Soul of Brutes Willis confined himself principally to corporeal functions of the neuromuscular system. These functions include sensation, motion, memory, perception, imagination, reflex action, and instinctive behavior (SB 18-19). It is these nervous or mental functions which men and animals share by virtue of the common possession of a corporeal soul.'4 Animals thus have souls, but man is a two-souled creature. He boasts a rational soul, a concept which in Willis' work has obvious theological connotations. Whereas the corporeal soul is material, the rational soul is immaterial. The former perishes with the body, while the latter is immortal (SB 1). The rational soul is that principle which makes man a reasoning, knowing, judging, thinking, and willing creature. It is the God-given element which connects the material world of earth with the spiritual world of heaven. Man is the animal amphibiumn, part matter and part spirit, standing with his feet on the ground but his eyes directed upwards (SB 41). The rational soul qualitatively separates man from brute. W{illis' categorization (couched in the evocative metaphors of his day) of the relationship between animals, men, and spiritual essence was not original. Descartes, Digby, and Gassendi-three seventeenth-century thinkers whom Willis himself acknowledged-had all produced versions of such a scheme. Descartes' strictly dualistic philosophy was widely discussed during the century, and Sir Kenelm Digby was one of the few Englishmen prepared to accept the Cartesian model of the "beast machine."15 Descartes postulated that animals are merely complicated machines, reacting to stimuli but devoid of consciousness or perceptions. Man on the other hand is a machine to which has been added a thinking, reasoning soul. 16Pierre Gassendi strongly criticized the Cartesian animal-machine hypothesis, proposing instead an alternative from which Willis borrowed extensively. Gassendi recognized two kinds of souls, sensitive and rational. He insisted that animals possess a primitive form of reason, and at one point he even suggested that the mental differences between men 13 Thomas Willis, Two Discourses concerning the Soul of Brutes, preface. Quotations are taken from the English translation of Samuel Pordage, Dr Willis's Practice of Physick (London, 1684). The Soul of Brutes and The Anatomy of the Brain will be abbreviated SB and AB. 14 Corporeal, brutal, and sensitive soul are all used synonymously in Willis' writings. 15 On the concepts of "animal soul" and "' animal automata" see R. M. Young, "Animal Soul," in Paul Edwards, ed., The Encyclopedia of Philosophy (New York: Macmillan, 1967), Vol. I, pp. 122-127; Leonora Cohen Rosenfield, From Beast-Machine to Man-Machine (2nd ed., New York: Octagon Books, 1968); Hester Hastings, Man and Beast in French Thought of the Eighteenth Century (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Studies in Romance Literature and Languages, 1936). 16 The classic formulation of Cartesian dualism is found in the Discourse on Method, in The Philosophical Works of Descartes, trans. E. S. Haldane and G. R. T. Ross (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), Vol. I, pp. 79-130.</page><page sequence="7">450 WILLIAM F. BYNUM and animals are merely quantitative."7 Generally, however, Gassendi's classification of souls recognized the absolute difference between the material, sensitive soul and the immaterial (immortal), rational soul. Willis' position was thus mid-way between the Cartesian model and that of Gassendi. Like the latter he called man a two-souled creature, but he denied animals any form of reason. Instead, he believed that all complicated animal actions are the result of instincts modified by memory and experience (SB 37-38). For our purposes, however, the significance of Willis' notions comes from the kind of justification which he offers. Descartes' stated reasons for his strict demarcation of mind from matter are essentially metaphysical: the "I" of the Cogito, ergo sum is (according to Descartes himself) entirely distinct from the body, since "I" could conceive that I had no body, but could not conceive that "I" could not think (i.e., had no mind). The "thinking I" is therefore mind divorced from body.18 Similarly, Digby and Gassendi were princi- pally concerned with the metaphysical and theological proofs of the Cartesian philoso- phy. Willis, however, though alive to the theological implications of his conception of the soul, appeals not to introspection but to anatomy for his justification. In particular, he considers the limitations of the anatomical method as an adequate guide in determining the functions of the brain to be proof that man possesses an immaterial principle denied to animals. We shall examine this aspect of his thought after looking at his use of the anatomical method. That the structures of the brain are intimately related to the functions of that organ is a proposition underlying all of Willis' works on the nervous system. As he tells us in the Cerebri anatome, ... by the frequent dissection of all sorts of living Creatures ... I shall shew the com- munities and differences which the subjected parts [of the brain] obtain in various Animals, compared among themselves, and with man; certainly from such a compared Anatomy, not only the faculties and uses of every Organ, but the impressions, influences, and secret ways of working of the sensitive Soul it self will be discovered.... A com- pared Anatomy may yield us a more full and exact Physiology of the Use of Parts. (AB 46, 61.) Eight years later, while meditating in The Soul of Brutes on the possible functions of the "streaked bodies" (corptus striatum), he comments, As to the Offices and Uses of the streaked Bodies, though we can discern nothing with our eyes, or handle with our hands, of these things that are done within the secret Conclave or Closset of the Brain; yet, by the effects, and by comparing rationally the Faculties, and Acts, with the Workmanship of the Machine, we may at least conjecture, what sort of works of the Animal Function, are performed in these or those, or within some other parts of the Head. (SB 27.) To compare the "Acts" with the "Workmanship of the Machine" was of course the essence of the anatomical method. The comparisons were of a double nature: within 17 Gassendi's criticisms of the Cartesian animal-machine hypothesis are stated in his "Objections" to Descartes' Meditations, in Philosophical Works of Descartes, Vol. II, pp. 144-146.

Both halves of the method were generally employed, but different kinds of problems naturally lent themselves to one approach or the other. Harvey in his work on the circulation made more use of the former, his comparative anatomy being mostly an elaboration of what he could show from a single species.'9 For Willis' research on the brain, however, comparison between species was more im- portant. His Cerebri anatome furnishes numerous examples, of which two should suffice to give an idea of the ways in which he employed comparative anatomy. In Willis' physiology the cerebral cortex has a double office: the elaboration of animal spirits and the seat of the faculty of memory. That these are the functions of this particular part of the brain was suggested to him by the fact that man, whose memory is so remarkable, also presents the most highly developed cerebral cortex: These folds or rollings about [convolutions] are far more and greater in a man than in any other living Creature, to wit, for the various and manifold actings of the superior Faculties; but they are garnished with an uncertain, and as it were fortuitous series, that the exercises of the animal Function might be free and changeable, and not deter- mined to one. Those Gyrations or Turnings about in four footed beasts are fewer, and in some, as in a Cat, they are found to be in a certain figure and order: wherefore this Brute thinks on, or remembers scarce any thing but what the instincts and needs of Nature suggest. In the lesser four-footed beasts, also in Fowls and Fishes, the super- ficies of the brain being plain and even, wants all cranklings and turnings about: where- fore these sort of Animals comprehend or learn by imitation fewer things, and those almost only of one kind; for that in such, distinct cells, and parted one from another, are wanting, in which the divers Species and Ideas of things are kept apart. (AB 76.) Willis' subtle shifts from anatomy to psychology and back again are here apparent. The cerebrum must be the seat of faculties in which man excels, since that portion of the brain is more complicated in man. Memory, imitation-perhaps even learning- are such faculties, and by locating them in the cerebral hemispheres Willis can provide anatomical correlation for the observation that human behavior is less stereotyped, less instinctive, than that of quadrupeds like the cat, that "thinks on, or remembers scarce any thing but what the instincts and needs of Nature suggest." Similarly, Willis' speculations on the functions of the cerebellum are based on his anatomical observation that cerebellar structure varies relatively little from species to species, combined with the fact that nerves arising from or near this portion of the brain "serve to the Functions, wont to be performed by the Instinct of Nature, or the force of the Passions, rather than by the beck of the Will" (AB 91). For, as he continued, We took notice,. . . that in all Animals, although they differ in form and kind, yet the figure of the Cerebel is always very like or wholly the same. The Brain [i.e., cerebrum] and oblong Marrow are figured in many [species] after a divers manner, . . . [But in man, four-footed beasts, fowls, and fishes] the Cerebel, furnished wholly with the same lappets or little circles alike infolded one in another, is marked with the same form and proportion; which certainly is a sign that the animal Spirits in this work-house are begotten and dispensed ... for certain necessary offices, which are performed in all after "'Harvey's use of "anatomical reasoning" is discussed in Stevenson's article, in Brooks and Cranefield, eds., Historical Development.</page><page sequence="9">452 WILLIAM F. BYNUM the same manner; and which cannot be any other than the motions and actions of the Viscera and Praecordia. As to the other Faculties, of which sort are Imagination, Memory, Appetite, [and even] local motions and sense [they] are exercised after one manner in those living Creatures and after another manner in others; wherefore their brains [cerebrums] are formed after a divers manner. But the motions of the Heart and Respiration in all endued with an hot blood, are performed after a like manner, that is, with a perpetual vicissitude of Systoles and Diastoles. (AB 92.) With the cerebrum variable form meant for Willis variable function. For the cere- bellum the obverse obtains: a much greater degree of structural constancy from species to species means that the cerebellar functions must relate to "offices, which are performed in all after the same manner." The autonomic functions best fulfill that characteristic. These two examples are sufficient to indicate the extent to which Willis relied on the anatomical method and some of the strengths and limitations of that method as it could be applied to the brain. Willis used the method conscientiously. He was an avid dissector; he had, he tells us, "slain so many Victims, whole Hecatombs almost of all Animals, in the Anatomical Court" that he was in a position to compare the structures of different regions of the nervous system in a wide variety of species, both vertebrate and invertebrate.20 His observation that the cerebellum is much less subject to interspecific variation than the cerebrum was well founded, and his specula- tions concerning the possible functions of these two regions of the brain were at least consistent with his anatomical findings. On occasion Willis also sought additional confirmation with post-mortem data on his own patients.21 But it is obvious that for the nervous system (as well as for other organs and systems like the liver, spleen, or endocrine system) the kind of functional information which the anatomical method could yield was of a very general nature. Even Willis recognized his speculations as such; he knew that his physiology was consistent with, but not demonstrated by, his dissections. As he modestly commented, after a lengthy exposition of the functions of the corpora quadrigemina,22 "But however the business [of their functions] is, because nothing can be certainly affirmed, or demonstrated, if this our Opinion please not others, at least it may be pardoned" (AB 100). There are two further points of significance for our purposes in Willis' neuro- anatomical work. The first concerns the problem of neurological localization, while the second relates to the fact (mentioned above) that Willis used the anatomical method to justify his theory of the rational soul. For the anatomical method to be effective in elucidating the functions of the nervous system, these functions must be localized in the different regions of that system. If the brain and spinal cord function as a syncytium, or if some ontologically distinct mind or soul can play on random parts of the brain to effect its will, then the method is use- less. Total mass of the nervous system might still be retained as some basis of com- parison, but the kind of detailed anatomico-physiologic correlations which Willis attempted would not make sense. He required some theory linking neurological structure and function to account for facts such as man's proportionately larger 20The quotation is from the dedication (to Gilbert Sheldon) of the AB. Willis' invertebrate work is reported principally in the SB, pp. 7-21. 21 E.g., AB, p. 132. 22 These two pairs of bodies were called the nates and testes, a familiarity about which later anatomists complained.</page><page sequence="10">ANATOMICAL METHOD AND BRAIN FUNCTION 453 cerebral hemispheres when compared to quadrupeds or birds. In short Willis needed a theory of neurological localization. We have already seen what particular functions he assigned to the cerebrum and cerebellum. To these can be added the corpus striatum, where he placed sensory perception and voluntary motion, the corpus callosum (imagination), and the "mid brain" (instinctive behavior).23 For Willis, then, structure implies function. But what of the reverse: does function imply structure? Are there functions which operate in the absence of structure? Superficially the answer for various sixteenth- and seventeenth-century thinkers seems simple enough. For Daniel Sennert, Jean-Pierre de Crousaz, and other ad- herents of the belief that animals as well as men possess immaterial souls, the answer is yes.24 The Cartesian response would be no for animals, but yes in the case of man. Hobbes and other materialists would say no.26 But these answers are more precise than the state of the contemporary debate justifies. Descartes, for example, localized the soul in the pineal gland, and it could be asked if the soul "needs" that organ in order to function. The question can be formulated in a slightly different way: does the rational (immaterial) soul have physiological functions? For both Descartes and Willis it does. The functions which Willis localized with the aid of the anatomical method are only those of the sensitive soul. He does not apply the method for those uniquely human faculties of the rational soul. His motivation may have been ultimately theological or metaphysical, but his justification was anatomical, for the structural differences between rational men and irrational animals were not (he believed) adequate to ex- plain the observed functional differences between rational men and irrational animals. As he remarked in The Soul of Brutes: As we have shewn, by comparing the Corporeal Soul of the Brute, with the Rational of Man, what vast difference there is between them, perhaps it might be to the purpose, to compare the Brains of either, and to observe their differences. But this Anatomy being elsewhere made [in the Cerebri anatome], we have noted little or no difference, in the Head of either, as to the Figures and Exterior Conformations of the Parts, the Bulk only excepted; that from hence we concluded, the Soul Common to Man with the Brutes, to be only Corporeal, and immediately to use these Organs. (SB 44.) Thus for Willis the structure of the human brain was not sufficiently distinct from that of a dog or a sheep to bear the weight of the actual mental differences between man and brute. In particular there are no unique structures in the human brain in which the peculiar human capacities of language, reason, and moral judgment could be located. The structural differences are only quantitative, and those mostly of magnitude rather than form. 23 Willis' work on neurological localization is discussed by Meyer and Hierons, "On Thomas Willis's Concepts of Neurophysiology," loc. cit. The classic monograph of Max Neuburger is still valuable: Die historische Entwicklung der experimentellen Gehirn- und Riickenmarks- physiologie vor Flourens (Stuttgart:F. Enke, 1897), esp. pp. xxi, xxiii, and xx f. It should be noted that in the seventeenth century the term corpus callosum referred to all portions of the white matter of the brain. See Edwin Clarke and C. D. O'Malley, The Human Brain and Spinal Cord (Berkeley:University of California Press, 1968), p. 473. 24 In addition to the works cited in n. 15, the famous articles "Rorarius" and "Sennert" in Pierre Bayle, Dictionnaire historique et critique (Rotterdam, 1697), contain useful material on the history of the animal soul. 26 Hobbes' psychology is lucidly discussed by Richard Peters, Hobbes (2nd ed., Harmonds- worth:Penguin Books, 1967), esp. Ch. 3.</page><page sequence="11">454 WILLIAM F. BYNUM Willis was not the first to use comparative anatomy to "prove" the existence of an immaterial principle in man. A century earlier Vesalius had made the same observa- tions and had used the limitations of the anatomical method as the basis of conclu- sions not unlike those of Willis: "The brains of quadrupeds . . . closely resemble those of men in all their parts. Should we on that account ascribe to them every power of reason, and even a rational soul ?"26 The question was rhetorical; the requisite answer was negative. Vesalius however then went on to emphasize absolute brain size as an adequate guide to the intelligence of the species (man included), leaving ambiguously solved the problem Willis was later to raise. The immediate post-Vesalian literature on the comparative anatomy of the brain was channelled in another direction, namely, the problem of the rete mirabile and the related question whether Galen had described the anatomy of the ape or that of man.27 Thus it is in the context of the Cartesian metaphysical dualism rather than the earlier Vesalian "anatomic" dualism that Willis' own formulations of the problem must be viewed. Willis made little use either of earlier neuroanatomical studies or of prior attempts to localize neurological functions.28 Willis' division of the soul into the rational and the sensitive components was one way of solving the sometimes perplexing issues raised by the remarkable anatomical similarities between men and the other mammals, especially the members of the group which Edward Tyson was soon to call Quadrumana-the tailed and tailless apes and monkeys. Willis generally referred to domestic animals (sheep, dogs, pigs, cats) in his neuroanatomical works, and a quarter of the way through the Cerebri anatome he remarked that he had never had the opportunity of examining the brain of a monkey (AB 70). However, some sixty pages later he recorded the results of the dissection of a monkey-the occasion having presented itself "Whilst we were writing these [pages]" (AB 132). Of course, Willis found in the monkey's brain an even closer approach to the structure of the human brain than obtained in domestic quadrupeds. In particular, the monkey's brain was "more capacious in the proportion to the bulk of his Body," and in several respects (especially in the region of the corpora quadrigemina) it "came nearer the figure and magnitude of those parts in a man" (AB 132-133). He also noted that a branch of what he called the "intercostal nerve" (the chain of sym- pathetic ganglia), thought by Willis to be present in man but absent in quadrupeds, was also present in his "anatomized monkey." We shall examine the significance of this finding below. Thus the results of the simian dissection further substantiated Willis' division, for he now had an even nearer approximation to human brain structure in a creature also lacking the "rational functions." The anatomical method sufficed to explain the varying functions of the sensitive soul in both men and brutes, the rational faculties 26 Andreas Vesalius, On the Human Brain, trans.

BYNUM being attributed (in the absence of unique human brain structures) to an immaterial principle. But making this absolute distinction proved easier than consistently adhering to it. The distinction which seems clear enough in portions of Willis' work blurs and even disappears in other parts. For example, Willis rejected the Cartesian localization of the soul in the pineal gland: "because Animals, which seem to be almost quite destitute of Imagination, Memory, and other superior Powers of the Soul, have this glandula or kernel large and fair enough" (AB 87). Having rejected the Cartesian localization of the rational soul on anatomical grounds, Willis himself promptly localizes it to the corpus callosum, seat of imagination or "phantasie." This he did because "the Rational Soul ... depends very much, as to its operation, on the Phantasie, without the help of which, it can know or understand nothing" (SB 41). Elsewhere he referred to the corpus callosum as "inhabiting that region of the Brain where the principle faculties of the knowing or understanding soul reside" (SB 153). The theoretical sharpness of Willis' distinctions becomes further blurred if they are carefully scrutinized. The rational soul is responsible for the intellectual faculties of man. But clearly all men do not possess these faculties to an equal degree. Although men vary in intelligence and judgment, the rational soul (being simultaneously the theological soul) is given to all men equally.29 Hence Willis concluded that the rational soul is actually dependent on the sensitive for its proper operation: ... Wherefore, that the Mind of one Man understands more, and reasoneth better, than that of another, it does not thence follow, that Rational Souls are inequal, but every disparity, concerning the Intellect, proceeds immediately from the Phantasie [i.e., imagination], but mediately and principally from the Brain, being variously disposed. (SB 41.) This dependence of the rational on the sensitive soul is also seen in pathological states. A condition Willis called "stupidity or foolishness" "most chiefly belongs to the Rational Soul, and signifies a defect of the Intellect and Judgment."30 Nevertheless, Willis included it among his list of diseases of the sensitive soul, since he attributed the lack of judgment and intellect to proceed from a faulty imagination and memory, that is, from physical defects of the brain (SB 209 if.). Another instance in which Willis' theoretically precise model of the two-souled man breaks down in practice can be pieced together from his scattered comments on the relationship between the heart and the brain. Willis wrote in the aftermath of Harvey's Aristotelian emphasis on the primacy of the heart.3' He was well acquainted with Harvey's writings (and probably with Harvey himself),32 but for Willis the brain, as the seat of the rational and sensitive souls, remained the chief organ of the body. 29 SB 41. Cf. Descartes' comments in his Discourse on Method, in Works, pp. 81-82: "the diversity of our opinions does not proceed from some men being more rational than others, but solely from the fact that our thoughts pass through diverse channels and the same objects are not considered by all.... For as to sense or reason, inasmuch as it is the only thing that constitutes us men and distinguishes us from the brutes, I would fain believe that it is found complete in each individual." 30 For a modern commentary on Willis' categorization of this condition, see the paper of Cranefield, "A Seventeenth Century View." 31 For Harvey's Aristotelianism, see Walter Pagel, William Harvey's Biological Ideas (Basel/ New York: S. Karger, 1966), pp. 28-47, 83-86. 32 Willis and Harvey were both in Oxford during the Civil War and undoubtedly knew each other. See Geoffrey Keynes, The Life of William Harvey (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961), p. 296.</page><page sequence="14">ANATOMICAL METHOD AND BRAIN FUNCTION 457 Willis, however, did not banish the heart from his "anatomical court." Instead he claimed to have discovered the reason why the human heart seems to play so rich a part in the emotional life of human beings. One of the chief classical arguments for locating various mental functions in tthe heart was the obvious influence which strong emotions-rage, fear, lust, grief-exert on the heart. Willis did not denigrate the importance of this kind of response, felt more keenly in the thorax than in the head. Rather he believed he could provide the anatomical explanation: Man has a two-part innervation of his heart, in contrast to the sparser innervation of the brute heart. Whereas animals receive almost all their cardiac innervation from the vagus nerve, man in addition has fibers derived from the thoracic portion of the "intercostal nerve" (sympathetic chain of ganglia). This richer nerve supply makes the connections between heart and brain more intimate in men than in animals, and "works of Pru- dence and Vertue depend very much on this mutual commerce" (AB 132). Indeed, not merely morality, perhaps even the general intellectual capacities of men depend on this nerve, for Willis reported the dissection of a "Fool" in whose brain ... we could find no defect or fault ... unless that its substance or bulk was very small. But the chief note of difference which we observed between the parts of this man and of a man of judgment, was this, That the aforesaid infolding of the intercostal Nerve, which we call the Internuncius of the Brain and Heart, proper to man, was very small in this Fool, and beset with a weaker guard of Nerves. (AB 132.) Thus Willis intimated that the cardiac branch of the intercostal nerve, being "proper to man" and being one of the few nervous structures peculiar to man, has functions which are connected with uniquely human capacities. However, on his own terms, this analysis extends only to his quadrupeds; the monkey which he dissected also possessed this branch of the intercostal nerve-a fact which Willis found more striking than the anthropomorphic features of the simian brain. Perhaps, Willis suggested, this nerve is partly "the reason, why this Animal is so crafty and mimical above other Beasts, and can so aptly shew and imitate, not only the gestures, but the passions and some manners of a man" (AB 133). It is a remarkable nerve, indeed, the absence of which can eclipse a man's rational soul, and the possession of which can make a brute '"crafty above other Beasts." We are finally left, then, with a notion of the rational soul which by the end of Willis' analyses retains little of its initial pristine clarity. The rational soul keeps its theological characteristics, but it is at the same time dependent on the sensitive soul for its proper operation, subject through this dependence to diseases which are potentially curable by physical methods, localized in its seat to a particular portion of the human brain, and possibly requiring for its functioning a peripheral nerve which monkeys in fact possess. What lay behind the multiple dilutions of Willis' theories? Several explanations might be proferred: (1) It is possible that Willis intended these qualifications to be so obvious that his readers would see that his taxonomy of souls was no more than a meaningless acquiescence to the theologians. This kind of argument has been leveled at Descartes,33 but regardless of its applicability to the Frenchman, there is little evidence to link it to Willis. His high church religiosity was genuine, maintained as it was during the 33 See, e.g., Aram Vartanian, Diderot and Descartes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1953).</page><page sequence="15">458 WILLIAM F. BYNUM Protectorate at some danger to both person and position.34 Willis was keenly aware of the theological implications of his researches on the "functions of the soul" and obviously reluctant to risk incurring theological odium.35 But that does not mean that he felt pressured into making statements which he did not really believe. We must not read modern cynicism back into earlier, more devout periods.6 (2) More relevant, the inconsistencies in Willis' work may be partly attributed to his own penchant for speculation without adequate substantiation and without the methods of proper verification. This characteristic of Willis' work was recognized as a weakness by his contemporaries, especially the Danish scientist and theologian Nicolaus Steno, whose own Discours sur 1'anatomie du cerveau was delivered in 1665, only one year after the publication of Willis' Cerebri anatome.37 Steno parti- cularly criticized Willis' remarks on localization: "We know so little of the true structure of the Corpus Callosum [Steno remarked in reference to Willis] that a Man of a tolerable Genius may say about it, whatever he pleases."38 Steno's strictures were to a certain extent justified, although as we have seen, Willis' statements on neurologic localization were not so unbridledly arbitrary as has sometimes been intimated. He attempted to keep them consistent with the various details of com- parative neuroanatomy which he had uncovered; and he also maintained an un- dogmatic attitude toward his own speculations. (3) Willis' proclivities toward theorizing help to explain why he was generally wrong about the functions he assigned to different portions of the nervous system. But it is only partly satisfying as a source of the tensions generated by his inability consistently to apply in practice his theoretical analysis of the etiology of psycho- logical distinctions between men and brutes. These tensions also derive from a proposition underlying the practice of both natural theology and the anatomical method: that organic structure has function. To be more precise, we may say that the kind of structure/function analysis which Willis used could not accommodate (in the absence of unique neurologic structures) the qualitative physiological differences which he postulated to exist between men and animals. There was nothing inherently contradictory about his suggestion that for man alone structureless physiological functions exist; indeed, we have seen that he relied for this proposal on the apparent inadequacy of the anatomical method to account for the "rational faculties" of man. But having made a qualitative distinction he immediately diluted it by pushing his anatomical method beyond the limits which were consistent with his own terms of analysis. He uses his method whenever he can to show that man (structurally and functionally) is more complicated, more finely wrought, than any brute. When he 34 Isler, Willis, pp. 11-13 and Dewhurst, Willis. 35 See, e.g., the dedicatory epistle (to Gilbert Sheldon) of the Soul of Brutes. 36Walter Pagel has repeatedly cautioned against the "modernization" of seventeenth- century thinkers, most recently in "Van Helmont's Concept of Disease: To Be or Not To Be," Bull.

But even Willis viewed this nerve as merely quantitatively complicating the fabric of the human body: Whilst I consider this difference [between the innervation of human and animal hearts], it comes into my mind, that Brutes are like Machines framed with a more simple furniture and with less workmanship, and therefore furnished with a motion of one kind only, or determined for the doing still the same thing. But in Man divers series of motions, and as it were complications of wheels within wheels, appear. (AB 132.) Is man (in physiologic terms) a more complicated machine, or a being of an entirely different order from the "brute creation"? It is not necessarily an either/or situation, but if one can find enough "wheels within wheels" in the human frame, one runs the risk of weakening a theory which, like Willis', relies on neurological similarities between man and those animals whose brains most closely resemble his. It should be noted that the terms of Willis' analysis do not bear on the question of vitalism, which concerns the differentiation of living from nonliving matter and theoretically has nothing to do with the relationship between man and animals. Neither do Willis' theories necessitate an inconsistent solution to the issues raised by Cartesian dualism. Indeed, with a bit more care Willis might have consistently formu- lated his two-soul argument. But the anatomical method presupposes a continuity of the structure/function relationship as an organ or system is traced through a series of analogously constructed animals. If the kind of physiological disjunction which Willis postulated between man and brute is to be maintained, he should not look for nerves to mediate morality. The dilemma in Willis' work was created by his belief-shared by virtually all scientists of his day and for almost two centuries afterward-that the theological soul has physiologic functions. The dilemma was intensified by a number of facts which few naturalists or physiologists disputed: that animals partake in some degree of most if not all of the mental phenomena of human beings; that animals whose brains are more anthropoid exhibit subtler patterns of behavior; that man simultaneously demon- strates the most "noble" nervous system and the zenith of mental perfection; and that human beings whose brains are deformed or damaged through disease or accident generally suffer a subsequent diminution of their "mental powers." The resolution of the dilemma was ultimately effected (in the nineteenth century) not by the fusion of mind and body, but by the separation of mind from soul. It was brought about by the gradual acceptance of the fact that the human nervous system is sufficiently different from the nervous system of animals to bear the weight of the mental gaps which distinguish them, although the actual width of the gap continued to be a matter of dispute. But Willis and his contemporaries were too impressed by the neuroanatomical similarities between men and animals. They were at the same time committed to a view of man which accentuated his anatomical preeminence, and it was an accepted task of the natural theologian to point out the evidences of this preeminence. It is not surprising to find in the natural theology of the period in- consistencies identical to those we observed in Willis: the desire to discover anatomical representation of man's superior mentality when the terms of analysis theoretically precluded it.</page><page sequence="17">460 WILLIAM F. BYNUM III. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NATURAL THEOLOGY Science and theology, both natural and revealed, were perhaps never more intimate, or more genuinely synergistic, than in the England of Willis' century. Both divines and scientists (the callings frequently coalescing in the same person) exulted in the libera- tion of the New Science and the true, Protestant theology. In the century of Bacon, Harvey, Boyle, Hooke, Wilkins, More, Locke, Glisson, Barrow, and Newton, few doubted that the study of God's word and of his works were but two paths to the same end.39 England's foremost naturalist in that period of her intellectual greatness40 was also her finest natural theologian. John Ray's volumes on botany, zoology, and geology represent the most important individual effort to survey the three kingdoms of nature between Gesner in the sixteenth century and Linnaeus in the eighteenth.4' Albrecht von Haller said of Ray that he was the "greatest botanist in the memory of man" ; Cuvier said of his books on animals that "they are the basis of all modern zoology."42 It is characteristic both of the era and the country in which Ray lived that the author of the Historia plantarum (three volumes, 1686-1704) also wrote A Persuasive to a Holy Life (1700). These two aspects of the man are synthesized in his classic of natural theology, The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation (1691). Like Willis, Ray accepted the validity of the anatomical method; and for both men the ultimate guarantee of the method lay in the designfulness of the universe. Organic form signifies organic function because there is nothing superfluous in God's creation. So deeply was Ray committed to an essential rationality behind Creation that he questioned whether fossils could be only "sports of nature." He recognized that if fossils were the remains of organisms once alive, the accepted history of the earth would have to be rewritten, for marine shells were being found far inland and in deep strata on mountain tops. Yet, as he wrote, That Nature should form real Shells, without any Design of covering an Animal, is indeed so contrary to that innate Prolepsis we have of the Prudence of Nature (that is, the Author of Nature) that without doing some Violence to our Faculties, we can hardly prevail with ourselves to believe it; and gives great Countenance to the Atheists Assertion, that Things were made or did exist by Chance, without Counsel or Direction to any end.43 Function can thus be inferred from structure even in the fossilized remains of species not observable in their living state.44 39In addition to Fruchtbaum, "Natural Theology," and Westfall, Science and Religion, see R. Hooykaas, Religion and the Rise of Modern Science (Edinburgh:Scottish Academic Press, 1972). 40The century is so characterized by Peter Laslett in the introduction to his edition of John Locke, Two Treatises on Government (New York: Mentor Books, 1965), p. 29. 41 Charles Raven, John Ray, Naturalist (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1942). ,1 Both comments are quoted in the article on Ray in the Dictionary of National Biography (DNB); Haller's is from his Bibliotheca botanica, Cuvier's from the notice of Ray in the Bio- graphie universelle, reprinted in Edwin Lankester, ed., Memorials of Ray (London:The Ray Society, 1846), pp. 95-108.

During his two decades at Cambridge Ray came under the influence of Henry More, Ralph Cudworth, John Tillotson, and the other philosophic theologians known as the Cambridge Platonists.46 Ray imbibed from them a dissatisfaction with the Cartesian analysis in terms of matter and motion; he believed that the French- man's animal-machine hypothesis failed to account for the phenomena of life. All living things partake of an immaterial essence emanating from the Creator. As Ray summarized it, I am difficult to believe, that the Bodies of Animals can be formed by Matter divided and moved by what Laws you will or can imagine, without the immediate Presidency, Direction and Regulation of some Intelligent Being.... I should rather think Animals to be endued with a lower Degree of Reason, than that they are mere Machines.47 Ray thus rejected the notion held by Willis, Gassendi, and Descartes that the brutal soul is material, though he retained the classification of souls into sensitive and rational.48 He claimed however that both kinds are immaterial. Ray was conversant with Willis' work; he used his anatomy without subscribing to the theory underlying it.49 In The Wisdom of God, however, Ray avoided for the most part any detailed analysis of comparative brain structure. The biological portions of that work are concerned principally with those organs and systems where the perfect adaptation of structure and function is easily demonstrated. The eye gets fourteen pages, the heart five, the hand four, man's upright posture four.50 The force of Ray's argument depends on the fact that structure-and function are related, that no part is superfluous, and that each structure has its necessary function: "For had the Body been made by chance it must in all likelyhood have had many of these superfluous and unnecessary Parts."'51 And just as the perfect adaptation of structure and function applies equally to man and brute, so does the possession of analogous organs argue for the continuity of functional categories: "[Animals] having the same Members and Organs of Sense as we have, it is very probable they have the digm for a postulated function shows whether the structure would have been physically capable of fulfilling that function. It cannot however establish that in fact it did fulfil that function." See also M. J. S. Rudwick, The Meaning of Fossils (London: MacDonald, 1972), esp.

BYNUM same Sensations and Perceptions with us."52 Animals see, hear, experience pleasure and pain, and even reason at a primitive level, and they possess these mental attributes in proportion as their brains structurally approach man's. In an earlier paper Ray had even used this general observation to argue the possible validity of the stories recorded in the ancient literature about the extraordinary feats of the Cetaceans. Ray and Francis Willughby dissected a porpoise which had washed ashore at Chester in 1669. So impressed was Ray with the anthropoid features of the porpoise's brain that he remarked in his letter to the Royal Society describing the dissection: This largeness of the [porpoise's] brain, and correspondence of it to that of man, argue this Creature to be of more than ordinary wit, and capacity, and make to seem less fabulous and improbable those Ancient stories, related by Herodotus concerning Arion; By Pliny the Elder concerning a Dolphin enamoured of a Boy, whom he was wont to carry cross a bay of the Sea, from Baiae to Puteoli, to school, etc.53 In the first edition of the Wisdom of God, however, Ray made no specific comparisons of human and animal brains. He commented that "the Brain in Man is far larger in proportion to the Bulk of his Body, than in any other Animal,"54 but he did not elaborate the differences between a rational and a sensitive soul beyond the observa- tion that the immateriality of a sensitive soul did not necessitate its being immortal. What God has created he can annihilate if he so pleases.5 The Wisdom of God went through four editions during Ray's lifetime, and by the 1704 edition the work had doubled in size. One of the sections which Ray added to the third edition of 1701 was concerned with the apparent disjunction of the comparative structure/function analysis characteristic of the anatomical method. Both data and conclusions are similar to Willis', but Ray derived his material from Edward Tyson, the comparative anatomist whose monograph on the anatomy of the chimpanzee was published in 1699.56 Tyson's work represented the first detailed study of the anatomy of a tailless (anthropoid) ape ever carried out. His animal, which he called an Orang- Outang, or pigmy, is known to us as the chimpanzee. Tyson formulated his argument in a way which significantly furthered the notion of a structural gradation extending from man throughout the animal kingdom.57 He pointed out that anatomically the pigmy should be placed halfway between man and the tailed monkeys; in some anatomical structures it approached the figure of man, while in others it was more nearly like the tailed monkeys. For example, its kidneys were round, like the monkey's; its teeth were shaped like a man's. In Tyson's final tally, in forty-eight ways the "Pygmie more resembled a Man, than Apes and Monkeys do"; in thirty-four, it "differ'd from a Man, and resembled more the Apes and Monkey-kind."58 52 Ibid., p. 39.

These organs were those involved in the formation of words (the larynx, pharynx, and tongue) and of thoughts (the brain). For the former Tyson returned to an observation of Claude Perrault and the other Parisian anatomists whose Memoires pour servir a l'histoire naturelle des animaux, first published in 1671, laid (according to F. J. Cole) "the foundation of our modern knowledge of comparative anatomy."59 In the Memoires the Parisian group reported the results of dissections of four tailed monkeys. They noted that the ... Muscles of the Os Hyoides, Tongue, Larynx and Pharynx, which do most serve to articulate a word, were wholly like to those of Man, and a great deal more than those of the Hand; which nevertheless the Ape, which speaks not, uses almost with as much perfection as Man: which Demonstrates that speech is an Action more peculiar to Man, and which more distinguishes him from the Brutes than the Hand; and which Anaxa- goras, Aristotle and Galen have thought to be the Organ which Nature has given to Man as to the wisest of all Animals, for want perhaps of making this Reflection. For the Ape is found provided by Nature of all these Marvellous Organs of speech with so much exactness, that the very three small Muscles which do take their rise from the Apophysis Styloides, are not wanting, altho this Apophysis be extreamly small. This parti- cularitie do's likewise shew that there is no reason to think that Agents do performe such and such Actions, because they are found with Organs proper thereunto: For according to these Philosophers Apes should speake, seeing that they have the Instruments nec- essary for speech.60 Tyson found a similar situation in the pharynx and larynx of his chimpanzee-a perfect replication of the organs of speech in a mute creature. Even more impressive was the approximation of the simian brain structure to that of man. Not only were all the human brain structures mirrored in this ape; even the proportion of brain to body weight reached the ratio seen in man. Thus the conclusion the Parisians drew for the vocal organs Tyson extended to include the brain: Since therefore in all respects the Brain of our Pygmie does so exactly resemble a Man's, I might here make the same Reflection the Parisians did upon the Organs of Speech, That there is no reason to think, that Agents do perform such and such Actions, because they are found with Organs proper thereunto: for then our Pygmie might be really a Man.... Those Nobler Faculties in the Mind of Man, must certainly have a higher Principle; and Matter organized could never produce them; for why else, where the Organ is the same, should not the Actions be the same too? and if all depended on the Organ, not only our Pygmie, but other Brutes likewise, would be too near akin to us.61 Tyson's argument on the brain is identical to Willis': the use of an apparent dis- junction of the comparative structure/function relationship to erect an absolute barrier between man and brute. Ray extracted this portion of Tyson's work for his volume on natural theology. To Ray this breakdown of the anatomical method was proof that "Things did not make Uses; ... Uses made Things."62 Function is not the accidental consequence of a prior-existing structure; rather structure was designed to accommodate function. 6 F. J.

BYNUM Tyson's examples demonstrate the former proposition that things did not make uses, since apes possess the apparent neurologic and laryngeal apparatus with which to think and speak. For the latter proposition ("Uses made Things") Ray supplied his own illustration from botany: only plants with "weak and infirm Stalks" possess tendrils. No plant that "hath a firm and strong stem, and that is able to mount up and stand alone without assistance" has them. Had tendrils been scattered carelessly among plants "without design," some plants with no use for them would undoubtedly possess them. Function, then, is more basic than structure. We can see in Ray's two related propositions the kind of subtle tension which occasionally surfaced in Willis' work. The case of the tendrils illustrates the point which Ray and all other natural theologians stress: that functionless organs or "contrivances" do not exist. But for Tyson's work on the chimp brain to be completely persuasive Ray would need to abandon his contention that man's brain proportionately is "far larger" than that of any other animal.63 And the example of the vocal organs leads to further problems, for it might be asked why the chimp has such finely wrought structures if they are of no use to that species. Ray's answer is that God appears to have planned it so, to "confute this fond Conceit of Atheists" that function is merely the consequence of structure.64 But such an answer can satisfy only at the expense of Ray's argument for a perfectly designed universe where structure always meets immediate functional requirements. If trees had useless tendrils Ray could have employed the same kind of argument to "prove" the primacy of function. He cannot consistently have it both ways. The "function" he invoked for the chimp's vocal organs cannot be allowed, since it assumes the existence of the object he was attempt- ing to demonstrate. Although Ray eventually incorporated Willis' paradigm, he avoided Willis' own formulation, probably because he disagreed with the physician's notion of the corporeal soul. In Tyson's work (as in Ray's) the exact nature of the difference between the sensitive and rational soul is left ambiguous. But other natural theologians of the period more explicitly borrowed from Willis. John Edwards, for example, was a Calvinistic divine who crossed pens with men of various persuasions, including John Locke, William Whiston, the Socinians, and the Papists.5 His natural theology, published in 1696 as A Demonstration of the Existence and Providence of God, was in the standard two parts. In the first he surveyed the heavens, earth, and the kingdoms of nature; in the second he confined himself to the excellencies of the human body. He excluded the human mind, for "I undertake the Proof of a Deity from the Visible and Corporeal part of Man only."66 Edwards' position on the animal soul question is difficult to determine; he denied animals reason, and though he was no Cartesian, the esteem he accorded Willis ("That Eminent Physician of our Age"67) suggests that he did not find Willis' notion of a corporeal soul completely unattractive. Edwards stuck closely to this announced program of considering the "corporeal part of Man only"; the second part of his book essentially essays the ways in which 63 Cf. above. In the 3rd ed. of the Wisdom the statement appears on p. 229. 64 Ray, Wisdom of God (1701), p. 376. 65 There is a short biographical sketch in the DNB. 66 John Edwards, A Demonstration of the Existence and Providence of God, from the Contemplation of the Visible Structure of the Greater and the Lesser World (London, 1696), Pt.

It is a familiar catalogue of attributes: upright posture, a rounded skull with the largest proportionate brain, refined and individually distinct facial features (to prevent "accidental" incest and adultery), thoracic position of the breasts, unique hands and fingers. Edwards' task was made easier by the fact that he wrote three years before Tyson brought the anthropoid features of the chimpanzee into more general currency. The ape simply does not con- cern Edwards. Of the vocal organs, for example, he wrote, There are sundry other things in Man's Structure which are not found in Brutes, as the particular Conformation of the inward parts of the Mouth, and other adjacent Organs, whence Speech is the sole Prerogative of Men, excepting a few apish Birds which have some resemblance to Man in some of those parts.68 This passage may reflect careless science, but it more clearly represents the natural theological ideal than Ray's analogous remarks, since Edwards here assumes that structure is a sufficient guide to function. Of the brain itself Edwards had relatively little to say. He disagreed with Vesalius, who had "pronounced the Fabrick of Man's Brain and that of other Animals to be alike," because anatomists (unnamed) of his own day had found "some (though no great) difference between them." Man's brain is "a most Divine Treasure," "so choice a Viscus," "a very Noble Part," "of special and singular Use," "the Seat of the Soul, and the Source ofLife," and "the Spring and Fountain of all Sense and Motion."69 These were common epithets, culled from a variety of authors. From Willis however he derived almost all he said about the peripheral nerves. The peculiar innervation of the human heart is mentioned, but he placed even greater emphasis on Willis' scattered comments on other nerves going to the face, tear sac, and diaphragm. This network of nerves is "the Reas-on why Laughter is proper to Man only," why ... as soon as Grief invades the Breast, the Face corresponds and is troubled.... There is no Creature, properly speaking, weeps but Man, for this comes from that inward Sense and Perception which are not in irrational Animals. This must be attributed to the particular Make of their Organs: And this particular Make must be ascribed to the Will and Wisdom of the Creator, who knew this was most suitable to Humane Nature.70 When Edwards wrote that these nerves are "the Reason why. . ." or that the vocal organs are "whence . . . ," he undoubtedly referred only to the efficient causes. But in that sense natural theologians were like scientists, pushing the analysis of efficient causation as far as they could, happiest when function could be referred to some palpable, material structure. Edwards overstated the case for man's physical superior- ity, however, thereby making explanation in terms of "the Corporeal part of Man only" more inclusive and satisfying on its own merits. Ray's friend and editor William Derham provides another instance of the manner in which a natural theologian dealt with the problem of the relationship between structure and function in the nervous system. His Physico-Theology (1713) was based on his Boyle lectures of 1711 and 1712. Derham published a second volume of natural theology-the Astro-Theology-in 1715. Both works achieved multiple editions and translations during the next half-century.7' 68Ibid., p. 5. 69 Ibid., pp. 10-13, passim. 70 Ibid., pp. 56-57. 71 A. D. Atkinson, "William Derham, F.R.S.

BYNUM Derham relied heavily on Ray for his material and arrangement; but his approach to the nervous system is more reminiscent of Edwards. Though Derham occasionally mentioned Tyson's Orang-Outang, he eschewed the anatomist's remarks on the ape's brain and vocal organs. Like Edwards he chose to emphasize the physical separation of man and animal. He capitalized on Willis' dissections of the intercostal nerve, devoting an entire chapter to "the difference between Man and Quadrupeds in the NERVOUS kind."72 Willis' work on the peculiar innervation of the human heart demonstrated that man was intended to be a rational creature, just as quadrupeds were meant to be irrational.73 Man's essential rational nature was further manifested for Derham by Willis' theories of neurological localization: quadrupeds have heads situated so that their cerebellums are higher than their cerebrums. Hence, in irrational animals the involuntary functions of the cerebellum are most important. Man's up- right posture, however, places his cerebrum above his cerebellum. Thus in man the higher faculties dominate the lower.74 In the natural theologies of Ray, Edwards, and Derham are mirrored aspects of the problems raised by the scientific work of Willis and Tyson. The eagerness with which both natural theologian and anatomist seized upon what slight comparative neurologic variations they could find belies the confidence with which they used brain similarities to posit structureless function. It would have been convenient for the argument from design and the anatomical method had the pineal gland been unique to man. IV. CONCLUSION The brain and the larynx: at these two points, so it seemed, the correlation of structure and function did not hold. We have examined the uses made by anatomists and natural theologians of the two apparent anomalies. The case of the brain pointed toward an immaterial principle unique to man, so that his apelike brain housed a soul capable of functions qualitatively different from those attained by brutes. The larynx on the other hand demonstrated the priority of function and proved that function is not just the necessary consequence of structure. Man's mind (or soul) was an example of structureless function, the ape's larynx one of functionless structure. Neither example could be satisfactorily accommodated by the argument from design or the anatomical method. Both the argument and the method required a continuity and a consistency of the structure/function relationship. On one level both natural theolo- gians and anatomists expected to find structural manifestations (larger brain, upright posture, etc.) of man's special place in creation. At another level both groups wanted to disrupt the continuity of structure and function by bringing a theological concept into their anatomical discussions. We have examined the ways in which they attempted to play one approach off against the other. It is of course no accident that the anomalies of the brain and the larynx bore directly on man and his relationship to the rest of creation. Nor is it mere coincidence that both examples were explicitly employed to get beyond anatomy and physiology and to place man within a theological context. Not until the theological issue of the 72 William Derham, Physico-Theology: or, a Demonstration of the Being and A ttributes of God, from his Works of Creation (London: W. Innys, 1713), Bk.

If the human mind is equated to the human soul, one cannot consistently attempt the kind of anatomical and psychological comparisons which Willis on occasion allowed. This equation of mind and soul was built into the structure of Cartesian dualism, and neither the slight modifications of Willis nor the more substantial changes of Ray circumvented the dilemma entirely. Indeed, the precise form of dilemma which we have found in Willis, Ray, and Tyson may be seen recurring throughout the eighteenth century: in Buffon, for example, who specifically fell back on Tyson's Orang-Outang to justify his own notions of animal machines and thinking souls, but who at the same time invoked the usual examples of disease, insanity, sleep, infancy, and senility to stress that the soul too has a natural history which closely parallels that of the body.75 It can be seen in David Hartley, who developed a physical model of the mind which embraced man and brute in a single system, only to qualify it with a scholium making it against the rules to argue the materiality of the human soul from his theories.76 It can be seen in Cuvier, who pro- tested that the nature of the psychological characteristics separating man from animal did not involve questiones anatomiques, but who vigorously pushed the search for some measurement whereby anatomy and intelligence could be correlated.77 Buffon may have been consciously two-faced; he was accused by his contemporaries of talking Soul to the Sorbonne and Matter to the philosophes.78 But the same thing cannot be said of Hartley or Cuvier; nor does it apply to J. C. Prichard, John Barclay, Pierre Flourens, and others in whose work similar tensions can be found. Despite Cuvier's somewhat rhetorical notice of the underlying neurological similar- ities of all mammals,79 naturalists of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were less impressed with the anthropomorphic features of the ape than were Tyson, Buffon, Linnaeus, and the earlier generations of naturalists. Additional comparative anatomical studies by J. F. Blumenbach, Petrus Camper, S. T. Sommering, J. W. and Karl Wenzel, Cuvier, J. F. Meckel, and others uncovered numerous small differences between human and simian anatomy. The brain continued to pose problems, as no major unique human cerebral structures were discovered, but there was increasing significance placed on the greater size and complexity of man's cerebral hemispheres.80 It was this context which gave the phrenological doctrines of F. J. Gall an inherent plausibility. Gall's work may be taken as the culmination of the anatomical method as it could be applied to the nervous system. In common with Willis, Gall attempted to correlate neurologic structure and psychological functions. His writings possess the 75 See, e.g., the chapter "Nomenclature des singes" in Buffon, Oeuvres completes, ed. J.-L. de Lanessan (Paris, 1884), Vol. X, pp. 100-102. 7 David Hartley, Observations on Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his Expectations (London, 1749). The scholium is in Vol. I, p. 33. It is significant that throughout the book Hartley uses the world mind to refer to his model. The word soul occurs only in the context of the scholium, though it is obvious that at one level at least Hartley equates the two concepts. 77 Georges Cuvier, Le!ons d'anatomie com- paree (Paris, 1805), Vol. II, pp. 118 ff. 78 Vartanian, Diderot and Descartes, p. 305. 79 "Pourquoi, avec tant de ressemblance dans la structure du systeme nerveux, dans le mode de son action, dans le nombre et la structure des principaux organes exterieurs, y a-t-il une difference si 6norme quant au resultat total entre l'homme et l'animal le plus parfait?"

BYNUM same subtle shifts from anatomy to psychology, the same kind of anatomical reason- ing, the same inadequate method of verification. Gall's methods were anatomical, not experimental. In fact he was explicitly anti-experimental, and his deep distrust of the experimental work of Flourens is only partly explained by the fact that Flourens' data did not substantiate phrenological doctrine.8' No attempt can be made here to evaluate either Gall's methods or his influence. Nevertheless, two aspects of his thought bear directly on the present discussion. The first is his systematic shift of the seat of psychological localizations to the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. This had important practical consequences for phrenological cranioscopy. It also made comparative psychologico-anatomical correlations more persuasive, for reasons which Willis could have appreciated. In concentrating the anatomical representation of psychological functions in the cortex, Gall recognized the crucial significance of that portion of the brain in which interspecific structural variation is most apparent. He thus produced an anatomically grounded psychology in which men and animals could be included together in a single system. Gall did not need structureless functions to account for man's psychological peculiarities. The second significant aspect of Gall's work follows from the above: Gall effected a clear separation of the psychological and the theological issues relating to the func- tions of the human mind. He divorced the mind from the soul. Through the debate which his work occasioned, the soul was at last shelved as a concept with which the scientist qua scientist needed to concern himself. Even phrenology's critics gradually ceded this point and by the 1840s generally confined themselves to attacking other portions of phrenological doctrine and practice.82 There was no agreement as to the nature of the connection between mind and brain, but Gall's insistenice that the correspondence was one-to-one no longer seemed dangerous. The road from Willis to Gall is much more complex than this brief sketch has indicated. Nevertheless, even this outline should suggest that this essay's two starting points contained in embryo the concept of biological continuity which evolutionary biology has since made part of our worldview. Both the anatomical method and the argument from design rested on the rigorous correlation of structure and function throughout the organic world-including man. Without changing any of the starting assumptions it was possible to discover that the examples discussed here were only apparently anomalous, and that the functional peculiarities which distinguish man from other animals have their structural manifestations in the fabric of the human body. 81 On phrenology, see R.
