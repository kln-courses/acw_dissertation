<plain_text><page sequence="1">film MAPANTSULA Directed by Oliver Schmitz Written by Oliver Schmitz and Thomas Mogotlane Produced by Max Montocchio and One Look Productions, South Africa, 1988 In Zulu and Afrikaans, with English subtitles Reviewed by Cheryl Dandridge-Perry M i' - Mapantsula, a complex, vibrant film, aligns itself with black Africa. In its exploration of black South African social and political iden- tity, Mapantsula draws closer to African film- making, which eschews the aesthetic and plot requirements of purely commercial cinema in order to focus upon African issues and iden- tity. Understanding the film may present some difficulties for non-South Africans as a result. The central debate is between two ways of coping with apartheid: the one organized, strategic, patient, and collective; the other, individual, careless, and self-deluding. Per- sonifying these strategies are Duma (Peter Sephuma), a community organizer identified with the youth and trade union movements, and Panic (Thomas Mogotlane), the main character. Panic embodies the anti-hero, a type familiar to black South Africans through literary tradition. Popular writers like Can Themba and Alex La Guma express township resiliency through tricksters, whose es- capades ultimately represent resistance to and rebellion against the system that has formed them. In contrast, Duma represents the older African value of solidarity-a soli- darity based not upon roles, but upon collec- tive activity. The dialectic between these two ideas depicts the complex of intrusions and collisions that is contemporary South African society. An openly partisan film, Mapantsula chooses to focus on the ideology of represen- tation. For example, the narrative subjectivity of Panic's story is constantly fractured by the political realities of the country, which even- tually subsume everyone. This interrupted narrative is used to explain and analyze how people like Panic and his girlfriend Pat (Thembi Mtshali) are dominated by white- controlled social structures. However, the film represents a radical reading of history that depicts the people as openly rebellious. To reflect this mood, the plot unfolds at sites of individual and collective resistance, con- flict, empowerment, and self-definition. Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not suffi- ciently exploit the potential of another mani- festation of defiance-township humor. The film opens with images of disruption. The patrolling army destroys a happy town- ship street game. Scenes of mass detentions portray nervous police trying to process singing detainees. We meet Panic, who has also been arrested, when he enters the jail cell and faces the critical, questioning gaze of the other detainees (the Comrades) who read his identity in his clothes and manner. Flash- backs then begin to reveal what has brought Panic into jail with the Comrades. Inter- spersed with these are scenes of the real-time course of events in prison that leads to Panic's final change of heart. These flash- backs seem to be very confusing to the audi- ence. Upon a second viewing, however, the careful construction of the film's visual mes- sage becomes apparent. Panic, whose cool demeanor belies his name, has survived by being meaner, faster, and more audacious than his fellows. Too intelligent and cynical to work at skivvy jobs that maintain white society, he has instead chosen to have that society maintain him by snatching purses from rich whites on the street. The white police bend rules for him in exchange for the information he provides. Consequently, Panic criticizes the others for their workaday jobs and announces that he is in control. Eventually, Panic's reckless, selfish behav- ior causes Pat to lose her job. Being unem- ployed brings her in touch with Duma, who is a sort of activist Everyman. He practices placing the good of the community first on the principle that he thereby helps himself in the most constructive way possible. Wearing different t-shirts to represent visually the var- ious organizations that form UDF (United Democratic Front), Duma acts as a liaison among youth, community, and worker groups, and embodies the force that the gov- ernment must neutralize through false con- fessions forced from such "weak links" in black society as Panic. Thus, Duma's more politically correct activism is contrasted with Panic's misdirected energies. As events unfold, however, Panic's actual powerlessness bears down on him. He finds out how painful it is to take charge of choos- ing who to be in South Africa. With him, the audience discovers the fine difference between reacting to events and having con- trol. Panic finally realizes that human agency is paramount, and that he must also be will- ing to give his life if he is to take his place with the others. Mapantsula is a significant film because it attempts to achieve a cinematic response to the political crisis in South Africa through fic- tional means. It cannot claim to be THE voice of South African resistance, for of course there are many voices. It is, however, possible to hail it as an authentic representation of political and cultural resistance because of its confrontational iconography. Director Oliver Schmitz's desire to reach a domestic audience led him to treat some themes circumspectly to prevent the film from being banned. He relies on South Africans to recognize the iconography through which these themes are expressed, an iconography that he says "resides largely in the relationships between people." As a result, some of the key points in Mapantsula are made so indirectly that a for- eign audience can easily miss them. Because language signifies both oppression and resis- tance throughout, much of the film's true sig- nificance lies in subtle interplays of language and image. For example, it is no accident that Panic speaks in Afrikaans when he is acting big in the township: he has learned to identi- fy acts of brutalization and theft with power, thereby internalizing apartheid. Language also plays a very important role in tracing the psychological turning point for Panic. This point comes when the interroga- tor Stander (Marcel van Heerden) finds out that Panic can-but doesn't-speak Af- rikaans. He correctly interprets this refusal as innate rebellion, and from then on relations between them change. It is unthinkable for Panic, as an angry African, to speak the boss's language to please him, and he eventu- ally links his instinctive resistance to the con- scious resistance of the Comrades. The language issue is also present in the film's visual shorthand. After one of his friends, a student, is arrested, Panic is briefly shown wandering through an abandoned school. This one swift image conveys the whole subtext of the 1976 Soweto uprising, which took place in schools over the issue of Afrikaans being forced on blacks. The dialectic of definitions between Stander and his black opponents is another example of crucial detail that can easily elude one. Here the Comrades assert to Stander that they are not criminals. Their dignified bearing in prison only strengthens their char- acterization of themselves, whereas the stream of contradictory and derogatory labels that issues from Stander ("criminals," "mon- keys," "terrorists," "communists," "tsotsis") results in his words losing all meaning. Instead, they become ideological propagan- da, products of Stander's own mental distor- tion. It is the demonstrated coercive force backing his words that finally identifies Stander as both oppressor and legitimate enemy. Though Mapantsula is a message film in which icons are employed-often in invert- ed form-for ideological effect, there is surprisingly little overt use of African "tra- dition" to represent essential Africanness. This may be because African ethnicity has been co-opted by apartheid and its African apologists (such as the homeland "chiefs") and so has to be used judiciously by oppo- nents of apartheid. In fact, the only tradi- tional ethnic figure in Mapantsula is the diviner, whose presence underscores how even urban sophisticates such as Panic share a deep, innate Africanness. More important- ly, however, the diviner guides Panic to the roots of African resistance. She does so by asking him what he can tell her of their peo- ple's history-a main strategy of which has been the ability to use traditional forms in 88</page><page sequence="2">response to contemporary crisis-which later makes him aware of his alienation from that font of strength. She also tells him that if he wants to receive, he must learn to give. The meaning of her spiritual message becomes clear to him when he observes the Comrades in jail. He sees them guide and support each other in maintaining discipline and focus, and cement their collective activi- ty through group song and dance, thus embodying the essential African value of solidarity. This value is sometimes expound- ed non-verbally, such as when the prisoners simply move in rhythm and hum, transmit- ting their deep solidarity through a collec- tive memory of ancient ways and translating that solidarity to a mass audience through the iconography of cinema. The film thus suggests that true Africanness can be con- sciously rediscovered in the spirit of older values-a spirit it locates directly in the structures of birthing a modern nation- rather than in the sentimental manipulation of superficial symbols of African ethnicity. By the end of the film no one has gained materially, but Panic (and, one hopes, the books Continued from page 32 ethnocentricity and aesthetics, her catalogue Sounding Forms: African Musical Instruments immediately brings such issues to mind. Sounding Forms contains essays and cata- logue entries by fifteen different scholars, but its underlying themes and organization are described in the opening essay by Brincard, its editor. Her approach is rigorously formal- istic; the objects in the publication are catego- rized as chordophones, membranophones, idiophones, and aerophones rather than by cultural role, region, or ethnic origin. The instruments are then further divided accord- ing to whether they are adorned with human or animal forms and whether full figures, partial figures, hands, or heads are represent- ed. As a result, Mangbetu harps are inter- spersed with those of the Fang, Senufo, and Mende, and similarly constructed instru- ments may be separated by more distantly related ones because the former display dif- ferent parts of the body. In her opening remarks, Brincard explains that only musical instruments incorporating anthropomorphic or zoomorphic images have been selected, ostensibly to provide a unifying theme for the exhibition and its cata- logue. The only object with no discernible fig- urative details, a wonderfully grooved mbira from Zaire (cat. no. 82), seems to have slipped in by accident. The reader is thus left with the impression that the sculptural form of the musical instrument, its workmanship, and the harmony of its parts are less worthy of aesthetic study than attached or incorporated representational images. In fact, Brincard evi- dently regards human or animal figures as "ornamentation" rather than as striking visu- South African viewer) gains a more sustain- ing identity. For ordinary South Africans, just seeing themselves and their problems authenticated in the myth-making dimensions of the big screen purveys a vision of the new reality taking shape. To Schmitz and his collabora- tors, this film-made inside South Africa by a mixed-race crew-represents that new reality. Making a film like Mapantsula is a process, as Schmitz says, "of breaking denial, of ceasing to live only a half-life," and of recognizing that one cannot stop doing things solely because one is told not to do them. This process reflects the spirit of mass resistance by which South African audiences will recognize themselves even in a character like Panic. Mapantsula engages viewers by dramatiz- ing the problems and events of their every- day lives, and in so doing challenges them to position themselves in the context it estab- lishes-that is, to choose who they would (or must) be. Although a black South African audience is not homogeneous, Mapantsula creates a deeper awareness of the circum- stances all blacks must face by depicting the al elements in a larger sculptural composition (p. 17). Her categorization of figures as isolat- ed decoration can be noted in some of the photographs, which do not allow us to see the entire instrument but display only the anthropomorphic image. The human figures forming part of an instrument are always illustrated in an upright position, even when (as is the case with the flutes from Burkina Faso) their orientation on the objects may have varied from piece to piece. Such exam- ples as these could have been photographed from better angles to remind us that African instruments were not meant to be viewed from a fixed perpendicular viewpoint. Brincard refers to the short section at the end of this publication that features sculp- tural representations of musical instruments as well as statues, reliefs, and goldweights of musicians. In her words, these are "related objects on which musical instruments them- selves, figured together with their players, have become ornamental elements or sculp- tures in their own right" (p. 17). Some minia- ture instruments are included in this category because they are primarily used as insignia marking social status and religious affiliation. However, since several of these pendants may have also been used to produce sound, they do not necessarily belong in this portion of the catalogue. Brincard is justifiably proud of having assembled an "extensive corpus" of musical instruments for this exhibition, all of whose 181 objects are illustrated in the catalogue. When an interesting work was unavailable for the show, its photograph and a full caption were placed in an appropriate section of the publication. Thus, two Baga drums with cary- atids, neither of which were on display, may moral conflicts and clashes within black South African communities. Even for whites, the message is clear; they will continue to become objects of individual acts of rage and repossession such as Panic's, because these are engendered by the same system that forces others, like Duma, into more organized acts of resistance. But in the end, the film sug- gests, even the unavoidable pain caused by apartheid can still be used consciously, for the common good. Moving with high drama from one town- ship scenario to the next, often with fine edit- ing and brilliant acting, Mapantsula entertains while addressing some of the most pressing urban realities of crisis-torn South Africa. Ironically, in the history of South African film, Mapantsula is far more impor- tant than the sequel to The Gods Must Be Crazy, produced by Jamie Uys, which has received better commercial distribution abroad. Despite its formal difficulties and insufficient attention to township humor, Mapantsula, which suggests that anyone can change, remains a refreshing work of opti- mism and confidence. D be studied in the catalogue and compared to Luba, Bembe, Loango, and Senufo works. The thirty-seven additional pieces are distinguish- able from the works originally exhibited only because they are assigned figure numbers rather than catalogue numbers; the length of these entries and the size of their photographs are consistent with those of the other 181 works. These additional catalogue entries allow Brincard to provide the reader with a more comprehensive group of images, includ- ing a broad range of object types. However, at least one piece in the exhibition (cat. no. 97, a Luba calabash probably used by the Buhabo society) may not have been made to produce music, and another example (cat. no. 122, an ivory horn with a highly unusual head) may not even be African. As an art historian, I found Brincard's opening essay troubling. I was particularly displeased by her misuse of the term "art-his- torical" to denote an exercise in formal analy- sis, as when she describes "the captions, which treat these objects in art-historical fash- ion as sculpture tout court" (p. 16). Several decades ago it might indeed have been acceptable for art historians to examine art objects in purely formal terms. However, self- respecting scholars in the field have not been discussing sculpture tout court for quite some time now. In all areas of art history, contextual and iconographic data are regarded as central, rather than peripheral, to discussions of form. Brincard's remarks also suggest that the aesthetic value of African musical instru- ments may be adequately perceived in their stripped, isolated museum existence, an assumption carried through the catalogue.
