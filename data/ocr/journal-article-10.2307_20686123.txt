This postponement ironically underscores a temporal feature of "anxiety" and "projection" inso far as both phenomena imply some form of futural orientation or conjecture, and often in the case of anxiety in particular, an experi ence of suspension or delay. While closely tied to temporal dynamics of postponement and anticipation, however, there seems to be a curiously spatial compo Qui Parle Vol. 12, No. 2 Spring/Summer 2001</page><page sequence="2">16 SIANNE NGAI nent to anxiety as well. In psychological parlance, for example, anxiety is typically described as an affective response to a projected, i.e., futural event, but it is also frequently invoked as something "projected" onto others in the sense of an outward propulsion or displacement: that is, as a quality or feeling the subject refuses to recognize in himself and attempts to relocate in another person or thing, usually as a form of naive or unconscious defense.2 Althusser refers to this kind of projection when describing his psychiatric eval uation in The Future Lasts a Long Time: "In my own case, it is strik ing that the most well-intentioned doctor in the world . . . projected on to me his own anxiety . .. [and] as a consequence of this projec tion and confusion, was partly mistaken about what was really hap pening inside my head. [My] doctor's attention was fixed on a specific anxiety which he passed to me rather than observed in me, thus shifting it from its 'object,' or rather from the absence or loss of any 'object,' to the representation of his anxiety projected on to me" (274, my italics).3 And yet this account of projection as the external izing trajectory by which anxiety becomes displaced seems para doxically internal to Freud's definition of anxiety itself, though never overtly elucidated by him as such. In his attempt to redefine neu rotic anxiety, for example, from its initial formulation as "fermented" libido (sexual energy transformed from being accumulated without discharge) to the experience of unpleasurable, endogenous excita tions subsequently treated as if they were coming from without, Freud's approach to anxiety shifts from viewing it as an "inside" matter to a matter of the very distinction between inside and out side. This conceptual shift comes to a particular head in Freud's eventual appeal to the experience of birth, an emergence/expulsion par excellence, as "the first experience of anxiety, and thus the source and prototype of the affect of anxiety."4 The notion of anxiety as already involving some form of out ward trajectory, prior to its being projected or displaced onto oth ers, is not only suggested by its prototypicalization in birth, but by a much earlier definition Freud articulates in an attempt to distinguish realistic anxiety from its neurotic form. Whereas realistic anxiety emerges in the context of an external threat, the latter seems to in volve an extra step: "In neuroses [the psyche] is overtaken by anxi</page><page sequence="3">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 17 ety if it notices that it is incapable of allaying a sexual excitation that has arisen from within. Thus it behaves as though it were pro jecting this excitation to the outside."5 This comment suggests that the externalizing mechanism of "projection" may in fact constitute part of the phenomenon of anxiety, as opposed to a psychic opera tion subsequently performed to one's anxiety - an implication re inforced by Freud's tendency, in later work, to equate projection with phobic avoidance in general,6 and by his proto-Kleinian view of projection, in the form of expulsion, as a trajectory retroactively constituting the very distinction between the ego's inner reality and outside world.7 And yet the exact nature of the relationship between anxiety and projection in Freud's work remains ambiguous for sev eral reasons. For one thing, the question of whether anxiety preex ists or becomes determined by "its" outward displacement, which Freud never asks directly, seems irresolvably circular. For another, Freud never ends up fully elaborating or providing a formal theory of projection, though he consistently refers to the mechanism in efforts to theorize phobia and paranoia.8 While Freud isolates it as a prospective object of analysis only to immediately postpone it as such, as we have seen, in his case history of Daniel Schreber,9 Laplanche and Pontalis note that "for the most part, when Freud mentions projection he avoids dealing with the matter as a whole" (LS, 352). Moreover, at times the concept of projection remains con spicuously absent from Freud's theory of anxiety where one expects it most, such as when the boy's "castration anxiety" is perceived as the carrying out of a paternal threat. Here it seems fully appropriate to claim the boy "projects" his fear of castration onto the father, relocating the experience of dread in an external source, and yet no mention of projection informs this particular account of anxiety as a gender-specific (and gender-determining) phenomenon. Thus the question of timing one normally associates with anxiety's affective grammar - "When will X happen?" - can also become a question of positioning, or where. By examining strik ingly homologous occasions of anxious dispositioning in texts by Herman Melville, Alfred Hitchcock, and Martin Heidegger, all in volving fantasies of the moody intellectual, analytical, or phi losophi cal subject as a thrown or airborne entity, I hope to show that the</page><page sequence="4">18 SIANNE NGAI externalizing aspect of "projection" which the image of thrownness hyperbolizes can be perceived not just as a strategy for displacing anxiety, but as the means by which the affect culturally codified as "anxiety" assumes its determinate form. The accounts of anxious subjectivity provided by these three authors, in which actual and phantasmatic acts of throwing reinforce the boundary between center and periphery, and thus the distinction between "here" and "yon der" on which the experience of threat depends,10 depict "anxiety" less as an inner reality which can be subsequently externalized or spatialized, than as a structural effect of spatialization in general. Moreover, in all three accounts of anxiety, the image of thrownness secures a strategic sort of distance for the knowledge-seeking sub ject, enabling him to differentiate "here" from "yonder" even in the absence of fixed and definite positions from which nearnesses and farnesses are ordinarily established or gauged.11 In Western intellectual history, "anxiety" seems to have ac quired a certain epistemological aura or cachet, having evolved into an all-purpose term stretching across knowledge formations and disciplinary vocabularies. Pointing to the overall prominence of phobia as a signifying economy in modern culture,12 expressions such as "anxiety of influence," "middle-class anxiety," and "millennial anxiety" use the negative affect they invoke as a way of immediately establishing a skeptical or critical stance towards the phenomena described. Yet in conjunction with its versatility as a critical framing device, "anxiety" also has a history of being gendered in Western culture, particularly in the discursive arenas where it has played the largest roles. Psychoanalysis is perhaps the most obvious example, since its primary model of gender differentiation, the cas tration complex, relies partly on affective categories to fully distin guish "masculine" and "feminine" attitudes towards a structural absence or loss. In response to this perceived privation, only male subjects are capable of experiencing genuine anxiety or dread ("When will the loss happen?"), while female subjects are consigned to the less traumatic and therefore somehow less profound, while certainly more sentimental and ignoble, emotions of nostalgia and envy. As Freud notes, in the case of little girls "we can hardly speak with propriety of castration anxiety where castration has already</page><page sequence="5">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 19 occurred."" The castration complex as originally formulated by Freud in his case study of Little Hans could thus be read (albeit somewhat perversely) as barring female subjects from anxiety as a subject determining orientation, while for the male subject this ambient phobia not only plays a privileged role in the process of gendered ego-formation, but comes to precipitate the formation of the pater nal super ego itself. Similarly, in the continental tradition of existentialist philoso phy, the privileging of anxiety as a key for interpreting the human condition (Sartre) is accompanied by its being secured as the dis tinctive - if not exclusive - emotional provenance of male intel lectuals. The agitated scholars and obsessive young men in Kierkegaard's pseudonymous writings, for example, seem fused in his description of Don Giovanni, the hypermasculine, Uber-hetero sexual hero of Mozart's opera, as "anxiety" itself: There is an anxiety in him, but this anxiety is his energy. In him, it is not a subjectively-reflected anxiety; it is sub stantial anxiety. In the overture there is not what is com monly called - without knowing what one is saying - despair. Don Giovanni's life is not despair; it is, how ever, the full force of the sensuous, which is born in anxi ety; and Don Giovanni himself is this anxiety, but this anxiety is precisely the demonic zest for life.4 While Kierkegaard is careful to distinguish this anxiety from melan cholia (vitalist to the core, Don Giovanni's life "is not despair"), in many ways the agitated male subject seems a modern variant of the male melancholic, a figure with a much older cultural history. It could in fact be argued that the unease or agitation codified as "anxi ety" eventually replaces melancholia as the male intellectual's sig nature affect or sensibility.5 By the nineteenth century, and in the wake of romanticism, Stephen Rachman argues, "cerebral activity and worry" had become a token of genteel literary culture and its "bookish lads" in particular.'6 Rachman notes that the connection between literariness and anxious agitation had become so cultur ally pervasive that in 1807, the clinician-author of A View of the Nervous Temperment [sic] could observe, "All men who possess</page><page sequence="6">20 SIANNE NGAI genius . . . are endued by nature with more than usual sensibility of nervous system."17 The heightened nervous sensibility ascribed by clinicians to "men of letters" in the nineteenth century could thus be viewed as paving the way for anxiety's privileged status in twen tieth-century attempts to assess broadly the spirit of the era, such as W.H. Auden's "Age of Anxiety," as well as in twentieth-century theo ries of emotion, from Silvan Tomkins' psychological studies of nega tive affect to Heidegger's phenomenology of moods. Considering its centrality across periods and knowledge forma tions (literary culture, philosophy, psychoanalysis), how does anxiety come to acquire its special status in Western culture as the distinctive "feeling-tone" of intellectual inquiry itself - while at the same time becoming codified as a distinctively, if not exclusively, masculine dis position? To approach these questions, this essay considers dramatic accounts of symbolic dis-positioning in three texts preoccupied with questions of emergence and the "moody organization"" of male knowledge-seeking subjects: Melville's Pierre, Hitchcock's Vertigo, and Heidegger's analysis of "anxiety" in Being and Time. In each case, the projective configuration anxiety assumes becomes inextricably bound up with the trajectory of a male analyst's quest for understand ing or interpretation. Thus while remaining firmly tied to questions of futurity in psychoanalysis (where castration, for boys, is "projected" as an anticipated event), and to the matter of time itself in Heidegger's analysis of Dasein's self-interpretative agency, in these texts "anxiety" nevertheless emerges as a general effect of spatialization involving thrown, hurled, or forcibly displaced objects. In wanting to highlight the spatial discourse returning to haunt anxiety's temporal definition, as well as how this disposition seems to have acquired its intellectual cachet across periods as well as disciplines, I have deliberately chosen to examine this phenomenon through a synchronic rather than diachronic constellation of texts. Yet all of these texts foreground, though in very different ways (filmic, novelistic, and philosophical), how the representation of anxiety, as an anticipatory structure explicitly linked to a male subject's quest for interpretative agency, oddly becomes dependent on a spatial grammar and vocabulary - from the way fleeing, turning, falling, and sinking come to inform Heidegger's analysis of anxious Dasein</page><page sequence="7">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 21 in terms of futural possibility (an analysis informed by Kierkegaard's own spatialized elucidation of anxiety as an encounter with an abyss), to the manner in which the anticipation of a castrating event in Pierre culminates in a fantasy of the male intellectual as a stone hurled through space. The topologies of dispositioning produced here, marked by physiological motifs of disorientation, dizziness, or vertigo, suggest that the logic of "anxiety" and that of "projec tion," as a form of spatial displacement, converge in the production of a distinct kind of knowledge-seeking subject. The Detective Where do we find ourselves? In a series of which we do not know the extremes, and believe that it has none. We awake and find ourselves on a stair; there are stairs below us, which we seem to have ascended; there are stairs above us, many a one, which go upward and out of sight . . .. All things swim and glitter. Our life is not so much threatened as our perception. Ghostlike we glide through na ture, and should not know our place again. - Emerson, "Experience" (1844) Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Here anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finite ness to support itself. - Kierkegaard, The Concept of Anxiety (1 844) Having described Vertigo (1958) in seemingly contradictory terms as "the most static thriller ..,. in the history of the movies" as well as "Hitchcock's most passionate film," one writer explains: "What</page><page sequence="8">22 SIANNE NGAI gets to you in Vertigo isn't anything so straightforward as visceral shock, but the stunned, hypnotic lassitude of its pace."19 This pecu liar rhythm perhaps sets Vertigo closer to the genre of the noir film than that of the gothic, though the film conspicuously borrows from both traditions. Accordingly, Vertigo presents its protagonist not just as a retired detective but as what Gavin Elster (the industrialist who hires him) calls a "hard-headed scholar," in keeping with the noir convention of depicting the private investigator as a democratized version of the male intellectual. The film's explicit spatialization of this male knowledge-seeker's phobia at first seems to follow, unsurprisingly, the logic of its setting's insistent verticality. Shot on location in Northern California, and featuring several of this steeply inclined area's zenithal landmarks (Coit Tower, the giant sequoias in the national park, the church tower at the San Juan Bautista mis sion), Vertigo uses the motif of physical disorientation to character ize Scottie's state of mind and repeatedly stages this experience at sites of high elevation. Here, the camera's famous track-out/forward zoom from an initial shot that establishes the "acrophobic" protagonist's point of view - looking down from a rooftop, as in the film's opening chase sequence, or from a stair similar to the one described by Emerson20 - dramatizes the sensation of dizziness Scottie experiences by suddenly attenuating the vertical distance depicted, creating the illusion of the ground sinking beneath his gaze. Paradoxically, as is also the case in Emerson's account of philo sophical vertigo, the viewer's perspectival identification with Vertigo's male intellectual, or the alignment of our viewing position with his, becomes securely fixed in an originary moment of spatial dis-posi tioning, or perspectival flux. Repeated at crucial times in the narra tive, this cinematographic maneuver seems to be Vertigo's most overt way of spatially rendering its male protagonist's dread, explicitly attuning our perception of exaggerated verticality to his. In spite of this configuration, however, Scottie's affective con dition remains irreducible simply to his officially diagnosed "fear of heights." For the organization of the male investigator's psychic ori entation could equally be described in terms of a horizontal oscilla tion between two sites of self-discontinuity, embodied in the figures of "Madeleine" and Judy (both played by Kim Novak). Radically</page><page sequence="9">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 23 externalized from themselves, and not just doubled but redoubled, both women are marked by a structural negativity, at all moments defined by who they are not, as much as who they are. Thus the film's romantic pathos hinges on Scottie's inability or refusal to per ceive Judy as Judy, seeing her rather as always not-Madeleine. Yet the figure Scottie first encounters as Madeleine is also not-Madeleine, not simply because she is Judy playing the part of Gavin Elster's wife, but because this "Madeleine," as part of her impersonation, is also at times not-"Madeleine" - that is, a subject herself subject to self-estranging possession by a dead woman named CarlottaValdez. Ironically, while Carlotta and Madeleine Elster provide the models that "Madeleine" and Judy copy, it is these authentic originals who are figured as "projections" of the latter, extending outward beyond the prevailing surfaces of the living women Scottie encounters. For while Carlotta and Madeleine Elster do not impersonate other women, and have identities outside of any relationship to Scottie, they are also strikingly occulted figures - violently absented or dead. Thus the film immediately confronts us with this paradox: it is the self-identical, non-dissimulative female presences in the narra tive who are perceived as phantasmic or supernatural; the dissimu lating, internally divided figures played by Kim Novak are the ones Scottie finds most actual or real. In this sense, the oscillation Scottie experiences cannot be in terpreted as a movement between fixed poles or discrete symbolic positions, since the two living women he woos (Judy and "Madeleine") are not only self-discontinuous modulations, but pre sented as surfaces for the casting of other feminine images. As "screens" on which other figures are projected, Judy and "Madeleine" are also openings or thresholds, liminal sites of flux and discontinu ity. Thus, as in A.J. Greimas and Jacques Fontanille's semiotic analy sis of "worry," "[w]hat we have is a perpetual hesitation within a mixed figure who cannot fix his terms," preventing the male pro tagonist from "effecting a polarization that would make a true sub ject of quest of him."21 Rather than traverse actual distances, the anxious subject tends to "wander," as Scottie at one point describes his occupation to "Madeleine" - a movement epitomized in one markedly protracted driving scene when Scottie's effort to tail</page><page sequence="10">24 SIANNE NGAI "Madeleine" leads him in a meandering progression of turns back to his own apartment. Analogously, for Greimas and Fontanille, worry is a motion without direction, as when one paces back and forth, defined as a zone of emotional in-between ness: Worry is no more than this oscillation that sets into place a simulacrum available for another passion. This oscilla tion brings about the shifting of the tensive subject with a view to his traversing more specific trajectories. Worry in a way prepares the way for other passions. It defines a certain constitution of the subject. It becomes particu larized only as a function of the passions that subse quently invest the simulacrum and provide it with a modal arrangement. (SP, 138-39) This characterization of worry as a generic or template-like affect (a state of undifferentiated psychic tension), reconfigures what one ordinarily perceives as a phobic construction into an oddly neutral affective state. As we shall see, Heidegger's similar approach to anxiety as a "basic" state of mind will enable him to posit it as the mood, among all others, most suited for acts of interpretation. Just as Heidegger approaches anxiety as a predisposition for interpret ing, Greimas and Fontanille describe worry as a form of presenti ment, a state of mind that "prepares the way" for more determinate kinds of dispositions. Yet while Vertigo's spatial rendering of its male hermeneut's phobia seems to enact a similar dynamic, "preparing" him, as it were, for the more specific passion of falling in love, the conspicuous surplus of female figures required for this shift to take place (no fewer than four), suggests that Scottie's "anxiety" is a feel ing less neutral than it would seem, that its symbolic configuration is, in fact, defined in a complex field of gender relations. But in what sense does Vertigo's spatial rendering of its protagonist's "moody organization" describe a trajectory of mascu linization, and how is this movement related to the one defined by the film's various projectile objects, most of which, paradoxically, seem to be feminine? The first question seems superfluous or redun dant (it would seem that the protagonist's masculinity is something established to begin with), unless we recall that the film follows its</page><page sequence="11">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 25 opening "primal scene" of Scottie's trauma with a scene deliber ately jumbling the cultural markers of gender difference. Like the bandaged and crippled figure played by James Stewart in Rear Win dow, we first encounter Scottie wearing what he calls a "corset" and restlessly playing with a cane, while his friend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) works at her job as a ladies' undergarment designer. At one point, Scottie's speech provides a voiceover for a close-up of her drawing, which features a female torso in a bra. The joke linking Scottie's corsetedness to impotence becomes an explicit one, which Hitchcock continues for most of the scene: Scottie: [Stretching to retrieve dropped cane.] Ouch. Midge: I thought you said no more aches and pains. Scottie: Yeah, it's this darn corset. It binds me. Midge: No three-way stretch? How very un-chic. Scottie: Those police department doctors have no sense of style. Well, anyway, tomorrow will be the day. Midge: Why, what's tomorrow? Scottie: Tomorrow? The corset comes off tomorrow! I'll be able to scratch myself like anybody else tomorrow, and I'll throw this miserable thing out the window and be a free - a free man. Foregrounded by the crucial placement of the pause, which creates a telling stammer, the process of becoming "a free man" is clearly at stake for Scottie at the film's beginning, anticipated rather than de termined in advance. This process of masculinization is specifically described in terms of forcibly ejecting a corset, or in Scottie's words, predicated on the act of throwing a "miserable thing" out a win dow. Yet Scottie's fascination with throwable corsets and other femi nine "objects" seems based on a more abstract preoccupation with the physics of "projection" in general. Midge accordingly appeals to mechanics rather than erotics, as might be expected, to account for Scottie's highly particular interest in a brassiere he finds in her</page><page sequence="12">26 SIANNE NGAI apartment. Responding to Scottie's quasi-scientific curiosity ("I've never run across one like that before"), she matter-of-factly explains, "Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but it does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge. An aircraft engineer down on the Peninsula de signed it. Worked it out in his spare time."22 Scottie's enthusiastic response, "Kind of a hobby - a do-it-yourself kind of thing," sig nals that this apparatus of bodily "projection" will come to serve as inspiration and model for his own "do-it-yourself," entrepreneurial effort to overcome his acrophobia, bringing the externalizing de sign or projective logic of the brassiere/corset, as throwable femi nine object, and the spatial configuration of the male investigator's affective condition into a rather unusual alignment. This conflation of topologies becomes increasingly dominant, however, as Vertigo foregrounds its male protagonist's growing anxiety in correspon dence with his developing quest for knowledge. Thus while the tra jectory of retired Scottie's own "spare time" investigation seems strangely anticipated by the motif of a thrown corset, and even more strangely motivated by the projectional design of a mechanically innovative, male-engineered brassiere, his pursuit of understanding eventually comes to involve a succession of encounters with nu merous other thrown feminine "objects" - a chain culminating in an identificatory fantasy of himself as projectile. Initially posed to Scottie as a red-herring task of disclosing the "truth" behind one woman's seeming possession by another, this phony line of inquiry not only leads to the male hermeneut's anx ious oscillation between "Madeleine" and Judy, female figures ren dered self-discontinuous by one another in actuality, but to the dead or occulted "originals," Carlotta and Madeleine Elster - the real women who in absentia paradoxically function as "projections" or phantasmatic extensions of the former. Thus if anxiety is "no more than this oscillation that sets into place a simulacrum available for another passion," the simulacrum set into place by Scottie's spatialized mental state seems to be one made available for yet an other imaginary structure - one that extends outward beyond the prevailing surface of "Madeleine"/Judy. Yet this prevailing surface, epitomized in the opaque silhouette "Madeleine"/Judy becomes in</page><page sequence="13">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 27 her darkened apartment (a flattened image that says, "Do I remind you of her?"), is itself a projection, since the two women forming the composite are extensions of each other. Thus the simulacrum Scottie encounters, in a film self-consciously preoccupied with the mental state of this male investigator, is one where the symbolic truth, to echo Slavoj Zizek's reading of Plato, ironically emerges via the "projection of projection" - a redoubling in which projection itself is projected back into "reality."" This is why, as previously noted, the realness of Carlotta and Madeleine manifests only through the mediation of fantasy, their status as self-continuous "originals" becoming apparent, to ourselves as well as Scottie, only after we first encounter them as imaginary extensions of the women who imitate them. This objectivity, a "projectedness" which emerges as the film's predominant theme, is significantly reinforced by the status of all four women as projectile objects, in each case forcibly hurled or thrown. Thus the imaginary act of ejecting a feminine object out the window in order to become "a free man," as anticipated in Scottie's quip about his corset/brassiere, comes to inaugurate a chain of events positioning Scottie as a helpless or coerced witness to the hurling of actual women. In this manner, his trajectory of re-masculinization becomes coeval with the "line of flight" characterizing the film's feminine minority, in the Deleuzean sense of a group determined not by its number of members, but by their displacement by social forces.24 When Scottie consults a local history buff about the origins of Carlotta, for example, the man explains she was the cast-off mis tress of a wealthy manufacturer who bore his illegitimate child: "I don't know how much time passed, or how much happiness there was, but then - he threw her away. He had no other children; his wife had no children. So, he kept the child and - threw her away. Men could do that in those days; they had the power, and the free dom." The characterization of Carlotta as "thrown away" by her capi talist lover explicitly mirrors corporate shipbuilder Gavin Elster's act of killing his wife by throwing her from the top of the mission tower, an act itself preceded by the imitation "Madeleine"'s act of throw ing herself into San Francisco Bay (in a staged suicide attempt in tended to replicate Carlotta's successful one). These dizzyingly</page><page sequence="14">28 SIANNE NGAI interlinked events of "being thrown" come full circle at the film's conclusion, as Scottie helplessly witnesses Judy's accidental fall from the same church tower where he previously witnessed "Madeleine" and Madeleine's faked and actual deaths. In this sense, all four of the women constituting the boundaries of the simulacrum Scottie finds himself in - each rendered "projec tions" or phantasmatic extensions of one another - are also literally thrown projections. This aspect gets accented in a grisly way by a shot of Madeleine Elster prostrate against the surface of the roof where her body lands, as if to evoke cinema's fundamental dependency on images hitting the surface of a screen. The performative redoubling of this spatial relation (a "thrown projection" is, after all, a tautological construct that enacts the same principle twice over, describing the projection of a projection, or the thrownness of something already thrown) reinforces the fact that each woman seems to constitute a template for the others on which to superimpose. In each case the projection's spectacular redoubling seems performed specifically as an event to be witnessed by Scottie. The throwing of "Madeleine" from the church tower, for example, as well as the act of hurling herself into the bay which prefigures it are deliberately orchestrated by Gavin Elster for his hired investigator's gaze. Accordingly, Scottie becomes increasingly attuned to and inscribed within this spatial logic as he grows affectively entangled in what at first seems a straightfor ward hermeneutic quest (one inextricably bound up with his quest of becoming a "free man") - to a point where the film's particular way of configuring his state of mind becomes virtually indistinguishable from its equally insistent and repeated enactments of "projection" in general. Given this coincidence, the importance of this point should be stressed: the logic of "projection" in Vertigo does not appear to signify, as it does in general psychology, a subjective operation whereby preexisting attitudes or feelings of the subject are attributed to others (i.e. the displacement of one's own, unacknowledged anxiety onto persons one feels anxious about), but designates the objective mecha nism by which the affect emerges. It is therefore less accurate to say that Scottie "externalizes" his anxiety as an already established, inte rior condition, or as something within his self that he rejects and subsequently locates in other persons; rather, the case is that his anxi</page><page sequence="15">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 29 ety is this dislocating and externalizing function - and as such, it emerges as the film's dominant symbolic or representational economy. Thus Scottie's affective organization and the trajectories de fined by the hurled objects he witnesses are not only isomorphic, but consubstantial. Scottie does not "project" his anxiety - his anxi ety is precisely the signifying logic which emerges through the mechanism of projection, in the temporal sense of "anticipation," but predominantly in the spatial sense of a movement outward. As with Jonathan Lear's theory of catharsis as emotional discharge, Scotty's anxiety "comes packaged" with its own logical (spatialized) explanation, an affect containing its own "theory" or formative prin ciple.25 Lear's observation that "the conceptualization of an [affect] is a development within the [affect] itself" (LP, 68) illuminates that in Vertigo, "projection" is not something which happens to Scotty's anxiety, but it is something like "a justification of its own occur rence" (LP, 50) enabling the affect to manifest itself as such, suggest ing that feelings may be retroactively constituted by the means and methods used to project, "discharge," "expel," or express them.26 Hence the film's convergence of trajectories (that of Scottie's quest for knowledge/masculine agency, the spatialization of his af fective "condition," and the pathway of objects hurled into space) becomes most pronounced in Scottie's dream: one narrative se quence in the film in which all four women seem co-present or at least metonymically linked together, and in which he explicitly fan tasizes himself as thrown. Framed by an exterior shot of Scottie's apartment featuring CoitTower in the near distance, whose blinking light seems to initiate the succession of images which follows, Scottie's dream stages his identification with "Madeleine"'s trajec tory as hurled object when it shows him walking in a cemetery and peering into an empty grave by an unmarked stone - an exact reenactment of the phony dream "Madeleine" describes to him as part of the possession hoax: "It's an open grave and I stand by the gravestone looking down into it." In the dream, Scottie's gaze into this site of negativity, or nothingness - a patch of blackness resem bling the opaque profile of "Madeleine"/Judy, strangely giving the impression of surface rather than depth - propels him into a fan tasy of himself as projected projection, a point Hitchcock empha</page><page sequence="16">30 SIANNE NGAI sizes by depicting his body (the "object" thrown) as a black silhou ette cast towards the same surface on which Scottie witnesses Madeleine herself flattened. Here the simulacrum of the dream brings forth, once again, the redoubling of the spatial relation, which in this case literally returns the subject to waking reality, depicting the entity projected as itself already "projection," qua two-dimensional surface or quasi-filmic image. In this manner, the dream sequence initiates a line of flight explicitly linking the projectional logic of Scottie's anxiety (as evinced in the fantasy of his fall) to an aversive encounter with nothingness. This is emphasized by the fact that the location from which his tra jectory emanates, the open grave, is fundamentally a dislocation or non-place. For having established Scottie's initial look at this empti ness, the film immediately stages the aversive turning of his gaze, not showing us the grave's interior, as might be expected from the camera's tracking movement towards it, but abruptly cutting to a highly defamiliarized, mask-like close-up of the gazer's face, a shot that in turn establishes Scottie as both witness and object of his own "projection" which follows. In this manner, the film oddly substi tutes the subject himself, and his outward propulsion in particular, for the hole or emptiness set up as the implicit locus of his original gaze. Recalling Kierkegaard's description of anxiety as having no object (or rather, as having "nothing" as its object), it seems as if Scottie's encounter with this objectlessness directly precipitates the phantasmatic substitution of himself as object, calling attention to his mood's spatial configuration. In reconstituting the male subject as thrown projection, the ex ternalizing structure of Scottie's anxiety discloses his role as part of the elaborate system of "projections" designed and overseen by the film's predominantly invisible or offstage males: the wealthy patri arch from "Old San Francisco," the corporate shipbuilder who runs new San Francisco, and the aircraft engineer (erstwhile bra designer) from the Peninsula. Success stories from American capitalism who symbolize the "do-it-yourself" mentality Scottie admires, these male entrepreneurs are strikingly among the few fixed or inertial subjects in the film, unaffected by the mechanical forces they set into play to which other characters in the film become subjected. The redoubling</page><page sequence="17">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 31 of projection in Vertigo thus discloses patriarchal ideology as what Pierre Bourdieu calls an "affective harmony of shared phantasms,"27 since the organization of Scottie's emotional state renders him as "ghostlike" as the thrown women he encounters, and much like the figure of the dis-positioned intellectual in Emerson's scene of stair case vertigo. Scottie's anxiousness emerges as a similar dispositioning, but one which reinforces the film's ironic critique of the emotional turbulence typically infusing the male subject's quest for knowledge - a pathos-ridden inquiry which begins with its intellectual in a cor set and culminates with him on a stair. Scottie ultimately differs, however, from the other hurled fig ures in the narrative, since in his case the redoubling of projection enables him to regain his equilibrium by the film's conclusion. The closing shot depicts Scottie obviously "cured" of his phobia, as we see him standing on the edge of the church tower gazing directly at the surface where Judy's hurled body has implicitly landed. In this sense, Vertigo could be described as a story of the process of restor ing a "sick" male spectator to "healthy" masculine viewership of images flattened against a screen by replicating the spatial logic of the viewer's original affect. While previously unable to gaze at thrown projections, Scottie regains the capacity to do so paradoxically by identifying with the thrownness of a feminine figure engineered by Gavin Elster. Yet the identification with "Madeleine" as hurled im age perversely inspires Scottie to continue the tradition of male "en gineering" that Elster represents, attempting to remake Judy into "Madeleine" by using the former as a template on which to cast the image of the latter. Only in replicating Elster's original operation does Scottie become fully aware of "Madeleine"'s status as "pro jected" even prior to her being thrown - an awareness that "re turns" Scottie to the stability shared by the film's other men. While the logic of Vertigo thus renders Scottie's moody organization con substantial with a projective dis-positioning, the act of projection is concomitantly claimed as a distinctly masculine prerogative. The safeguarding of this practice becomes clear in a scene early in the movie, when Scottie's friend Midge, excluded from his intellectual quest despite her efforts at involvement, attempts an analogous act of "projection" by painting her own face onto an otherwise exact</page><page sequence="18">32 SIANNE NGAI copy of Carlotta's portrait. While not dissimilar to Scottie's own use of Judy as a template for "Madeleine" (though Midge reverses the trajectory by superimposing the living woman onto the mythic one), Scottie reacts with revulsion so intense that Midge finally drops out as a potential co-investigator. Thus while persons of both genders remain equally subject to projection's mechanical force, the film's logic dictates that the operation only be actively performed by sub jects who are male - a privilege limited to aircraft engineers, cor porate shipbuilders, and retired police detectives alike.28 The Phenomenologist The doubly projective nature of anxiety in Vertigo, instigated by an encounter with negativity from which the male analyst, in what be gins as a hermeneutic quest for knowledge, withdraws and veers away as thrown, thus comes very close to the role "anxiety" plays with respect to the demonstrative pronoun "there" [Da] for Heidegger in Being and Time (1927), where anxiety's consubstantiality with a pro jective dis-positioning elevates it to "a distinctive way in which Dasein [Being-there] is disclosed." More specifically, this disclosure is that of Dasein's "'thrownness' ... into its 'there'; indeed, it is thrown in such a way that . .. it is the 'there.' The expression 'thrownness' is meant to suggest the facticity of its being delivered over" (BT, 174). For Heidegger, all moods or "states-of-mind" (but, as we shall see, anxi ety in particular) "disclose Dasein in its thrownness," but do so pri marily "in the manner of an evasive turning away" (175, original italics). The projective nature of Scottie's anxiety thus bears a striking resem blance to the aversive trajectory Heidegger attributes to mood [Stimmung] in general - as a mode of discovery paradoxically based on self-distanciation: In a state-of-mind Dasein is always brought before itself, and has always found itself, not in the sense of coming across itself by perceiving itself, but in the sense of find ing itself in the mood that it has ..,. in a way of finding which arises not so much from a direct seeking, as rather from a fleeing. The way in which the mood discloses is not one in which we look at thrownness, but one in which we [predominantly] turn away. (BT, 1 74)</page><page sequence="19">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 33 For Heidegger, thrownness not only "has the character of throwing and of movement" (BT, 223) but entails a form of surrender to the holistic complex of "the world," revealing its nature as a totality of contexts or involvements to which Dasein finds itself always already consigned, and hence "something by which [it] can be threatened": A state-of-mind not only discloses Dasein in its thrownness and its submission to that world which is disclosed with its own Being; it is itself the existential kind of Being in which Dasein constantly surrenders itself to the "world," and lets the "world" "matter" to it in such a way that some how Dasein evades its very self. (BT, 178) We can thus find the affective organization of Scottie's intellectual quest paralleled in what Bourdieu calls the "philosophically styl ized pathos" of Heidegger's analytic (PO, 10), insofar as both tra jectories insist on (and proceed from) the externalizing structure of moods. As Charles Guignon observes, "for Heidegger moods are not 'subjective' or 'psychic' in any sense," nor "fleeting experiences which 'color' one's whole 'mental attitude.'"29 As such, moods can not be grasped by turning "inward": "Having a mood is not related to the psychical in the first instance, and is not itself an inner condi tion which then reaches forth in an enigmatical way and puts its mark on Things and persons" (BT, 176; quoted in Guignon, 236, my italics). Contrary to a psychological theory of affect, where states of mind are in fact "inner conditions" disclosed by their extension outward into the world, for Heidegger "Being-in-the-world," as a relation of consignment to "thrownness" or externalization, is what states of mind such as "anxiety" disclose. Thus in divulging Dasein as always already thrown, much as Scottie's anxiety facilitates aware ness of his own status as surrendered to "projection" in Vertigo's elaborate system of projections, Heideggerean mood also imparts "the fact that Dasein is not brought into its Da of its own accord."30 As Giorgio Agamben puts it, "The originary discovery of the world is, thus, always already the unveiling of . .. a thrownness" to which Dasein has already surrendered (LD, 56). "Discovering" the world is thus not a matter of knowing the world, but consignment to one's "being delivered over" to it as something that "matters."</page><page sequence="20">34 SIANNE NGAI For the mood-preoccupied analyst in Vertigo, as we have seen, this consignment to "projectedness" is both disclosed through, and fundamental to, his quest for knowledge, as if his "anxiety" and his investigative practice were coeval trajectories. Similarly, Heidegger begins his discussion of a uniquely phenomenological method of in terpretation (the famous "hermeneutic circle") by immediately estab lishing moods as ontologically co-extensive or equiprimordial with understanding, the phenomenon which in turn grounds the existen tial structures of interpretation and discourse. Drawing on Kierkegaard's thesis in The Concept ofAnxiety of the indissociable relation between affect and concept, in which every cognitive structure is said to "pre suppose a mood" (so much so that "an error in the modulation" be comes "just as disturbing as an error in the development of thought"), Heidegger says that "state-of-mind always has its understanding and understanding always has its mood."32 Mood and understanding are not only equiprimordial, but organized by intimately related projec tile logics. Whereas mood discloses Dasein's "thrownness" as its "Be ing-in-the-world" (i.e. a mode of submission or surrender to the world), understanding actively throws or "projects" itself upon possibilities. According to Heidegger, this is because understanding has in itself the existential struc ture which we call "projection." With equal primordiality the understanding projects Dasein's Being both upon its "for-the-sake-of-which" and upon significance, as the worldhood of its current world. . . . Projecting has noth ing to do with comporting oneself towards a plan that has been thought out, and in accordance with which Dasein arranges its Being. On the contrary, any Dasein has, as Dasein, already projected itself; and as long as it is, it is projecting. As long as it is, Dasein ... always will under stand itself in terms of possibilities . . . . Projection, in throwing, throws before itself the possibility as possibility, and lets it be as such. As projecting, understanding is the kind of Being of Dasein in which it is its possibilities as possibilities. (145, original italics)</page><page sequence="21">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 35 Understanding, then, is the enactment of the same "mechanical" prin ciple to which Dasein has already been consigned (thrown), and to which it is made aware of being consigned through a state of mind. Having established the equiprimordiality and interpenetrability of mood (manifestation of thrownness) and understanding (a form of project ing), Heidegger examines interpretation as a phenomenon grounded in understanding, and discourse, in turn, as a derivative mode or by product of interpretation, one based on "the leveling down" of the primordial possibilities inherent in the latter.33 Continuing this process of "leveling down," language is subsequently analyzed as grounded in, or an offshoot of, discourse. Finally, "only after this discussion of lan guage has been concluded, is the everyday being of the 'there' pre sented in terms of the existential structure of falling" (100): the last of the four existentials which Heidegger uses to disclose "care" as the unifying structure of Dasein's being. For Heidegger, falling (into the world) is an existential mode of everyday Dasein revealed in the "interconnection" between idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity: the paler, everyday versions of discourse, un derstanding, and interpretation. In spite of its moral and theological implications, Heidegger insists that "the term does not express any nega tive evaluation," and must not be taken "as a 'fall' from a purer and higher 'primal status"'; nor as a "bad or deplorable ontical property of which, perhaps, more advanced stages of human culture might be able to rid themselves" (220). Rather, as a term "used to signify that Dasein is proximally and for the most part absorbed in 'the world' of its con cern," for Heidegger falling is "a kind of motion" (224) that constitutes an essential part of Dasein's topology. This "downward plunge [Absturz]" (223) is in a sense the opposite movement or counterthrust to the dy namic of projection. Whereas projection "presses forward" (184), fall ing "tears away": "Dasein plunges out of itself into itself, into the groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic everydayness ... .This down ward plunge ..,. has a kind of motion which constantly tears the un derstanding away from the projecting of authentic possibilities. .. . Since the understanding is thus constantly torn away ..,. the move ment of falling is characterized by turbulence" (223, original italics). Sounding not unlike an aircraft engineer, Heidegger uses this property of falling to clarify an aspect of "thrownness" hitherto unstated:</page><page sequence="22">36 SIANNE NGAI Falling is not only existentially determinative for Being in-the-world. At the same time turbulence makes mani fest that the thrownness which can obtrude upon Dasein in its state-of-mind, has the character of throwing and of movement. Thrownness is neither a "fact that is finished" nor a Fact that is settled. Dasein's facticity is such that as long as it is what it is, Dasein remains in the throw, and is sucked into the turbulence [of public everydayness]. (223, my italics) Like the offscreen male technicians in Vertigo, Heidegger functions like a "projectionist" in more ways than one: creating an abstract system in which beings are not only thrown but suspended in "the throw," recalling cinema's term for the crucial distance between projector and screen. The topology defined by Heideggerean moods thus emerges as a strikingly filmic one, turning on the relation be tween Dasein's status as thrown projection and the "screens" or possibilities on which it projects. Reinforcing this visual metaphor, Heidegger describes understanding's "projective character" as that which "goes to make up existentially what we call Dasein's sight" (186, original italics). The implicit "distance" between Dasein's site of projection, and the possibilities where thrown projections land, becomes the focus of Heidegger's interpretation of anxiety, which culminates in positing this affect as a distinctive method of gauging or estimating this distance or throw. This analysis of anxiety begins only after the discussion of fall ing concludes, establishing the holistic complex of Being-in-the world as fourfold: "falling and disclosed, thrown and projecting." Significantly, Heidegger introduces this particular state of mind in the context of searching for an analytic strategy that will make Dasein "accessible as simplified in a certain manner," enabling the "struc tural totality of Being... [to] come to light in an elemental way" (226). Heidegger lays out the problem as a methodological one, that of finding a way of "grasping the structural whole of Dasein's everydayness in its totality," or of bringing out Dasein's Being "in such a unitary. manner that in terms of it the essential equipri mordiality of the structures we have pointed out, as well as their</page><page sequence="23">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 37 existential possibilities of modification, will become intelligible." Heidegger then immediately turns to anxiety as a potential solu tion, describing it as "an understanding state-of-mind in which Dasein has been disclosed to itself in some distinctive way" (226, my italics), and thus as "one of the most far reaching and most pri mordial possibilities of disclosure . . . [lying] in Dasein itself." In working out this basic state-of-mind and characteriz ing ontologically what is disclosed in it as such, we shall take the phenomenon of falling as our departure point, and distinguish anxiety from the kindred phenomenon of fear . . .. As one of Dasein's possibilities of Being, anxiety - together with Dasein itself as disclosed in it - provides the phenomenal basis for explicitly grasping Dasein's primordial totality of Being. Dasein's Being re veals itself as care. (227, original italics) Not just a mood but a "phenomenon which functions methodologi cally" (230), anxiety's distinctiveness paradoxically comes to rest on its formulation as "basic," as if a generic template for moods in general. As promised, Heidegger begins the analysis of anxiety as this distinctive/basic state-of-mind by returning to his analysis of falling, previously defined as the existential structure of Dasein's absorp tion in the world of discourse and the public interpretations of the "they." Like the evasive way in which moods disclose thrownness, falling as absorption in this inauthentic realm "make[s] manifest something like a fleeing of Dasein in face of itself [as authentic potentiality]." Yet "to bring itself face to face with itself, is precisely what Dasein does not do when it thus flees"; rather, "it turns away from itself" (229). It is in this very act of turning away that Dasein "is disclosed 'there,"' revealing the disclosive, "interpretative" charac ter of the evasive maneuver itself. Having established "turning away" in falling as a mechanism of disclosure or interpretation, Heidegger suggests that anxiety per forms a similar function, and proceeds to demonstrate this by dis tinguishing it from fear. In fear one does not so much "flee," but rather one "shrinks back" (a weaker version of the former) in the face of something threatening, defined as "a detrimental entity within</page><page sequence="24">38 SIANNE NGAI the-world which comes from some definite region but is close by and is bringing itself close, yet might stay away." But since Dasein turns away from itself in falling, that in the face of which it thus shrinks back must, in any case, be an entity with the character of threatening; yet this entity has the same kind of Being as the one that shrinks back: it is Dasein itself. That in the face of which it thus shrinks back cannot be taken as something "fear some," for anything "fearsome" is always encountered as an entity within-the-world.... The turning-away of falling is grounded rather in anxiety, which in turn is what first makes fear possible. (230, original italics) Whereas in fear one shrinks back from a definite entity within the-world, in anxiety one flees from something "completely indefi nite" and "incapable of having an involvement." As Heidegger elaborates, "Nothing which is ready-at-hand or present-at-hand within the world functions as that in the face of which anxiety is anxious" (231).14 In Heidegger's affective topology, however, the "nothing" one encounters in anxiety is also a "nowhere," lacking a definite position or location in the world. In other words, "that which threatens cannot bring itself close from [a particular] direction," since "anxiety does not 'see' any definite 'here' or 'yonder' from which [the threatening] comes" (231). The combination of "nothing and nowhere" causes the world itself, Dasein's total network of involve ments, to assume the character "of completely lacking significance" (231): "The threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these 'says' anything any longer" (393). Yet this "nothing and nowhere" paradoxically makes manifest the world as such, in its lack of signi fying value: "The utter [a-signifyingness] which makes itself known in the 'nothing and nowhere,' does not signify that the world is ab sent, but tells us that entities within-the-world are of so little impor tance in themselves that on the basis of this insignificance of what is withi n-the-world, the world in its woridhood is all that still obtrudes itself" (231, my italics). This maneuver enables Heidegger to posit not only that "that which anxiety is anxious about is Being-in-the</page><page sequence="25">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 39 world itself" (232), since it brings Dasein "face to face with its world as world" (233), but that the "nothing and nowhere" about which it is anxious is its own "being possible."35 It is at this point that anxi ety, already privileged as a "distinctive" mode of disclosure "[fit] to take over a methodological function in principle for the existential analytic" as a whole, becomes elevated to an "individualizing" and redemptive mode of affective self-discovery. Anxiety rescues or "brings Dasein back from its falling," countering this movement by retrieving it "from its absorption in 'the world'": In anxiety what is environmentally ready-at-hand sinks away, and so, in general, do entities within-the-world. The "world" can offer nothing more, and neither can the Dasein-with of Others. Anxiety thus takes away from Dasein the possibility of understanding itself, as it falls, in terms of the "world" and the way things have been publicly interpreted. Anxiety throws Dasein back upon that which it is anxious about - its authentic potential ity-for-Being-in-the-world. Anxiety individualizes Dasein for its ownmost Being-in-the-world, which as something that understands, projects itself essentially upon possi bilities. Therefore ... anxiety discloses Dasein as Being possible, and indeed as the only kind of thing which it can be of its own accord as something individualized in individualization. (232) Anxiety not only "saves" Dasein from falling, but restores its indi viduality and capacity for projection (i.e. its capacity for understand ing and interpretation), which is precisely the outcome of the anx ious detective's trajectory in Vertigo. Anxiety's distinctive "throw" in Heidegger is in fact a mirror image of Scottie's pathway to recover ing his status as "free man." While grounded in the existentials of throwing, projecting, and falling, Heidegger's interpretation of anxiety as interpretative method ology implicitly rests on a fourth kind of "movement": the sinking of the "environmentally ready-at-hand" which counters Dasein's absorp tion in the world and its entities as meaningful or "saying something." As we have seen, Heidegger's thesis that anxiety distinctively and</page><page sequence="26">40 SIANNE NGAI uniquely discloses Dasein as "Being-towards one's most proper poten tiality for being" (232) rests on the idea that anxiety brings Dasein "face to face with the world as world," or as something a-signifying or insig nificant. But the disclosure of this insignificance occurs through the "motion" of recession or withdrawal: the world appears insignificant in anxiety only because "in anxiety what is environmentally ready-at hand sinks away" (232). While Dasein's thrownness, projection, and falling are carefully developed as existentials, however, this "sinking" of the environmentally ready-at-hand is not. Given the importance of modes of recession for Heidegger as a whole, the absence of phenom enological elaboration here is striking, particularly when contrasted with the detailed ontological analyses Heidegger provides of the other "kind[s] of motion" (223) concomitantly used to establish anxiety's unique interpretive function. If the world's spatial abatement or "sink ing" in anxiety is what manifests its insignificance, and thus what "brings Dasein back from its falling" (235), one wonders if the term's conspicu ous occlusion from existential analysis might not have something to do with the fact that the image of a sinking countering Dasein's falling raises a specter of relativity: is Dasein's falling or fleeing toward enti ties-in-the-world really a "downward plunge," or is this plunge really an illusion fostered by the downward dropping of the world itself? In any case, the "movement" of sinking in Heidegger's account of anxiety foregrounds how this "basic state-of-mind" enables Dasein to achieve a certain kind of distance even in the absence of the fixed positions by which distances are ordinarily determined, since the region from which anxiety "throws" Dasein back from falling, hence insuring its separa tion from that region, is not only a site lacking real coordinates but one already subject to spatial displacement. Given the proclamation of anxiety's "fitness to take over a meth odological function in principle for the existential analytic" as a whole, and that Heidegger's text is the very performance and demonstration of this existential analysis, the philosopher's interpretation of anxiety amounts somewhat to a comment on the moodiness of his own herme neutic practice: as everyday Dasein's existential interpreter, I neces sarily proceed from a state of anxiety, for this is the distinctive state of mind enabling me to define "the totality of Dasein's structural whole" (mood, understanding, discourse, falling) in a phenomenological ly</page><page sequence="27">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 41 unified manner. This is not to suggest or attempt, however, a critique of Being and Time based on a psychologization of Heidegger, which would be similar to attempting to dismantle a theorist's misogynist thinking based on the premise that it can be traced to his insecurities about "the woman inside him" (reproducing, in effect, the logic of psychological "projection"). Rather, my aim is to point out that anxiety's privileged position in Heidegger's phenomenology, as a form of projectilism reaffirming the distinction between "here" and "yonder," proceeds from claiming an initial position of strategic impotence or passivity. The individualizing freedom of "projecting upon possibili ties" ultimately remains grounded in one's initial surrender to being "thrown," just as in Vertigo, the recovery of masculine agency seems predicated on initially being in a corset. And in both accounts of anxiety, the image of thrownness guarantees the subject a crucial distance from sites of a-significance or negativity, even when these sites lack the definite, unchanging coordinates from which nearness and farness are typically gauged. The Metaphysical Novelist If "anxiety" thus takes on similar configurations in one analyst's at tempt to solve the mystery of feminine projection and regain his equilibrium as a "free man," and in another's attempt to rescue Be ing from fallenness in a fundamentally discursive world, the spatial organization of anxiety in Melville's Pierre (1844) interestingly com plicates these accounts by showing their concerns with gender and discourse to be intimately related.36 For in Melville's novel-length study of his intellectual protagonist's "moody organization," the prob lem of recuperating masculine agency raised in Vertigo, and the problem of recuperating Dasein's self-interpretative agency raised in Being and Time, explicitly converge through a spatial metaphor that encompasses both Pierre's destabilizing relations with women and his equally vertiginous struggles with texts and textuality. In doing so, Pierre reminds us that the nothingness or a-significance featured in both Hitchcock and Heidegger's accounts of anxiety is by no means a pure sort of nothingness, but one assigned to sites at once specific and yet by definition unfixed: to femininity in Vertigo, and to the sinking "world" in Being and Time.</page><page sequence="28">42 SIANNE NGAI Though Pierre's two main plot lines begin in separate settings, the story of his increasingly complicated and emotionally fraught involvements with women and that of his similarly fraught efforts to fashion himself as an American intellectual eventually twist together towards the end of the novel. This convergence comes to the fore in the important Book XXV (containing the triple sections "Lucy, Pierre and Isabel" - "Pierre at His Book" - "Enceladus") when in the midst of trying to write his own philosophical novel, Pierre's al ready unconventional domestic arrangement with one woman be comes newly re-complicated by the arrival of another. Here the protagonist's vexed relations with women and to philosophical lan guage become similarly spatialized, coinciding in an experience of bodily disorientation. Oscillating between an illegitimate sister masquerading as a wife (Isabel) and an abandoned fiancee who masquerades as a cousin and nun (Lucy), just as Scottie finds him self oscillating between Judy masquerading as "Madeleine" and "Madeleine" masquerading as a woman possessed by Carlotta, Pierre's growing agitation as a writer becomes inextricably linked to his conflicted allegiances to women whose social and symbolic roles are made increasingly difficult to categorize or define.37 Thus upon hearing a sailor call out, "Steer small, my lad; 'tis a narrow strait thou art in!" referring to the sight of Pierre "with both Isabel and Lucy bodily touching his sides as he walked" (353), Pierre experi ences a "sudden tremble" exactly mirroring the convulsions accom panying the "terrible vertigo" he feels while attempting to write his metaphysical novel. That effort is similarly characterized, in nauti cal terms, as a precariously constricted passage: "His soul's ship foresaw the inevitable rocks, but resolved to sail on, and make a courageous wreck" (339, "Pierre at His Book"). Like the corridor in which Pierre dramatically pauses "between the two outer doors of Isabel and Lucy" (358) (where the feminine figures are redefined as liminal sites - openings or thresholds rather than fixed or stable positions), Pierre's attempt to write positions him in a "narrow strait" which likens authorship to claustrophobia: "Through [his] lashes he peered upon the paper, which so seemed fretted with wires." Here the narrow straits are produced by Pierre's own body, and the trans formations it undergoes due to his agitated efforts at writing - nega</page><page sequence="29">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 43 tive encounters with language which render him a "most unwilling states-prisoner of letters" (340). Just as Moby-Dick stages the "unlettering" of "unlettered Ishmael" through his hermeneutical obsession with the whale as text, Pierre's unhappy efforts at philo sophical writing and reading lead to entanglement and exhaustion.38 The "terrible vertigo" Pierre encounters in writing and women is consolidated in the figure of Isabel herself as a site of textual negativity: "So perfect to Pierre had long seemed the illuminated scroll of his life so far, that only one hiatus was discoverable by him in that sweetly-written manuscript. A sister had been omitted from the text. He had mourned that so delicious a feeling as fraternal love had been denied him. Nor could the fictitious title, which he so often lavished on his mother, at all supply the absent reality" (11 12). As Priscilla Wald notes, citing this passage, Isabel's status as textual lack or nothingness places her as an "alternative discourse" to Pierre: "Devoid of primary [social] relationships, she is unformed humanity, the exact opposite of her pampered brother."39 Accord ingly, throughout Pierre the adult Isabel speaks an excruciatingly infantile language - not far from the "two childish languages" she describes herself "chattering" as an actual child (117). (By the end of the novel, Isabel still refers to herself in the third person and in the diminutive: "Far, far away, and away . .. Bell must go!"[355]). Since the story of her socialization occupies three chapters and spans almost to adolescence, infantile Isabel's unusually protracted entry into the symbolic order also brings forth a relation to language strik ingly different from that of Pierre, though similar in its affective to nality. Whereas Pierre finds himself confused by "speechless thoughts," or an inability to translate pre-existing cognitions into words, Isabel attributes her own "bewilderings" to a form of thought less speech, or to the fact that for her language precedes all con scious activity: "I never affect any thoughts . .. but when I speak, think forth from the tongue, speech being sometimes before the thought; so often, my own tongue teaches me new things" (123). Seeming to inhabit, as it were, an entirely different signifying regis ter, Isabel's socialization "from the tongue" is significantly facili tated by a euphoric encounter with an actual infant, an event which Isabel describes as endowing her with "the power of being sensible</page><page sequence="30">44 SIANNE NGAI of myself as something human" (122), and which constitutes a cru cial phase in her development as a linguistic being. In a scene of identification not unlike Lacan's mirror phase, Isabel's face-to-face encounter with the baby inaugurates a sense of herself as a bounded self, and enables her to acquire the capacity for differentiating self from others. This capacity is strangely described in terms of the abil ity to differentiate persons from rocks. As Isabel puts it, "This beau tiful infant first brought me to my own mind, as it were; first made me sensible that I was different from stones ... first undid in me the fancy that all people were as stones" (122, my emphasis). Wald suggests that "Isabel points to a world beyond language, a chaotic world that lacks coherence and meaning in general" (111, my emphasis). Given that Isabel's own "singular infantileness" (140) does seem to set her apart from the highly cultured and socially privileged Pierre, who is, as Wald observes, fully indoctrinated into the symbolic order of language and patriarchal law, it is tempting to describe her "alternative discourse" as a version of Kristeva's femi nine semiotic, and accordingly, to assign Isabel's initial inability to distinguish humans from stones to the primordial signifying dimen sion which she seems to embody. Yet since pierre is French for "stone," and Pierre's eponymous protagonist is later compared to (1) an anthropomorphic boulder thrown off the side of a patriarchal mountain and (2) a statue rotating on a pedestal, Isabel's original "fancy that all people were as stones" is less naive or far-fetched than it seems. Far from being incoherent or meaningless, Isabel's "presymbolic" tendency to blur stones and humans together in fact anticipates her hyper-literary brother's own fantasy about being a stone - one which becomes central to the novel's spatialized rep resentation of his intellectual anxiety. Melville's general fascination with sites of nothingness - evinced not only in Isabel's characterization as a textual absence, but in de scriptions of the whale as the "naught beyond" a wall (Moby-Dick), the fantasy of an enclosed hollow within the hollow of a central chim ney ("I and My Chimney"), or the "deadly space between" an office and a closet containing a corpse (Billy Budd) - is brought to the fore in Pierre during the eponymous protagonist's encounter with a "hor rible interspace" formed by a massive and precariously hanging rock:</page><page sequence="31">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 45 It was shaped something like a lengthened egg, but flat tened more; and, at the ends, pointed more; and yet not pointed, but irregularly wedge-shaped. Somewhere near the middle of its under side, there was a lateral ridge; and an obscure point of this ridge rested on a second lengthwise-sharpened rock, slightly protruding from the ground. Beside that one obscure and minute point of contact, the whole enormous and most ponderous mass touched not another object in the wide terraqueous world. It was a breathless sight to see. One broad haunched end hovered within an inch of the soil, all along to the point of teetering contact; but yet touched not the soil. Many feet from that. . . the vacancy was considerably larger, so as to make it not only possible, but convenient to admit a crawling man. As an "enormous and most ponderous mass" under continual threat of collapse, the patriarchal rock also points to its own status as ponderous yet teetering symbol. Claiming to have discovered the rock, which he originally names the Memnon Stone (after the King of Egypt), Pierre ends up consulting a "white haired old kinsman" as to the source of its enigmatic initialing: "Who, - who in Methuselah's name, - who might have been this 'S. ye W.?"' This paternal scholar informs him that the writer was most likely "[King] Solomon the Wise" (133). The stone is also linked to male authority figures associated with the New World and its "discovery": Columbus and Captain Kidd. Given this superabundance of mythic patriarchs, an explicit congruence is established between the "ponderous mass" Pierre apostrophizes and the massive rock formation to which Melville dedicates his novel: "The majestic mountain Greylock - my own more immediate sovereign lord and king." In a not-subtle mirroring of Melville's comically over serious, rhetorical prostration before the Pittsfield, Massachusetts rock, also called Saddleback Mountain ("I here devoutly kneel, and render up my gratitude, whether, thereto, The Most Excellent Purple Majesty of Greylock benignantly incline his hoary crown or no"), we find Pierre invoking and addressing, with similarly overblown rhetoric, the "Mute Massiveness" of Saddle Meadows' Terror Stone:</page><page sequence="32">46 SIANNE NGAI Eyeing the mass unfalteringly ... he threw himself prone upon the wood's last year's leaves, and slid himself straight into the horrible interspace, and lay there as dead. He spoke not, for speechless thoughts were in him. These gave place at last to things less and less unspeakable; till at last, from the very brow of the beetlings and the menacings of the Terror Stone came the audible words of Pierre: - "If the miseries of the undisclosable things in me, shall ever unhorse me from my manhood's seat, if to vow myself all Virtue's and all Truth's, be but to make a trem bling, distrusted slave of me; if Life is to prove a burden I can not bear without ignominious cringings; if indeed our actions are all foredained, and we are Russian serfs to Fate; if invisible devils do titter at us when we most nobly strive; if Life be a cheating dream, and Virtue as unmean ing and unsequeled with any blessing as the midnight mirth of wine ... then do thou, Mute Massiveness, fall on me! Ages thou hast waited; and if these things be thus, then wait no more; for whom better canst thou crush than him who now lies here invoking me?" (134-35, my italics) Though Pierre's sense of menace initially derives from the "hor rible interspace" within the structure he encounters, his soliloquy displaces this menace onto the material structure itself - a shift prefigured by Pierre's act of renaming it the "Terror Stone." "Terror" thus becomes a property of the stone itself, rather than an emotion precipitated by Pierre's relation to a negative space within it. Refor mulated as the terror posed by a ponderous substance ("do thou, Mute Massiveness, fall on me"), rather than the original danger posed by a nothingness or void, this reconceptualization of anxiety hinges on Pierre's act of rendering himself the "object" of the substance's gravitational force. Much like Scottie's encounter with the open grave in his dream, which immediately precipitates his fantasy of being hurled in space, Pierre's rhetorical self-transformation into an entity potentially crushed, crumbled, or "unhorsed" takes place as an aver sive turn from negativity. In place of the objectlessness which origi nally confronts him, Pierre's substitution of himself as "object" thus</page><page sequence="33">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 47 enacts a form of symbolic dis-positioning mirrored by the numer ous passive constructions, as Wald observes, used to characterize him as a victim of emotional dispositions or moods: "A sudden, unwonted, and all-pervading sensation seized him" (395); "a tem porary mood . . . invaded [his] heart" (240); "the specializing emotion ... seized the possession of his thoughts, and waved [a thousand forms] into his visions" (50). Significantly, it is in the very act of making himself this "object" (through the act of addressing the stone) that precipitates Pierre's fantasy of himself as being forc ibly displaced or hurled from "manhood's seat." Pierre's reconceptualization of threat in his Terror Stone ad dress thus culminates in a new definition of "anxiety," as a form of masculine dispositioning based on projectilism. This particular spa tial organization is brought to the fore in the novel's famous Enceladus fantasy, a dream which significantly follows one of Pierre's failed attempts to write. Here the event of becoming a thrown "stone," as the imaginary act anticipated during the Terror Stone encounter, becomes realized in a fantasy caused by a state of disorientation similar to the "terrible vertigo" elsewhere associated with the novel's other main site of negativity: the "unknown, foreign feminineness" embodied in Isabel: A sudden, unwonted, and all-pervading sensation seized him. He knew not where he was; he did not have any ordi nary life-feeling at all. He could not see; through instinc tively putting his hand to his eyes, he seemed to feel that the lids were open. Then he was sensible of a combined blindness, and vertigo, and staggering; before his eyes a million green meteors danced; he felt his foot tottering ... he put out his hands, and knew no more for the time. (314) The similarity between this state of mind and the "whirlingness" Isabel describes in her own account of acquiring language is brought forth in Melville's description of the psychic conditions informing the act of writing under which Pierre nevertheless persists: "Against the breaking heart, and the bursting head; against all the dismal lassitude, and deathful faintness and sleeplessness, and the</page><page sequence="34">48 SIANNE NGAI whirlingness, and craziness, still like a demigod he bore up" (339). In the face of this vertigo (one characterized by a string of phenom enological substantives almost directly corresponding to Isabel's ex perience of "the stupor, and the torpor, and the blankness, and the dimness, and the vacant whirlingness of the bewilderingness" [122]), Pierre's acts of writing become acts of aversion, much in the same way his encounter with the "horrible interspace" does - as if to posit language itself as an analogous site of negativity. This turning away is reinforced by Pierre's physical gesture of averting his gaze: "Sometimes he blindly wrote with his eyes turned away from the page ... he had abused them so recklessly, that now they abso lutely refused to look on paper. He turned them on paper, and they blinked and shut. The pupils of his eyes rolled away from him in their own orbits" (340, 341). It is precisely from this state of mind, one defined by an aver sive trajectory arising specifically from a struggle between male sub ject and text, from which the Enceladus fantasy emerges: "[Once] again the pupils of his eyes rolled away from him in their orbits: and now a general and nameless torpor . .. seemed stealing upon him." As the narrator proceeds, During this state of semi-unconsciousness, or rather trance, a remarkable dream of vision came to him. The actual artificial objects around him slid from him, and were replaced by a baseless yet most imposing spectacle of natural scenery. But though a baseless vision in itself, this airy spectacle assumed very familiar features to Pierre. It was the phantasmagoria of the Mount of the Titans, a singular height standing quite detached in a wide soli tude not far from the grand range of dark blue hills encir cling his ancestral manor. (342) In this hallucinatory return to the pastoral selling of Saddle Meadows and its rocky patriarchal ruins, the "baseless yet most im posing" configuration of Pierre's fantasy recalls the teetering yet pon derous structure of the Memnon Stone: the mass that eventually supplants the negative space it surrounds as locus of Pierre's anxiety or dread. Within the dream, Pierre explicitly identifies himself with</page><page sequence="35">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 49 "Enceladus," another anthropomorphic stone, named after the mytho logical son of Titan. This stone is described as hurled from the sides of the patriarchal mountain "Titan" and lying "shamefully recumbent at its base" (346). Scattered among other "recumbent sphinx-like shapes thrown off the rocky steep," the "American Enceladus" Pierre con fronts in his trance becomes a mirror image of himself: "'Enceladus! it is Enceladus!' - Pierre cried out in his sleep. That moment the phantom faced him; and Pierre saw Enceladus no more; but on the Titan's [dismembered] trunk, his own duplicate face and features magnifiedly gleamed upon him with prophetic discomfiture and woe. With trembling frame he started from his chair, and woke from that ideal horror to all his actual grief" (346). Here the two "stones" from Saddle Meadows, the American Enceladus and the anxious pierre, become explicitly conflated. By the end of the fantasy, however, the object "wrested" and hurled from the precipice is eventually depicted as an object which hurls itself back at the paternal "mass" with a force comparable to that with which it was initially violently detached: "No longer petrified in all their ignominious attitudes, the herded Titans now sprung to their feet; flung themselves up the slope; and anew battered at the precipice's unresounding wall. Foremost among them all, [Pierre] saw a moss-turbaned, armless giant, who despairing of any other mode of wreaking his immitigable hate, turned his vast trunk into a battering-ram, and hurled his own arched-out ribs again and yet again against the invulnerable steep" (346). In shifting the American Enceladus from an object "thrown off from the rocky steep" to a "no longer petrified" entity capable of throwing itself against this steep, Pierre's dream performs a redou bling of "projection" which culminates in the restoration of mascu line agency, much as the corseted, thrown subject in Vertigo eventually regains his status as free man and active thrower of projections. In both cases, the male subject's anxiety assumes this projective charac ter in the act of averting or turning away from "horrible interspaces" or instances of radical negativity. Like the grave that marks an area Scottie's gaze cannot fix itself upon or actually reach, and from which it can only turn away, or the "nothing-and-nowhere" in Heidegger's analysis of anxiety that occasions Dasein's fleeing or the aversive turn</page><page sequence="36">50 SIANNE NGAI ing of its "sight," the absence of a "there" to orient the male subject in the world around him provides the occasion for a dis-positioning that subsequently delivers him over to this "there" as thrown. Thus the redoubling or projection of projection in the Enceladus fantasy, as in Scottie's dream and Heidegger's philosophy, counters the directionless oscillation Pierre initially experiences in face of the "unknown, for eign feminineness" embodied by Isabel, with a trajectory enabling the male subject to regain some form of situatedness in the world, albeit in the form of a transient dream, and in the form of precipitate object consigned to its being in the throw. While doing so, however, the projective character that Pierre's "anxiety" comes to assume, as a form of dis-positioning marked by an implicit movement from agent to object, center to periphery, performs a more conservative function as well. For, as is the case in Heidegger and Hitchcock's similarly spatialized renderings of the male analyst's distinctive mood, the externalizing trajectory which anxiety becomes secures this disposition as a form of self-liberation (albeit only as fantasy in Melville's text), based precisely on the claim to "peripheral" status which this movement makes available. The way to freedom via projection, like Scottie's pathway to becoming a free man, or the freeing of Dasein for its authentic possibilities through its disclosure in anxiety as thrown projection, occurs only in claiming an initial "surrender" to thrownness that registers in the form of impotence or passivity. In each case, the projective charac ter assigned to "anxiety" enables it to function as a way of recover ing the subject's masculine or interpretative agency by propelling him up and away from the "horrible interspaces" which subject him to directionless oscillation, sites already placed in abeyance by be ing characterized as "nothing and nowhere." As Heidegger's text demonstrates in particular, in shifting focus from the occasions of this negativity (femininity in Vertigo and Pierre, forms of discursive a-signifyingness in Pierre and Being and Time), and relocating the threat to "nothingness" itself, which sheds its status as a property fixed to a specific structure or entity and becomes a substantive, "anxiety" acquires a strangely "basic" status as an affect without determinate object or target - as reflected in numerous descrip tions by psychologists and contemporary philosophers of emotion</page><page sequence="37">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 51 of anxiety's characteristic lack of "directedness" or intentionality. Greimas and Fontanille go as far as to suggest that anxiety presents a case of pure "phoria" prior to its polarization in terms of euphoria and dysphoria, as a neutral, value-free "protensivity" or "soft chaos of nonarticulated tensions" (SP, 6). Yet contrary to being an "indefi nite flatness" that suspends the assignation of values (SP, 6), Melville, Hitchcock, and Heidegger's formulations suggest.that anxiety is in fact object-directed, but only in the negative sense: as an aversive turning "away from," rather than a philic movement "towards." "Anxiety" nonetheless comes to assume its prominent role in struc turing the "philosophically stylized" quests for truth, knowledge, and mascul i ne agency featured i n Pierre, Vertigo, and Being and Time, pre cisely as a way of rescuing the intellectual from his potential absorp tion in sites of a-significance or negativity. Moreover, the fantasy of thrownness central to each representation of anxiety enables the intel lectual to achieve a strategic form of distance without the fixed or un changing positions on which the concept of distance typically depends, since the sites from which the intellectual flees are either revealed as non-places lacking real coordinates, or as feminine/discursive sites al ready subject to projection and displacement, "sinking," retreating, or already in the throw. Yet in each topology, whether created by the throw ing of corsets, projections, or stones, "anxiety" emerges as a form of dispositioning that paradoxically relocates, re-orients, or repositions the subject thrown, as Heidegger puts it, performing an "individualiza tion" that restores and ultimately validates the trajectory of the analyz ing subject's inquiry. There is a form of "revolutionary uplift" which anxiety's projective character makes available to the intellectual sub ject, in other words, that directs attention away from the questions of "sinking" worlds, "horrible interspace[s]," and "unknown, foreign feminineness[es]" as quickly as it raises them, such that this moody organization might also be described as an immediate turning away from the very occasions of the subject's aversion. If the question of aversiveness to negativity is precisely what "anxiety" veers away from or postpones, it may be that this form of distanciation plays some role in the affect's auratic appeal and overall prominence in cultural narra tives of intellectual life, and more specifically in its codification as the male knowledge-seeker's distinctive yet basic state of mind.</page><page sequence="38">52 SIANNE NGAI My thanks to the following for their input on this essay: Thalia Field, Barrett Watten, Lawrence Buell, Dan Farrell, Kevin Killian, and the editors of Qui Parle. 1 Sigmund Freud, On the Mechanism of Paranoia," General Psychological Theory, ed.

Hereafter JL. 2 6 Sue Campbel I argues th is thesis extensively Interpreting the Personal (Ithaca: Cornel I University Press, 1997). See especially "Expression and the Individuation of Feel ing" (46-74). Jonathan Lear's study of Freudian catharsis suggests a similar point of view. In Love and Its Place in Nature, Lear reexamines Freud and Breuer's early papers on hysteria in order to problematize their early definition of catharsis as a type of emotional discharge, or the expulsion of an individuated substance as for eign body. He stresses that the discharge or purgation of "psychic energy" typically ascribed to catharsis in early psychoanalytic theory is actually a theoretical fantasy of discharge or purgation, one described by the hysterical patient (Anna O) herself, though not explicitly conceptualized by her as such. Thus, "the case of Anna O shows us, right at the beginning of psychoanalysis, that... archaic mental life has a 'theory' of the mind's own workings.... Her 'theory' was expressed at the same archaic level of mental functioning as the rest of her fantasies: she experienced [psychoanalysis' therapeutic] catharsis as a corporeal ized discharge" (36). Lear ar gues, however, that the "theory's" phantasmatic nature does not necessarily imply its invalidity. Since "even the most archaic unconscious mental process contains within it an implicit, fantasied 'theory' ofthat process" and this theory of the mental process "is part of the person's (perhaps unconscious) experience of that process," Lear notes that "the fantasied 'theory' becomes part and process of the mental pro cess itself, and in altering the fantasy one alters the mental process itself." Though Lear does not make this point directly, his argument that, in giving conscious, con</page><page sequence="40">54 SIANNE NGAI ceptualized expression to one's emotional life or "archaic fantasies of mental func tioning" in language, "one is able to influence the fantasy and thus the mental func tioning which embodies and expresses that fantasy" (38), comes close to Campbell's suggestion that feelings, as forms of "mental functioning," are individuated by their expressions. 27 Pierre Bourdieu, The Political Ontology of Martin Heidegger, trans. Peter Collier (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), 10. Herafter PO. 28 Scottie's anxiousness, as projective dis-positioning, thus becomes posited as an odd sort of symbolic homeopathy: as a subject previously disturbed by and un able to gaze at "thrown" images, by the end of the film he becomes a normative viewer by acquiring the skill of throwing them, i.e. reenacting the same external izing principle underlying his original phobia. Here we should recall that Elster deliberately seeks to enlist Scottie, precisely in his role as anxious skeptic or ob server, as part of his initial scheme. Foregrounding Scottie's unknowing collabora tion with Elster in the act of constituting female subjects as "thrown," Vertigo's schematization of its male knowledge-seeker's dread thus reveals one of the most perverse paradoxes of American capitalism's "do-it-yourself" ideology ? whereby a subject's awareness of his inscription within a system of power becomes predi cated on replicating its functions. Thus the condition for the male subject's realiza tion of himself as a subject enmeshed in the economic system Elster represents ? one in which women can be, as the historian notes, always already projected and then thrown away ("Men could do that in those days; they had the power, and the freedom") ? is active participation in the production of self and others as pro jected projections. For Scottie's final understanding of his collaborative role in Elster's machinations (an arrival that coincides, significantly, with the "curing" of his anxious condition, as if in psychological reward for this self-awareness) ulti mately depends on subjecting Judy to the same acts of projection used by Elster to concoct the fiction of "Madeleine" needed to kill his wife ? replicating what Elster does down to sartorial details. 29 Charles Guignon, "Moods in Heidegger's Being and Time," What Is an Emotion?, ed.

Macann (London: Routledge, 1996), 100. 34 The claim that anxiety, unlike fear, has no concrete thing or "entity within-the world" as its object, is by no means an original thesis; this particular point, like much of Heidegger's discussion of falling and ambiguity, comes straight from Kierkegaard in The Concept of Anxiety. "I must point out that [anxiety] is alto</page><page sequence="41">MOODY SUBJECTS / PROJECTILE OBJECTS 55 gether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite ... the relation of anxiety to its object [is] to something that is nothing" (CA, 42, 43). Kierkegaard's distinction recurs in Freudian psychoanalysis ("[Anxiety] has a qual ity of indefiniteness and lack of object. In precise speech we use the word "fear" [Furcht] rather than "anxiety" [Angst] if it has found an object"), and in writings of ex i stenta lists as well: "Anxiety differs from fear in that the object of anxiety is 'nothingness/ and 'nothingness' is not an 'object.'" See Sigmund Freud, "Supple mentary Remarks on Anxiety/' Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety, 100, and Paul Tillich, "Existential Philosophy," Journal of the History of Ideas 5 (1944): 44, cited by Thomte in CA, xvi. Contemporary philosophers of affect have been similarly compelled to reassert this difference: Greimas and Fontanille, for example, write that "fear is real only in terms of a coming event, one that is in play here in terms of an object of knowledge that mobilizes expectations.. .[whereas] worry by defi nition has no precise object" (SP, 138), and for Annette Baier, having no thing as object is what distinguishes "mood" from "emotion" proper. See Annette Baier, "What Emotions Are About," Philosophical Perspectives 4 (1990): 3. 35 As many critics have noted, this is the same thesis Kierkegaard proposes in The Concept of Anxiety. See for instance Dam Magurshak, "The Concept of Anxiety: The Keystone of the Kierkegaard-Heidegger Relationship," International Kierkegaard Commentary, ed. Robert L. Perkins (Macon: Mercer University Press, 1985), 174, and Gordon D. Marino, "Anxiety in The Concept of Anxiety/' The Cambridge Com panion to Kierkegaard, ed. Alastair Hannay and Gordon D.

If one wants to read the novel as a sequence of generic shifts, Isabel as conventional Gothic figure (dark, nomadic, mysterious, a site of "unknown, foreign feminineness") appears to supplant neatly Lucy as classic heroine of the sentimental novel (blonde, bourgeois, virginal). Yet these roles seem to dissolve in the second half of the novel; the previously sublime Isabel becomes increasingly flattened into a caricature of a jealous wife, and Lucy seems to acquire a mystique ? "a brilliant, supernatural whiteness" and "inscru tableness" (328) of her own. 38 See Rachman for a more extensive analysis of this exhaustion vis-?-vis American neurasthenia, and "as an image in which disease and literary understanding con verge" (227). 39 Priscilla Wald, "Hearing Narrative Voices in Melville's Pierre," boundary 2 17.1 (1990): 100-132.
