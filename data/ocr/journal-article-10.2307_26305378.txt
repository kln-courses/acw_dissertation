<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILL KAUFMAN Mark Twain's Deformed Conscience Mark Twain fought a savage war against the human con science, and it broke out repeatedly in his public and private writings. In ajournai entry of August 1895 he argued that "in a crucial moral emergency a sound heart is a safer guide than an ill-trained conscience," and proposed to illustrate this "doctrine" through reference to "a book of mine in which a sound heart &amp; a deformed conscience come into collision &amp; conscience suffers defeat" (1895, 35). One of the most striking features in this book—Huckleberry Finn (1885)—is the destructive aggres sion with which the otherwise pacifistic Huck engages with his conscience: it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him. It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't no good, nohow. (302) Huck's battle against his persecutory conscience is widely discussed as a central, if not the central, conflict of the novel. Yet it is a theme to which Twain returns elsewhere with noteworthy frequency. Tom Sawyer's gang, playing pirates, settle down in a cave to sleep "the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary," only to be awakened the next morning by a sadistic "intruder": "It was conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came" (Twain 1876a, 92). Twain's Connecticut Yankee, Hank Morgan, flady declares: "If I had the remaking of man, he wouldn't have any conscience" (1889, 163). He would in fact pour upon the conscience the very same corrosive vitriol—or "pison"—as Huck Finn: American Imago, Vol. 63, No. 4, 465-478. © 2007 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 463</page><page sequence="2">464 Mark Twain's Deformed Conscience if I had an anvil in me would I prize it? Of course not. And yet when you come to think, there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil—I mean for comfort. I have noticed it a thousand times. And you could dis solve an anvil with acids, when you couldn't stand it any longer; but there isn't any way that you can work off a conscience—at least so it will stay worked off; not that I know of, anyway. (163-64) Other writings follow in the same vein. In the essay, "On the Decay of the Art of Lying" (1882a), Twain approvingly cites Fran cis Parkman's contempt for the "worries" of a "sick conscience" (n. p.), while his misanthropic, privately published dialogue, What Is Man? (1906), presents an Old Man instructing a Young Man on the insatiable workings of the "Master Passion," the Conscience—a "mysterious autocrat" indifferent to "anything but the satisfying of its own desires": It is a COLORLESS force seated in the man's moral con stitution. Let us call it an instinct—a blind, unreasoning instinct, which cannot and does not distinguish between good morals and bad ones, and cares nothing for results to the man provided its own contentment be secured; and it will ALWAYS secure that. (n. p.) Although he had no access to the terminology devised by Freud and his successors, it is apparent that Twain was groping towards a psychological definition of the conscience; hence his vague description of it as an "instinct." This assessment of course conflicts with his other depictions of the conscience as a wholly social formation, which accounts for his radical splitting of the psyche into a "sound heart" and an "ill-trained" or "deformed" conscience in Huckleberry Finn. Critics in the past have considered this splitting aspect of Twain's writing as a reflection of the split identity engendered by Samuel Clemens in 1863, when he first signed his revealing pseudonym beneath a comic travel letter in the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. "Mark Twain"—the cry of the Mississippi riverboat pilots measuring two fathoms—became what Clemens eventually called his "hated nom de plume" in an expression of resentment at the tyranny of his celebrated alter</page><page sequence="3">Will Kaufman 465 ego (Kaplan 1966, 133). Justin Kaplan's focus on this identity crisis is apparent in both the title and the content of his dual biography, Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain, and is shared by other literary critics (Cox 1966; Kaufman 1997) who have pointed to Clemens's recurrent preoccupation with twins and pairs throughout his career. Works such as Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, The Prince and the Pauper (1882b), and Pudd'nhead Wilson (1894) all foreground this preoccupation. Critical discussions of Twain's split identity have also been prompted by the guilt with which he is known to have viewed the comedic persona that came to define him. A wealth of bio graphical evidence indicates that Clemens's many moments of professional hubris were matched by public and private expres sions of shame and guilt over his role as a humorist, such as when referring to his wife Olivia in a letter to a confidante: "Poor girl, anybody who could convince her that I was not a humor ist would secure her eternal gratitude! She thinks a humorist is something pretty awful" (Wecter 1949, 63). As Clemens ex plained to William Dean Howells: "You see, the thing that gravels her is that I am so persistently glorified as a mere buffoon, as if that entirely covered my case—which she denies with venom" (Smith and Gibson 1960, 1:107). Clemens's oft-expressed fear of the slur, "buffoon," grows out of his early denigration of comedy—"exciting the laughter of God's creatures"—as "Poor, pitiful business" (Cox 1966, 3). Thus, the psychological "ordeal of Mark Twain," as Van Wyck Brooks called it (1920), was to some extent anchored in the mature professional decision taken by Samuel Clemens to forge a split personality. However, the internal conflict between what I have else where called "the social critic who demands to be taken seri ously and the comedian who cannot be" (Kaufman 1997, 40) only partially accounts for Mark Twain's repeated depiction of the conscience as a persecutory object. One of his most reveal ing short stories written for the Atlantic Monthly—'The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut" (1876b)—indicates that a more primitive conflict was at work. When read against the theories of Melanie Klein and others on both the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions, "Carnival of Crime" may be seen as a fictionalized adventure in paranoia and manic defense against a persecutory conscience.</page><page sequence="4">466 Mark Twain's Deformed Conscience Such an approach brings a new dimension to Twain criticism, which has thus far eluded the insights of Klein and the British object relations school. Freudians—beginning with Freud him self1—have long delved into the psychology of Twain's humor; yet in terms of his treatment of guilt and conscience, it is per haps more illuminating to turn to Klein rather than to Freud, for reasons explained by Roger Money-Kyrle: Those analysts who accept her results are quite as con cerned as those who have not yet done so with the exposure of the phantasies underlying the persecutory element in guilt... for in their view the super-ego, which Freud discovered, does not begin, as he believed, about the age of five, but is already at that age approaching its final form after five years of previous development. In its earlier stages, however, it consists of unintegrated phan tasy objects, by which the infant believes himself to be persecuted from within, and has not yet acquired its final character of an integrated internal mentor. (1955, 431) The narrator of "Carnival of Crime" is, to be sure, no infant; he is in fact a celebrated American man of letters transplanted from the South to a comfortable life in Connecticut—one of Clemens's many mock-autobiographies of the fictional construct, Mark Twain. However, as Money-Kyrle notes, a fundamental Kleinian tenet is the return of infantile "persecutory elements in [the] conscious and unconscious sense of guilt" in adults (431). The relevance of this and other Kleinian concepts to Twain's story is clearly established through a close reading, for the narrator displays all the paranoid-schizoid "hallmarks" as described by Klein (1959): "omnipotent destructive impulses, persecutory anxiety, and splitting" (253), as well as "idealization, denial and control of internal and external objects" (1952, 70). However, as I shall argue, "Mark Twain" is not stuck purely in the paranoid-schizoid position, for he also displays the capacity for guilt and remorse that Klein associates with the depressive position. It is in his retreat from that guilt that he lapses into the paranoid-schizoid behavior associated with manic defense, and ultimately realizes the psychotic fantasy that concludes the story: the utter destruction of his conscience.</page><page sequence="5">Will Kaufman 467 "Carnival of Crime" begins with Twain awaiting a visit from his beloved Aunt Mary, only to be surprised by an uninvited guest who—as it transpires—is an anthropomorphic projection of his persecutory conscience: Straightway the door opened, and a shrivelled, shabby dwarf entered. He was not more than two feet high. He seemed to be about forty years old. Every feather and inch of him was a trifle out of shape; and so, while one could not put his finger upon any particular part and say, "This is a conspicuous deformity," the spectator perceived that this little person was a deformity as a whole—a vague, general, evenly-blended, nicely-adjusted deformity. (Ill) With the "deformity" of the intruder established at the outset, Twain proceeds to outline the twinship between the dwarf and himself in highly contemptuous terms: There was a fox-like cunning in the face and the sharp little eyes, and also alertness and malice. And yet, this vile bit of human rubbish seemed to bear a sort of remote and ill-defined resemblance to me! It was dully perceptible in the mean form, the countenance, and even the clothes, gestures, manner, and attitudes of the creature. He was a far-fetched, dim suggestion of a burlesque upon me, a caricature of me in little. One thing about him struck me forcibly, and most unpleasantly; he was covered all over with a fuzzy, greenish mold, such as one sometimes sees upon mildewed bread. The sight of it was nauseat ing. (Ill) It is significant that Conscience is presented here as an intruding external force—a characterization that Clemens applies in other notable works such as 'The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg" (1900) and The Mysterious Stranger (written 1898, published 1916), which depict Satanic figures in both the instructive and destructive modes of a persecutory superego. As Lavinia Gomez (1997) explains, a "hallmark of the paranoid-schizoid position" is the "central fear . .. that we will be destroyed by a malevolent external force" (37).</page><page sequence="6">468 Mark Twain's Deformed Conscience By presenting the deformed intruder as a doppelgänger of Mark Twain, Clemens projects into his public persona the hate ful, persecutory and terrifying aspects of the superego. He does this first through reference to a number of the visible trademarks of the Mark Twain image. Firstly, Twain was one of the world's most publicly devoted smokers (at the height of his fame, he endorsed John Player tobacco among many other products). Thus, in "Carnival of Crime," Conscience initially seizes upon this aspect to establish his control over the narrator: He picked up my old chalk pipe from the floor, gave the stem a wipe or two on his knee, filled the bowl from the tobacco-box at his side, and said to me in a tone of pert command,— "Gimme a match!" I blushed to the roots of my hair; partly with indigna tion, but mainly because it somehow seemed to me that this whole performance was very like an exaggeration of conduct which I myself had sometimes been guilty of in my intercourse with familiar friends;—but never, never with strangers, I observed to myself. (Ill) That such control is both hateful and inescapable Twain makes clear: "I wanted to kick the pygmy into the fire, but some in comprehensible sense of being legally and legitimately under his authority forced me to obey his order" (112). Conscience then consolidates his hold on one further Twainian trademark: the celebrated Missouri drawl through which America's most popular humorist projected his identity in lecture halls around the world, as well as in print. In corrupting Twain's voice through parody, the persecutor thus seizes ownership of the aural as well as the physical lineaments of the narrator: He applied the match to the pipe, took a contemplative whiff or two, and remarked, in an irritatingly familiar way,— "Seems to me it's devilish odd weather for this time of year." I flushed again, and in anger and humiliation as before; for the language was hardly an exaggeration of</page><page sequence="7">Will Kaufman 469 some that I have uttered in my day, and moreover was delivered in a tone of voice and with an exasperating drawl that had the seeming of a deliberate travesty of my style. Now there is nothing I am quite so sensitive about as a mocking imitation of my drawling infirmity of speech. (112) Having thus established its authority, the intruding projec tion launches into full-blown persecutory mode, tormenting the narrator with recollections of past injuries towards others: a hungry tramp turned away from his door, a novice author sent away with her manuscript unread, a trusting younger brother whom he had bullied. In denial, the guilty narrator offers a se ries of rationalizations through which he attempts to implicate Conscience as the wrongdoer. One passage deserves quotation at length, as it indicates the achievement of guilt and remorse associated with the depressive position, as well as examples of manic or mock reparation in retreat from that position. As Twain accuses Conscience: "In your anxiety to get all the juice you can out of a sin, you make a man repent of it in three or four different ways. For instance, you found fault with me for lying to that tramp, and I suffered over that. But it was only yes terday that I told a tramp the square truth, to wit, that, it being regarded as bad citizenship to encourage vagrancy, I would give him nothing. What did you do then? Why, you made me say to myself, 'Ah, it would have been so much kinder and more blameless to ease him off with a little white lie, and send him away feeling that if he could not have bread, the gentle treatment was at least some thing to be grateful for!' Well, I suffered all day about that. Three days before, I had fed a tramp, and fed him freely, supposing it a virtuous act. Straight off you said, 'O false citizen, to have fed a tramp!' and I suffered as usual. I gave a tramp work; you objected to it,—after the contract was made, of course; you never speak up before hand. Next, I refused a tramp work; you objected to that. Next, I proposed to kill a tramp; you kept me awake all night, oozing remorse at every pore. Sure I was going</page><page sequence="8">470 Mark Twain's Deformed Conscience to be right this time, I sent the next tramp away with my benediction; and I wish you may live as long as I do, if you did n't make me smart all night again because I did n't kill him." (119-20) As Hanna Segal (1973) maintains, "the underlying guilt which manic reparation seeks to alleviate is, in fact, not relieved, and the reparation brings no lasting satisfaction" (96). The narrator's litany of supposed reparatory acts against his bête noir, the tramp, bears out Segal's point. The final proposed act—the killing of the tramp—illustrates that, at bottom, Twain is motivated by the "triad of feelings" that characterizes manic reparation: "control, triumph and contempt" for the object of reparation (83). Klein (1940) contends that while one's repara tive efforts "may be of a highly constructive nature ... the implicit triumph and the ensuing harm and injury done to the object may outweigh these purposes" (352). The trajectory of Twain's proposed manic reparations, from the high point of feeding to the low point of killing, indicates that he is more concerned with the reaction of his superego than with the fate of the tramp, who is merely a pawn in his battle against Conscience. That Twain finds the superego an indiscriminate persecu tor is made clear in his admission, "I never did a thing in all my life, virtuous or otherwise, that I did n't repent of within twenty-four hours" (120). Conscience confirms this: "I don't care what act you may turn your hand to, I can straightway whisper a word in your ear and make you think you have committed a dreadful meanness. It is my business—and my joy—to make you repent of everything you do" (120). Yet, as the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that one other party is an equal target of the narrator's hostility, indicating a complex projection of internal bad objects: the story's only mother figure, Twain's Aunt Mary. As it transpires, she and the persecutory Conscience are inextricably linked through Twain's projection. The dwarf s arrival, it will be recalled, is triggered by the approach of Aunt Mary, who is from the outset an object of severe splitting. On the one hand, she is idealized as a good mother figure; hence the narrator's fond description upon receiving a letter from her:</page><page sequence="9">Will Kaufman 471 The first superscription I glanced at was in a handwriting that sent a thrill of pleasure through and through me. It was aunt Mary's; and she was the person I loved and hon ored most in all the world, outside of my own household. She had been my boyhood's idol; maturity, which is fatal to so many enchantments, had not been able to dislodge her from her pedestal; no, it had only justified her right to be there, and placed her dethronement permanently among the impossibilities. (110) As Klein (1963) notes, however, the paranoid-schizoid position includes "a splitting of the mother figure into a very bad part and an idealized good one" (277). Gomez (1997) points to a common literary reflection of this split: The wicked witch and the fairy godmother of fairy-tales are the good and bad aspects of mother as she is thus perceived and divided" (37). In Twain's story, the '"wicked witch" becomes the deformed dwarf, while his linkage with "the fairy godmother"—the idealized Aunt Mary—indicates that he is an external projection of the persecu tory aspects of this split mother-figure residing in the superego. The two figures act in concert as a persecutory pair. This linkage of Aunt Mary and the dwarf is foreshadowed by the narrator's early reference to her as both comforter and frustrating mother-figure: 'To show how strong her influence over me was, I will observe that long after everybody else's 'do stop-smoking ' had ceased to affect me in the slightest degree, aunt Mary could still stir my torpid conscience into faint signs of life when she touched upon the matter" (110). The story in fact opens with the narrator already in denial and in retreat from the stirrings of that "torpid conscience" under his aunt's influence. As he explains: A happy day came at last, when even aunt Mary's words could no longer move me. ... Of course she pleaded with me just as earnestly as ever, after that blessed day, to quit my pernicious habit, but to no purpose whatever; the moment she opened the subject I at once became calmly, peacefully, contentedly indifferent—absolutely, adamantinely indifferent I could not have enjoyed my pet vice more if my gentle tormentor had been a smoker herself, and an advocate of the practice. (110)</page><page sequence="10">472 Mark Twain's Deformed Conscience The narrator's apparent guiltlessness—his ostensible imper viousness to the moral pressure from his aunt or, by extension, his superego—accounts for the untroubled mood with which he affects to open his story: "I was feeling blithe, almost jocund" (110). Yet the intruding dwarfs self-revelation soon exposes the narrator's denial, triggering a lapse into the infantile ter ror and violence that Klein (1933) associates with the child's earliest perception of the superego—"the man-eating wolf, the fire-spewing dragon, and all the evil monsters out of myths and fairy-stories" that terrorize the child with a "fear of being de voured, or cut up, or torn to pieces"—a perception, in fact, of "the child's own parents . . . created out of imaginary pictures or imagos of them which it has taken into itself' (249). As Klein notes, this perception marks the first step in a spiral of paranoid-schizoid behavior—a spiral that actually serves as the plot of Twain's "Carnival of Crime": Since the first imagos [a child] forms are endowed with all the attributes of the intense sadism belonging to this stage of its development, and since they will once more be projected on to objects of the outer world, the small child becomes dominated by the fear of suffering unimagi nable cruel attacks, both from its real objects and from its superego. Its anxiety will serve to increase its own sadistic impulses by urging it to destroy those hostile objects so as to escape their onslaughts. (1933, 251) When the deformed intruder from "the outer world" reveals himself to the narrator—"Well, I am your Conscience"—Twain's sadistic response is fully in keeping with Klein's proposition, in particular with regard to the "anal sadism" with which the paranoid infant expels in one great "fecal mass" a barrage of "weapons and missiles" (1930, 219-20): I sprang at the creature, roaring,— "Curse you, I have wished a hundred million times that you were tangible, and that I could get my hands on your throat once! Oh, but I will wreak a deadly vengeance on"— Folly! Lightning does not move more quickly than my Conscience did! He darted aloft so suddenly that in</page><page sequence="11">Will Kaufman 473 the moment my fingers clutched the empty air he was already perched on the top of the high book-case, with his thumb at his nose in token of derision. I flung the poker at him, and missed. I fired the bootjack. In a blind rage I flew from place to place, and snatched and hurled any missile that came handy; the storm of books, inkstands, and chunks of coal gloomed the air and beat about the manikin's perch relentlessly, but all to no purpose; the nimble figure dodged every shot; and not only that, but burst into a cackle of sarcastic and triumphant laughter as I sat down exhausted. (115-16) The physical lightness of Twain's conscience is at this point paradoxical unless it is meant to indicate that his guiltlessness is indeed a manic defense mechanism and an attempted retreat from the sufferings of the depressive position. After all, Twain has already confessed to being tormented by remorse at the hands of Conscience. This too is confirmed by the dwarf, who explains: "You had a large conscience once; if you've a small con science now, I reckon there are reasons for it. . . . You see, you used to be conscientious about a great many things; morbidly so, I may say. It was a great many years ago. You probably do not remember it, now. Well, I took a great interest in my work, and I so enjoyed the anguish which certain pet sins of yours afflicted you with, that I kept pelting at you until I rather overdid the matter. You began to rebel. Of course I began to lose ground, then, and shrivel a little,—diminish in stature, get moldy, and grow deformed." (121-22) The lightness of Conscience suggests that Twain's guiltless ness only partially succeeds as a defense mechanism against the persecutions of the superego, since it is his very guiltlessness that allows Conscience to escape annihilation by the murder ous Twain. Conscience sneers from atop his perch: "Fool, I should have weighed a ton, and could not have budged from the floor; but instead, you are so cheerfully anxious to kill me that your conscience is as light as a feather; hence, I am away up here out of your reach" (116). Thus, in a psychologi cal double-bind, Twain's guiltlessness only serves to entrench</page><page sequence="12">474 Mark Twain's Deformed Conscience further the persecutory dominance of his Conscience, as he is forced to conclude: I would have given anything, then, to be heavy-hearted, so that I could get this person down from there and take his life, but I could no more be heavy-hearted over such a desire than I could have sorrowed over its accomplish ment. So I could only look longingly up at my master, and rave at the ill-luck that denied me a heavy conscience the one only time that I had ever wanted such a thing in my life. (116) The eventual arrival of Twain's Aunt Mary marks a new stage in the psychic disintegration implied by the story: the narrator's descent into full psychosis through the destruction of his conscience, with which the bad mother-figure is securely twinned. "I am going to abuse you a litde now," she tells him upon her arrival, resuming her persecutory role as a projec tion of the merciless superego. She admonishes Twain for his neglect of "the poor family around the corner," to which he confesses: "In simple truth, I never had thought of that family a second time! And now such a splintering pang of guilt shot through me! I glared up at my Conscience. Plainly, my heavy heart was affecting him. His body was drooping forward; he seemed about to fall from the book-case" (124). With every subsequent accusation of Aunt Mary's, the elusive dwarf grows heavier and heavier: "[M]y Conscience could no longer bear up under the weight of my sufferings, but tumbled headlong from his high perch and struck the floor with a dull, leaden thump" (124-25). At this moment, the mature, urbane Twain once again becomes the paranoid-schizoid infant observed by Klein—violent, destructive, spoiling, rending and tearing: With an exultant shout I sprang past my aunt, and in an instant I had my life-long foe by the throat. After so many years of waiting and longing, he was mine at last. I tore him to shreds and fragments. I rent the fragments to bits. I cast the bleeding rubbish into the fire, and drew into my nostrils the grateful incense of my burnt-offering. At last, and forever, my Conscience was dead! (126)</page><page sequence="13">Will Kaufman 475 If there is any remaining doubt over the twinship between the deformed, persecutory Conscience and Aunt Mary as the per secuting bad mother, it is wholly removed with her expulsion, coterminous with the destruction of the dwarf: I was a free man! I turned upon my poor aunt, who was almost petrified with terror, and shouted,— "Out of this with your paupers, your charities, your reforms, your pestilent morals! You behold before you a man whose life-conflict is done, whose soul is at peace; a man whose heart is dead to sorrow, dead to suffering, dead to remorse; a man WITHOUT A CONSCIENCE! In my joy I spare you, though I could throttle you and never feel a pang! Fly!" (126) Aunt Mary's eviction—as opposed to her destruction or elimination—inaugurates the narrator's actual "Carnival of Crime," just as it was the promise of her return that had foreshadowed it. In this sense, she is confirmed as the bad part-object—the frustrating mother—driving the persecutory conscience that Klein (1933) maintains "is at the bottom of asocial and criminal tendencies in the individual.... [I] t is the excessive severity and overpowering cruelty of the superego, not the weakness or want of it, as is usually supposed, which is responsible for the behavior of asocial and criminal persons" (251). The catalogue of psychotic behavior that closes the story can be read in light of Ronald Fairbairn's views (1943) on the connections between such behavior and the "return of bad objects"—in this case, the persecuting bad mother: [The] development of psychopathological symptoms is determined by a return of bad objects which have been repressed. ... As such, the return of bad objects obvi ously implies a failure of the defence of repression: but it equally implies a failure of the moral defence and a collapse of the authority of the superego. (125) It is precisely this "collapse" that closes Mark Twain's story—a collapse signaled by the annihilation of the deformed conscience</page><page sequence="14">476 Mark Twain's Deformed Conscience and the exit of the persecuting bad mother. However, it is of crucial importance that Aunt Mary is not annihilated, but is rather spared, repressed in order to continue her activity in the narrator's unconscious, perpetuating the "vicious circle" that Klein describes between the persecutory anxiety and the destructive impulses of the paranoid-schizoid. The narrator boasts: She fled. Since that day my life is all bliss. Bliss, unalloyed bliss. Nothing in all the world could persuade me to have a conscience again. I settled all my old outstanding scores, and began the world anew. I killed thirty-eight persons during the first two weeks—all of them on account of ancient grudges. I burned a dwelling that interrupted my view. I swindled a widow and some orphans out of their last cow, which is a very good one, though not thorough bred, I believe. I have also committed scores of crimes, of various kinds, and have enjoyed my work exceedingly, whereas it would formerly have broken my heart and turned my hair gray, I have no doubt. (126) Given that this marks the end of Twain's story, it is in psy chological terms an exceedingly grim outcome, however much it succeeds as comedy. Discontinuing the tale of the narrator's psychic development at this point imprisons him in a spiral of infantile psychosis and extreme disintegration, which both derives from and perpetuates his inability to "deal satisfactorily with these conflicting feelings—love, hatred and guilt," as de scribed by Klein (1936, 293). The narrator concludes, "by way of advertisement, that medical colleges desiring assorted tramps for scientific purposes, either by the gross, by cord measurement, or per ton, will do well to examine the lot in my cellar before purchasing elsewhere" (126). Thus, having secured his triumph over the object of his contempt—the tramp—Twain punctuates the destruction of his Conscience, who had used the tramp as an instrument of persecution. The victorious, psychotic narrator must now await the invention of psychotherapy. Following the publication of this story, Samuel Clemens enjoyed another thirty-four years of sharpening and plying what he called his "pen warmed up in hell" (Smith and Gibson</page><page sequence="15">Will Kaufman 477 1960,2:613). The capacity for such critical aggression, of course, can be considered an "achievement," as Donald Winnicott makes clear: "Aggressive ideas and behavior take on a positive value, and hate becomes a sign of civilization, when we keep in mind the whole process of the emotional development of the individual" (1964, 239). Klein—of whom Winnicott claims that she "took up the destructiveness that is in human nature and started to make sense of it in psychoanalytic terms" (1960, 80)—might see Twain's sublimated aggression and hatred in the positive light reserved for those satirists who "hate people and things which are felt to be worthy of hate" (Klein 1937, 312n). Yet, as Clemens confessed in a letter to Howells: "I don't ever seem to be in a good enough humor with ANYthing to satirize it; no, I want to stand up before it and curse it, and foam at the mouth—or take a club and pound it to rags and pulp" (Smith and Gibson 1960, 1:248-49). In the face of such naked rage, perhaps a psychotherapist—rather than a biographer or literary critic—would be better placed to determine how Mark Twain's Conscience could fall victim to the same violence that he so memorably visited upon slavery and racism, American impe rialism, European colonialism, Calvinist Presbyterianism, and other achievements of what he called (1905-09) "the damned human race."

Freud (1905) discusses the "humorous pleasure" aroused by Twain's "economy of pity" and "economy of the feelings of piety"—at which, he confesses, "we cannot help laughing" (230).
