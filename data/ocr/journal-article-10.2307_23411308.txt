<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Malaitan War Clubs" By David Akin. Malaitan war clubs are a common item in Pacific collections, but many museums have little information about them.* I recently saw one in a major museum labeled "Australian canoc paddle". This paper describes five different types of clubs found in the East Kwaio area, behind Sinalagu Harbor. All of the clubs are found in other parts of Malaita as well. Kwaio clubs, or gi'a ('Are'are si'a) are usually made of tooa, a reddish hardwood. There are three different types of tooa: tooafou, which is preferred; tooa'abu, which has dark streaks in the grain, and tooa'agou, which is lighter and cracks easily.^ Other types of wood are sometimes used, especially laru (ironwood, Casuarina equisetifolia) which has been imported from New Georgia since early in the labour trade. Most finished clubs are submerged in mud (saltwater or fresh) for about a month, during which time they acquire a glossy black finish.

Occasionally clubs are made red by rubbing them with the red leaves of a plant called laalangobasi. Clubs are polished with the leaves of a plant called totouto. Club handles, especially subi and morimori, are often wrapped in cord of twisted fibre. This is usually pandanus or the stringy fiber of coconut husks. These fibers are sometimes dyed black with the sap of the laalao tree (wild banana). Incised designs are filled with white lime or the ground powder from a white stone called foulafu. This is temporary and done before social gather ings. Kwaio clubs are not inlayed with mother of pearl. Afui or basibasi may be decorated with a cane band dyed red with geru (Morinda citrifolia) root. Subi ('Are'are supi, N. Malaita subi, figures 5 and 6) and afui are the most common Malaitan clubs. A subi is now part of the seal of the Provincial Government of Malaita. Subi are named by more than a dozen euphemisms in Kwaio. They were the favored weapons for raiding villages as they could be placed over the head as a shield when ducking through small Kwaio doorways. Blows were struck with the points (du'udu'una) of the club. There are several different shapes of subi and great variation in size. Some are as short as two feet, and a reliable informant, when young, saw one consecrated to ancestors that was over five feet long. Most subi have two raised ridges forming a cross in the center of the diamond head. These are called suri'iuu, literally 'lamphrey spine'. A few have only one or no ridge. Some subi have incised designs. The entire handle (kaaka'ina) is wrapped in cord. The carved hook at the base, or la'ona, prevents the weapon from being pulled from the holder's grasp. Some subi have a row of cone shell rings called tale'esirikuma tied to the top of the binding with fish or bird netting. These rings may have represented secret killings to the owner's credit. Kwaio men are forbidden from carrying subi to the strictly regulated courtship rendezvous because of its sexual symbolism. The first subi was supposedly made by a man using his sister's clitoris as a model. This symbolism is also recognized in North Malaita. Afui or alafolo ('Are'are ahui, N. Malaita afui or 'alafolo, see figures 9 and 10) are anthropomorphic clubs found everywhere on Malaita. Blows are struck with the edges of the club, not the 'noses' or 'ako'akona. Size ranges from under three feet to over four feet in length. There are different designs for the 'eyes' of the afui, the most common being laa'engari (figures 1 and 2) and toonilai (figure 3). The 'ako'akona are often incised. Some afui have a design representing a butterfly pro boscis on the handle. The carved base of the handle (googou) may be incised also. A few afui have binding on the tapered grip (kiokiona). Rarely, afui will have a woven ring of porpoise teeth (Kwaio kwaloi'a, 'Are'are waroi'a) hung from the 'ako'akona. A hole may be drilled on either side of the 'nose' in which are inserted 'ama'ama leaves (lycopodium fern). Both kwaloi'a and 'ama'ama are used for protection against sorcery. Morimori (figure 8) are valued for their adaptability as both an offensive and defensive weapon. Except for binding above the grip they are not decorated. Morimori are euphemistically referred to as botagaufolo or 'smash house walls'. ~~ Basibasi (figure 7) are not common. There is only one in the Sinalagu area now, but there were more before. The one that remains is consecrated to ancestors, and was taken from sea people in Uru Harbor, to the north of Sinalagu, during an argument. The club resembles those from Santa Isabel and I suspect it originates from there. Many other items such as spears, pendants, and armrings were directly and indirectly traded to Kwaio from Isabel in the past. The basibasi pictured here is over 90 cm. long. Kila (figure 4) is another type of club of which there are few in Kwaio.</page><page sequence="4">17 Some people also call this club basibasi. One is supposed to have been used as a walking stick by a powerful ancestress over ten generations ago. Kila are more common in North Malaita and may also have originated in Isabel. In the North the handles are plaited with orchid vine and geru dyed palm strips. The club pictured is 110 cm. long. The Kwaio tell of another type of club called fou-late'emaa, with a heavy stone bound to the top, but none are here now. All of these types of clubs were carried by men, but oral tradition has it that a type of club called sinabe, similar to a kila, were carried by women in the past for protection. The Kwaio still make and carry afui, subi, and morimori, although violence is a rarity. Notes 1. The Kwaio Cultural Centre would like to thank the Chicago Field Museum, the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, the Solomon Islands National Museum, and the Museum of Mankind for making their collections, or photos, available for study. 2. Anyone who feels they may be able to identify this or other unidentified plants in this paper from samples, please contact the author at Kwaio Cultural Centre, Sinalagu, East Kwaio, Malaita. Any other information about, or photos of the clubs would be much appreciated.</page></plain_text>
