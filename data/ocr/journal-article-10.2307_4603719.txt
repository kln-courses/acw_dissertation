<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUCRETIUS AND THE EPICUREANS IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT OF RENAISSANCE FLORENCE ALISON BROWN he story of the recovery of Lucretius in the fifteenth century is familiar and can be briefly told. After a short Carolingian renaissance, Lucretius apparently "went underground" for about five hundred years before being unearthed by Poggio Bracciolini in 1417.1 Poggio gave the manuscript he had discovered in Germany to his friend Niccolo Niccoli to copy. Then there is silence again for more than a decade, broken only by the voice of Poggio asking Nic- coli with increasing urgency to return his Lucretius: "You have al- ready kept Lucretius for twelve years", he wrote to him in 1429, re- peating in the following year: "I want to read Lucretius [...] surely you don't want to keep him for another ten years?"2 Perhaps Poggio's This paper originated as my Inaugural Lecture at Royal Holloway, University of Lon- don, and I would like to acknowledge here my debt both to London University, my alma mater, and to Villa I Tatti for nourishing and supporting my work over many years. Among the many friends who have helped and advised me in preparing it for publication, I would particularly like to thank David Marsh, John Najemy and Jonathan Nelson, as well as Caroline Elam, Bill Kent and David Quint, to all of whom I am indebted for their valuable sug- gestions. 1 See L.

Yet after the middle of the century, to judge from the fifty or so extant manuscripts and the repeated printed editions of De re- rum natura, the poem was being read by increasing numbers of peo- ple.3 In Florence nine manuscripts survive in the Medici library alone while in Rome and Naples interest in Lucretius is associated with the academies of Pomponio Leto, Antonio Panormita and Giovanni Pontano.4 It seemed that the text would never again be at risk. Yet it remained a risky text. In 1517, exactly one hundred years after Poggio re-discovered De rerum natura, Lucretius was prohibited as "reading in our schools" by the Florentine synod, because it was "a lascivious and wicked work, in which every effort is used to demonstrate the mortality of the soul".5 pio legere Lucretium [...] nunquid etiam ilium decennium tenere velis?"). His appeals for the return of Lucretius began in 1425, see pp. 144 (no. 51, 12 May 1425), 149 (no. 53, 14 June 1425), 172 (no. 65, 14 Sept. 1426), 142 (no. 50, 14 Apr.1427: "Rogo te, mittas mihi Lucretium") and 187 (no. 73, 17 May 1427). 3 For example, in Florence Sigismondo della Stufa, Ufficiale dello Studio 1485- 1486, owned a Lucretius (ASF Ufficio de' Pupilli 179, 366r, the reference to which I owe to Jonathan Davies). REEVE, Ioc. cit. (see note 1), pp. 27-28, lists 51 mostly fif- teenth-century manuscripts (plus two printed editions), to which should now be added Berlin Lat.2? 544 and Madrid Nac. 2885. First printed in Brescia in ca. 1473, there were at least three further editions in Venice and Verona before the Giuntine Florentine edi- tion of 1512, C. GORDON, A Bibliography of Lucretius, London, 1962 (listed on pp. 29- 44). Identified readers listed by Reeve are Poggio, Niccoli, Pontano, Pomponio Leto, Poliziano, Machiavelli and Marullo, also Filelfo, Panormita, Guarino and Valia, pp. 27 and note 10 on 42-43. 4 One of the MSS. in the Biblioteca Laurenziana (35, 30) is Niccoli's copy of Poggio's original; another belonged to and is annotated by Angelo Poliziano (35, 29), and another (35, 28) belonged to Francesco Sassetti, copied by Bartolomeo Fonzio in the 1470s, see A.

(see note 1), p. 352: "opera lasciva et impia, quale est Lucretii poema, ubi animae mortalitatem totis viribus ostendere nititur". Although the Commissary General of the Inquisition, Michele Ghislieri, included Lucretius and Lucian among the many pagan books to be read as fables and not taken seriously, like Ariosto's Orlando or the Cento novelle, Lucretius (who, unlike Lucian, was not listed by name in the Roman In- dex of that year), would have been included generically in the prohibition against "Libri omnes quicunque a catholicis episcopis vel universitatibus vel inquisitoribus [...] in diocesibus 12</page><page sequence="3">LUCRETIUS AND THE EPICUREANS So we are presented with an enigma, a text that multiplied more than fifty-fold in the course of the fifteenth century and yet whose readers and motives for reading Lucretius remain largely unknown. The popularity of the text seems confirmed by the need to prohibit it from being read in school, but thanks to the danger that it pre- sented, it is as difficult to discover how Lucretius was read as it is to discover who read him. Because he was a pupil of Epicurus, whom he extols in his poem as "our father, the discoverer of truths", a god", "an oracle, whose glory is now exalted to the skies",6 he was tainted with Epicurus's posthumous reputation for hedonism and materialism - a reputation that Epicurus retained throughout the Middle Ages, despite a few countervailing voices intent on keep- ing his historical persona alive.7 In view of Epicurus's beliefs about the world and man - uncaring gods, multiple worlds created not by design but by the chance clash of atoms within empty space, the hu- man mind and spirit co-terminous with the body and dying with it - he threatened the entire structure of the Christian universe and its underpinning, belief in providence and an after-life that rewarded the good and punished the bad.8 It is not surprising, then, that in The Divine Comedy we find the Epicureans buried apart from the other heretics, since they alone believe "that man's soul, when his [...] prohibiti fuerint", Index des livres interdits, ed. J. M. DE BUJANDA, VIII, Geneva, 1990, no. 00147, pp. 32, 245. 6 LUCRETIUS III, 1-30 at 9: "tu pater es, rerum inventor'; V, 8-10: "deus ille fuit, deus"; VI, 5-8: "virum [...] omnia veridico qui quondam ex ore profudit; cuius [...] ad caelum gloria fertur"; cf. I, 62-79. 7 E.g. Seneca and even the critical Cicero, whose dialogues in utramque partem always present his arguments before refuting them.

Initially he was discussed in humanist debates about virtue and the ancient philosophical sects, for example in Leonardo Bruni's Isagogicon (1424-1426), and shortly afterwards in writings like Cosma Raimondi's "robustly hedonistic" Defence of Epicurus (ca. 1429) and Lorenzo Valla's better-known treatise On pleasure (De voluptate), the first version of which was completed two years later.10 Another new source recovered at this time was Diogenes Laertius's biography of Epicurus in his Lives of Eminent Philosophers, which was brought from Constantinople in 1416 and translated by the monk Ambrogio Traversari for Cosimo de' Medici in the 1420s and early 1430s."1 Since this was exactly the moment when Poggio was clamouring for the return of his Lucretius from Niccolo Niccoli, it is tempting to see the late 1420s as a tournant in attitudes to Epicurus and Lucretius, the beginnings of "radical naturalism" and the "new vision of the world" that traditionally marks the Renaissance period: new ideas introduced by the recovery of ancient texts.12 For despite Traversari's painstaking attempt to 9 DANTE, Divine Comedy, X, 1-15: "da questa parte hanno / con Epicuro tutti i suoi seguaci, / che I'anima col corpo morta fanno"; LANDINO, Commentary, Florence, Niccol6 di Lorenzo, 1481, fol. g6r: "Imperoche chi pone l'anima mortale togle ogni fondamento al giu- sto vivere civile et alla vera religione". 10 M.

Thus Poggio Bracciolini, who worked in the papal curia as an apostolic writer, was careful to warn Panormita, after reading his Hermaphroditus, that "the same licence, you know, is not given to us Christians as was given to novatore", "una posizione di radicale naturalismo", "la nuova visione del mondo" (75, 77, 85-86). 13 According to PAGNONI, Ioc. cit. (see note 7), p. 1457, this "nuovo e rivoluzionario documento", as well as influencing Valia, also explains "la ancor piu solida ricostituzione dell'Epicuro storico in Filippo Buonaccorsi e Paolo Giustiniani"; and on CUSANO, ibid., p. 1459, note 73; cf.

Although Ficino enjoyed a burst of hedonism in his twenties when he wrote a commentary on Lucretius as well as a treatise On pleasure, it is now said that even as a young man he was always a Christian, well before becoming a priest and a dedicated Platonist in the 1470s. Subsequently, he at- tacked Lucretius's ideas whereever they conflicted with his own be- liefs, disowning to Poliziano the "Aristippean and partly Lucretian rather than Platonic" letters which were circulating in his name, and declaring in 1492 that he had burnt his youthful Lucretian com- mentary.'8 And thanks to Ficino's instruction, Poliziano, too, re- 16 See E.

Traversari's scruples about translating Diogenes Laertius and his means of resolving them are discussed by GIGANTE, Ioc. cit. (see note 13). 17 J am indebted to John Najemy for suggesting to me Lucretius's influence on Alber- ti's view of love, first discussed in a paper given at the Annual Meeting of the Renaissance Society of America in Florence, 2000. Other common themes are an interest in nature and animals, the nature of the gods, man's weak beginnings and the origins of cities; but with the exception of one citation from Lucretius about old age (III, 451-454, in Italian in Theo- gonius, Opere volgari, ed. C. GRAYSON, Bari, 1966, II, p. 101) and the comparisons cited by Najemy, Alberti's epicureanism seems to derive more obviously from Diogenes Laertius than from De rerum natura (see, e.g., note 38 below). However see now S. GAMBINO, "Al- berti Lettore di Lucrezio. Motivi lucreziani nel Theogonius", Albertiana, 4, 2001, pp. 69-84, the reference to which I owe to Luca Boschetto.

After Antonio Panormita took his copy of Poggio's manuscript there, Naples became the centre of another net- work of Lucretian scholars. One was Lorenzo Bonincontri, a Tuscan who joined Panormita's academy in Naples after being exiled from Florence and wrote a scientific poem De rebus naturalibus et divi- nis. Another was Giovanni Pontano, a royal secretary and successor to Panormita as head of the academy, whose more famous scientific poem Urania was read by the Florentine humanist Pietro Crinito during his stay in Naples in 1495-1496. And a third was Michele Marullo, author of Lucretian Hymni naturales, who also joined the academy in Naples - and, briefly, the Roman academy of Pomponio R. MARCEL, Theologie platonicienne, Paris, 1964), see his "Obiectio Lucretii et responsio. Quod mens potest absque corpore operari" and "Obiectio Epicuri et responsio.

Cristoforo Landino, too, though not a cleric, also condemned Epicureanism because of his Platonic standpoint in the Disputationes Camaldulenses, as he explains in his Commentary on Dante, (see note 9, fols. g5v-g6r). 19 See I.

As this paper was going to press, Salvatore Camporeale kindly lent me a very recent publication, Rapporti e scambi tra umanesimo italiano ed umanesimo europeo (L.

BOCCUTO, "Riprese Lucre- ziane nel Marullo e nel Poliziano" (pp. 705-716), the latter usefully analysing Lucretian in- fluences in Poliziano's Nutricia and in Marullo's Hymni, with the conclusion that while in Poliziano they have "un valore prevalentemente, se non esclusivamente, letterario", in Ma- rulo "superano l'ambito formale per acquistare importanza decisiva a livello di contenuto e di posizioni di pensiero" (p. 716). 2 17</page><page sequence="8">ALISON BROWN Leto, owner of another manuscript of De rerum natura - before going to Florence in 1489. According to Goddard, however, all these writings equally exploited Epicureanism "by recalling Lucretius and then by deliberately rejecting Epicurean arguments to reinforce their own Christian positions".20 If we rely on the textual route to understanding Lucretius in the fifteenth century, we evidently have to agree that his influence was minimal, restricted to a group of scholars who liked the medium of his poetry but not his message.2' But was this really how the fif- teenth century responded to the bold and imaginative Lucretius, who wrote so movingly about love, mental fear (terror animi) and that "hidden power" (vis abdita quaedam) that grinds down human- ity? 22 Nothing illustrates the problem of interpreting Lucretius 20 GODDARD, op. cit.

While Aby Warburg more than a century ago acknowledged Lucretius, as well as Poliziano, as among the sources of this celebration of nature and the power of love, Ernst Gombrich in the mid 1940s told us in- stead that the painting had the sober pedagogical purpose of in- structing the young Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici in the mor- al virtues.23 Within the last decade, however, a series of writers (en- couraged by a new inventory and re-dating of the painting) have re- acknowledged De rerum natura as one of its sources, with its descrip- tion of "Spring and Venus, and Venus's winged harbinger marching before, with Zephyr and mother Flora a pace behind him strewing the whole path in front with brilliant colours and scents" - and what more appropriate theme for a wedding gift (if, as it has more recently been suggested, it was related to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's marriage to Semiramide d'Appiano in 1482) than Lucretius's opening lines celebrating Spring, with Zephyr and "Sweet Venus" striking "Into all hearts [...] your lure of love".24 These re-interpretations de- pended heavily on the discovery of new documentary records, letters and inventories, as well as on changing historical fashions.

Lucretius contains many "clusters of ideas" that would have had resonance at the time, especially his central concern with death and the fear instilled by re- ligion about the afterlife, the force and dangers of love, the role of chance in the creation of the world, man's evolution and his chang- ing relationship to animals, whom he first competed with for surviv- al, then domesticated, and finally re-brutalised - ideas that, interest- ingly, are nearly all picked out for comment in the copy of Lucre- tius belonging to the Medici's banker, Francesco Sassetti.25 The themes of religion and evolution are not necessarily linked to each other, but they became associated by the events in Florence in the 1490s, when a combination of revolution and famine gave reality to Lucretius's ideas about primitive society and the faltering, chancy growth of civilisation - ideas that were reflected in paintings at the time, as well as in humanist writings. Nearly all these ideas can be found in other classical writers, but Lucretius's personal oscillation between hope and fear, love and misogyny, primitivism and civility, makes his thought distinctive, with resonances - when we find them - that can only come from him. Bartolomeo Scala is one writer in whom such resonances can be found, another is his successor as chancellor, Marcello Adriani, who in turn leads us to Niccolo Machiavelli, the most famous representative of the revolution in think- ing about law, politics and religion at the beginning of the early modern period. Among artists, Piero di Cosimo is the most obvious among several other Florentines to reflect these ideas. In differing ing strands in Botticelli's Life and Work' in Sandro Botticelli.

Fear and death More important than De rerum natura's opening theme of love is its central concern with death and the fear of death, which Lucretius strove to dispel by arguing that there is no after-life. To fifteenth- century readers, surely the poem's most immediate relevance lay in its attempt to demonstrate the irrationality of "trembling, in the light of day, at what is no more terrible than what little boys shiver at in the dark, imagining what is about to happen".26 As Jean Delumeau has famously demonstrated, sin and fear were dominant themes in late medieval and Renaissance society, fuelled by Mendicant ser- mons and repeated cycles of plague.27 This was especially true of Florence, where its merchants were vulnerable to an additional "ma- laise of soul" - as Peter Howard has called it - due to their dubious entrepreneurial activities and noted unwillingness to enter a church. It was in Florence that the ecumenical Church Council of 1439 chose to reiterate the decree of a much earlier Council, that "Those souls who die in the state of Deadly Sin, or with the sole Original Sin, will go down into Hell" - its promise that there they would "nonetheless be punished with differing penalties" surely less a source of comfort than a further worry about how to address these differ- entials.28 The same must also have been true of Mendicant sermons, especially the sermons and writings that Savonarola addressed to Florentines on "the art of dying well", which urged them to "go 26 LUCRETIUS II, 55-8: "Nam veluti pueri trepidant atque omnia caecis / in tenebris metuunt, sic nos in luce timemus / interdum nilo quae sunt metuenda magis quam / quae pueri in tenebris pavitant finguntque futura" (in translating Lucretius I use the Loeb trans- lation of ROUSE-SMITH, London, 1982, and also that of A. M. ESOLEN, Baltimore, 1995). 27 J. DELUMEAU, Sin and Fear: the Emergence of a Western Guilt Culture, 13th-18th Centuries, 1983, transl. London, 1990. 28 P.

Since Lucretius's poem articulated fear of death and the unknown, it may well have resonated with even devout Christians, especially the merchants and humanist intellectuals who were its early readers. Is it possible to go farther than this, and say that even the unbelief of Lucretius and Epicurus had more appeal than churchmen and moralists would like us to believe? We know that people were sceptical about ideas that ran counter to their everyday experience and commonsense, such as the resurrec- tion of the body. It was not only the country peasants of Montaillou who joked about the possibility of dead souls returning "one day in the same bones as were theirs before" and "coming to life again with this flesh and these bones": "what an idea, I don't believe it!"'31 29 In his popular printed manual On the Art of Dying Well, cited and translated by L.

Among the heresies that Cristoforo Landino lists as alive in his day, in his 1481 Dante Commentary, is the belief of the Patarines that "our bodies won't rise again", that it is "a mortal sin to kill any animal excepting fish, fleas and lice", and that "usury is not a sin if done without fraud" - suggesting perhaps some con- tinuity between the early Catharism of merchant and banking fam- ilies in Florence like the Pulci, and the heretical views of the Medici poet Luigi Pulci in the fifteenth century, who was deprived of a Christian burial ob scripta prophana prophano in loco, that is, for de- crying miracles and describing the soul as "no more than a pine nut in hot white bread".34 We are also told that the chancellor Carlo semble que le corps human se dissout et se transforme en terre; c'est pourquoi je n'ai jamais pu croire, et je ne crois toujours pas, qu'un tel corps puisse jamais ressusciter", 127 (inqui- sition of Guillaume Fort). 32 A.

This, Francesco Giovanni wrote in his diary, made it difficult to record anything about "the matter of his soul", especially since he also left no instructions about "the distri- bution of his possessions"; that someone could be "so far-sighted in life and then so totally blind when he came to die" was a cause for amazement among the people, Giovanni commented: "May God let him rest in peace if it pleases him to do s Neither Marsuppini nor Pulci typify popular unbelief in Flor- ence, since one was a learned humanist and the other an irreverent parodist of the recondite debates in Medici circles in the 1470s about the soul, "where it enters and where it leaves". Yet Pulci be- longs to the tradition of versifying represented by Burchiello that does throw light on popular attitudes to religion. The lines in Pulci's Morgante, for instance, "But what rises, in the end descends [...] while one rises, another falls, as perhaps happens with Christianity" are re- flected in the verse, or frottola, with which a printed pamphlet at- tacking Savonarola in 1496 ends: "he who hasn't too much faith doesn't sin or fail too much, when dead he returns afloat; who is dead goes to the bottom, and this is what happens in the world".36 1986, pp. 38-42 esp. 41.

When we turn to the earliest citations of De rerum natura in Flor- ence, we find that the removal of fear was what Marsilio Ficino re- garded as a key to understanding "all the rest". Asked by his friends in 1457 to explain Lucretius's philosophy to them, Ficino chose pas- sages describing Lucretius's desire to remove pain from the body, so that the mind "can enjoy the sense of pleasure far removed from care or fear", and also passages describing his admiration for Epicurus in "putting a limit to desire and fear" by showing us the strait and nar- row path to the highest good that we all desire.39 At the end of that rario in senso parodico [...] in un ben preciso filone burchiellesco", ORVIETO, Pulci me- dievale, op. cit.

They also differ from each other in the words and passages they quote. Fi- cino's letter describes only the four principal sects, with much more on Epicurus (illustrated by quotations from De rerum natura) than Scala's pithy, but accurate, summary provides, while Scala's letter is overall much longer, with more on the pre-Socratics (including Democritus and Empedocles) and less on Epicurus, towards whose doctrine of pleasure he remained critical. Nevertheless, as Eugenio Garin says in his discussion of the two letters, Scala's parting shot is surprisingly 'innovative' in declaring that "some things were writ- ten by Epicurus quite divinely", even though he thought the pagan philosophers were wrong about many things.42 animo satis hec vestigia parva sagaci.

A. BROWN, Tempe, Az., 1997, pp. 251-261, quoting LUCRETIUS I, 830 (on homomeria). Only Scala's letter is dated (24 April 1458), but it seems likely both were written as exercises around the same time. Scala's letter was ascribed by Stein, in his 1888 edition of the letter cited in Brown, above, p. 251, to Giovanbattista Buoninsegni. 42 "nonnulla etiam ab Epicuro scripta sane divinitus. Aberrarunt etiam in multis", ed. 26</page><page sequence="17">LUCRETIUS AND THE EPICUREANS Scala reverted to the theme of Epicurean pleasure, now defined as "quiet and tranquillity of mind", in the treatise he dedicated to Piero de' Medici, "On whether a wise man should marry", written around the same time. This was a topic discussed by Epicurus, whom Scala takes as his starting point, arguing (initially) that as Epicurus placed marriage on the borderline between good and evil, a wise man should not marry because he should never be in doubt.43 This was exactly the period when Scala began to work as Pierfran- cesco de' Medici's secretary, becoming - like Ficino, who was the son of Cosimo's doctor - an intimate of the Medici palace. So it is tempting to see the family's private library as the source of their knowledge of Lucretius and Epicurus, since it contained manu- scripts of both De rerum natura and Traversari's translation of Diogenes Laertius's Lives by the early thirties.44 They would also have been familiar with the series of medallions in the Medici courtyard, completed around 1460, which perhaps reflect some Lucretian influ- ence in the contrast they draw between primitive life ante legem and civilisation sub lege.45 BROWN, op. cit.

In comparing Ficino's much fuller characterisation of Epicurus with Scala's (which, following Stein, he mistakenly attributes to Buoninsegni), Garin nevertheless identifies in Scala's "tematica tradizionale" (an account of the sects derived from St. Augustine and Ci- cero's Academics, as well as Diogenes Laertius), "un motivo fortemente innovatore".

Quoting Lucretius, he concluded that it was much better for the world to be governed by reason, as the Stoics believed, than by for- tuitous atoms.46 It is in his next major writing, the Dialogue of Con- solation written on the death of Cosimo's son Giovanni in 1463, that Scala engaged most clearly with the Stoic-Epicurean debate in the area that I suggested was closest to contemporary concerns, fear and death. In it, Cosimo is made to adopt a more favourable view of the Epicurean doctrine of pleasure when he hears that the Epicureans regard grief as the worst of evils and much less tolerable than it is for the Stoics - despite the dangerous public implications of their morality: "Would you set fire to your country and burn the sacred buildings and temples of the gods to escape grief? Surely not!"47 But it is the passages quoted by Cosimo from Lucretius that best il- lustrate how Lucretius was seen to be relevant to him and to the ar- gument of the Dialogue. Countering Scala's attempt to assuage his grief with Stoic arguments, Cosimo exclaims, "with Lucretius" (in the passage already quoted by Ficino in his treatise De voluptate), "O pitiable minds of men and blinded hearts! In what gloom and darkness life, such as it is, is spent". In going on to quote Lucretius's additional observation that sickness and fear are undeterred by gold, fine raiment and status, he makes the argument all the more ad hominem, for Cosimo was of course a man whose wealth and posi- tion not only did nothing to assuage his grief but were in themselves completed around 1460; although the theme of evolution is not immediately apparent - perhaps because the medallions are based on ancient gems - they do reflect some Lucretian topics.

For instead of opening with conventional words of Christian consolation, Scala begins by discursing on the immortal gods' gifts to man - and especially to Cosimo. Man, Scala tells Cosimo, was created by the gods in their image, not from mud or stones, as Ovid and the myths of Pandora, Pyrrha and Deucalion would have us believe; for when the poets said that man was made out of hard wood and trunks, they surely intended to describe prim- itive man's emergence, "nude and hairy", from the protective shel- ter of tree trunks in the early days when he lived without hearth or home, wandering freely through the woods. But although Scala alludes to Ovid, in fact his account of early man - perhaps reflecting the theme of the courtyard medallions - is drawn more obviously from Lucretius and the hard primitivists, who unlike Ovid regarded this first stage of human life as far from golden.50 As a public official, chancellor of the Guelf Party and soon to be 48 SCALA, Dialogus de consolatione, in SCALA, ed.

Yet he was clearly attracted to both writers by the early 1460s. Some of the writings of Epicurus he called "divine", and the same was true for Lucretius. We can still read the first five lines of De rerum natura that Scala transcribed in his own hand on a page of his notebook, and we also know that by the 1480s he had written a poem, De rebus naturalibus, which "was modelled on Lucretius'.51 Moreover, unlike Ficino and Poliziano, who also read Lucretius, Scala was never constrained by taking holy orders. This meant that he and others like him could - and indeed should, according to Bartolomeo Fonzio - publish their early secular writings, "impeded by no religion", whereas "we ministers of God" faced a moral dilemma about whether to publish them or not.52 So whereas Ficino burnt his youthful commentary on Lucretius, Scala's early writings survive as useful guides to his mature thinking. If not for their doctrine of pleasure, what attracted him to Epicurus and Lucretius? He was attracted, I think, by both of the themes I have already outlined, to do with fear and death, and man's evolution. Not only did they engage his interest as a student but, as we shall see, they continued to influence his mature writings as chan- cellor, especially his 1483 Dialogue on Laws and Legal Judgements and his 1496 defence of Savonarola, the Defence against the Critics of Florence, in which he worked out the wider implications of Epi- curean ethics and the theory of evolution for a new public morality. However, it is his intimate fables as well as his late poem On trees 51 "instar Lucretii", shown to Michele Verino (who died 1487) by Antonio Geraldini, see BROWN, op. cit. (see note 35), pp. 209-210, note 49. The lines of De rerum natura, head- ed "Lucretius", are written in the margin of fol. 20v, Modena, Bibl. Estense, Raccolta Campori Appendice 235 (Gamma P.2.5), which contains one early poem (1458-60) and one later sonnet. Interestingly, atoms appear as expressions of minimalism in Scala's chan- cery letters and mandates from 1465, e.g. ASF Legazioni e Commissarie 16, fol. 7v, 1 Aug. 1465: "una minima particella"; Minutarii 12, fol. 318r, 13 June 1482: "uno athomo di tempo". 52 BARTOLOMEO FONZIO, Epistolarum libri III, ed.

It is probably no coincidence that Scala used the ambiguous genre of fables to discuss these potentially dangerous ideas, since, like his dialogues, they allow veiled and multiple readings. Supersti- tion (religio) and the fear of death are recurring themes in these fa- bles, which he began to write in the 1480s and continued to write, as "annual tribute" to the Medici, until 1492.53 In the fable Religio, for example, we are told that the origin of most gods can be ascribed to fear, timor, an argument which he attributes to Lucretius in his 1483 Dialogue on Laws and Legal Judgements, where Lucretius is cited to demonstrate that one meaning of religion derives from religare, to bind, from whose knots Lucretius sought to free us.54 The associa- tion of fear and death recurs in his second collection of fables in Death, in which a traveller is amazed to encounter people with ban- daged eyes fleeing the onslaught of Death, portrayed as a wild beast mounted on a black horse striking out at random: "How needlessly they fear (quam temere timent) and bind their eyes, if this is living, isn't it better to die?"55 Death is also the subject of Scala's two last fables which he sent to Piero de' Medici on the first All Souls Day after the death of his father, Lorenzo il Magnifico, in 1492. In the first, the shades are pre- vented by law from returning to earth except on this day, so that the living will not lose their fear of them through familiarity; but they then flock in such numbers to visit the living, moved by longing for the light of day, that the rulers are left almost alone - whereupon 53 As he explained to Piero de' Medici in 1492, see SCALA, ed. BROWN, Op. cit. (see note 41), letter no. 211, p. 170.

In the second fable, when a per- sistent shade eventually wins Pluto's permission to visit the living on All Souls Day and encounters a living man, their conversation turns to whether it is better to live in continual fear of death or to lack the good things of life. "The good things of life!", the shade exclaims with gales of laughter, "What is generally believed about you among us is true. You with your possessions are more dead than the dead themselves".56 The shades, of course, are pagan, but by playing on the correspondence between Halloween and All Souls Day and by emphasising the close connection between fear and death - fear of material loss and fear of the afterlife which feeds religion - the moral of these fables is widely applicable to Christians as well as to non-believers. Perhaps not surprisingly in this Aesopian genre, humans in Scala's fables are poor creatures, much weaker than animals. In one fa- ble on Man, a wolf laughs at the lion for being scared of man: "Are you, our king, frightened of spectres? If you flee, man is bold; if you act, he flees. Man isn't man, he only seems to be a man". In another, Diogenes the Cynic, surveying the activities of humankind, suddenly sees men as though they were animals in an 'Animal Farm' - as pigs, foxes, wolves and harpies according to their various professions, be- lying their claim to be superior to animals. This idea is repeated in the fable Monster, in which the Cynic comments that humans are just as 'monstrous' as the strange animals that amaze people as mon- sters, since man is equally multiform with the head of a serpent and a human face, the throat of a dog, hands of Harpies, bent and de- formed with nails: "Tell me, if you will, what is a monster if you aren't monsters?"57 56 Apologi II, Appendix 3, 101, "Inferorum regnum", 102, "Vivi mortui": "'Bona vi- tae!' risit. 'Et quae apud nos', inquit, 'de vobis vulgo fertur sententia vera est: vos his bonis quam mortui magis estis mortui'", ed. BROWN, op. cit. (see note 41), p. 393. See also the fable Mortul (II, 47, ed. BROWN, p. 379), which ends - playing on the same words: "Nam non mortui modo mortui, sed vivi mortui", perhaps contrasting pagan with Christian immortality, in describing Icarus's fall from the heavens and burial in a tomb, where he was immortalised by the Muses ("Vivit at in tumulo" according to the epigram inscribed on it); but the door dropped off, "For corpses are not dead now, but corpses are alive". 57 Apologi II, 24 (Homo [II]: "Neque iam homo homo est: videtur homo"; II, 1 32</page><page sequence="23">LUCRETIUS AND THE EPICUREANS It is difficult to know how seriously to take Scala's mocking and sceptical approach to superstition, religion and man's fearful nature, for which Lucian must have provided him with a model as well as Epicurus. In the fable Gods, the atheist Diagoras wins his case against the charge of impiety, because "who can believe they are gods that have morals like these?", whereas Epicureans tend to have the best of the debate in his fables when they discuss morality and death with sceptics or Christians.58 In the fable Moral Values, a Cynic, after dining intemperately with an Epicurean, describes his post- prandial dream of an upside-down world, fish swimming on dry land and horses carried by men, to which the Epicurean replies that the one marvel missing from his list is that grief and hard work are pre- ferred to pleasure, and cares and worries to leisure and a tranquil life: "you weren't dreaming, believe me, life is lived with upside- down morals".59 And in the fable Immortality, which comments on problems created by the idea of purgatory and the soul's immor- tality, a human soul, still without a fixed abode, is wandering about pondering the penalties of his impure life. Encountering an Epicu- rean, the human soul tells him that he, the Christian, is immortal and that "those fables of yours, which have completely taken hold every- where" cannot change his nature or the truth. To which the Epicu- rean smilingly replies: "Be which ever of the gods you like while you are wandering around and being punished". Is it significant that Scala deleted the last line, 'But I am immortal', the human soul said, 'and I haven't died', leaving the last word with the Epicurean, whose beliefs "have completely taken hold everywhere?"60 Did Scala believe in Christian immortality?

Unusually, he made no religious be- quests in his will and "didn't trouble himself about funeral rites" (as Epicurus also commended), leaving it to his son to institute masses for him and his wife after his death. A contemporary account of the miracles of the Virgin at SS. Annunziata suggests that he owed his escape from death in 1474 solely to the pious intercession of his mother-in-law, without which his life, "which he himself had so in- temperately neglected" would have come to an end. Writing to Lorenzo de' Medici in the 1470s, he explained that he believed letters - by which he meant the discipline of the liberal arts consisting of the study of human and divine affairs - were far more immortal than other human activities. For, he wrote, everything we do eventually perishes and nothing lasts for long, yet "we are accustomed to speak in this way and to honour whatever is lasting with the name of im- mortality, which is peculiar to divine things".6' As the son of a pro- vincial miller, he may have shared the popular fatalism that Cerretani described and responded positively to these newly-discovered pagan philosophers.62 It is Scala's Dialogue on Laws and Legal Judgements that most clearly shows the naturalistic direction of his more public thinking strae, quibus omnia completis, fabulae aut naturam nostram veritatemque immutant".

The argument of the dialogue is presented in the form of a debate between Scala and Bernardo Machiavelli, Niccolo's father. In it, "Scala" presents the argument for the existence of a universal law of nature "common to animals as well as to all mankind", even to uncivilised and primitive nations who are inca- pable of speech and reason.63 The basis of this law is mutual self-in- terest, according to "the sign" that Nature has set before us: "'Do nothing to another person', nature says, 'that you do not wish to be done to you"'. The biblical source of this law is obvious, and Scala himself goes on to allude to it in saying that "Our Saviour teaches us the same thing". But a clue to his possible first source is provided by his use of the word "sign", since this is the word used by Epicurus (in Traversari's translation) to describe his Law of Nature as "a sign of expedience, that you shouldn't harm another or be harmed". So Scala may have been drawing on Epicurus as well as the Bible, Epicurus's list of natural precepts or maxims (as listed by Diogenes Laertius) being comparable to those of Christ in the Gospels.64 When Scala returned to discuss religion in his last official writing, his 1496 Defence of Savonarola, he described it entirely in naturalistic and anthropological terms, as something common to all peoples, "however barbarous and savage, who lack religion alto- gether, in so far as it is born (innascatur) in our bodies together with our soul and grows together with it". And similarly, the gift of proph- ecy - or what Scala calls "prescience of future things", which is also common to almost all peoples. A religion that is "born in our bodies together with our soul", common to barbarians as well as Christians, recalls Lucretius's concept of our mind or spirit being 63 SCALA, De legibus, ed.

When Scala refers to Lucretius in his dialogue, it is to quote his view of religion as a tight bondage, p. 363, quoting Lucretius I, 931-932: "et artis religionum animos nodis exsolvere pergo". 35</page><page sequence="26">ALISON BROWN born, growing and dying with the body, or as he puts it, "the nature of the mind and spirit is corporeal".65 It was at the beginning of this Defence that Scala embarked on a disquisition on the power of fortune in life that demonstrates even more directly the continuing influence of Lucretius on his thinking at this time - which is as surprising in this context as his unexpected Lucretian opening on man's primitive origins was in his 1463 Dia- logue of Consolation to Cosimo. Digressing with "a few words about fortune, which they say overturns all mortal affairs according to her will and pleasure", Scala went on in the Defence to attribute to "that admirable poet Lucretius" (whom Virgil himself, "the king, so to speak, of Latin poets, did not blush to insert whole into his poem") the view that the world originated in "the fortuitous clash of invisi- ble atoms". Although he said he was not "totally convinced" by this view of the power of fortune, he was equally sceptical about those "who remove fortune totally from human affairs", acknowl- edging that no discipline was so exact that - without God's dispensa- tion - it could deflect nature's impetus when it raged against us, "as has clearly happened to us now" (after Florence's loss of Montepul- ciano and Pisa).66 The similarity of these views about religion and the power of for- tune to Niccolo Machiavelli's will be discussed at a later stage. What is notable here is how much this religious naturalism also owed to 65 Apologia, ed. BROWN, op. cit. (see note 41), pp. 407-410: "Neque ulli usquam po- puli gentesve adeo barbarae immanesque leguntur quae omni penitus religione privarentur, utputa quae cum anima simul innascatur in corpus et cum aetate inolescat simul" (p. 407); "Prophetae ergo nomen [...] nos vel divinatores vel vates, qui futura praedicunt possumus (ut arbitror) appellare [...]. Apud omnes ferme gentes (nisi fallor) semper fuit opinio aliqua prae- scientiae rerum futurarum" (p. 408). Cf.

Scala based his argument for the exis- tence of a natural law on legal practice in Turkey, as reported by Ital- ian merchants who traded there, and on the discovery by King John of Portugal of "new islands and hitherto unknown peoples" in Afri- ca.67 The fact that these people were able to live without a written language or laws provided Scala with evidence not only of the exis- tence of an unwritten natural law but also of the evolutionary devel- opment of language. For although it was Bernardo Machiavelli in the Dialogue who attacked Scala's idea of an illiterate people with the argument that even uncivilised peoples use "signs as a sort of alpha- bet" - just as birds and animals use signs to communicate with each other - in fact the argument comes from Lucretius and serves to support the idea of natural evolution. For it was Lucretius who ar- gued against Aristotle that language developed from animal-like cries and was not, as Aristotle believed, an innate faculty which dis- tinguished men from animals.68 Primitivism and evolution As Scala's 1483 Dialogue suggests, Lucretius's evolutionary ac- count of the growth of civilisation is a second theme that had partic- ular relevance in the fifteenth century, especially in Florence, where merchants and scholars were actively involved in the discovery of new lands and peoples in Africa and the New World. The city's im- portance as a centre of scholarly interest in voyages of exploration was evident from the excitement aroused by Ptolemy's Geography 67 De legibus, ed. BROWN, Op. cit.

For after Manuel Chrysoloras introduced Ptolemy as a teaching text in Florence in 1400, it excited not only humanists but also merchants and cartogra- phers, who helped to make Florence a centre of "cartographic and geographic study", patronised not only by the Portuguese royal fam- ily but also by French cardinals. It was there in 1482 that the Flor- entine scholar Francesco Berlinghieri printed a treatise on Ptolemy whose significance for the early history of cartography "is difficult to overestimate".69 The interest in foreign places and peoples fostered by this cli- mate is illustrated by the almost anthropological response of the hu- manist Poggio Bracciolini to far-flung travellers to the Church Coun- cil held in Florence in 1439. The Council brought to the city a Ve- netian merchant home from India, a northern Indian (understood through an Armenian interpreter), and some Ethiopians, who came "from almost outside the world itself" and who reported the exis- tence of peoples beyond the limits of the world recognised by Ptolemy. They were all interviewed by Poggio, who found Conti's ac- count of his journey "to such remote peoples, where they were sited, their different customs, and especially about their animals and trees" so gripping and so credible that he decided to record what he had heard as "worthy of being known".70 Poggio was also, of course, the discoverer of Lucretius, with whom he shared a sceptical ap- proach to religion as well as an interest in people and their customs. Although he apparently never quoted directly from De rerum natura, his writings nevertheless reveal traces of its influence, such as the misery of children from the time of their birth and the hardships 69 According to J.

He had been chancellor of the Guelf Party when it was responsible for maritime affairs, from 1459 to 1465, involving him early on in the voyages of Florentine merchants abroad that stimulated his maturer thinking about primi- tivism. As we have seen, it was the travels of merchants to Turkey and the recent discovery by the Portuguese in Africa of "previously unknown peoples who live completely without laws, like beasts obeying nature" that encouraged his new thinking about natural law and the origin of language in his 1483 Dialogue on Laws and Le- gal Judgements. The excitement in Florence about the Portuguese exploration of Africa is also documented by a letter read out in the main square of the city three years later, in 1486, which reported the "splendid and great news" just arrived from Portugal: a great lord of Ghinea had been baptized and the king of Portugal had sent experts to teach the natives Portughese and "train them in good be- haviour [...] [in order to] introduce them to a human and not a bestial life".72 For Scala, however, the interest of these lawless peoples lay not in their conversion to a civiised and Christian life but in the fact that they were able to live peaceably as "beasts, obeying nature", employing "signs as a sort of alphabet".73 In this social and intellectual context, it was perhaps not surpris- ing that Epicurus sprang to Amerigo Vespucci's mind when describ- ing the similarly lawless natives he encountered on his voyages to 71 According to M. DAVIES, Ioc. cit. (see note 10), p. 124, note 7, Poggio "never quotes Lucretius".

Amerigo was a nephew of Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a learned scholar who owned a map of Ptolemy and was tutor to both Amerigo and his patron Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.74 So, as a merchant and explorer, Amerigo, too, reflects the close relationship between exploration and hu- manist culture in Florence. The letter he wrote to Lorenzo di Pier- francesco after his first voyage to south America in 1498 shows the same "anthropological" interest as Poggio did in the customs of other peoples, describing in detail the life of the natives, their barbarity in not eating at fixed times and without tablecloths, their love of plea- sure and unwonted sexual practices - as well as the absence of the sanctions of law and religion. For, he wrote, "these people, as far as we could see, employed no laws [...] nor did they even keep houses of prayer: their life I judge to be Epicurean".75 Vespucci, like Scala, evidently found in Epicurus and Lucretius a useful interpretative model to explain the mores of these happy naturists, who seemed to live in peace without the visible constraints of law and threats of the after-life. Beasts who "obeyed their nature" represented the worst side of man's nature according to traditional Christian and classical moral- ity, as the image of the Centaur, half-man, half-animal, demonstrates. The Centaur was portrayed negatively by Dante and his commenta- tors, as a bellicose and tyrannical man dominated by animal passions: the very opposite of man created in God's image. For as Landino ex- plained in his Commentary on Dante, Chiron was "half man, half horse because he was a bellicose man, brutalised by his ambition and lust to dominate, although not totally lacking in learning or 74 On Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, who later became a Dominican friar in San Marco, GOMBRICH, "Botticelli's Mythologies" loc. cit.

The contrast between this view of centaurs and Machiavelli's in the early sixteenth century is striking. Far from condemning man's bestiality, Machiavelli proposed the centaur Chiron as a model for princes because he believed man's bestial qualities were as important as his human rationality for survival.77 Centaurs were, of course, mythical beasts, and although they were apparently a familiar sight in Florence, where they "roamed the streets" during patronal festivities, Lucretius did not believe in them - "never did such an animal exist!" Nevertheless, he did ac- cept the reality of their image, which he explained was created by superimposing the images of man and horse, meeting by accident. By explaining them as a double image, he lent support to the sym- bolic interpretation of the dual attributes of man's nature that was so familiar to Florentines, thanks to writers like Dante, Landino and Machiavelli and to the artists who illustrated their ideas78 (Figs. 2 and 3). More than centaurs, however, it was Lucretius's description of man's early life and development that helped to narrow the gap between the spe- cies. Far from being created in God's image, primitive man, accord- ing to Lucretius, lived "the vagrant life of wild animals", which he hunted and was hunted by in turn. Civilisation developed when men tired of living in violence and agreed to submit to laws, which were 76 LANDINO, Commentary on Dante, op. cit.

Here it is interesting to contrast Botticelli's moralising painting of Camilla [or Pal- las] and the Centaur, painted for the Medici in the early 1480s, and his naturalistic centaurs illustrating the Divine Comedy, drawn probably in the 1490s for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco (Figs. 3 and 2); see also note 107 below. 41</page><page sequence="32">ALISON BROWN upheld by fear of punishment and their guarantee of security, to "provide support and material prosperity", as Epicurus put it.79 But this was not necessarily a mark of progress, for increased domestica- tion not only made men "soft" in pitying the weak instead of admiring the strong, but - "quite unbelievably", Lucretius said, - it made them re-brutalise the very animals they had domesticated by making them engines of war. This, as Saylor has suggested, serves to reinforce Lucretius's argument that it was man who allowed the good instinctual drives he shared with animals to be perverted by his growing sophis- tication, which recoiled against himself in the same way that the re- trained animals turned against their owners.80 This account of man's development was followed by Scala and Machiavelli, both of whom adopted a primitivist explanation of man's early life - and, interestingly, it is one of the themes picked out in Fon- zio's copy of Lucretius for Francesco Sassetti, which notes in the mar- gin "on the first kind of man and how wild and uncultivated he was".81 A more distinctive - and much less discussed - aspect of Lucretius's influence on them, however, is his account of the compli- cated and changing relationship between men and animals. This, too, I would argue, also left its mark on them, particularly on Scala and the panels with which he illustrated the courtyard of his "urban villa" in Borgo Pinti. These panels, as Alessandro Parronchi pointed out some time ago, are based on his fables, in which the relationship between men and animals is an important theme. In the courtyard of Scala's home in Borgo Pinti animals are portrayed in four panels, one, Ma- 79 LUCRETIUS V, 932: "volgivago vitam tractabant more ferarum", followed by Scala in his Dialogus de consolatione and in his poem De arboribus, quoted in notes 50 above and 100 below; MACHIAVELLI, Discorsi, I, 2, in II Principe e Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio, ed.

It has been suggested by James Draper that overall the frieze re- presents "a movement from the depths of bestiality, represented by the rampaging centaurs and the destructive influences of war among men and between men and animals [...] towards more civilizing influ- ences', a programme generalised enough to reconcile the neoplato- nism popular in Lorenzo de' Medici's cultural circle with the Lucre- tian direction of Scala's own thought.83 But so simplified a reading 82 A.

(see note 35), p. 317, I suggested Aristo- tle's Politics as a possible explanation of the opposing panels of peace and war, business and leisure, but, as SEGAL says, op. cit. (see note 22), p. 211: "contrasting tableaux of war and peace" are also to be found in De rerum natura, serving "as the emblems of the divergent paths human life can take". 83 J. DRAPER, Bertoldo di Giovanni, Columbia-London, 1992, pp. 220-253, now repeated by ACIDINI LUCHINAT, loc. cit. (see note 82), p. 94, who combines its theme of the ascent of a self-made man with "un progresso - per quanto discontinuo e contorto - dell'umanita dal vizio verso la virtu". Acidini Luchinat, too, wants to progress from left to right but she begins, not with Drunkenness, the first panel on the west wall facing the entrance, but with Negligence, the last panel on the south wall. Although Draper claims his left to right reading is based on Alessandro Parronchi, in fact Parronchi (loc. cit. [see note 82], p. 124-125) suggests a more complicated reading of contrasting south-north and west-east walls, the lateral panels of each converging on the central panel to attain "a central equilibrium". According to A. CHASTEL (Art et Humanisme a Florence au temps de Laurent le Magnifique, Paris, 1959, p. 277), the panels (which he misorientates, as does Acidini Luchinat in her description of plates 51-54) represent a "psychomachie" or conflict between the rational and the irrational parts of the soul. 43</page><page sequence="34">ALISON BROWN surely fails to do justice to the subtlety of his ideas and the strong vein of irony in both the fables and the frieze. Although Scala tells us in Sovereignty that "sovereignty stood firm on the side of virtue", the quiet animal council of war to the right of the panel makes it by no means clear that he intended to represent (as Parronchi has sug- gested) a victory for "human virtue" against "the alliance of animal forces",84 or that the programme as a whole represents progress to- wards civilisation (Fig. 5). The courtyard frieze, as well as Scala's other fables, indicates that his target was not animal bestiality but man's misuse of animals and misuse of his own animal passions, through drunkenness, excessive love and bellicosity - all of which are also criticised by Lucretius - civilisation being at best a mixed blessing.85 In the panel Magnanimity a bull is savaged by a lion - but not before the sight of a hare, safely sheltering from hounds be- tween the lion's paws, gives him hope that he too may be saved (Fig. 6). The moral of Scala's fable - that "it's often better to be a weak suppliant than to resist boldly" - anticipates the argument of Machia- velli's The Golden Ass, that animals are kinder to each other and more virtuous than men. Were both Scala and Machiavelli giving ex- pression to the Lucretian idea that it was man who was responsible for violence? For by allowing his instinctual drives to be perverted by his growing sophistication, he not only rebrutalised the animals he had domesticated but, as Lucretius suggested, also himself. Scala's fables themselves do not allow us to answer this question. Nor do the panels, which were influenced not only by Scala's texts but also by the fashionable artistic models of the day, Bertoldo's bronze battle relief of ca. 1476 from the palace of Lorenzo the Magnificent and Pollaiuolo's probably earlier and widely diffused en- graving, Battle of Nude Men.86 To do so, we have to move to the 84 PARRONCHI, Ioc. cit.

Lucretian ideology in Florence after 1494 The years from 1494 to 1498 were a time not only of political in- novation and economic hardship but also of cultural innovation. Lu- cretian ideology had never been overt during the years of Lorenzo il Magnifico's hegemony which had favoured a contrasting neopla- tonic culture.87 Compared with the hierarchical elitism and cosmic determinism favoured by Lorenzo's Golden Age ideology, Lucretius represented a counter-culture that emphasised primitivism, natural evolution and the role of chance in life. Now, however, Lucretius's primitivism was not only topical but it was favoured by the men who enjoyed power in Florence, especially Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici and his circle of friends. Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco returned from exile with his brother Giovanni on the expulsion of his cousins, the children of Lorenzo il Magnifico, in November 1494 and briefly re-entered Florentine political life as Lorenzo Popolano.88 One naissance Florence.

Another was the Greek poet and soldier Michele Marullo, who is said to have read a few verses of Lucretius every night before going to bed and reputedly died by drowning in the Cecina with Lucretius in his pocket. He probably developed his love of Lucretius in Rome and Naples in the 1480s, dedicating his Lucretian Hymni naturales to his exiled Neapolitan patron, Antonello da Sanseverino, prince of Salerno. But when he came to Florence in 1489, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco be- came his patron - and Bartolomeo Scala his friend, later to become his father-in-law. Together, Marullo, Sanseverino and Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco plotted the overthrow of the political regimes of Flor- ence and Naples and so were actively involved in the revolution that transformed the cultural climate in Florence.89 The revolution also coincided with the appointment of a new university teacher, Marcello Adriani, who broke entirely with the old philological tradition of Poliziano and turned towards a new in- terest in natural history - as Peter Godman has recently demon- strated.90 The prolusion to his first year's lectures on poetry and ora- tory was given on 24 October 1494, just before the collapse of the old regime. In it, Lucretius was mentioned early on as one of the an- cient writers who used poetry to describe the universe, but although - in the days just before the regime fell - Adriani was careful to voice his disapproval of Lucretius's "useless heresy about atoms", this and subsequent lectures show how well he knew De rerum natura and Medicean supremacy?", revised in The Medici in Florence, op. cit.

Every man, wise in staying strong, surviving, kept for himself the spoils that fortune offered'."92 It was evidently in response to Adriani's early lectures on ancient rhetoric and philosophy that Savonarola spent time in his Lenten sermons in 1496 ridiculing the early philosophers who "said the maddest things about the natural world you've ever heard", among whom it was the atomists he attacked most, inviting the women in his audience to listen and laugh at the idea that the world "was made with atoms, that is, with those tiniest of particles that fly through the air".93 That Adriani felt himself to be the butt of Savonarola's ridi- cule is clear from his reference in 1497 to the attacks of those who thought his teaching was impious and harmful to his students, 91 GODMAN, op. cit. (see note 90), p. 154, "vanam de athomis heresim" (Florence, Bibl. Riccardiana MS. 811 [Ric 811], fol. 2r). This prolusion (which quotes 11 lines of Lu- cretius, I, 936-48, on fol. 3r), is also discussed by VERDE, op. cit. (see note 90), pp. 1160- 1163; on its date, ID., Studio, II, (Florence, 1973), pp. 476-477. In what follows, I cite Ric. 811 as the principal source for Adriani's prolusions, this and other MS sources being fully discussed by B. RICHARDSON, "A Manuscript of Biagio Buonaccorsi", Bibliotheque d'Humanisme et Renaissance, 36, 1974, pp. 593-595. According to Godman, there is "no external evidence" to support the idea that Machiavelli's Lucretius was copied for Adriani (Vat. Ross. 884, see GODMAN, p. 149, note 105), but Adriani was certainly very familiar with all the text, as his prolusions demonstrate. 92 Ric. 811, fol. 8v: "Verisimile itaque est ante conditas urbes prima lla novitate mundi, quo tempore ut Lucretius ait, 'Nec commune bonum poterant spectare, neque ullis / moribus inter se scibant nec legibus uti. / quod cuique obtulerat praedae fortuna, ferebat / sponte sua sibi quisque valere et vivere doctus'", quoting Lucretius V, 958-61 (transl. ESOLEN). The prolusion is discussed by GODMAN, pp. 156-159 (op. cit. see note 90), VERDE, Studio, IV, 3, op. cit. (see note 90), pp. 1205-1208, RICHARDSON, loc. cit.

So in his pro- lusion at the start of the 1496-1497 academic year, Lucretius was un- named but he provided both Adriani's opening description of the "shipwrecks" and storms that for the last two years had "tossed us asunder" and his later discussion of language. As teacher of gram- mar, Adriani explained his task was to perfect the way humans and animals - like dogs and horses, and especially birds - used language for different purposes. Although he thought that men had much more complicated vocal systems than animals, to express their more com- plicated thoughts, it was clearly Lucretius, rather than "Maro" whom he cited, who provided him with his imagery as well as with his description of the utilitarian origin of language when men first began to live together.95 The same use of Lucretius can be seen in his prolusion at the be- ginning of the following academic year, 1497-1498. In it, instead of addressing himself to Virgil and Aristophanes (as planned), he talked instead about the utility of the liberal arts in the straitened circumstances of this year of war and famine. The prolusion has been described in great detail and clarity by Armando Verde for 94 "inutile nos et impium et iuvenum animis noxium tractare opus credunt ob falsas rerum opiniones", RICHARDSON, loc. cit.

He contributes to the idea of constant change in affairs and our need to be mobile and adjustable. He contributes to Adriani's description of the "three craftsmen of all things, fortune, nature and God", which should all be understood for what they were and not a source of fear and won- der - especially God, who was "not like us" and should not be superstitiously cultivated and propitiated as a projection of our own fantasies. Most of all, he contributes to Adriani's long account of the superstitious origins of religion and the need to overcome wonder and fear, "which makes children frightened of the dark", by understanding "the causes of things and the number of events". For as he explains, it is only novelties like comets and thunderstorms that frighten us, whereas the more familiar miracles of nature - such as the rising of the sun, the waxing and waning of the moon, rain, hail, frost, snow and the ever-changing colours and shapes of clouds - give us pleasure rather than fear and lead to a life of happy poverty instead of unhappy riches and political ambition. Even here Lucretius is not mentioned by name, but we know that he is present in absentia when Adriani declares that "They are indeed happy beyond measure who do not wonder at the majesty of nature because they know its causes" - paraphrasing Virgil's famous lines alluding to Lucretius, "Happy is he who has succeeded in knowing the causes of things, stamping underfoot all fear and inexorable fate".96 But 96 Ric. 811, fols. 18r-26r, discussed by VERDE, Studio, IV, 3, op. cit.

Lucretius remained as relevant to the political situation in 1497, when Adriani delivered this prolusion, as he had been two years ear- lier. It was in early November 1497 that a student of Adriani's de- scribed the situation in Florence exactly as the free-for-all that Adria- ni had quoted Lucretius to describe in 1495: in the city, Roberto Ac- ciaiuoli wrote, ravaged by discord, war, famine and plague, "we live as we please".97 This was also the context of Bartolomeo Scala's long 40-page poem On trees which he was in the middle of writing when he died in July 1497, to be succeeded as first chancel- lor by Adriani early the next year. As its title suggests, this is not his lost Lucretian poem De rebus naturalibus that Michele Verino was shown in the 1480s; instead, it is an agriculturalist poem influenced by Theophrastus and the changing direction of Florentine human- ism from philology towards empirical science.98 For this reason, it is easy to. overlook its debt to Lucretius and Epicurus in its descrip- tion of primitivism and the growth of civilisation.

GODMAN, op. cit. (see note 90), pp. 199-200. It is interesting that in the prolu- sion to his 1495-6 lectures, Adriani refers to poems praising trees as a "novum genus laudis" (Ric. 811, fols. 10v-1 ir).

So without seeking harm, "we waged unremitting and continual war with wild animals", eating their flesh and their blood ("flesh was stored under flesh and our blood is brut- ish blood").100 Fire provided by Vulcan, or by lightning hurled down by Jupiter, transformed life by the many different uses to which it was put, thanks to the woods that contain fire - and Scala went on to describe the many domestic and sacral uses to which fire and trees were put, including the provision of more and cheaper printed books.101 As in De rerum natura, however, technological 99 De arboribus, ed. BROWN, Op. cit.

Although Ovid (Met. 1.19) describes the conflict between the elements, his ensuing Golden Age is not Scala's model (cf. note 50 above), whereas Lucretius, though critical of old myths about conflict between the elements (and of Jupiter's role) and admitting that there is no "simplex et recta" explanation of the solstices, the seasons and later evolution, does refer to the semina of the four elements as contributing to change, De rer.nat V, 380-415 (cf.

In both poems, fear of death is a predominant theme, based on the reality of these events. But Scala's description of how people were reduced by famine to "eating grasses" and even "devouring unclean food" be- fore collapsing by the wayside serves to demonstrate the re-brutalisa- tion that accompanied the growing sophistication of men's lives.102 Despite the strange ending of the poem, perhaps reflecting Scala's own impending death, we can see how effectively it grounds the primitivist themes of his earlier writings in the context of Florence at the time he was writing. The same is true of the paintings by Piero di Cosimo that Erwin Panofsky sixty years ago associated with Lucretius's account of evo- lution, consisting of two panels depicting a primitive hunt and an- other panel depicting a forest fire. Associating these panels with other cycles of paintings, especially the Vulcan series, Panofsky com- mented on Piero di Cosimo's "extraordinary preoccupation with the circumstances and emotions of primordial existence", which is "practically ubiquitous in his paintings, regardless of subject, patron and destination." 103 Although the Hunt panels follow Lucretius most accurately, with their portrayal of men and animals slaughter- ing for self-defence and being slaughtered before both are eventually domesticated, the Forest Fire also shows the fear implied by the advance of civilisation and domestication (Figs. 7-9), while other paint- ings - for example, The Battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs in the Na- tional Gallery in London - demonstrate an emotional narrowing of the gap between humans and animals that goes beyond the strictly 102 Ibid., p. 431, 11. 229-240: "[...] ab herbis Nutrimenta petunt [...] quaecumque immunda vorantur [...].

So although it is now suggested, in reaction to Panofsky's earlier views, that only the Hunt panels follow Lucretius with any accuracy and that it is misleading to ascribe to the se- ries as a whole a political or ideological meaning,'05 it is surely impos- sible to interpret them without referring to the cultural context we have been exploring. Since they were produced in the same period as Adriani's lectures and Scala's poem On Trees, their interest in prim- itivism cannot be confined to the details of a single passage or text; and although Vasari found Piero's paintings of animals and his land- scapes with trees and caves "bizarre" and his way of life "more bes- tial than human" (in not pruning his garden and eating only hard- boiled eggs, which he cooked fifty at a time), we can with hindsight see that they may well have reflected belief in a natural life-style - such as Epicurus advocated - that later critics have failed to under- stand. 106 Nor was interest in primitivism and wild landscapes confined to Piero di Cosimo at this time. Filippino Lippi, too, exhibited the same invention and "strange fancies" that Vasari found in Piero - as can be seen in his Wounded Centaur in Christ Church, Oxford. For although the ostensible subject of the painting is the Centaur's 104 Illustrated in FERMOR, op. cit.

The Battle of the Centaurs was based on Ovid and Lucian, who suggested the subject of a female Centaur lying on some soft grass, suckling her young, as a daring experiment (Lucian, Satirical Sketches, tr. P. TURNER, Bloomington, 1990, p. 31). 105 By FERMOR, op. cit. (see note 103), pp. 77-81, and note 106 following. 106 GIoRGIo VASARI, Le vite de' piii eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori, ed.

Fermor, for instance, concludes (P. 195) that it is "both misleading and a gross over-simplication" to see Piero's landscapes as reflections of his own interests and "supposedly primitive nature". 53</page><page sequence="50">ALISON BROWN wound, caused by Cupid's arrow, the almost incidental and obscure detail of his young family in a cave in the distant hillside points to its probable meaning: that (to quote Jonathan Nelson) "the painful ar- row of love can lead even a half animal to establish a family, the basis of civilization" (Figs. 11, 12). Like Piero di Cosimo's Battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs, this domestic scene may have been inspired by Lucian but it also reflects Lucretius's account of civilisation in which it was the sight of their offspring that first helped to soften the human race.107 Leonardo da Vinci was another Florentine artist who narrowed the evolutionary gap between men and animals in his paintings, especially in his grotesque paintings of faces and his detailed studies of plants, animals and storms. Of all his drawings of the forces of nature, vortices and storms, his "Hurricane over Horsemen and Trees" has been called the most extraordinary in the elements of fan- tasy that combine with "visionary naturalism".108 Describing what he calls the "Epicurean atomism" of Leonardo's studies of motion, drawn by watching atoms of dust in the circular rays of the sun, Martin Kemp thinks Isidore of Seville a more likely source for these studies than Lucretius. Yet Lucretius is far more evocative in de- scribing how "the sun's rays [...] pour their light through a dark room", enabling us to see "many minute particles mingling in many 107 See J. K.

The Botticelli painting known as "Camilla [or Pallas] and the Centaur does not belong to this primitivist tradition but to the moral platonising tradition associated with Lo- renzo il Magnifico's circle that exemplified Camilla (or Pallas) as a moral restraint on our bestial instincts; although inventoried in Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's palace in 1496, it was not securely fixed there and may, John Shearman suggests, "hang as a trophy [...] thus painted for Lorenzo il Magnifico after all" ("The Collections of the Younger Branch of the Medici", The Burlington Magazine 117, 1975, pp. 17-19, 21). 108 By M.

This is even more true of his extraordinary description of nature's forces, more than a hundred lines describing how "the vortex of wind enwraps itself in clouds [...] vomiting forth a prodigious violence of whirlwind and storm", which could have provided a powerful source of images for Leonardo's equally dramatic drawings of whirlwinds and storms.'09 We do not know whether Leonardo read Lucretius or whether he was motivated by Lucretius's desire to remove people's terror of the gods, but the two men certainly shared the same desire to penetrate the natural laws underlying the phenomena men attrib- uted to the gods, studying storms in great detail in order to explain them scientifically. We also know from Leonardo's fables how closely the anthropomorphic subjects of his paintings reflect his own deeply-felt attitude to nature. These fables and prophecies illustrate many of the "clusters of ideas" we have been exploring as aspects of Florentine primitivism, encouraged - like the new thinking we have been investigating - by the discoveries of new worlds and political change, as well as by the apocalyptic ideas that circulated towards the end of the century. So Leonardo, too, described men as bestial and cannibalistic in eating not only animals but their own kind, chasing and eating men "on the islands of others": "does not nature produce enough simple [veg- etarian] things for you to satisfy yourself?" He also talked about trees anthropomorphically, describing nuts, olives, acorns, and chestnuts as their offspring, who were "snatched by cruel thrashings from the very arms of their mothers and flung on the ground, crushed", and how the walnut-trees who had done their best would be the most beaten - a notion that recalls Scala's description, in his poem On trees, of the walnut tree in his garden close to the road as a prey to "boys who attacked the pregnant mother and her foetus and happily ran off with the nuts they had shaken down"."0 And 109 M.

It is not my argument that all these artists necessarily read Lucre- tius but rather that the cultural climate after 1494 encouraged the diffusion of his Epicurean naturalism. After Marcello Adriani had delivered his annual inaugural lectures - proclaiming that Florence in the mid-90s was like "that first newness of the world" when, as Lucretius had described, men used no laws and only the toughest survived, keeping "for himself the spoils that fortune offered" - these ideas were widely disseminated among the populace. For in this highly vocal society that exchanged ideas in piazzas, in shops and on street corners, non-Latinists and even the illiterate could have picked up their gist and understood their relevance to the present situation. l13 One Florentine who was certainly influenced by these ideas was Niccolo Machiavelli.

He also transcribed a copy of Lucretius, whose influence on his thinking is only now beginning to be recognised - though without reference to fifteenth-century precedents.1"4 From the perspective of the fifteenth century, we can now see how much both Machiavelli's attitude to religion and his view of natural evolution owed to the developments we have been discussing. We know from his role in Luigi Guicciardini's dialogue, "On free will", that Machiavelli was regarded as a sceptic who systemati- cally ran circles round his Christian disputants - or, as Luigi ex- plained to his brother Francesco in 1533, as "someone who found it difficult to believe the things that had to be believed, not to men- tion those to be made fun of"."5 Although the dialogue may exag- gerate Machiavelli's position as a non-believer, there is sufficient evi- dence in his own writings to suggest that he adopted what John Najemy has called "a comparative and almost anthropological approach to religion". Even if his approach was not Lucretius's - being more interested in religion for its political value to rulers than as a bogey from whose stranglehold men needed to be liberated - like Lucre- tius, he recognised that the power of religion was based on fear and reflected the social customs of the people who believed in it.116 It was this fear that made religion a useful tool in the hands 114 The manuscript is Biblioteca Vaticana, MS.

The same is true of the power they attributed to fortune, whose impetus we are powerless to deflect without God's dispensation, as Scala put it, Machiavelli agreeing that such was the power of fortune and God that men were incapable of changing the affairs of the world through their prudence, "indeed they have no remedy at all", especially in the Italy of his day, "which is a country without banks and without any defence": hence fortune's power as "arbiter of half of our actions"."18 Their definition of justice was also closely derived from Lucretius. Although Polybius is usually cited as the MACHIAVELLI, Discorsi 1, 11, ed. BERTELLI, op. cit. (see note 79), pp. 160-163: "timore di Dio"; I, 12, ed.

(see note 114), (p. 667), who suggests that here Machiavelli may have been inspired by Lucretius's critique of the emotions. 117 Discorsi,, 1,I1, ed. S. BERTELLI, op. cit. (see note 79), p. 161; I principe, ch. 17, ibid. "il timore &amp; tenuto da una paura di pena che non ti abbandona mai". CUTINELLI-RtNDINA (op. cit.

(see note 114), pp. 667-676. Cutinelli-Rendina reminds us that other sources like Polybius and Averroes contributed to Machiavelli's religion as well as Lucre- tius, and that apart from the contribution of these ancient materialists and more modern philosophers, it reflected "un atteggiamento pia propriamente personale, meno cultural- mente mediato", CUTINELLI-RtNDINA, op. cit. (see note 114), pp. 165 notes 273 and 271, the latter being equally true of Bartolomeo Scala's attitude to religion. 118 MACHIAVELLI, II Principe, ch. 25, ed. BERTELLI, op. cit. (see note 79), pp. 98-99: "le cose del mondo sieno in modo governate dalla fortuna e da Dio, che gli uomini con la pru- denzia loro non possino correggerle, anzi non vi abbino rimedio alcuno [...] iudico potere esser vero che la fortuna sia arbitra della meta delle azioni nostre [...].

POLYBIUS, Hist., VI. 5. 5-6.

Here too, Machiavelli, like Scala, adopted a more positive at- titude to animals and their merits than was traditional. He most fa- mously broke with tradition in admiring the bestial qualities of the centaur Chiron in The Prince, which, as Ezio Raimondi has already pointed out, deserts the Platonic-Christian approach to the centaur myth for Xenophon and a "taste for the primitive and the 'savage' of a broadly Lucretian inspiration".'22 But "the beast" that the prince must know how to use is very different from the animals in his fable The Golden Ass who are "closer friends" to Nature and more phi- lanthropic to each other than man is. They can hardly represent a nostalgic longing for a lost Golden Age which would have been in- consistent with Machiavelli's primitivism, but equally they are surely more than "zoomorphic projections" of purely human attitudes as has been suggested.'23 Some themes are specifically Lucretian - such as man alone being born nude and helpless, his life beginning in tears - while others reflect the growing interest in the natural be- haviour of animals, based on observations that often highlight animals' superior life-skills.124 The argument that unlike men, animals know without instruction what food is good or bad for them, for instance, recurs in an unpublished dialogue by Luigi Guicciardini, "On bees and spiders", which is full of observations based on personal 122 E.

This new thinking was stimulated by travel and exploration as well as by the re-discovery of unfamiliar classical texts. Nearly all the ideas that Lucretius and Epicurus helped to re-introduce in the fifteenth century - the chance creation of the world, the absence of an after-life, an all-powerful Nature that generated and destroyed, evolution - conflicted directly with the prevailing religious and po- litical orthodoxy. This makes them difficult to detect, hence the need to approach them indirectly, through their "relevance to contempo- rary concerns" instead of through the texts alone. There are of course multiple sources for many of these ideas, since humanists borrowed promiscuously from a wide range of available sources. Man's origin was discussed by nearly all ancient writers and, as we have seen, words and phrases were borrowed from authors whose overall argu- ment was very different from that of the text in which they were being quoted. So in citing Lucretius and Epicurus so often, I am aware they are not the only possible sources for the ideas I have been discussing. Nevertheless, they are distinctive for the combination of ideas they express, and they are quoted in remarkably consistent way within a relevant context, as we have seen. These two writers are also distinctive as members of a group of philosophers influenced by the atomist Democritus, the philosopher who began to be in vogue at the end of this period. Sharing what has been called a "hard" and technological approach to primitivism, they contrast strikingly with writers like Plato and Aristotle who en- visage a higher, more intellectual end for human development. From this point of view, the clusters of ideas I have been discussing all be- long to the Democritan tradition and contrast with the Aristotelian and neoplatonic philosophy favoured by the ruling elite in Florence before 1494. This, too, gives them a cultural significance that goes 125 Ibid., VIII, 11. 46-8, ed.

The extent to which they formed a counter-tradition in Florence can be seen from their brief flowering in the later 1490s, when they became the prevailing ideol- ogy of the new republican regime - only to be suppressed when the restored Mediceans reverted to the neoplatonic Golden Age ideol- ogy that Lorenzo il Magnifico had favoured. 126 Undervalued because of their danger and because they enjoyed such a brief flowering, the ideas I have been discussing nevertheless helped to transform Re- naissance thinking in unacknowledged ways. They encouraged a new anthropological and functional view of religion that influenced not only Machiavelli but also later thinkers like Hobbes, thereby re- ducing the role of the divine in temporal life. They emphasised the importance of chance and fortune in life, encouraging later atomism. Most of all, they encouraged a new view of nature as a dynamic and "immense physical machine": ideas that all provided an important bridge to later revolutionary thinking about the universe as well as a more protean view of man. 126 On Golden Age mythology (already being revived by Piero Soderini as life-long Head of State from 1502), see H. BUTTERS, "Piero Soderini and the Golden Age", Italian Studies 33, 1978, pp. 56-71), see note 87 above.
