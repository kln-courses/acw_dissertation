<plain_text><page sequence="1">Man Meets Dog. By Konrad Z. Lorenz. [Pp. x -f 199, with numerous line drawings.] (London : Methuen &amp; Co., Ltd., 1954. 15s. net.) The author gives such a charming and entertaining account of his life -long experiences with dogs - and cats - as to disarm criticism. It is well to remem- ber, therefore, that his theory of the jackal ancestry of many breeds of dogs receives little or no support from anatomical or palaeontological evidence and is based almost entirely on his frankly anthropomorphic interpretation of their behaviour. The first chapter 4 4 How it may have started," whilst admittedly a fable, is used as a basis for the development of this theory, but few authorities will agree with the statement that " it is quite certain that the northern wolf is not the ancestor of most of our domestic dogs as was formerly believed." The author is on much firmer ground when he proceeds to a consideration of canine personalities and especially training and relations between dogs and their masters. There is also good practical advice on choosing a dog and all knowledgeable dog- owners will agree with his opinion that a bitch is preferable to a male dog in points of character. A few of the later chapters are concerned with cats, a comparatively recent addition to our list of domesticated animals, which has shown remark- ably few mutations and easily reverts to the wild state. The relations between</page><page sequence="2">758 SCIENCE PROGRESS man and cat are very different from those which develop between a dog and its master, and cats rarely form personal friendships with human beings. This can be shown by taking the animal outside and letting it decide spon- taneously whether it will remain with him or go its own way. Other chapters deal with such varied topics as feline play, the fallacy of the false cat, the animal with a conscience, and fidelity and death. The book has obviously been written to meet a demand for popular accounts of animal behaviour. The author has always kept and bred dogs and cats and has collected together a number of entertaining stories and reflections accompanied by amusing line drawings. But, whilst it is of great interest as expressing the views of such a distinguished worker in the field of animal behaviour, it can hardly be considered as a serious addition to the subject.
