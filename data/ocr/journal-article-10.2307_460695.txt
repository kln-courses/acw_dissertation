<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZOLA AND BUSNACH: THE TEMPTATION OF THE STAGE By Martin Kanes WHAT COULD have possessed Zola to let a writer of vaudevilles tamper with his novels? Andre Antoine asked himself the ques? tion in his journal the day after the dismal failure of Germinal, and we still wonder about it today. Very little is known about Busnach, except that he was one of the directors of the Athenee theater, and the author of such items as Ali-Baba and Froufrou. Did Zola really think this theatri? cal butterfly was capable of converting Germinal, or any other novel for that matter, into a play?1 Let us not judge him by his boulevard reputa- tion alone. Sarah Bernhardt called him the wittiest man in Paris, no mean compliment com? ing from her.2 He possessed the gift?or burden? of extreme sensitivity, and a line from one of his letters to Zola, "Je suis trop votre collaborateur et pas assez votre ami" might serve as epigraph to their relationship. Moreover, Zola had burned himself at the sputtering limelight of the Boule? vard des Italiens with Les Heritiers Rabourdin and Le Bouton de rose; why should he not have welcomed the cooperation of a man who knew his business well? Despite the fact that there is a mass of available material on this collaboration? material which throws much light upon Zola's critical and esthetic theories?there has been no real attempt to relate Zola dramaturge with Zola romancier. Relationships did nevertheless exist, as I shall indicate. In the course of their collabo? ration, Busnach wrote Zola nearly 2000 letters, and in the absence of Zola's replies, these remain our chief source of information.3 My remarks are based upon them, and upon the texts of the plays.4 The idea of making a play out of UAssommoir (the first to be adapted) was Busnach's.6 Al? though the novelist did not believe, at first, that VAssommoir could be dramatized (letter of 2 Oct. 1882), he allowed himself to be convinced, and ended by cooperating considerably. UAs? sommoir reached the boards of the Ambigu on 19 January 1879 and was a success. Zola had many reservations about the practical problems of turning novels into plays, and had written as much apropos of La Dame aux camelias: "D'ordinaire, lorsqu'un ecrivain tire une piece d'un roman, c'est le roman qui reste superieur."6 The Busnach correspondence contra- dicts the popular notion that Zola used the vaudeville writer for window-dressing. Except in the case of Germinal, Busnach usually had to persuade Zola to permit a play to be staged.7 It should be noted, however, that Zola rarely questioned whether a novel should be dramatized, though he invariably wondered if it could be emciently done. Busnach brought no such hesitations to the partnership, but rather looked upon it as a great and important endeavor: "Avec vous," he wrote on 1 February 1882, "je fais de l'art. Avec les autres je fais du metier." This was pure self- delusion, yet a human enough reaction to associa? tion with the great novelist. It did not blind him to the fact that the very basis of the partnership was his qualification of "metier": a sense of staging, a feeling for dramatic movement, and above all a thorough familiarity with the theatrical world. He rightly insisted that his 1 The material in this paper was presented briefly at the Modern Language Association Meeting in Philadelphia in December 1960. All quotations from the works of Zola are taken from the (Euvres completes, ed. Maurice Le Blond, 50 vols. (Paris, 1927-29). William Busnach was born on 7 March 1832 and died on 20 January 1907. He came of a North Afri- can family of some artistic pretentions, related to the illustri- ous Halevy family. Like many beginning men of letters, he first held a government position, but then was able to sup? port himself by his stage productions alone. He eventually became director of the Theatre de PAthene'e, where many of his pieces were staged. His personal production, mostly boulevard comedies and musical revues, was vast. A factual (although somewhat incomplete) account of his collaboration with Zola can be found in the unpublished dissertation (Yale, 1951) by Lawson A. Carter, "Zola and the Theater." 2 S.

Busnach, Trois Pieces tire'es des romans et prScSdees chacune d'une preface de Emile Zola, Paris: Charpentier, 1884). The censor's manuscript of Germinal is now in the Archives na- tionales, serie F18, no. 981. Le Ventre de Paris was staged in 1887, but I have been unable to locate a manuscript. La BUe humaine was written shortly after the publication of the novel, and was re-worked intermittently as late as 1900. It was never staged and its manuscript is consequently not on deposit at the Archives nationales. 6 Details can be found in L. Deffoux, La Publication de VAssommoir (Paris, 1931), pp. 115-125. 6 NosAuteurs dramatiques, "Alexandre Dumas fils," p. 139. 7 There are frequent complaints by Busnach about Zola's lack of enthusiasm. Apropos of La BUe humaine, for example, he wrote, "Vous n'avez jamais cru a la piece." (24513/643). 109</page><page sequence="2">110 Zola and Busnach views on matters of production be respected, and once threatened to abandon VAssommoir if Zola continued to insist upon an unsuitable actress for the part of Gervaise (letter of 16 Nov. 1877). Once the decision to write a play had been taken a strict procedure was followed. Busnach prepared for Zola a list of tableaux which were to make up the play. The word "tableaux," as they used it, meant a specific decor, not neces- sarily a scene or an act. A great deal of impor? tance was attached to the tableaux, each of which was given an identifying title. In the case of VAssommoir j we find four lists of from seven to twelve tableaux arranged in varying order. The titles enable us to see at a glance the general structure of the play (I am quoting from the original twelve-tableau version): "L'Hotel Bon- cceur, Devant l'Assommoir, Le Moulin d'argent, La Maison en construction, Chez Gervaise, La F6te de la Blanchisseuse, La Forge, LTnt6rieur des Goujet, l'Assommoir, La Mansarde de Ger? vaise, La Boutique de confiserie and Le Boule- vard Rochechouart."8 These lists reflect the capital fact that the plays were conceived from the very beginning as a series of dicors. They are merely titles; they contain no indication of plot nor any discussion of characterization. The list of tableaux, once agreed upon, was followed by the scenario. This, as far as can be gathered (none is currently available, if any still exist), was a manuscript succinctly describing the action of each tableau. That it contained nothing beyond the mere outline of plot is made clear by Busnach's remark, in sending the scenario of La Bete humaine to Zola: "Vous y mettez les developpements de theories. Je n'y ai mis que l'action succincte ..." (24513/338). Only when this scenario was completed (Bus? nach once referred to it as the "tableaux scenari- otes" [24514/714]) did the writing of the play begin. It was at this late stage that questions of characterization arose. Busnach wrote the tab? leaux, working from the scenario, and sent Zola a first version upon which the novelist would make corrections and alterations. "II faudra que du 1* au 31 7bre vous fassiez votre travail sur le mien ..." wrote Busnach on 4 August 1883 apropos of Fot-Bouille. These tableaux were then subjected to further comments by Busnach, and were rewritten until Zola was satisfied. Oc? casionally, the novelist would reserve for himself a tableau that he felt to be especially important; sometimes Busnach would run into difficulties and ask Zola to do a tableau which he could not handle (as, for example, the tableau of La Maison en construction in VAssommoir [24515/251], or a tender scene between Nana and Georges Hugon [24513/637]). The one exception to this proce- dure was Germinal, where Zola wrote the text from their common scenario and submitted it to Busnach's criticism and revision. Insofar as staging was concerned, Busnach took charge (it was a very important factor in their relation? ship), with Zola coming to pay visits from time to time.9 Those who know Zola, and know his methods, feel themselves on familiar ground here. Lists, plans, scenarios?all this is strikingly reminiscent of the famous dossiers he drew up for his novels. A letter of 25 July 1877 establishes beyond all doubt that their system was specifically set up by Zola, and was not a haphazard method.10 These were the mechanics of their procedure. They did not solve the inevitable problems of creative writing. Busnach, when faced with the actual work of composition, remained rather timid: "... je crois qu'il ne faut pas changer trop au roman ni introduire des personnages inconnus. Cela 6tonne le spectateur. Un drame tire d'un roman a besoin de moins de cohesion qu'une piece ordinaire" (letter of 17 July 1877). This startling theory, that the public's knowledge of a novel can bolster up a loosely-knit play, can be explained only by Busnach's awestruck re? spect for Zola. His reticence before the sanctity of the book sometimes left him perplexed when the novel's events did not fit the requirements of the stage. A good example is the unspecified fate of Auguste Lantier in UAssommoir: "Mais Lantier," Busnach writes, "comment faire . . . a moins d'inventer?" (letter of 25 July 1877); or the problem of the slow, undramatic decline of the Coupeau household: "II manque pourtant, au point de vue du the'atre, une peripetie au milieu de la piece. Comment diable la trouver. Je reponds du commencement et de la fin. C'est le milieu qui m'effraie,, (letter of 17 July 1877). It was in answer to these uncertainties that Zola wrote the well-known letter of 19 August 1877, published in the first volume of the correspond? ence. He altered the plot of the novel and turned Gervaise's struggle with her destiny into a vul? gar washerwoman's quarrel, in which Virginie 8 Letter of 30 July 1877. These lists were usually part of the correspondence, although certain allusions by Busnach indicate that the plays, like Zola's novels, each had a dossier. ? In an article in defense of Germinal, published in the Figaro for 25 April 1888, and reproduced in the volume of Milanges, Zola declared that he assumed an increasing share of the work as the collaboration proceeded. The letters indi? cate that this linear development was not exactly accurate; moreover, mere quantity of work does not necessarily indi? cate the proportion of creative effort involved. 10 "Dans ce que vous demandez qu'on fasse, c'est-a-dire dans une se"rie de tableaux ..."

Busnach, when he read Zola's proposal, fairly crowed: "Mais ce qui me plalt, c'est que la pifece consiste en une conspira- tion de Virginie maltresse de Lantier contre Gervaise" (24513/16). He himself would not have dared to make such a departure. Such slashing at the situation of the novel would be inexplicable, especially in the light of Zola's published views on adaptations, were it not for the important fact that Zola and Busnach did not regard the plays as mere re-workings of the novels. The primary lists of tableaux by title were the only documents based upon the original novels and these were little more than labels. They reduced the novel to a series of visual ele? ments (preserving the more striking milieux of the novel and thus satisfying Busnach's anxiety about the public's familiarity), and they provided the basis for a plot. It was at this point, usually, that the necessary reductions took place. Pot- Bouille, for example, became entirely the story of Berthe's marriage to Auguste Vabre and her subsequent affair with Octave Mouret; and as for Nana, Busnach wrote that "La piece est dans les Hugon et les Muffat" (24513/468). It was at this point, too, that Busnach introduced such new departures as he did make, chiefly comic relief. Busnach was a clever writer of vaudevilles and comedies, and he was quite sensitive to the demands of boulevard audiences. He wrote to Zola, in connection with Nana, that his comedy was intended to "sauver le c6te cru de vos premieres situations" (24514/392), and he admittedly had a point. He was particularly successful with Pot-Bouille where his second-act scene at Mme Josserand's reception attained moments of first-rate satirical comedy. But once the tableaux were established the men made practically no further references to the novels except for the relatively mechanical copying of appropriate dialogue. Depending upon the decisions made with regard to the tableaux, subsequent divergencies ranged from the simple alteration of a name (Duveyrier of Pot-Bouille becomes Dulaurier) to wholesale alteration of characterization. Most radical, perhaps, was the case of Etienne Lantier in Germinal. There was no time in the play for the slow, delicate relationship between him and Catherine Maheu. The hero's exasperated reluctance to make love to her had to be explained by the unsatisfactory introduction of a woman in his past, "Ah," he says in an aside, "que n'ai-je donc le courage de chasser le souvenir de l'autre!" Nor was there time for Etienne's socialist education. He and Souvarine meet as old comrades, thus avoiding the theorizing of the novel. The famous "Germi? nal" speech is moved from the last paragraph of the novel to the third tableau of the play? before the strike. This immediately transforms Etienne into a far-seeing, purposeful leader, and if the strike fails, the implication is that the failure was due to causes beyond his control. He can even say to Souvarine, discussing the failure, "Viens, ne parlons plus de ces choses, tu ne me comprendrais pas."11 As a matter of fact, the plays demonstrate consistent difnculty in the handling of characterization. Human relation? ships were never Zola's strong point (and Bus? nach could hardly have helped much here). On stage, this deficiency in Zola's art became even more obvious, for here, human relationships and characterizations were direct, and carried di? rectly by dialogue. The articulations, the points of contact between protagonists tended therefore to be stiff and awkward. In Germinal, for ex? ample, we hear Chaval speaking of the day when the miners will take their revenge: "Sacre ton- nerre! Si ce jour-la arrivait, c'est moi qui enver- rais promener ce vendu de Dansaert, le maitre- porion; et le petit Negrel done, cet ingenieur de quatre sous, qui vous bouscule parce qu'il est le neveu de monsieur Hennebeau!" Whereupon these three men, now properly identified by demonstrative adjectives and definite articles, come on stage. The transparent device is used in all the plays and always with the same lack of finesse. It is the stage equivalent of Zola's diffi- culty with dialogue, for with the exception of comic banter, Busnach proved to be of little help here.12 And it is astonishing to see the liberties that Zola permitted Busnach to take with a host of lesser characters. What can one say to his creation of a sub-plot in UAssommoir in which Mes-Bottes, Bec-Sale, and Bibi-la-Grillade turn into three drinking clowns?especially when the first becomes a kind of Salvation Army convert in the end? And what could have possessed him (here again Antoine's query pops into mind) to turn La Mouquette of Germinal into a veritable burlesque queen complete with song-and-dance 11 Nevertheless, Zola, in his running battle with Albert Wolff over Germinal, could flatly state: "Que ceux qui ont bien voulu lire mon roman aillent voir le drame; et ils recon- naitront au passage des pages entieres. De mes cinq ceuvres, adapte"es par Busnach, celle-ci est celle qui a e"te* le plus respecte"e. Malgre* ce qu'on en a dit, pas une des situations, pas un des personnages employe*es n'a e"te* change* dans son ensemble" (Milanges, "Germinal," p. 144). 12 Zola's well-known difficulty with dialogue explains one of his chief demands upon Busnach. A study of the dialogue of Germinal, almost exclusively Zola's product, might shed some light on his use of the "style indirect libre" in the novels.</page><page sequence="4">112 Zola and Busnach routine in the scene of the Ducasse? These characters turned out, in the end, to be as super? ficial as Scribe's, but because they were "aver? age" rather than because they were false. In a typical Zola-Busnach adaptation, characters were nothing more than part of the decor; they were designed to fit into the stage situation as easily as the furniture. Nor is this surprising when one recalls that the characterization was the last item considered by the two men; after plot and long after decor. The difficulties in adapting the characters to the stage and the general lack of success with which the process was carried off, bring us to the essence of what Zola was trying to do. For al? though the plays were considered by many to be only second-rate melodrama, they nevertheless had an impact that assured their popularity all over Europe where they were being revived as late as 1927?and even more recently, used as the basis for film adaptations.13 The reason for this, of course, was that Zola was aiming, and pushing Busnach, toward a set of very specific criteria which he had defined several times, and which can be easily deduced from the plays themselves. First and foremost was the over-riding im- portance of the decor. I have already pointed out the exclusive preoccupation with d?cor that characterized the early stages of planning these plays. It was an easy trap to fall into; for it was always assumed by the two men, and for reasons that will be apparent, that the basic situation could merely be lifted wholesale from the book. True, such surgery rarely succeeded in toto, but this was the spirit in which the men approached the task of stage adaptation. Completely mesmerized by the question of tableaux, they failed to realize, perhaps, that "life" is not "art." One reads, for example, a letter in which Busnach anxiously consults with Zola about the exact spot of the Boulevard Rochechouart where certain scenes of UAssommoir take place.14 As the years went by, and play succeeded play, this preoc? cupation seemed to grow stronger. UAssommoir had utilized real soap and hot water in the wash- house scene; Nana presented the suicide of Muffat and his wife in a house that burned down in full view of the audience.16 It reached a cul- mination in the tenth tableau of Germinal in which the collapse of the Voreux mine was staged. We get a view of the buildings as the miners emerge and flee hysterically into the sur- rounding woods. Crowds rush onstage. The earth begins to shake. I quote from the stage directions: "A partir de ce moment, on entend de sourds eboulements interieurs. Les batiments de la fosse ne bougent pas encore. La foule a recule et elle fait le cercle devant le Voreux, dans une attente terrifiee" (here the mine achieves some? thing like the anthropomorphic existence it has in the novel). "A ce moment le premier ecroule- ment a lieu. Le hangar du criblage oscille et se brise. La salle de recette et la salle de la machine se fendent, tout le mur de la facade s'abat, et, par la breche, on apercoit la bouche du puits et la machine. La foule pousse un cri d'epouvante." As Hennebeau swears vengeance on the saboteur, Souvarine steps from the crowd, runs into the collapsing buildings, and is swallowed up with them as they sink into the ground.16 This kind of staging made heavy demands upon the Chatelet, then one of the most modern theaters in Paris. Germinal, when it was finally staged in 1888, was a sensation of decor. Yet the same techniques of realism a outrance had been used by Zola and Busnach ever since UAssom- moir in 1879?and that was almost ten years before the Theatre libre opened. For example, the scene about which Busnach was so anxious? the Assommoir on the Boulevard Rochechouart ?is described in the stage directions as follows: La rue des Poissonniers, au coin du boulevard Rochechouart. A gauche 1'Assommoir du pere Co- lombe. A droite, la barriere. Douaniers a la grille. . . . Au lever du rideau, la scene est vide. II fait petit jour. Des boutiques viennent d'ouvrir, eclairees par les reflets rougeatres du gaz. Un garcon pose devant 1'Assommoir deux tables et quatre chaises en fer. Un macon parait a gauche et traverse le th6atre, en souffiant dans ses doigts. II a un demi-pain sous le bras. Puis, on en voit plusieurs. Peu a peu, des ouvriers descendent a leur travail, des serruriers ayant des bourgerons bleus, des peintres avec des paletots sous lesquels passent des blouses blanches. Un ouv- rier s'arrete, allume sa pipe et s'en va. Le jour a augment6, les lumieres des boutiques se sont 6teintes. Bibi-la-Grillade et Bec-Sale entrent au milieu du flot des ouvriers, qui devient plus rare.17 The staging of Germinal responded to the same desire for absolute, realistic fidelity that char- acterizes the stage directions for U Assommoir, 13 In the context of the times, these productions were per? haps not the dismal failures adverse criticism made them out to be. In a letter of 23 July 1883 (24514/202), Busnach quotes a remark of Sarah Bernhardt, who was interested in playing the Mme Jusserand of Pot-Bouille: "Depuis quatre ans il n'y a eu que votre collaboration avec Zola qui ait fait de l'argent a rAmbigu." 14 Nouv. acq. fr. 24514/318. The responsibility for the decor was largely Busnach's, although Zola specified, by controlling the choice of tableaux, what they were to be. 16 For contemporary critical reactions to these spectacular stagings, see Carter, op. cit., p. 157. 16 Archives nationales F18, no. 981; tableau 10: "L'Ecroule- ment du Voreux." 17 Trois pieces, "UAssommoir," p. 65.</page><page sequence="5">Martin Kanes 113 but it aroused more of a reaction because of its unusual and dramatic locations. Zola himself had written, years before, "Comment ne sent-on pas tout Pinter?t qu'un decor exact ajoute a l'action? Un decor exact, un salon par exemple avec ses meubles, ses jardinieres, ses bibelots, pose tout de suite une situation, dit le monde ou l'on est, raconte les habitudes des personnages." He ar- rived at the necessity of such decors, he wrote, by beginning with the assumption that the char? acters were "en chair et en os," and not card- board puppets a la Scribe.18 Nevertheless, when Germinal was produced at the Chatelet, Albert Wolfl could still take exception to the elaborate staging. Zola, in his article of reply, justifiably declared himself "stupefie" at Wolfl's objec? tions.19 Moreover, he revealed that "... Germi? nal n'avait d'abord que neuf tableaux. Trois ont ete ajoutes pour la machinerie, lorsque le Chatelet a du jouer la piece" [my italics].20 One could hardly go further in the exploitation of decor! Parallel to the use of elaborate machinery and realistic furnishings on stage went the elimina? tion of painted canvas except for backdrops. The nineteenth-century French stage was still plagued by the classical convention of painting on canvas all items not physically employed by the actors. Zola's and Busnach's innovation, made with their first production, consisted in completely furnishing the stage, regardless of whether all the objects were to be used or not. Zola was quite insistent on this point, and wrote emphatically on it: "Ainsi, on soutient cette these que seuls les meubles ou les objets qui servent comme accessoires devraient ?tre reels; il f audrait peindre les autres dans le decor. . . . En eflet, ce n'est pas du theatre, si l'on continue a vouloir regarder le theatre comme le triomphe quand meme de la convention."21 Most important, perhaps, was the use of mov? ing masses of supporting actors, rather than the traditional immobile "figurants." The stage di? rections for the second act of U Assommoir, which I have already quoted, amply illustrate the point. The movement of crowds in that act was almost inevitable, since it took place at a busy inter- section. It is perhaps more interesting to observe that, whenever possible, Zola and Busnach pro? vided for an "echappee"?an opening of interior decor onto an outside scene where crowds in movement are visible. Thus the fifth tableau of VAssommoir provides for a view into a street beyond the construction area of the Lariboisiere hospital where Coupeau is working; the sixth tableau of the play, "La Fete de Gervaise" shows, through the open door of her laundry, the passers-by in the rue de la Goutte-d'Or; the same is true of the seventh tableau, "L'Assommoir."22 The third tableau of Pot-Bouille, showing the Vabre drapery shop, naturally has a view through the window onto the street where one sees traffic going by;23 the drawing room of Nana's mansion has large windows opening onto the Avenue de Villiers.24 Finally, one might note that Rasseneur's tavern, in Germinal (as well as the interior of the Maheu house) had such "echappees."25 Not only did these scenes provide movement and color, and consequently "real? ism"; they also constituted the "scenes popu- laires" which Zola demanded from the very beginning (letter of 17 July 1877), and which were in some ways just as revolutionary. In short, the techniques employed by Zola and Busnach, beginning with UAssommoir in 1879 and ending with Germinal in 1888, sound very much like the modernization campaign waged by Antoine; yet all the plays except for the last had been pro? duced by the time the Theatre libre opened in 1887. Was Antoine familiar with these adapta- tions? His journal contains few allusions to them; yet there is a distinct possibility that Antoine, who pointed to the German theater as his source of inspiration, actually picked up his ideas a lot closer to home than he was willing to admit. The real extent of his debt is far from settled, and his great contribution to the French stage may, in the light of these productions, finally turn out to be more a matter of repertory than of technique. More important, of course, than the external history of the theater, is the question of the relationship, if any, between the writing of novels and the writing of plays. Between 1876 and 1890, Zola expended vast amounts of time and energy upon these productions, an expendi- ture which simply cannot be ignored in any com? plete account of his art. It appears from the cor? respondence that Zola's contribution ranged from the nearly complete composition of Germinal down to almost no work at all on La Bete humaine, and this activity may?or may not? have had a bearing on the novels upon which he was concurrently working. Some curious rap- prochements can be made here. There is ample evidence, for example, that the production of 18 Le Naturalisme au theatre, "Les Decors et les acces- soires," p. 77. 19 Melanges, "Germinal," pp. 143-147. 20 Ibid., p. 147. 21 Le Naturalisme au thSdtre, "Les Decors et les acces- soires," p. 76. 22 Trois pieces, pp. 107, 122, and 148. 23 Ibid., p. 407. 24 Ibid., p. 261. 25 Archives Nationales, F18, no. 981. Third tableau: "Chez les Maheu": Sixth tableau: "Au Cabaret de Rasseneur."</page><page sequence="6">114 Zola and Busnach Madeleine at the Theatre libre and the failure of Germinal at the Chatelet had a very real effect upon his emotional attitudes and consequently upon the composition of La Bete humaine. The effect upon him was great enough to have been remarked by Edmond de Goncourt.26 Over- simplified parallels should not be drawn, but one cannot refrain from pointing out that the senti? mental sweetness and light of Le Reve was produced when the fight against the censorship of Germinal was drawing to a successful close; whereas the catastrophic doom of La BUe humaine was created under the stress and strain of its ultimate ignoble failure. In these merely temporal relationships may lie more than one clue to the emotional and intellectual atmos? phere in which specific novels were written. At the very least they help gauge the amount of time Zola actually spent on his primary task, the writ? ing of the Rougon-Macquart. But the relationship of play-writing to novel- writing went far deeper than the mere division of time between the two tasks, beyond even matters of technique. To define the relationship properly, one must go back to 1869. In the very early doc? ument "Notes generales sur la nature de l'oeu- vre," Zola had already specified the manner in which he proposed to treat his subjects: "Voir ainsi un sujet par quelques grands tableaux, quelques grands chapitres . . . au lieu de trop multiplier les scenes, en choisir un nombre re- streint."27 Here again we encounter the key word "tableaux," a visual concept applied to the tech? nique of the novel. It could?and did?lead to either the massive chapters of the Rougon-Mac? quart, or the realistic decors of the plays. Indeed, was it not perhaps this scenic aspect of the novels that first suggested to William Busnach the possibility of adaptations? And was not their method of procedure by tableaux the inevitable result of that approach? It is illuminating, in this connection, to quote the list of tableaux for La Bete humaine which Busnach submitted to the novelist on 1 November 1890: L'Impasse d'Amsterdam Le Talus de Marsiennes La gare de Rouen Chez Mr Denizet La Chambre des Roubaud La Cabane des Misard (L'Accident dans la neige) Un coin de la gare L'Accident Apres l'accident La Croix de Maufras28 The next step, according to their usual procedure, the scinario, or "tableaux scenariotes," must have been a document such as the following which is, as a matter of fact, part of the dossier of the novel: I.

La cour d'assises.29 A simple comparison of the two documents makes abundantly clear that the approach was the same in each case. If one makes allowances for the fact that the novel was altered in plot subsequent to the list quoted above, it is easy to see how the two outlines might easily have been interchanged, with the play material serving in the composition of the novel and vice versa. This is a most striking illustration of the basic attitude that lay behind Zola's sometimes contradictory statements on esthetics and the arts: he regarded all art as a single phenomenon and demanded of it the single function of reproducing "reality." He conceded to the arts only the relatively minor variations in "optique" that resulted from their 26 E. de Goncourt, Journal, ed. R. Ricatte (Monaco, 1959), xv, 105. 27 Quoted in H.

And the "optique" of the theater, its essential condition, as Zola conceived it, was the elimination of its formal characteristics as art. It had to be more "real" than real, in a way the novel never could be. In this sense, the theater was for Zola the point of arrival of the novel, and this attitude goes far toward explain- ing his repeated returns to the theater after many disappointments and failures, and despite his awareness of the great problems involved. The common approach to both novel and play furnishes, again, the justification for the adapta- tions of the novels: "Le malheur, ai-je dit, est qu'on veut mettre le theatre a part, le considerer comme d'essence absolument differente. Sans doute il a son optique. Mais ne le voit-on pas de tout temps obeir au mouvement de l'epoque? A cette heure, le decor est une consequence du besoin de realite qui nous tourmente. II est fatal que le theatre cede a cette impulsion, lorsque le roman n'est plus lui-m6me qu'une enqu&amp;te uni- versel, qu'un proces verbal dresse sur chaque fait."30 If taken far enough, such arguments led to the position that no fundamental distinc? tion existed between "stage reality" and "real reality," or, for that matter, between art and life. And, indeed, Zola's ultimate aim was to place protagonists and audience face to face in a meet? ing of drama and life. The self-justifying prefaces he wrote when UAssommoir, Pot-Bouille, and Nana were published, argue for the primary im- portance of the stage situation, for its decor and its physical presence.31 These nai've arguments are merely variations of his early theories on art, especially as expressed in the famous letter to Valabregue on "l'ecran"?theories which, one must conclude, remained uncomfortably juve- nile. But obviously, as far as the theater was concerned, there was no possibility of putting the stage "de plein-pied avec la salle" as he once said.32 That particular development was reserved to the cinema, and indeed Antoine remarked in 1927 that the sequences of extraordinarily realistic tableaux in these adaptations were the forerunners of the cinematographic techniques of the twentieth century.33 But today we expect the true "realism" of the stage to arise not from its physical techniques, but from its human truth, from the complexity and nuance of the protagonists. Together with a startling de-emphasis of decor we have come to witness the emergence of what has recently been called the "self-conscious" stage; a kind of formalization diametrically opposed to Zola's ideal.. It was a process that began, at least partially, with Copeau's "treteau nu"; the Zola- Busnach adaptations were the statement of a theatrical theory that had in many ways come too late. It is not surprising, then, that the plays should be for us of indifferent quality. Yet how pleasant it would be to resurrect a forgotten masterpiece! Between the letter of the novel and the needs of the stage (the Scylla and Charybdis of all adap- tations), this uneasy alliance of novelist and vaudevillist often lost its way in a maze of elabo? rate staging that overwhelmed the protagonists only too well. But I must return to my original question: Why Busnach? Zola himself was exasperated at the many times this question was flung at him. He spelled out his motives in the course of de- fending Germinal in the Figaro on 25 April 1888: "le desir de tenter des experiences, la necessite de certains menagements, l'espoir d'un achemine- ment vers plus de verite,} [my italics].34 The third reason was probably most basic, in that it ex? pressed his view of the theater as an extension of the novel; in the second, one is tempted to see merely a cover for his need of Busnach's technical skill. But the first reason is perhaps the subtlest of all. Why, after all, did he have to try new ex- periments in the theater when in the novel he was a master? Perhaps the answer is that Zola did not feel himself sufficiently secure in the novel. He long resisted the call of the theater. Although he stormed and objected every time Busnach sug? gested an adaptation, he invariably gave in. For we must not underestimate the immense and glittering prestige of the stage in France nor the power of the tacit understanding that until a literary movement had conquered the stage it had not really acquired droit de cite. Like Balzac, like Daudet, like Flaubert and the Goncourt brothers, he succumbed to the temptation. And behind them all towered the grandiose figure of Victor Hugo, for what was Zola seeking, with the help of William Busnach, if not his own bataille d'Hernani? University or California Davis 30 Le Naturalisme au thidtre, "Les Decors et les acces- soires," pp. 75-76. 31 One must distinguish between Zola's insistence upon elaborate decors as a factor in "realism" and the glittering elaboration of decor a la Scribe which he rightly condemned. The consistency of his argument (provided one accepts his presumptions about "reality") often escaped his contempo? raries, who reproached him with doing what he condemned in others. 32 Quoted by Carter, op. cit., p. 164. 33 A.
