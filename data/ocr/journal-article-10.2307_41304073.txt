<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judean Drummers By Raz Kletter and Katri Saarelainen Abstract This article discusses a unique type of clay figurines from late Iron Age II Judah (8th - 7th centuries B.C.E.). They are similar to the famous Judean pillar figurines, but instead of arms supporting breasts they hold round 'discs' on their chests. An updated list is offered, including several unpublished examples. Contrary to recently expressed views, we suggest that these figurines portray a drum-playing female figure, based on comparisons with female and male drum playing figurines from other regions. This conclusion is important for understanding the nature and meaning of drum playing figurines in the Iron Age Levant. 1. Judean 'Disc' Holding Figurines A complete figurine from a private collection was published in 1927 under the rubric ''very primitive"1. This unique 'pillar' figurine shows a standing figure holding by both hands a large 'disc' against the chest. Since the provenance is unknown, scholars hardly notice this figurine. Similar handmade figurines - unfortunately fragmented - have been found in the following decades, though their number remains small. Often, only a drawing or a photograph was published without textual discussion; for example, for figurines from Hirbet Salih/Ramat Rahel 2 and Jerusalem3. PRITCHARD4 was the first scholar to comment about the 'disc' of these Judean figurines, referring to one fragment from Gibeon. He suggested that it may be a bread loaf, a disc or a tambourine. The indecisiveness is not surprising: at the time 'disc' holding figurines from northern Israel and Phoenicia were already quite well known; but scholars could not agree if their 'discs' represent tambourines, cakes, drums, rattles or perhaps platters 5. Similar ideas were expressed, therefore, about the few fragments of 'disc' holding figurines from Judah. In his unpublished Ph.D. thesis, HOLLAND6 writes that these figurines form a coherent group, which exists only in Judah. Five items were known at that time. HOLLAND saw that they were different from 'disc' holding figurines from northern Israel and Phoenicia and suggested that the 'disc' is a shield, mainly because it is different than the 'discs' held by northern figurines: it is larger and (except in one case) undecorated. In the 1990s, one of us studied anthropomorphic figurines of Iron Age Judah7. A cat- alogue of nearly a thousand Judean pillar figurines was prepared. Judean pillar figurines are 1 Reifenberg 1927, 95, no. 127; cf.

Other types of figurines were briefly examined, including 'disc' holding figurines from Judah. They are local, very similar to the Judean pillar figurines and interpreted as a variant of the latter - and as drum players8. Variations are common in the world of ancient figurines; for example, plaque figurines are usually defined as frontally molded and lacking a stable base. Yet a few are molded from both sides 9 and some are free standing 10. Scholars recently studied drum-playing figurines from the Levant and referred briefly to this Judean group. Paz11 suggested that drum-playing figurines do not appear in Judah. She acknowledges, in a brief note, that there are Judean pillar figurines holding a disc 12; but in her opinion they are not drummers: "The round objects, with one exception, are not decorated. Their size varies, but most are too large to represent drums. Holland (1975: 181-182) proposes identifying the object as a shield, and even adduces parallels in shield-bearing figurines from Cyprus. As to the posture of the figures holding the object, in most instances the hands are poorly preserved, but some clearly hold it from both sides, unlike the drumming posture depicted in the plaque figurines" ,3. Based on the assumed absence of female drummer figurines in Judah - which is only 'neg- ative evidence' - Paz makes some far-reaching conclusions. Allegedly, musical traditions in the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah are different. Women in the Kingdom of Israel played hand-held drums in victory songs for men returning from battles, and probably also on other occasions. However, Judah was another world - women in Judah did not play drums 14; they must have enjoyed some other kind of music. SUGIMOTO 15 accepts that the figurines from Judah depict drummers; the larger 'discs' may be a stylistic variation, still representing drummers. Yet, he does not explicitly object to Paz's conclusions: "If we exclude these unusual examples, there is no specimen of disc- holding female pillar figurines from Judah" 16. He does not suggest excluding any other 'disc' holding figurine, though, even when they show unusual features. SUGIMOTO17 observes, however, that Judean 'disc' holding figurines are very close to the Judean pillar figurines. Several more Judean 'disc' holding figurines have been found since the 1990s. Thus, they are not extremely exceptional. The number of figurines and their distribution imply that the group as a whole is not a whimsical creation of a single potter from a single site. Their nature is clearly Judean and they are not imported. Following is an updated list of Judean 'disc' holding figurines: 8 Kletter 1996, 232, Appendix 3, nos. 11, 246, type 5.1.3. 9 Kletter/Covello-Paran/Saarelainen 2010. 10 Saarelainen /Kletter forthc for variations in drummer figurines cf.

A hand-made head and upper body from AHARONl's excavations at Hirbet Salih/Ramat Rahel (Fig. 1). The figure holds a large 'disc' close to the body. The left hand is placed near the bottom of the 'disc'; the right hand (now broken) was probably situated higher on the 'disc'. This resembles the position of one hand holding and the other beating a drum. The figurine is currently exhibited at the Ramat Rahel hotel 19. 3. A hand-made head and upper body part from Ken YON' s excavations in Jerusalem. The hands hold an object, probably a 'disc'. According to the drawings of this fragment, one hand is on the 'disc' and the other is broken off 20 . Holland reports the location as the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. In the Schweich lectures' publication, Moorey21 refers to drum holding figurines from the Ashmolean, but not to this specific one 22. Fig. 1.

The Qishleh building was established as barracks for soldiers in the late 19th century C.E. and was later used as a jail. It is located near the 'David Tower' and was excavated by A. Re'em on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (Fig. 3; Reg. No. 2049-24). The neck is broken. Both hands are crudely shaped, holding a large rounded 'disc' of clay in front of the chest. The arms are placed outside the 'disc', but the hands are worn out. The upper part of the disc is missing and its center is slightly damaged 26. 8. A figurine from the REIFENBERG collection, Jerusalem (Taf. 2). It is the only complete 'disc' holding figurine from Judah. The publication is laconic 27 . According to the pub- lished picture, the figurine has a simple handmade head and a pillar body. A large round 'disc' covers the entire chest, reaching the neck. The figure holds the 'disc' by schematic hands, both placed at the same height - on the outside of the 'disc'. The figurine reached the collection at a very early date, prior to 1927; hence, it is unlikely to be a forgery. Fig. 3. Judean drummer, Jerusalem (height 56mm); drawing M.

An unprovenanced item from the collections of the Bibel + Orient Museum, Fribourg, Switzerland (Taf. 3A-C). It was purchased as part of a group of items from a Jerusalem antiquities shop by Jeremias 28. Attention was rightly given to another unique item from this group, which has been discussed several times 29 . However, the group included also this body fragment showing two hands holding a large 'disc'. JEREMIAS30 called it a tambourine, but gave only a laconic description. The head is missing. The 'disc' is large; a small part of it is broken off at the top. It is held on the chest close to the body. Both hands are placed on the outer side of the 'disc'. The surface is covered by white wash and dark red paint, and the 'disk' was probably decorated in a geometric pattern of bands leading to the center, which has faded by now. There is no doubt that this fragment is authentic, since a forger would not have bothered to produce a broken, headless fragment at a time when the existence of Judean 'disc' holding figurines was little known. The following three figurine fragments possibly, but not certainly, relate to this type: 10. A body from Kenyon's excavations in Jerusalem (Reg. No. C770). One arm remained, holding an object ('disc'?). The figurine was found in Cave I, and is currently at Otago. The head was probably molded, since it seems that there are traces of a peg31. 11. A body from Kenyon's excavations in Jerusalem, currently at Leeds University. The hands probably held a 'disc' 32. 12. A body from the City of David excavations, Jerusalem (Reg. No. El/ 13037). It has the usual breasts and arms and was classified as a Judean pillar figurine, but a small 'disc' is applied above the chest, close to the body 33 . 2. Drum Playing Figurines Everywhere Clay figurines of standing females depicted holding a disc-like object against their chests appear in significant numbers in the Iron Age II period in the Levant. Different views about the 'discs' held by these figurines appeared in the early days of research. Scholars suggested that they represented cakes, loafs of bread, the sun, shields, drums, tambourines, and even platters or bowls of offerings. In recent years, scholars agree that most of these figurines hold hand-drums. A few of these figurines with smaller 'discs' held evenly between the hands, lower on the body, may represent cymbal players 34. More realistic drum-holding figurines made in the round from Phoenicia prove that the figure is actually playing a drum. The Phoenician figurines show the 'disc' perpendicular to the body, held by one hand at the bottom while the palm of the other hand rests flattened against the outer surface of the 'disc'. This hand beats the 'disc' and hence the figure depicts a musician - a drum player. The same interpretation holds true for less realistic 'disc' holding figurines. For example, plaque figurines from the area of the Kingdom of Israel show the 28 Jeremias 1993, 41. 29Uehlinger 1997, 149-152, fig. 61; Keel 2007, 48, no. 33; Gilmour 2009, 101, no. 8. 3U Jeremias 1993, fig. 5b. 31 Holland 1975, 100, fig.l2:3, A.XI.37; 139, fig. 7:3; Kletter 1996, 202, no. 312. 32 Holland 1975, fig. 11:9, A.XI.27; Kletter 1996, 209, no. 424. 33 Kletter 1996, 223, no. 664.

The reason is technical: the relatively shallow, frontal molding of plaque figurines did not allow a perpendicular positioning of the drum35. The numbers of female drummer figurines are by no means vast. The latest catalogues include a little more than a hundred figurines from all over Palestine, southern Phoenicia and Transjordan 36, as compared to ca. 850 Judean pillar figurines from Judah alone 37 . It is important to note that drum-playing female figurines appear over a wide area encom- passing many cultural areas /kingdoms. We find them as figurines in the round in Phoenicia, usually with hollow, wheel-made bodies and single-molded heads; but two double-molded examples are also known38. They are quite common in Cyprus in the late Geometric and Archaic periods, appearing in several techniques: handmade, wheel-made and molded. Some Cypriote figurines hold the drum perpendicular to the body; others flat against the chest39. Drum playing figurines are known from the Kingdom of Israel, mainly as plaque figurines (Fig. 4)40, but seldom with hollow, wheel-made bodies41. In Transjordan they appear as Fig. 4.

In Transjordan and in the Kingdom of Israel, some drum-players in the round show the tambourine flat against the chest44 and are more schematic than the plaque figurines from the same areas. 'Edomite' plaque figurines of drummers are found at some sites in the Negev, such as Hirbet el-Garra/Tel Tra45 and Tell el-MilhlTel Malhata (Fig. 5)46. Both Paz47 and SUGI- MOTO48 add to their catalogues six drum fragments from the site of Horvat Qitmit - an 'Edomite' site south of Judah - as indication for six more figurines. They define them as figurines in the round. Indeed, Beck, who published these items, wrote that they are not "tambourines held on the chest, of the type found in nearby Tel cIra" 49 . She means that they are not parts of plaque figurines. However, we doubt that these are fragments of independent Fig. 5.

Given the nature of the Horvat Qitmit assemblage, these are more likely fragments of figures detached from cult stands / vessels 5(). There are very few freestanding figurines at Horvat Qitmit , but numerous fragments of (and several complete) cult stands. Drum playing figurines are also found in Philistia, though rarely. SUGIMOTO51 ascribes two figurines to Philistia, but they come from Gezer, hence belonging perhaps to the King- dom of Israel. Another figurine was found at Tell Gemme in the western Negev 52. It is probably a hollow pillar figurine with a molded head; the date is not clear. Works on figurines from Philistine cities, such as Ashkelon, do not exhibit more figurines of this type 53. Gitin (personal communication) kindly informed us that one drum-playing figurine was found at Hirbet el-Muqannac /Tel Miqne/ Ekron. Another body fragment from Tell el-Qaslle level VIII has hands holding a 'disc'. However, it is very small and located under the breasts, perhaps representing cymbals 54. Female drum playing figurines are found in all the regions surrounding Judah in the Iron Age II period; in our view, they also appear in Judah. 3. Male or Female? A Drum or a Shield? A question arises about the gender of the Judean 'disc' holding figurines. Like all the Judean pillar figurines, their lower bodies are schematic, showing no clear indication of gender. They do not show breasts, but this does not make them male, because the potters covered the entire chest area with the 'disc'. Potters had no special reason to add breasts (as they did in the case of Judean pillar figurines) only in order to hide them from view by the 'disc'. Also, addition of breasts would have made it harder to secure the 'disc' onto the chest. The potters and their customers did not have doubts about the gender of the figurines and hence, they did not consider that absence of breasts might cause problems of identification for future scholars. Many Phoenician drummer figurines lack breasts too, although they are more realistic in style; yet, all agree that they are female drummers. In our view, the Judean 'disc' holding figurines are female, because they stem directly from the female pillar figurines of Judah. They are very similar to the latter - only with 'discs' replacing the breasts. This does not rob them of female identity. Were they male figurines, potters would have explicitly marked the change from female to male; for example, by adding a male organ. In Iron Age Judah, as in surrounding kingdoms, male figurines are rare and are mostly found as horse-riders. Finally - though hardly a decisive argument by itself - no scholar suggested explicitly that these Judean 'disc' holding figurines are male. With Judean pillar figurines, the heads are either handmade (forming one part with the body) or molded (and attached to the body by a peg). It seems that all the 'disc' holding figurines from Judah had handmade, pinched heads (no. 10 might be an exception, but the 50 Beck 1995, 168. 51 SUGIMOTO 2008, 21, Catalogue PL1-2. 52 Sugimoto 2008, 28, Catalogue PPL1. 53 Press 2007. 54 B.

ZDPV 127 (2011) 1</page><page sequence="10">20 Raz Kletter and Katri Saarelainen exact type of head is unclear). Perhaps handmade heads were cheaper 'versions' than molded heads. However, this is nothing but a guess. The main arguments against the identification of these Judean figurines as drummers concern the 'discs' they are holding: they are larger than 'discs' held by drum playing figurines from other cultural regions; not decorated (except one); and differently held. How- ever, following the same criteria, many figurines from the Kingdom of Israel and other regions classified by Paz and by SUGIMOTO as drummers would lose the right to be inter- preted as such. Many plaque figurines from Israel lack decoration on the 'disc' and the size of the 'disc' varies too. The position of the 'disc' varies too - some plaque figurines have exceptional postures and yet they are classified as drummers by Paz 55. To quote Kolotou- ROU: "The thickness and the size of the clay disc, however, are subject to the skillfulness of the coroplast. As a result, they vary from workshop to workshop" 56. Speaking about figurines outside Judah, Paz 57 cites Tadmor about the "technical exigen- cies involved in the production of mould figurines" 58. Different postures relate to different techniques and not to different meanings 59. Ornan 60 makes a similar observation regarding small clay figurines: not all their features are realistic. Realism was not the strong side of Judean coroplasts, as has been stressed by one of us61. To the best of our knowledge, no scholar disputes this fact. Figurines of Iron Age Judah are more schematic than those of neighboring kingdoms and this applies to the Judean 'disc' holding figurines as well. Dec- oration is inconclusive as an argument for interpreting the 'disc', since both shields and drums appear on ancient figurines with or without decoration. Furthermore, painted decoration is often badly preserved on Judean figurines, as against incised, molded or applied decoration in figurines from other areas. Judean 'disc' holding figurines do not show a realistic position of drumming, but the same is also true for many plaque figurines of drummers. This relates to different artistic and technical abilities in different cultures. One figurine from Tell Gemme in Philistia, close to Judah, also exhibits a larger than usual, undecorated 'disc' 62. It also holds the 'disc' close to the chest with its rim reaching the neck. The arms are also placed besides the 'disc' - unlike the arms of drummers from Israel and Phoenicia. All these features of the Tell Gemme figurine find exact parallels with 'disc' holding Judean figurines63. Surprisingly, PAZ accepts the figurine from Tell Gemme as a genuine "woman drummer" It seems that the need to deny the interpretation of figurines as drum players subsides the moment one steps outside the borders of Judah. To refute the interpretation of the Judean figurines as drummers, Paz returns to the suggestion by Holland65, that the 'disc' of figurine no. 5 (above) is a shield. Holland thought so, because the 'disc' is larger than those held by 'northern' plaque drummers and has 55 Paz 2007, 36-37, fig. 2.1-2.2. 56Kolotourou 2005, 199. 57 Paz 2007, 73. 58 Tadmor 2006. 59 Cf.

Karageorghis 67 clarifies that the Cypriote figurine is male, as proven by a black painted beard. It holds a shield by the left hand obliquely to the body, with the hand placed inside, between the shield and the body. The right arm was raised, and based on similar Cypriote figurines it probably held a weapon, such as a spear. Bodies of this type of Cypriote figurines were hollow and had mobile legs fixed by holes. The only close resemblance between this figurine and the Judean parallel is the similar decoration on the 'disc' - the Cypriote figurine exhibits petals with red spots and a red central boss. Petals or rosettes are a common motif, however. We do have figurines bearing shields from Iron Age Judah, but they are very different from the above listed Judean 'disc' holders. The figurines appear as male figures in the Lachish reliefs and as male horse-riders. A good example is a horse and rider figurine wielding a shield from Tell ed-Duwer/ Lachish68. The shield, as one can only expect, is always carried by one hand. The hand is always placed between the shield and the body - being protected by the shield. In more realistic figurines of horse-riders from Cyprus, shields are sometimes shown, for example, hanging on the back or on the arm69. Warriors do hold shields by both hands, since they must also wield weapons. In portrayals of chariot teams, drivers hold shields, not weapons. Yet, they too can spare just one hand for the shield, because the other holds the reigns70. The Judean 'disc' holding figurines discussed here are different. Fig. 6.

This makes it extremely unlikely that these Judean figurines are shield bearers. Figurines from Judah exhibit some similarities with Cypriote figurines. This is seen, for example, in upward tilted faces of some 'pinched' heads; in certain horse heads that are portrayed more realistically than the common schematic Judean horse figurines; and in motifs of painted decoration on horses and riders. This phenomenon was first noticed by ClASCA71 and will be discussed elsewhere 72 . However, Cypriote shield bearers are nor the only, neither the best comparison for the Judean 'disc' holding figurines. Another type of Cypriote 'disc' holding figurine is a much better comparison (Fig. 7)73. V. Karageorghis interprets all the figurines of this type as musicians (tambourine players). This is clear because they hold the 'disc' with two hands, located on the outer side - just as in the Judean examples. It is difficult to determine the gender of some of these figurines; they seem to include both males and females74.

Hence, the latter should also be interpreted as drum players. 4. Use of Biblical Sources Denying the existence of female drummer figurines from Judah does not stem from archaeo- logical observations, but from a pre-conceived view about the nature of Judah. Paz uncriti- cally embraces the concept that Judah and Israel were completely different entities, hence they could never have formed a United Monarchy 76 . The Kingdom of Israel was allegedly a "true", "full-blown" state in the Iron Age II, whereas Judah was a marginal "chiefdom", never becoming a "full-blown" state - or only much later than Israel. Paz interprets the difference in figurines as support to this view. Theories about 'states' and 'chiefdoms' are notoriously difficult. Their particular use by I. Finkelstein concerning ancient Israel and Judah is based on an outdated neo-evolutionary model, abused by the replacement of the original terms with vague, ill-defined terms such as "full-blown states". Instead of substan- tiating the model by data, the model is seen as proof in a case where data is mostly lacking77. Many scholars do not share Finkelstein' s views78. There are differences of material culture between Judah and Israel; this is not a new observation 79 . The surprising fact is the naive view that takes such differences as conclusive proof for the lack of a United Monarchy, or for widely different societies in Judah and Israel. Kingdoms with 'mixed' populations and material cultures existed, from northern Israel itself to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Differences in material culture are not decisive evidence for different societal structure or ethnicities. Paz's discussion of the biblical sources80 leaves much to be desired: it is 'minimalist' only in scope. When dealing with northern Israel and plaque figurines, she uses the Bible freely and as a reliable source. Biblical verses are taken as evidence for female musicians and their victory songs. Only for Judah and Judean figurines, biblical sources are ignored. For example, the moving of the ark to Jerusalem by David (2 Sam 6:5) brings Paz to the conclusion that a musical tradition relating to the drum "was known in Israel before the 7th century BCE"81. Which "Israel" does she read here? On the one hand, 'minimalists' do not acknowledge a United Monarchy that includes Israel and Judah as a historical reality. For 'minimalists', 2 Sam 6:5 cannot be used to reconstruct Iron Age traditions at all. On the other hand, if this verse is reliable, it speaks about David in Jerusalem. It proves that drum playing was known in Judah (and perhaps also in northern Israel). PAZ ignores this obvious conclu- sion by a peculiar method: reading 'Israel' here not as the United Monarchy (which includes Judah), but only as the Northern Kingdom. Armed with such a method of "maximalist min- imalism", it is possible to find everything, even a hornless unicorn. 76 Paz 2007, 103. 77 Kletter 2004a. 78 A.

ZDPV 127 (2011) 1</page><page sequence="14">24 Raz Kletter and Katri Saarelainen Paz also ignores Judah because, allegedly, "most of the passages describe the reality and traditions of the Kingdom of Israel" 82. This is another misunderstanding. The Old Testament is a Judean creation, it reflects mainly Judah. Some biblical 'sources' originate from the north (Israel), but they have been received, edited and redacted in Judah by Judeans. Perhaps Israelite refugees moved to Judah after 734-720 B.C.E. - though it is a disputed theory. However, they could not remain 'northern Israelite' until the post-exilic reductions of the Old Testament. A 'northern' view about women playing drums would not have survived in Judah, if the Judeans did not know what drum playing is. The only conclusion, if one accepts such verses as reliable (as Paz does), is that the musical traditions of Israel and Judah were similar. This stands in complete opposition to Paz's conclusions. Paz writes that "although some of the passages were certainly composed and edited after the Iron Age, others were already written down by the 7th century BCE, and thus reflect the reality of the period from which most of the artefacts under discussion here derive " 83 . Re- gardless of the vexed problem of dating biblical verses, one must point out that her dating fits the Judean figurines (mostly late 8th - 7th centuries B.C.E.) much better than the drummer figurines of the Kingdom of Israel (mostly 10th - 9th centuries B.C.E.) 84. 5. Conclusions 'Disc' holding figurines from Judah are a local version of female drum players. They are more schematic, but they represent the same theme as female drum playing figurines from Phoenicia, Israel, Cyprus and Transjordan. The Old Testament sources do not indicate differ- ent musical traditions in Judah and in Israel. The sources are really far too limited to support such interpretation. Hand drums were known in Judah, and there is no reason to suppose that their use was different than in northern Israel. Hand drums were most likely played by both women and men, as Cypriote figurines show 85 . While men are mentioned in the Old Testa- ment as participants in a cult orchestra (1 Sam 10:5-6), the references are very few. There is no certainty that women were completely excluded from music in religious contexts in Iron Age Israel and Judah; at least in Egypt women occupied senior positions in religious music 86. The finding of female rather than male drum playing figurines may relate to the scarcity of small male figurines in Iron Age Palestine (except horse riders), not necessarily to gender differences in drum playing. Recent works on drummer figurines stress different directions. Braun 87 focuses on mu- sical instruments and traditions and does not discuss the meaning and function /s of the figurines. Paz focuses on gender. She reads the figurines and the few relevant biblical verses as reflecting "female resistance"; "means for the women to express their covert and conscious opposition to the ruling ideology", and "feminine ideological resistance"88. However, one should be careful from applying modern convictions to ancient periods. We support equality in the modern world; but ancient Israelite women could not have followed such a modern 82 Paz 2007, 85. 83 Paz 2007, 84; our stress. 84 Paz 2007, 55; Sugimoto 2008, 34. 85 Kolotourou 2005, 191-192; cf.

He suggests that small figurines indi- cate a significant religious change from polytheism in the early Iron Age II to monotheism in the late Iron Age II. In his view, northern drummer figurines are related to Astarte; the number of figurines dwindles after the 9th century, since the Israelites developed "hesitation towards Canaanite -related cultic artifacts". The later numerable Judean pillar figurines are not representations of Asherah 90. However, SUGIMOTO does relate the few Judean drummers with Astarte /Ishtar 91 . It is a very interesting study 92 . Yet, the reconstruction of the development of monotheism, based on figurines, is hardly convincing. Different dates of figurine assemblages relate to dates of destruction of archaeological layers. Periods with few discovered figurines offer only negative evidence. Thus, low numbers of figurines may denote lack of destructions, rather than scarcity of figurines. There is no reason to relate drummer figurines in northern Israel with Canaanite cult. Their use in the Iron Age II indicates continuation of artistic motifs, not necessarily of Canaanite cult. The reconstruction is also arbitrary in that the 'divine status' of Judean pillar figurines is denied, while it is accepted for other (very similar) figurines, only in order to fit the theory of development of 'monotheism'. The term 'monotheism' is very complex93; can it be successfully reconstructed on the basis of small clay figurines? The meaning of drum-playing figurines remains an enigma. For drummer figurines from Israel, Transjordan and Phoenicia, there are two major 'schools' of thought. Some scholars believe that these figurines represent goddess/es 94 . Other scholars suggest that they represent mortal women, yet still in relation to goddess/es 95 . For Judah, many scholars hold that the Judean pillar figurines represent Asherah but others view them as votive figurines repre- senting worshipers97. It is important to stress that the interpretation of clay figurines as goddesses does not negate the possibility that they functioned as votive objects; these two interpretations are not opposed 98. How to interpret Judean female drummers in relation to Judean pillar figurines and to 'northern' plaques of drummers? Perhaps the great similarity between the Judean drummer figurines and the Judean pillar figurines calls for a similar interpretation. Namely, they could both represent Asherah, the consort of Yahweh. Drum playing figurines from other areas can be interpreted in relation to other goddesses, which occupied prominent roles in these areas, such as Astarte. According to this view, artistic motifs, such as the drum, could be shared between various areas and different goddesses. Of course, there are other possibilities, such as interpreting all drum playing figurines, including the Judean ones, as representation of the same goddess 99 . Another question relates to the origin of Judean drummers: were they 'in- vented' independently or influenced by drum playing figurines from outside Judah?
