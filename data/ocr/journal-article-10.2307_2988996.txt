<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLATONIC JUSTICE' HANS KELSEN I HE mark of Platonic philosophy is a radical dualism. The Platonic world is not one of unity; and the abyss which in many ways results from this bifurcation ap- pears in innumerable forms. LJt is not one, but two worlds, which Plato sees when with the eyes of his soul he envisages a transcendent, spaceless, and timeless realm of the Idea, the thing-in-itself, the true, absolute reality of tranquil being, and when to this transcendent realm he opposes the perceptible, space-time sphere of his sensuous perception-a sphere which appears to us only as a domain of illusory semblance, of becom- ing in motion, a realm which in reality is not-being. If one of these worlds is taken as the subject-indeed, the only possible subject of valid rational cognition, of pure thought and true knowledge, of episteme-then the other world is the extremely doubtful object of sensuous perception, of mere opinion, doxa. This is the same antithesis which appears in the Platonic doctrine of finite and infinite. In the sphere of determination, or of the forms, the principle of freedom prevails, subject to final or normative law. In the sphere of uncertainty or materi- ality, compulsion rules according to the law of cause and effect. A modern philosopher might speak of this as the contrast be- tween spirit and nature, between value and actuality. It is the antithesis of art and experience, of thought and feeling, of active creativity and passive receptivity, of poetry and imitation, of unity and plurality, of totality and sum-total. Expressed in its most general terms, it is the antithesis of the Same and the Other. As concerns human affairs, however, it is the antithesis of the immortal soul which strives for reason and divinity as ITranslated from the German by Glenn Negley. 367</page><page sequence="2">368 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS against the mortal body imprisoned in the senses, a conflict which was of the greatest significance in the Platonic doctrine. Finally, it is the comprehensive opposition which exists in Platonic metaphysics between the celestial, divine beyond and the earthly, human world of the present. This multiform, protean dualism, which makes use of the space-time symbolism of over and under, right and left, before and behind, sooner and later, is, in the final analysis and in its most primitive sense, the opposition of good and evil. This ethical connotation is not the only one possible; but it is the primary aspect of the Platonic dualism; it is the deepest layer of Platonic thought in which all others take root as in a nourish- ing soil. The ethical dualism of good and evil is, as it were, an inner ring which is enveloped by the dualism of epistemology and ontology which grew out of and beyond the ethical dualism itself. It is evident that the key to all the oppositions in which Platonic thought moves, the real meaning of Platonic dualism, is to be found in the basic treatment of good and evil; but this is true not merely because of the fact that, whenever this oppo- sition between the two worlds occurs in Plato's thought, it appears as an opposition of values, as a separation between a higher and a lower world, between a realm of value and a realm without value. The situation is evident first of all in the fact that the ethical maintains a position of unmistakably primary importance in the Platonic philosophy. It is only in the sphere of ethics, wherein the good is freed from all the material of sensuous experience, that the notion of pure thought is possible. Throughout all the manifold speculations concerned with such a variety of objects as is met with in the Platonic dialogues, through the many deviations from the main subject under con- sideration, the moral idea remains every steady, fixed as a polestar. It alone points the way through the frequent involved trains of thought to the final goal; and this goal of the entire Platonic philosophy, the goal toward which Plato strives from</page><page sequence="3">PLATONIC JUSTICE 369 the most diverse points of view and with the greatest energy from the first to the last of his works-that goal is the absolute good. The good, however, is inconceivable, apart from evil. If good is to be the object of cognition, then cognition must also recognize evil; and this is true in the Platonic philosophy, which is by no means a doctrine of the good as it is usually represented, but a speculation concerning good-evil. It is true that the idea of the good in the Platonic representa- tion stands out more clearly than the conception of evil; the reflections concerned with good are developed with more force and clarity than are those which have evil as their object. It is natural that the will as well as the thought of the moralist should be directed upon the good. Evil would not be thought of at all were it not for the necessity of conceiving it as the antithesis of the good; but it remains as subordinate-merely tolerated in the glorious apotheosis of the good. As it is only a shadow in the light of the good, it must remain a shadow in all representations of the good. Only in the last of the Platonic writings does evil assume a more solid form and become estab- lished like the good in the form of a particular substance. Only in a late period of his creativity did evil become for Plato a reality, a being, and then only after he had been forced to recognize that the representation of evil as becoming in onto- logical dualism was, in fact, an indication of being. This is the reason why the original conception of Platonic dualism holds that only the world of the Idea partakes of real existence; the world of the Idea is the world of the good simply because the good is the central idea-in fact, the Idea. On the other hand, the world of things, of becoming, must be regarded as not-being, because this world of becoming, the empirical world of sensuous, perceptible reality, the temporal world of factual events-this is the world of evil, in so far as it is in opposition to the world of the good. It can be none other than a world of evil, although Plato did not explicitly designate it as such. By definition, only the good shall be; evil shall not be; and for this reason, evil is</page><page sequence="4">370 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS not-being, and only the good is being. For ethical thought, shall implies being; because the moralist intends that evil shall not be, it becomes for him not-being. In this manner he satisfies will by cognition; and this primacy of the will over cognition, which is decisive for moral character, appears as the primacy of obligation (shall) over existence (being), of value over ac- tuality. In the pure system of the good there is no place for evil. This is expressed in the Platonic speculation concerning good-evil, as well as in other such speculations, by denying the quality of being to evil or its ontological representation. What shall be, is; it has "real" existence even though-or because-that which appears to us as being, shall not be. For this reason, it is neces- sary that a distinction be made between true or real being and apparent being; that which has being from an ordinary point of view must be reduced to the status of a mere semblance of being. Thought which is directed toward true being must be placed above the sensuous perception of this semblance of being; ethics must take precedence over natural science in order that the good, that which shall be, can be asserted as really being. On the other hand, that which appears as being for ordinary perception shall not be, because it is not the good; it is evil, and as evil it is not-being. Similarly, every attempt to explain the world in ethical terms, every speculation concerning good and evil, has done violence to the naturalistic conception. The world-view which is based upon the reality of sensuous experi- ence, i.e., knowledge afforded by nature, is directly inverted by the view which has its origin in the ethical justification of value and spirit. Because evil is the complete negation of good, ethical dual- ism in its original sense is absolute. The tendency to give ab- solute form to conceivable oppositions is a rather sure sign of normative ethics, of contemplation directed finally to value rather than upon reality, to the transcendental shall rather than upon empirical being. In contrast to normative ethics, empiri-</page><page sequence="5">PLATONIC JUSTICE 37I cal investigation will if possible avoid working with opposites. Rather will it endeavor to relate whatever oppositions are pre- sented, i.e., to assume degrees of difference, gradual passages from one to another, arranging the abundance of phenomena in a series according to quantitative differences so that each passes over into the other. It is, therefore, concerned above all with the notion of evolution. Even the history of Greek thought shows us how the cognition of nature undertook to free itself of religious and ethical speculation by making relative the oppo- sites upon which such speculative views of the world are based. In general, all such opposites of religious and ethical specula- tion are derived from the fundamental opposition between good and evil. Thus, the process of making relative this fundamental opposition of good and evil is one of the bridges by means of which ethics passes over into natural science. The decisive point in this process is this: Not only the good, but evil also, is con- ceived as being, as reality; conversely, empirical reality is per- ceived not only as evil, but also as good, as a mixture of good and evil. This process of making relative the opposition be- tween good and evil is the first step toward the self-dissolution of speculation concerning good and evil; that speculation is driven backward in favor of the cognition of empirical reality. In the original Platonic conception of world-structure, there is clearly present an inclination to make absolute this funda- mental dualism of good and evil. Between the two worlds into which the whole universe is split, between the realms of opinion and knowledge, Plato assumes an unmitigated opposition. If the path which leads from the world of mere appearance to the perception of true being is to be followed, it is necessary that there be a complete liberation from the world of sensuous ex- perience, a radical "about-face"; but this complete turning- away from the world of sensuality to the spiritual world would be incomprehensible if it did not at the same time signify a turning-away from evil and a turning-toward the good. What Plato means by the famous image of the cave is:- That the</page><page sequence="6">372 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS true analogy for this indwelling power in the soul and the in- strument whereby each of us apprehends is that of an eye that could not be converted to the light from the darkness except by turning the whole body. Even so this organ of knowledge must be turned around from the world of becoming together with the entire soul, until the soul is able to endure the contemplation of essence and the brightest region of being. And this, we say, is the good, do we not? In this connection, however, we are told that the soul, although possessing good power of percep- tion, cannot completely achieve this "turning-around"; it is "forcibly enlisted in the service of evil, so that the sharper its sight the more mischief it accomplishes"; it is burdened by "the leaden weights, so to speak, of our birth and becoming, which .... turn downwards the vision of the soul."12 Only if the sphere of sensuous perception signifies the evil, and that of thought indicates the good, can one understand the refusal to unite perception and thought. In this doctrine of complete re- versal there is expressed neither a psychological nor an episte- mological insight. Only the ethical experience of a sinner who has become a saint can approach awareness of the typical ad- venture of such an overwhelming conversion. It is the specula- tion on good and evil which co-ordinates the opposites of sensu- ous perception and thought with those of the particular and the idea, respectively; and thus the opposition is maintained right into the absolute itself. On the other hand, there is evidence in Plato's doctrine of a tendency to make these opposites relative. His thought is as divided as the world which it reflects. Thus one sees in his work a rugged dualism which tolerates no bridges over which cogni- tion might proceed from one world to the other, and a profound pessimism which denies this world and the possibility of know- ing it in order to affirm that other world in being and knowing. Plato expresses a pessimistic dualism which is as extreme as any ever dared by a genius who scorned nature and natural 2 Republic 5i8-i9 (Shorey).</page><page sequence="7">PLATONIC JUSTICE 373 science. It is extreme in that he denies the possibility of em- pirical science and proclaims the only object of true perception to be that which lies beyond experience. At the same time, he is obviously striving to fill up in some manner the chasm be- tween the two worlds by shoving in a middle term-a mediator for the implacable opposition of these products of dualistic speculation. This doctrine of mediation appears in many forms; but always it is the symptom of a turning-away from pessimistic dualism to an attitude which recognizes also the reality of the empirical world. II The intellectual activity of great moralists is rooted in their personal life to a greater extent than is true of other thinkers, because all speculation of good and evil arises out of profound moral experience. So the compelling pathos which appears in the work of Plato, his tragic dualism and the heroic effort to overcome it, are deeply grounded in the particular character of Plato as an individual, as well as in circumstance and in the conditioning of his personal attitude toward life by these factors. The course of Plato's life is essentially determined by the passion of love, the Platonic Eros. The image of Plato's life which can be made out from the documents left by him does not picture the cold, contemplative nature of a scholar who is con- tent to look upon the world merely as an object of knowledge. Here is no philosopher whose meditation and endeavor are directed solely to the observation and penetration of the ma- chinery of human and external phenomena merely to the end of attaining an explanation of the perplexities of experience. Rather, there appears here a soul shaken by the most violent passions, a soul in which there lives, in intimate and inextricable union with his Eros, an indomitable will to power, the power over men. To love men and at the same time to shape them, to love them in the very shaping itself, and to make their com- munity into a community of love-this is the aspiration of Plato's life. His aim was to form men and to reform their</page><page sequence="8">374 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS community. Thus, there is nothing with which his thought is more concerned than with education and the state; and, as a consequence, his greatest problem becomes that of the good or justice, which in itself constitutes the only justification for the government of men over men, the only legitimate aspect of education and the state. The pedagogical and political passion of Plato, however, has its origin in his Eros. Having once recog- nized that this Eros is the dynamic source of the Platonic phi- losophy, we cannot then ignore a consideration of the peculiar nature of that Eros, for it is the nature of the Eros which deter- mines Plato's personal relation to society in general and to the democratic society of Athens in particular. It is likewise the explanation of his flight from the very world he desires to domi- nate, in order that he may the better model it according to his own desire. LThis Eros, the love of youths, set Plato in opposition to society and to the world in general, for it does not appear in him as an extension and enrichment of the normal sex life as was the case in the aristocratic Athenian society (but only in this, and not in the lower social levels). Plato excludes the normal sex life. As a rule, those who loved beautiful youths had also a wife and child at home, as did Socrates; but no woman played any part in Plato's life. Marriage, which was surrounded with a halo of sanctity by Greek religion, and the family, which was a fundamental element of the Greek state, remained foreign to Plato, who spent his life in a circle of men. He felt himself unable to fulfil the most important patriotic duty-that of pro- viding the state with new citizens by begetting legitimate off- spring; and this must have been all the more painful to him because his entire intellectual attitude was directed against the moral decline of the time and aimed at the re-establishment of ancestral morality. In this complete singularity lies the danger of a. profound conflict with social reality, the laws of which are strange to the philosophic temperament. Outside of cultured Dorian circles, and especially in Athens, pederasty was looked</page><page sequence="9">PLATONIC JUSTICE 375 upon with contempt; perhaps because of its very prevalence in certain circles it was considered an unnatural vice. No trace of it is to be found in Homer. The great tragedians, Aeschylus and Sophocles, in spite of their personal inclinations, appear not to have dared to declare themselves publicly in favor of it. Euripides directly disapproved of it; comedy, especially the works of Aristophanes, scourged it with the sharpest scorn and irony; the Sophists attacked it decisively. Even the Athe- nian penal law shows a clear tendency of opposition to peder- asty. The severe attitude of condemnation which Athenian society took against this Eros is indicated, although indirectly, in the Platonic dialogues Symposium and Phaedrus, wherein Plato de- fended this boy-loving Eros against the official view, confessing to it himself, although only in its spiritualized form. But the Eros was characterized by the old Plato in his last work as dangerous for the state, as the source of "countless woes both to individuals and to whole States."3 This was undoubtedly written at a time when Plato had been freed from the tyranny of this Eros. As a youth and as a man he avoided open conflict only by the endeavor which he made from the very beginning with unparalleled energy and great moral strength to spiritualize this Eros. Because Plato regulates his Eros in the service of his philosophy, the vision of beloved boys is explained as the first step on the road to knowledge of the good. In doing this he strips his Eros of the sensuality which is its very nature, com- pletely sublimating it under the pressure of social views and his own moral convictions. He thereby achieves for himself the de- sired justification of the Eros. It is in the Symposium, that su- preme song of Platonic love, that the philosopher justifies his Eros (from which he may have suffered more than the dialogue indicates), thereby justifying himself, and at the same time justifying the world itself. To Socrates' question concerning the real nature of the Eros, Plato has the prophetess Diotima 3 Laws 836.</page><page sequence="10">376 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS answer: "He is a great spirit [daemon], and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and the mortal .... the medi- ator who spans the chasm which divides them, and therefore in him all is bound together."4 What had originally split the Platonic world unites it once again. Eros produced the separa- tion; Eros is responsible for the reunion. With this the Platonic dualism takes an optimistic turn. With the tendency to make the opposition of good and evil relative, the Platonic philosophy turns its attention to this world and aims at a unified world-view which will comprise nature. The nature which it comprises will not be considered merely as ethical, but will be conceived as itself being because it is no longer conceived as positively evil. This new direction of his thought leads him back to society and the state. In this connection it is of the greatest importance to note that Plato, in the speech of Diotima-as in the speeches of all the guests at the banquet-emphasizes the social nature of his Eros as a defense against the usual reproach that it is inimical to society and dangerous to the state. Plato affirms repeatedly that the boy- loving Eros, if it is spiritualized (and it is the only love capable of spiritualization), will propagate itself. Through the proph- etess he makes it known that the most beautiful children propa- gated by this spiritual Eros include not only poetry and the works of sculpture but also the arts of social order, of constitu- tions, laws, and works of justice. Among these "immortal chil- dren," who are more valuable than mortal offspring, Plato names the laws of Solon, and the children "Lycurgus left be- hind him to be the saviour, not only of Lacedaemon, but of Hellas."s This is a great confession for Plato, for these are the children which his Eros desired: the best laws, the just order of the state, the right education of youth. Here is revealed most clearly the inner connection which existed between the Platonic Eros and his will to power over men, between his erotic and his pedagogico-political passions. 4 Symposium 202 (Jowett). 5 Ibid. 209.</page><page sequence="11">PLATONIC JUSTICE 377 III Recent investigation of Plato has to a great extent shaken the opinion that Plato was a theoretical philosopher whose aim was the establishment of a rigorous science. Today it is known that Plato was by temperament more a politician than a theorist. One considers him today as a Herrenmenschen of an imperious temperament; one sees in him primarily the educator and found- er. Whether he really was such a person, whether he actually possessed the characteristics which accompany the will to power, whether he had the capacity of a genius of action, one may perhaps doubt. We can be certain only that his personal ideal lay in this direction: He desired what for reasons of ex- ternal circumstance was forever denied to him. His entire intel- lectual position is less a view of being than a regard for the shall which always is directed to will rather than to cognition; and since his ethical political will was thoroughly grounded in metaphysics and is consequently expressed in an outspoken religious ideology, his works give not so much the impression of a learned system of moral science as of a prophecy of the ideal state. Plato is revealed less as a psychologist or a sociologist concerned with social reality than as a preacher of justice. Testimony of this is to be found primarily in Plato's auto- biography, the so-called Epistle VII, in which the now old man, in one of his most serious moments, gives to the world an ac- count of his life. Here Plato confesses that his real desire, from youth onward, has been politics, and that he has waited all his life for the opportune moment to act. But even if we did not have this confession of Plato, it is nonetheless clear from his dialogues themselves that there existed for him this primacy of political will over theoretical knowledge. The fact that the prin- cipal problem of his philosophy to which all others are sub- ordinated is the question concerning justice betrays the fact that above all he is interested in finding a moral foundation for activity. From an abundance of detail in Plato's writings it ap- pears that the keynote in the explication of this great political</page><page sequence="12">378 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS passion is his ardent desire for mastery of the state. Even though it had not been expressed in direct and indirect intima- tions, yet he is betrayed by the principal theme of the Platonic philosophy that it is to be the task of the philosophers to rule. He is stubborn in this demand that all power in the state be vested in philosophy, but not in just any philosophy. Power is to reside in the one true philosophy which alone leads to the perception of justice and makes legitimate the claim of mastery. The Platonic doctrine is this true philosophy. Further, it is not only in Plato's work that indications are to be found of this political passion but likewise in his very life. His life stands in the shadow of a political undertaking that dated from his first journey to Sicily, when he was about forty years old, an undertaking which concerned him almost until his death, and which made unhappy the latter days of his life. This was the effort of Plato to win over to his ideas the tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius II. Plato was driven to this fatal step by his demonic Eros and by his passionate love for Dion, a young relative of the tyrant. Dion, animated perhaps by the best of intentions, perhaps only to realize the political ideals of Plato, attempted to seize control of Syracuse. This effort however only succeeded in involving the Platonic Academy, or at least its most prominent members, in a bloody civil war, in the course of which was destroyed the great Sicilian empire founded original- ly by Dionysius the First-one of the strongest state organiza- tions achieved by Hellenism, and perhaps its last stronghold in the ancient world. The name of the Platonic Academy was not exactly covered with honor in this catastrophe. The role which the Platonic Academy played in the ques- tionable undertaking of Dion-a role which Plato tacitly toler- ated-is not the only ground for suspecting that the Academy was not, as it has so long been considered, merely a school of learning, peaceful, withdrawn from the cares of the world, and devoted to pure science. The Academy which Plato had founded soon after his return from his first voyage to Sicily, and</page><page sequence="13">PLATONIC JUSTICE 379 which received encouragement especially from aristocratic cir- cles, was not, as recent investigation has shown, merely a school of learning, but a community patterned upon the Pythagorean society, a community founded upon the Platonic religion and the Platonic Eros. It is particularly in the political function of the Academy, in its character as a preparation for the vocation of statesmanship, that one recognizes its primary object. The decided anti-democratic, aristocratic tendencies of the Academy made it a stronghold of reactionary thought; but it was not only the center of conservative politics, being likewise the center of political activity as is indicated by the adventure in Syracuse. The attitude of the Academy corresponded to the fundamental intellectual position of Plato; and this Platonic philosophy was for the school at once the compensation for politics and the virtual cell of its ideal state. The literary work of the Academy was not directed so much upon exact science as upon ethical and mystical speculation. Thus the school has cor- rectly been termed a "metaphysical sect"; it indicates the final conclusion of the Platonic attitude as exemplified in the last years of Plato's life. This position is marked by a complete turning-away from Socratic rationalism through a continually increasing insight into the transcendental nature of the object of all ethical cognition, together with a conviction of the impos- sibility of representing its result rationally. Because the irra- tional does not lend itself to rational expression, Plato resorts more and more to myths when he wishes to explain that which he considers essential. No man of science would do that. Plato discovers something higher and more important than exact theory lying close to his heart, and in attempting to give it expression he speaks in dark prophetic words like a seer of the world beyond, rather than as a scientist of this world. Plato has perplexed his readers by the repeated and un- equivocal declaration that his published works are not to be taken as expressing his true thought, that in fact they are not even to be considered as his own work. If one may consider</page><page sequence="14">380 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS Epistle II as genuine, then Plato has said that he wrote nothing upon the real subject of his philosophy nor upon the ultimate or highest problem thereof. In this letter, the statement is made that: "No treatise by Plato exists or will exist, but those which now bear his name belong to a Socrates become fair and young."6 This is not the attitude of a scholar whose thought is directed to scientific knowledge; it is not the act of a man of science defending his theory simply to shake off the responsi- bility for works published over a period of years and to refuse to rise in their defense. That is rather the way of a politician for whom the theory is not an end in itself, but the means to an entirely different end: namely, to an end which seeks, not to quench man's thirst for knowledge, but rather to determine his will, to form his character, to educate and to govern him. We must then admit that there is no specific Platonic theory anywhere, i.e., there is no doctrine which is inseparably con- nected with the name of Plato, at least none of which we have knowledge. This is as Plato wished. There is a profound significance in the peculiar fact that Plato never appears as the representative of the opinions de- veloped in the works which bear his name; he first presents these views through the person of Socrates, later through an- other, the Athenian Stranger. That is the real reason why he chose the dialogue form. Doubtless this literary form appealed to his disunited nature, torn as it was with a tragic conflict; it was more appealing to him than the monologue form of a scientific treatise in which only one opinion appears, and which thus can present only one side of a given problem. Who could feel more keenly than Plato the necessity of allowing his adver- sary as well as himself an opportunity to speak? Plato had this very adversary in his own breast, and it was only by allowing him to speak that Plato could be delivered of his internal con- flict. Plato found, however, another and even greater value than 6 Epistle II 314 (Bury).</page><page sequence="15">PLATONIC JUSTICE 38i that of catharsis in the dialogue form; he discovered in this kind of presentation a possible escape from the necessity of identi- fying himself positively with any theory, however well founded it might be. The dialogues are dramatic, and in drama none of the opinions expressed by the persons acting can positively be taken as the opinion of the dramatist; and this is true even though the dramatist allows the actor to develop an opinion with all the force of persuasive rhetoric, or even to attest it by his activity. In the same manner Plato is unwilling in the last resort to take upon himself the doctrine which he expresses through Socrates. Because the non-rational nature of this doc- trine precludes its statement, he will not even agree that what Socrates has said is the substance of his thought. It has re- peatedly been said that Plato is not only a philosopher, but also, indeed even more, a poet; and that many of his works present beautiful dramas rather than the results of scientific research. Indeed, Plato is a poet in the sense that he is little concerned with what his characters say; whether their declara- tions are more or less true is a matter of little consequence to him. That to which Plato does attach the utmost importance is the effect produced by these speeches, their dialectical move- ment to a breath-taking climax, and the descending relief of dissent; but this technique is not productive of scientific con- clusions. Plato is indeed a dramatist, except that his desired effect is not aesthetic, but of a religious and moral nature. Plato's knowledge is therefore not an end in itself. Science for him, as for the Pythagoreans, is only a means to an end. Man needs knowledge in order to act rightly; and just for this reason, the only real knowledge is that of the good, of divinity. A world separates this Platonic conception from that of modern science, which rests upon the fundamental presupposi- tions that knowledge is to be sought for its own sake, that science be not directed toward any object outside itself, that its conclusions are not to be determined by the necessities of will and activity, i.e., by ruling and being ruled, namely, by politics.</page><page sequence="16">382 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS Science is therefore primarily natural science; but it is likewise true that the science of man's will and activity and of the rela- tion of men in society, even the modern science of the state, of law, and of society, rests upon an inexorable postulate of com- plete independence from politics and from religion. To know the world, either as nature or as society, is an entirely different end than that of determining the world by will, of forming or reforming it, of educating or dominating it. It is the vital law of all pure knowledge that it be carried on for its own sake. This law applies especially to the social sciences, for when these sciences are placed in the service of politics they can no longer serve the ideally objective truth but must become an ideology of power. How great was the tendency of Platonic philosophy in this direction is indicated by Plato's conception of truth. This doctrine of truth, which is so characteristic of his thought, together with his conception of love, can be taken as symbolic of the Platonic thought. IV The Platonic conception of truth set forth in the Republic is the doctrine which justifies, even necessitates, the lie as the means to the best government; and this implies the further dis- tinction of bad and "true" lies. A "true" lie is wholesome, a state truth, the raison d'etat. Plato says that in the ideal state (which is the state governed by Platonic philosophy), govern- ment must use many frauds and deceits for "the welfare of the governed." The necessity for lies on the part of government appears, to cite but one example, in the state regulation of birth control. The couples selected under state guidance for the purpose of propagation must be deceived in order that they will not con- sider themselves merely as instruments in the hands of the gov- ernment. They must believe that fate has destined them for one another; and for this purpose, Plato devises an ingenious sys- tem. According to his plan, parents whose children are not reared because of their inferior quality will be inclined to put</page><page sequence="17">PLATONIC JUSTICE 383 the blame upon chance rather than upon government.7 Plato excludes the painter, and also the poet who merely imitates, from his ideal state because these arts are "delusions" and not strictly true;8 yet he has not the least scruple about this mon- strous infringement upon the most intimate realm of man's life. In this personal sphere lies a vital state interest, and the interest of the state, which in the ideal state coincides with justice, is above all else in importance-even above truth itself. The max- im that "the end justifies the means" stands out quite clearly as a principle of Platonic political theory; and this maxim is a direct consequence of the primacy assumed by will over knowl- edge, by justice over truth. From the political point of view, which is of greater importance than all others, it is not so essen- tial to know whether what the subjects believe is true as it is to know whether what they believe is useful to the state, wheth- er it is to the interest of maintaining a just order in society. Therefore, Plato claims the right of government to determine the opinion of its citizens by any means which appear appro- priate. In the dialogue Laws, Plato makes a number of sur- prising proposals in this connection To cite but one example, it will be remembered that Plato, in order to engender and guarantee a suitable attitude on the part of the citizens, pro- poses to divide them into three choruses: one for boys, one for youths, and one for old men. These choruses shall be required to sing the songs which are prescribed by the government- songs embodying teachings which are of use to the state; above all, they must proclaim the teaching that justice is conducive to happiness, injustice to unhappiness. Thus the belief is propa- gated. In this connection, Plato says: "And even if the state of the case were different from what it has now proved to be by our argument, could a lawgiver who was worth his salt find any more useful fiction than this .... or one more effective in per- suading all men to act justly in all things willingly and without 7 Republic 459. 8 Ibid. 602. 9 662-66.</page><page sequence="18">384 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS constraint?"Io It is conceivable that there will be opposition to this program from the old men, for it is natural that with in- creasing years one feels a growing timidity about singing and dancing in public; thus it will be necessary to see that the mem- bers of the third or Dionysian chorus are induced to intoxication under the direction of a government official. In this drunken state they may be as easily managed as children. These state- ments are the more remarkable because Plato is clearly aware of the dangers of alcoholism and desires that the consumption of wine by the rest of the population be severely limited. He states here the famous simile of men as puppets in the hands of divinity; the divine operator of the puppet-show." In like man- ner government, which is the representative of divinity, may manipulate the wires while keeping itself invisible as far as pos- sible. The only justification of this procedure is that it is for the best interests of man-that only in this manner can justice be realized. Plato makes other proposals of the same sort, namely: that science, poetry, and religion are exclusively the servants of the state in their function as producers of ideologies. Indeed, he goes so far as to propose the suppression of all liberty of thought by instituting a state monopoly upon ideology- construction under a dictatorship to which not only the will and activity of men must submit, but also their opinions and beliefs. It is perhaps not surprising to find that Plato as a politician or theorist of politics takes a position similar to that of pragma- tism, namely, that which declares that what is useful for the state, and therefore constitutes justice, likewise constitutes truth. In his capacity as an epistemologist and psychologist, however, one cannot escape the occasional impression that Plato is making the reservation of a possible duality of truth, although he does not say so directly. How else can we explain the fact that he develops, on the one hand, his theory of ideas with a pronounced monotheistic tendency, and, at the same time, affirms the official religion of the people which with its IO Ibid. 663 (Bury). II Ibid. 643.</page><page sequence="19">PLATONIC JUSTICE 385 multiplicity of anthropomorphic gods was quite incompatible with this monotheism? Again in his theory of ideas, only the universal has eternal being, which is generally denied to par- ticulars; yet the Platonic conception of the immortality of the soul attributes eternal being to the individual personality of man in its most particular form. Further, why is it that in a work which is so extremely personal in nature as is the Sympo- sium, no reference whatever is made to the immortality of the soul in the sense of a continuation of an individual soul-sub- stance, but only reference in a figurative sense to the continua- tion of name and glory? One hesitates to suggest that only simple contradictions are to be found in the thought of such a powerful intellect as that of Plato. The inclination is rather to admit that Plato was well aware of these differences in his doctrine; that they represented for him different degrees of truth analogous to the different degrees of the Eros; that there appeared for Plato in particular a pedagogic, political, religious truth in addition to scientific rational truth. Plato considered the political religious truth to be the more important, and it therefore occupies a position of primacy in relation to rational truth. In describing how the soul reaches the other world after death, Plato says: A man of sense ought not to say, nor will I be very confident, that the description I have given of the soul and her mansions is exactly true. But I do say that, inasmuch as the soul is shown to be immortal, he may venture to think, not improperly or unworthily, that something of the kind is true. The venture is a glorious one, and he ought to comfort himself with words like these, which is the reason why I lengthen out the tale.12 When Plato teaches in the Meno that knowledge depends upon the recollection by the soul of what it has seen in the other world before its birth, he adds: "Some things I have said of which I am not altogether confident."I3 The decisive argument which he adduces in opposition to the sophistic teaching of the I2 Phaedo II4 (Jowett). I3 Meno 86 (Jowett).</page><page sequence="20">386 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS impossibility of any knowledge is that the Platonic doctrine is to be preferred because that of the Sophists "will make us idle, and is sweet only to the sluggard; but the other saying will make us active and inquisitive."I4 Plato establishes the truth of his doctrine by reference to its vital utility. It is a pedagogical political truth which he characteristically supports, not by scientific explanation, but by reference to ancient teachings of religion. This is the presupposition which one must understand before his doctrine of justice can be fully comprehended. V The dialogues written by Plato in his youth while he was yet under the influence of Socrates, wherein he treats either directly or indirectly of the problem of justice, lose themselves in a sterile analysis of concepts, in empty tautologies; they are more or less without result. Especially characteristic of this early and wholly rationalistic period of Plato's creativity is the Thrasy- machus, a work probably begun after Plato's first voyage to Syracuse. It was not entirely finished, at any rate it was not separately published; but it was later incorporated in the first book of the Republic. After a rather protracted discussion in which Socrates has tried by every available means to reach a definition of justice, this section of the Republic finally ends in Socrates' declaration that for him the result of the entire dis- cussion is merely the information that he knows nothing, for the real and decisive question as to the essence of justice has not been discussed. As long as one does not know what the just is, one can hardly arrive at a decision as to whether or not it is a virtue, or whether the just man is happy. If the assumption just made concerning the origin of the first book of the Republic be correct, then the last words constitute a transition by means of which Plato has inserted the thought of a much earlier period into a work of his adult mature years. These words reveal to 14Ibid. 8 i.</page><page sequence="21">PLATONIC JUSTICE 387 us the reason why the Thrasymcachus remained unfinished: Socrates, with all his rationalistic speculation upon concepts, had not been able to lead Plato to a knowledge of the nature of justice. When Plato left his Thrasymachus unfinished, he stood at the turning-point of his life, on the eve of a journey to southern Italy, where he became acquainted with the political and religious metaphysic of the Pythagorean school. This pythagoreanism became a new guide for him, a guide to which he remained faithful throughout the rest of his life. He believed that in pythagoreanism he had found the answer to the most burning question-the mystery of justice. The essence of the Pythagorean doctrine, which on this point agrees with the wisdom of the Orphic mysteries, is the belief that after death the soul of man will be punished for evil done and rewarded for the good. This punishment and reward may be accomplished in another world or by means of reincarnation in this world. The implication of this ethical religious con- ception, and it is the same wherever found, is a justification of the world as given, and especially of social phenomena. This results from the conviction that good will finally triumph over evil. From a political point of view, this metaphysic of a future world of souls, or metempsychosis, indicates a doctrine of jus- tice whose essence is retribution. In so far as this retribution is not realized in this world in the lives of good and bad men, it will be put off to the other world or to a second life in this world. This is the doctrine presented by Plato in his dialogue Gorgias, which was written either during his first voyage or immediately thereafter. The principal moral theses of this work are: that it is better to suffer injustice than to commit it, and that it is better to submit to legal punishment than to evade it. The final proof of these theses does not rest upon the rather doubtful demonstration of Socrates, the principal figure in this dialogue also; rather, they depend upon the splendid myth which Plato relates in conclusion, wherein he describes how the good are rewarded and the evil punished in the other world.</page><page sequence="22">388 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS This prophetic belief is first set out in the Gorgias, a belief that justice is retribution, and indeed that essentially it is retribu- tion in the other world. This conviction dominates the work of Plato from this point until his death; it constitutes the leitmotif of the second great dialogue devoted to the problem of justice, the Republic, the masterpiece of Plato which stands at the very center of his entire creativity. This work begins and ends with the myth of retribution in the other world;"5 and this conception serves as the frame of refer- ence for all that is to be said in the Republic about justice. It might appear that it is precisely in this dialogue that Plato shows an inclination to separate the idea of justice from that of retribution, for it is here that one of the speakers, Adeimantus, supports the view that justice is not adequately praised if one continues to refer only to the reward of good and the punish- ment of evil. If one is to commend justice sufficiently, he must represent it without any reference whatever to retribution. Socrates does not contradict this assertion at the time; but at the end of the dialogue he expressly repudiates this earlier tacit admission. Plato closes the Republic with an account of a story by a mysterious stranger risen from the dead, who reports the things which his soul has seen in the other world. It is the same vision, with certain digressions, as is contained in the final myth of the Gorgi as, namely, the realization of divine justice as retri- bution in the other world. Plato remained faithful to this con- ception even in his last dialogue, the Laws. The acceptance of a retribution in the other world necessarily implies a belief in the soul. In searching for justice in the other world Plato found the soul in this world, indeed found it within man. The soul must continue to live after death in a transcen- dental sphere in order that it be the object of retribution. The intimate connection between Plato's doctrines of the soul and of justice is obvious, not only in the fact that he always presents the one in conjunction with the other, especially in his principal is Republic 330-3i. This passage is generally overlooked.</page><page sequence="23">PLATONIC JUSTICE 389 work on the doctrine of the soul, the Phaedo, but likewise in the modifications through which the doctrine of soul passes. This is indicated by the transition of the conception of soul as a unity to the conception of the tripartite soul; and this transition is parallel to corresponding modifications in the doctrine of jus- tice. As the problem of justice inevitably leads to the doctrine of the soul, so this latter leads to the doctrine of ideas. The be- lief in the realization of justice in the other world compels the conception of a future existence of the soul; the necessity of a cognition of the nature of justice leads to the conception of a pre-existence of the soul, to the theory of knowledge as reminis- cence by the soul of what it has been in the other world before its birth to this world. This theory is developed for the first time in the Meno; and here lies the germ of the doctrine of ideas. What the soul has seen in its pre-existence is ideas, and above all, the idea of justice. While Plato identifies justice with retribution, he does not merely take over the Orphic, Pythagorean doctrines, but he adduces as the basis of his view the notion of the Greek people which has come down from antiquity. It might appear, and it may so have seemed to Plato when he wrote the Gorgias, that with the formula of retribution he has given the answer to the question concerning the nature of justice. But this answer is only an apparent answer; it gives no real information as to the nature of justice. Fundamentally it describes only the actual function of positive law, which merely connects the facts of injustice in one of the deeds conceived as evil with the com- pulsory consequences of that injustice. It only reflects the ex- ternal structure of the existing social order which is a system of sanctions; and this order is justified by representing the mecha- nism of guilt and punishment as a special case of the general law of retribution, i.e., as the will of divinity. Taken by itself the concept of retribution is just as meaningless as is that of equality, which is usually considered to be the characteristic of justice. Indeed, justice is itself the formula of equality, since</page><page sequence="24">390 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS it says nothing more than that the good will be for the good, evil for the evil; that like is for like, which, in its primitive meaning, amounts to saying "To each his due." But what is the good, what exactly is the nature of that good of which evil must be the negation? This decisive question remains unanswered. The question as to the nature of justice thus resolves into the question concerning the nature of the good. This is exactly the turn taken by the problem of justice in the doctrine of ideas; for the central idea-the idea from which all other ideas derive their illumination, the idea which lies beyond the sphere of all other ideas in a realm of pure being-is the idea of the good. It appears thus in every representation of the doctrine of ideas given by Plato in his great dialogue on justice, the Republic. Here the relation between good and justice is in- dicated by the determination of justice according to its "use- fulness" or practicability, which is to say that the idea of justice derives its only value from the idea of the good.'6 The good is thus the substance of justice, and for this reason Plato fre- quently identifies them. If these two be separated, then jus- tice, as retribution, is merely the technique for the realization of the good. Then justice, in so far as it refers to earthly mat- ters, is the state, functioning as the apparatus of retribution. It is the state which must guarantee the triumph of good over evil in this world. Since the good is strictly a social category, it follows that it is only in the state that man can act in conformity with the good; indeed, it is only in the state that man as its organ can even know the good. Therefore, it appears that the dialogue which names itself "the State" is designed to furnish an answer to the question concerning the substance of justice. Therefore, the central point of the Republic is in the explication of the problem of the good; and it is for this reason that the cul- mination of this work on the state is the theory of ideas, the highest of which appears to be the idea of the good. What the good actually is, however, one does not learn from 16 Ibid. 505.</page><page sequence="25">PLATONIC JUSTICE 391 this dialogue, which confines itself to the affirmation that the good exists. The whole grandiose heaven of ideas which is erected beyond the earthly world is but the philosophical and poetical expression of this affirmation. Thus this construction of the ideal state which Plato outlines in the Republic is no solution of the material problems concerning the nature of justice. It is a misapprehension to assume that Plato's account of the true state furnishes the finished plan of a state order. Nor is this what Plato intended-at least in the beginning. The description of an ideal state is not the principal problem of the Republic; indeed only a small part of the work is devoted to this subject. If Plato does present a state "arising in thought before our eyes," it is because he presumes an analogy between the state and man, and believes that man can be understood the easier if viewed in the larger proportions of the state. Thus he seeks the good constitution, the suitable relationship between the individual parts of the soul; and this, as later appears, is not itself justice, but the presupposition of man acting justly. Plato mainly represents the state as just this constitution and organization, not as a completely regulated order of material human relations. In the life of society, he shows only the condi- tions of organization under which life will presumably be shaped to the ends of justice; but he does not explicate this justly regulated life itself, nor does he indicate the multiplicity of norms which regulate human relationships, and themselves con- stitute the essence of justice. Further, the constitution of the ideal state, from a legal point of view, is scarcely more than a fragment which leaves all decisive questions in doubt. Especial- ly is there no trace to be found of a solution of the social-political problem. The measure concerning the community of goods, of women and children, which is applicable only to the compara- tively small social strata of warriors and philosophers, has sig- nificance only as an organizing factor. This measure has as its purpose the education and selection of leaders and has nothing at all to do with economic or political communism. No norm is</page><page sequence="26">392 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS to be found for the regulation of the people who submit to the two reigning classes. Here everything is left to the individual decisions and decrees of the government, which consists of the philosophers who, because of their education, know the good and therefore will it. But in what does this good consist that is to be realized in government? What is the substance of the acts of governing? Only from the answer to these questions can one learn the constitution of justice. Plato himself says that the description of the tripartite divi- sion of the social organism as the constitution of the true state shall in no wise be taken as an answer to the question concerning the nature of justice. This demonstrates the particularity of his method, the continual postponement of the solution of prob- lems. At the very beginning of the conversation, Plato allows Socrates, who is to give the solution, to make a statement which in itself precludes all finality and certainty in anything that may follow: "Why how, my dear fellow, could anyone answer, if in the first place he did not know and did not even profess to know, and secondly, even if he had some notion of the matter, he had been told by a man of weight that he mustn't give any of his suppositions as an answer?"'7 This is not merely a statement dictated by modesty. The mysterious intimation of an obliga- tion to silence means that what Plato might say concerning justice-apart from the refutation of false opinion-would not possess final truth, that his exposition could not penetrate to reality. That this is its meaning is confirmed by the content of the dialogue. After the constitution of the ideal state and its three classes is set out, there is no statement that: This is the justice for which we have been searching. The general principle which re- sults from this constitution, namely, that each shall do only his own work, the principle of the division of labor (which is suit- able here as in every constitution which distributes competence according to different organs)-this principle is not admitted 17 Ibid. 337 (Shorey).</page><page sequence="27">PLATONIC JUSTICE 393 unreservedly to be the principle of justice. Rather, there is pro- posed an examination as to whether this principle may be ap- plied to a comparison between the state and the individual soul. "But if not," it is said, "then we will look for something else."'8 It is apparent that Plato is aware from the beginning that the attempt to arrive at the nature of justice by means of an analogy between state and individual will not succeed, at least not completely. This is indeed the case. After the parallel has been established and the three parts of the soul which corre- spond to the three parts of the state have been found, one might believe that the answer to the question of the nature of justice is obvious, even though not particularly significant. This an- swer would be that the three parts of the soul-the rational, the spirited, and that which is imprisoned in the appetite-each of these shall exercise its proper function and none other. In this connection Socrates declares: "In my opinion, we shall never in the world apprehend this matter from such methods as we are now employing in discussion. For there is another longer and harder way that conducts to this."'9 As a matter of fact he does not take this other way; he is satisfied for the present to continue with his inexact method. This leads to the conclusion that just action results in the true state when the philosophers, with the help of the warriors, rule over the artisan class in the same manner in which the individual man arrives at just action by governing his passions with the rational part of the soul, in which he is assisted by the spirited element. Just action thus results from activity which is accompanied by reason. The question of the substance of justice is referred to the substance of reason. There follows a comparison of justice with the well- being of the soul, which means nothing more than the right constitution of the soul, and is therefore not enlightening as to the analogy between the soul and state constitutions. After a rather long digression from the proper subject of justice, Socrates returns to his observation that actually a longer and I8 lbid. 434. i91lbid. 35.</page><page sequence="28">394 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS more detailed way is necessary in order to understand the nature of justice. Thus at a somewhat advanced stage of the dialogue (we are already in the sixth book), the knowledge which has thus far been attained concerning the nature of justice is again dis- avowed. The peculiarity of the method which Plato uses in treating of the problem of justice appears clearly here. Just as one appears to have arrived at an answer to the question, the position at- tained is abandoned; the result obtained is withdrawn as inexact or erroneous, and the end is again postponed. At this point of the discussion Plato makes use of his peculiar technique by sub- stituting for the concept of justice that of the good, as he had earlier substituted the concept of reason. The question as to the nature of justice becomes then the question as to the nature of the good; but when Socrates finds it necessary to answer the question "How do you account for the good?", he repeats the play begun at the beginning of the discussion when he was first asked the question as to the nature of justice. He declares again that he knows nothing, and seeks to evade the question, so that his companion in the discussion, Glaucon, exclaims: "In heav- en's name, Socrates, do not draw back, as it were, at the very goal. For it will content us if you explain the good even as you set forth the nature of justice, sobriety, and the other virtues." Again the expected result is discredited as not final; and Socrates makes fertile use of the admission that the good can be defined only inexactly, for he declares: "Let us dismiss for the time being the nature of the Good in itself; for to attain to my present surmise of that seems a pitch above the impulse that wings my flight today.' 20 Plato has left "the nature of the Good in itself" in this unsatisfactory state, not only for the present, but for eternity, and not only in the Republic, but in all the other dialogues. He never answers the question. Instead of speaking of the good, Socrates will only talk about the offspring of the good, of the son who is "most nearly made 20 Ibid. 5o6.</page><page sequence="29">PLATONIC JUSTICE 395 in its likeness." So the son takes the place of the father just as reason took the place of justice and was itself replaced by the good. This method of substitution has as its purpose the eleva- tion of the object of the discussion, justice, to a degree of divinity in order that the question concerning its essential na- ture may thereby be evaded. Indeed, it appears in this passage that the good is for Plato the highest invisible divinity. In truth, that which we seek is Divinity. Therefore questions about its essential nature are vain and impious. Discussion is thus cut short and the issue piously evaded. At the most, we can only speak of the visible son and thus perhaps gain an in- sight into the nature of the father. This son of the good is the sun, and as such is itself a god. Plato can say nothing of this god other than that he represents in the realm of the visible what the idea of the good represents in the realm of the conceivable. Again, nothing is said as to the nature or substance of the good, but only something concerning its position as the supreme au- thority. The good is, and the highest of all. What it is, of what it consists, what is its criterion, how it can be recognized in human activities or in the social order, and thus what is its decisive nature for social theory and practice- these questions remain unanswered. The philosopher who rules in the ideal state will know the good. Others must be content to worship and obey. To be sure, Plato prescribes a plan for the education of the philosophers appointed to rule. Under the proposed discipline dialectic is accorded the most important position. Dialectic is characterized by Plato as an art abstracted from all sensuous experience, which separates and relates concepts. It will lead the philosopher to the very boundary, but only to the boundary, of the knowable; it will not lead him to his specific goal-the idea of the good. The idea of the good lies beyond all being, and therefore beyond all rational or scientific knowledge. The reali- zation of the good is reserved to another power of the soul. Considering what Plato has said in the Symposium, in the</page><page sequence="30">396 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS Phaedrus, and especially in Epistle VII, one must represent the vision of the highest idea of the good as an intuitive act of sudden illumination which occurs in a moment of ecstasy. Plato describes the experience as follows: "As a result of con- tinued application to the subject itself and communion there- with, it is brought to birth in the soul on a sudden, as light that is kindled by a leaping spark, and thereafter it nourishes it- self."12I What Plato here describes is a religious experience. The rational speculation about concepts affords no direct access to this experience; dialectic is rather to be understood as a spiritual exercise similar to that of prayer. The knowledge of the good does not follow as a logical conclusion of the dialectical process; but it is an allotment of grace to the soul which has purified itself of all sensuality by meditation. Since Plato rejects all experience acquired through the outer senses as giving comprehension of the highest idea of the divine good, he must attain this comprehension through some experi- ence other than that of the senses. It is not possible to have even an inner knowledge without any experience whatever; and there must therefore be an inner sense which makes this specific religious experience possible. This inner experience is specifical- ly distinguished from the outer in that not everyone is capable of it as everyone is capable of the outer experience. Inner knowledge is possible only to a very small elite, perhaps only to a single person blessed by God. Such a person will value this experience because it brings him closer to divinity, elevating him above other men. For this reason the religious experience derived from such a rare inner sense cannot be expressed ra- tionally in concepts as can the experience of the outer senses; nor can it be conveyed to others. Here it becomes self-evident that Plato can give no answer to the question concerning the absolute good which is the object of his religious experience. The essence of his God remains inexpressible. Thus may we understand Plato's statement in Epistle VII that there have 21 Epistle VII 34I (Bury).</page><page sequence="31">PLATONIC JUSTICE 397 been no writings from him on these questions, nor will there be any, "for it does not at all admit of verbal expression like other studies." It is not surprising that a philosopher should conceal his knowledge of the absolute good as inexpressible, or place it within the frame of an esoteric philosophy. Can this be ad- mitted though when the philosopher is called upon to rule over the state and to be the maker of laws? Plato, however, does not shrink from the consequences which this involves. As it is neither possible nor permissible to write anything concerning matters of final importance, so one must assume that the law- giver has not put into the laws all that is of supreme importance to him, but that he has kept this in the most sacred shrine of his heart.22 The secret of justice cannot be disclosed, not even in the laws of the best of law-givers. The final conclusion of Platonic wisdom, the answer given again and again throughout the dialogues to the question of the nature of justice, is this: It is the divine mystery. Because there is no answer, the question itself must finally be rejected as inadmissible. If one may rely upon Epistle II as a source, Plato has written a reply to the question concerning the nature of the good or divinity. He says here that the ques- tion as to the highest good is a question as to its qualities, and divinity has no qualities. T his very question, Plato suggests, is the source of all unhappiness because of the pain it causes to the soul. Man must deliver himself from this query if he hopes to participate in truth. This is the final consequence which re- sults from the transcendentalism of the good and from its elevation to divinity; even the question concerning its nature becomes meaningless. The Sophists had skeptically denied the existence of an ab- solute justice; Socrates had asserted it passionately and dog- matically, but was finally forced to confess that he did not know what it really was. Plato declares that one may attain this 22 Ibid. 344.</page><page sequence="32">398 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS knowledge through his philosophy; but he also says that the result will be inexpressible, that the question will remain un- answered, indeed, that the question is not even valid. Thus the road which was to lead from rationalistic relativism to the meta- physical absolute ends in religious mysticism. It has been disputed that Plato was a mystic, and it may in fact be doubted. His philosophy has a pronounced social char- acter; his doctrine of ideas, which culminates in the idea of justice, clearly has a political orientation. Genuine mysticism, on the other hand, is asocial; the mystical experience isolates the individual from all others. In as much as God and the world are absorbed in the subjective experience of an isolated indi- vidual, the presupposition of all society is lost, namely, the opposition of I and You. There remains in the mystical expe- rience only the all-embracing I which has been raised to the status of divinity. Therein lies the individual salvation sought by the mystic. He has no desire to reform the world, and espe- cially not the social world, but endeavors to deliver himself from it. He must extinguish all will, and especially the will to power, in order that he may be enabled to receive divinity with- in himself. The experience which he seeks, coalescence of the I with God, is for him the final goal-not the means to a social end. In fact, Plato's teaching is a genuine mysticism at its most decisive point, for the vision of highest being is inexpressible, i.e., it is an experience which is not communicable and not the product of rational mediation. He who has seen the good, the chosen one, the object of grace, is isolated from the many who neither have, nor ever can, behold this vision. Just at the point in Plato's philosophy when one expects an objective solution, there appears merely a formula for personal salvation. The aspect of Plato's thought which carries it beyond the frame of mystical speculation, raising it above the limits of a mere individual salvation, is the aim or goal of his mystical experience. Plato seeks the truth concerning good and evil; jus-</page><page sequence="33">PLATONIC JUSTICE 399 tice is the object of the vision which penetrates the mystery; and this vision, which makes its appearance only to the philos- opher, is the justification of the philosopher's exclusive right to rule. In Epistle VII, Plato so energetically emphasizes the eso- teric character of his doctrine and the mystical nature of its mysteries that it appears he must deny to it any social function whatever. Yet here again he maintains his former demand that the philosopher, and only the philosopher, be appointed to rule. That appears to be a complete contradiction. How can a long- ing for individual salvation and a claim of recognition as ruler find a place in the same system? Well, they obviously found a place in the same breast, indicating a mutual endurance in some kind of rational compromise effected between their op- position. The salvation of the chosen one-he who is blessed by grace- will be accomplished by the vision of the good; but this, the secret of the ruler, will also accomplish salvation for all others, i.e., for those who are ruled. These cannot follow their ruler along the path of salvation to a vision of the good, and for this reason they are completely excluded from ruling. They can find salvation only in complete submission to the authority of the ruler who alone knows the good and who thus wills it. Since the ruling philosopher has a knowledge of the divine good and is unique in the possession of this secret, he is entirely different from other men. The mass of the people, who have no political rights, are not allowed to observe divinity directly; they have no choice but to believe in the wisdom and grace of the ruler. This belief is the ground of the unconditional obedience of sub- jects upon which the authority of the Platonic state rests. Plato's mysticism, the most complete expression of the irra- tional, is the justification of his antidemocratic politic; it is the ideology of every autocracy. This philosophy, which has led from Platonic love through Platonic truth to Platonic justice, and which operates under the compulsion of an immanent legality, shows us that rational</page><page sequence="34">400 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS science can never give an answer to the question concerning the nature of justice. Philosophy not only fails to give an answer but leads to the conclusion that the question itself is not valid. The final position it will take in all its different forms is that there is no such thing as absolute justice: it cannot be deter- mined conceptionally. Such an ideal is an illusion. There are only interests and conflicts of interests, which are either com- promised into harmony or left in a state of strife. Within the sphere of reason the idea of justice vanishes, leaving only the idea of peace. The concept which can stand the scrutiny of reason is not justice but peace. Justice resides, nevertheless, despite all reason, in man's heart. The need and the desire of man for a justice that is more than compromise and more than mere restraining of potential enemies defy the attempts of reason to exorcise the ideal of justice as a dangerous illusion. Man's belief in a higher law and in a supreme good remains forever unshaken. History is a wit- ness to the actual indestructibility of this belief. If the belief be an illusion, then is illusion indeed stronger than reality. For most men-perhaps for all men-there are some problems which cannot be translated into theoretical puzzles to be solved by analysis of concepts, some issues which cannot be posed as ques- tions to be answered by reason. That men will ever be satisfied with the answer of the Sophists is not likely. Men will continue to search out the religious road along which Plato struggled, even though it be a road of blood and tears. GENEVA</page></plain_text>
