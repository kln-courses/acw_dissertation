<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter Straub 's Shadowland: The Initiation of a Magician Edwin F. Casebeer ETER Straub's Shadow- land presents us a syncretic version of magical initiation which inte- grates European and, peripherally, Carribbean voodoo magical systems with neo-Platonic metaphysics and Jungian psychoanalyti- cal theory. Although there is some suggestion of the shamanistic, the correspondences between it and modern European occult sys- tems is owing more to a shared psychological foundation, "the mythic approaches to human consciousness" (Drury xii). The nov- el's emphasis upon the natural world and its creatures reaches back more to the Celtic roots and primeval European forests than to an American, African, or Asian topography. Nor does the novel, al- though it opposes a patriarchal magical system, draw upon a femi- nist spiritualistic tradition such as that expressed in Starhawk's Truth or Dare- perhaps because Straub wrote in 1978. The resultant syn- thesis of druidic, voodoo, and modern occult traditions combined with "inventions of the author" (Straub 3) is revolutionary, for the author's broader purpose is to extoll the individual and critique the values and dynamics of institutions, specifically the educational in- stitution, which emerges as an antagonist force, whether secular or magical. Although he rejects its contemporary system as corrupt (particularly for its emphasis on the gain and use of power), Straub represents earlier magical systems as effective in developing an indi- vidual's spiritual nature to the point that it could access a magical re- ality, the fundamental reality of the universe. Today, however, the magician must become self-educated in a process that is similar to the self-education of the contemporary artist, particularly through the development of the imagination, especially its ability to manipu- late images- on the premise that the image is what it represents. The proper goal of such a magician is to gain awareness. Godhood 93</page><page sequence="2">The Initiation of a Magician Journal of the Fantastic is total consciousness (and thus total being) rather than total power, a comparatively minor achievement and one "which invariably leads to misuse of the energies attained and the downfall and degradation of the individual" (Deaver 63). While the resolution of the magical contest between Coleman Collins and the novelist's protagonist, Tom Flanagan, has some overtones of the apocalyptic battle be- tween Antichrist and Christ, the emphasis is upon Tom's initiation as a magician, not upon his consequent achievements. Shadowland requires the reader to share pyschologically Tom's initiation. Straub so handles his material that the reader experiences magic directly, for instance, as a seduction, as an adventure, as dis- orientation of time/space realities, as hallucination, as fantasy, as danger, as horror, as serenity. To produce these experiences, Straub chooses a limited third person focus that restricts us largely to Tom's consciousness. Collins is, for Tom and us, a mystery and a danger; and as the mystery clarifies, the danger increases (to the extent that we have made an effective identification with the protagonist). Cer- tainly, Straub risks creating a disorienting novel with the impact of a hallucinogenic experience as Collins repeatedly dupes Tom (and thus the reader) about his location in time and space. But part of his effort is, like that of John Fowles in The Magus, to dim for us any clear lines that might exist between consensus reality and the arche- typical reality that he posits. Like Fowles, Straub answers the ques- tion, "Does or does not the magical exist?" with a Buddha smile: "Yes. " The major achievement of this novel as a psychological ex- perience is its careful eradication of the boundaries that the material- istic rationalist places about diurnal reality and Straub's delicate, allusive creation of an alternate, analogical, macrocosomic reality to which idealists from Plato to Jung (including the medieval, renais- sance, and contemporary occult magician) might consent. The novel consists of a brief prologue, three parts, and a brief epilogue. In the prologue, "Note: Tom in the Zanzibar," the anonymous writer (hereafter, "Straub") proposes to a former schoolmate and current nightclub magician, Tom Flanagan, a book presenting a strange summer which Tom experienced at Shadow- land, the Vermont estate of the magician Coleman Collins; "Part One: The School" presents Tom's freshman year in Carson, an Ari- zona prep school for privileged boys between fifteen and eighteen. 94</page><page sequence="3">in the Arts Edwin F. Casebeer There he meets another young amateur magician, Del, and aids him in his struggle with the crazed and murderous high school bully, Skeleton Ridpath. Del invites him to his uncle's Vermont estate, Shadowland. Sensing further danger for the boy, Tom accepts. In "Part Two: Shadowland" Collins subjects the boys to a series of confusing and sometimes brutal experiences, all the while pitching them against one another, and making every effort to dominate Tom, whom he seems to favor. The section closes with the appear- ance of a girl in Collins's employ, Rose, who urges Tom to escape and to persuade Del to follow. At that point he becomes Collins's antagonist. In "Part Three: 'When We All Lived in the Forest,"' Straub intensifies and brutalizes the action: the conflict between Tom and Collins resolves with Collins's crucifying Tom and mur- dering Del, Tom magically trapping Collins and destroying him by burning down Shadowland. The novel closes with Rose's mysteri- ous disappearance. In the epilogue, "Straub" visits the only other survivor of these events, Skeleton, and the grounds of Shadowland, especially Rose's favorite locale, a beach; he becomes convinced of the reality of the story's more fantastic elements. The broad outline of Shadowland' s plot follows an anthropo- logical model. The initiation of the magician, whether European, Caribbean, or African, has a recurrent pattern: the candidate is dif- ferentiated from others by temperament and by experience of vi- sions, withdraws from society to a topography that provides solitude, undergoes "privations with psychological and neuropathic consequences", encounters Spiritual beings which may be anthropomorphic or animal, ma- levolent or protective, solitary or numerous, appear to him with increasing frequency and teach him the substance of his profes- sion. Dying, the candidate journeys to the world of "the spirits, the gods, or the dead" and there "learns its topography and acquires the knowledge necessary to subdue the evil spirits and obtain the assis- tance of the good ones" (van Gennep 108-110). Similarly, in Part One Tom is distinguished, selected by Del and Collins; in Part Two undergoes exhausting experiences at Shadowland and the visitation of many "spiritual beings"; and in Part Three undergoes crucifixion and revives through his ability to embrace Death and internalize it, 95</page><page sequence="4">The Initiation of a Magician Journal of the Fantastic upon which he returns to defeat Collins and his allies. At this point, there is a minor ambiguity: for Collins, the final struggle is for a kingship that must result in the death of one of the contestants as de- scribed by Frazer in The Golden Bough. But Tom rejects the monar- chy and, like the above-described magicians, undertakes daily practice and study of the art; for him, the struggle is to save the lives of his friend and himself. In either event, the anthropological pat- terns hold, for the initiation of both magician and king are simi- lar-up to the ordination of the latter (van Gennep 110). These conflicting agenda create the ambiguous center of Shad- owland : the teacher seeks to rule, not to teach. A central thematic strand of Shadowland is the corruption of the modern teacher. Tom tells the anonymous novelist to begin his story of the strange summer with an account of Tom's first year at Carson, ostensibly to establish the foundation of his relationship to the Nightingale family. But the effect is to create a mirroring between the novel's two settings: Car- son and Shadowland, both of which undertake the boys' education and both of which are self-indulgent and self-serving hierarchies, the relationship not only implicit but connected by the occasional references which connect the headmaster, Laker Broome, with Coleman Collins and a seductive demon which visits Tom in vi- sions. On the surface, Carson is an expensive private Arizona boys' preparatory school which promises to initiate its fifteen-year-old freshmen into their moneyed class, providing them with the values, goals, and social techniques appropriate for America's next genera- tion of institutional captains. We hear of no successes: Del and Brick die young, each the victim of an educational process; Marcus Reilly, a schoolmate, does become a lawyer but ends involved in the Miami gangland, and finally as a suicide in his thirties; the one "suc- cess," Bobby Hollingsworth, is a fat, self-indulgent narcissist who married into money and manufactures urinals: "whenever you took a leak in the Southeast, you could read his name just by looking down" (236). Carson would not claim the two unqualified successes before us: the magician Tom and the artist "Straub"- they are self- taught. Carson provides only for a degenerate power elite living in a material reality. Ironically, insanely, so does Shadowland. For Collins, magic is only a tool, like money. The only game is power. 96</page><page sequence="5">in the Arts Edwin F. Casebeer Carson's power structure is not as it seems. The presiding head- master is erratic and cruel; he allows the development of a cadre that systematically intimidates and humiliates the students. The one con- sistent goal is the desire of the power elite to remain powerful- at any cost. When any achievement occurs at the school- such as Tom's heroism at a fire- the headmaster takes credit. The real dy- namic is as primitive as it always has been: power goes to the strong. Skeleton Ridpath, the deranged school bully (a mirror him- self of Laker Broome in his instability), rules all the young boys be- cause of his strength, his unswerving rage, and his commitment to the chaos and disjunction typical of the alchemical skeleton (Cirlot 298). At an archetypical level, we discover through the novel's per- sistent metaphors that Carson, which we last see in flames, is Hell, the headmaster an avatar of Satan, and the bully of Death. Shadowland mirrors Carson- and vice versa, for with Shadow- land we move into the reality behind reality, the substance behind the material, the archetypes themselves. Still, at the apex of the sys- tem are corruption, madness, self-indulgence, and greed: Coleman Collins. His pathological use of his power corrupts the Green Wood at its heart. Like Laker Broome, Coleman Collins advertises initia- tion, a transformation from boy to magician: during the summer at his estate, Shadowland, he promises to hone the boys' natural pow- ers into the magician's skills and from the pair he will choose his own successor as the world's greatest magician, its king sitting on the owl throne. In reality, he has murdered Del's parents and pro- poses to murder Del to gain total control of the family's immense fortune and, recognizing Tom as the possessor of a natural magical power seldom seen in the world's history, he intends either to subju- gate Tom to himself and/or to gain it for himself to advance his true goal- godhood. Like Carson, Shadowland has a curriculum (151): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Trance Theatrics Flight Voice Rise Transparence Silence Altered Landscape 97</page><page sequence="6">The Initiation of a Magician Journal of the Fantastic Level 4 Level 5 Level 6 Window of Flame Collector Ghostly Presence Window of Ice Mind over Matter Living Statue Mind Control Fish Breathing Level 7 Level 8 Level 9 Altered Time Put a Hurting Wood Green Empire Created Landscape Conjure Minor Devils Desired Fireworks The dynamic of the Shadowland sections is to produce for Tom and for us phenomena at these levels. Protagonist and reader are to learn (1) that a magical reality exists; (2) we can enter it; (3) we can mas- ter techniques to wield the power we find there; and (4) we can evolve past humanity toward godhood. But, like Carson, Shadowland doesn't deliver. Collins does not intend to teach the boys; he intends to exploit them. In fact, a sub- stantial part of the magical education suggested by the preceding curriculum is, as Level 1 (Trance) might suggest, achieved through hypnosis and, perhaps, hallucinogenic drugs. More, we eventually learn, is arranged through hired actors and simple staging enhanced by trance (Level 2's "theatrics"). Whereas, the protagonist and the reader experience all nine levels, many of them to such an extent that they could serve as chapter titles, the experiences happen to us and not /or us. We are never privileged to enter Collins's mind. We ex- perience the whole novel through the mind of its anonymous author who then, by interview and intuition, maneuvers us into experienc- ing the novel through Tom's mind. If Collins teaches Tom, he does so as a model- he does what he does and is what he is. Tom learns that beneath the illusion is real magic. But he has to work out for himself how to perform it. If Tom doesn't learn through explicit instruction in the tech- niques listed in Collins's curriculum, yet he does learn through an- other agency: the story. So do we, delicately and obliquely- or if we should be so inclined, not at all. Underlying Straub' s novel is his supposition that, properly executed, story is a magical act. Thus the novel itself, a magical act, is imbedded with stories: the hidden his- tory of the world, itself imbedded into a meta-story; the magician's autobiography, and a constellation of fairy tales, themselves in- tended as doorways into the magical realm. In helping "Straub" tell 98</page><page sequence="7">in the Arts Edwin F. Casebeer the story of Shadowland, Tom regards it "as a problem in structure, like his act" (7), thereby laying for us the connections between magical and narrative performances, both of which create another reality out of available imagery, obtained by the imagination and structured by the mind. In other words, our reading of the novel is a magical process, one which Straub works to enhance through obliq- uity, mystification, and hidden agendas. Thus the author presents us and enables us to project into Tom's story as it happens to Tom so that we share his educational process- albeit the education is not in- stitutionally maneuvered and part of the education is that its institu- tion is its major barrier. Thus the novel is really a parable, a narrative embodying a mystery to be teased out in individual ways suitable to the individual approaching it and being mirrored by it. The clue that the novel is a parable (a proposition that "Straub" does not state) is that it contains many stories and that the characters do regard these as parables. To the extent that Collins does any teaching at all, it is through these stories. A major story among these is Collins' s own story and through it the story of the reality be- hind ours, Level 9, the Wood Green Empire; for, as "Straub" writes at the novel's beginning: The true beginning of this story is not "More than twenty years ago, an underrated," etc., but, "Once upon a time ... or, Long ago, when we all lived in the forest .... Of course, the novel does not present- even in Coll ins' s autobiogra- phy-a straightforward exposition of the history behind history. In- stead, it forces us to deduce much of it, to pull the scattered detail into our own stories. To me, what it implies is the reality of a Pla- tonic Ideal (specifically a Jungian archetypical reality) and the power of the analogical mind, the imagination, literature, in getting to it. As a culture we long ago lost that knowledge though, until the age of material rationalism, cults (including Christianity) did pre- serve it. Now the human most knowledgeable- Collins- has de- stroyed all about him and uses his magic as our culture uses its science- as a weapon. Constellated about this hidden story are the stories which em- body it and through which we must see as we individually see. Cen- tral is Collins's own apprehension of the hidden story, a vision of man whose talents became corrupted and maddened by the fall of 99</page><page sequence="8">The Initiation of a Magician Journal of the Fantastic Western Civilization and the horror of World War I, a man who be- gan as a healer and ended as a murderer. Thus Collins's story be- comes a story of how true power has existed and been gotten in the world. But Tom's story counterbalances the reality of the carnivore with that of the hermit wizard whom he encounters in a dream forest just before his entry into Carson (15-17). For him, the hidden story tells, finally, of soul and serenity, of service and harmony, of love. Between Collins's and Tom's stories are interpolated an anthol- ogy of fairy tales. "Straub," who quotes from Roger Sale's Fairy Tales and After in one of his epigraphs, is clearly struck not only by Sale's belief that they have a common source, the "foot of the great narrative tree, where stories can, as if by a kind of natural magic, go anywhere" (47) but by his insistence that in fairy tales, as in Straub's Shadowland, the lines between magic and "reality" are eradicated (31), a condition that he seeks to emulate in his novel. Through a reader response, I will exemplify the dynamics of one such story. Tom insists that "Straub" begin his novel with the tale of the King of Cats (7), a story told Tom and Del by Collins upon their arrival at Shadowland: a traveler tells his friend of witnessing cats in a strange funeral procession whereon the companion's pet cat shouts, "Then I am the King of Cats!" and disappears up the chim- ney. (9-10) The tale accomplishes the following for me: (1) it sug- gests that there is an alien reality behind mine (interestingly, I just now corrected a most significant typo: "behind mind"); (2) that re- ality is hierarchical and monarchical; (3) its structure cyclically re- news; (4) its King is a predator and a carnivore. The novel reifies, for me, these conclusions and uses the story to produce one of its major subterranean metaphors, the bird metaphor made explicit as Collins ends his story to the boys: "It happened, my friends- yes, it happened, my charming little birds. " (7, 9-10) Thus humanity splits into cats and birds- and the cat is King. Psychologically, I appre- hend the tale as presenting to me the possibility that within my psy- che lies sleeping an unempowered cat, a latent magical force that awaits the touch of history to become Cat, a fabulous monarchic predatory ego motivated entirely by Power. Upon that empower- ment, immediately within me Cat encounters Bird, which as the novel develops its avian metaphor, becomes psyche, soul. The la- tent conflict then is between monarchic, aggressive, predatory, ma- 100</page><page sequence="9">in the Arts Edwin F. Casebeer terialistic Id and passive Soul moving through the joys of flight and the beauty of song into timelessness, eternity- as a glass sparrow. And thus through the agency of a simple fairy tale is presented the psychic agenda of the novel: the seed of cat blooms into the dark and dying old magician Collins which actually does devour Soul (Del) and can only be retained by a synthesis of cat and bird- Tom who can hate and act but will do so only in the context of the ultimate goal, a serene consciousness that through the practice of his art en- ables (not empowers) him in the cosmos and the cosmos in him- and, to the extent which we the audience apprehend his acts, in us. At the deepest level, the story presents for us our internal con- flict between id and psyche. Though such stories provide him a compass, Tom must learn from experience how to access the world of the stories. He must learn two fundamental occult laws: " Energy follows thought " and " Thought plus emotion equals manifestation" (Deaver 20, 23). He learns how to manipulate through imagery the amorphous substance underlying the material and thus to impact the material world itself. This achievement becomes manifest in Part Three, where after Col- lins crucifies him and Tom, like the magicians van Gennep de- scribes, enters another world and conquers death; and, then, as Jung might recommend, he gains the power and the focus to return to the world to defeat Collins by three internalizations of archetypical per- sonae: the Shadow, the Child, and the Anima. Tom's first internalization is a triumph over the Shadow by love and acceptance. Collins has captured Skeleton Ridpath, the school bully, in the persona of the Collector through which he "puts a hurt- ing" on his enemies. As Skeleton attempts to execute the boy, Tom understands that "Skeleton was a broken-away and unwanted piece of himself' : I am your room, he sends into Skeleton's mind, taking responsibil- ity for it all. His mind and Skeleton's are nearly one- your room is me- and Tom knows with true and certain finality that in saying this he has finally become a magician ... He has welcomed him- self. (421) His second internalization is the archetype of the Child, the puer eternus, as represented by his boyhood friend, Del. Throughout the novel, Del's well-being has motivated Tom's actions, not a desire 101</page><page sequence="10">The Initiation offa Magician Journal off the Fantastic for magical achievement. This commitment remains strong and pure through all his tribulations and becomes the beacon toward which he strives and, thus striving, incidentally becomes the Magi- cian. Finally, Del helps him: as the sparrow, "the messenger of spirit" (440) into which Collins has made him, he tracks the true Collins among all his manifestations so that Tom can pin him and de- stroy him. In its last moments, the sparrow's song cascaded folly out, spearing Tom with what Del was bring- ing forth from his trapped soul, the liquid and overflowing song which was Del's only speech. Then Collins transforms the boy /sparrow further into glass. Thus, the boy as soul receives "a place in the eternal" (444). The actual internalization of the boy/soul awaits Tom's inter- nalization of Rose, his anima. At the bridge that crosses from child- hood (Del) to sexuality (Rose), Tom manages to keep the chief values of the one without discarding the other. Appearing early at the end of Part Two, Rose is the customary guide to the underworld. Belonging to Collins, she is one of the novel's key mysteries: is she another one of his human hirelings or is she a transformed mermaid? And whether she is the one or the other, is she faithful or a traitor? Like the traditional anima, she becomes Tom's guide to the under- world over which Collins presides and can lead him to the magic weapons he must learn to wield. That accomplished, the battle won, the mermaid having led the magician from the place of destruction through the tunnels to her beach on the lake, the two fall asleep: They did not make love. Tom was content to hold her, to feel the petal skin of her shoulder, the curve of her skull beneath his hands. He could have sung like Del, in his friend's last moments, of the perfection of such things ... In eternity they were married. (454) Straub here delicately maneuvers us to accept a final integration: the eternal soul (Del) and the eternal love combining in itself beauty (the petal) and death (the skull). Before Rose slips back into the lake (into which he will slip the glass sparrow when he awakes), she whispers into his sleeping mind his final validation as a magician: that message would have joined his bloodstream like Del's final song and would have been impossible to reconstruct into ordinary flawed human speech. And again like Del's song, which was an expression of completion and the end of change, it would have 102</page><page sequence="11">in the Arts Edwin F. Casebeer spoken of, would have hymned a further and unforeseen transfor- mation: it is like saying that the message would have been the heartbeat of magic. (456) Tom now turns his back upon the vast store of material goods which he has thus acquired by defeating Collins and lives a life of monkish poverty as an obscure but incredibly devoted and talented magician working unknown night clubs. There is a suggestion that he might be preparing himself for a Second Coming, that these are his forty days and forty nights, but "Straub" doesn't see that. He sees that Tom is, like himself, an artist completely engaged in learning his art and that that is an honorable goal. It is not a sufficient goal, though. This magician, unlike Collins, must work before his audience and this novelist must write for his readers. Therein lies the teaching of the art, the communicating of its possibility and its way to us for our deepening and betterment as human beings, for leading us on the magical path to our own godhood.
