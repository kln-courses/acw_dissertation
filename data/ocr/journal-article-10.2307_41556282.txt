<plain_text><page sequence="1">Triangular Erotics: The Politics of Masculinity, Imperialism and Big-Game Hunting in Rider Haggard's She MADHUDAYA SINHA Animal imagery and anthropomorphic parallels abound in Rider Haggard's fantastic African adventure, She (1887).1 Africa itself is presented to the reader as a landscape inhabited by 'beastly' natives and wild animals galore. Even the novel's overpowering female presence, that of 'She-who-must-be-obeyed' (as Ayesha is known by those natives over whom she rules), is eventually reduced to a simian status. Such a textual focus, fitting comfortably into a more extensive dream of Victorian empire, lent the novel cultural, as well as fictive, power. The animal imagery helped to produce durable models of African identity and otherness which were compatible with current ideas of geography, race and human evolution. As such, the Africa of She may be seen not just as complementary to, but as an integral component of, the cultural apparatus of British imperialism and its mechanisms of propaganda, subordination and control at the fin de si√®cle. At the same time, the subtext of the novel is fraught with many inconsistencies and what Joseph Bristow calls 'fatalistic overtones'.2 In the vast hunting grounds of Africa, Leo and Holly live a life which is the stuff of contemporary boys' fiction. They overcome a tempestuous squall, narrowly escape a 'hot-potted' fate at the hands of native cannibals and eventually defeat the novel's central evil power before returning home intact. Yet these actions seem to arise from the trepidations of masculinity at the turn of the century. In fact, as Michael Roper and John Tosh recognise regarding contemporary ideas of masculinity, the masculinity that underpins this novel is able to define itself only 'in relation to "the other'".3 That 'other' takes various forms, including nature, the body of the African native and, last but by no means least, that of Ayesha. The novel, as this article aims to prove, is a fertile ground for all these various discourses.

Descriptions of the natural world and the physical landscape of Africa appear repeatedly in this novel. As John Mackenzie demonstrates in his exhaustive work, The Empire of Nature (1988), this is not at all surprising.4 The earlier Romantics placed the natural world on a pedestal, and killing animals was largely frowned upon. Reading Keith Thomas's work on man's relationship to the natural world during the eighteenth century (1983), Mackenzie points out that meat-eating became suspect and animal welfare a matter of prime concern. It was in this atmosphere that the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was founded in 1824.5 But the movement from these more peaceful ideas to those of hunting and violence was not as abrupt as it might appear. Critiquing Thomas, Mackenzie reminds us that Gothic horror, which was 'one of the manifestations of Romanticism', had a thread of violence, cruelty and 'raw nature' woven into its fabric.6 As the nineteenth century progressed, both these cultural manifestations (nature as an idolised entity and nature as a wild, cruel body needing to be tamed) combined with the already well-established scientific discourses of the natural world and the need to establish dominance over unexplored, hostile colonial terrain. In the years following the Romantic era, the natural historian's efforts to order and classify the world of nature became an integral part of the imperial project. Hunting in the corners of the vast empire 'became a ritualised . . . display of white dominance' and a subject of scholarly examination.7 As mentioned earlier, these spectacular and often violent exploits found their way into a number of popular juvenile fictional accounts of the day. Holly, the protagonist who relates the story, constantly offers descriptions of the landscape (including extensive details of the flora and fauna) and inhabitants of his imagined/real Africa. Even the supernatural thread is expressed in scientific terms. Later on in the story, Ayesha, the seemingly ageless woman, professes to be a scientist with no ties to the supernatural world. In her various encounters with Holly, Ayesha proves to be knowledgeable about a bewildering mix of ideas garnered from a range of far-reaching subjects, including chemistry, astronomy and philosophy. In one instance, when she reveals scenes in a font of water, Holly reacts with shock. Ayesha confidently reassures him: 'Nay, nay; oh Holly, it is no magic; that is a fiction of ignorance. There is no such thing</page><page sequence="3">Triangular Erotics: Masculinity, Imperialism and Hunting in Haggard s She 3 1 as magic' (151). Her scientific materialism supersedes Holly's fear of the supernatural. Later, when the superstitious Job is predictably horrified by seeing images of his long-scattered family in the water's surface, Holly also comes to dismiss it as a mere 'instance of glorified and perfected telepathy' (196).8 Power and control over these distant lands is also established through the hunting of wild animals. As Mackenzie notes, trapping and hunting were integral to the spirit of exploration and adventure which infused the nineteenth century.9 Many contemporary narratives, including those of writers such as G.A. Henty, Captain Mayne Reid and R.M. Ballantyne, revolved around manly virtues like physical courage, endurance, the ability to survive in hostile terrains, a capacity for violence and an impulse to explore new lands. Writers like Baden-Powell upheld the stalwart image of the hunting pioneer as a prototype of ideal masculinity. Quoting from Baden- Powell's Scouting for Boys (1908), Mackenzie writes that the hunter and imperialist shared certain essential qualities: These are frontiersmen of all parts of our Empire [A]ll are peace scouts, real men in every sense of the word, and thoroughly up in scout craft .... They are accustomed to take their lives in their hands, and to fling them down without hesitation if they can help their country by doing so.10 Such a quality of character, which embraced stoicism and the capacity to face triumph and disaster despite all odds, combined with that of the archetypal hunter, is an important part of Rider Haggard's She. It is thus possible to read the novel as a series of hunting adventures strung together and working as a subplot. These offer opportunities for descriptions of the natural environment and of the habits of wild animals, and a series of tests and trials of knowledge, skill and courage through which the protagonists, Holly in particular, become imperial masculine figures. It is worth looking closely at some of the impossibly skilled feats Holly and Leo perform. After surviving the squall, Holly and Leo, along with Job and Muhammad, a 'stout swarthy Arab' who steers their boat and then accompanies them on their overland expedition, begin their long trek to the mountain head (48). During the journey, Holly describes their various encounters with crocodiles and waterfowl, among other exotic creatures. As the journey progresses, the little group espy a 'beautiful water-buck' (65). Here the reader is offered three different sets of descriptions. Firstly, Holly informs us</page><page sequence="4">32 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 3 that the buck had 'great horns curving forward' (65). Next, he writes that Leo (and presumably himself) was 'thirsting for the blood of big game' (65). Finally, he presents a sweeping description of the majesty of the scene, of the 'desolate' and 'fascinating' picture the buck cuts etched against a fiery 'sinking' sun (66). The buck's solitude is repeatedly emphasised by a long description of the empty, primitive landscape stretching away as far as the eye could see. Holly ends this rather Romantic description of the buck (before describing the kill) and the surrounding landscape by noting that they, the three 'modern Englishmen', appear to jar with that 'measureless desolation' (66). While these descriptions do bespeak a traveller's fascination with the exotic, they also reveal a masculine imperative to establish control over 'wild' Africa. A rather complex relationship can be traced between earlier, more peaceful, Romantic preoccupations with nature and the rather violent desire to disrupt that nature towards which Holly's description clearly gravitates. Nowhere is this change more clearly revealed than in the paintings of the mid-Victorian artist Sir Edwin Landseer. Landseer's paintings clearly, in one sense, look back to the Romantic partiality for subjects dealing with nature and landscape. However, the wild beauty of his rolling hills and highlands is subservient to what Mackenzie describes as 'a passion for the chase and the search for anatomical accuracy'.11 Mackenzie notes that the stag and lion were Landseer's great passions. The stag in particular appears to have had a strong hold over the artist. Many of his paintings (including the famous The Monarch of the Glen (1851) and The Hunted Stag (1832)) reflect this fascination with the beauty and the glory behind the hunting prowess which humbles such a Romantic ideal. As Mackenzie notes, Landseer himself was unable to call the killing of a stag anything other than an 'assassination'.12 When Holly offers the reader a description of the magnificent animal before the final act, he sets the stage for a grand kill. As he continues, he offers a violent description of the landscape in contrast to the sentimentalised picture of the buck. On one side lies a 'death breeding swamp' and the whole scene seems to be bathed in the dying light of the setting sun, described as a 'lurid stain of blood' (66). Like a natural historian, Holly gives us minute details of the landscape. But it is left to him, the white, 'modern', imperial hunter, to ponder on the primitive sublimity of that landscape, and, at the same time, to understand that the role of humbling that primitiveness is assigned to</page><page sequence="5">Triangular Erotics: Masculinity, Imperialism and Hunting in Haggard s She 33 the Englishman. In other words, it is the hunter who seems to be capable of traversing these two disparate and polarised spheres, the primitive and the civilised, while playing the role of both surveyor and interpreter. Shortly after this grand encounter with the 'noble buck' the party is visited by a pair of lions (66). These 'hungry beasts' seem to be close enough for Holly to 'catch the glare of their ferocious eyes' (68). While the female is killed almost instantly by Leo, the male meets a rather gory fate. As the lion emerges from the water bank a crocodile latches onto the beast's hind leg and the two fight a 'duel to the death' (69). The descriptions offered in this part of the narrative step beyond the discourse of the natural scientist and tip over into a graphic enjoyment of the violence of Mother Nature. However, the presence of admiring references to nature, like the crocodile's 'soft throat' and the lion's 'great hind claws', do not reduce the horror revealed in this extremely violent battle (69). Mackenzie points out that Landseer's paintings frequently revealed an obsession with 'the majesty and the cruel potential of the national and imperial icon, the lion'. In paintings like The Cat's Paw (1824) and Last Run of the Season (1 85 1), he 'heightened existing violence and even added it where none existed'. Furthermore, his art does not appear to condemn the excessive cruelty portrayed in these much- loved and widely sold pieces. Instead 'human involvement is glorified as an imperative command over nature'.13 Like the Roman gladiators of yesteryear, Holly and his compatriots follow the 'extraordinary scene' and clamour for a 'clear view' (69). Civilisation is brought face-to-face with Mother Nature in all her untamed glory and it is the hunter who can, like a latter-day journalist, gaze upon and provide the one and only true picture of such a battle. The male protagonists in the novel establish control over the natural landscape by both appropriating knowledge and hunting down the wild 'essence', thus taming and humbling the vast African landscape. Nowhere is the masculine imperial presence more clearly present than when Holly is stalking and chasing the beasts of Africa. But the novel offers another interesting twist to this same subplot. One cannot forget that the two chief male protagonists of the novel, Leo and Holly, have come to Africa to hunt for the truth behind a legend surrounding the presence of a powerful and beautiful woman ruling the 'dark continent'. As such, connections, some explicit,</page><page sequence="6">34 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 3 some implicit, can be made with this larger 'hunt' framing the novel and sexuality. The sexual element in the act of hunting has long been recognised by scholars. Hunting diaries of the late nineteenth century contain many accounts describing 'the physical agonies of the Hunt, of the exaltation no civilised world can supply, the tensions induced by great risk, and the ecstasy of release when the hunter prevails and stands over his kill'.14 As such, the whole journey, the quest which lies at the heart of the plot, can be seen as a hunt which culminates in the complete physical submission of 'She-who-must- be-obeyed'. Moreover, trophies themselves were sexual emblems, representing the war between males for sexual conquest. One cannot but help notice that after the death of Ayesha, both Leo and Holly draw a 'shining lock' of her hair as a 'sole memento' (298). With this trophy in hand the duo return home to England. This straightforward 'trail of glory' narrative is, however, marred by certain inconsistencies. On the one hand, Holly is endowed with simian characteristics. As Daniel Karlin reminds us, we cannot forget that Holly is constantly compared to a monkey, an unmistakeable 'Darwinian connotation'.15 Holly's stunted and hairy body and countenance 'reminded me forcibly of a gorilla' says the story's fictional 'Editor' (2). Later on in the novel, Billali repeatedly addresses Holly as 'the baboon', the only saving grace being that this 'baboon' has been gifted with a superior intellect. On the other hand, Leo, Holly's charge and the novel's other male 'hunter', is as handsome as Adonis and 'brilliant and keen-witted, but not a scholar' (21). Leo spends most of his adult life in an all-male world. The remote possibility of a motherly touch is removed when Holly, misogynistically, replaces the young Leo's female custodian with Job. In fact, he makes it clear that he would have 'no woman to lord it over me about the child, and steal his affections from me' (19). As Karlin rightly suggests, in the face of such an extreme antipathy towards womankind it seems illogical to assume that Holly himself would want to go to the far corners of the earth in order to hunt for an unknown woman.16 The question which then arises is who hunts whom? Is this a hunt for Ayesha or does the plot narrate a hunt for Leo by the two hunters, Holly and Ayesha? If so, why would Leo be the target of both a man's and a woman's desires? Perhaps the answer to these questions lies in a further response to the internal crises, particularly sexual ones, of domestic Britain, covertly expressed in Haggard's She.</page><page sequence="7">Triangular Erotics: Masculinity, Imperialism and Hunting in Haggard s She 35 Victorian England was a male-dominated society. All-male institutions, like the public school, the university and the club, and even the topography of the city, offered social contact for men with other men (especially for those of the middle and upper-middle classes). Although marriage itself was still idealised, the act of marriage was more often than not put off for economic and social reasons. Male love and close bonds between men 'came to be seen as finer, nobler and more fulfilling' than the traditional heterosexual relationship. The bachelordom created by social and economic factors led to an enthusiastic participation in 'male comradeship and male love'.17 As the century progressed, such manly love became closely interwoven with the world of public-school education. Furthermore, as Jeffrey Richards notes, these emotional friendships carried on into university life as well. Richards thus points out that, at Oxford, for example, 'the Tractarians were notable for intense friendships, some of them probably sublimated homosexuality, and others part of the extravagant emotionalism of the age'.18 It is against this background that we can see the importance of the relationship Leo and Holly share in the world of Cambridge. Although, towards the end of the century, the earlier Tractarian culture of male bonding was still an integral part of society, concern about sexual relations between men had mounted. The Labouchere amendment to the Criminal Law of 1885 outlawed such connections. In fact, this amendment outlawed sexual activities between men (acts of 'gross indecency'), even in private. Labouchere 's notorious clause (later known as the 'blackmailer's charter') was a defining feature of new perceptions about sexual desire and sexual morality.19 There is no explicitly homosexual content in Haggard's She. But the heterosexual content is suspect since women are either given a miniscule role and removed from the plot entirely (as is the hapless Ustane, who falls prey to Ayesha) or, despite being granted power (as Ayesha is), eventually vanquished leaving no room for a long- lost hero to reunite with a heroine. Writing about Robert Louis Stevenson, Wayne Koestenbaum uses Haggard's narratives as a comparison to those of Stevenson. He comments that 'Haggard's romances make room for pederasty by excluding marriage'.20 Certainly, Haggard takes great pains to banish women from the early part of She. Yet, try as he might to keep women away from the boy in his charge, Holly leads his young ward on an expedition towards a final confrontation with 'She', the ultimate in feminine 'evil'. In</page><page sequence="8">36 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 3 this manner, the novel reads like an initiation into manhood, in which the inability to resist sexual temptation stands as the greatest sign of weakness in men. The plot then weaves around Holly who clearly shares a somewhat intense idealised relationship with Leo. He informs us that young Leo is the 'handsomest fellow I have ever seen' and resembles a 'Greek God' (109). Believing that the 'boy was old enough to do without female assistance', Holly arranges for 'a suitable male attendant' to look after Leo (19). The first sentence Leo utters to his guardian seals the homoerotic bond against which Ayesha's sexually consuming energies later prove to be powerless: 'I like you . . . you is ugly, but you is good' (20). As Holly goes on to say, 'Few sons have been loved as I love Leo' (20). Love between these men far surpasses that which Ayesha shows for Kallikrates, her lover from centuries gone by, and whom Leo resembles. Such a love as Holly and Leo bear for each other is also highly idealised. Certainly Leo is made out to be marvellously handsome and agile. But at key moments in the plot, when the travelling group comes close to death, Leo is almost always absent. His physical presence is eliminated, since for much of the narrative Leo lies in an exhausted 'profound sleep' (36) or, worse still, twitching in the 'death-throes' of a malarial attack (198). Furthermore, as Karlin comments, not only is Leo excluded from an active role in the narration, Holly seems to control the narrative.21 Thus, although Leo is physically a virtual embodiment of a beautiful Greek god, his intellectual attributes seem to fall far short of one. The relationship between an older, wiser man and a beautiful youth is a common trope in accounts of male friendships. Such a trope can be traced back to classical Greek history and mythology. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, reading K.J. Dover's study, Greek Homosexuality (1978), describes pederastie relationships in classical Greece. Young boys were often pursued by older men, and these relationships were frequently described using romantic terminology. Such a love had a 'strongly educational function' for the younger partner, while at the same time assigning him a relatively inferior and 'oppressive' role.22 Using this framework, one can conclude that Holly is Leo's older 'lover-mentor'. It is in this light that we can now turn to the entrance of Ayesha on the scene. Sedgwick explains that a pattern of 'homosocial desire' cannot be understood 'outside of its relation to women'.23 Using Ren√© Girard's</page><page sequence="9">Triangular Erotics : Masculinity, Imperialism and Hunting in Haggard s She 37 concept of the 'erotic triangle', Sedgwick explains that, 'in any erotic rivalry, the bond that links the two rivals is as intense ... as the bond that links either of the rivals to the beloved'. In fact, she goes on to say that, in the triangle proposed by Girard, the relationship between the rivals is stronger than that between the rivals and the beloved. Her argument with this theory is that the participants in the triangle have no subjectivity and as such are rendered ahistorical. The 'asymmetries' of power contained in such triangles in turn contain other imbalances which are ignored in the Girardian analysis. These 'hidden obliquities' reveal more than the body of sexuality: they open texts out to resistances displayed within that triangle.24 Haggard's imperial romance is built around such a triangle - Holly professes to be in love with Ayesha, who in turn loves Leo, who in his turn loves Ayesha. The relationship between these three characters, with its strong (pre-existing) bond between the male rivals, conforms closely to the Girardian model. But as Sedgwick so importantly observes, there are power imbalances here that need to be looked at closely. At one point in the narrative Holly is deeply enamoured with Ayesha and finds himself drawn to her by 'some magnetic force' (156). And, as the story continues, Leo also has little choice as he is swept away by 'the power of her dread beauty' (229). In this highly melodramatic love triangle, the tussle for one woman by two men is interlaced, as we shall see, with other nuanced issues of control. As discussed earlier, Holly's relationship with Leo is tinged with a flavour of classical Greek homoeroticism. The ugly Holly constantly draws attention to Leo's magnificent figure. Although he is 'not a scholar', his 'golden locks' are extolled repeatedly (21). If Holly is the 'Beast' with the 'mark of Cain' stamped on him, Leo is the beauty admired by one and all (21). At the outset, Holly does not appear to want to launch himself on an expedition in search of a 'white sorceress living in the heart of an African swamp' (46). But Leo is determined to undertake the journey. Holly decides to go along, loth to let his ward far from his sight, admitting that 'I was far too much attached to him for that' (46). And so the two male protagonists depart on their hunt for the beautiful 'remote ancestress' (45). After a number of impossibly fantastic adventures, the duo find Ayesha or 'She-who-must-be-obeyed'. Leo is unconscious and on the brink of death. As Holly waits for this elusive woman to reveal</page><page sequence="10">38 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 3 herself, he wonders what lies behind the heavy curtains that hide the mysterious Ayesha: 'some naked savage queen, a languishing Oriental beauty, or a nineteenth-century young lady, drinking afternoon tea?' (141). Deirdre David focuses on these three stereotypical images and finds that they form the parameters of Holly's 'misogynistic imagination'. As David notes, in such an imagination, 'women are either lustful savages, pliable exotic creatures, or guardians of social manners'.25 However, the reality behind the curtains screening Ayesha is very different. Ayesha is a 'great chemist' with her very own cave-turned-laboratory, a clairvoyant who can produce an image of what is 'actually in the mind of someone present' upon the surface of a pool of water, and an intellectual, eager to engage in lengthy debates on a wide range of subjects, including religion, philosophy and metaphysics (151). The unveiled Ayesha suggests that she is no erotic fancy but, in fact, albeit from a male narrator's perspective, all that Holly and Leo are, and more. The natural scientist and historian in Holly find their match in this ageless woman. Many critics, including Nina Auerbach, have interpreted the fear Holly frequently expresses of Ayesha as the prevailing cultural fear of the New Woman. In Woman and the Demon (1982), Auerbach describes Ayesha as a 'galvanised and transfigured Victoria' for whom 'love does not tranquilise womanhood into domestic confinement'.26 In her analysis of She, Deirdre David notes that the Kingdom of Kor itself appears to be economically nonproductive. Its inhabitants do not seem to carry out any labour, manual or otherwise, for Ayesha, 'beyond prostrating themselves at her feet'.27 Time stands still for these denizens of the African wilderness. The Amahaggers live in conditions which are, in Holly's words, 'primitive to the extreme' (89). The land they inhabit shows no sign of fertility, surrounded as it is by marshy land and dry volcanic plains. To make matters worse, their habitat is described as a 'great morass' reeking with the smell of rotting vegetation (89). David describes this as an empire of the self-sufficient female body.28 Hunting and imperialism went hand in hand because both projects shared a belief: that wild lands, capable of being tamed and rendered economically productive, must be allowed to remain so, even at the cost of violent confrontations. Billali and his entourage of natives sullenly acknowledge Holly's supreme skills when he shoots an eland with ease and mastery. Billali even asks the white man if he could</page><page sequence="11">Triangular Erotics: Masculinity, Imperialism and Hunting in Haggard's She 39 teach him to 'slay in this fashion' (128). In his novel, Haggard expresses the then-dominant cultural ideas of hunting and imperialism. These beliefs were widespread and filtered down to various all-male organisations. By the end of the nineteenth century a number of organisations existed to 'protect, encourage, or celebrate the killing of wildlife for sport'.29 Mangan and Mackenzie provide an interesting example of one such organisation, the Shikar Club. This club displayed an extraordinarily aggressive attitude towards the 'utilitarian killing of wildlife by natives', claiming that their hunting skills lacked the 'training and testing' required to become strong, masculine hunters. The club members also believed that such a utilitarian variety of hunting subjected the native to the vagaries of a dominant Mother Nature. In the Shikar Club's ideology, the native had neither the physical nor the moral strength (which, in turn, were markers of manhood) to conquer the dangers posed by his habitat. Thus, a flawed version of native manhood was contrasted with the European version. European men had 'mastered the physical environment and its inherent dangers - an achievement based on scientific rationality'.30 Ayesha's empire, however, is peopled by 'feeble' natives. The woman who rules this empire appears to be timeless but infertile. Her subjects, unlike Britain's stalwart citizens, labour aimlessly to produce no economic advantages either for themselves or the empire. The only animal they seem to be eating (and therefore killing) is the goat. The endless narcissistic power to terrorise is all that Ayesha holds and must be destroyed. Mangan and Mackenzie emphasise the fact that for organisations like the Shikar Club, the 'virility' of imperial big-game hunting was 'increasingly contrasted with the emasculated sport' of fox-hunting. In the view of radical conservatives, the sport of fox-hunting suffered from the debilitating presence of women.31 As early as the 1850s, women were asserting a position of equality in the fox-hunting field. Once women were able to ride cross-saddle, they were able to prove their equestrian skills.32 As more women began taking an active part in this hitherto masculine sport, conservatives such as the Shikar Club members felt that the sport itself suffered.33 In the same manner we can see that the ineffectual subsistence hunting of the Amahaggers is equated to a feminised and thus ineffective activity. As a huntress, Ayesha has been waiting for Kallikrates to reincarnate for 'two thousand generations' (165). If Leo is pictured along classical mythology lines, Ayesha can also be pictured as a</page><page sequence="12">40 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 3 deity of the hunt, Artemis or Diana. In Woman the Hunter, Mary Zeiss Stange associates both Diana and Artemis with 'gender- bending'.34 Both Diana and Artemis represent a power - female power - that can be perceived as highly problematic for a patriarchal society. The goddess of the hunt is a virgin goddess who is "'one-in- herself' and not the consort or property of any man (or god)'.35 Stange interprets such resolute virginity to symbolise the rejection of socially constructed norms of conventional femininity. But this very virginity renders her vulnerable, since to be virginal refers to a space which bears no reference without the male figure. Stange further points out that both Artemis and Diana are simultaneously moon goddesses, at once 'enticing, romantic, and remote'.36 Artemis is, most importantly, the goddess of the outdoor world, or the world beyond the city. She is thus all Woman and therefore the one to be hunted down. However, she also embodies a primitive huntress quality, trapping and killing those in her path. It is this femme fatale quality that is identified by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar as the source of the astonishing hold of She over the late- Victorian imagination. In their extensive study, Gilbert and Gubar point out that the image of the femme fatale graced the walls of many art galleries and filled out the lines of a host of woman-hating poems.37 Such a likeness of Ayesha is an 'anti- Victoria' image, one which would, according to Holly, 'assume absolute rule over the British dominions' (178). Moreover, emerging suffragist and native demands for independence created a link between the forms of resistance voiced by both groups.38 Female authority and female vulnerability, in the shape of Ayesha as the Goddess of Hunting, then shape the contours of this particular version of empire. In the final chapters, Ayesha, wishing to be (re)united with Leo (whom she believes to be the reincarnation of Kallikrates), takes Holly and Leo on a long and arduous journey into the heart of a mountain. Here she leads them to the 'Fountain and Heart of Life' (287), which will 'wash' Leo and unite him with her (288). But, as fate would have it, Ayesha enters the flames only to age like a 'withered parchment' (293) and shrinks into a 'baboon' with 'a million wrinkles' (294). The final reduction of Ayesha to a monkey puts the dreadful power of woman's physical attraction in its proper place. After picking their trophy, a lock of her hair, Holly and Leo escape from 'the very womb of the Earth, wherein she doth conceive the Life that ye see brought forth in men and beast' (197). They had</page><page sequence="13">Triangular Erotics: Masculinity, Imperialism and Hunting in Haggard s She 4 1 originally entered her home through 'the mouth of a dark tunnel' (129). Once they escape, Holly and Leo return to their all-male Oxford digs, where Holly completes his manuscript 'with Leo leaning over my shoulder in my old room in my college' (316). Saved from emasculating female power, Leo recalls that when Ayesha stretched out her hand to him 'he felt as though he had suddenly received a violent blow in the chest, and, what is more, utterly cowed, as if all manhood had been taken out of him' (302). While woman might be the source of life, the evolution of society and politics is a narrative of civilisation and patriarchy. Thus, Ayesha is the negative image of Queen Victoria, an uncivilised sovereign: her entry into England would be at a 'terrible sacrifice of life'; for her 'proud, ambitious spirit would be certain to break loose and avenge itself' (255). Thus, only the two men return across the 'horrible gulf' (316) of the abyss which separates the interiors of Africa from the civilisation of the outside world. The body of the ancient queen remains behind in the cave. Drawing an association between the male hunter and a 'complementary feminine' presence, Ruth Weidner writes that such a presence is common in classical and modern metaphor and mythology.39 She also notes the relationship the hunter forms with the hunted, a relationship that is 'consummated with the kill'.40 If Ayesha is seen as the hunted creature, Holly certainly does form a relationship with her. Despite his misogynistic impulses, he is trapped in the 'web of her fatal fascinations' (178). But the role of the masculine hunter does not end here. Through the act of hunting, the male affirms his own masculine identity. As suitor or husband he brings back game and trophies as 'proof and emblem of masculine prowess'.41 If leaving home for the wilds establishes masculinity, the circle is complete when the successful hunter returns to the 'domestic sphere with a bag of game'. It is at the moment of return that the archetypal gender duality between the male prowess of the hunters and the domestic sphere of the waiting females is most accentuated. Thus it is that myth and history emphasise the concept of winning women by killing game.42 Ayesha then becomes a symbolic mediator in the starting, or the restarting, of the relationship between Holly and Leo. Once Ayesha has '[fallen] down and died' (294), Holly and Leo attempt their long and perilous return from the mountain. In the face of danger, the two men return to an easy, 'clubbing' camaraderie, with Leo slipping into the</page><page sequence="14">42 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 3 familiar 'old fellow' mode (297).43 Holly admits that he 'did a thing' he had not 'done since Leo was a little boy' (304). Stating that this was a man he 'could not have loved more', Holly puts his arm around Leo and kisses him on the forehead (304). The hunter has finally returned to where he belongs. In the late nineteenth century, the act and sport of hunting was simultaneously a mark of the fitness of the dominant race, an emblem of imperial rule and an allegory of human, particularly sexual, affairs. In Rider Haggard's She these markers are interwoven into a complex fabric to reveal both radically conservative and homosocial versions of manhood. The 'continuum'44 between the two versions is almost always absent, at best oddly out of place when it appears. Both versions of manhood appear to be resistant to the existing social structure and this is nowhere more clearly revealed than through the body of the animal and feminine 'other'. Notes 1 .
