LEGRAND United States Geological Survey, Washington, D.C. ABSTRACT Differences in concepts of many geomorphic processes are attributed in part to the widespread use of metaphor, which encourages superficial perception and faulty interpretations. Some terms, such as "slope retreat," seem to animate the landscape and to muddle our inferences. By recognizing the expediency of metaphor and its indelible place in our language and by trying to discipline our thoughts, we might escape the illusion that we adequately understand geomorphic processes. The appeal of brief, vivid, and perhaps scape by the skilful use of metaphor.

Some 576</page><page sequence="2">GEOLOGICAL NOTES measure of restraint has been imposed on its use in scientific language-but apparent- ly to a lesser degree of geomorphology than in other branches of geology. It is the pur- pose of this short article to suggest that there is a general unawareness of our ig- norance of some geomorphic processes and that this plight is largely the result of meta- phor in our geologic thoughts and expres- sions. In recent years a few geologists have contended that we know less about geomor- phic processes than we realize. In an ex- ceptionally analytical paper Strahler (1952, p. 924) says that the slowness of contribu- tions from the geologist may cause the engi- neer to find it necessary to take over an increasingly greater proportion of research in geomorphology. He further suggests that our weakness in understanding geomorphic processes is the result of the domination, by W. M. Davis and his students, of an explanatory-descriptive method of study in which process is considered only insofar as needed to "permit an orderly genetic system of landform classification." During a symposium on Walther Penck's contribu- tion to geomorphology, Leighly (1940, p. 225) stated: Davis's great mistake was the assumption that we know the processes involved in the development of land forms. We don't; and until we do we shall be ignorant of the general course of their development. In his eagerness to set up a general system, Davis jumped over the preliminary, necessarily painfully slow study of processes, and so left his system with an inadequate foundation. Also during the same symposium Bryan (1940, p. 254) opened his discussion with the following comments: The impact of the radical doctrines of Wal- ther Penck (1924) on the American school of geomorphology has all the effect of a cold shower on a complaisant reveler. Slightly bemused by long, though mild intoxication on the limpid prose of Davis's remarkable essays, he wakes with a gasp to realize that in considering the important question of slope he has always sub- stituted words for knowledge, phrases for critical observation. He has been lulled into complai- sance by the sonorous expressions: "retreat of slopes," "gradual reduction to a gently undulat- ing plain," "the smooth and gentle slopes of old age." Suddenly faced with a challenge to his long practiced incantations he finds himself unprepared to defend these ritualistic formulae. Thus Bryan approaches the crux of the present thesis-that the mental pictures we have of landscape development are the result of the common use of metaphor and that this in turn has led us to believe that we adequately understand geomorphic proc- esses. The blame for this plight should not necessarily be placed on geomorphologists, who have made many fine contributions, particularly as to the description of land- forms, the stages in their development, and the influences of structure on them. Most geomorphologists understand processes suf- ficiently to pursue their studies objectively, and they believe that intensive studies of processes lie in the branch of dynamic ge- ology. The relative order of importance of (1) process, (2) stage, and (3) structure in the development of landscapes is provisional and is a personal matter depending on one's objective. Geomorphology puts special em- phasis on stage (Schultz, 1955, p. 1207), whereas dynamic geology, to the extent that it exists as a branch of the geosciences, considers process to be the most important variable (Ting, 1942, p. 185). The fact re- mains that the intricate work of natural agencies operating to form landscapes is poorly understood. This not only has a retarding influence on geomorphic studies but is damaging to important economic con- siderations in several fields of geology. Rec- ognition of this weakness should be the first stage in correcting it. It should not be inferred from the pre- vious remarks that Davis is to be blamed for our backwardness in understanding geo- morphic processes. His understanding of processes appears to have been good enough to sustain most of his deductions. However, some of his followers, including the writer, have been misled by the apparently clear but superficial understanding of processes his picture language gave. 577</page><page sequence="3">GEOLOGICAL NOTES Davis was aware that his concepts of geomorphology introduced many metaphor- ical expressions concerning land sculpture. He presumably had learned the benefits of metaphor from Powell, Gilbert, and other early workers, who, years before, had bor- rowed as many existing lay words as possible to express pictorially the landforms and the processes of degradation working on them. Davis pointed out (1909, p. 292) that, to convey certain ideas about land- forms, many ordinary words could be used in a more or less new and special sense. He cited such terms as "cycle," "stage," "interruption," "accident," "consequent," "grade," "revived," and "drowned." In the absence of satisfactory existing words, such new terms as "peneplain," "base-level," "obsequent," and "insequent" were intro- duced. The objections that arose from the introduction of these new terms, as well as others, serve to show the strong public appeal for metaphor. Except for surface bodies of water, the topography around us is made up of passive objects. Yet, in describing the landscape, some geologists attempt to animate the topography and treat the objects as though they were active. They have done this by filling their language with analogies, espe- cially with those that involve human quali- ties. Examples of such anthropomorphic expressions are the assignment of "youth- ful," "mature," and "old age" stages to the geomorphic cycle and such convenient terms as "beheaded river," "elbow of cap- ture," and "foot of a scarp." Although the logician may contend that illogical conclu- sions may result from the use of such picture language in the place of more precise ex- planation, it is difficult to argue against the usefulness of these analogies in geo- morphic descriptions. Nevertheless, words that attempt to animate the topography should be scrutinized for any harmful effects. Since the geomorphologist is concerned more with landforms as the effects of ge- ologic processes than with the details of the processes producing them, he is generally satisfied to reduce to a brief combination of words the processes that are involved. These word combinations are intended to render a process self-explanatory. Such word combinations as "headward erosion," "solu- tion subsidence," "rock creep," "mass wast- ing," "slope retreat," and "backwearing" supposedly portray certain geologic proc- esses without the need of real explanation. Careful analysis of the processes that these combinations of picture words are sup- posed to portray indicates that a geologist may naturally reach conclusions that are not logically justified. The terms "slope retreat" and "back- wearing" are often regarded as processes accounting for the position of a slope rela- tive to "its" former position. They should perhaps be interpreted as the results of separation in space and time of two quasi- parallel or non-parallel slopes. As to im- agery, the terms are poor because of the following reasons: They incorrectly imply that only one slope is involved. As a matter of fact, beginning with some arbitrary initial slope there has been a multiplicity of intermediate slopes ending with a present-day observable slope. Aside from all the intermediate slopes-if picture language must be used, we might consider them stages in the "retreat" of a slope-a pertinent initial slope and its present-day counterpart are two independent slopes and should be so regarded. They incorrectly imply that a slope, rather than being acted upon, is acting. A slope is a passive, inanimate surface of the ground and in a strict sense cannot retreat. Gravity, generally with the help of water, is the acting force responsible for changes of the land surface. They incorrectly imply that degradational agents work in a horizontal rather than in a vertical field. Since gravitational forces control degradation, it is clear that any sound concept of degradational processes must lay stress on lowering of the land surface in a vertical field. A great local variation in degradation-rela- tively slight on the plain above and the plain below a scarp and relatively great on the scarp- leaves the false impression that processes work- ing in a horizontal field have caused the scarp to migrate or retreat. The vivid pictures one apparently gets from the terms "stream piracy" and "solu- tion subsidence" invite superficial under- 578</page><page sequence="4">GEOLOGICAL NOTES standing of the processes involved. Despite the great amount of attention given to the subject of stream piracy, it seems that very little consideration has been given to the significance of space and time as interde- pendent factors resulting in the actual diver- sion of water from one stream to another. Sinkhole topography and development of caverns in limestone areas are often ex- plained as the mere result of solvent action of ground water, giving the impression that further thought on the process is unneces- sary. However, Swinnerton (1932, p. 664) points out: Like many other geological phenomena the origin of caverns has seemed for years an ob- vious matter; it is only on mature reflection that the appearance of superficial simplicity gives way to the impression of baffling com- plexity. Most controversies in scientific study are passing stages in the development of knowl- edge. Two controversies in geomorphology that have been unduly prolonged (perhaps by our acceptance of ideas that we get from picture language) are those dealing with (1) peneplanation versus pedimentation and (2) parallel retreat of slopes versus flattening of slopes. These controversies can soon be resolved for the clear-thinking geologist if all pertinent aspects of hydrology, both on the land surface and beneath it, are evalu- ated objectively. Unfortunately, agreement on these subjects is not likely to be reached soon because metaphor in the literature has muddled the thinking of many geolo- gists. As long as our schools allow, and even encourage, students to substitute picture words for fundamental explanations of ge- ological processes, both dynamic geology and geomorphology will suffer. The use of metaphor encourages super- ficial perception and the consequent faulty interpretation of geological processes; in many cases even the specialist does not realize that metaphor in his thoughts has oversimplified the answers to his problems and muddled his inferences. The geologist's great usefulness comes from his ability to draw all reasonable inferences from available facts and to weigh correctly both the facts and the inferences. His inferences will likely be more correct if he realizes the limitations of specific analogies that he finds useful. Since it is impossible, and perhaps undesir- able, to eliminate metaphor from his ex- pressions, he should try to be aware of it in his thoughts. For a more objective anal- ysis of physical processes the geologist would be wise to consider that the name given to a fact is not identical with that fact; moreover, he should realize that many of our metaphorical expressions are merely primitive perceptions that are only quasi- explanatory. Admittedly, the use of meta- phor by the geologist is expedient, and any attempt to suppress its use might lead to dull and voluminous expression. Neverthe- less, by recognizing the indelible place of metaphor in our language and by trying to discipline our thoughts, we might escape the illusion that we adequately understand geomorphic processes.
