PREHISTORY Paleolithic and Mesolithic THE years 1952-1954 have seen only limited activity in the study of the Paleolithic in the Iberian Peninsula; and this has been confined to isolated instances. Nevertheless, interesting results have been obtained. In the rich Cantabrian zone?apart from cave art which will be treated separately? one must mention the work carried out by the recently created "Servicio de Excava- ciones Arqueol6gicas de la Diputaci6n de Oviedo," under the direction of Francisco Jorda. It is his intention to reinvestigate the numerous caves of the region in which Paleolithic levels have been noted, in order to excavate the intact levels remaining and so recheck the published results which were generally the work of that noted investiga- tor, Conde de la Vega del Sella. At the same time, data have been collected about other caves which had not been noted or where no archeological work had been car? ried out. It is hoped that they can be ex- plored with modern methods; the first cam- paign is to be carried out in the summer of 1955. In 1953, F. Jorda explored Bricia cave near Cueto de la Mina (1954c). With the geologist Professor N. Llopis, he studied the Asturian shell-mound in the cave en? trance, coming to the conclusion that the shell-mound had been formed by alluvium from the river Calabres, which had capped the cave deposits. This modifies the old views on the habitat of Asturian Man. The two Magdalenian levels from the cave, with their many quartzite tools, were classified as Magdalenian VI b and VI a. The construction of the path leading to Castillo and La Pasiega caves, besides being responsible for the discovery of new paint- ings (Las Monedas and Chimenea caves), also led to the discovery of a poorly defined Mousterian industry in La Flecha cave. In Las Monedas cave, in addition to the bed of quartzite tools of a Mousteroid charac- i The division of effort in the preparation of this chapter has been shared by the authors according to their special interests: Professor Pericot prepared the report on "Prehistory," Professor Alcobe* con- tributed the section on "Physical Anthropology," and Professor Caro Baroja wrote on "Ethnology." 501</page><page sequence="2">502 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 ter, there also was found a poor post-Paleo- lithic industry. At the same time, the work of conservation in La Pasiega cave gave rise to the discovery of some rich stratified layers, one of which contains an assemblage of Mousteroid pieces, with choppers made on quartzite pebbles and quartzite points. The upper and final Solutrean level was well-defined with laurel points and others of willow leaf, hollow base, and shouldered types; also fluted gravers, a painted sand- stone spatula, and an incised horn awl. The Magdalenian bed also was very rich, with many flint and horn tools (points with cir- cular, quadrangular, and triangular sec? tions, one of which has a basal perforation; bevelled points); a small cylindrical rod bore engravings which were difficult to in- terpret. This belongs (Anonymous, 1953; Carballo, 1952, 1953) to the Early Mag? dalenian of the Cantabrians (Magdalenian III of Breuil's system). In Pendo cave (Escobedo-Camargo, San- tander), the excavations were renewed in 1953, under the direction of Messrs. Marti- nez Santa-Olalla, Ruiz Argites, and Chey- nier. They found a clear stratified deposit of much interest for the study of the proto- Magdalenian. Previously unpublished finds from the cave now were made known, pro? viding rich material from various stages, especially the Magdalenian VI, the Magda- lenian-Azilian transition period. An Astu- rian shell-mound contained bones engraved with fish and horse. A Solutrian industry yielded a baton-de-commandement, sup- posed to represent a woman. In a trial dig, lower Paleolithic deposits were found, with Acheulian industry and Levallois pieces (Carbollo and Gonzalez, 1952). In Catalonia, work in the important cave of Reclau Viver (Serina, Gerona) by J. M. Corominas was continued to 1952. Coro- minas also explored other Paleolithic de? posits. The 1954 find of part of a skele- ton, imbedded in the tufa of Banolas lake, excited much interest in scientific circles. Unfortunately, the skeleton was badly treated by the workmen who found it, but the circumstances in which it was found suggest that it was of Mesolithic age, be? cause, nearby, there was a trapezoidal flint, and an upper bed contained other remains with pottery (Pericot et al., 1952). The finds made by Salvador Vilaseca in the province of Tarragona were of great in? terest (1952c). They show, among other things, a Mousterio-Levallois industry in Reus and an Epigravettian industry near the Tivissa cave paintings. The "Seminario de Historia Primitiva del Hombre" of Madrid University con? tinued working on the classic site of Man- zanares under the difficulties to be expected for a site next to a rapidly expanding city. Although the sandpits on which Obermaier and Perez de Barradas based their system have disappeared, new deposits have been opened nearby. The results from the work of recent years have not yet been published. It is to be hoped that during the prepara? tion for the 1957 INQUA Congress it will be possible to clarify a matter of such tran- scendental importance. Occasional notes in the newspapers indicated that at Manza- nares, as in the Jarama terraces, various Paleolithic industries and their associated faunas, including elephant remains, were found. The most intense and methodical field work on the Paleolithic during the period under review was that undertaken by the "Servicio de Investigaci6n Prehist6rica de la Diputaci6n de Valencia" in the caves to the south of the province of Valencia. The investigations carried out in the district of Rotova were under the direction of Pericot, while Jorda directed the excavations in Cova Negra (Jativa). In addition, Professors S. AlcoW, D. Fletcher (1952b, 1953, 1954), E. Pla, and J. Alcacer, gave their help. In the 1954 campaign, Miss Beatrice Blance from Edinburgh University took part. In 1951, after the excavation of the Rates Penaes cave (with Solutrian beds), the cave of Barranc Blanc was discovered, only a few kilometers to the south of the famous cave of Parpall6. The cave showed human remains and a clearly defined stra? tigraphy. In 1952, only work of an explora- tory nature was carried out in the district. In 1953 and 1954, thanks to the help given by the Wenner-Gren Foundation it was pos? sible to excavate, almost completely, the</page><page sequence="3">Spain and Portugal?Pericot, Alcobi, and Baroja 503 cave of Barranc Blanc. The stratigraphy was very clear, and at this writing, the excava? tion report is in preparation for publica? tion. Briefly, the stratigraphy showed three levels, without separation by sterile layers. The earliest can be attributed to the upper Gravettian; the middle layer is Solutrean, and the upper is Epigravettian. Here is represented the Epigravettian of Pericot's system in its purest form, similar to the cor- responding level in the Mallaetes cave. In 1954 a curious industry of macroscrapers and discs made from hard limestone and quartzite appeared and was reminiscent of the finds from Cocina cave (Dos Aguas). Many caves in the Gandia region remain to be investigated and great results can be hoped for. Thanks to aid from the Wenner-Gren Foundation, it was possible to undertake an intensive campaign of excavation on the important site of Cova Negra (Jativa), in 1953, under the direction of F. Jorda and D. Fletcher. Jorda presented (1953) the fol? lowing stratigraphical sequence of the six levels observed in the most complete por- tion of the cave: a) final evolved Levallois- Mousterian with typical Aurignacian and pre-Aterian or Aterian pieces; b) Levallois- Mousterian; c) Mousterian in the Acheu- lean tradition, with small pieces, triangular points, Levallois flakes, bifacial quartzite hand-axes of final Acheulean types; d) sterile; e) Early Mousterian with side scrapers and triangular points worked in the Clactonian technique; f) Moustero- Tayacian with small Mousterian types and pieces worked in the Clactonian technique. The tendency towards the Tayacian tech? nique was interesting and already has been commented upon by Breuil. A parallel to the persistence of Mousterian traditions in the Aurignacian can be seen in other Span? ish sites (Conde cave, Tun6n, Asturias). The Alcoy region continued to be one of the most important in Spain for prehis? toric finds. Various open-air sites which produced Paleolithic-looking flints may have been workshops. Brotons excavated a cave in Mariola mountain containing a clear Mousterian industry with affinities to the Mousterian of Cova Negra (Jativa) with its Tayacian influence. In 1953 and 1954, Paleolithic-looking flints were found (Ramos, 1953) in the terraces of the Vinalop6 river near Elche (Alicante). In Portugal, no new important Paleo? lithic discoveries were published in 1952- 1954. The rich Solutrean material from Rio Maior and other sites remained unpub- lished. On the other hand, geologically badly defined quartzite tools, in the north? ern coastal regions, were becoming increas? ingly common. Apart from the classic Asturian industry, another quartzite indus? try, which showed signs of being much earlier, was appearing from material pre? sented by Professor Castro Nunez to the Archeological Museum of Barcelona. Viana and Zbyszewski (1952) made known their earlier finds in the Beja neigh? borhood. These came from twenty-nine surface sites forming a dense nucleus on the 250-meters plateau. Both authors con? sidered the sites to be grouped in the following five series: a) Abbevillian, quartz tools much rolled and heavily patinated. b) and c) Early and Middle Acheulean, with an Eolithic patina. d) Mousterian or Mousterian with Tayacian facies. e) Lan- guedocian. f) Post-Paleolithic. All the im- plements (483) and sites were classified according to this series, and the results of a statistical analysis of the series and types, morphology, special techniques, and typol- ogy of utilized pieces, were presented in tabular form. The Mousterian technique predominated in the quartzite (369), jasper (56), and quartz (45) implements, and there were only 8 pieces of flint. Costa Arthur made known the results of her investigation in Setubal (1953), where she studied a series of Paleolithic and Meso- lithic sites. From the point of view of Mesolithic chronology, the excavation of the shell- mounds at Muge has been always very im? portant. The earliest, "Cabe$o d'Amoreira," is 12 meters higher than "Cabe$o d'Ar- ruda," which would appear to suggest a higher sea level. There were no shells of Mytilus edulis in the first; instead there was</page><page sequence="4">504 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 Natica hebrea, indicating that the sea was warmer than at the present day. Triangles predominate in the industry which has an almost complete lack of trapezoids, while a Paleolithic tradition is present. Thus it is an early Mesolithic site, approximating in time to the early Sauveterrian and Tar- denoisian cultures of southwest France. On the other hand, the excavations in the "Moita de Sebastiao" shell-mound, showed that, there, triangles were rare and trape? zoids were the most common tool; this was a more evolved industry of Tardenoisian type. Carefully constructed hut foundations and pits for the storage of shell-fish were also uncovered (Roche, 1952). The controversy over the relations be? tween North Africa and Spain during the Paleolithic continued to be very lively and many publications appeared discussing the problem. Professor Balout of the Algiers Museum held a negative view, and Profes? sor Pericot held the affirmative one. Cabot Briggs (1953, in litteris) reviewed the situ? ation and considered that there were no decisive factors for or against either side. Balout and Pericot (1953a) had occasion to present their respective points of view in the congresses at Algiers and Tetuan. A group of students attempted (Septem? ber 1954) to prove that even with primi? tive means it would have been possible to cross the Strait of Gibraltar. The attempt was abandoned, though for reasons not af- fecting the tenability of the hypothesis under discussion. F. Jorda continued the study of the Solu? trean and was awarded a doctorate from Madrid University for his thesis on this theme. He accepts Gisela Freund's views and rejects the hypothesis of an origin in the African Aterian for the Spanish Solu? trean, for which he accepts the persistence of Mousterian tradition. The Spanish Pro- tosolutrean is more limited and later than the French. In November 1954, Jorda ex- plored some sites in the northern Spanish Sahara. Pericot, in a review (1954) of the Spanish Paleolithic, retained his already known opinions, while admitting the possibility of a Euro-Asiatic Solutrean which recent work seemed to point to. (See also Jorda, 1954b.) Cave Art Discussions on cave art at many con? gresses and visits from Spanish and foreign experts in recent years have stimulated in? terest leading to new discoveries and fur? ther study. All this has added to the con? troversy over the chronology and the rela? tions between Eastern and Cantabrian art. Since the stratigraphical proof of the exten- sive development of Solutrean art at Par- pall6, bringing almost general acceptance of a post-Paleolithic age for the nucleus of Eastern art, a truly great step forward has been taken in the study of prehistoric Spanish art. The question was summarized in two pamphlets from the IV International Con? gress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sci? ences, celebrated in Madrid in April 1954; one by Jorda on "El arte rupestre canta- brico" (1954; see also Castillo, 1954a); and the other by Almagro on "Las pinturas rupestres levantinas" (1954b). Jordd be- lieved that the Epigravettian peoples did not produce works of art, and that with them and the final Magdalenians there dis- appeared the creators of the great Can- tabro-Aquitanian art. In the Cantabrian caves are paintings which ought to be at? tributed to the Solutreans, as should one of the phases of the paintings of La Pileta. Today it is difficult to justify the evolu? tionary scheme as set forth by Breuil. Professor Martfn Almagro, who was re? cently assigned the Chair of Prehistory at the University of Madrid, considers that the thirty-four rock-shelters in Eastern Spain containing naturalistic paintings are the individual creation of another race or people; although the technique is more primitive, the vivid compositions show scenes illustrating hunting, dancing, war, gathering of natural produce, with fre- quent representation of humans; the fauna is post-Quaternary and includes domesti- cated animals, and the stone industry found in the shelters is post-Paleolithic. Almagro accepts the derivation of this art from the Perigordian art, but considers it a Meso-</page><page sequence="5">Spain and Portugal?Pericot, Alcobi, and Baroja 505 lithic development which persisted until the farming and metal-bearing colonizations arrived, to which later period the schematic rock art corresponds. Recently, Cam6n (1954) put forward an interesting theory in an attempt to explain the chronological and technical differences between the two Spanish cave arts. The Eastern style was attributed by Cam6n to an African influ? ence, which, in its turn, would have had a remote origin in the European Paleolithic. However, one must not lose sight of the importance in Spain of a population per- sisting for many millennia, whose origin lay in Gravettian culture. To make visiting easier, the Cantabrian caves are being carefully arranged, and electric lighting has been installed in the more interesting ones. During construction work of a path leading to the caves on Castillo Mountain (Puente Viesgo, Santan- der), two new caves with paintings were discovered, Cueva de las Monedas and Cueva de la Chimenea, thanks to the worthy attention of the engineer, A. Garcia Lorenzo. Las Monedas cave contained thirty- six partial paintings of a pre-Magdalenian aspect (deer, bison, a very big cave bear, reindeer (?), acephalous horses, and tecti- form signs). Ripoll made the copies on ex- hibit in Santander Museum (1952c; see also Gonzalez Echegaray, 1952a). New engrav- ings were found by Ripoll in Castillo and Pasiega caves (Gonzalez Echegaray, 1952b; Gonzalez Echegaray and Ripoll, 1954). The discovery of Magdalenian and upper Solu? trean levels in La Pasiega threw doubt on Carballo, who considered the paintings from this cave to be Aurignacian (1953). Jorda, on the basis of unpublished Mag? dalenian III and IV bone-engravings from Balmori cave (Llanes), suggested (1952b) that the naturalistic and schematic repre- sentations are contemporary, as is accepted by Pericot and Castillo. One of the figures in the schematic female form is similar to one from Bruniquel. Breuil visited the cave in Lledias and he accepted (in litteris) the authenticity of the paintings which had been much doubted. Engravings of fish and other signs appear on the entrance of the Cova de les Pates Penaes (Bats cave), Rotova. In Eastern Spain a few new discoveries were made. The most important of the publications referring to this region was the monograph of Almagro on Cogul (1952b), in which he stated that the shelter was used as a sanctuary until Roman times, and established a triple superimposition of paintings. The flints found at the base of the shelter and nearby were classified as Mesolithic of the type used by the hunting peoples until the Neolithic. The Iberian and Latin inscriptions of votive character demonstrated the continuity of the cult. Vilaseca reported (1954) on the rare find in Llod cave (Tarragona) of a goat's head in relief and engraved. It was very difficult to date. Jorda and Alcacer published the paintings from Dos Aguas (Valencia) which show various naturalistic and schematic styles including scenes of hunting, dancing and two women wearing long skirts, one with a basket and the other carrying a curved stick (collection scene ?). New copies have been made of the paintings from Secans shelter (Mazale6n, Teruel) by Val- lespf (1952; see also Beltran, 1954c) and from Les Dogues (Ares del Maestre, Cas- tell6n) by Porcar (1953). In the latter, a vivid battle appears between bowmen. Porcar's copies are of extraordinary liveli- ness. New important paintings have been discovered near Alcoy. Ortego discovered new paintings (1952) on Monte Valonsadero (Soria), where, be- sides the naturalistic East Spanish influ? ence, the semi-naturalistic and schematic figures predominate, representing hunting, pastoral, and agricultural scenes. Ortego discovered also other painting of quadru- peds, human figures, and signs in a rock- shelter called Cuerda del Torilejo. Neolithic and Beginning of the Metal Age The history of the Spanish Neolithic has undergone great changes owning to chron? ological revisions, racial study, and new points of view on the relationships with the Eastern Mediterranean. The work of San Valero (1954) is especially important as he employs historical methods, follow? ing the teaching of Santa Olalla. Accord? ing to his chronology, during the period</page><page sequence="6">506 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 from 3000-2000 B. C, the first oriental farmers arrived from the North African coast to constitute the Neolithic I A and B cultures, the Neolithic B peoples bringing cardial pottery. The excavations at San Quirze Neolithic site (Sabadell, Barcelona) yielded pit graves containing shrunken bodies. It is interest? ing to compare this culture with that from Lagozza (Panyella, 1952). Colominas pub? lished on other tombs from Caldas (1952). Also in Villafranca, three new pit graves containing shrunken bodies were excavated (Giro, 1954); the graves contained three trapezoid microliths and a turquoise neck- lace; one of the graves was of a later period and contained a copper arrowhead and an advanced type of pot. In the province of Tarragona, Vilaseca made an exhaustive study of numerous pre? historic sites with Neolithic, microlithic, and Campignian-like Aeneolithic indus? tries, which persisted until the Bronze Age. He produced an interesting study (1953a) on the position of these sites in relation to their geology, the economic basis of settle? ment, the analysis of industrial techniques, and the origin and extraction of the flint used. New flint deposits were noted in Cornudella. Vilaseca classified (1952b) the Moli dels Abur as Neolithic of a pseudo- Tardenoisian type, and Mas de l'Oliver and Barranc del Pataca as of Campignian type. A site which appeared to be a workshop was found near Massanet (Gerona) and produced a fine Neolithic knife, a bifacial arrowhead, and other implements (Riuro, 1954). An important cave was found in Serina (Gerona). Other Neolithic finds were noted, with? out being fully published, in the neighbor? hood of Gandia and other parts of Valencia province, in Villena (Alicante), in Tabernas (Almeria; excavated by the Seminario de Historia Primitiva del Hombre), in the Manzanares terraces and the area around Madrid, and in other provinces. The study of Spanish megaliths, stimu- lated by the work of Leisner and Pericot, has progressed in the last few years. The former collaborated with Cerdan to pro- duce a catalogue (Cerdan, Leisner and Leisner, 1952) of the megaliths in Huelva province, especially those of El Pozuelo, which are chambered passage graves, and those of La Zarcita, which are corbelled, similar to the one at San Bartolom6 de la Torre. The last has a type of "altar" in the principal chamber. Abundant flint imple- ments and extremely interesting pottery (one vase in the form of a bird and a four- footed rectangular vase) were found at Zar? cita. The architecture of the El Pozuelo megaliths is very varied, with the employ? ment of double passages, side chambers, and central pillars. There are rich grave- goods consisting of microlithic arrowheads, knives, cylindrical axes, anthropomorphic idols, engraved plaques, turquoise beads, and pottery; the hollow-base arrowheads indicate Atlantic influence mixing with the culture of pastoral Neolithic peoples who began the exploitation of copper mines. The settlement and megalithic necropo- lis at Los Millares (Almeria) continues to be of great interest for the study of the Spanish Neolithic and early Bronze Age, and interesting, though unpublished, re? sults have been obtained from the new ex? cavations directed by Almagro and Arribas. They also explored the megalith of Guaino alto, which is of the gallery type, but con? tained only plain pottery (Arribas, 1954). Almagro reported (1952c) on an idol with rayed eyes and incised hair of the type as? sociated with the western Hispano-Portu- guese culture, intermediate between those of Conquero and Vila Nova de San Pedro. He set forth the following typology for eyed idols: a) those on a horse or bovine pha- lanx, certainly of Cretan or Egyptian origin; they are dated to phase A at Los Millares and were later manufactured in marble; b) those painted on long bone and found only in Eastern Spain; c) stone cylinders or cones with neither signs nor marks. The eye motif is also found in the pottery (Los Millares) and the schematic paintings. In Catalonia some new megaliths were found. The dolmen of Mas Clami (Cas- telltersol, Barcelona) contained seven or eight skeletons, fragments of a bell-beaker,</page><page sequence="7">Spain and Portugal?Pericot, AlcobS, and Baroja 507 and a thumb-handled pot (Colominas, 1954). Barandiaran produced a summary (1953) of the Basque megaliths, which are the tombs of a pastoral people, belonging to the so-called western Pyrenean race to which the present day Basques also belong. The catalogue includes the 290 dolmens and some of the tumuli and cromlechs. The "Aranzadi" group of San Telmo Museum in San Sebastian continued the work of previous years in looking for dol? mens (EkSsegui, 1952a, b, 1953, 1954). E16segui published data on the eight new megaliths from Guipuzcoa, four more from Urbasa-Andia (Navarra), seven from El Roncal, Aralar, and Urbasa and two dol? mens and three tumuli from the Sierra de Andia (Navarra). Barandiaran published the data on various dolmens and cromlechs, and five more dolmens were noted by other authors. The report of the megaliths near Roncesvalles, drawn in 1926 by Baran? diaran and the late Aranzadi (1953), has now been published; the finds were very few. The number of known megaliths from Arag6n increased. New ones were found near Guarrinza and also in Ordesa, Bielsa, Gesera, and Nocito in the Sierra de Guara (Huesca). Beltran explored some of the de- stroyed cists at Biescas and excavated (1954a, b) the megalith at Lasaosa (Gesera). The bell-beaker is a type of pottery which constitutes a genuine style and has aroused the greatest interest among Span? ish archeologists. Castillo produced (1953, 1954b) a concise summary of the problems in which he discussed whether the bell- beaker type of pottery appears in distinct cultures, or is the basic type of a single cul? ture, as in the British Isles. In the Iberian Peninsula bell-beakers are associated with a great variety of tomb types; thus the latter alternative appears to be more prob? able. Castillo, like many other Spanish archeologists, believes that the origin of this pottery style should be sought in the cardial pottery of Southern Spain which is earlier and stylistically similar, although some types perhaps could have a remote origin in the Egyptian Tasian culture, as maintained by Childe and Santa Olalla. A report was published (Ferrer, 1954) on the discovery of two pots, decorated in the bell-beaker style, from the sepulchral cave of Batlle vell (Pontons, Barcelona); their form and associated grave goods indicated that they were late and belonged to the be? ginning of the Bronze Age II. Tarradell's excavations in the cave of Gar Cahal, near Ceuta (Spanish Morocco), in November 1954, means an important step in the study of bell-beakers. The stra? tigraphy of the cave provided useful in? formation on the Mauritanian industries from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age; several levels with bell-beakers of all the various Spanish types are decisive factors for the relative, and even the absolute, chronology of this type of pottery. In Portugal there was intense activity in the study of the Neolithic. Rusell Cortez has published extensive works on the Portu? guese Neolithic. He believes that the end of the occupation of the shell-mounds of Muge ought to be connected with the ar? rival of the farmers who were bearers of cylindrical axes and domesticators of the pig; pottery was found in the latest levels. The settlement of "Areias Altas" (Oporto) developed during the Epi-Paleolithic and persisted until an advanced Neolithic. Rusell discusses also the problem of earli? est megaliths. He considers that the Iberian Neolithic is of Mediterranean origin and, following Daniel's arguments, shows the impossibility of assembling in a single com? plex the two supposed megalithic streams, the one formed by inland farmers building gallery dolmens and the other by the builders of the passage-type megaliths and tholoi (1952). In 1950-1952, A. do Pa?o and M. L. Costa Arthur (1952a, b, c, 1953; Pac/&gt;, 1954) found a stratified zone and the remains of an interior wall of the central redoubt of Vila Nova de San Pedro. One of the strata corresponded to the earliest occupational phase of the settlement, and it is possible that the interior redoubt belongs to this phase. Above this first level and next to the wall, they found a pottery oven and a</page><page sequence="8">508 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 well. The finds from the earliest phase con? sist of abundant flints and pottery, among which appears a very fine red burnished ware, thought to be imported, perhaps, by the first foreign colonizers who combined with the native population to create the magnificent settlement at Vila Nova de San Pedro. The flax seeds collected by Jal- hay have been classified as Linum humile mill., a species originally cultivated in Asia Minor; their presence confirms the theory that linen was cultivated before the Celtic invasions. Do Pa^o and Arthur published the profiles of the undecorated pottery which show very simple forms. Two samples of metal were analyzed and gave very un- equal results; one sample was of almost pure copper, and the other was of bronze with 87.93% copper and 10.38% tin. The richest megalithic area in Portugal, the data on which has been fully published, is that of Caldas de Monchique (Viana and Dias, 1952). The megaliths belong to two groups: one Eneolithic, comprising thirty cists or small galleries covered by a tumu- lus. Although the majority have been de- stroyed, they produced abundant polished stone tools and flints (triangular and trape- zoid microliths) and ornaments (plaque idols, pendants, turquoise and slate beads). Another megalithic area discovered in 1952 is that of Lousal (Grandola). It con? tains an interesting monument resembling the already noted Huelva megaliths in its passage separating two chambers, and in its technique of construction. The site con? tained an archer's bracer, a lanceolate cop? per arrowhead, two beads, and a carinated beaker (Veigas and Rodrigues, 1952; For- mosinho, Veiga, and Viana, 1953). Dias de Deus and Viana excavated three new megaliths in Elvas, all with a polygonal chamber and a passage. The grave goods were rich in pottery, flint, beads, and many axes. The Odivelas megalith was even richer and contained big flint knives, much pottery, decorated slate plaques, and orna? ments (Viana, 1953). The passage dolmen in Agualva, which had an almost circular corbelled chamber, contained abundant finds, consisting of bell-beakers, bone but- tons of tortoise form, stone and bone cylinders, boar tusks, flint weapons, tur- quoise beads, and a copper awl (Veiga, 1953). The City Museum of Lisbon keeps some important finds from Monsanto, among which are fragments of twelve incised bell- beakers and many other decorated pots (Paco and Bartholo, 1954). Da Veiga and Trinidade gave a prelimi? nary report (1954) on the Eneolithic idols from two graves in the necropolis of "Cabec/) da Arruda." One is a tholos-type tomb of the bell-beaker period, and the other is somewhat earlier. Six of the idols have the shape of a rabbit, two are pear- shaped, and there are also a limestone crescent and an engraved and perforated marble plaque. Museums The new Archeological Museum of Oviedo is of great interest for its Paleolithic collection. The present director is F. Jorda. The museum contains a very important series of material from various Aisturian sites, where much still remains to be studied. P. J. Carballo and P. J. Gonzalez Eche- garay are director and subdirector, respec- tively, of the Santander Prehistoric Mu? seum, which has been greatly enriched by the finds from Pendo and other caves. The exhibition space has been extended, and it is the hope of the Diputaci6n Provincial to erect soon a new building. The Archeological Museum of Bilbao which contains finds from the cave of San- timamine, besides other material mainly ethnographical, is also considering a new and better installation. The Museum of San Telmo in San Se- bastian, which is excellently organized, keeps archeological and ethnographical material. The Prehistory room contains nu? merous Paleolithic remains, including the Magdalenian finds from the cave of Ur- quiaga, and pottery, tools, and human remains from many of the Basque dolmens. The museum of Vitoria also has been renovated. The Pamplona Museum, of which Miss Mezquiriz has been nominated curator, is</page><page sequence="9">Spain and Portugal?Pericot, Alcobi, and Baroja 509 in the course of installation in a splendid manner. It is very rich in Hallstatt material (excavation of the Celtic settlement of Cortes by J. Maluquer on behalf of the Instituci6n Principe de Viana), and also possesses dolmen material. The total renovation of the Cantabrian museums without doubt will have reper- cussions on the investigation of the Paleo? lithic in this rich area. The renovation of the Galician mu? seums is also under way. The beautiful in? stallation of the Pontevedra Museum with rich collections of jewelry of the Bronze Age, under the direction of J. Filgueira, deserves special mention. In Catalonia, the reorganization of Banolas Museum was completed, displaying very rich Paleolithic and Neolithic material, the former mainly from Reclau Viver cave (Serina) with Solutrean and Gravettian horizons. The famous Neandertal mandi- ble is permanently in the Alsius collection at Banolas. The Archeological Museum of Gerona received additions to its Paleolithic and Neolithic series, including the Bosoms col? lection from the Magdalenian layer of Bora Gran (SeriM). P. Palol and M. Oliva are in charge. The Archeological Museum of Barcelona (Director, M. Almagro), although it added only a few items to its Paleolithic and Neo? lithic collections, extended and improved its display, and one can safely say that at present it is the most active center for all investigations into Spanish prehistory. The Museum of Prehistory in Valencia was in the process of installation. New ma? terial from the caves of Mallaetes, Barranc Blanc, Cova Negra, Llatas, and from the settlement at Navarr^s has especially en- riched it. It is under the direction of D. Fletcher and E. Pla. With regard to the National Archeologi? cal Museum in Madrid, its display was completely reorganized when it was re- opened in April 1954 for the IVth Interna? tional Congress of Prehistoric and Proto? historic Sciences. A selection of material from the large Paleolithic and Neolithic collections covering the whole of Spain was on display. Of special interest was the ma? terial from the Siret collection, closed dur? ing many years, which has important Neo? lithic series, besides very fine Solutrean and Gravettian pieces, all from southeast Spain. The Director is J. Navascu?s. The collection in the Seminario de His? toria Primitiva del Hombre (Philosophy and Letters Faculty of the Madrid Uni? versity) also was installed within the past few years by J. Martinez Santa Olalla. It is primarily a study collection, but also con? tains Lower Paleolithic material obtained during recent years from the excavations in the Manzanares terraces. Other Spanish archeological museums whose collections are being renovated are: Almeria, Alicante, M&amp;laga, Segovia, Zara- goza, Albacete, Murcia, and Cartagena. Scientific Meetings During the period under review, inter? national contacts were developed through the many courses and scientific meetings which were held. Barcelona University continued the In? ternational Course on Prehistory and Ar? cheology directed by Almagro and Pericot, mainly in Ampurias (VI, 1952; VII, 1953; VIII, 1954). The collaboration with the Institute for Ligurian Studies (Secretary, N. Lamboglia) led to the excavation of the Pipistrelli cave (Finale, Liguria, Italy) by M. Almagro. The IHrd National Congress of Arche? ology was celebrated in July 1953 in Galicia and northern Portugal. It was presided over by Admiral Bastarreche, with Beltran as Secretary. The Ist Archeological Congress of Span? ish Morocco was organized in June 1953 by the "Delegacion de Cultura de la Alta Comisaria de Espana en Marruecos" and the Archeological Museum of Tetuan, with the Museum Director, M. Tarradell, as Sec? retary. The representatives of ten countries were present. Jaca developed courses in archeological technique, organized by Zaragoza Uni? versity and directed by A. Beltran. The First International Course in Field Archeology, organized by the "Comisaria</page><page sequence="10">510 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 General de Excavaciones Arqueol6gicas" under the direction of J. Martinez Santa Olalla, took place in Granada in September 1953. The IVth International Congress of Pre? historic and Protohistoric Sciences met in Madrid from 21 to 27 April 1954, under the Presidency of L. Pericot, with A. Bel- tran as Secretary. It was preceded and fol? lowed by excursions to the most interesting Spanish prehistoric sites, especially to San- tander and the Cantabrian painted caves. Four hundred prehistorians assembled for this occasiQn. A special exhibition of the Spanish "Arte levantino" was organized. The celebration of this Congress gave a new impulse to Spanish prehistory. physical anthropology2 Chairs, Institutions, and Societies There exist in Spain two university chairs for physical anthropology, in Madrid and Barcelona, whose instruction is ob- ligatory for the scholars of biological sci? ences. In addition, as a research organiza? tion, the "Instituto Bernardino de Sahagiin de Antropologia y Etnologia" belongs to the "Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientfficas" and also has Sections in Ma? drid and Barcelona. The Institute pub- lishes a review, Antropologia y Etnologia, as well as a separate series of papers under the title Trabajos del Instituto Bernardino de Sahagun. Mention must also be made of the Sociedad Espaiiola de Antropologia, Etnografia y Prehistoria (Madrid), and its publications. In Portugal, there are chairs for anthro? pology in the Universities of Lisbon, Porto, and Coimbra, and the following societies should be noted: Sociedade Portuguesa de Antropologia e Etnologia (Porto), Soci? edade Portuguesa de Estudos Eug?nicos (Coimbra), and the Sociedade Anat6mica Portuguesa which has a Section for physi? cal anthropology. 2 The writer apologizes if important facts con? cerning Portugal are omitted due to circumstances beyond his control. He owes thanks to Professor dos Santos Junior (Porto) for much information about anthropological activities in that country. Prehistoric and Historic Human Remains Besides a general review concerning the Homo neandertalensis published by An- d?rez (1954a), a parietal bone, found by Vifies in 1933 in a Mousterian layer of Cova Negra (Valencia) and heretofore not studied, was described by Fust? (1953b). According to its morphological correla- tions, this fragment belongs to a "classical Neandertalian," differing from those of Gibraltar and Saccopastore which consti? tute a Mediterranean variety after G. Sergi. Therefore, these two somewhat different forms of Neandertal Man lived in the Iberian Peninsula. The excavations of the cave of Barranc Blanc (Valencia. See also pp. 502, 503) de? livered first a frontal bone (1951) assigned to the Epigravettian period after study by AlcoW. Its features showed similarity with the North African Cromagnonoids of the Mechta-Afalou type, rather than with the European ones, and the accordance may be extended in space and time to the his? torical Guanches of the Canary Islands, adding thus some suggestions to the prob? lem of the relations and biodynamics of the western Mediterranean populations during the Upper Paleolithic and their ul- terior co-sequences. Excavations were pur- sued at the same site in 1953 where many other fragments of human bones were found, also from an Epigravettian layer. A single, nearly complete juvenile skull was reconstructed, showing clear Cromagno- noid traits in the face, although the vault seemed more similar to the subsequent Mediterranean racial types. At this writing, the findings from Barranc Blanc were unpublished. Another skull, possibly Upper Paleo? lithic, was mentioned by And^rez (1954b). It was found by Garcia Lorenzo in the cave of Santian (Santander). This specimen is essentially Cromagnonoid, but with some features resembling Neandertalian. How? ever, the circumstances of this finding do not permit its definite assignment to any well-established period. Once more in 1953 and 1954, the Kjioek- kenmoeddings of Muge (Portugal) were ex- plored under the supervision of Professor</page><page sequence="11">Spain and Portugal?Pericot, Alcobi, and Baroja 511 Mendes Corr6a. An important series of skeletons was studied by this author and communicated to the IVth International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences in April 1954. Concerning Neolithic populations, Fust? (1952a) investigated the remains from the site of San Quirze de Galliners (Sabadell, Barcelona). This was a composite popula? tion of Mediterraneans and some so-called "negroids," which were interpreted as being genetically independent from true Negro stock and which represented only survivals of certain Paleolithic human types. Fust?, who worked for a time in Paris under the direction of Professor Val- lois, also wrote a paper (1952b) dealing with the human remains from the Dolmen des Bretons (Marne, France). He empha- sized the predominance of Alpine racial types. Two repertories detailing the principal Spanish finds of prehistoric human remains were composed by Alcob? (1952b, 1954). The first gave information about Paleo? lithic Man. The second, which was printed as a Guide on the occasion of the IVth International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences held in Madrid, ex? tended to the Neolithic and was preceded by an interpretative synthesis. With regard to historical times, some Portuguese authors (Serra, Albuquerque, and Neto, 1952) paid attention to the skeletons from a Visigothic necropole in Silveirona (Evora District). The character? istics of this population did not differ very much from those of the present Portuguese, and showed no significant differences from other Visigothic series, including those known in Spain. Therefore, it seems that the Nordic invaders have been strongly mixed with the peninsular peoples, and the racial influence of the former may have been exaggerated. In Spain, the skeletons from the Visigothic necropole of Madrona (Segovia) were studied by Schwidetzky (Mainz), at the request of the "Comisaria General de Excavaciones," though at the present writing, the findings are unpub- lished. In an interesting miscellaneous work, Mendes Corr6a (1954) dealt with several problems connecting anthropology with prehistoric and historical events, especially in Portugal, its colonies, and Brazil. Geographical Anthropology The well-known Spanish anthropologist Hoyos Sainz, recently deceased, attempted to delimit anthropogeographical regions in Spain, and, after comparing stature and ce- phalic index from both sides of the bound? ary between Spain and Portugal, concluded (1952a) that except for small local differ? ences, the political frontier did not separate essentially distinct populations. Dealing separately with the single Province of Malaga in southern Spain, the same author stated that the racial composition of its inhabitants is more complex than in the majority of other Spanish provinces. Altava, Villalonga and Barrera (1953) attempted to distinguish the most conspicuous human types in the Province of Castell6n. In Por? tugal, Athayde (1953) statistically analyzed several features of people born in the Dis? trict Braganc.a. At this writing, he was col- lecting data in the Porto district. Mateus (1952, 1953a, b) and Oliveira Mateus (1952, 1953) gave data about ce- phalic index, stature, robustness, metrical correlations, and mongoloid traits among Portuguese Guinea Negroes, and Athayde dealt with their dynamometry and ergogra- phy (1952). AlcoW wrote a chapter (1952b) for the first volume of Historia Mundi. Robles analyzed a series of native women from Spanish Morocco (1953). Blood Groups In a general statement for Spain, only the Basques being excepted, Guasch and others (1952) found a relatively high fre? quency for blood group A in Galicia and for B in Andalusia and the Canary Islands, while no significant regional differences for A19 A2, AXB and A2B could be ascer- tained. For the Rh system the results showed low rr and high D cc ee frequencies in the Canary Islands and homogeneity for continental Spain, whose inhabitants could be expected to be more similar to those of</page><page sequence="12">512 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 France and England. Examining blood donors in the Province of Barcelona, Grifols-Lucas and Manau (1952) gave sev? eral chromosome frequencies for the Rh system. Serra (1952) pointed out a distinction in the gene frequencies for ABO between the populations of Spain and Portugal, taken as a whole, consisting of a higher frequency of the p-gene among the Portuguese. He also stated differences with North Africa, where the q-frequency was greater. In gen? eral, more resemblances between Portugal and the Atlantic countries should be ex? pected and, on the contrary, more differ? ences expected with the populations of the Mediterranean basin. Dermatoglyphics Departing from an analysis of finger and palm prints of scholars of the University of Barcelona and of Spanish Guinea Ne? groes (collected by Alcob? and Fernandez Cabeza), and comparing them with many other groups, Pons pointed out a criterion (1952a, b; 1953a, c) for the differentiation of the three great racial stems. The differ? ences among more restricted groups, e.g., African Pygmies, Khoisanids, Eskimo, and Amerindians, were also appreciated. At this writing, several papers dealing with the dermatoglyphics of Portuguese Guinea Ne? groes and of natives from Timor are in preparation by Leopoldina Ferreira. Working in Rome, at Professor Gini's request, Pons also analyzed (1953b) finger and palm prints of several other popula? tions collected by the Comitato Italiano per lo Studio dei Problemi della Popola- zione. It was proved that the Bantu from Natal were in accordance with the Negro's variability, as the Polish Caraites were in regard to the Europeans. The Berbers from Giado, through their affinity with Euro? pean groups, showed some tendency to? ward the Negro characteristics, while the Dauada of Fezzan did not agree neatly with any of the three great racial stems, a fact in accordance with their mixtures and gen? eral morphology. By means of linear discriminant func? tions, the probability of assignment of an individual to a given group can be ascer- tained by dermatoglyphics, Pons main- tained. He also dealt (1954) with the inheritance of the main palm lines. He veri- fied that its obliquity is an hereditary char? acter, where several genes are probably involved. A polymer, with genes of additive effect, is to be kept in sight. Growth The brothers Ferndndez Cabeza illus? trated the growth of Spanish children. Their research (1952, 1953) referred to the Andalusian Provinces, Malaga and Gra- nada. With data taken in preceding genera? tions for comparison, they verified an in? crease in stature for the same age groups as they observed previously in Asturias and as Prevosti found in Barcelona. This is a well- known and nearly general occurrence, in spite of the fact that Spanish children were underfed during a part of their lives, due to the war and postwar difficulties. Never- theless, this apparently has had no influ? ence upon length of the body's growth, but perhaps only upon the width dimensions. On the other hand, the growth rate is greater of peoples in southern Spain, though they attain shorter statures, than those in the northern provinces. In bio- types, the majority of individuals are slen- der, macroschelic, hypobaric, and have good lung capacities. Other Studies To review other subjects which deserve mention, there is Albuquerque's study (1952) dealing with the jaw-bone, in which, after comparisons with many other popula? tions, he argued critically on the taxonomic usefulness of each single character. Sanchez y Sanchez (1952) gave absolute and rela? tive values for the upper extremity of uni? versity scholars from northwestern Spain, comparing them with other groups in and out of this country. Ferreira established (1952) sexual differences for the hand pro? portions of Portuguese. The vital capacity of the lungs of Spanish officers and soldiers was determined by Hernandez Gim?nez and others (1953), who calculated also its</page><page sequence="13">Spain and Portugal?Pericot, Alcobi, and Baroja 513 correlation with stature, weight, and thoracic perimeters. Mendes Corr?a (1953b) dealt usefully with personal identification and twins; and Alcob? (1953a) with the inheritance of Fabism, i.e., a hematic disorder related with Thalassanemia or Cooley's anemia due to a specific response from eating or smelling Vitia faba, the large bean. These researches were accomplished on the island of Minorca, one of the most conspicuous fo- cuses of Fabism among the Mediterranean countries. Knowledge of it is of anthro? pological interest, not only because of its restricted geographical localization, but also because of its restricted incidence to the western part of that island where the population is strongly endogamous. The eastern part is nearly free from Fabism. The predisposition to such a disease should be inherited in the same way as allergies and agrees with the Wiener-Zieve-Fries hypothesis. Expeditions Directed by Professor Ant6nio Almeida, three expeditions took place to Portuguese overseas territories: Angola (1952), Timor (1953), and Sao Tom? and Prfncipe (1954). At this writing, Antonio de Veciana was collecting further data in Spanish Guinea, committed by the Instituto de Estudios Africanos (Consejo Superior de Investiga- ciones Cientificas). Scientific Meetings Communications on physical anthro? pology, made before the IVth International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences in April 1954, were as follows: Mendes Corr?a, on human remains from Muge; Alcob?, on fossil man in Eastern Spain; and Fust?, on the survival of Paleo? lithic human types in Eastern Spain. To the IVth International Congress for Mediterranean Hygiene and Medicine (1953) research on Fabism was presented, the clinical part of which was attended by Surinyach and Llebarfa (Barcelona) and Marcolongo (Cagliari, Italy). In September 1954, the International Congress of Pyreneists, which alternatively meets in France and Spain, took place in Luchon (France, Pyrenees). Spanish com- munications presented were: Alcobe\ on the physical anthropology of the Valleys of Baztan and A?zcoa (Navarra); Pons, on dermatoglyphics among the Basques; and Fuste\ on Neolithic populations in the Pyrenees. An International Course on Paleontology was held in 1954 in Sabadell (Barcelona), under the direction of the Spanish pale- ontologist, Miguel Crusafont. The Paleo- anthropological lectures were: "Consider- azioni su alcune recenti scoperte paleantro- pologiche," by Piero Leonardi (Ferrara); "R?cents progr&amp;s de la Pateontologie Hu- maine en France," by Jean Piveteau (Paris); and "The Fossil Man of Java," by G. H. R. von Koenigswald (Utrecht). ETHNOLOGY Educational Institutions The most outstanding event of 1954 was the declaration that ethnology was to be officially included in the Departments of Philosophy and Letters in Spanish universi? ties. As yet, however, Chairs have not been endowed and it can be foreseen that eth? nology will, after a time, be relegated to a provisional position. The urgency of insti- tuting this type of study in Spain has been publicly proclaimed by Angel Alvarez de Miranda, Catedralico de Historia de las Religiones de la Universidad de Madrid, and others, as well as by groups such as the Sociedad de Etnologia y Folklore and the Instituto General Franco de Estudios de Investigaci6n Hispano-Arabe. In Portugal, Professor A. A. Mendes Cor- rea continued to preside over the Chair of Ethnology of the Instituto Superior de Estudos Ultramarinos. In 1954, a new Cen? tro de Estudos de Etnologia do Ultramar was formed, under the directorship of Pro? fessor Antonio Almeida, which seemed to be a new designation of the Escola Superior of the Instituto Superior.</page><page sequence="14">514 Yearbook of Anthropology?1955 Research Institutions and Museums The most interesting activity in Spain during the period under review was the completion of the Instituto de Estudios Africanos. The Instituto is subordinate to the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientfficas, and perpetuated, to a large ex? tent, by the Direcci6n General de Mar- ruecos y Colonias, both under the direc? tion of D. Jos? Diaz de Villegas. The work of the Instituto applies to the four zones in Africa of Spanish Morocco, Ifni Terri? tory, Spanish Sahara, and Spanish Guinea and adjacent islands. With respect to re? search conducted in Morocco, the extensive work on the social economies of Morocco carried out by T. Garcia Figueras and R. de Roda Jimeniz was published in two volumes (1950/1952). Arcadio de Larrea Palacin's three-volume work on Jewish music of Northern Morocco was published (1952). Apart from these major works, several interesting publications on indige? nous elements deserve mention. They are Mohammed Ibn Azzuz Haquim's volume on Moroccan proverbs (1954); Sidi Ahmad R'Honi's volume containing many odd so? cial and economic details of Tetuan (1953); and Abraham I. Laredo's historical-cul- tural study on the Berbers and Hebrews in Morocco (1954). Those scholars with a spe? cial interest in the Moroccan region are Julio Cola Alberich, P. P. Garcia Barriuso, T. Garcia Figueras, F. Esteban Ibanez, Ar? cadio de Larrea Palacin, and Jos? A. San- chez Perez. As regards the Ifni Territory, in addition to the publications of Colonel Domenech and several officials and employees who had worked there from 1940-1950, the appear? ance of P. E. Esteban Ibanez's Diccionario Espanol-baamarans (1954) was of signifi? cance. Though Arcadio de Larrea has been at work in the field of musicology in the area, the results of his work have not as yet been published. In the Sahara, where ethnographic re? ports have been made by Domenech, A. Flores, and several military men stationed there, ethnographic research has not been as intensive as research by naturalists and archeologists. Julio Caro Baroja (1955) and Miguel Molina Campuzano (1954) com? pleted a field trip to the Sahara from November, 1952 to February, 1953, for the Instituto de Estudios Africanos, and published their results. In our opinion, the two reports should be considered as of a very provisional nature as only repeated trips to such a large area will provide accu- rate and complete information. In Spanish Guinea, Gonzalez Echegaray was at work on indigenous linguistics, the Pamue mythology, and other cultural themes, though the results of his research have not yet been published. Both D. A. Panyella, Director of the Museo Etnol6gico de Barcelona and Professor Santiago Alcob? have conducted socio-anthropological re? search in Spanish Guinea, though no re? ports have appeared as yet. Among publica? tions by natives written in Spanish, the work of F. J. Mopila (1949) deserves mention. In Portugal, Professor Manuel Heleno was the President of the Instituto Portugue* de Arqueologia, Historia e Etnografia in Lisbon.8 Two other institutions which ex? hibited great vitality with reference to metropolitan ethnology were the Centro de Estudos de Etnologia Peninsular at Porto and the Comissao de Etnografia e Historia da Provincia do Douro Litoral, also at Porto. Both issued several publications dur? ing the period. In collaboration with Fer- nando Galhano, Jorge Dias published the results of a study (1953) on the forms and distribution of the ingenious methods of irrigation in Portugal, which was of unde- niable worth from the historical-cultural point of view. His monograph on the Rio de Onor, a community on the frontier of Spain and Portugal also appeared (1953). His methods were eminently descriptive and ethnographic. Jos? Gonzalo C. Hercu- lano de Carvalho completed a thesis (1953), which is not only of ethnographic but also of linguistic interest, on the threshing sys? tems of Spain and Portugal. Among the foreigners who arrived to study Spanish socio-anthropology, Julian s The above information was supplied by Profes? sor dos Santos Junior through Professor Alcobe\</page><page sequence="15">Spain and Portugal?Pericot, Alcobi, and Baroia 515 Pitt-Rivers ol Oxford made an important contribution (1954). Though there are also other important scholars, George M. Foster, Jr., of the University of California, stood as the most steadfast example of the col? laboration between North American and Spanish social and cultural anthropologists. It should be noted that there has been a resurgence in Spain of the works of the Basque pre-historian and folklorist, J. M. de Barandiaran and an interest in Basque studies by several North American investi- gators, among them, John Chictaine of the University of Arizona.
