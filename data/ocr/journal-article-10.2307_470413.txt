<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARTISTIC UNITY OF GIL VICENTE'S AUTO DA SIBILA CASANDRA P ROFESSOR Thomas R. Hart was, I believe, well-inspired in objecting (Hisp. Rev. XXVI, 35 seq.) to the assessment by Ticknor of Gil Vicente's Auto da Sibila Casandra as a hodgepodge of religious and secular themes, as "an incongruous drama; a strange union of the spirit of the ancient mystery and of a modern vaudeville." By a painstaking analysis of the text (which must necessarily entail a great number of new observations) Mr. IIart attempts to show that the play has inner unity and coherence and this demonstration will remain undisputed even though other critics should see the undoubtable unity of the auto in a different light. This is indeed my own position which I may be allowed to develop in the conviction that ovLc ooXSbo ye, continuous discussion and rediscussion, can alone bring us to an approximation to Truth in literary as well as in scientific matters. Whereas Mr. Hart sees the dramatic unity of the auto "not so much in the interrelationships of the things that are said and done on the stage as in the relationship of the things that are symboli- cally, or, if one prefers, allegorically implied in them," I would propose a more literal explanation of the text which would also include an aesthetic evaluation. Let us begin with the one point which seems to me essential in the play, the motif of the false prophecy which is indicated already in the title: "the Auto of the Sibyl Casandra." The coupling of these two names is strange and must be explained. Since three other Sibyls appear in the play and oppose their views to Casandra's we must assume that the latter has something in common with them, and at the same time differs from them: obviously, she is a Sibyl in the sense that she is a prophetess and, more specifically, a prophetess of the birth of Christ from the flesh of a virgin, as are the other Sibyls, but she, wrongly and sacrilegiously, prophesies that the Redeemer will be born from herself. The other Sibyls prophesy objective truths, joining the Jewish patriarchs in the announcement of Mary as the Redeemer's mother. Perhaps a clue is already given in the title to Casandra's egotistic nature: the 56</page><page sequence="2">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 57 Casandra who prophesies pro domo sua is, as it were, called 'the Sibyl that prophesies for Casandra's sake,' whereas the other Sibyls are named impersonally according to their geographical origin (Erutea &lt; Erythrea, Peresica &lt; Persica, Cumeria &lt; Cumaea, a fourth sibyl, Africana, elsewhere called Libyca, is mentioned in the play, p. 74). The play's central theme is then that of prophecy. All the dramatis personae assume the r8le of 'prophets' and all, except Casandra, are prophets of Christ's birth from Mary: the Old Testamentary patriarchs Abraham, Moses and Isaiah (and also Solomon of whom it is said p. 73: Y tu tambie'n Salomon, / buen gargon, / los cantares que hacias / eran prophecias)1 as well as the Sibyls. We have here before us the well-known topos of pre- figuration or Realprophetie 2 as the late Professor Auerbach has called the figurative-anticipative linking, in patristic and vernacu- lar medieval literature, of pre-Christian figures and events with Christian figures and events in which they culminate, brought on stage in a manner reminiscent of the 'Play of the Prophets,' with the additional feature (well-known from the Dies irae: teste David I cum Sibylla) of the union between the Old Testamentary and the pagan world in a common 'prophecy' of the age of Christ (with the result that space and time seem to shrink in the pre-Christian age) . It is to this cosmos united in the expectation of the Reedemer that Casandra with her personal hybris and her consequent tragic 1 I am quoting the text according to Marques Braga's edition in Obras completas I. 2 Auerbach distinguishes sharply Realprophetie from allegory: while the latter establishes a connection between a concrete fact and an abstract con- cept, the former connects concrete with other concrete facts: 'real figures of history' are made to prophesy spiritually a 'fulfilment' in time. Our play seems to me a typical example of Realprophetie, while other autos of Gil Vicente stage allegorical figures such as the four seasons of the year or Faith, Prudence, Humility, etc. 3 In Gil Vicente's Auto dos quatro tempos David appears as a prophet of the new dispensation after the pagan gods have abdicated. 4 Professor Bruce W. Wardropper in his book Introduccidn al teatro religioso del siglo de oro, p. 166, has called attention to the "compresi6n de la historia," to the "abandono expreso del tiempo cronol6gico" in our Auto which will be an important factor in the subsequent development of the autos sacramentales. Once the achievement of compressed historical time penetrated into drama, later "cultural syntheses" in dramatic form became possible: the marriage of Faust and Helena in Goethe's world-drama is in the same line of tradition.</page><page sequence="3">58 Leo Spitzer Hi, XXVII (1959) isolation opposes herself, though the harmony disturbed by her alone will be reistablished at the end when she too will bow in adoration to Mary, the true mother of God, who accepted the mes- sage of the angel with humility and with whom Casandra had been contrasted before by the patriarchs. It is as if the whole final scene of the Adoration were staged for her especially, for her con- version, for her entrance into the fold of the believers. The 'un- sibylline' Sibyl Casandra, a kind of Anti-Mary or Counter-Mary, had prescience without charity, she was unredeemedly pagan in her desire to raise herself above common mankind to the level of the immortals, taking her place among other legendary figures of an- tiquity rivalling with the gods, but the one discordant voice in the concert of Christian prophesies must finally become attuned to the harmony that appeared in the world with the glorious event of the Nativity that took place in the year 0 A.D. and can be re- enacted in the 16th as well as in any other century A.D. Any conversion that took place at any time is exemplary for all times, for every sinner has in himself the potentiality of the felix culpa which can be expiated after the coming of the Redeemer. Still continuing with the title, that is remaining within the artistic framework of our play--we must ask ourselves why the protagonist is called Casandra (since such a name suggests imme- diately definite connotations). Why did the Cassandra of Troy, the prophetess of disaster never listened to by her countrymen, become a false, un-Christian prophetess of personal glory and there- fore not listened to by the other 'prophets'? Here the erudition of Dona Carolina Michailis de Vasconcelos is of great help. In her book Notas vicentinas, p. 346, she has proved that it was tradi- tional to conceive of the Sibyls as 'prophets of Christ' (Castillejo: Una sibila pagana / que a Christo no conocia / antes lo prophetiz6 / que 'l tomase carne umana) and that in another play (Mistirios da Virgem) Gil Vicente took the further step of identifying Casan- dra with the Christ-prophesying Sibyls (Casandra [a] del rei Pridmo / monstrou essa rosa-frol [= the Virgin] / corn um menino a par do sol / a Cesar Octaviano / que o adorou por Senhor). While Cassandra appears here in the traditional r61e of the Chris- tianized Sibyl, in our play Gil Vicente-according to Dona Caro- lina-had the startling idea that Casandra's prophesy of Christ should involve herself as the mother. Relying on this insight,</page><page sequence="4">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 59 Dona Carolina was able to write, obviously addressing herself to detractors of the play, that it "de estranho 5 se torna saboroso, quando lido comrn plena compreensao da maneira e arte do poeta, e dos elementos constituentes. .. ." But if it was Gil Vicente's own idea to make Casandra wish to become Christ's mother were there no ancient antecedents for such a desire ? For this question we must consult, not Dona Carolina, but Eduard Norden, who in his book Aeneis, Buch VI, commenting on the phrase plena deo,6 supposedly used of the Cumaean Sibyl by Vergil in an unpreserved version of his Aeneid, points to the use in antiquity of p7&amp;'aui b6PVbara in reference to prophetesses: the act of prophesying was seen as an act of love of the god Apollo (with Pausanias the Erythrean Sibyl called herself yvaZKca 'ya~Trv, the married wife of the god), as fe- cundation by the god (Servius built on this belief his etymology of the name Cumae, the seat of the Cumaean Sibyl: Cumas vocarunt ... a gravidae mulieris augurio quae graece ~iKUvoS [--'pregnant'] dicitur, and Lucan says of the Pythian priestess: hoc ubi virgineo conceptum est pectore numen). Again, the gift of prophesy may be the result of a compromise 7 with the god: the prophetess denies him her body, but must yield to the invasion of her mind by the god who bestows on her the gift of prophesy. This is what hap- pened to the Cumaean Sibyl according to Ovid (Metam. 14, 132), to the Delphic priestess (according to Origen)-and to Cassandra, the IcWTELS KpaC of Pindar (according to Hyginus). There obviously exists, within the prophetic nature, a dialectic tension between the pure being which alone can rise spiritually above the level of common humanity and the openness to divine fecundation. The 5 Dona Carolina writes this word in italics, obviously in reference to Ticknor's choice of this epithet. Although she has not developed more in detail the aesthetic qualities of the play, she may make us qualify Mr. Hart's statement: "No later critic, so far as I know, has quarrelled with Ticknor's assessment of the play. ... ." 6-which may perhaps be echoed in our play by Peresica's words, p. 69: liena estoy de profecias. 7 In the playful world of ancient metamorphoses such compromises, as it were, between the divine powers vested in man and his congenital limitations, are frequent: f. ex. Tiresias who has antagonized Juno by his judgment in her quarrel with Jupiter is blinded by the goddess, but given the gift of prophecy by the god. In the mythological world of the Metamorphoses certain ontological conflicts within man are presented as a struggle between man and the deities, between semi-divine man and anthropomorphic gods.</page><page sequence="5">60 Leo Spitzer HR, XXVII (1959) wording in the passage in which Origen pokes fun at the Delphic priestess: i' ro6 'Ar6oXXPos 7rpoOrfpL srX art rev^EUa bLd a v yvvatKEL&amp;V K6Xrowv 'Apollo's prophetess accepts the spirit in the womanly womb' shows the double nature (rwPEva-K6X7ro0) of the virgin-priestess fecundated by the God's spirit (-a condition which comes close to that of Mary, the Virgin adumbrated by the Holy Ghost). It was then a subtle idea of Gil Vicente-who may not have known all that Norden knows, but may have been sufficiently imbued with the numinose aspect of ancient prophesy-to contrast the dream of the pagan virgin with Mary's Christian reality. And no praise is sufficient for the skilful treatment of the figure of Casandra as it is revealed to the spectator in the different scenes of the play. The hybris and monomania of her character (saiia- locura are the terms applied to her) appear as fixed from the start in the opening scenes, but it is only gradually that we come to realize the full extent of her criminal thought-and when we finally become aware of this (in the second to last scene) Casandra's expia- tion will immediately follow, in one of those sudden illuminations of which Christian drama offers so many examples (cf. Segismundo's sudden change in La vida es suefo). Greek tragedy shows us man crushed by a fate inexplicable to him whereas Christian drama, untragic and optimistic in nature, shows us often the forces of a benign providence interested in the salvation of a sinner. The whole play is directed toward the final scene in which Casandra will take her place in the group of those who worship the coming of the Savior. As to the direction of Casandra's ambition we learn in her opening monologue only of her fixed determination not to marry, inspired by her conviction of superiority to all shepherds en cuerpo, vista y sentido (note the emphasis on both her beauty and intel- ligence !)1 and by a craving for freedom-an attitude not abnormal s One could contrast the description of Casandra in our play with that of the Roman de Troie, ed. Constant, I, 289: Cassandra fu de tel grandor Que ne pot estre de meillor; Rose ot la chiere e lentillose. Merveilles est escientose . . . Les ieuz ot clerz e reluisanz. Toz est divers li suens semblanz E sis estres e sis pensez Ert d'autres femmes devisez.</page><page sequence="6">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 61 in a young, headstrong girl. In the following dialogue with Solo- mon who comes to woo her she will reveal her negative judgment about the marriages she has seen and express still more strongly her love of freedom: she wishes freedom from all bonds, those of the family (she is disregarding the wish of her mother and her aunts who advise marriage), those of marriage, those of the con- vent 9 (no quiero ser desposada / ni casada / ni monja ni ermitaia -I take ni casada ni monja as disjunctives: 'I wish to become neither the bride of a man nor of God'). And what is more, she tells Solomon that this attitude of hers was born with her (naci6 quando naci / comigo esta opinion). With this remark there is mentioned for the first time the theme of 'birth' which will be so important throughout this Nativity play: we must anticipate at this point that the loveless Casandra will need to be reborn-into love. Later we will be enabled to contrast her words with those used by Isaiah of Mary (p. 71-2) : La madre de Dios sin par, / es de notar, / que humildosa ha de nacer. . . . antes santa / que engendrada, / preservada, / antes reina que nacida-Mary, in opposition to Casandra, was dedicated to humility not only since, but before her birth. Similarly, the culminating line of the vi- llancico which Casandra sings after Solomon has left her: que la flor yo me la so, with its boastful comparison of herself to the 'flower,' must be contrasted-and this has been pointed out by Mr. Hart-with the later allusions by the 'prophets' to Mary, the perfect flower, rose, or lily. And while the patriarchs confirm her beauty (they call her hermosa como las flores) they also recog- nize her arrogance (. .. saniosa como la mar). Illustrative of the comic vein in which Casandra's character is conceived is her dia- Here Cassandra, 'different from all other women,' is an unfeminine blue- stocking: as if to anticipate modern male prejudices, she is presented with eyes shining with intelligence, but with a complexion marred by freckles. Gil Vicente proceeds quite differently: his heroine is presented as a flower of feminine beauty and intelligence and Solomon as well as the patriarchs confirm her beauty. Only later in the play, when they are disappointed with her pride, mention is made of her learning (p. 70): que quien la viera sabida / y tan leida, / que se pudiera engafiar. 9 This anachronistic detail reminds us of the habit of medieval romances of presenting pagan and Jewish high-priests (the first in the Roman de Troie, the latter in the Spanish Libro de Alexandre, cf. M. R. Lida de Malkiel, BPh. X, 190) as 'bishops '-anachronisms that are not out of a place in a world oriented toward Christ, prophesying, requiring the advent of Christ.</page><page sequence="7">62 Leo Spitzer HR, XXVII (1959) tribe against marriage with its declamatory verve and its etymo- logical pun (mujer--moleja)l10-a passage, incidentally, that should not be exploited, as it was by unsensitive critics, mainly as a true testimony about contemporary marital mores. It mainly serves to make Casandra's precocious seriousness appear in comic light: while there is no doubt that her arguments against marriage are reminiscent of Stoic philosophy-as Casandra points out the absence in marriage of the ataraxia dear to this school of philosophy, finding therein only perturbationes (marriage, according to her, is sin con- cierto ni templanza, p. 54); she wishes to avoid entrar en pasiones, p. 56)-the very fact that a young girl who seems destined for 'normal' married life protests against marriage with arguments of a disenchanted Stoic philosopher produces a comic effect. Another comic feature is what I would call the 'negative cantiga de amado,' namely the villancico sung by her (Dicen que me case yo / no quiero marido, no): while in this genre of folk-songs the mother is usually invoked for furtherance or toleration of a love of the maiden, here Casandra addresses to her mother a plea against being forced to love; and comic are also some of her retorts to her suitor. Solomon in turn is far indeed from the Biblical figure of the king of wisdom: this carefree, narcissistic shepherd is a quite worldly lover, unsophisticatedly self-satisfied with his family background, his manners and his economic position (yo soy bien aparentado / y abastado / valiente zagal polido). His hasty 'let's come to the point' attitude would deserve a rebuke by any self-respecting girl. This naively rude Petruchio takes it for granted that the maiden will and must marry him-far be it from him that he should 'delay' an act that is already scheduled (pues te veo tan serena, / nuestra estrena [= happiness] / ya por mi no se detenga). Haste is his only advice: luego de aqui a tres dias / alegrias / ternds tu y yo tambie'n,'come come!' the refrain of his speeches: Anda, yen . Anda, si quieres venir. In the exchange of remarks: Solomon: No me ves? Casandra: Bien te veo Solomon: No te creo 10 This is an echo of one of Isidore 's Etymologiae (XI, 2, 17-19) which was upheld even by as serious a modern linguist as Walde: "Vir nuncupatus, quia maior in eo vis est quam in femina . . . Mulier vero a mollitie, tamquam detracta littera vel mutata, appellata est mulier. Utrique enim fortitudine et inbecillitate corporum separantur." Thus moleja in this passage must belong to Sp. muelle, not to molleja (Corominas, sub. vv.).</page><page sequence="8">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 63 I see, contrary to Mr. Hart, a comical echo of the previous words full of vanity whereby Solomon had recommended himself to Casandra: [the aunts had wished] Que me yeas / y me creas / para hecho de casar, suggesting that to see and to believe him should be enough for Casandra-now that non veni, visus sum, vici has materialized he shows his disappointment in the question No me ves? whereupon Casandra answers dryly: Bien te veo. But Solomon still persists in his vanity: No te creo 'I do not believe that you truly see me' (it being understood: 'if you did you would choose me'). But finally Solomon does understand and draws the correct conclusion: pues no quieres, to receive the blunt answer: No te quiero. All this is pure badinage without any mystic overtones. And the scene continues on a low level with Solomon's trivial suggestions that Casandra shuns marriage either because she wishes to sell herself (Quieres tit estar a cuenta?--a clear 'affront,' as Casandra calls it) or because she loves someone else. And finally when Solomon promises to shower her with 'flowers' (in the text: que te tengo en velloritas 'primroses or daisies,' v. Corominas's dictionary) provoking her rejection of such floritas (= 'flowers' and 'flowers of speech') we are on the level of the word-battles between Petruchio and Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew. Of the wise Solomon I can find in this scene only pale reflections: he is called 'intelligent' (cuerdo eres y sientes, p. 55) by Casandra who prides herself of the same gift and he himself emphasizes razdn (p. 53) and seso (p. 56), but cordura, raz6n, seso are not sabiduria; apart from the fact that his rationalism is quite egotistic and that Casandra, in the discussion of what 'common sense' in the matter of marriage is, wins a rhetorical triumph: he had said that 'it is common sense (seso) for married people not to be jealous,' she retorts: 'it is common sense (seso) not to marry in the first place.' As the reader knows, this comic figure called Solomon will at the end of the play resume the traditional solemn attitude of the Biblical Solomon. Why, we must ask, this double r51e? Gil Vicente obviously composed his play not according to the re- quirement of psychological consistency, but, as has been shown (by Levin Schiicking) for some of Shakespeare's plays, according to the logic of the different particular scenes: what was paramount for the playwright in our scene was to show a foolish Casandra declining a good marriage-the partner is here of importance only</page><page sequence="9">64 Leo Spitzer HR, XXVII (1959) insofar as he fits into the comic ambient. In this first part of the play he bears the name Solomon only because he is the sponsus of the Song of Songs. If he appears in our scene as the would-be bridegroom of Casandra he must fail in his pursuit because accord- ing to the medieval interpretation of the Song of Songs he was destined to be the bridegroom of Mary (who, in another play of Gil Vicente's, Auto pastoril castelhano, is called la zagala hermosa / que Salamon dice esposa, / cuando canticava della). Since his suitorship must fail how could he be a convincing suitor ? 11 Our impression of a 'scene-wise composition' is confirmed by the next episode in which the Sibyls, as yet scarcely aware of their historic r1le of Prophetesses and showing themselves more as good- hearted aunts anxious to carry out the marriage plans of a de- ceased mother, present Solomon's courtship to Casandra in the most favorable light from a worldly point of view: they insist on all his virtues and assets (including that of being a miisico) while Solomon continues in the comic vein, boasting about his riches in an enumeration (doomed to failure since Casandra had already refused to abandon her freedom even por sessenta / mil miliones de riqueza) of the items of his rural real estate: Tengo pomares y viiias y mil pinias / de rosas para holgares; / tengo villas y lugares / y mas treinta y dos gallinas. Those 32 hens appearing at the end of the list, "anticlimactically," as Mr. Hart has felt, have to my ear (which is not an allegorical one) a distinctly jocular ring.12 Solomon is here not yet an almighty king, but a small chicken farmer, proud of what he owns. This jocular tone is in contrast with Casandra's lines in the same scene: she speaks now on a higher level, manifesting for the 11 He is not even given by Gil Vicente the poetic gift of the Oriental sensuous-suprasensuous lover in that epithalamium that is the Song of Songs. The impartial critic must confess that our author has not succeeded in fusing the dogmatic and the artistic in the figure of Solomon. And he was also prevented from developing in the second part of the play the r1le of Solomon as a bridegroom of Mary: in the last scene (that of the Adoration) Solomon, like the other patriarchs, will address himself only to the Savior while it is the task of the Sibyls to praise his Mother. 12 The use of the small number in this passage is a wilful departure from Gil Vicente's customary 'numeric exuberance': it is in contrast with the sessenta mil millones de riqueza of which Casandra had spoken, and also with passages such as p. 68, [Mary appears] entre was de mil doncellas and p. 72, [Abraham speaking to Isaiah] Dos mil vcces lo decias.</page><page sequence="10">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 65 first time (after having, in the previous scene, declined marriage on philosophical grounds) her innermost feeling that she is singled out (escogida) for a more exalted destiny, 'another marriage' (otro casamiento),13 and for a more 'perfect life' to which alone her immaculate virginity might be sacrificed. I believe that the visionary, otherworldly seriousness of the lonely figure of the maiden, surrounded as she is by suitor and advisers speaking only in mundane terms and calling her 'insane' from their point of view, must be deeply moving in a stage performance. Casandra is motivated by an in itself noble aspiration toward superhuman perfection and it is a sign of Gil Vicente's greatness that he was able to envisage the ambivalence of such human striving, indeed the ambivalence of virginity (just as earlier, through Casandra's words, he had shown us the ambivalence of the sacramental institution of marriage). I suspect that the dramatist has deliberately in this part of the auto tipped the scales on her side and made her op- ponents appear so futile (Solomon egotistic, the Sibyls only family- minded) in order to impress on us the basic nobility of the being who has entered upon a path, to her the right road (que no vo camino errado), of error and blasphemy. And the note of seri- iousness, first struck in her words, will now dominate the action as the Jewish patriarchs Abraham, Moses and Isaiah are called upon to defend 'true prophecy.' At the beginning of this scene, however, the light note is not entirely missing, as if the comic vein had not yet spent its force. The entrance song echoes the tone of amorous popular poetry with its obviously traditional refrain Ay Dios, qui"n le hablaria! and its praise of Casandra's artless beauty rivalling with the roses and the sea, but deaf to the entreaties of those who would woo her. The fact, however, that in this lament phrases such as Ay Dios . . .or hermosa como las rosas, saiosa como la mar are twisted into a meaning quite different from that of a love song (the patriarchs wish to talk persuasively to the maiden about marriage; her saiia is not that of a coy mistress 13 Let us stress that Casandra does not mention here, nor will she later, the identity of her partner in the marriage, of the father of the God. In this she is different from such legendary figures as Semele whose hybris it is to wish to be able fully to identify the father of her child as the true Jupiter. Casandra's silence about her marriage partner also frees the poet from the difficult task of specifying in what form a marriage with the Holy Ghost would appear in Casandra's imagination.</page><page sequence="11">66 Leo Spitzer HR, XXVII (1959) but of a maiden that refuses to adopt the Jewish family policy of crescite et multiplicamini), that we hear not the voice of a young shepherd, but a chorus of venerable old sages who bend the words of traditional love poetry to other, to diplomatic purposes, cannot but produce a comic effect.14 What the patriarchs have found in order to predispose Casandra favorably for the envisaged marriage with Solomon is to bring her presents. Such generosity directed to a purpose is in line with their Oriental, their Jewish character. She is offered brace- lets, a ring and a chain-and Solomon offers bien se" qu6 'I know what' (and I think the reader does!). But when Casandra repeats before the patriarchs her firm intention not to marry, the vestiges of humor vanish as Moses hurls at her the word Blasfemas! which, I believe, marks the dividing line in the play between the comedy and the mystere: from now on the balance will be shifted entirely to the 'true prophets.' Moses, as the author of Genesis, will now present the whole Biblical story of the creation of the world which culminates in that of the first couple, colored anachronistically by the Christian conception of marriage as a 'sacrament,' indeed the first sacrament instituted by God, as a union in the flesh, symbolic of the union of man's soul with Christ, endowed with Christ's grace: ... le did compaijera. . / de una gracia ambos liados, / dos en una carne amados-in other words, we recognize here the com- bination of Genesis II, 24 with St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians V, 12-32, which has become the dogmatic basis for the Church's conception of the Christian marriage (cf. G. H. Joyce, The Chris- tian Marriage). And so far does the Moses of our play go in his 'retrospective interpretation' of Genesis that he imagines Sun and Moon at their creation to have been joined together in an, as it were, Christian marriage: compaiiero / por parcera / de una luz ambos guarnidos-notice the wording parallel to le di6 compaitera . . de una gracia ambos liados: Sun-and-Moon, an, as it were, cosmic couple, were united by divine light even as Adam and Eve were by divine grace, Light being a prefiguration of Grace. (How 14 It is probably no coincidence that Erutea's worldly-wise jocular re- mark: Muchas cosas hace el dar, / como contino se ve corresponds to Ovidian teachings such as auro conciliatur amor and that Casandra's reply: tengome de captivar / por el dar? / No me engaino yo ansi has a ring quite similar to the Cumaean Sibyl's statement in Metamorph. XIV, 134: praecorrumpere donis / me cupit [sc. Apollo].</page><page sequence="12">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 67 effortlessly Gil Vicente succeeds in combining scriptural reinterpre- tation with poetic effects!) To Moses' reproach that by rejecting marriage she counteracts the law imposed by God Casandra replies (as always in monotheistic terms, that is as a 'Christian Sibyl') that marriages made by God are good, but most marriages are made by the devil, whereupon Abraham proposes to her a good husband, comedido y nunca apasionado, thus bringing in the stoic ideal that Casandra herself had expressed in a previous scene and exposing himself to her sub- sequent objection that marriage without perturbatio is impossible: Como puede sin pasion / y alteracion / conservarse el casamiento? / Miidase el contentamiento ... / Solo Dios es perfeccion ... / que el hombre todo es mudable, y variable / por humana comprission [comprission = 'complexion, temperament, condition']. These are solemn, beautiful words, forever true, whosoever may utter them: Casandra is at the height of her exalted striving for superhuman perfection. But what should we say of the words that follow: Pero yo quiero decir / y descubrir / porque virgen quiero estar; / se que Dios ha de encarnar, / sin dudar: / y una virgen ha de parir. Is this only an objective prophecy of the birth of Christ, formulated in the words of Isaiah (VII, 14: ecce virgo concipiet, et pariet filium) ? Does she cling to virginity only because the excellence of this state will be proven by the fact that Christ will be born by a virgin, perhaps in a delicate wish to associate herself with that Virgin that will bear the divine child ? Or has the mad idea of herself as the mother of a god already crystallized to the point that she no longer associates, but identifies herself with the Virgin? 16 The reader must ask himself what psychological link exists between the lines referring to herself eso yo quiero decir ... porque virgen quiero estar and those about the birth of the Savior (se que Dios ha de encarnar). A first suspicion that the egotistic 15 But Casandra wilfully stops the 'quotation' of Isaiah there: the name of the Savior (et vocabitur nomen eius Emmanuel) will be identified (along with that of his mother as Mary) only later by Isaiah. 16 Mr. Hart has correctly remarked that Casandra in this scene does not yet outspokenly draw the consequence from her previous statements that since she should not marry a man she should instead become the "bride of one who is both God and man." This reticence is however somewhat counter- balanced, I believe, by the lines Pero yo quiero decir . . . and the ambiguity thus created tends to prolong the dramatic tension.</page><page sequence="13">68 Leo Spitzer HR, XXVII (1959) interpretation is the correct one is however not confirmed by the dramatis personae, for the Sibyls (who are perhaps more candid than we) immediately and enthusiastically corroborate Casandra's 'objective' prophecy with descriptive detail drawn from the Gospels. So engrossed are they in their business of prophesying the truth about the divine birth that they pay no attention to Casandra's private revelation Pero yo quiero decir / y descubrir. .... Begin- ning, each of them in a colloquial, self-assured tone appropriate rather to the professional prophets of the neighborhood (Erutea: Eso bien me lo se yo-y cierta s6 que . .-Cimeria: Yo dias ha 17 que hei soi?ado / y barruntado / que via. . . .-Peresica: Mi fe, dello se bien harto / y reharto que . . .), to continue with poetic expressions drawn from medieval hymns (including Latin phrases such as Mater Dei, gratia plena and a hymn within the hymn put in the mouth of angels: Rosa florida, / esclarecida, / madre de quien nos crid . . .), they carry sacred history forward, from the point where Moses' account had left it, up to the birth (and death) of Christ, thus preparing us for the last scene, that of the fulfilment of the prophecy in which we shall see Mary and Christ on stage. Among their heart-warming pictures of the birth of the dios humanado we find, for example, that of the Child at the breast of Mary, his happy sucking disturbed by the frightening dream of the Crucifixion, to be calmed by a mother who does not quite understand the reason of his fears."s This is the same baby that is earlier presented to us by the Sibyls, as calling "madre y madre a boca llena." These human features, so dear to popular devotion, seem also dear to the Sibyls who appear as sentient feminine beings and thus prepare us for the atmosphere of the Nativity scene. Casandra listens to the account of the Sibyls supposedly corroborating her own prophesy-and at its conclusion she bursts forth in words of 17 A remarkable example of Gil Vicente's poetic inventiveness: in this colloquial manner the Sibyl Cimeria suggests that her vision is of quite recent date. We are thus given to feel the suspense felt by the pre-Christian world at the approach of the Coming of Christ. 18 By this oral description Gil Vicente succeeds in including details of the Nativity scene which would, for reasons of dramatic cogency, be out of place in the final tableau vivant, e.g., the scene of the adoration of the Holy Family by the shepherds and the Magi. On the other hand, if we find certain details repeated in the two scenes (the singing of the angels, the unrest of the sleeping Christ-child) this must not strike us as duplication since emphasis is on the fulfilment of the prophecy in all its details.</page><page sequence="14">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 69 wild jealousy marking the acme of her hybris and announcing in ten terse lines (countering the 72 dedicated to the virgin) that it is she who will give birth to the god. Not only has the prophecy of the Sibyls failed to convince her of the true development, but they have provoked her to challenge the very possibility of Mary: Yo tengo en mi fantasia / y juraria / que de mi ha de nacer; / que obra de mi merecer / no puede haber, / en bondad ni hidalguia. Thus all the delicate human traits with which the Sibyls have adorned their account of Mary and Christ are lost upon their com- panion, fenced-in as she is in her inhuman fantasia,19 or monomania. But what will be the reaction of the Sibyls and the patriarchs to Casandra's blasphemous arrogance? Now it is for the latter to take the center of the stage as they comment with horror upon Casandra's outburst (their disapproval taking the form of a denial of the intelligence, seso, of which Casandra is so proud: desvaria, loca [perdida], respuesta fuera de conclusio'n, or of a reproach of breach of etiquette: alta descortesia, in opposition to Casandra's claim of hidalguia). In this scene Solomon undergoes his sudden transformation into the King of Wisdom. While his words are still the trivial ones of a disgusted lover (el diablo ha de acertar / a casar) suddenly he names himself, for the first time in the play, as Mr. Hart has pointed out, in a manner which contrasts his wisdom with Casandra's locura (tu loca, yo Salomon . . . /qud vida fuera la nuestra?) and which provokes her to even greater reliance on her personal gift of rationality, seso (Aun en mi seso est6 / que soy yo).20 Who changes is not Casandra who remains firm in her hybris, but Solomon who has suddenly grown before our eyes. It is not inconsistent with Gil Vicente's improvising technique and his dramaturgic nonchalance that at the moment that he no longer needs Solomon in the r61e of a suitor he is free 19 How should this word, so essential for the understanding of Casandra's character, be translated: 'thought' (as Braga interprets it), or 'imagination,' or perhaps ' whim, caprice' (which Italianate meaning is attested two decades later in Juan de Vald"s' Dialogo de la lengua, v. Corominas) T I would be inclined to suggest a meaning somewhat between 1) and 2): 'personal think- ing.' Surely Casandra wishes here to contrast her individual mind with that of the other Sibyls. [See also Joseph E. Gillet's article on "Spanish fantasia for presunci6sn," listed on p. 23. Eds.] 20 A sentence which, in spite of its apparent similarity to the cogito ergo sum, must perhaps be intended to mean that as long as Casandra is not 'out of her mind' she is her true self, that rationality is the substance of her life.</page><page sequence="15">70 Leo Spitzer HR, XXVII (1959) to transform him into a prophet of Christ among other prophets: Moses tells him: Y ti~ tambien, Salom6n, / buen gargon, / los can- tares que hacias / todos eran profecias. The Old Testamentary prophets-even in their solemn moments a certain (reverent) humor of Gil Vicente's is not missing-appear on a level of contemporaneity and personal intimacy, the pre-Chris- tian era, as we have said, having shrunk in time and space: Abra- ham has 'heard' Isaiah prophecy Christo dos mil veces and Moses speaks of the prophecies of the "bon garcon" Solomon in the past (los cantares que hacias). In this gathering, which is somehow anachronistically suggestive of a meeting of the PEN-club, all members show themselves to be conversant with the writings of each other and not forgetful of their own: Moses quotes, as we have seen, Solomon's Song of Songs. Isaiah points first disingenuously to a certain prophecy in the impersonal form in desta madre es- cogida / otra cosa se escribid, only later to reveal it as his own (como yo decia), altering, it is true, the text of the book Isaiah by adding the name of Mary (which appears here for the first time in the play) to the name actually appearing in that Biblical Book, Emmanuel, and also a description of Mary's humility as opposed to Casandra's arrogance, thus rounding out, in true Realprophetie fashion, the Old Testamentary text with the New Testamentary explanations (whereas Casandra, no member of the 'club,' had relied only on her fantasia in explaining the text of Isaiah). Abraham, otherwise not known himself as a Biblical author,21 alludes to the Bible as the books of the Divine Writer (cuanto desta cosa esti escrito / ... tudo fue profetizado / por mandado / daquel hacedor del mundo). Abraham is referring here to the Last Judg- ment as included in divine foreknowledge, but this he does not prophesy himself. Since it is the prerogative of the Sibyls to prophesy, rather than to comment on prophecy, and since precisely to them prophecy about the Last Judgment was assigned in patristic literature (see Dona Carolina, p. 350), this part of the future of mankind will be announced by the Erythrean Sibyl who is said 21 Abraham is facetiously characterized as the oldest of the group by his oath: y aun te juro a mi corona, ahotas que no mentias. The word ahotas belongs to the traditional jargon of the shepherds in popular plays and corona must mean 'bald head' (as Enzio di Poppa Volture translates): Abraham, 'the father of all believers,' has, according to the Bible, reached the age of 175 years.</page><page sequence="16">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 71 to have written (escriviste y declaraste) all that is necessary for man to know about it (including the seiiales of the approaching Last Judgment, i.e. the quindecim signa ante judicium, v. Dona Carolina). The liber scriptus . . . in quo totum continetur unde mundus judicetur, as the Dies irae has it, could then not be placed in better hands. Mr. Hart has pointed out that the prophecy of the Last Judgment, dwelling as it does on the sin of pride (pre- suncidn) which will bring about the destruction of the world, is meant also to allude to Casandra whose sin is presunci6n. It is a high achievement of artistry on the part of Gil Vicente that he offers us the terrifying picture of the annihilation of mankind (ha de ser todo abrasado-like Sodom and Gomorrha) just before the scene of the Adoration which opens with the idyllic peaceful accents of the lullaby Ro ro ro sung by the Angels: first we are forced to visualize the all-destructive consequences of hybris, then we are consoled by the perspective of salvation whose effect will be felt on all humanity including the obstinate sinner Casandra. And now comes the final scene toward which the previous scenes had been pointing with ever growing dramatic intensity. It is a great operatic scene, a Gesamtkunstwerk appealing to the different senses in which poetry, music (the singing first of the angels, then of the patriarchs), the plastic arts (the tableau vivant of Mary feeding the child in the manger, both remaining silent) and dance (the final terreiro) participate in order to celebrate the joy of a world to whom the Savior has come, the joyful harmony that can fitly be represented only in a display of all the arts in which musical harmony takes the lead. After the angels have sung their lullaby the patriarchs and the Sibyls alternatively, forming a group around the manger and singing em chacota (= a lively song, cf. Corominas), announce each in his or her way that our Lord has been born and pay homage (the term adoro being repeated) to the Savior: f. inst. Abraham will address himself to the God of sacrifice (we remember that Abraham himself was ready to sacrifice Isaac, that figura Christi, to God), Moses to his brother in the human flesh, Solomon to the divine King; Isaiah, the greatest of Old Testamentary prophets, will bow to Christ, the fulfilment of all prophecy. Touched by the evidence of what she has seen, Casandra, for whom all this concert of divine harmony and todo aparato do Nascimento, as the stage-</page><page sequence="17">72 Leo Spitzer HR, XXVII (1959) direction says, has been staged-and the spectator of this scene will feel his own 'joy of seeing' enhanced by the effect on Casandra of this sight-confesses her sins: she has never acted harmoniously, according to the order of things (nunca di pasada concertada-the last word being full of 'musical' meaning, cf. Traditio III), she has lost her earthly life and it would have been better if she never had been born. . This reference to her lost life and useless birth must be considered together with her earlier pronouncement: Si yo me casara aora, / no queria ser nacida. / No tengo mas de una vida. Then she would have wished not to have been born if she had undergone the Christian marriage duties, then she would have thought her life to be wasted on such a preposterous enterprise- now she recognizes that this one life was made futile by her hybris (her words have a Calderonian ring: el mayor delito es haber nacido). And the theme of the futile, useless birth must also be connected with Christ's birth necessary to humanity (un solo Dios nacido por nos salvar, as Isaiah had said). The words of repentance she speaks will therefore not be addressed to the Savior of mankind, but to the intercessor Mary por vuestros siete placeres-one of the most delicate lines in our inexpressibly graceful poetic drama: Casandra, the lost being that will give birth neither to a god nor a man, in her deep grief hails, not the Virgin of the seven griefs, but la virgen que pari6 sin dolores. It is particularly moving that while the patriarchs payed homage to Christ Casandra humbles herself before her divine counterpart, praising Mary as corona de las mujeres, as the woman blessed among women, and giving thereby the cue to the other Sibyls who now will raise their voice in praise of the Virgin.22 In this operatic scene where Renaissance cathol- 22 1 may be allowed to discuss here the passage (p. 80) : planeta de nostra gloria / influencia de vitoria: / por memoria / nuestro sino laureolo. I cannot agree to Aubrey Bell's proposal (Estudos vicentinos, p. 161) to connect the phrase sino laureolo with a passage in Gil Vicente's Comedia de Rubena: / Dadme la mano, seniora, / por mi esposa y laureola and, ultimately, with the name of the heroine in the Cdrcel de amor. What would sino laureolo mean ? 'sign, destiny of Laureola'? I would tentatively propose to read (sino) aureolo (the -1- would have been prompted by folk-etymological identification [in the printer's or the poet's mind] of aureolo with laurel, suggested by vitoria) and to interpret it as synonymous with aureola. This Spanish word, attested in the 15th cent. (v. Corominas) and even before in a medieval text, the Victorial, in the phrase corona aureola applied to the Jewish Tabernacle (v. M. R. Lida de Malkiel, Rom. Phil. XI, 193), goes back to the Biblical</page><page sequence="18">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 73 icism shines in its most colorful joyfulness we must imagine Christ and Mary in their glory enthroned in the center of the stage, flanked by two choruses, one of male, one of female prophets, who celebrate with equal ardor the joy of Salvation. The play is brought to an end with dancing and song. The dancers form three groups (isto bailado de terreiro de tres por tres), obviously the Patriarchs, the Sibyls, and the third group made up of Solomon, Casandra (who now cannot be excluded from the celebration of joy) and the author (who has mentioned himself before as the composer of the song).23 The song, a villancico, must be considered together with the other villancico (also danced, folia) which was sung in the beginning of the play by the patriarchs: Que san-osa estd la nina. Once more, and for the last time, will the contrast be drawn between the two maidens, lta nia Casandra and la doncella Maria; once more Mary triumphs: Casandra was hermosa como las flores, but also saniosa como la mar, Mary is only graciosa y bella. The emphasis in this poem a lo divino which Latin expression corona aureola as attested in Exodus XXV where the table of the Tabernacle is described: the passage in question reads in English translation: (v. 24) And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, make thereto a crown of gold round about (v. 25) And thou shalt make unto it a border of a hand-breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the boarder thereof round about. The expressions used in Latin are in v. 24 corona aurea and in v. 25 corona aureola. This lexicological difference was, in patristic literature from the Venerable Bede to Thomas Aquinas, interpreted allegorically as meaning a difference of heavenly rewards: the corona aurea would be given to the souls of those who in their life-time have fulfilled the normal Christian duties, the corona aureola is, in Thomas' words, privilegiatum praemium privilegiatae victoriae respondens. There exist three classes of such privileged souls, the first being the virgins (cf. Dict. de thdologie catholique, 1913, s.v. aureole). In our passage, the Virgin has won such a privilegiata victoria (she is an influencia de vitoria / por memoria). As to sino (which at the time of Gil Vicente was not yet differentiated from signo, v. Corominas, s.v. sei~a), it may reflect the prophecy of Isaiah (Propter hoc dabit Dominus ipse vobis signum. Ecce virgo concipiet . . .) and mean 'sign,' or else be a synonym of corona meaning 'halo.' 23 "Der auctor war ... die Seele der Auffiihrungen, Festordner, Regisseur und selber actor. Meist iibernahm Gil Vicente die Rolle des Prdlogo, oder des Argumentador, und blieb als solcher stiindig auf der Biihne, " Carolina Michailis de Vasconcellos, Gr6bers Grundriss, II, 2, p. 282.</page><page sequence="19">74 Leo Spitzer HR, XXVII (1959) could as well be a folk-song addressed to an earthly maiden is entirely on Mary's physical beauty: one of the Sibyls, in lines immediately preceding our song, had hinted at the spiritual reason for the increase in Mary's physical beauty: the 'white rose' that she was acquired an even more delicate color (color mds fina)-we would be tempted to say: a Botticellian otherworldly sublimity. In the villancico the praise of Mary's beauty will be presented, as is characteristic of folk-songs, in quantitative terms ('nothing is more beautiful than Mary') and in a numeric pattern. The fact that there are three groups that dance it has suggested other triads in the poem: it has three stanzas each addressed to a representative of the three poetic professions (mariners, knights, shepherds), each one of these being called upon to testify to Mary's superiority by comparing the beauty of three basic elements of his life (nave- vela-estrella.; caballo-armas--guerra; ganado--valles--sierra) with that of the Virgin. Thus the villancico is indirectly an homage paid to her by the beautiful things of the earth. Of the three pro- fessions the first has been obviously suggested to the poet by the conception of Mary as stella maris (she is mentioned in the preced- ing speeches of the Sibyls as stella matutina), the second by that of her as a warrior against Lucifer (mentioned before by a Sibyl) and the third by the motif (also mentioned before) of the shepherds to whom the Nativity was first revealed. It is the stanza devoted to the shepherds (with its typical 'idyllic diminutives' pastorcico, ganadico) which must necessarily come last since we must be re- minded at the end 24 of the pastoral setting which was indicated to us from the start of the play ("Cassandra em figura de Pastora"). And now we are able to answer Ticknor's objection to our play as "a strange union of the spirit of an ancient mystery and of a modern vaudeville." Provided that we replace this last term, which has semantically deteriorated in our days, by a nobler term such as 'light opera' or Singspiel, we must acknowledge that Tick- nor was right in his definition, if not-as Dona Carolina saw-in 24 Siding with Menendez y Pelayo and other critics, I consider our song as the true end of the play in which all the actors on stage (including the author) dance a final round, the 'fare-well villancico' A la guerra, caballeros esforzados, as a poesie de circonstance reflecting contemporary patriotic sentiment (cf. parallel final lines of the Tragicomedia Exhorta5do da Guerra: Avante, avante, Senhores, / poisque com grandes favores / todo o c6u vos favorece), comparable to the playing of the national anthem at the end of a dramatic performance in war time.</page><page sequence="20">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 75 his appraisal of the play. To apply to it the label "incongruous" is to forget that in Renaissance catholicism sensuous delight that appeals to the eye and the ear is not incompatible with the firmest of dogmatic convictions. Nor are the accents of secular folk-poetry out of place in a mystere-however much theologically conceived- whose author has endeavored to make dogmatic truths accessible to the popular mind. For his was a time when the rift, which we today take for granted, between the man of learning and the man of the people had not yet developed (one may compare other figures of the first half of the 16th century such as Luther and Rabelais who, in their quite different work, also represent a syn- thesis of learning and folk-ways) and when the distance between the supernal powers and the believer was shorter than in our time: the divine could be shown as immanent or latent in the most trifling human affairs: in our play there exists then no "hodgepodge" of secular and religious motifs, but a natural growth of the latter out of the former (the solemn mystere develops out of an unassum- ing pastoral comedy). The fact that some of the most beautiful examples of popular Spanish lyricism occur in our religious play shows the deep connection which the poet felt between the world of sensuous beauty and religious truth. In addition to the blending of dramatic genres and of the different arts we witness in our play also the blending of representatives of the most different civiliza- tions (Judaism and Heathendom united in the acceptance of Christianity). The Auto da Sibila Casandra, an act of faith made visible on the stage, is what Gundolf has called, in reference to certain Shakespearean plays, a Weltfeier, a celebration in which the whole historical world takes part. The Johns Hopkins University LEO SPITZER Post-script 1) After Dona Carolina the Dutch scholar Mia J. Gerhardt in her book "La pastorale" (1950, pp. 141 ff.) insisted on the unity of our play which obtains in spite, or rather because, of its comic features: Le dialogue, alerte et amusant, est d'une homeliness qui ne frise jamais la platitude; il prate aux jeux de la scene par la fagon dont les tantes et Salomon, exc6d's, finissent par parler de Cassandre comme si elle n'6tait pas 1. ....

Mais ce qui est le plus admirable, c'est que Gil Vicente ne perd jamais de vue le sujet veritable de sa piece, qui en est la raison d'etre et qui determine en meme temps l'intrigue, parce qu'il est a la base du refus de Cassandre. Les allusions qu'elle fait a son 6tat de grace, au mariage tout autre qu'elle contemple, a la destin&amp;e plus haute qui l'attend, preparent la revelation finale de ce mystire qu'elle prevoit en prophetesse, et applique a elle-meme en femme. Cette revelation pro- voque un revirement de toute la piece: la naissance du Christ passe au premier plan, et le ton s'eleve au sublime des propheties et de la poesie biblique. Mais il n'y a aucun disparate entre le comique de l'entr6e en matiere et la grandeur de la conclusion. . . . [In the scene of Solomon Miss Gerhardt finds] quelques allusions d'une telle desinvolture qu'on se demande s'il ne s'y cache pas une pointe d'ironie. On ne saurait de demeler. . . . La realith villageoise, a peine stylisee, a peine embellie [the author is obviously thinking of details such as the 32 hens], et le grand drame sacre que raconte la Bible s'unissent, se fondent ici en une parfaite harmonie de tous leurs elements en apparence si disparates. To these sensitive remarks I may add that what Miss Gerhardt calls the "homely" and I would call the "gemiitlich" details of family life found in our play are dogmatically justified by a basic character of the Christian religion: the God revealed by Christ is not only the World-Ruler or Heavenly King of other religions, but the Loving Father and the atmosphere of the human family pervades the Christian heaven even as the heavenly family is reflected in any human family. Casandra has denied first the human, then the divine family: she is shown first in opposition to all the sweetness, simplicity and "Gemiitlichkeit" of the former to be allowed in the end to experience the both human and super- human harmony of the latter. As to the mixture of buffoonery and solemnity in religious drama in general, Roman Jakobson (in Studia philologica et litteraria, Bern, Francke, 1958) treating a Czech "Medieval Mock Mystery" of the 14th cent., writes: "Faith in the Eucharist, the Nativity and the Resurrection was too powerful to be shaken by parody. . . . Ludicrous symbols prefigure solemn events. The compenetration of impetuous buffoonery and exalted mystery puzzled and repelled scholars of Victorian spirit when dealing with Medieval drama." (Are contemporary attempts at allegoriz- ing the comic passages in religious drama a survival, or a revival, of that Victorian misunderstanding?)</page><page sequence="22">"Auto da Sibila Casandra" 77 2) The idea, proposed by Dona Carolina which I first accepted (see above pp. 58) that Gil Vicente was the inventor of the motif of Casandra prophesying pro domo sua can unfortunately no longer be upheld entirely. In his book Venus and die missver- standene Dido (Hamburg, 1955) Walter Pabst (without men- tioning Gil Vicente's auto) points to a passage from an incana- bulum, inspected by him, containing the story of Guerino il Meschino by Andrea de' Magnabotti di Barberino (1370-1431) and quotes the following lines about the Sibyl condemned to live in a grotto because of her false prophecy: "o io udito dire che ze la sauia sibilla la quale si e vergine in lo mondo che ela credeua che dio scendesse in lei quando incarno in Maria virgine E per questo lei despero E fo ziudicata per questa caxone in queste montagne." Later Guerino will ask the sapientissima Sibilla why, having been singled out by Providence as teacher of Mary (maestra di guela verzene in cui incarno il Salvatore de la humana natura) she came to lose her wisdom (seno) and her trust in divine help (perche te desperati de la divinita). Professor Pabst explains convincingly the motif of the Sibyl's attempt to rival with Mary by a contaminatio: the ambitious Sibyl of the Metamorphoses who refused to the god the consummation of love came to be fused with the prophetess of Christ (in the traditional interpretation of Virgil's 4th Eclogue) : "So wurde aus der die Gottesmutterschaft der Jungfrau Vorauswissenden eine eifersiichtige Rivalin der Muttergottes." Thus already the 14th century Italian compilator of 'Guerino il Meschino' presented the dramatic motif basic to Gil Vicente's play who in turn may have identified the Sibyl with the Trojan prophetess Cassandra. Antecedents can also be found for the coupling of the two figures Solomon and the Sibyl. F. Neri (Studi medievali IV 1912/3), pp. 214 ff., points to the presence of this motif in Sicilian popular legends: "si vantano le sue [the Sibyl's] doti d'acutezza, riassunte in detti e consigli oscuri, sibillini, ma savi, onde si raccosta al tipo delle leggende salomoniche, e del re sapiente viene fatto persin sorella" (partly by confusion with the Queen of Sheba). In this manner we may explain why the Sibyl became, with Andrea di Barberino (see above), 'the teacher of Mary': the learned Sibyl had read in the Old Testament the prophecy which Mary was called upon to enact.</page></plain_text>
