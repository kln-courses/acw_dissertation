ABSTRACT BIOSID is a Biofidelic Side Impact Dummy of the fiftieth percentile adult male that was developed in 1989 under the direction of the SAE Side Impact Dummy Task Force. This paper provides descriptions of the following items: i) two modifications that have been made to improve its durability and usability, ii) impact response verification requirements, iii) repeatability and reproducibility data, and iv) biofidel- ity and instrumentation ratings. BIOSID WAS DEVELOPED because the International Standards Organization (ISO) concluded in 1988 that neither SID (1, 2, 3)* nor EUROSID (4, 5) had suffi- cient impact biofidelity to be used to assess side impact protection (6, 7, 8). In response to this conclusion, a Side Impact Dummy Task Force was formed by the Mechanical Human Simulation Subcom- mittee of the SAE Human Biomechanics and Simula- tion Standards Committee. The result of the task force efforts was BIOSID. A detailed description of BIOSID components and comparisons of its impact responses to biofidelity requirements defined by ISO are given in a paper by Beebe (9). Since publication of Beebe's paper, two design modifications have been made to improve its durability and usability without changing its impact response characteristics. In addition, impact response calibration requirements have been specified by the SAE Dummy Testing Equipment Subcommittee. Data have been collected that can be used to assess the degree of repeatability and reproducibility of its impact response. Ratings have been assigned to its overall impact biofidelity and its ability to make mea- surements of responses which are important to assess side impact protection by Working Group 5 of ISO/TC22/SC12. The following are discussions of these items. DESIGN MODIFICATIONS PELVIS COVERING - The pelvis structure of the BIOSID is covered by a removable pelvis flesh which is comprised of a vinyl skin with a foam interior. Upon removal of the covering post test, tearing of the internal vinyl skin where it contacts shape radius corners of the pelvis structure has been noted (See Figure 1). This tearing, while aesthetically displeasing, has no influence on the pelvis impact response which is controlled by a replaceable foam plug. To reduce the tendency for tearing, the pelvic bone's sharp corners have been given a more generous radius on all metal corners. The corresponding vinyl corners were also given larger radii. The exposed foam area of the pelvic flesh has been enclosed by adding a wall of vinyl. In addition, the front and back zipper design has been changed to a one zipper design with the front abdo- men section made into a hinge (See Figure 2). These modifications should improve the durability of the pelvis flesh covering while having no effect on its impact response characteristics.

With the first design, the hook consisted of the hook assembly, a string pot barrel keeper, a spacer, two #4-40 mounting screws with nuts, and a longer bib mounting screw to hold the keeper in place against the string-pot-barrel (See Figure 3). Over tightening of the bib mounting bolt could cause an over stressed condition of the keeper against the barrel and the #4-40 screws. This could pull the threads out of the nuts of the mounting bolts and cause a bending of the hook. To eliminate these conditions, the bracket was redesigned. The bracket is now a one piece unit which contains two set screws to hold the potentiometer cylinder in place and has two keen inserts to replace the screw-nut combination of the mounting screws of the first design (See Figure 4). Again, this modification eliminates a user problem without changing the impact response characteristics.

These test conditions were defined by the SAE Dummy Testing Equipment Sub- committee and make use of existing dummy test lab equipment. The following are brief descriptions of the tests. The corresponding impact response require- ments are given in Appendix A for the head and neck and Appendix B for the other Ave test conditions. HEAD DROP TEST - The head is dropped from 200 mm onto a flat, steel plate. In its suspended position, the head is oriented such that its midsagittal plane makes a 35 degree angle with respect to the impact surface and its anterior-posterior axis is hori- zontal. A response requirement is placed on the mag- nitude of the peak resultant acceleration of the center of gravity of the head. NECK PENDULUM TEST - This test procedure is similar to the Hybrid III neck test except the entire head and neck assembly is rotated 90 degrees when attached to the neck pendulum. The pendulum impact velocity is to be between 6.89 and 7.13 m/s. Require- ments are placed on the change in velocity of the pendulum during deceleration, neck moment measured at the occipital condyles, head rotation relative to the pendulum and the phasing between peak moment and peak head rotation. Note that the pendulum decelera- tion pulse is characterized by its change in velocity, a very repeatable parameter, rather than pendulum decel- eration which has proven to be a highly erratic param- eter in Hybrid III neck testing. SHOULDER IMPACT TEST - This test is con- ducted using the 23.4 kg impactor used for the Hybrid III thorax test. The dummy is seated upright on a flat surface. Its torso jacket is removed and its arm is horizontal. The impactor is aligned so that its bot- tom edge is at the level of the bottom edge of the 490</page><page sequence="3">arm. The shoulder is to be impacted at a velocity of 4.41 to 4.59 m/s. Requirements are placed on the impact velocity, impact force and shoulder rib deflec- tion. THORACIC IMPACT THROUGH ARM - This test is conducted with the dummy seated upright on a flat surface with its torso jacket off. The arm is positioned down with the lowest point on the inside surface of the arm spaced between 3.2 and 6.4 mm from the thorax rib padding. This spacing is critical for achieving the required level of peak rib accelera- tion. The arm is impacted with the 23.4 kg Hybrid III thoracic impactor at the level of the second BIOSID rib. The arm is to be impacted at a velocity of 6.57 to 6.84 m/s. Requirements are placed on peak probe force; peak upper, mid and lower thoracic rib accelera- tions and deflections; peak upper and lower torso spine box accelerations; and peak shoulder deflection. THORACIC IMPACT WITH ARM REMOVED - This test is conducted with the arm and torso jacket removed. The dummy is seated upright on a flat surface and struck at the level of its second rib with the 23.4 kg thoracic impactor. The thorax is to be impacted at a velocity of 6.57 to 6.84 m/s. Require- ments are placed on peak probe force; peak upper, mid and lower thoracic rib accelerations and deflections; and peak upper and lower torso spine box accelera- tions. ABDOMINAL IMPACT TEST - For this test the dummy is seated upright on a flat surface with its jacket off and arm horizontal. In order to impact only the two abdominal ribs, a 76 mm diameter wooden block that is 76 mm long and has a mass of 225 g is attached to the impact surface of the 23.4 kg thoracic impactor. The impact is centered on the lower two ribs of BIOSID. The abdomen is to be impacted at a velocity of 4.41 to 4.59 m/s. Require- ments are placed on peak probe force, peak upper and lower abdominal rib accelerations and deflections, and peak upper and lower torso spine box accelerations. PELVIS IMPACT TEST - The dummy is seated upright on a flat surface with its torso jacket removed and arm down. Impact is to be square to the H-point plug using the 23.4 kg impactor. Make sure that a new H-point plug is installed prior to testing. The pelvis is to be impacted at a velocity of 6.57 to 6.84 m/s. Requirements are placed on peak probe impact force and peak lateral pelvis acceleration. No requirements are placed on pubic symphysis load or sacrum load since these are optional transducers. Also, no requirement is placed on the ilium load since the impact is not aligned with this transducer. Since the pelvis plug is permanently deformed during testing and must be replaced after each test, a method to verify the response characteristics of the foam sheet from which plugs are taken was deemed desir- able. The procedure is to select one foam plug from a group of plugs cut from the same foam sheet. A load-deflection test is conducted at 6.3 mm/s with the ends of the plug loaded by flat plates that completely cover the end surfaces. For plugs cut from the sheet to be acceptable, the load at 5 percent deformation must lie between 9.6 N and 10.5 N. In addition, the requirements for the pelvis impact test must be met when a second plug cut from the same sheet is used. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS - BIOSID uses the Hybrid III head and neck. The manufacturing processes for these components are well controlled. For this reason, the verification requirements given in Appendix A for the head and neck were based on the results of limited testing of existing Hybrid III head and neck components which demonstrate acceptable repeatability and reproducibility in frontal response verification tests. The other five test conditions involve newly devel- oped structures where the manufacturing processes had not been fully defined. Preliminary impact response requirements were specified for each of these five test conditions based on response data obtained from the first four BIOSID dummies. Controls were then placed on various manufacturing processes to ensure that the average responses of each of the next eight dummies manufactured were within ±10 percent of the average responses of the first four BIOSID dummies. Then averages of the average responses of the 12 dummies were calculated and used to define the midpoint of the verification corridors. The width of the corridors were based on the range of responses for the 12 dummies (Appendix B). BIOSID USER'S MANUAL - The SAE Dummy Equipment Testing Subcommittee is preparing a BIO- SID User's Manual which will given rigorous descrip- tions of each verification test condition and corre- sponding response verification requirements. Assem- bly and disassembly instructions will also be given in the manual. Each BIOSID that is delivered will have a data sheet comparing that dummy's responses to the verification corridors. IMPACT RESPONSE REPEATABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY SLED TEST RESULTS - The Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted a series of 32.2 km/h padded wall, lateral impact sled tests using two BIOSID dummies (10). Two paddings were used, Ethafoam LC200 (30.4 g/1 and 100 kPa crush strength) and ARCEL 512 (40.5 g/1 and 320 kPa crush strength). Six tests per padding condition were conducted with one of the dummies and 5 tests per padding configuration were conducted with the other dummy giving a total of 22 tests. For each dummy and padding configuration, coefficients of 491</page><page sequence="4">variation (C.V.) were calculated for peak thoracic rib accelerations and deflections, peak upper and lower spine box acceleration, and peak pelvic accelerations (See Table 1). The C.V.s for peak thoracic rib deflec- tion and peak pelvic acceleration were all less than 5 percent. The largest C.V.s occurred for peak thoracic rib accelerations which ranged from 3.1 percent to 7.8 percent which is quite acceptable. Test results of the two dummies for the same response measurement and padding were combined and coefficients of variations were calculated (See Table 1). Excellent reproducibility occurred for peak thoracic rib deflections, peak spine box accelerations and peak pelvic acceleration since the combined C.V.s were all less than 5 percent. Peak thoracic rib accelerations were more variable with combined C.V.s ranging from 3.1 to 11.1 percent. Overall, the two dummies showed excellent repeatabil- ity and reproducibility in these tests. The only excep- tion was the peak thoracic rib accelerations which demonstrated larger, but acceptable, variations. RESPONSE VERIFICATION TEST RESULTS - A single BIOSID dummy that had been previously used in full scale and sled test programs was subjected to 2 sets of 10 consecutive 6.7 m/s pendulum impacts to the thorax, 10 impacts with the arm down and 10 impacts with the arm removed (11). The tests were conducted according to Impact Response Verification Procedures described previously. Prior to each test series, new foam was applied to the thoracic rib area. The coefficients of variations of each of the response measurements for each of the test conditions are given in Table 2. The repeatability of all responses, except the peak shoulder deflection, were outstanding with C.V.s ranging from 0.4 percent to 3.5 percent. Peak shoulder deflection had a slightly larger, but quite acceptable, C.V. of 5.1 percent. The reproducibility of the dummies can be assessed by the C.V.s of the average responses of 12 dummies given in Appendix B for the various verification tests. Except for the peak shoulder deflection for the tho- racic impact through the arm, these C.V.s were quite good ranging from 2.3 percent to 8.8 percent. Prak shoulder deflection showed the greatest variation among the 12 dummies with a C.V. of 14.4 percent. This measurement was also the most variable for the repeatability tests discussed previously with a C.V. of 5.1 percent (Table 2).

ISO has specified a set of test conditions and response corri- dors for assessing the lateral impact biofidelities of the head, neck, thorax, shoulder, abdomen and pelvis (15-20). The following weighting scheme was adopted by WG5 to quantify how well each dummy response meets its biofidelity requirement. If a given response lies within its biofidelity corridor, it is classified as "A". If the response measurement lies outside the corridor, but within one corridor width of the boundary, it is classified as "B". If the response does not meet either of these two defini- tions, it is classified as "C". The classifications "A", "B", "C" were assigned weighting values of 10, 5 and 0, respectively. In addition, WG5 assigned weighting factors ranging from 0 to 10 to each dummy response that was to be measured and to each test condition defined for a given body region. A scheme was developed to combine these weighted values to give biofidelity ratings, ranging from 0 to 10, for each of the six body regions. Weighting factors were then assigned to each body region and a scheme was developed to calculate a single, weighted biofidelity value, ranging from 0 to 10, for the dummy. WG5 also has proposed the following grading system for classifying the overall biofidelity value (21). Excellent &gt; 8.6 to 10 Good &gt; 6.5 to 8.6 Fair &gt; 4.4 to 6.5 Marginal &gt; 2.6 to 4.4 Unacceptable 0 to 2.6 WG5 further notes that for a dummy to be acceptable to all the delegations, its biofidelity value would have to be greater than 4. Mertz and Irwin (22) have evaluated BIOSID test results (9, 23) according to the WG5 scheme. Using the latest biofidelity test conditions and requirements agreed to by WG5 (See Biofidelity Requirements - Set No. 2 of Reference 22), they calculated the following biofidelity values for BIOSID. Rating Biofidelity Classification Head 6.7 Good Neck 6. 1 Fair Shoulder 5.2 Fair Thorax 7.6 Good Abdomen 5.6 Fair Pelvis 5.1 Fair Overall 5.9 Fair RATING OF MEASUREMENT CAPACITY An important consideration in selecting a dummy for use in side impact collision protection assessment is the capacity of the dummy to provide measurements that can be used to assess protection. ISO/TC22/SC12/WG6 identified and prioritized a number of dummy responses that could be measured. Values from 0 to 10 were assigned on a consensus basis to each measurement with 0 being not important and 10 being very important. Working Group 5 developed a scheme (25) for calculating a single, weighted measurement capacity value using the priority listing of WG6. An overall measurement capacity rating value of zero would mean that the dummy is not instrumented to make any measurements that are 493</page><page sequence="6">important and a value of 10 would mean that it is instrumented to measure all values that have impor- tance. Using this scheme BIOSID had a value of 7.5. It was this measurement capacity rating along with the BIOSID biofidelity ratings and repeatability and repro- ducibility data discussed previously that led to the WG5 resolution which stated that BIOSID is an acceptable dummy to be specified in the ISO full scale side impact test procedure (24). SUMMARY Recently, two design modifications were made to BIOSID to improve its durability and usability. The pelvis covering has been redesigned to reduce internal tearing and the double zipper has been replaced by a single zipper. The rib accelerometer mount and string- pot-end keeper bracket have been redesigned so that the clamping force on the string-pot-end cylinder does not prestress the rib attachment screws. Neither modification had any effect on the impact response of BIOSID. Impact response verification test procedures and requirements are given. These were developed by the SAE Dummy Test Equipment Subcommittee and all BIOSIDs are designed to meet these requirements. Data demonstrating BIOSIDs excellent impact response repeatability and reproducibility were presented. Biofidelity and response measurement capacity rating schemes developed by Working Group 5 of ISO/TC22/SC12 were presented. BIOSID had fair biofidelity (5.9 out of 10) and good measurement capacity (7.5 out of 10). These results of repeatabil- ity, reproducibility, biofidelity and measurement capac- ity were the bases for the WG5 resolution of accept- ing BIOSID as a dummy to be used in the ISO full scale side impact test procedure.

APPENDIX A IMPACT RESPONSE VERIFICATION REQUIRE- MENTS FOR THE HEAD AND NECK - The BIOSID uses the head and neck of the Hybrid III dummy. The manufacturing processes for these com- ponents are well controlled. For this reason, impact response verification requirements were specified on existing components which were available for use in the Hybrid III. The following are the lateral impact response verification requirements for the head and neck. HEAD DROP TEST REQUIREMENTS - When the head is dropped in accordance with the test proce- dure described in the body of the paper, the following requirements are to be met: 1. The resultant acceleration of the center of gravity of the head shall be between 120 and 150 G. 2. The resultant acceleration-time curve shall be uni- modal such that no oscillation after the main accel- eration peak shall exceed 15% of the peak result- ant acceleration. . 3. The longitudinal acceleration component (x-direc- tion) shall not exceed 15 G. NECK PENDULUM TEST REQUIREMENTS - When the neck is tested in accordance with the test procedure described in the body of the paper, the following requirements are to be met. 1. The pendulum deceleration pulse is to be character- ized in terms of its change in velocity as obtained by integrating the pendulum accelerometer output. Time (msl Pendulum AV (m/sì 10 1.96 to 2.55 20 4.12 to 5.10 30 5.73 to 7.01 40 to 70 6.27 to 7.64 2. The maximum rotation of the midsagittal plane of the head shall be 64 to 78 degrees with respect to the pendulum. The decaying head rotation vs. time curve shall cross the zero angle between 50 and 70 ms after reaching its peak value. 495</page><page sequence="8">3. The moment about the x-axis which lies in the midsagittal plane of the head at the level of the occipital condyles shall have a maximum value between 88 and 108 Nm. The decaying moment vs. time curve shall first cross zero moment between 40 and 60 ms after reaching its peak value. 4. The maximum rotation of the head with respect to the pendulum shall occur between 0 and 20 ms after peak moment. NOTE: The following formula is to be used to calculate the moment about the occipital condyles when using the six-axis neck trans- ducer M = Mx + 0.01778 Fy where Mx and Fy are the moment and force measured by the transducer and expressed in terms of Nm and N, respectively. APPENDIX B IMPACT RESPONSE VERIFICATION REQUIRE- MENTS FOR THE SHOULDER, THORACIC, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS - These are new compo- nents whose manufacturing processes had to be devel- oped. The following requirements were based on the responses of the first 12 dummies that were manufac- tured. For comparison purposes, the averages of the average responses of the 12 dummies are given along with the coefficients of variations of these averages and the range of the responses.
