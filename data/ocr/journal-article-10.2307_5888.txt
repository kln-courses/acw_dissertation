<plain_text><page sequence="1">selection for coloniality. This linkage of individual strategies with population-level processes is a theme that pervades the book. In the next section, Hoogland addresses questions concerning reproductive stra- tegies. How does reproductive success vary with social group size? How do females attempt to maximize their own reproductive success by killing other group mem- ber's offspring? Why do they subsequently suckle young which they had earlier attempted to kill? He concludes with an analysis of how such reproductive strategies affect demography and population dyna- mics. Throughout the book, Hoogland provides help- ful discussions of strategies that prairie dogs seem not to adopt, as well as those they do. For example, females seem not to manipulate the sex ratios of their litters, nor do they discriminate between close and distant kin. While presenting his results, Hoogland also pro- vides a very individual view of a lifetime's work-he personally collected over 18 000 hours of the behav- ioural data presented. As well as giving an in-depth analysis of prairie dogs' social behaviour, the descrip- tions and photographs reveal Hoogland's deep affec- tion for his study animals. The photograph in the frontispiece, in particular, bears an almost unnatural resemblance to my own grandmother. In addition, the book provides an insight into the technical difficulties faced by any field study of mammal behaviour- especially mammals which may disappear under- ground at any time. Hoogland's ingenuity in over- coming these problems is impressive. As well as using now-conventional techniques, such as molecular gen- etic determination of parentage, we learn how he demonstrated cross-suckling (by injecting females with radionuclides), and proved that females killed the offspring of their close kin (which involved detailed behavioural observations followed by poisonous gas bombs and excavations with a backhoe). The author's idiosyncrasies do also extend to some of the commen- tary. For example, prairie dogs are both social (living in stable, cohesive family groups) and colonial (living at high densities in a shared, limited space), yet Hoog- land makes little distinction between these phenomena in his discussion of the costs and benefits of coloniality. Furthermore, the order of chapters in the book is sometimes surprising. For example, Chapter 7 gives a detailed description of infanticide, perpetrated mainly by breeding females other than the mother, but it is not until Chapter 13 that we learn the details of females' reproductive strategies which help us to interpret the evolutionary causes of such infanticide. These criti- cisms are, however, minor. Taken all together, this book provides a fascinating and impressive analysis of prairie dog behavioural ecology, constantly placing the species in its context among other social animals. I am sure that it will be of value to anyone inter- ested in the evolution of social and reproductive strategies. ROSIE WOODROFFE H.H.T.

This is the first volume in the new 'Wildlife, Ecology and Behaviour' series from Chapman &amp; Hall and if this is the taste of things to come, the series will be both successful and important for researchers and wildlife enthusiasts alike. Professor Prins has spent many years studying African Buffalo, mainly at Lake Manyara in Northern Tanzania, and here condenses his findings and experi- ences into a readable and informative monograph. The main thrust of the book is the examination of why animals live in groups. Basic information about the ecology of the Lake Manyara area, distribution of water, grass and sedge production and consumption and the quality of food available, is given in Chapter 1 and leads directly into Chapter 2 covering buffalo feeding-energy and protein requirements, food intake and feeding activity. Here there is clear agreement with Sinclair (1977) that these animals are limited by their inability to find sufficient high-quality forage, which has dis- appeared in the,late dry season. Examination of the social behaviours of cows and bulls in Chapters 3 and 4 shows a basic plasticity of herd structure among females and 'condition-based' criteria for the presence of males in mixed herds. Attendance of females by males in the mixed herds is associated with a poly- gynous mating system and bachelor herds of poorer condition males. Among males, periodic association in a bachelor group is essential for individuals to improve their condition and re-enter the mating aggre- gations. Chapter 5 looks at population dynamics: of great importance in this field are the effects of predators (lions at Manyara), poaching and disease (rinderpest being the ever-present spectre for this area). Building on information from this and previous chapters, Prins elaborates how the carrying capacity of herbivores in the Manyara ecosystem can be considered as a whole rather than as individual species and how differential effects of independent factors leads to the essential stability of the system. This view that Manyara buffalo exist as part of a stable large herbivore assemblage is expanded in the next chapter by examination of elephant, zebra and wildebeest foraging and the levels of competition between these four species. The clear message is one of fragile stability which could very easily be disrupted by poaching (of elephant) and a recurrence of the earlier rinderpest epidemics of the region. The advantages of group-living in terms of reduced predation risk and enhanced foraging efficiency are considered in some detail: it is of particular interest to 399 Book Reviews ? 1996 British Ecological Society, Journal of Animal Ecology, 65, 398-400</page><page sequence="2">find that buffalo apparently do not take account of predation when selecting grazing patches, and that there is no evidence to suggest that there is any effort to time activity patterns to avoid predator activity; all this in spite of the fact that nearly 88% of adult and subadult animals end up as a lion's meal! The author extends his consideration of social behaviour in this species by looking at cognition, intel- ligence and decision-making. Inclusion of such a con- sideration may be seen as potentially disastrous in 'credibility terms since it becomes all too easy to fall into the twin pitfalls of anthropomorphism and anec- dote. Prins, however, manages to keep this discussion firmly in the field of behavioural ecology by con- sidering this in terms of adaptive significance of the species' social evolution. By stressing the variation of individual buffalo within the herd from the general advantages of the 'average' group member, he high- lights the social inequality which exists between indi- viduals and leads into the concept of the herd as a means by which behavioural adjustments of indi- viduals may be a response to information garnered from the behaviours of conspecifics. In all, this is a highly informative and easily read- able text which makes an excellent companion to, and extension of, the earlier work of Grimsdell (1969) and Sinclair (1977), and helps dispel many of the old myths propagated by white hunters about this animal.

EDITORIAL ANNOUNCEMENT Winner of the Charles Elton Young Investigator's Prize for 1995 We record that the winner of the Charles Elton Young Investigator's Prize for 1995, announced at the AGM meeting in Sheffield in December, was Mr Gareth Russell. Gareth Russell's paper, 'A century of turnover: community dynamics at three timescales' (Vol. 64, pp. 628-641) with Jared Diamond, Stuart Pimm and Timothy Reed arose from his PhD programme currently being conducted at the University of Tennessee. The paper aims to develop a model of how the observed turnover of bird communities changes with the interval over which they are censused. It is the first such model to incorporate the effect of a non-equilibrium number of species. The model fits well the data from 13 small British and Irish islands and suggsts two, asymptotic components to turnover that are important over different timescales. Gareth will graduate in May of this year, after which he will be taking up a post-doctoral position. For 2 years, he will be spending 8 months of the year at the newly formed National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UC Santa Barbara, and 4 months of the year at the Centre for Population Biology at Silwood Park in the UK. ? 1996 British Ecological Society, Journal of Animal Ecology, 65, 398-400 400 Book Reviews</page></plain_text>
