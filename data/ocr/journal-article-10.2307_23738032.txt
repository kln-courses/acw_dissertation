<plain_text><page sequence="1">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING: BOOKS I-VI Toward a New View of the Poem as the Speaker's Experience Harry Berger, Jr. AS MANY RECENT COMMENTATORS HAVE SUGGESTED, Paradise Lost is presented by Milton as the unfolding and changing experience of a particular consciousness—the speaker's—at a particular moment in history. Since, in the present read ing, the perspective of interpretation will focus squarely on this relationship between speaker and poem, it might be fashionable to call it an essay in phenomenological criticism. The organizing principle in terms of which this relation ship develops may be conveniently expressed as a version of Haeckel's familiar axiom: cultural history is recapitulated in personal history, and the dialectical pattern underlying both is enacted in the dynamic unfolding of Paradise Lost. Some of my views on the subject—especially those regard ing Book III—have appeared in a recent issue of the Cen tennial Review (Vol. XI, Winter, 1967), and here I should like to amplify one aspect of that discussion, the relation between Milton's semantics and cosmologies as an index to the developing consciousness of the speaker. By way of un derlining the importance of this aspect, I shall begin with a brief comparison between Dante and Milton. Dante's experience in the Commedia is charted along a pre established visual and spatial course which we understand to be a copy, a verbal rendering of an already existing universe. 483</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW We follow the past experience and the present narrative to gether. The poem is shaped largely by the influence of the world system and cosmic structure which Dante inherits and accepts—even if his own versions of Hell and Purgatory are literary they are treated as literal, as actual places in the spherical world visualized by the poem. His explicit contri bution is to re-present the traditional order in its traditional clarity, to show how it may explain and justify human ex perience on earth, in Europe and in Florence. His poem is, in other words, a kind of Bonaventuran reductio, in every sense a leading-back to God. The copy-situation manifests itself in another way: There are three Dantes in the poem. Dante the pilgrim and Dante the poet-speaker are present to the reader, Dante the maker is not—or rather, pretends not to be, since the poem is presumptively about an actual visionary experience. Dante assumes a clear distinction between the exercise of the poet's art in rhetoric, in the craft of persuasive narra tion, and the world created by God not Dante, the vision received from God by Dante. Thus we have a poet now and a pilgrim then; the poet "copies" the past visionary experi ence so as to share it, make it vivid, disclose the way of sal vation to other wayfarers; the focus of the poem is on the then rather than on the now, though the poet frequently lets it be known that he would like us to appreciate the greatness of his achievement as a poet. The relation between the now and the then is fundamental but not static. Toward the end of each canticle the speaker becomes more involved and excited; he is pulled back into the past experience as its vividness overcomes him now in the act of writing or speaking. The reasons are different in each canticle. In Hell, for example, the poet as well as the pilgrim betrays a morbid interest in suffering, a morbid gratification at having his pity stirred, an anger which is not at all proper Christian indignation but is rather a strain of pessimism, frustrated idealism, seeing the whole world as evil because it is not 484</page><page sequence="3">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING perfect, giving up on life as it is. Most important, he reveals a morbid interest in the physical and literal spectacle of Hell during the late cantos. Dante the maker presents Dante the speaker as excessively fascinated by the tabloid details im mediately before him rather than by the total plan. We see this first perhaps in the slapstick Malacoda cantos, where the narrator gives himself to the scene in such a way that it is hard to keep attention on what is important—the spiritual torment, the inner pain and distortion of self, the privation of good. Similarly, in presenting the metamorphoses of the thieves in Canto xxv, Dante seems more interested in his de scriptive virtuosity and allegorical ingenuity than in the larger ethical significance. This is all shadow action, a kind of poetry which, as he reminds us (xxv.94), is borrowed from the pagans, yet the scene clearly grips the poet now as well as the pilgrim then. It is this very sense of being im posed on, obsessed, tyrannized by the past, of being unable to transform and creatively redirect past experience, which characterizes the infernal condition; this tyranny is the per verse form of the true copy-situation in which the traditional order and past experience are recovered, rendered newly significant and functional as part of the present quest of the living soul. In Paradise Lost the relation between the past experience and the present narration is totally different. Here is the actual sequence of events in the past experience: Creation of the Son; revolt, defeat and fall of angels; building of Pandemonium; creation of earth and man; ascent of Satan to Eden; Raphael's visit with Adam and Eve; temptation and fall; re-education by Michael; exile. Here, on the other hand, is the narrative sequence: Fall of angels to Hell; building of Pandemonium, conclave, etc.; ascent of Satan to Eden; Raphael's visit and his account of: creation of the Son, revolt and war in Heaven, creation of the earth; temp tation and fall; re-education and exile. The original tem poral flow is sustained only in the last four books. Thus in Paradise Lost, unlike the Commedia, our attention and un 485</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW derstanding are guided largely by the present rearrangement of inherited materials which Milton orders according to his own poetic plan and vision. Milton calls this rearrangement an argument. In The Art of Logic (translated by A. H. Gilbert) he defines an argu ment as that which has a fitness for arguing something . . . that is for showing, explaining, or proving something . . . the proper and primary potency of a simple argument is to explain and prove how one thing follows or does not follow from another; that is, it is judged that when one thing has been laid down as true something else is or is not also laid down originally. Our Bacon . . . rightly suggests the same thing about induction: "By one and the same operation of the mind the thing in question is both invented and judged." . . . An argument in the proper sense of the word is not a word or a thing, but a certain fitness of something for arguing; this . . . can be called reason. The poem is a fictional argument, a manifestation of hy pothetical causes one function of which is to make sense of disjointed modern times. Considered tonally and dynami cally as utterance, the poem is a sustained arguing in the present tense. But more conventionally, as exemplified by the arguments preceding each book (and not included in the first edition), the ways of God and tradition are causally justified by the new arrangement of events, the shape and plan whereby the ancient wisdom is revived and reordered to express the new Idea of this poet. If the preliminary arguments are like blueprints articulating the basic plot of each book, they are also reminders of the extent to which Milton has transformed what he has inherited. Where Dante treats traditional culture and cosmology as exemplars in terms of which to order his poem, Milton appeals to them as models. He uses mythic and cosmographic data like stage sets which give the reader initial directions and visualize the ethico-spiritual polarities of the argument. The elements or episodes of the original events, the traditional sequence of 486</page><page sequence="5">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING Sacred History, are not assigned any structural value in themselves. Since the tradition has become a source of scepticism rather than of dogma or belief, the poet feels compelled to justify God in his own way; he brings out God's order by rearranging the received elements in a nar rative scheme which alone will restore them to their per suasiveness as "causes," explanations, simple arguments. Thus where Dante stylistically subordinates the poet's now to the pilgrim's then, Milton's argument, voice, and verse make it quite clear that the most immediate experience of Paradise Lost is not the then being recalled, but the very free treatment of it in the now. If our main response to Dante is seeing the image, to Mil ton it is hearing the voice. For voice is the externalization of that moral energy which Milton calls "right reason," and right reason may, without too much latitude, be defined as uncloistered consciousness testing its own quality and that of the norms imposed on it by subjecting them to the con tinual play and pressure of experience. The essential form of moral energy is not action in the world, but the inner conflict, the struggle toward decision, which precedes this action. Such a principle is not conceived as requiring space, or as existing in space and time; it creates time by its very nature, since it unfolds in the order of succession. Its most appropriate expressive medium is therefore the discursive instrument of language, and the most important elements of that language are not nouns, which name what is already in existence, but verbs and prepositions, through which the mind defines, controls, creates, destroys and re-creates the relationships and therefore the orders which constitute its world. Milton's treatment of creation and of the cosmic effects of the fall suggests that the phenomena of nature and his tory are externalizations or embodiments of moral force. His view of the cosmic continuum of Book V suggests that this energy is the highest and most real form of existence, the condition to which other forms strive and which they, in 487</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW so striving, sustain. Thus physical energy appears as either the primitive or the degraded form of moral energy; as en ergy moves down the continuum it becomes increasingly volcanic, uncontrolled and self-destroying, increasingly brute and blind. The denser the matter, the more volcanic the force, the more compelling the sensuous image—the more primitive (pre-moral) or degraded (immoral) the en ergy. In all this Milton leans heavily on the new dissociation of spiritual from physical hierarchies developed in different ways by the Florentine Platonists and by Calvin. His own treatment is a way of provisionally solving the dilemma per ceived by Donne in the First Anniversary, the "weakness in the want of correspondence of heaven and earth." The physical size and place of the earth are of little consequence in themselves, since its importance lies in its being the node and center of a continually developing spiritual or moral universe which has no fixed physical character. Cosmologi cal theories are finally to be judged not by their scientific accuracy but by their usefulness in serving the needs of moral symbolism, e.g., "for the Heav'n's wide Circuit, let it speak/The Maker's high magnificence" (VIII.100-101). In Paradise Lost, when the spatial environment has served its symbolic purpose it is retracted, dissolved, or turned more patently into emblem and artifice. The various bridges and routes leading the cosmic warriors—Satan, Sin, Death and the Son—into the soul may be destroyed or dis carded when they have served their functions. In Kantian terms, Milton uses the forms of the external intuition to visualize aspects of inner process, and he frequently reminds us of their hypothetical nature by presenting his universe in whole or in part, as an artifact, a toy model, or the locus of a literal melodrama somewhat absurdly acted out as physical spectacle. It is the very absurdity of the War in Heaven which implies the great gap between visual symbol and spiritual referent, and which shows the need of the new symbolic relationships developed in the second half of the poem. 488</page><page sequence="7">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING In human experience, at both the individual and the his torical levels, moral development proceeds through a dialec tic of self-expansion and self-limitation, a dialectic which Milton imitates in his poetic narrative. He begins with vast, extensive and externally epic gestures, criticizes his own scope and ambitiousness at the beginning of Book VII, and promises to limit himself to the tiny earth. He then expands the earth "inwardly" by making it the new moral center of the universe. The moral gesture of self-limitation cannot take place until the mind has first probed its expansive powers, has tried to fulfill its wishes by making the whole universe its place. Similarly the physical, the external, and the sensuous cannot be controlled so as to express inner moral force until they have first been experienced, enjoyed, evaluated in and for themselves. The appeal to sensuous experience and sensuous modes of imagining is partly an attempt to make the self passive to its fantasies, to withdraw into some idyllic cloister. The appeal to spatial experience and to visualizing techniques of imagination is partly an effort to negate the irreversible thrust and pressure of time, for time is the true medium of moral force and moral force thrives on inner conflict. II Two aspects of the relationship between poet and poem are embodied in the double invocation toward which the open ing lines of Paradise Lost tend: Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth Rose out of Chaos: Or if Sion Hill Delight thee more, and Siloa's Brook that flow'd Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence Invoke thy aid to my advent'rous Song, That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th' Aonian Mount, while it pursues Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhyme. 489</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure, Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark Illumine, what is low raise and support; That to the highth of this great Argument I may assert Eternal Providence, And justify the ways of God to men. (I.6-26) The relation to Urania has to do with Milton as public poet rather than with Milton as private man; with Milton as an essentially passive (inspired) medium of communication rather than with Milton as active moral agent; with poetry as something akin to prophecy or revelation rather than with poetry as fable, fantasy or inner edification. The divine prospect connected with Urania is at once more external and more remote than that connected with the Spirit. The associations of the first section are historical, cultural, and institutional, while the rhetoric with which Milton de scribes his purpose is that of the heroic poet who hopes to continue and transcend the great tradition. The transition from the first to the second part is thus very much like that from the first to the second half of Paradise Lost. The expansive and extensive character of "advent'rous Song" and "Things unattempted yet" gives way to the more intimate appeal, the more austere humility, of Protestant heroism. Milton's thought moves from the tops of actual if remote mountains to the inner height of this great argument. He asks the Spirit for assistance which is at once poetic and ethical: since "instruct me" can mean "build within me," or "build me up within," as well as "teach me," will and mind are involved together. The Spirit is to preside over Milton's ethos and over his poem, and we may speculate that the development of one is not separable from that of the other. Perhaps one of the "things unattempted yet" for which the Spirit is chiefly responsible is this identity of poetry with moral action. Making and ut 490</page><page sequence="9">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING tering the poem seem presented to the reader partly as the manifest working of the Third Person in the soul, partly as the response of the soul, the arduous effort to meet so great a charge and privilege. That the Spirit demands more active participation than the Muse, that the writing of a poem may involve a risk which is ethical as well as esthetic, is suggested by the vague image which hovers over lines 19-22—hovers after, if not before, we have read further in the first two books. It is the image of Satan, who also sat brooding over a vast abyss, and who illumined Hell by raising Pandemonium. The same association is more explicit in the invocation to Book III in which Milton, after describing Satan's flight from Hell, ap plies it as an image to his own activity: Thee I revisit now with bolder wing, Escap't the Stygian Pool, though long detain'd In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne With other notes than to the Orphean Lyre I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night, Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down The dark descent, and up to reascend, Though hard and rare. ... (III. 12-21) Milton of course distinguishes his source from Satan's, who had proclaimed himself at II.975 as "Alone, and without guide," though by the beginning of the ninth book the poet seems less sure that an appeal to the Muse will automatically procure inspiration: "If answerable style I can obtain/ Of My Celestial Patroness," he will succeed, but not "if all be mine,/ Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear" (IX.20 21, 46-47). The message may be obscured by other forces and motives within his soul. The fear that the poem may be nothing more than a self-created fantasy echoes in a differ ent mood Satan's fatuous speculation that the angels were "self-begot, self-rais'd/ By our own quick'ning power" (V. 860-861). 491</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW What Milton actually thought about his poetic activity and its sources is irrelevant here. What he presents is a poet aware of the satanic possibility, a poet who knows that if the soul is a battlefield for the cosmic struggle it may well be deceived by Satan posing as muse. The poetic act, like every human act, every creative decision and assertion of will, in volves a calculated risk. How can the poet really be sure whether the vision he "receives" comes from heaven or hell, whether it is a truly inspired justification or merely a pre sumptuous fantasy, the working of original sin within him? If the muse descends, then the poem may be a symbol of what is substantially real, more real than itself; it will be, for all its size, like a sacramental ark. If the muse does not descend, the poem may be a vast and glittering Pandemo nium, an externalization of the satanic forces within the poet's soul. A poem, a verbal artifact, is a more inward, per sonal and therefore "evolved" expression than a visual and architectural object, but it may be evil as well as good which has evolved to a subtler because invisible fabric. The man who makes a poem does and reveals much more than the men who made the Tabernacle; both as a mortal and as an individual, his role is greater, his experience and per spective more important. But he is bound by the same prin ciple of self-constraint raised to a higher power: like the sanctuary and ark, the poem is framed by God's prescript, and in the poem "his Testimony,/ The Records of his Cov' nant," the covenant between muse or Holy Spirit and the inward heart and pure. Contrary to this is the merely organic impulse to projec tion, self-expansion and endless (because unregulated) cre ative complication. It is the tendency expressed by the adornment of the "Fabric huge" of Pandemonium, by the wanton growth of cosmological fantasies "scribbl'd o'er" God's "Fabric of the Heav'ns" (VIII.75ff.), by Adam's early response to Eve's physical beauty ("Too much of Ornament, in outward show/ Elaborate," VIII.538-539), and by Bel ial's men "in wandering mazes lost" (II.561). There is no 492</page><page sequence="11">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING doubt that Milton in his poem takes a deliberate step in this direction, that he gives play to fabulous and rococo impulses within himself, that he consciously experiments with satanic and archaic modes of imagination as a prelude to containing and transcending them. Thus the critical event and enveloping action of the first six books is the revolt of the angels, presented in heroic or chivalric terms by a poet who easily slips into an angelic persona and anthropomorphizes heaven. Blending heaven and earth together, converting spiritual motive to physical image, he lowers the former and raises the latter. By re arranging the plot and placing the first event—the war in heaven—last, he not only produces a circular or time abolishing effect, but also concludes the first half of Para dise Lost with a Happy Ending: good and evil are clearly separated, evil clearly defeated and cast out by means of a single cosmic combat. After the heroic test of arms, the good angels will presumably live happily, the demons unhappily, ever after. If the angelic revolt and fall is a paradigm for man, it is cast in a Homeric or chivalric mode—the wrath of stern Messiah, the "long and tedious havoc" of "fabl'd Knights in Battles feign'd." As presented in V and VI, the warring angels do seem fabled and feigned, the product of human invention rather than revealed knowledge. The in vention is hyperbolic and broad-planed rather than subtle; it is "archetypal" in the sense of being both grand and a lit tle fusty, the simplified and archaic image of a recurrent human concern. If we did not feel this while reading Book VI, Milton reminds us of it when, in the invocation to VII, he reverses his direction, and also in the invocation to IX where he in effect cites the antique source and model of the war in heaven. We can hardly read this last invocation with out being newly struck by the fact that the poet had himself extended the subject and style of heroic imagination from earth to heaven, that he presents himself to us as recognizing this fact and correcting himself. He reminds us that real human evil demands a paradigm totally different from the 493</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW war in heaven, something less grand and cosmic, less literal and external, less simplistic in its image of the central po larities. I believe this is why Milton does not allow either of his two primary figures—God and Satan—to be entirely satis factory as embodiments of pure good and evil. I have dis cussed Milton's deliberately limited view of God in the Cen tennial Review essay already mentioned, and shall only add here that I think the poem represents as one of its dramatic issues the problem of establishing a creature sufficiently other to God to allow Him meaningfully to act on and in teract with that creature. Such a creature will be man, not Satan. Narcissism is a threat to the poet's early anthropo morphic image of God as it is a threat to all other figures in the poem. A tyrannical God who runs the whole show cannot fulfill himself by simply reduplicating his image in defective and inferior creatures lacking true independence. Satan is not sufficiently other to God for a number of reasons: First, because he is simply God's instrument and his behavior, as I shall show, is totally determined from the outside. The other reasons are all founded on a fact which critics have long noticed but failed to understand: the fact that the Sa tanic trinity is an infernal parody of the divine trinity. The terms in which I have just stated that fact reflect the basis of misunderstanding: if we take the temporal sequence of the poem seriously, we shall be more inclined to say that the divine trinity emerges as an image of the satanic trinity. God and Satan are too much alike in early stages of the poem. The need for revised images of God and his Son be comes obvious when we realize that Satan's characterizations of them as thunderer and warrior are accurate. There can be no meaning, no fulfillment, for God in a victory over Satan, nor in a punishment which so disables man after the Fall that no good could possibly originate from his will (the image of man delineated by God in Book III). It is only from within the consciousness of a human creature who has real alternatives (Satan or God), who can really suffer and 494</page><page sequence="13">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING lose, who can initiate action, can make demands on God and even change his relation to God as he himself changes through history—only from within such an other set in some way over against God can the divine point of view be ful filled. We might ask to what extent Milton conceives Satan as an actual figure in cosmic history, to what extent as a complex personification of certain human tendencies. If primarily the former, then his myth must be construed as aetiological —i.e., what Satan did in prehistory partly caused and ex plains the way man has always behaved in history. If pri marily the latter, then his myth does not seriously pretend to record prehistory or provide a real causal explanation; the myth of Satan is an analogy, a fictional or hypothetical cause devised ex post facto to make sense of the divine and human behavior revealed in history and in experience. My own interpretation obviously leans toward the latter ac count, since I assume that in the character of Satan Milton has abstracted and externalized what he believes to be the essence of human evil. And this, if we stop to consider it, leads to a peculiar situation: Milton's Satan is more like an effect of human behavior than a cause; Satan is a Active visualization who plainly manifests what is already the case within the human soul, but what is seldom so visible in ordinary life. Yet he appears in the poem as an archetypal cause. I think we are supposed to be sensible of this discrepancy. We are to look on the character of Satan as an invention of a certain kind, as the product of a particular imagination. He seems conceived as a sometimes pathetic, sometimes melodramatic and moustache-twirling personification of evil projected at the level of mythic fairy tale. This is, again, a relatively childlike view which Milton first gives play to and then transcends: Satan is dangerous not as a warrior or bogey man but as a sophist; his mission is fulfilled when his bad influence is infused in the human soul—when Eve is impregn'd by his false dialectic—and when his effects, Sin 495</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW and Death, establish themselves on earth not as personifica tions but as human conditions. The poetic justice accorded the fictional character Satan in Hell (X.504-584) is clearly a secondary consideration. The personification o£ evil who is periodically transformed into a serpent, who occupies a particular place farthest away from God in a cosmos which, to the educated minds of Milton's age, was mythic or ficti tious—this remote and easily identified figure of evil is pre sented by Milton as being controlled within the fabulous prehistory of his feigned world but not in the actual world of fallen men where his bad influence abides. Milton has, after all, delineated his father of evil in the antique and primary mode of early culture, after the heroic and stark imagination of pagans and Hebrews. His concluding account of Satan in effect returns the character to his sources, fades him out, as it were, until he recedes to the distances of old beliefs and traditions: Thus were they plagu'd And worn with Famine long, and ceaseless hiss, Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, Yearly enjoin'd, some say, to undergo This annual humbling certain number'd days, To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. However some tradition they dispers'd Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they call'd Ophion with Eurynome, the wide Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. (X.572-584, italics mine) The demons, that is, persuaded the ancients to view the conquest of evil in heroic and conclusive terms, externaliz ing it as a military campaign and projecting it back into archaic times. Evil as Satan has fulfilled its function in Mil ton's argument. Evil internalized as sin makes itself felt in the lines which immediately follow. 496</page><page sequence="15">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING III There is, then, something of the satanic as well as of the archaic in the expanding, soaring, outward-bound vision of the first six books. This triumphant movement, this confi dent visualization of the spiritual, this clear exorcism and defeat of the enemy through the panacea of personification and allegorical vision—all this belongs to the native assur ance Milton knew in his earlier years and thus to the habit of imagination he ascribes to the early phases of culture. Its youthful vitality and beauty still draw him while he recog nizes its dangers. It is not of course the youthful assurance itself we see, but a late autumnal portrait of it, a portrait which gives that earlier and still vivid sensibility its play while containing and evaluating it, a portrait which shows how far it can go, where it must stop, to what it may lead, and thus how it may be fulfilled in being rejected, or at least sharply tempered. To focus the satanic aspect of this more clearly, we must recognize a more complex representation than that of the figure of evil on which I have been dwelling. The image of Satan is simplistic insofar as it is unrelievedly negative, one side of human nature abstracted from the richer mixture. But the evil which Milton abstracts and portrays is itself complex, familiar and central to the western literary tradi tion. It is the Kierkegaardian sickness unto death which Milton could have found in Dante, Chaucer or Spenser— that syndrome of which pride and despair are two aspects, each entailing the other, pride the surface and despair the ground. Its basis is in pain and self-hatred, its effects are the various forms of escape from pain, self or God, its ultimate aim is the transformation of self into God, the delusive hope of absolute power or pleasure. The satanic condition is so obsessively bound to the wheel of an original choice that it cannot control the outward thrust of mind objectifying it self into its own place and prison. The fall of the angels was qualitatively complete in Sa 497</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW tan's first moment of revolt: "fraught with envy against the Son of God," he could not bear Through pride that sight, and thought himself impair'd. Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain, Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supreme, Contemptuous. . . . (V.664-671) We see first his misguided and weak nature—the sight he could not bear, the envy and pride which overwhelm him as affects, the erroneous sense of injured merit ("thought him self impair'd"). The phrase thence conceiving suggests a response which seems half-del ibera te, the not quite invol untary assumption of a fixed emotional role—malice and disdain—by an actor who might have chosen otherwise. His next response is symbolic rather than tactical: having de cided on malice and disdain he resolves to externalize it in a gesture of contempt; spatial distance is simply the visual dis play of the new inner withdrawal. His warfare and fall to Hell is not a new phase of his condition but a symbolic game, a pageant or manifestation which publishes and ful fills on the graph of external action what had already hap pened within the demonic soul. Thus God to Abdiel: Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought The better fight, who single has maintain'd Against revolted multitudes the Cause Of Truth, in word mightier than they in Arms; And for the testimony of Truth hast borne Universal reproach, far worse to bear Than violence.... (VI.29-35) "The easier conquest now remains," i.e., the physical war fare and violence which are mere effects of the fixed malice and disdain. In Book VI the demons not only gravitate to ward their new home, they register the stages of gravitation 498</page><page sequence="17">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING as God lets them externalize their inherent tendencies. They shift from words to deeds, turn heaven into earth (even into an analogue of hell, VI.472-491), and invent an instrument, the cannon, which precisely expresses the na ture of satanic energy, as Milton himself had characterized it in previous passages, e.g.: his dire attempt, which nigh the birth Now rolling, boils in his tumultuous breast, And like a devilish Engine back recoils Upon himself.... (IV.15-18) The mechanic fury and violence with which the satanic mind is driven to objectify itself is suggested in our very first view of the arch-demon: But his doom Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes That witness'd huge affliction and dismay Mixt with obdurate pride and steadfast hate: At once as far as Angels ken he views The dismal Situation waste and wild, A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames No light, but rather darkness visible Serv'd only to discover sights of woe. . . . (I.53-64) Witness'd may mean both saw and revealed; we see first the inward prospect of satanic pain, brought even closer to us by Milton's shift from the narrative past to the historical present (expressing Satan's limited view of himself as in midcareer), and we then watch that mental anguish thrown, as it were, from his eyes to the surrounding dungeon. The ambiguous phrase to discover sights of woe completes the projective movement and confirms the correspondence of inner and outer Situations. From this moment on the col onization and organization of hell, the exfoliation of Satan's soul, takes place with the speed and ease of fantasy. Like Dantesque sinners, the demons instinctively create around 499</page><page sequence="18">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW them a world, shadowy yet real, which is the effect and ex tension of the prison of self, which both symbolizes their ex isting pain and causes them new pain: Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, Sad Acheron of Sorrow, black and deep; Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. (II.576-580) Apart from the actual plot situation, or containing it, there is a verbal or rhetorical "plot" binding the first two books together into an epitome of satanic process as it spreads out from the center of self, divides into simple components (as in the rigged parliament in which each speaker voices one aspect of the total satanic attitude), thins away into the dis tortions of self which Satan fathered (Sin and Death, more purely allegorical, therefore shadowy, than Satan) and fi nally spends itself in a Chaos whose swirling fragments are so described as to recall previous moments of description (e.g., 11.888, 898, 905, 933). Like the Inferno, Books I and II are visualized and voiced in an essentially archaic mode, in "pagan" imagery and rhetoric which suggest the speaker's affinity to the impulses he knows he must contain. Milton and Satan are closer in these books than they are later; by Book VI Satan as warrior hero has become a slightly comic figure. He has in fact been too easily exor cized and labelled, too easily diminished in stature, by both God and the speaker. If we see from I to VI a gradual "re jection" of Satan and the satanic imagination on the speak er's part, I think we are also expected to see another and more insidious danger: Milton playing Raphael, trying out the exalted and panoramic perspective of good angels with which it is tempting to identify oneself. It is obviously eas ier to detach oneself from a bad angel, however heroic, than from a good one. And to assume the persona and vision of the good angel is to risk seeing things too clearly—compare 5°°</page><page sequence="19">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING the murk, the fluid and volatile shifting of shadowy forms, which characterizes the brilliant vision of hell, with the all too lucid and literal view of the war in heaven. (I should emphasize here that I am not speaking about a defect in the poem, but about a defect in the speaker's assumed point of view, a defect which is a phase in the unfolding experience of narration.) From III through VI there is a double effect of spreading out from the center—the earth—and squeezing together the extremities of the world. The following dis cussion will examine some aspects of this process. IV In moving into Book III from Book II, Milton gives us a sense of the vastness of the cosmos, emphasizing the great physical and spiritual gap separating heaven from hell. Sa tan, at 11.1045®., beholds Far off the' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide In circuit, undetermin'd square or round, With Opal Tow'rs and Battlements adorn'd Of living Sapphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Star Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. Here, though we are aware of distances, especially of Heav en's distance from Satan, the cosmos is small and toy-like, or rather jewel-like—a gem for Satan to pluck from the ear of Night. After his invocation to the holy light in III, the speaker's imagination leaps to heaven and assumes the divine perspective, God's "prospect high,/ Wherein past, present, future he beholds" (III.77-78): Now had the Almighty Father from above, From the pure Empyrean where he sits High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye, His own works and their works at once to view: About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as Stars, and from his sight receiv'd Beatitude past utterance.... (III.56-62) 501</page><page sequence="20">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW From III.80 to 343, the poet impersonates Father and Son in a dialogue which emphasizes God's repeatedly affirmed distance from the evil in his creation. This is followed by a description of cheering angels which is simple, unguarded and childlike in its literalness: The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung With Jubilee, and loud Hosannas fill'd Th' eternal Regions; lowly reverent Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and God, Immortal Amarant, a Flow'r which once In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life Began to bloom, but soon for man's offence To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, And flow'rs aloft shading the Fount of Life, And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heav'n Rolls o'er Elysian Flow'rs her Amber stream; With these that never fade the Spirits elect Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shone Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd. Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took, Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by thir side Like Quivers hung... .(III.345-367) The only rhetorical qualifiers which might indicate this as a human image, and not the reality, are displaced: as from does not mean "as from voices," but "as from very many and very blest voices." The pavement like a sea and the harps like quivers direct our attention to sensuous comparisons and reinforce the literal vividness of the scene. Though these are painted or theatrical angels, they are imagined and presented with ingenuous directness. Milton raises no questions here, as he does later, about the language of ac commodation. If the pagan elements of the image suggest childlike fantasy, the scriptural echoes suggest apocalyptic 502</page><page sequence="21">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING vision, as if the poet's plea to the holy light had been an swered and he had become a vessel of God: Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight. (111.52-55) When, toward the end of their hymn, the angels slip into the first person singular ("thy Name/ Shall be the copious matter of my Song," III.412-413), Merritt Hughes remarks that "throughout P. L., as the invocations to the Heavenly Muse imply, Milton regards himself as almost a member of the choir of angels." Throughout and almost are misleading, but certainly in this part of the poem he displays a confi dence in his visionary or visualizing power which he will later question. Because he does not here bring the issue of angelic perspective into view as a dramatic fact, the reader tends to accept the scene at face value. If we are disturbed by Book III we should consider that Milton himself later brings the source of disturbance out into the open—I think we should not be disturbed by him because we are meant to be disturbed with him. It is interesting that critics disturbed by the poet's atti tude toward God in III should not be equally disturbed by his treatment of the garden in IV. For this book has aptly been described as a sustained act of "narrative inattention" (I borrow the phrase from my friend and former student, Mr. H. M. Leicester, who remarked that Book IV is "thrown" on the narrative just as the mountain and garden are thrown "upon the rapid current" of the "River large" that runs southward through Eden). Milton's treatment of the garden suggests that it is a place of withdrawal for him self as well as for Adam. What it embodies is not so much an ideal as an idyll, and the poet's lavish rhetoric makes it clear that he is gratifying his own wishes in describing para dise. If he gives play to this urge, however, he does so only while adopting the perspective of Satan, from whose pros 5°3</page><page sequence="22">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW pect most of the garden is viewed. He is aware, like Satan, that the garden is not for him; he is also aware that Satan's envy of paradise and man's nostalgia for the "lost" green world may be intertwined. The desire to escape from one self and one's painful condition is pathetic in Satan but dangerous in man, and Milton allows his very act of de scribing the garden to be associated with Satan seeing it: Beneath him with new wonder now he views To all delight of human sense expos'd In narrow room Nature's whole wealth, yea more, A Heaven on Earth. (IV.205-208) Satan had earlier been compared to "a Thief bent to un hoard the cash/ Of some rich Burgher" (IV. 188-189), and we are certainly allowed to feel that too much of nature's wealth is hoarded in too narrow a room; earth under the aspect of garden is too heavenly. Milton sees the garden as offering or exposing itself like a temptress: the flow'ry lap Of some irriguous Valley spread her store, Flow'rs of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant; meanwhile murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills, disperst or in a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crown'd, Her crystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. The Birds thir quire apply; airs, vernal airs, Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance Led on th' Eternal Spring. (IV.254-268) The image, growing cosmetic and literary, has more in com mon with Spenser's Bower of Bliss than with his Garden of Adonis, for here all things conspire in a single display of pleasure, a display which is as controlled and deliberate as 504</page><page sequence="23">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING a dance. There is no need of time or change or larger space because, as Milton later shows, the whole world reaches it self into Eve's hands, Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yields In India East or West, or middle shore In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kinds.... (V.338-341) The poet's own response to Adam and Eve contains within its complex structure a Satanic element. He envies mainly the ease and simplicity of their innocent—i.e., im mature—love: into thir inmost bower Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off These troublesome disguises which wee wear, Straight side by side were laid, nor turn'd I ween Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd: Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk. . . . (IV.738-744) The "I ween" reminds us that the poet is speculating from the distance perhaps of his own disappointment. His subse quent praise of "wedded Love, mysterious Law" appears at first to continue the description of Adam and Eve (750 752) but changes to the quite different praise of post lapsarian marriage. The rarity and difficulties of this ideal are shadowed in the references to hypocrites and harlots, to "Court Amours," Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Ball, Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. (IV.767-770) From this he turns sharply away, escaping back to the vision of paradisaic love, and seeks refuge in a brief counterfactual wish: These lull'd by Nightingales imbracing slept, And on thir naked limbs the flow'ry roof 505</page><page sequence="24">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Show'r'd Roses, which the Morn repair'd. Sleep on, Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek No happier state, and know to know no more. (IV.771-775) This is not, as we know, Milton's reasoned feeling; it repre sents a moment of weakness. His total response is radically different from Satan's, yet he reveals in both voices a dan gerously common emotional ground, and he might well have assigned some of Satan's sentiments to himself, e.g.: Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh Your change approaches, when all these delights Will vanish and deliver ye to woe.... (IV.366-368) And should I at your harmless innocence Melt, as I do, yet public reason just, Compels me now To do what else though damn'd I should abhor. (IV.388-392) Knowledge forbidd'n? Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord Envy them that? can it be sin to know, Can it be death? and do they only stand By Ignorance, is that thir happy state, The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? O fair foundation laid whereon to build Thir ruin! (IV.515-522) Again in the ninth book, it is to suggest a similar moment of weakness that Milton laments, "O much deceiv'd, much failing, hapless Eve" (IX.404), and nostalgically reiterates the catalogue of gardens, reminding us at the same time that such literal garden-images (his more delicious than others) are escapes from pain and meaning unless spiritual ized by allegorical revision: Spot more delicious than those Gardens feign'd Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renown'd Alcinous, host of old Laertes' Son, Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian Spouse. (IX.439-443, italics mine) 5°6</page><page sequence="25">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING And in the next line the city-dwelling poet's perspective merges with Satan's, or rather catches up the satanic longing, in a comparison which is itself—local, familiar, ages removed from that terrible threshold of history—a brief holiday from the painful narrative, a brief withdrawal which delays the climax: Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. As one who long in populous City pent, Where houses thick and Sewers annoy the Air, Forth issuing on a Summer's Morn to breathe Among the pleasant Villages and Farms Adjoin'd, from each thing met conceives delight, The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, Or Dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound; If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, What pleasing seem'd, for her now pleases more, She most, and in her look sums all Delight. Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold This Flow'ry Plat, the sweet recess of Eve Thus early, thus alone; her Heav'nly form Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine. . . . (IX.444-458) There is an echo of that critical moment described a little earlier in which Eve withdrew her hand from Adam's "and like a Wood-Nymph light . . . / Betook her to the Groves" (IX.386-388), and another, even more revealing of Milton's response, of Adam's excessive love of Eve's physical beauty: "What seem'd fair in all the World, seem'd now/ Mean, or in her summ'd up" (VIII.472-473). Thus Milton depicts himself projecting and virtually falling in love with his own images; yet at the same time, by qualifying the images, he contains and evaluates his response. The same technique is evident in Book V. Describing Eve's culinary art, Milton makes her appear a little too curious and "exact of taste," a little too anxious to please her angelic visitor's palate, yet the passage is voiced in the nostalgic 507</page><page sequence="26">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW tone of one who himself lingers over the lovely age of green or gold when all things reached themselves into the hand: She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent What choice to choose for delicacy best, What order, so contriv'd as not to mix Tastes, not well join'd, inelegant, but bring Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yields In India East or West, or middle shore In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kinds, in coat, Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths From many a berry, and from sweet kernels prest She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd. (V.332-349) This tone continues in the lines immediately following: Meanwhile our Primitive great Sire, to meet His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train Accompani'd then with his own complete Perfections, in himself was all his state, More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long Of Horses led, and Grooms besmear'd with Gold Dazzles the crowd.... (V.350-357) It is a nostalgia not only for a simpler more unencumbered time, but also for an easier more indolent time—not only a critique of decadence and aspiration, but also an antiheroic (and antiMiltonic) praise of cloistered and effortless exist ence. The sentiment penetrates Adam's greeting to Raphael, who deigns to visit those two 508</page><page sequence="27">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING who yet by sovran gift possess This spacious ground, in yonder shady Bow'r To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears To sit and taste, till this meridian heat Be over, and the Sun more cool decline. (V.366-370) And it also resonates in the angel's answer, as he refers to the nearness of men and heavenly beings: nor art thou such Created, or such place hast here to dwell, As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bow'r O'ershades; for these mid-hours, till Ev'ning rise I have at will. (V.372-377) Later, after his famous stage direction, "No fear lest Dinner cool" (V.396), and after Raphael's short introductory account of angelic feeding habits (V.426-434), Milton allows him self a last wistful glance backwards before the long day's talking: Meanwhile at Table Eve Minister'd naked, and thir flowing cups With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, Then had the Sons of God excuse to have been Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousy Was understood, the injur'd Lover's Hell. (V.443-450) But this response, sensuous and verging on sensual, had been preceded by a passage in which the poet's feeling, though present, was contained within a perspective which was tonally and rhetorically more complicated: So to the Silvan Lodge They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd With flow'rets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve Undeckt, save with herself more lovely fair Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, 509</page><page sequence="28">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no veil Shee needed, Virtue-proof, no thought infirm Alter'd her cheek. On whom the Angel Hail Bestow'd, the holy salutation us'd Long after to blest Mary, second Eve. Hail Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons Than with these various fruits the Trees of God Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassy turf Thir table was, and mossy seats had round, And on her ample Square from side to side All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here Danc'd hand in hand. (V.377-395) Eve's nakedness symbolizes her innocent truth and virtue, her obviously good intentions, but something else is sug gested in the classical analogies: though she is fairer than a dryad or Venus or Ida, there are ways in which she may not be very different from them. As the Pomona of Paradise she is justly proud of her domain, confident of its—and her— ability "to entertain our Angel guest." But she is closely interinvolved with her garden. This is suggested by Raph ael's salutation "Hail Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb . . . ," which echoes the poet's recent reference to "Earth all-bearing Mother" (V.338). It is more pervasively suggested throughout the poem in phrases which by impli cation transfer attributes back and forth between Eve and her flowers, fruits and trees—especially the tree and fruit of knowledge (e.g., IV.269-170 and IX.424-432, IX.794-804 and 834-838, 849-852 and 892-901, 1100-1107). The Narcissa passage, in which Eve longs for her image in the lake "that to me seem'd another Sky" (IV.456-480), may be seen as a synecdoche of her total situation: she loves not only her garden per se but her image in the garden, her self as re flected in her domain; this is why, even at the end, it takes some effort to pry her loose from her native soil and persuade her to follow her husband (XI.268-292). All this seems to me to be packed into the transition from Pomona's arbor through the wood nymph to Venus trying to impress the 510</page><page sequence="29">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING connoisseur on Ida and win the prize, and the transition in turn colors the phrase "Stood to entertain." Entertain is else where used by Satan with explicit irony (IV.382, V.690, VI.611), and here it is made to betray intentions of which Eve is unaware, intentions all the more dangerous because unconscious: she receives Raphael as a guest, tries to amuse, please and divert him, perhaps also to hold him a willing captive in her garden (intertenere) as long as she can. In her own person as in her property and domestic skill, she would like him to feel "that here on Earth/ God hath dis pense his bounties as in Heav'n." If we admit the associa tions clinging to the wood-nymph we are reminded of a figure whose virgin independence, or daunger, is a function of her first love, her loyalty to the region from which she is by nature inseparable, the region which protects, expresses and belongs to her, as she in turn protects and personifies it. Venus striving on Ida suggests a more self-conscious figure putting her physical charms (and those of her garden) to use. Eve's whole performance, as Milton describes it, comes close to a display of primping, but the very ingenuousness and misplaced confidence which later cause trouble, here enhance her charm for the poet. When the latent dangers are about to become actual just before the fall, Milton echoes, expands and varies two of the pagan analogies: from her Husband's hand her hand Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light, Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Train, Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self In gait surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver arm'd, But with such Gard'ning Tools as Art yet rude, Guiltless of fire had form'd, or Angels Brought. To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorn'd, Likest she seem'd, Pomona when she fled Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. (IX.385-396) There is something comico-pathetic about the way her self 511</page><page sequence="30">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW deception is heightened by the substitution of rude garden ing tools for the goddess' noble weapons; having just as serted her "Virgin Majesty" and haughtily proclaimed herself above temptation, she emulates the virgin goddess but lacks both her divine immunity and her weapons. As the allusion to Ceres and Proserpina belies Eve's pose, so in the earlier passage Milton's reference to Mary and Raphael's salutation sounds the shallows of her cloistered condition, consciousness and virtue. The true Venerean pur pose is stated in "Mother of Mankind"—Venus Genetrix, not the Idaean goddess whose narcissism helps initiate the Trojan War. The serial change from virgin to mother will be transcended by the hortus conclusus of the second Eve, who is both at once. The fruitfulness of the garden becomes momentarily a figure of the fruitfulness of Eve, who in turn prefigures the fruitfulness of Mary. Yet if historical continu ity and typological development are suggested here, the ten sion between figure and fulfillment is just as clearly implied. The spatial enclosure and sensuous fullness of the paradisaic present, the ingenuous complacency and self sufficiency of the first Eve, stand in the way of the fullness of time. Everything in Milton's portrait of Eve so far points toward her resisting a fate which would involve expulsion, alienation and sacrifice—the only entry into the worlds of birth and rebirth. As William Madsen has put it: "Only by an act of sin that destroyed the Garden could the Garden come to be seen as a type of the spiritual life" ("Earth the Shadow of Heaven: Typological Symbolism in Paradise Lost," PMLA, vol. LXXV, no. 5, 524). In Book VIII (253-314) Milton has Adam make the fairly important yet often neglected point that he was not created in paradise but below in the plain of Eden. God takes him up the mountain from the wide earth to the narrow room of paradise, less for temporal or spatial prospect than for a life which is complete, self-enclosed and -contained, a life which does not need the rest of space and history. The experience in the garden is limited and repetitive: Adam and Eve do 512</page><page sequence="31">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING little else but celebrate God and Creation, make love, amuse themselves and tend plants. Surely Man as Gardener, Homo Horticultus, is not Milton's ideal imago Dei, and one senses throughout the poem a critique of the commonplace pas toral arguments against aspiration, a critique similar to those of Spenser, Shakespeare and Marvell. Thus Adam's second mountain ascent in Books XI and XII is presented as a con trast and corrective. There, under Michael's direction, he learns that God's presence is not "to these narrow bounds confin'd/ Of Paradise or Eden" (IX.341-342). The experi ence echoes that of Spenser's Redcross being enjoined by Contemplation to leave the Faerie he had been lost in and to return to history: only add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, Add Virtue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, By name to come call'd Charity, the soul Of all the rest: Then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess A paradise within thee, happier far. Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation; for the hour precise Exacts our parting.... (XII.581-590) It is time to leave the green world of sensuous and con templative fulfillment, time to justify withdrawal by a re turn to action. VI By the end of Book IV, of course, Milton is hardly ready to return to the tragic action of the Fall. He "withdraws" in a different way for four more books, the "large day" of dis course which moves in a parabola up to heaven and back down to earth. It is here that the issue of angelic perspective becomes central. The poet shifts from the naive imagining of III to a more sophisticated view because the dramatic situation embodied in the descent of Raphael allows him 513</page><page sequence="32">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW to place before us the problem of accommodating divine to human vision: Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate To human sense th' invisible exploits Of warring Spirits.... (V.564-566) Exploits derives from explicare: the invisible conflict will seem to unfold into visible warfare. The question Raphael subsequently asks will receive an implicitly affirmative an swer in the action of the sixth book: what surmounts the reach Of human sense, I shall delineate so, By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, As may express them best, though what if Earth Be but the shadow of Heav'n, and things therein Each to other like, more than on earth is thought? (V.57!-576) Later, when Michael and Satan are about to stop boasting and start fighting, Raphael seems less sanguine about the possibility of likeness: Unspeakable, for who though with the tongue Of Angels, can relate, or to what things Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seem'd, Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n. (VI.297-303) But the effect is actually to increase rather than diminish our sense of Heaven's earthliness: the things on earth to which Raphael likens the angels are the pagan images of divinity. Raphael is not saying, "How they transcend the reach of human sense!" but rather, "How immensely big and strong they are!" Here as everywhere in V and VI, the dif ference is one of degree, with the implication that heaven is 5*4</page><page sequence="33">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING only a bigger, better and slightly more rarefied version of earth, e.g.: Ev'ning now approach'd (For wee have also our ev'ning and our Morn, Wee ours for change delectable, not need).... (V.627-629) the face of brightest Heav'n had chang'd To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there In darker veil). .. . (V.644-646) darkness there might well Seem twilight here. . . . (VI. x 1-12) So under fiery Cope together rush'd Both Battles main, with ruinous assault And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n Resounded, and had Earth been then, all Earth Had to her Centre shook. What wonder? when Millions of fierce encount'ring Angels fought On either side, the least of whom could wield These elements, and arm him with the force Of all thir Regions. . . . (VI.215-223) (.. . Earth hath this variety from Heav'n Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) (VI.640-641) These explanations not only keep the semantic problem be fore us, they force on us a particular cosmological theory, so that when Raphael concludes, "Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth" (VI.893), we feel that the measurement has real and not merely rhetorical justification. Raphael has been describing levels of existence whose main difference is expressed in his choice of prepositions: in the fluid ethereal medium of Heaven, on the solid, compacted earth. The theory behind this view is not the cosmology of Paradise Lost, but one of a number of world-models which are put forward in sequence and according to dramatic necessity. The action of the poem is not to be construed as 515</page><page sequence="34">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW occurring in a particular universe but as creating and using cosmic ambients which symbolically manifest its phases. In Book III there is a gap, as it were a layer of insulation, be tween the spiritual and cosmic regions, and the latter is an inorganic or mechanical double of the former. The angels sing "in Heav'n, above the starry Sphere" while the "first convex" of the firm opacous Glove Of this round World . . . divides The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd From Chaos and th' inroad of Darkness old. . . . (III.416-421) This globe, we remember, was first depicted from Satan's viewpoint as hanging from a golden chain, while above it God was "Thron'd above all highth" and "About him all the Sanctities of Heaven/ Stood thick as Stars." The analogy is completed at III.577-587, when Milton describes the "golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven" Aloof the vulgar Constellations thick, That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, Dispenses Light from far; they as they move Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute Days, months and years, towards his all-cheering Lamp Turn swift their various motions, or are turn'd By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms The Universe, and to each inward part With gentle penetration, though unseen, Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep: So wondrously was set his Station bright. The last three lines but one echo two previous passages, the first connected with Satan's approach from Chaos and the second with Milton's plea for the holy—i.e., spiritual—light from God's "sovran vital Lamp": But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn. . . . (11.1034-1037) 516</page><page sequence="35">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING So much the rather thou Celestial light Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence Purge and disperse.... (III.51-54) On the one hand, Milton seems deliberately to conflate spiritual and physical light—at III.22-26, for example, he glides without warning from divine to visual light and from spiritual to physical blindness; the distinction between upper and inner worlds is blurred, while the poet asks for a sharper distinction between inner and outer worlds. On the other hand, although one process is carried through at all levels, there is a clear separation between the empyreal and physical orders; the latter resembles the former because the effect is so completely determined from the outside (from above) by its cause. There is something like a quantum jump be tween God and the cosmos that embodies his order in its mechanico-chemical intricacies. At the same time, as we have seen, the poet of Book III visualizes the empyreal world in a naively perceptual manner. In Book V the quantum-jump view is replaced by a Neo platonic image of existence as a vertical continuum. This cannot be taken as a mere amplification of the former view; it is a contradiction; the mechanistic and deterministic rela tion of spirit to matter is replaced by one which is organic and vitalistic: one Almighty is, from whom All things proceed, and up to him return, If not deprav'd from good, created all Such to perfection, one first matter all, Indu'd with various forms, various degrees Of substance, and in things that live, of life; But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, As nearer to him plac't or nearer tending Each in thir several active Spheres assign'd, Till body up to spirit work, in bounds Proportion'd to each kind. So from the root Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves More aery, last the bright consummate flow'r 517</page><page sequence="36">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Spirits odorous breathes: flow'rs and thir fruit Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, To intellectual, give both life and sense, Fancy and understanding, whence the Soul Reason receives, and reason is her being, Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, DifEering but in degree, of kind the same. (V.469-490) The context of this explanation affects its meaning. Raphael has assured Adam that human food is not "ingrateful" to angels, and part of his assurance consisted in describing the Great Chain as held together by cosmic digestion and as similation: food alike those pure Intelligential substances require As doth your Rational; and both contain Within them every lower faculty Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, And corporeal to incorporeal turn. For know, whatever was created, needs To be sustain'd and fed; of Elements The grosser feeds the purer, Earth the sea, Earth and the Sea feed Air, and Air those Fires Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon. . . . (V.407-418) The moon, Raphael continues, exhales nourishment to the higher orbs, the sun exchanges light for humid exhalations, "his alimental recompense," and though the menu in heaven is superb, yet God hath here Varied his bounty so with new delights, As may compare with Heaven; and to taste Think not I shall be nice.... (V.430-434) This leads Milton to a brief but admiring aside on the real (not illusory) appetite of angels and on the "concoctive 5i8</page><page sequence="37">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING heat" whereby their systems alchemically transmute waste matter to intellectual spirit. His next stage direction is turned by a pun into a comic exemplification of the process just described: Thus when with meats and drinks they had suffic'd Not burd'n'd Nature, sudden mind arose In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass Given him by his great Conference to know Of things above his World.... (V.451-455, italics mine) Dinner is thus the occasion, the model and even the cause of Raphael's Neoplatonic account, itself a refined and gen eralized version of the passage on digestion. Mind and mat ter, knowledge and appetite, spiritual and physical beings, angels, men and elements—all are parts of a single cosmic organism to whose functions they contribute. So far as rank and differentiation are concerned, the digestive model places emphasis less on various forms or various degrees of sub stance and life than on density and rarity: to be higher and better is primarily to be "more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure." Thus, as in the famous analogy of the flower ("So from the root . . . ," II.479-483, the so ambiguously meaning as and thus), any lower and perceptually more available object can give accurate information about objects above it on the scale and can, as pars pro toto, give accurate in formation about the whole process. As object it contributes to the life, and as symbol to the knowledge, of higher beings. The emphasis on the dense-to-rare continuum as the criterion of rank and diversity produces a corresponding emphasis on a unity ("one first matter all") which is more than analogical and which is attributed to Being, not merely to Thought. This entails two consequences: beings may be ontologically translated up or down the scale, a process which seems mainly to involve adjustment of the dense-rare proportion; and rational beings may learn about the Whole accurately and absolutely (while remaining in place) by contemplating its microcosmic reflection in themselves or in 519</page><page sequence="38">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW other available members of the continuum. These conse quences are drawn, the first by Raphael and the second by Adam, at the conclusion of the cosmological discourse: time may come when men With Angels may participate, and find No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: And from these corporal nutriments perhaps Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit, Improv'd by tract of time, and wing'd ascend Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; If ye be found obedient. . . . (V.493-501) O favourable spirit, propitious guest, Well has thou taught the way that might direct Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set From centre to circumference, whereon In contemplation of created things By steps we may ascend to God. (V.507-512) The Fall not only cancels the first possibility; it leads to a rearrangement of the universe which will greatly diminish the ease of access and intercourse between different ranks. Emphasis will shift from likeness to difference, and from difference in degree to difference in kind. Though Adam's statement of the familiar ladder theory of knowledge may still be valid, it will have to be reinterpreted—reinterpreted, that is, in the light of what follows, for Milton uses the theory in Books V and VI to make heaven a mere rarefied shadow of earth. VII Thus Milton's use of the Neoplatonic continuum in this part of the poem encourages a tendency to self-expansive optimism which will be checked and criticized in the second half. It may well be that he, like More, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, Marvell and others, intends to suggest the limits of that idyllic or green-world idealism associated with the Flo rentine Academy and its influence. At any rate, he uses it to 520</page><page sequence="39">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING support a deliberate move in the wrong direction, the move toward the war in heaven which—with the continuum in mind—we cannot but interpret as literal description. The very arrangement of episodes and topics in Books IV-VI en forces this movement, characterizing it as an anthropomor phic extension of ideal earthly experience to the realm of spirit. The poet's detailed and loving treatment of the dense earthly garden is recalled by numerous rarefied echoes in Raphael's account of heaven. The fifth book opens with an anticipation of the digestive continuum—note how the poet begins with a large-scale horticultural image and then moves up close to his subject: Now Morn her rosy steps in th' Eastern Clime Advancing, sow'd the Earth with Orient Pearl, When Adam wak't, so custom'd, for his sleep Was Aery light, from pure digestion bred, And temperate vapours bland. . . . Exhorting Eve to awake, he concludes his reference to the garden with an epitome of the process to be dilated through out the book until it embraces the whole world: Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, What drops the Myrrh, and what the balmy Reed, How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. (V.20-25) After this there is a pivotal movement from the cosmology of Book III to the continuum model. Adam's explanation of reason and fancy (V. 100-113) looks backward, both to the interrupted narrative of temptation in IV and to the quan tum-jump hierarchy of III, here extended to psychic facul ties. The two main points of transition are the hymn of Adam and Eve, and Raphael's descent from heaven. The hymn begins by distinguishing the Creator from his works and by echoing the description of angels in III: 521</page><page sequence="40">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Unspeakable, who sit'st above these Heavens To us invisible or dimly seen In these thy lowest works, yet these declare Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine. Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs And choral symphonies, Day without Night, Circle his Throne rejoicing, yee in Heav'n, On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. The analogy of stars and angels is then echoed, but here with a slight satanic tinge in the indirect reference to Lucifer: Fairest of Stars, last in the train of Night, If better thou belong not to the dawn, Sure pledge of day, that crown'st the smiling Morn With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Sphere.... (V.156-170) This is followed by praise of the "Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soul," the moon, the planets" that move/ In mystic Dance not without Song," and the elements, "the eldest birth/ Of Nature's Womb" which by metamorphosis describe their own "Perpetual Circle, multiform." The hints of personification (Sun and Nature) are broadened and sustained in the following apostrophes: Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise From Hill or steaming Lake, dusky or grey, Till the Sun paint your fleecy skirts with Gold, In honour to the World's great Author rise, Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolour'd sky, Or wet the thirsty Earth with falling showers, Rising or falling still advance his praise. His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. Join voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend (V.185-198) 522</page><page sequence="41">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING This image of an animate universe is produced by transfer of terms from soul to world, and the first part may remind one of Satan at Eve's ear trying "to reach/ The Organs of her Fancy," to see if, inspiring venom, he might taint Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise At least distemper'd, discontented thoughts. . . . (IV.804-807) But apart from such particular echoes, the entire process embodied in the hymn suggests how the human soul (Ficino's nodus et vinculum mundi) binds together the unspeakable and the mute levels of existence by treating them all on the model of organic human activity. The seen and the unseen are linked through words; the images of physical and visible nature are made to bespeak God in being converted to symbols or changed by metaphoric attribution. Thus a growing fluidity characterizes the relations of upper to lower and inner to outer as we approach the visit of Raphael and the interpenetration of angelic and human sensibilities. Raphael's descent is visualized in a passage in which Mil ton has heightened "the demonic insidiousness of his lan guage," to borrow a phrase from Thomas Greene's brilliant interpretation of V.219-300 in The Descent from Heaven. As Greene shows, the murky syntax and imagery of the pas sage enforce the distinction between Raphael's clear and our obscure vision. But we should remember that our in cludes the fallen poet's vision and that a reflexive analogy may lurk in the analogues of Galileo and the pilot: As when by night the Glass Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes Imagin'd Lands and Regions in the Moon: Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades Delos or Samos first appearing kens A cloudy spot. (V.261-266) The earlier Galileo references sharpen the analogy: Satan's 523</page><page sequence="42">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW shield, described as he is about to set up his domain on the "shore" of Hell, is compared to the moon, "whose Orb" Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole, Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. (1.288-291) At III.588-590, Satan landing on the sun is described as a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orb Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. There is of course the implied danger of merely physical or scientific exploration in a universe whose essential charac ter is moral. More relevant is the danger of projecting from the near to the remote, from the familiar to the unfamiliar, in such a way as to extend the limited categories of fallen human experience to an area which may indeed be quite different from or transcendent of these categories. Galileo imagined lands and regions; he viewed the moon to descry— in order to descry?—new lands, rivers or mountains (the or suggests that he is looking for something familiar, though he is not certain what he will find). Thus peopled by human conjucture, the new regions may remain unknown; thus leading our fantasy into possibly false surmises, spiritual powers may hide their true natures from us. As Satan col onizes hell, and Galileo the moon, perhaps also Milton colonizes—or is about to colonize—heaven. For Milton too is an explorer: if, looking through his glass, he brings heaven and the angel nearer so that they can be seen more clearly, he also allows us to wonder whether anthropomor phic preconceptions do not travel in the other direction, from mind through eye and glass to heaven. I think he may want us to entertain the possibility that the necessary limit expressed in the phrase in aenigmate is not being honored as it should. 524</page><page sequence="43">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING There is no apparent difference between Raphael as de scribed in heaven and on earth, though at two points Mil ton's rhetorical shifts tend to smoke the edges of the figure. The first is Raphael's departure: nor delay'd the winged Saint After his charge receiv'd; but from among Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood Veil'd with his gorgeous wings, up springing light Flew through the midst of Heav'n. . . . (V.247-251) Partly because of the image suggested by Ardors, partly be cause of the way the penultimate line delays yet leans on the final phrase, light seems momentarily to function as a noun, the subject of Flew. As in the sentence, so in the image, the angelic form is briefly blurred; this baroque touch con veys not only sudden speed and power, it also dematerial izes and dehumanizes the form. The second and more puz zling passage first compares Raphael to the phoenix—"to all the Fowls he seems/ A Phoenix" (V.271-272)—"He lights, and to his proper shape returns/ A Seraph wing'd" (V.276-277). It is as if the appearance, the simile, has be come the reality. The poet moves from a tentative and con jectural to a definite literal description. The angelic form, once flickering and blurred because of the way it was visual ized, now appears solid and more precisely human in detail. At the same time it is more artificial—more painted, as it were—and symbolic: six wings he wore, to shade His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast With regal Ornament; the middle pair Girt like a Starry Zone his waist, and round Skirted his loins and thighs with downy Gold And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet Shadow'd from either heel with feather'd mail Sky-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood, And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance fill'd The circuit wide. (V.277-287) 525</page><page sequence="44">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Shade means both to conceal and to figure forth: what seem to be concealed are simply the "lineaments Divine" of his human body. What is figured forth, on the other hand, is the hierarchic universe: the upper pair of wings manifests the regal ornament suggestive of Raphael's rank and his relation to God; the middle pair connotes the higher re gion of the heavens associated with fixed stars, while the third pair seems to indicate the lower region of the sky oc cupied by birds. As Milton describes him he becomes not only more human but more pagan in his heroic quality, and by the time we get to his winged feet we are prepared for the reference to Hermes. Perhaps we are expected to think that the pagan image of the heavenly messenger was a dis torted version of this "real" angel. But perhaps we are also to remember Milton's classical sources—perhaps, that is, the allusion is to the process of borrowing and imitating—and take note of the fact that the poet has reverted to an older mode of visualization. Hermes, at any rate, means and is the interpreter, and Raphael descending on a hermetic mission bears the upper reaches of the universe in proprio persona and makes them available to Adam in the garden. The descent is thus a dramatic symbol of and prelude to the lowering of heaven and the anthropomorphic mingling of divine and earthly orders which is about to unfold in the continuum model and in the war in heaven. And the scene which follows the descent reveals how that process is rooted in the dense, compact earthly center of the garden, within the idyllic context of dinner and infinite leisure— the process is rooted here and in expanding outward it carries the garden imagery with it. The angel wanders through the chaotic plenty of the green world, "A Wilder ness of sweets" which expresses Eve as well as Nature: Nature here Wanton'd as in her prime, and play'd at will Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, Wild above Rule or Art, enormous bliss. (V.294-297) 526</page><page sequence="45">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING The sun "Shot down direct his fervid Rays, to warm/ Earth's inmost womb" (V.300-301) while, as Adam remarks, Nature multiplies Her fertile growth, and by disburd'ning grows More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. (V.318-320) Eve's response concludes with the leitmotif which will echo throughout the ensuing narrative: Adam, earth's hallow'd mould, Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; Save what by frugal storing firmness gains To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: But I will haste and from each bough and brake, Each Plant and juiciest Gourd will pluck such choice To entertain our Angel guest, as hee Beholding shall confess that here on Earth God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. (V.321-330) We should remember that the premise underlying this sen timent as well as the entire angelic narrative through Book VI has already been introduced in an episode which qualifies them from the start: Eve's evil dream (V.28-93). Though the dream makes her uncomfortable, its influence malingers. The magical idea that total knowledge, experience, and power can be gained by eating is echoed in the assumption that it can be gained while eating and extends further in the notion that it can be embraced on the model of nourish ment. At one point in her dreams, Eve remembers, Forthwith up to the Clouds With him I flew, and underneath beheld The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide And various. . . . (V.86-89) A version of this experience is vicariously imitated through 527</page><page sequence="46">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW the medium of angelic disclosure in Books V-VIII, but with this central difference: Raphael's account describes a parabola which crests at Book VI and arcs downward in VII and VIII; earthly categories are "outstretcht immense" until they embrace heaven, but are retracted in VII. Eve's sudden fall, when her guide abandons her (V.90-92), is in contrast to the controlled descent of Milton's angelic dis course. The apogee of the discourse is the appearance and tri umph of the Son, who is presented not as the self-sacrificing Saviour but as a Jovian Messiah. Here Milton conflates He braic and pagan modes of imagination—Ezekiel's vision ap plied to Messiah's chariot and the warrior-god accoutred with an eagle-winged Victory, a bow and arrows, and thun derbolts—to produce a distinctly archaic episode, marked by two noteworthy characteristics: 1) after the visionary and symbolic aspects are stressed, Milton puts them literally into play as military functions. In Ezekiel, the vision grad ually materializes through the first chapter, it never crys tallizes into a definite chariot-image; the element of visionary appearance is always kept before us ("the appearance of the likeness of the glory of God"); and the total image, which serves only as a prelude to God's spirit entering the prophet, is left behind, to be restated among other symbolic visions (ch. 10). While Milton encourages us to think of this context, he immediately de-sophisticates the vision by applying it to an object which, however mystical, is real enough to hold a passenger, and which is located in a pre cise narrative situation requiring literal activity: the third sacred Morn began to shine Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirl-wind sound The Chariot of Paternal Deity, Flashing thick flames, Wheel within wheel, undrawn, Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoy'd By four Cherubic shapes.. . . (V.748-753) The Messiah is crowded into his chariot along with a va 528</page><page sequence="47">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING riety of objects which seem at first to symbolize attributes, but which subsequently harden into useful implements after Raphael makes it quite clear that he is picturing the event as it occurred: Hee in Celestial Panoply all arm'd Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, Ascended, at his right hand Victory Sat Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, And from about him fierce Effusion roll'd Of smoke and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, He onward came, far off his coming shone, And twenty thousand (I thir number heard) Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen. ... At once the Four spread out thir Starry wings With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbs Of his fierce Chariot roll'd, as with the sound Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove Gloomy as Night; under his burning Wheels The steadfast Empyrean shook throughout, All but the Throne itself of God. Full soon Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand Grasping ten thousand thousand Thunders, which he sent Before him, such as in thir Souls infix'd Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, All courage; down thir idle weapons dropp'd; O'er Shields and Helms, and helmed heads he rode.... (VI.760-770, 827-840, italics mine) As in the description of Raphael descending, the shift from scriptural to pagan imagery, and from rough to precise notation, converts transcendent vision into the kind of heroic image which would appeal to a child: the wheels make a whirring noise, the ground shakes, the angelic victims have not only helms but helmed heads. 2) If the apocalyptic connotations are retained, they serve another purpose which is suggested in William Madsen's 529</page><page sequence="48">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW statement that "Raphael's account is not a moral allegory, nor is it primarily a metaphorical description of what hap pened a long time ago in heaven. It is a shadow of things to come, and more particularly it is a shadow of this last age of the world and of the Second Coming of Christ" (loc. cit., p. 525). Madsen, however, reads this as a serious typo logical prophecy, whereas I think it is one of a number of wish-fulfilling moments which give the sixth book its pri mary character. In looking simultaneously back to the Old Testament and forward to the Second Coming, Raphael's overview suggests the same kind of circular time-abolishing vision as that produced by the narrative arrangement of the first six books. The vision in fact overleaps the "shadow of this last age" to resolve all problems in the finality of the Happy Ending. Both the millennial quality of the vision and its historical limitations are suggested in Milton's use of the name Messiah. The physical violence of Messiah's triumph, the forceful projection and separation of good and evil into two armies, the single encounter which resolves all diffi culties, the irrevocable exorcism whereby Heaven is easily "disburd'n'd"—all this suggests the play of an imagination impatient of actual conditions, giving vent to Utopian im pulses, vicariously chastizing evil and concluding with a great visionary sigh of relief: Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes Messiah his triumphal Chariot turn'd: To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood Eye-witnesses of his Almighty Acts, With Jubilee advanc'd; and as they went, Shaded with branching Palm, each order bright, Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts And Temple of his mighty Father Thron'd On high; who into Glory him receiv'd, Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. (VI.880-892) All that remains—an anti-climax, perhaps, from the heav 530</page><page sequence="49">PARADISE LOST EVOLVING enly perspective in terms of which the final triumph is sure and recurrently foreshadowed both in history and in Para dise Lost—all that remains is the sum total of human vicis situde. In the closing verse paragraph of Book VI, Raphael frames the Messiah's blissful now in the other blissful now of the garden discourse, reminds Adam of the trouble ahead and thereby reminds us that the poem is but half complete. As I suggested above, we might see this performance as a critical staging by Milton of his own youthful optimism, as well as an enactment of an imaginative mode indigenous to an older time, the youth of civilization. It is a necessary phase of consciousness which must be experienced in order to be understood, must be given its head in order to be con trolled and transcended. Madsen suggests this but does not draw the proper conclusion: . . . when Abdiel's "noble stroke" sent Satan back recoiling, one can imagine the youthful Milton in the very forefront of the angelic host, filled with "Presage of Victory and fierce desire/ Of Battle" . , ., just as he had been in the forefront of those who saw in the Puritan Revolution a presage of the Millennium. But Abdiel was wrong: his reason did not over come Satan's might, and the first blow struck against evil did not end the war. From the reader's point of view the outcome of the struggle is never in doubt because he is privileged to see it under the aspect of eternity. (loc. cit., p. 526) To see it under that aspect is clearly, for Milton, the easy way out; what really matters to him is not the heavenly war and the angelic vision, but the much more limited and embattled prospect of the human and historical present. For the concrete individual, the outcome is in doubt, and Mil ton's appeals to the larger view, the divine plane of events, seem largely to function as moments of temporary escape, relief, clarification of issues, unguarded optimism or impa tience with limited mortal solutions. If, as Madsen states, "the principal lesson that Raphael's narrative inculcates is the lesson of patience" (p. 525), this is clearly a lesson which is shown to apply to the speaker himself as well as to Adam. 531</page></plain_text>
