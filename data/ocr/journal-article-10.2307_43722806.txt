Paper SKr 192. The main goal of Mettinger's book is to provide a comparative study of Israelite and other ancient Near Eastern aniconism. M. tells us when he finds the use of the word "aniconism" appropriate: "I shall thus use the term 'aniconism' as referring to cults where there is no iconic representation of the deity (anthropomorphic or therio- morphic) serving as the dominant or central cultic symbol" (p. 19). He further dis- tinguishes between "empty-space aniconism" and "material aniconism," the latter indicating the use of a cultic object without a portrait of the deity to represent the deity. Noting that statues were often taken as booty in the ancient world, M. empha- sizes the aniconic role of standing stones in the cults he examines. Having laid this groundwork, M. attempts to find evidence of aniconic cults among the neighbors of ancient Israel. Mesopotamia and Egypt are the focus of the second chapter. Both cultures are obviously iconically inclined; possible exceptions are found in the cults of Ashur in Mesopotamia and of Aten and Amun in Egypt. The Nabateans, admittedly later than much of the OT period, next draw M.'s attention. Standing stones appear in the Nabatean cult, causing M. to consider the origins of this aniconic practice. In his next chapter he considers pre-Islamic Arabia</page><page sequence="2">720 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 58, 1996 as a possible place of origin for Nabatean aniconism. Here again he finds standing stones, although the evidence is admittedly scanty, and, therefore, supposes a pre- Islamic aniconism. The Phoenician-Punic world is the subject of chap. 5. Here the difficulty is syncre- tism of West Semitic and Greek cults. There are iconic elements in the Phoenician cults, M. admits, but the cults of Paphos, Emesa, Carmel, and Gades he labels " 'expli- citly' aniconic" (p. 84). He also finds evidence for aniconic cults in Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, and Hierapolis, and in the Punic stelae. Continuing the Syrian search in the next chapter, he explores Bronze-Age Syrian cities and the Anatolian huwaši stones. The Syrian cities Mari, Ebla, Qatna, Emar, Ugarit, and Byblos all yield some evidence of aniconism, as do the huwaši stones. M. then discusses etymological issues associ- ated with various words for standing stones in the ancient world. In the final and longest chapter M. deals with Israelite aniconism. Paying special attention to the Iron Age, he attempts to find the provenance of aniconic practices prior to the programmatic prohibition of images in Israel's cult. After looking for external influence on the Israelite cult he turns to a consideration of cultic massêbôt in Israel. Citing the archaeological criteria for a cultic context, M. examines Iron Age Arad, Lachish, Beth-shemesh, the "Bull Site," Tirzah, Megiddo, Taanach, and Tel Dan for standing stones. For the origin of this cult, he considers cultic massêbôt in the Uvda Valley and Timna in the Negev, and in various Bronze-Age sites in Palestine (Meggido, Hazor, Hartuv, Tel Kitan, Tell el-Hayyat, Gezer, Shechem, Nahariya, and Beth-shan). M. concludes that Israelite aniconism was part of a wider West Semitic aniconism. As such, it is as old as Israel itself, but it is not distinctively Israelite. Mettinger's study is useful in bringing together evidence from various cultures to compare with Israel's prohibition of images. His definition of aniconism, however, is broad, and throughout the book a question of its adequacy remains. His definition of aniconism does not require a prohibition of images. His arguments limit all gods to human or animal form. His definition also insists that iconic representations of the deity only matter when they are the central cultic image; thus, the other imagery of Solomon's temple is aniconic. With this definition of aniconism and the sporadic finds of archaeology the case is almost closed before it is opened. There is an intrinsic difficulty in studying the absence of a phenomenon (images), which leads to many arguments from silence. Although M. gives many examples of iconic and supposedly aniconic cults side by side, he does not explore thoroughly the implications of such a juxtaposition. Much of his evidence is from cultures later than that of ancient Israel. Standing stones cannot always be assumed to be representations of deities, as M. suggests. He does not discuss other interpretations of such stones in any detail. In short, M. has provided a handy collation of cults involving standing stones and missing images. His attempt to demonstrate that West Semitic cults tended to be aniconic suffers, however, from his definition of the term and from a lack of adequate evidence. Steve A.
