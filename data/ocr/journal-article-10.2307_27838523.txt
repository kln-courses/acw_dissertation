<plain_text><page sequence="1">RIVERS By LUNA . LEOPOLD Rivers are both the means and the routes by which the products of continental weathering are carried to the oceans of the world. Except in the most arid areas more water falls as precipitation than is lost by evaporation and transpiration from the land surface to the atmosphere. Thus there is an excess of water, which must flow to the ocean. Rivers, then, are the routes by which this excess water flows to the ultimate base level. The excess of precipitation over evaporation and transpiration provides the flow of rivers and springs, recharges ground water storage, and is the supply from which man draws water for his needs. The excess of precipitation over evapo-transpiration losses to the atmosphere is a surprisingly small percentage of the average precipita tion. The average amount of water that falls as precipitation over the United States annually is 30 inches. Of this total fall, 21 inches are returned to the atmosphere in the form of water vapor through processes of evaporation and transpiration from plants. The balance of 9 inches represents that excess which contributes to the flow of rivers. Interestingly, about 40 per cent of the runoff from continental United States is carried by the Mississippi River alone. Deep seepage from ground water to the ocean is not known, but it is believed to be quite small, probably much less than 0.1 inch per year. It will be noted that for the land area of the continent the water cycle balances: credit, 30 inches of precipitation; debit, 9 inches of runoff plus 21 inches transferred to the atmosphere. However, looking at the atmos phere the budget appears out of balance because 30 inches are delivered to the land as rain and snow but only 21 inches as vapor are received back by evaporation and transpiration. This means that 9 inches of moisture are transported from the oceans to the continent to balance the discharge of rivers to the sea. It is estimated that each year the atmos phere brings about 150 inches from the oceans over the land area of the United States and carries back 141 inches. A good deal of the water which appears as river flow is not transmitted into the river channels immediately after falling as precipitation. A large percentage of the fall is infiltrated into the ground and flows underground to the river channels. This provides, then, a form of storage or regulation that sustains the flow of streams during non-storm or dry periods. When one observes water flowing in a creek or river during periods of bright sunny weather it is obvious that this discharge represents water that had fallen during previous storm periods and had been stored in the rocks and in the soil materials of the drainage basin. 511</page><page sequence="2">512 american scientist The 9 inches of average annual runoff of rivers of the United States amounts to a very large amount of water. If it could be visualized as a uniform flow during the whole year, which in reality it is not, it would amount to 1.4 1011 gallons per day. In fact, runoff is highly erratic in time and in geographic distribution. For large areas in the United States an important percentage of the total flow occurs during the late spring and early summer, the period during which the water which had been accumulating during the winter as snow appears as melt-water runoff. Though the amount of water carried off the continent to the oceans each year is large, so also is the total length of stream channels. The writer has estimated that the total length of river channel in the United States, including all the minor creeks and draws, amounts to about 3,000,000 miles.

I shall limit this paper to a description of the form of rivers and river systems. The three million miles of stream channels in the United States vary widely in size and occur in a wide variety of topographic and geologic circumstances. Included in this figure of total length are those high mountain streams epitomizing wilderness beauty, the dirty and trash filled channels too often coursing through our cities, and the majestic but turbid large rivers flowing in wide valleys of central United States and the flat expanses of the coastal plain. One might suppose then, from the variety of geographic and geologic environments through which these channels are carved, that there would exist such a variety of river types that but little could be said about river characteristics in general. Each geographic situation might be supposed to have its own special kind of river and each would be a law unto itself.

There is not only unity displayed by important similarities between rivers in different settings, but also an amazing organization of river systems. This in part results from a delicate balance between the forces of erosion and the forces of resistance. The characteristics of river systems which can be used to demonstrate the unity among forms fall under three general categories, the river channel, the river valley, and the drainage net?the term applied to the system of branching channels ramifying to the smallest tributaries. The first and most important aspect of the river channel is that it is self-formed and self-maintained. The flowing water carves the groove in which it flows. The water fashions the depth, the cross section, the areal configuration, and the longitudinal profile. Existing river channels have had a history in many respects analogous to the history of a species in the biological world. An existing river is inherited from an earlier one, which in turn was derived from a still earlier progenitor. The sequence extends backward to that time when the continental area now being drained by the river was once under the ocean. Thus the river channel usually cannot be spoken of as having been formed, in that no particular time or place of origin of a given river can be specified. Rather, it is best to think that a river has evolved through geologic time, and that the processes of change that may be observed at present are indeed the same processes by which this evolution took place. The changes during the river history in geologic time were brought about by changes in the external conditions, such as a change in climate (including glaciation), a change in elevation of the continental mass and the concomitant changes in vegetation, in rates and types of weathering, and in the amounts and kinds of materials flowing under the influence of gravity toward base-level?the ocean. The forces involved in shaping and maintaining the channel are related to the fluid flow. The flow of the fluid exerts a shear on both bed and bank and it is this shear which causes particles comprising the bed and bank to be moved along in traction by the water, that is, by pushing, rolling, and skipping. This portion of the debris in transport is referred to as the bedload. The same shear creates the turbulent eddies in the flowing fluid which entrains some particles of matter and throws them up into the main mass of the fluid, thus carrying them as the suspended load. The transport of sediment debris by rivers to the oceans is a phenom enon known to everyone. It is far less well known that the quantity of dissolved materials carried by rivers to the ocean is also very large. Because the transport process is not visually evident, nor are deposits of</page><page sequence="7">RIVERS 517 dissolved materials obvious, it is hard to visualize that slightly more than half of all the materials carried by river water from continent to ocean is carried as dissolved load. This fact was quantitatively verified in results recently published by Durum, Heidel, and Tison, describing an inter national project designed to sample the dissolved load of the great rivers of the world. Fluid shear shapes the river channel. It can be visualized in a general way that if a channel were very deep and very narrow there would be far more shearing action on the channel sides than on the channel bed. It seems logical that, as a result, there would be a tendency in such a channel for erosion to take place along the banks, whereas along the bed there would be a tendency for insufficient shear to carry along the eroded material. Such a channel would widen and become shallower. An opposite extreme can be visualized, in which a channel were very wide and shallow. The great expanse of bed exposed to the shearing ac tion of the flow would tend to erode and thus degrade the bed, establish ing in time a channel of more modest breadth but greater depth. Indeed, some such action does take place, for the width-depth ratios of rivers of comparable size have a great consistency. If the shearing force on the channel banks is sufficient to overcome the cohesion of the bank materials, erosion takes place, and the eroded particles are swept away from their original position and become a part of the bed materials, there either to be moved or temporarily lodged. On the stream bed, scour takes place when the shear exceeds some critical value, and this occurs during relatively high flow. At low flow it is usual for the shearing forces on the bed to be sufficiently small that the bed materials do not move. Scour, then, occurs primarily during high dis charges. The relatively long time periods represented by modest and low flow are periods of but little movement of bed material. A river increases downstream in size owing to the increase of drainage area as tributaries enter. This increase in size is manifested not only in the amount of water (discharge) but also by an increase in channel width and depth. To accommodate an increase in discharge resulting from tributary entrance, the channel may enlarge in width or in depth, or the increased flow could be achieved by an increase in flow velocity. Because discharge (cubic feet per second) is the product of cross-sectional area times velocity Q ? av and area is the width times depth Q = wdv an increase in discharge may be accommodated by an increase in any of these three factors, or by some combination of them.</page><page sequence="8">518 AMERICAN SCIENTIST In actuality, the increase is nearly always divided among these three parameters in the same way.

The parallelism of lines in each of the plots shows that the rates of increase with discharge are similar among the various rivers. Width increases downstream faster than depth, and depth faster than velocity, the latter being very nearly constant along the river length. The increase in width-to-depth ratio can be seen in Figure 3, in which cross sections of five channels are drawn with no exaggeration in</page><page sequence="9">RIVERS 519 vertical scale but at different scales so that the widths appear equal on the printed page. In actuality the creek represented in the upper sketch has a width of only 24 feet whereas the river in the lower sketch is a large river having a width of 1153 feet. It had long been supposed that the speed of water in a river decreased downstream. This supposition was based on the fact that river slope decreases downstream and, generally speaking, the size of bed material also decreases from boulders or cobbles in the headwaters to sand, silt, or clay in the downstream portions of large rivers. It had long been argued, without reference to measurement data, that the supposed downstream decrease in water velocity was causally related to the inability of a river to carry coarse material at the flat gradient existing in downstream Watts Branch, Md.

Mountain creeks appear to flow more swiftly than the deep water of large rivers, but the appearance of flowing water is a test rather of kineticity than of flow speed. When my colleagues and I showed by measurement data that, in fact, velocity tends to increase or remain constant downstream in most rivers, a new rationale was needed to explain the observed relationships. It now appears that the constancy or slight increase of velocity down stream results from the fact that river depth increases faster than river slope decreases. But this still does not explain how the requisite changes are divided among the pertinent parameters, nor why this division is so</page><page sequence="10">520 AMERICAN SCIENTIST nearly the same in all rivers regardless of size or physiographic setting. This division turns out to be that which most nearly causes entropy to increase equally in each unit of length along the river as will be mentioned later. That river channels should display such unity as exists is even more surprising as one inquires into the many changes that occur between low flow and high or flood flow. Channel scour during high discharge is an example. Though not universal, it is usual for the bed of a river channel to erode or temporarily to scour during floods, and as the flood recedes, to redeposit an approximately equal amount of material. The depth of bed scour may in some channels be as much as half the value of the increase in the elevation of the water surface. Thus if the water surface elevation increases, say 10 feet, above the level at low flow, the water depth at that high stage may well be increased not merely 10 feet but 15 feet. Figure 4 is an example. The passage of the high flow during the spring snow melt of 1956 past the measurement station on the Colorado River at Lees Ferry resulted at peak flow in an increase in water surface elevation of 8.2 feet but a concomitant scour of 4.8 feet. The bed elevation at the end of the high flow was within 0.5 foot of that existing before the event. This return to a condition so nearly identical to that existing before the passage of the high flow implies a tendency for the maintenance, on the average, of a condition of dynamic equilibrium of an extremely sensitive nature. Scour tends to be balanced by fill on the average. Such a dynamic equilibrium between erosion and deposition depends on the operation of checks and balances the elucidation of which is essential to the understanding of river behavior. The basic mechanics of scour and fill, as exemplified in Figure 4, are still only imperfectly understood. One of the most important concepts, recently developed by Bagnold, may elucidate the point. Many rivers flow over deep deposits of relatively uniform material. Recognizing that the fluid shear on the granular bed material tends to increase with increased discharge, a threshold shear may be postulated at which the bed material will begin to move. When this threshold is reached a layer of grains at the surface of the streambed is peeled off and put into motion downstream. Owing to the fact that there is a consider able depth of similar granular material in the bed, it might be supposed that the shear capable of peeling off the top layer of grains would be similarly capable of peeling off the next layer of identical grains, and the next, ad infinitum. In reality, this does not happen, and for any given value of shear only a finite thickness of grains is set in motion. Continued application of the same shear does not result in further erosion and, instead, a temporary quasi-equilibrium exists. The transport of grains actually changes the forces within the fluid in such a manner that con tinued erosion of the bed becomes impossible.</page><page sequence="11">Colorado River at Lees Ferry, Arizona Water Year 1956 (a) Low to High Flow (b) High to Low Flow 0 100 200 300 400 0 100 200 300 400 ^ to DISTANCE, IN FEET DISTANCE, IN FEET ^ Fig. 4.

This downward force results from grain collision during transport. Collisions between grains tend to knock an individual grain in a direction that may be forward, up, or down. There will be enough grains directed downward against the bed actually to create a downward stress which tends to prevent further erosion of bed grains. Until Bagnold's work, it had not been recognized that hydraulic relations developed for clear water would not apply directly to water carrying a debris load. The forces within a fluid are altered by the trans port of sediment debris. Knowledge of sediment transport and its relation to river hydraulics has been slow to develop, both in theory and in practice, owing to the fact that it is still impossible to make consistent and accurate measure ments of the amounts of debris being transported as bedload in natural rivers. Instruments have long been in use that measured adequately the sediment being transported in suspension, but bedload, being concen trated in a thin zone near the stream bottom, is interrupted by the insertion of any obstacle, no matter how streamlined. The insertion of a sampling device at the stream bed changes the conditions of transport locally in such a manner that a representative sample of the bedload in transport is impossible. Though rates of bedload transport can be suc cessfully measured in experimental flumes, the conditions represented in the laboratory are much more limited than those extant in the field. Water discharge in a river fluctuates widely from year to year, season to season, and day to day. Thus the forces governing erosion and depo sition are highly variable. The channel flows at shallow depth most of the time and is filled to the top of the banks relatively seldom. On still less frequent occasions, the discharge exceeds the channel capacity and flows overbank. An overbank flow is a flood by definition. Recently it was shown that the frequency of the bankfull condition is surprisingly uni form among rivers in diverse settings and among rivers of widely different size. The bankfull stage may be expected on the average about once a year to once in two years. To state this in another way so that the practical application is ap parent, the river channel is large enough to accommodate all the water coming from the drainage area only in the relatively frequent event. The flat area bordering most channels?the flood plain?must flood to some extent on the average every other year. To overflow the flood plain is an inherent characteristic of a river. It has been surmised that channel formation and maintenance are accomplished primarily during periods of flood flow. This would seem to follow from the general observation that many of the most obvious</page><page sequence="13">, , - ?i ! - ?-r?- - \ -EXPLANATION / Meanders of rivers and Y in flumes Y 100,000- x -,--y--?-1 11/1 [100,000 _Meanders of Gulf Stream__ , _ o pP O 9? o ?

To the extent this were true, it would be inferred that the events most worthy of study in attempting to isolate the general controlling principles would be extraordinary occurrences. As recently as 1960, Wolman and Miller introduced another conception that has had an impact on thinking about rivers and, indeed, alters the view of the action of geomorphic processes in general. The principal work in fashioning landscape forms is not done during the frequent event or the predominant condition because the processes acting are incompe tent to have any significant effect. Nor is the principal work accomplished by the very effective but very rare event?the catastrophic incident. Rather, it appears that the landscape is fashioned primarily by the event of intermediate frequency and effectiveness. For example, the total sediment load transported by a river past a given point over a period of time is the sum of the amount transported during a variety of flow events; that is, during many days of low flow, a modest number of days of intermediate flows, and a decreasing number of increasingly great floods. The data indicate that the intermediate flows have a cumulative significance far greater than those of either greater or smaller magnitude, because the product of effectiveness times frequency is greatest. This concept is a fundamental contribution to thinking about landscape moulding processes. There are other attributes of river channels which also demonstrate the unity that exists among channels, even channels widely different in size. Nearly all natural channels are sinuous to some extent. Indeed, natural channels are rarely straight for a distance greater than ten channel widths. Not only do channels exhibit a more or less regular aspect of sinuosity, but also the size of the curves assumed by a channel bear a constant relationship to the channel itself. Small channels wind in small curves and large channels in large curves. Measurement data show that there is quite a constant relationship between channel width and the radius of the curves which the channel exhibits. Also, the meander length or wave length is generally propor tional to channel width. These characteristics can be seen on Figure 5, where the meander length is plotted separately against channel width and against the mean radius of curvature. It can be seen that there is essentially a linear relationship between the wave length of the channel curves, channel width, and the radius of curvature. This linear relation occurs not only in most natural rivers but also to meltwater channels developed on the surface of a glacier and in the flow path of the gulf stream which is not confined by channel banks. The consistency of the relation of radius of curvature to channel width is indicated by the following measurement data. In a sample of 50</page><page sequence="15">RIVERS 525 Fig. 6. Planimetrie map of a meander bend on each of three rivers varying greatly in size; scaled so that meander length is equal on the printed page.</page><page sequence="16">526 AMERICAN SCIENTIST rivers of various sizes the median value of the ratio of curvature divided by width was 2.7, the mean 3.1, and two-thirds of the cases occurred between the values of 1.5 and 4.3. The tendency for a constant ratio of radius to width makes all rivers look quite similar on planimetrie maps, as is suggested by Figure 6. In fact, when one inspects a plani metrie map of a river without first glancing at the map scale, it is not immediately obvious whether the river is large or small owing to this tendency for a similar ratio of radius to width. When the sinuous bends of a river are relatively symmetrical the channel is said to be meandering. Such a large variation in degree of sinuosity exists in natural channels that the definition of a meandering stream?in contrast with one which is merely sinuous?becomes a matter of arbitrary definition. There is represented in nature, then, an unbroken continuum between slightly wavy channels and well developed meanders which can assume the form of horseshoe loops. Owing to the fact that the meandering character of river channels has long been considered to be associated in basic mechanics with the movement of sediment, the observation that sediment-free channels carved by melt water on the surface of a glacier can also meander is of considerable interest. Tentatively, the mechanical principles resulting in the meander ing form of meltwater channels in the absence of sediment load and those causing the meandering of rivers are probably the same. The similarity in channel form implies that the basic cause is essentially hydrodynamic, rather than a direct result of bank erosion and the lateral transfer of sediment across the channel. The mechanics of a meandering channel are by no means well under stood. Certain physical characteristics have been known for a long time but the basic mechanism is still elusive. Measurements made in meander ing streams and in curved flumes allow the construction of a generalized picture of the flow pattern in a meander which is presented in simplified form in Figure 7. The isometric view of the two principal components of velocity at various positions in the bend show the main features. The scale of the sketch is such that the super-elevation of the water surface in the bend does not show in the diagrams but is implied in the velocity distribution. The velocity in a meander crossover, or point of inflection, is not symmetrically distributed. As would be expected, proceeding down stream from the axis of the bend the thread of maximum velocity is much closer to the concave bank than to the center of the channel. The high velocity, moreover, continues to hug this side through the point of in flection of the curve. At least in narrow channels, a cross-channel velocity component is directed toward the convex bank (usually called the point bar) near the bed and toward the concave bank near the surface. Continuity requires, then, that surface water plunge downward near</page><page sequence="17">RIVERS 527 5 Generalized velocity distribution Fig. 7.

This circulatory motion in the cross-sectional plane of a channel was first observed and explained by Thomson in 1879. It results from the larger centrifugal force on fast-moving surface parcels than on slower-moving ones near the bed. The motion gives to an individual water parcel a path resembling a helix. As a result of this circulatory motion, material at the bed tends to be swept toward the convex bank, thus to be deposited in part on the point bar. The accretion of material on the point bar gradually pushes the convex bank into the channel and this tendency is compensated by a tendency for erosion of the concave bank. Thus, it is usual for a river channel gradually to migrate laterally across the valley floor. During such lateral migration the channel width remains the same. An example of the build ing of the point bar balanced by bank erosion on the opposite side of the stream is demonstrated by a series of observations made on Watts Branch, a small stream near Washington, D.C., for which the cross sections during a period of nine years are presented in Figure 8. The manner in which a channel moves across the valley floor, eroding one bank and building a nearly flat flood plain on the other, all the while maintaining a cross section similar in shape and size, is another aspect of the dynamic equilibrium that appears to characterize many channel systems. Another aspect of the unity exhibited by stream systems is exemplified in the branching network of tributaries comprising what is called the drainage net. In 1945, Robert E. Horton showed that the size of a given stream is related to the number of streams of that size, their average length, and average slope. There is a very constant quantitative rela tionship between these factors which can best be demonstrated by some actual data. Figure 9 is a sketch to define stream order, a measure of stream size. Horton defined order in the following manner. The smallest unbranched tributary in the headwaters is, by convention, designated order 1 ; a stream which has only tributaries of order 1 size is called second order; a third-order stream is one in which all tributaries are of second order or smaller, etc. Figure 10 shows that there is a logarithmic relation between stream order and length of streams of a given order and be tween stream order and numbers of streams. After this logarithmic relation within the drainage network was pointed out by Horton, it has been tested by many workers and found applicable, essentially without exception, to drainage basins of all sizes, including the very smallest rills and large river basins. One of the basic problems in the study of rivers is the identification of a general law or principle which provides a rationale in physical terms for the different types of unity exhibited by river channels and the networks which they comprise.

There is first an organization of the various parts. All river systems appear to have basically the same type of organization, differ as they may in detail. The river system is dynamic in that it has portions that move and can cause events and create changes. We often Fig. 9.

Thus one tends to speak about the river as if it had a will of its own. It is interesting, then, from the philosophic standpoint, to consider some of the aspects of these dynamic characteristics that have been used to</page><page sequence="21">RIVERS 531 express portions or the totality of the actions of the system which appear to have definite tendencies toward a direction of development, or ten dencies which tend to maintain the average conditions observed. One way in which this has been approached has been a description of the river system as having developmental stages through time. This was one of the basic concepts introduced by William Morris Davis, who described the geographical cycle as consisting of three principal stages comparable to the stages in the life of man. The stage of youth was EXPLANATION Average values, Arroyo Caliente Arroyo de los Frijoles Arroyo de las Trampas to Rio Santa Fe Rio Santa Fe, Rio Galisteo, and Ca?ada Ancha (del oriente) 56789 10 11 123 456789 10 11 STREAM ORDER Fig. 10.

The stage of maturity was described as a stage of equilibrium in which the work to be done in erosion was balanced against the capacity of the river system for doing this work. Broad valleys bordered by rounded hills characterized the stage of maturity. In the stage of old age, the river was pictured as flowing over a nearly flat plain or peneplain, and</page><page sequence="22">532 AMERICAN SCIENTIST during this relatively long period in the cycle the river was considered to be unable to do large amounts of work in erosion as a result of rela tively low relief and flat gradients. Similarly, at any one point in time the headwaters of a river system could be in the stage of youth, the central portion in the stage of maturity, and the downstream portion in the stage of old age. This characterization of a river system was extremely useful for teaching purposes, but from a quantitative standpoint many aspects are difficult to particularize. There followed, then, more detailed consideration of the concept of equilibrium, or grade, which Davis had thought of as characteristic of the stage of maturity. A graded stream was described by J. Hoover Mackin as one "in which, over a period of years, slope is delicately adjusted to provide, with available discharge and with prevailing channel characteristics, just the velocity required for the transportation of the load supplied from the drainage basin. The graded stream is a system in equilibrium; its diagnostic characteristic is that any change in any of the controlling factors will cause a displacement of the equilibrium in a direction that will tend to absorb the effect of the change (1948, p. 471)." Wolman extended this concept and pointed out that the concept of grade had two aspects, involving adjustability and stability. In one respect, the quasi-equilibrium of a graded stream is, as Mackin pointed out, characterized primarily by its ability to adjust to changes in external conditions. Wolman believed that a concept of quasi-equilibrium may be characterized by the stability of the system, but that adjustability perhaps was no less important a criterion. Another aspect which, under certain circumstances, had been used to describe the underlying tendency for a river toward a quasi-equilibrium condition was what might be called the principle of least work. There are certain characteristics, particularly hydraulic ones, which point to the tendency for minimization of work in a system. Recently, Langbein and I considered the various factors governing the direction of river work and reasoned as follows. Inspecting the physical principles which recur most often in analyses of different aspects of river morphology, the basic equations which are most prominent are the equation of conservation and the equation of continuity. These laws are so obviously general that they characterize each element or reach in any fluvial system. They must also characterize each unit of any path and at each instant in time. However necessary these equations might be, they are insufficient to explain the paths of particles moving in the river systems, or the relation between one part of the path to another. Therefore, they can alone tell us nothing about the surface form of the landscape, nor can they treat completely the progressive development or change of form with time. There must, therefore, be some other law of equal generality which</page><page sequence="23">RIVERS 533 would deal with energy distributions and their relation to changes of land forms in space and time. We proposed that implications of the second law of thermodynamics satisfy these requirements. The development of landscape involves not only the total available energy but also its distribution. The latter may be described by the concept of entropy, adapting that term from the comparable concept in thermodynamics. The essential idea is that the entropy of the system is a function of the distribution or availability of energy within the sys tem and not a function of the total energy within it. Thus, entropy has come to concern order and disorder, an aspect of the conception which has been utilized in physical chemistry and information theory. The degree of order or disorder in a system may be described in terms of the probability or improbability of any observed state. An increase in entropy is, then, a measure of the decrease in avail ability of the energy in the sense that a certain amount of energy is no longer available for conversion to mechanical work. The distribution of energy may be stated in terms of the probability of the given distribution occurring relative to alternative distributions possible. The statistical conception of entropy is that aspect which appears to have application to geomorphic systems. The distribution of energy in a geomorphic system is one way of expressing the relative elevation of particles of water and of sediment which gradually will, in the process of landscape evolution, move downhill toward base level. The longitudinal profile of the river, for example, is a statement of the spatial distribution of stream-bed materials with regard to their elevation and, thus, with regard to their potential energy. In thermodynamics, heat energy is referred to absolute temperature as a base. The absolute temperature defines an absolute limit or base datum, the situation in which molecular motion becomes zero. It is, then, the base level, or the datum, against which the energy content of a thermal system can be measured. Systems in geomorphology also have a base datum with regard to the distribution of energy. This base datum is the datum of elevation, in most cases represented by mean sea level. But the classical treatment of entropy in thermodynamics deals with closed systems in which entropy continuously increases to a maximum stationary level at equilibrium. In closed systems there is no loss or addition of energy. Geomorphic processes operate, on the other hand, in open systems in which energy is being added in some places while in other places energy is being degraded to heat and is thus lost insofar as further me chanical work is concerned. A river system, then, we consider to be an example of an open system, defining the system as the water and the debris in the river channel. As the water flows down the channel it gives up potential energy which is converted first to kinetic energy of the</page><page sequence="24">534 AMERICAN SCIENTIST flowing water and which in the process of flow is dissipated into heat along the channel margins. Precipitation brings increments of energy into the system because water enters at various elevations and thus with various amounts of potential energy. Heat is lost by convection, conduc tion, or radiation, yet the channel may be considered in dynamic equilibrium. The steady state possible in open systems differs from the steady state of static equilibrium of closed systems. We equate, therefore, the term steady state with dynamic equilibrium in geomorphology as defined early in the century by Gilbert and, more recently, by Hack. In an open system in dynamic equilibrium the rate of increase of entropy in the system is zero. The continuity of entropy then takes the form that the rate of outflow of entropy equals the rate of internal generation of entropy. In a river system in equilibrium, the rate of outflow of entropy is the rate of dissipation of energy as heat. This is equated to the rate of generation of entropy represented by the energy gradient toward base level. The stationary state of an open system is characterized by the conditions in which the rate of production of entropy per unit volume of flow is a minimum compatible with the conditions imposed on the system. Hence a stable system corresponds to one of least work, a con ception we were able to demonstrate in mathematical terms for certain conceptual models. The argument was developed that, with respect to the longitudinal profile of the river, the probability of the particular combination of values of energy in various unit distances along the course of the open system of the river could be described as proportional to the negative exponential of its ratio to the total energy of all possible states. This led to the conclusion that the most probable sequence of energy losses in successive units of river lengths corresponds to a uniform increase in entropy in each unit length along the river system. When this specifica tion is fulfilled without constraint on river length the longitudinal profile of the river tends to become exponential in form, a result in agreement with many actual river profiles. In the development of this probabilistic argument, random-walk models were constructed to demonstrate several aspects of the river system. Longitudinal profiles comparable to those of rivers may be constructed by random walks. As one example, beginning at an arbitrary point on cartesian graph paper, the walk moves from the initial point in unit steps to the right with various probabilities of a downward move ment simultaneously. Such random walks may be constructed from a series of random numbers or with special packs of cards, and the results from such mechanical construction of random walks were compared with a larger number of random walks developed on a digital computer. An example is shown in Figure 11. In this model an initial point was</page><page sequence="25">RIVERS 535 set at an elevation of 5 units above the base level. In successive moves, the walk proceeds to the right one unit at a time. There are 6 levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The deck of cards used to draw the random numbers was so arranged that the probability of a downward step during a unit step to the right was H/6. Thus the probability of a downward step decreases with elevation. On Figure 11 two sample random walks are shown marked by crosses and circles respectively. The average vertical position at any abscissa value was determined by averaging values for a large number of in dividual walks, and the average values define the profile drawn in a heavy line. This average profile is exponential in form, a general form exhibited by many natural stream profiles. Certain characteristics of drainage networks were also exemplified by random walks in various types of models. Figure 12 shows a random 0 5 10 15 20 DISTANCE, X Fig. 11. Sample random walks used in the generation of an average longitudinal profile of a river. walk drainage network. The random-walk models developed relation ships between average stream lengths and stream order very similar to those presented in Figure 10. In summary, it was shown by mathematical models, and checked by construction of average position of random walks under specified condi tions, that the most probable river profiles approached a condition in which the downstream rate of production of entropy per unit mass is constant. Other demonstrations of the applicability of the entropy concept to geomorphic features were also developed. It tentatively appears that the second law of thermodynamics pro</page><page sequence="26">530 AMERICAN SCIENTIST vides a general rationale for some aspects of landscape evolution and for certain important landscape forms. The probabilistic aspect of entropy gives a general reason for the variation among many examples of any given landscape feature?a variability, however, which does not obscure a unity among the many slightly different examples. by random choice Fig. 12. Development of a random-walk drainage basin network. In this brief r?sum? some of the relatively recent developments in thinking about rivers and river morphology have been mentioned. The contributions in the past decade have been centered around the math ematical analysis of river processes and of channel and drainage net characteristics. This work, contributed by a variety of scientists in different disciplines, has resulted in a quantitative description of many</page><page sequence="27">RIVERS 537 of the physical characteristics of rivers and, at least to some extent, a description of some processes in basic physical terms. The most immediate general problems still facing the geomorphologist are centered around three types of questions. The first concerns the mechanics of sediment transportation, particularly related to the move ment of bedload, which at present still can not be measured satisfactorily in real rivers under field conditions. The second general area seems to center in the question of the location and mode of energy dissipation in rivers and the effect of the energy utilization on erosion and deposition. This particular area, therefore, involves the relation of hydraulic factors to soil or lithologie factors. Among the latter is the erodibility of different types of materials particularly in relation to their stratigraphy and sedimentational characteristics. The third general area concerns the mode of transport of materials from slopes into the river channel. To a great extent, recent work in river morphology has been more concerned with river channels than with the hillslopes shedding debris toward the channels. Thus slope development, slope processes, and the relationship of slopes to the channels to which they are tributary remain an integral part of the study of rivers. These subjects encompass an area of nearly unlimited scope for research by engineers, geologists, soil scientists, botanists, physical chemists, and those possessing a variety of other skills.
