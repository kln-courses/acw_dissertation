Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1998. xiii, 449 pp. Notes. Index. $75.00, cloth. $24.95, paper. The purpose of this collection is "to reexamine Russia's Golden Age through the lenses of empire and nation" (p. 1). To the compilers, the "Golden Age" encompasses roughly a century of Russian history, starting from the age of Catherine the Great (1762) and ending with the death of Nicholas I (1855). The focus is on how Russia's poets, playwrights, historians and men of letters who lived and wrote during this period viewed their place in a society based on autocratic rule and on what they thought about their homeland as a nation and an evolving imperial power. In short, the work addresses interrelated questions of personal and national identity. The collection's fifteen articles are divided into four sections. The first, "Translatio Poetae: Poetics of Empire," is the largest. Harsha Ram's essay on "Russian Poetry and the Imperial Sublime" examines how the meaning of the sublime was affected by Russia's expansion eastwards and into the Caucasus during the reigns of Catherine the Great and her heirs. Seen through the poetry of the leading exponent of the "imperial sublime," G.R. Derzhavin, the objective, intellectual sublime of Lomonosov's era has become sensuous, subjective and oriental in quality. K. Hokanson's study, "Pushkin's Captive Crimea: Imperialism in the The Fountain of Bakhchisarai, " shows a similar oriental influence. In his view, Pushkin, through his traveler-narrator, reflects on how the feminine, sexualized Orient has become subservient to masculine Russia. Russians are Europeans, "but have absorbed the strength and poetic prowess of the Orient" (p. 148). Russians, through conquest, have become the heirs of the Turks and the Tatars and their subject world. Between these articles on the literary impacts of Russian imperial expansion into the East are three essays on cultural inheritances and influence. Monika Greenleaf s "Found in Translation: The Subject of Batiushkov's Poetry," examines the classically-minded Batiushkov and his "attraction to an ahistorical epicurean world woven out of unchanging classical topoi" (p. 52). For Leslie O'Bell ("Krylov, La Fontaine, and Aesop"), Krylov is ultimately independent of his influences, which included both Aesop and La Fontaine, and the creator of a truly Russian tradition of the fable where none had existed before. Gogol, too, was an innovator. In a thought provoking article, "A la recherche du genre perdu: Fielding, Gogol, and Bakhtin's Genre Memory," Ronald D. LeBlanc applies Bakhtin's "anthropomorphic notion of</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 485 'genre memory"' to hypothesize that Gogol could have used Fieldingesque features in his Dead Souls without ever having had direct access to Fielding's works. The second section, "Feminine Landscapes," is the smallest and consists of only two essays, although other contributions to the collection do reflect female interests. In "Beginning to be a Poet: Baratynsky and Pavlova," Stephanie Sandier and Judith Vowles explore the relationship between Evgenij Baratynsky (1800-1844) and Karolina Pavlova (1807-1893). Illuminating two lesser known poets of the nineteenth century, this essay points inwards into Russian society, where meaning is created among the gentry class through the medium of highly personalized verse letters, diaries, and albums, literary products remote from the entanglements of the Russian state. In "Cossacks and Women: Creation without Reproduction," Judith Kornblatt attempts to understand the Cossack myth, "a cultural construct in many ways more real than fact" (p. 174). The myth, Kornblatt argues, is used to "look inward to determine the Russian 'self,' and backward to remember, recover, and sometimes invent a unique national personality" (p. 176). The myth is almost wholly male, where reproduction occurs not through women but through "rebirth from the union of violent male Cossack and the fertile earth" (p. 1 89). In the third section, titled simply "Alternative Histories," we are presented with a miscellany of five essays. Jennifer Hixon's 'The Fall of Novgorod in Karamzin's Fiction and History" explores the conflicts between monarchical and republican principles. Hixon attempts to apply psychological reasoning to Karamzin's view of an essentially feminine Novgorod, as expressed in the literary tale "Marfa Posadnitsa," and a strongly masculine Moscow. In "Petr Andreevich Viazemsky: A Necessary Virtue," Sally Kux investigates Viazemsky's (1792-1878) use of anecdotes as a vehicle for historical exposition. Stephen Baehr's "Is Moscow Burning? Fire in Griboedev's Woe from Wit" considers the symbolism of fire in the language and context of Griboedev's seminal play. Irina Reyfman's "Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky: Bretteur and Apologist of the Duel" postulates the importance of the duel as "the Russian nobility's response to the failure of the Russian legal system to guarantee their individual rights" (p. 247). Finally, David Bethea's "Slavic Gift Giving: The Poet in History and Pushkin's The Captain's Daughter" examines the significance of gift giving. The fourth and final section of the collection, "Encroaching Modernity: The Public and the Subject," contains three articles. Melissa Frazier's well-written "Arabesques, Architecture and Printing," examines Gogol's thoughts on the impact of the printing press on literature. As Frazier points out, Gogol essentially supported the growing commercialization of literature, even though he was personally unable to live off his works. His support was also limited by his belief that the press could never replace architecture as a mode of expression for religious thought. Stephen Moeller-Sally's "0000: or, The Sign of the Subject in Gogol's Petersburg" attempts to "plumb the significance of the four round figures Gogol used to identify himself at the end of 1830" (p. 326). Discarding the traditional view, that the four O's are taken from Gogol's name, Moeller-Sally speculates that the strange non-de-plume is based on Gogol's reaction to the commercialism of St. Petersburg life. The name becomes, as it were, "Gogol's ironic self-presentation as a commercial subject, homo economicus" (p. 327). Between these two articles on Gogol is David Powelstock's "Living into Language: Mikhail Lermontov and the Manufacturing of Intimacy." This Canadian Slavonic Papers/Revue canadienne des slavistes Vol. XLI, Nos. 3-4, September-December 1999</page><page sequence="3">486 Book Reviews interesting article draws a contrast between the universal poetic identity of a writer such as Pushkin, who was content to submerge his poetic self into those of his predecessors and contemporaries, and the particularizing identity of Lermontov, who attempted to express his unique personality. Russian Subjects, as the editors claim (p. 17), provides the reader with an insight into "an energetic ferment in scholarship on Russia's Golden Age." Having said this, we must ask whether such an ambitious scope can be captured in a single collection of essays. Part of the problem is the expansive view of the "Golden Age," which, as interpreted in this work, is far from being a single historical, cultural or literary period. It would be difficult to argue that the world of Derzhavin has the same literary interests, problems or issues as those of Gogol, for example, or that Russia's sense of nationhood or identity remained unchanged. Most of the pieces fit into the collection's overall theme, although the connections to nation and empire are sometimes hard to discern. The difficulty in unifying the collection of articles is revealed in the long introductory essay, written by the editors, Monika Greenleaf and Stephen Moeller-Sally. While the introduction reviews each part of the collection and comments on each essay in turn, the reader is conscious that the work covers a variety of subjects from different parts of Russian literary history that do not blend together easily. It may have been better to limit the collection to a shorter time period, or concentrate on a smaller number of themes, e.g., poetry, historical writings, or novels. A second problem is the contributors' wide variety of interests. Some are broad in scope, while others focus on narrow, specialized topics. This is not to downplay the importance of individual pieces, but the overall impression is one of fragmentation and lack of balance. A quarter of the essays focus on Gogol, for example, while only two address Pushkin, a figure at the heart of the "Golden Age" as it is defined traditionally. Similarly, giants such as Karamzin and Lermontov attract only single articles. It is enlivening, however, to find articles on writers who are better known to literary specialists, such as Viazemsky, Bestuzhev-Marlinsky and Baratynsky. The variety of subject matter and scholarly approaches is matched by a variety of writing styles. Most pieces are elegantly written in well-articulated prose that is precise, to the point and easy to read. Less so are essays that reflect a post-modernist approach. This reviewer found some articles difficult, due to the annoying overuse of complex expressions (e.g., "a compensatory horizontal axis of extension," p. 31). Or, what is one to make of sentences such as: "poetry encounters history at the intersection of two axes, the point at which the terror of lyric afflatus is resolved in a compensatory and transformative identification with imperial power" (p. 31)? Equally irritating is the frequency in some essays of rarely used words (e.g., resituate, instantiate, afflatus, theorization, horizontality). The collection is accompanied by an index and copious notes, which are gathered together at the back of the work. A bibliography is wanting, but this is more than compensated for by extensive bibliographical references in the notes. The editors have done an excellent job in proofreading the text, which is, for the most part, free of typographical errors: rassukok, line 4.518 of Woe from Wit, should read rassudok on p. 235; contradictory (on the back cover).</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 487 Russian Subjects is a book ideal for browsing or for the reader who wants to delve into the complex issues of nationality and identity in Russian literature. It will probably be seen more as the first word on the subject, rather than the last, as the editors admit. It invites the reader to sample the wide range of avenues that are open to further research. Michael N. Aston, Edmonton</page></plain_text>
