<plain_text><page sequence="1">L. M. Leonov's Novel The Russian Forest By Victor Terra s University of Illinois Leonov's novel TheRussian Forest is a case in point of the in- compatibility of American and Soviet critical appraisal of literary art. In Russia, there has been a good deal of genuine controversy about every aspect of this work, but there is general agreement as to its having true stature. Several American and British scholars have dis- cussed it at length, and have found little to get excited about except, perhaps, Gracianskij, the fascinating villain of the novel. The con- sensus here seems to be that The Russian Forest is a rather ordin- ary product of socialist realism, not entirely devoid of craftsman- ship to be sure, yet inferior to such earlier works of Leonov as The Badgers and The Thief. 1 An analysis of the novel, accompanied by confrontation of existing American and Soviet opinions, should, therefore, be of interest for two reasons: to exemplify and bring into focus the difference in approach, and to produce a more objective appraisal of the novel itself. There is one thing which the extremely numerous Soviet critics of The Russian Forest have done at least as well as their Western colleagues: they have certainly given the text a close and sympa- thetic reading. 2 And, inasmuch as Leonov is, for all we know, a sincere communist and a Soviet patriot, certain aspects of the novel will be best appreciated by critics who are sympathetic to his be- liefs, who "speak his language." After all, the very generative idea of the novel stems from a personal preoccupation of Leonov the Soviet citizen, not Leonov the writer.3 On the other hand, a Western critic can discover some intriguing facets of the novel which the Soviet critic will be--or will pretend to be-blind to. In addition, we also want to evaluate the novel as we read it, i. e., without prior refrac- tion through the prism of a Soviet mind. This is, first of all, a novel about the beauty and beneficence of the Russian forest, and its plight at the hands of reckless (capitalist as well as communist) exploiters, 4 an eloquent anti-deforestation, pro-conservation pamphlet. To most Soviet readers-or, if not so, then certainly to most Soviet critics, and apparently to Leonov SEEJ, Vol. VIII, No. 2 (1964) 123</page><page sequence="2">124 Slavic and East European Journal himself-this is a most important aspect of the book. s Leonov had been waging a campaign to save the Russian forest even before he began to write this novel. In the controversy which developed around it, he once stated that he was certainly willing to listen to criticism, that he would, if necessary, make corrections in the text, but also, that he would not budge an inch from his position in re Russian forest. Norhas a single Soviet critic found fault with Leonov' s choice of so "technical" a topic for the novel which was to crown his life's work. If anything, some of them (notably those who disagree with Leonov in the conservation issue) have taken him to task for having over- lookedthe "production" angle of forestry, viz. the lumber industry!7 All Soviet critics think very highly of Vixrov's lecture in chap. vii. To them, it is one of the greatest assets of the novel, certainly one of its highlights." Now, to the taste of most Western readers, those fifty-odd pages filled with scientific, technical, historical, and lit- erary information are boring if read out of context, and an outright monstrosity if seen as an integral part of the novel. 9 The reason for such disagreement is obvious. Socialist realist fiction, didactic by definition, plays a much greater role as a medium of political and socio-economic discussion than does fiction in the West where the promotion of "crusades," exposure of public ills, and the like, have been largely relegated to non-fiction.io It is unlikely that the charges levelled against the American meat packing industry in Upton Sinclair's Jungle would have taken the form of a novel in the 1950's, or if so, that these charges would have produced the massive response which The Jungle had in 1906, or The Russian Forest in 1954. But even without the prop of publicistic actuality, the figure of the Soviet technician or engineer is imbued with as much glamor as that of the explorer, physician, or scientist-who are favorites both in Russia andtheWest.11 The professional problems, conflicts, and achieve- ments of the technician have, to the Soviet reader, an emotional quality which they seem to lack in the West. As the Soviet critic Sdeglov has pointed out, Leonov has let a "second," a symbolic forestgrow out of the "real" Russian forest. 12 All Soviet critics have, to a certain extent, acknowledged the pres- ence of some such symbolism in the novel. However, Sieglov's sweeping interpretation to the effect that Leonov's forest is not only a symbol of eternally pulsating life, and therefore of everything that is good and life-affirming, and so of the Russian narod, but that it is also the structural image of the novel itself, 14 has been almost unanimously rejected.15 I feel that, in their heroic efforts to purge Leonov of the charge of excessive symbolism, Sieglov's opponents, while doing a service to Leonov (which must have been their inten- tion), have done a disservice to the novel. Besides, they really do not have much of a case, for Leonov has obviously exceeded the mea- sure of symbolism alloted to any novel by the canon of socialist realism, to wit that its characters and images "be symbolic, in that due to their</page><page sequence="3">L. M. Leonov's Novel The Russian Forest 125 accuracy, profundity and vigor, they express the truth of history. " 16 Clearly, the symbolism is not limited to the very liberal use of such anthropomorphic, animistic, and outright mystic sylvan imagery as would, with some " stretching, " fall under the category of " fig- urative speech. " 17 The ideological structure of the novel (which, naturally, exceeds by far the confines of the conservation issue) is based upon the Russian forest: it is not by accident that the forces of evil are inimical, the positive characters friendly to the forest. The evil forces stand for the past, for destruction, and for death. Their unholy union is, to some extent, a mystical one. Gracianskij, the principalvillain, hates the forest because it is a symbol of life, and it is in a fit of mystic obsession that he thrusts his pointed walk- ing cane through the "heart" of the forest springlet which Vixrov, the positive hero, holds sacred. 18 The mystical traits in the phil- osophy of the good, the life-affirming, forces are even more explicit. Kalina, the old man of the forest, is an almost mythical being of superhuman wisdom and insight. 19 The philosophy of this simple peasant becomes Vixrov's and remains unchanged even when the naive farmboy has become a world renowned scientist. It is appar- ently also Leonov's personal philosophy. 20 Seglov, very shrewdly, has recognized the presence as well as the essentially religious na- ture of this philosophy. He describes it as a "passionate affirma- tion of life, " an intense awareness of the " interdependence of all living things in nature, of the community, responsibility and immor- tality of the cause of life. " 2 Needless to say, this philosophy is very close to Albert Schweitzer's reverentia vitae. 22 It is neces - sary to say that, while there is nothing exciting about a "passionate affirmation of life" (this being one of the more hackneyed clich5s of "official" Soviet philosophy), the idea of a universal biocoenosis, where man is a partner and not a master, is an intriguing one-cer- tainly, if putvis-h-vis the official party doctrine of the day. I think that Sieglov has, by and large, proved his charge of religiosity (xramovnidestvo) against Leonov. The fact that Leonov has also produced some eminently sound economic reasons why one should be kind to the Russian forest is merely an " extenuating circumstance. " No Soviet critic, not even S6eglov, has cared to point out that there appears still another kind of "religiosity" in the novel: Polja's attitude toward Moscow, Red Square, and the Lenin Mausoleum is an exact replica of, say, a devout Catholic girl's attitude toward the Church and its symbols. The role of the forest in the architectonic of the novel is a mani- fold one, even if one rejects as too fanciful Sdeglov's suggestion that the very structure of the novel is patterned after a forest. Another thesis of Sieglov's, to the effect that the forest is a symbol of the "eternal vortex of life, "23 also angrily attacked by his opponents, looks sound: the positive hero comes from the forest, and returns to the forest. He is sent on his way by Kalina, the old man of the</page><page sequence="4">126 Slavic and East European Journal forest, and in the end he returns to meet a reincarnation of that same Kalina. His life begins and ends at the sacred forest spring.24 96eglov suggests a two-dimensional polarity in the ideological structure of the novel: the conflict between two generations, and the conflict between good and evil (the latter between members of the old generation only). 25 The first of these conflicts is resolved when the young find that they have been in conflict only with what was "bad" about the old, realize the continuity of life and, joyously, "take over. " A good part of the plot deals with Polja's search for the truth about her father. The truth is that Vixrov has been "good" all along, and misunderstood by his daughter. Is this symbolic ? The other conflict is between the forest, the people (narod), and life, on one side, and the enemies of the forest, of the people, and of life, on the other. The young-discounting certain nondescript young men wearing patent leather jackets and moustaches-are all good. The Nazi invaders, and the capitalist West in general, are on the side of evil. The good, of course, wins in the end. Leonov's treatment of the younger generation has met with praise as well as criticism. Most Soviet critics see in Polja, Varja, Sere~a, and Rodion, but another version of the long established "positive hero" andheartily approve of them-perhaps with some reservations about their diction, which they find to be excessively "intellectual, " even "affected." 6 Some Soviet critics, among whom we find again Sceglov, go even further, claiming in effect that these positive he- roes of Leonov's are simply unreal, fabricated! The real positive young Russian, says 96eglov, is like the simple, softspoken SapoZ- kov, while the brilliant, rhetorizing Rodion, and the "firewhirl- heights" (ognevetrovys') in whichhe and Polja dwell, are a product of Leonov's imagination. 27 This is, of course, how the Western reader sees it.8 However, the matter is complicated by the fact that, along with their ascetic purity, high idealism, and extra- ordinary courage, our young heroes have also received from their creator some carefully "individualized" traits, expressed in psycho- logical observations which are, I think, generally sound, often in- genious, and sometimes strikingly penetrating. In fact, the charge of dostoevJjina (a Western reader is inclined to say Freudianism!), raised by every Soviet critic," 9 refers precisely to Polja's and Sere`a's excessive guilt complexes, self-laceration, and overcompensation- which traits are (from both a Freudian, and Dostoevskian viewpoint) well suited to motivate the extraordinary virtues of these young com- munists. Thus, the younger generation in The Russian Forest is another illustration of the irresoluble conflict between the "realist" and the "socialist" component of socialist realism. Polja has been properly chosen as an example of this conflict by the author of the article "On Socialist Realism. " 3o The conflict of good and evil is concentrated in and symbolized by the professional feud betweenVixrov, the friend, and Gracianskij,</page><page sequence="5">L. M. Leonov's Novel The Russian Forest 127 the enemy of the Russian forest. Naturally, Vixrov belongs to "the people" by descent and loyalty, while Gracianskij is the son of a well-to-do professor of canonic law. Vixrov is a type already familiar from Leonov's earlier novels: a "real" scientist (as against the "pseudo-scientist" Gracianskij), absorbed by his work, indifferent to personal gain or even prestige, good-natured to the point of being naive, also pure and generous. Soviet critics, following the exam- ple ofVixrov's student Os'minov in the novel, have accused Leonov of having made his positive hero too weak, too passive, and have found fault with his not letting Vixrov put up more of a fight either against the evil Gracianskij, or for the affection of his estranged wife, Leno'ka.31 They have altogether refused to recognize t he reason for Vixrov's helplessness which, to the Western reader, seems fairly obvious: Gracianskij happens to represent the view- point of the Soviet government, at least during the period in question. Nor has any Soviet critic ventured to discuss the question why Leonov decided not to grant either Vixrov or his wife (who is, like him, a highly positive, almost heroic, figure!) any of the personal happi- ness which he has in store for the younger generation. Is this sym- bolic of the generation whose happiness was lost between too many five-year plans? Or does Leonov's psychological image of the Soviet "builder of socialism" anticipate Haimson's intriguing insights?32 It is remarkable that Soviet and Western critics agree in finding Gracianskij a fascinating character. As Gibian has pointed out, he is, in his main traits, the typical Stalinist villain.33 On the other hand, Soviet critics have recognized that Gracianskij is not really a realistic character, but rather a grotesque. 4 Even if one concedes that Gracianskij is virtually persecuted by the narrator, who never tires of heaping sarcastic remarks, embarrassing details, and out- right abuse, upon his villain ( some Soviet critics feel obliged to contribute to this persecution of the defenseless Gracianskij, adding insults of their own), 35 he still remains repulsive and, what is worse, repulsive in a sordid, petty way, in spite of his elegant, Mephisto- philean appearance. How,then, can one account for the fascination ? I think that the key to this question is given in the words of the woman who has loved Gracianrskij all her life: "Everything depends on [...] whether you view the biography of a person from its beginning, or from its end. "36 The point is that we become acquainted with Gracianskij's biography only after we have already met the man and come to dislike him. We learn about the really crucial phase of his life only a few pages before we hear about his suicide. Gracianskij (as we meet him in the sixteenth, i. e., next to the last chapter of the novel) is a talented, but immature and vain young man, a romantic and a dreamer. A "revolutionary, " he is the leader of a small group of would-be terrorists. The whole thing is rather ridiculous and, anyway, the police have it well under control. Gra- cianskij's revolutionary activities end in shameful failure. First,</page><page sequence="6">128 Slavic and East European Journal a small-time agent of the secret police, whom he thought he had exposed and put to shame, easily turns the tables on him. An ex- tremely embarrassing scene ensues at the office of Colonel Cand- veckij of the secret police, strongly reminiscent, by the way, of Raskolnikov's interviews with Porfirij Petrovid.3 There seems to be a chance to "get even" with the Colonel when Gracianskij meets the former's wife and develops an affair with her. The "wife, " however, is not really the wife, but merely another agent of Cand- veckij's, and a prostitute to boot. In his eagerness to please his mistress, Gracianskij inadvertently betrays his friends Vixrov and Krajnov, who are arrested and exiled. There is another, even more embarrassing scene at the police office. Candveckij never disap- pears from Gracianskij's life. First, his betrayal-involuntary, to be sure, but still a betrayal-is on record in the files of the secret police. Shortly after the revolution, Gracianskij succeeds in des- troying some of the more incriminating evidence, but is never sure that there isn't more somewhere. Besides, Candveckij is alive and well (abroad, of course) and, on one occasion, sends his regards- through, of all people, Krajnov, now a Soviet diplomat. Gracianskij lives in constant fear that ~andveckij may try to blackmail his former "client," who has now become a prominent personage in the Soviet Union. And, toward the end, mysterious foreigners begin to visit Gracianskij. Their password is "Candveckij." Meanwhile, a casual visit by a young man who is writing a dissertation on the kind of "revolutionary" activity Gracianskij had been engaged in comes as a terrible jolt. And when Polja, who has finally seen through the sinister role Gracianskij has played in her father's life, throws not only the truth but also an inkwell in his face, the eloquent Aleksandr Jakovlevid ejaculates a feeble "my God!" and is, thereafter, aman half dead. His suicide follows a few weeks later. Gracianskij, an artist at heart, had chosen the career of a forest engineer " for health reasons. " Since he has no liking for the out- doors, or for systematic research work, the "economics of forest exploitation" inevitably becomes his specialty. Obviously, since his position is incomparably more vulnerable than Vixrov's, due to his social background, he has no choice but faithfully adhere to the party line of the moment. If the policies of the party happen to be destructive ones, it is not his fault. The point is that Gracianskij carries out these destructive policies con amore: because of his obsession with destruction and death, because of his hatred of the Soviet system (which he knows he is undermining by pushing Russia's deforestation), and because of his personal hatred for Vixrov, whom he seeks to destroy as he had earlier destroyed his predecessor, Tuljakov. Gracianskij's nihilism is of the aggressive variety; it is charged with emotion, much as that of the "underground man" in Dostoevskij's work. 38 He "lives" his negativism to such anextent that he is compelled to proselytize it (a risky business! ). His death</page><page sequence="7">L. M. Leonov's Novel The Russian Forest 129 wish finds artistic expression in a private treatise "On Suicide, " and ultimate fulfillment in his own suicide. An important point, which Soviet critics have completely ignored, is that Gracianskij, contemptible character that he is, has some things to saywhich even the Soviet reader cannot possibly help tak- ing seriously.39 Leonov lets the devil's advocate play his part well-so well, in fact, that at least in the case of literature, one may be inclined to suspect the author himself of gracianscina. 40 It probably is no accident that Vixrov, the positive hero, is in matters of art a philistine. 41 Gracianskij stands not only for the decay, the corruption, and the certain death of the "old world, " 4 but also for its sophistication, its splendor, and its sinful appeal.43 A strik- ingly handsome man, he lives in luxury (by Soviet standards), has an excellent record collection, is widely read, and is a brilliant conversationalist. Surely it is not an accident that his antagonist is a plain looking man of simple tastes and pleasures. And perhaps it is not an accident either that, in spite of everything he has done to her, Gracianskij is loved to the end by Natalija Sergeevna, a re- markable woman and a beauty, while Vixrov is unable to win the love of the plain girl whose benefactor he is. SCeglov and other critics of the Thaw have, I think, misunder- stood Gracianskij, when they say that he should have been presented entirely as a product of Soviet society, a careerist and an opportun- ist, motivated by nothing but personal gain, rather than as what he is in Leonov's novel.44 Gracianskij's Vorgeschichte, naturally, would not fit into this scheme, nor would the symbolic scene at the forest spring, and Sceglov, quite consistently with his ideas, dis- approves of both. Leonov himself seems to have wavered between a psychological (almost metaphysical) and a social (more positiv- istic) orientation, as is suggested by the presence of three different versions of Gracianskij's suicide. In the original version (Znamja, No. 12 [December 1953], p. 155) Gracianskij's suicide is briefly mentioned, but no details given. In the edition of 1954 (Moskva: Molodaja gvardija, 1954, p. 651), we are told that he drowned him- self in an ice hole, on which detail the narrator makes some cruelly ironic comments. Finally, in post-Thaw editions, the ironic com- ments are put into Vixrov's mouth: "Altogether, Valerij and I doubt that he didn't merely leave his hat and cane at the ice hole, to fool us once again, just to play another trick on our simpletons" (II, 468). I do not think that Vixrov's remark is to be taken literally. It can, however, be interpreted as an attack on "Gracianskijs" in general, which is how Soviet critics have understood it.45 Ironically, the pre-Thaw version is the more profound: the penetrating psycho- logical and ideological analysis of the villain would be wasted on a Drozdov. It is, however, not for this reason that most Soviet critics disagree with reglov, but because, in their opinion, so thoroughly evil a person as Gracianskij could not possibly be the</page><page sequence="8">130 Slavic and East European Journal product of Soviet society.46 Yet, these critics would not like to see him changed, or his role in the novel curtailed, ostensibly because the evil which he stands for is still alive in the so-called "vestiges of capitalism. "47 I suspect that this is a rationalization, and that the real reason is that the novel owes so much of its interest and fascination to its villain. 48 Western critics, so far as I can see, have really said no more than that Gracianskij is indeed a fascinat- ing character. Gibian very thoughtfully observes that it is hard to say why. 49 I think the reason may be, from a Western viewpoint, something like the following: Intentionally, or by an intuitive stroke of genius, Leonov has performed here a typically Dostoevskian psychological experiment, i. e., he has taken a very real character and placed him into an "experimental setup" so designed as to put his psyche under great and ever increasing strain. The purpose of the experiment is to de- termine if the subject can stand the strain and continue to exist as a human being, or if not, where the "breaking point" is. I believe that the figure of young Gracianskij is a true and profound psycho- logical study of an adolescent intellectual, who is morally neither good nor bad, but if anything, the former-by Western standards, that is. 50 He is vain, somewhat arrogant, rather selfish; but he is capable of genuine love, has great intellectual curiosity, is artis- tically inclined; nor does he lack idealism or a sense of honor-as far as this is possible for a man who is not naturally strong and bold. The "experimental setup" is life under the Soviet system, 51 which puts a terrible strain on a person used to intellectual freedom, ma- terial independence, plenty of leisure, and a congenial social at- mosphere. The result of the experiment: the subject cannot exist (at least not like a human being) under these conditions. He de- teriorates morally, gradually sheds all positive human qualities, develops a strong death wish, and eventually commits suicide. While Leonov certainly does not sympathize with Gracianskij (un- less the narrator's cruel sarcasm is transmuted into the pathos of compassion by a "negation of the negative"), the Western reader will probably identify himself with this character more likely than with anyone else in the novel. It is in this sense that, I think, Gracianskij, the Soviet "underground man, " is a truly tragic, a symbolic, and perhaps a great creation of Leonov's. The formal aspect of The Russian Forest has been treated in considerable detail by a number of Soviet critics, while their West- ern colleagues have limited themselves to general observations. What I should like to add to these comments is, for the most part, connected with the dostoevjiina in Leonov's novel, a trait which Soviet critics have either underplayed (often in an apologetic man- ner), or ignored. Contrary to the opinion of most Western critics " (Hingley being a notable exception), I feel that, in The Russian Forest, Leonov has come closer to writing a truly Dostoevskian novel than ever before in his career.</page><page sequence="9">L. M. Leonov's Novel The Russian Forest 131 In one of his more recent articles, L. P. Grossman lists a number of structuraltraits which he believes are characteristic of Dostoev- skij's novels. s3 Aconfrontation of The Russian Forest with Gross- man's catalogue of traits reveals that of the eighteen listed, fourteen are definitely present in Leonov's novel. They are: the structural principle of "the other story" (there are actually three different cy- cles in The Russian Forest); 54 the technique of "musical counter- point" (characters and themes are almost invariably developed contrapuntally, i. e., introduced casually at first, then more promi- nantly but still off-stage, untilthey are finally brought out fully, to stay in the foreground as another theme or character begins to rise in the background); the "conclave" ( e. g., the faculty meeting at the Forest Institute, or the scene between Vixrov, Gracianskij, Taiska, Sergej, and Kolja, which solves the conflict of Sergej's social ori- gin); the "cornucopia of mishaps" (for a while blows are raining hard and fast on Vixrov; in the end it is Gracianskij who is getting one jolt after the other); the "martyrologium of the hero" (Vixrov and Lenocka); the "banal anecdote" which grows into high tragedy (Gracianskij's affair with Emma is a perfect example); the "con- fession" (Ceredilov's confession to Vixrov, Polja's confession to Strunnikov); "inner dialogue" (amply represented, mainly with Polja); "bibliographical keys" (Candveckij is nicknamed "Herman" because of an "unpleasant gambling incident"; Gracianskij is iron- ically likened toSt. Augustine, and to the vulture of Prometheus; he is also declared to be a " spiritual scion of Zarathustra," and char- acterized by his erudition in philosophical and belletristic treatments of suicide, just as Vixrov is characterized by his amazing familiarity with a tremendous amount of literature on all aspects of forestry); "verbal tournaments" (of these there are many, e.g., Polja vs. Natalija Sergeevna, Grancianskij vs. Mor`dixin, Polja vs. Kittel); a "purloined manuscript" (Gracianskij's manuscript which Vixrov reads secretly); "author's commentary" ( extremely frequent) ; the "tragic intermezzo" (e. g., the story of Semenixa and her sons, the biogra- phy of Knysev and its tragic end) ; the "dream-novella" ( Polja's long, deeply symbolic dreams). The device called "d6nouement of The Inspector-General" by Grossman is not used, although some Soviet critics would have liked to see it applied to Gracianskij. 5s There are no explicit "literary parallels," but the ghost of Dostoev- skij is not infrequently present. 56 It is a question whether or not Grossman's term disput-trilogija can be applied to The Russian Forest. And, there is no "final catastrophe, " except for Gracian- skij's suicide. And now, a few more general traits. Leonov has always admired Dostoevskij's "multidimensionality. "57 The Russian Forest is an amazingly "multidimensional" novel, its tensions developing along a variety of different vectors, such as "old-young, " " people- intellectuals, " "war-peace, " "man-woman, " "pro-forest-anti-</page><page sequence="10">132 Slavic and East European Journal forest,""science-pseudo-science," and so on. Nor is the move- ment of the novel a simple linear one. The fate of some characters (Vixrov, Polja) is viewed "from the beginning, " that of others (Gracianskij, Natalija Sergeevna) "from the end, " as the plot un- folds itself both forward and backward in time. Moreover, it re- sembles a curve rather than a straight line and, in the case of the older generation (Vixrov, Gracianskij), a spiral rather than a simple curve. The vortex of life58 takes Vixrov and Gracianskij alternately down to its depths and up to its heights. It makes at least half a dozen full turns before finally sucking Gracianskij into the cold water of the ice hole. Vixrov is nearly drowned more than once, before he is ultimately carried to safety. It is due to an unending chain of fateful coincidences that the vortex keeps churning. 59 And it is the presence of this veritable maze of coincidences that convinces one that The Russian Forest cannot be a realistic novel-unless it be in the Dostoevskian "higher sense." Only as part of the texture of a Dostoevskian " ideological mystery, " where the whole action has a symbolic connotation and the main characters stand for ideas, do they make sense. That such is in fact the proper interpretation of all these amazing coincidences is suggested by Leonov's own remarks in connection with the last and perhaps most amazing of them all. Back in his native forest after an absence of many years, Vixrov meets a little boy at the sacred spring of his youth. He asks the boy what his name is, but knows the answer beforehand, and is not in the least surprised when he hears the name that to him is sacred: Kalina. And Leonov proceeds thus: "This was not a miracle, not even an amazing coincidence. It was the most ordinary continuation of life, as it occurs in nature. In spite of everything, it just could not come to an end, or disappear entirely, that stream of joyful, foaming, wise substance. And if old Kalina could, just as simply as that, appear in the form of a tree, or a fog, the autumn wind, or a dozing tomcat, how much easier would it be for him to become reincarnate in a poor peasant boy ?" 60 There is one rather important difference between the "mystery" of Leonov and those of Dostoevskij. Leonov, while he may have wished to make his "mystery" a polyphonic one, was restrained from developing the voices of evil as fully as the voices of good. While we can see the world as it appears to the narrator, to Polja, and to Vixrov, we must more or less "reconstruct" Gracianskij's or Kittel's private point of view. But on the other hand, we do see the main characters through the eyes of many different people. Gracian- skij, for instance, is "introduced" by Natalija Sergeevna; he then meets Polja and we see him through her eyes; next it is Taiska who speaks of him in her own way, and then a host of other people, as well as the narrator himself. In connection with the question of "polyphonism" in The Russian Forest, it is interesting to note that Leonov, like Dostoevskij, is being charged not only with " poor</page><page sequence="11">L. M. Leonov's Novel The Russian Forest 133 style, " but also with letting all of his characters speak the same language, viz. his own. 61 I believe that this impression is almost as much of an "optical illusion" here' as it is now understood to have been in the case of Dostoevskij's novels. True, there are some weakly developed characters (Morc'ixin, Os'minov),6 but the principal characters are carefully individualized. Like Dostoevskij, Leonov prefers to breathe life into his characters by occasionally bringing out some highly specific, deeply personal traits of their speech, orby making some striking observation on their mannerism, mimicry, or "intonation, " 63 rather than by scrupulously adhering to an individual pattern throughout. 64 Therefore, a philologically in- clined critic (but not the ordinary reader!) will easily detect "mis- takes" in the stylization of Leonov's dialogue. Moreover, Leonov uses the device which Lobanov calls nesobstvennoprjamaja reJ' (close to what the Germans call erlebte Rede), where the speech and the thoughts of.his heroes are refracted through the prism of the narrator's sentiment65 -again, a very Dostoevskian trait. The texture of The Russian Forest is overwhelmingly complex, burdened by a mass of heterogeneous detail66 -still another Dos- toevskian trait. 67 The question is whether Leonov has succeeded in integrating this huge body of detail into the basic structure of the novel. Everybody seems to agree that some of the philosophical discourses (I would single out those between Morg6ixin and Sereza) appear to be "foreign bodies" in the novel. But on the other hand, many of the verbal tournaments are not only interesting in themselves, but also well enough motivated, for instance the one between Mor- S"ixin and Gracianskij. Leonov's "author's commentary" contains many intriguing aphorisms and well formulated observations on life and people, which are enjoyable as such and, in addition, help to develop contact between reader and narrator. I have to disagree with Rosen and Sdeglov who, for different reasons, believe that the forest, as a symbol and as an image, has been overworked. I think that Rosen does not realize to what an extent this is a symbolic novel. Sdeglov does realize it, but he happens to like realistic (not symbolic) ideological novels. As to details of byt, as well as of the heroes' personal experience, a careful study of the novel makes one admire Leonov for the circum- spection and ingenuity expended in the process of working these into the texture of the novel. They create a foundation of "real life" plausibility for his "ideological mystery," and frequently establish themselves as "labels, " or even as symbols. There are dozens of threads which can be pursued through the whole novel, for instance: Lenocka's (and later, Polja's) cold hands-most significant in view of the circumstance that toward the end of the novel Lenocka no longer fears the cold; Gracianskij's blood count (gemoglobin), his constant mention of the eating-house on Karavannaja and, last but not least, Braga's Serenade;68 mysterious 25 ruble remittances received by</page><page sequence="12">134 Slavic and East European Journal Vixrov in his student days; Polja's torn shoes, which even have a "pet name" (or rather, two: ryliki and rvaniki); Lenocxka's picture on Vixrov's desk; the children playing karavaj in the yard of the tene- ment; Mord*ixin's watch. In other instances, an event which ap- peared to be of incidental nature acquires a psychological, or sym- bolic, meaning when we are reminded of it much later, for instance: Vixrov's study, as itexistedin Polja's imagination, becomes reality as Gracianskij's study; when Demid Zolotuxin, after almost twenty years of separation, comes to see Vixrov, he wryly recalls a child- hood experience of theirs (the theft of Mar'ja Elizarovna, the tame squirrel) as crucial in their relationship; Giganov, the police agent, says he will finish his own life "in an ice hole-"--in the end, Gra- cianskij, Giganov's tormentor, suffers precisely that fate. Leonov's language has drawn praise as well as criticism, both in Russia and in the West. 69 Nobody, as far as I can see, has attempted to ex- plain the connection, if any, between the ideological content, the structure, and the language of the novel. The similarity to Dostoev- skij's style (especially that of such early works as The Double and Gospodin Proxarcin, but also Notes from the Underground) is obvious. Like Dostoevskij, Leonov is a "poor stylist. " His is a heterogeneous language, lacking entirely in harmony, balance, "propriety": we meet pompous archaisms side-by-side with colloquial neologisms; scientific prose alternates with puns and slovecki, high pathos with light banter. The prevailing emotive traits are, first of all, irony-cruel, sarcastic, when Gracianskij, or some other villain, is the target; good-natured, but sometimes a little wry, when Vixrov, Polja, orSere'a are involved. Then, affectation-obvious rifts (both hyperbolic and litotetic)70 between statement and drama, or between statement and image, occur at every step. The mode of the narrative in general can be called outre. Atthe same time, there are passages of great poetic beauty, harmony, and dignity, for instance, some marvellous epic descriptions of the forest, as well as of Petersburg and Moscow. There is an inexhaustible supply of entertaining, in- triguing-and sometimes annoying-verbal detail, especially in the adjectives, and in the metaphors and similes. Like Dostoevskij, Leonovdearly loves original metaphoric expressions in his psycho- logical formulations. And he likes to reveal the psyche of an indi- vidual by recording, in minute detail, the movements of his body, the play of his features, and the tone of his voice. From a formalviewpoint, the entire arsenal of Dostoevskij's style is in evidence. The question is: has Leonov been able to integrate this great wealth of heterogeneous material? Does it all (the irony, the affectation, the outre' diction, etc.) "make sense" ? Or is this lush growth of verbal wealth an end in itself, as Rosen suggests, certainly very ingeniously, when he observes that, sometimes, it is the Russian language that is the real hero of the novel. 71 Baxtin has, I think, solved the problem for Dostoevskij, in whose diction</page><page sequence="13">L. M. Leonov's Novel The Russian Forest 135 the elements which I have just listed for Leonov have the function to create a highly personal, selfconscious style, a style which is the reflection of an incessant "inner dialogue, " with continuous sideglances at a hypothetic third person.7" A Dostoevskian narrator is constantly "talking to himself" and, since he is excited, nervous, and frustrated most of the time, his language tends to be outr", af- fected, and "off balance. " What appears to be a constant rift be- tween content and form is, if properly understood, really the emo- tional tension, the struggle between the two or more different voices of which the Dostoevskian "polyphonic" narrative is composed. Can Leonov claim the benefit of a similar interpretation? I think that to a certain extent he can. In the case of Gracianskij, the wordiness, affectation and excessive pointedness of his speech are a psychologically well-motivated expre ssion of nigh unbearable nerv- ous strain and constant fear. The man uses language as a shield (or as a smokescreen) . But his position, so he feels, is so inse- cure that he must make almost incessant reconnaissance thrusts, sorties, and raids into enemy territory, thus rendering himself even more vulnerable. Moreover, he is not only defending himself against the visible enemy of the moment, and against the invisible but omni- present Party, but is also engaged in an endless sciamachy against his own taedium vitae. His speech is always "barbed duologue, " to use Hingley's felicitous term.73 Can the same reasoning be applied to Leonov himself? How much of Gracianskij's "mimetism, " how much of Dostoevskian "barbed monologue 74 can we credit him with? I think it would take a de- tailed stylistic study to give an answer to this question (unless, of course, Leonov himself will supply us with a credible interpretation!). As conscious as Leonov is of Dostoevskij's craftsmanship,75 he must, of course, be aware of the organic interpretation given to it by Bax- tin. Therefore, it is a priori unlikely that Leonov would continue to expose himself to charges of dostoevs'ina, affectation, pompous- ness, obscurity, and involved syntax, without having weighty rea- sons for writing in this style. Without venturing to speculate any further, one can at least say that Leonov's "difficult" diction cer- tainly accomplishes one thing: it gives the narrative an inimitable personal touch.76 Notes 1. R. Hingley, "Leonid Leonov, " Soviet Survey, No. 25 (1958), p. 74, personally regards Russian Forest as Leonov's masterpiece, but states that he knows "qualified judges who look upon The Russian Forest as a relative- ly weak work. " Ernest J. Simmons, Russian Fiction and Soviet Ideology (Morningside Heights, New York: Columbia University Press, 1958), p. 158, says that " The Thief, written twenty-five years earlier, is in some respects a deeper, more emotionally disturbing, and certainly a more challenging novel. " Nathan Rosen, The Fiction of Leonid Leonov (Columbia Ph. D. Disserta- tion, 1961, Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, Inc. [1961]), p. 243, states that Russian Forest "lacks the vitality of even such an early work as The Thief. "</page><page sequence="14">136 Slavic and East European Journal Helen Muchnic, From Gorky to Pasternak (New York: Random House, 1961), pp. 295-303, holds an even lower opinion of Russian Forest than either Simmons or Rosen. 2.

As early as 1947, we see Leonov fighting the cause of the Russian forest. An article of his, "B 3aIlITy Iapyra,"&lt;&lt;H3BecTL14,&gt;&gt; 28 December 1947, contains most of the ideas voiced by Vixrov in Russian Forest. For a detailed account of Leonov's publicistic activities in behalf of conservation and afforestation, see B.A. KOBaJIeB, "1/3 TBopMecKoPI I4CTOpMM poMaHa &lt;&lt;PyccKC'4W Jec&gt;&gt; JIeoHMAa JIeoHoBa,"&lt;&lt;Bonpocai coBeTCKIO4 JIATepaTypbI,&gt;&gt; VI (1957), 328-376. 4. It is an intriguing question whether Leonov was actually crusading on his own, challenging the wisdom of the party, as Hingley assumes ( p. 70), or if he was merely filling another "social order." On the one hand, Valerij Krajnov who, in the novel, stands for the party (see, e. g., 3. KeApvHa, "B 3aMrATy HapoJnHOAN A3HM," &lt;&lt;COBeTCIa R xyJoxeCTBeHHaSI rpo3a&gt;[M.: COBeTIcKi4 rlncaTeJIB, 1955], 494), is not exactly on Vixrov's side in the conservation issue, and is to some extent guilty of gra- ciansWfina, as M. llerJIoB, "&lt;&lt;PyccKo4i iec&gt; JIeoH~na JieoHoBa," &lt;HOBBIPi MMp,&gt;1954, No. 5, p. 241, has correctly observed. On the other hand, a large scale afforestation program was being promoted by the Soviet government at about the time when Leonov was working on his novel ( see Avrahm Yarmolinsky, Literature under Communism [Indiana University Pub- lications: Russian and East European Series, Vol. xx, 1960], p. 52). 5. The book created a violent controversy in professional circles, and Leonov was delighted to participate in it ( see Kovalev, pp. 360-371, (M. JlodaHoB, &lt;&lt;PoMaH JI.JIeoHoBa "PycciMi4 VJec "&gt;&gt;M.: COBeTcIcIKii nIMcaTeJIae, 1958], cTp.118-125). 6. See Kovalev, p. 365, where an oral statement to this effect is quoted. See also JI.

Western critics, naturally, have an even better eye for such symbolism, and are not, like their Soviet colleagues, apologetic about it. See, e.g., Simmons, p. 157. 14. The idea is, however, a good one. The involved, baroque structure of the novel does resemble a forest; nor is Sdeglov's association of a work of literature with a "forest" without precedent: I am thinking of the Silvae of Statius and his baroque imitators. 15.

Some critics (e. g., Knipovid, p. 3) observe that Vixrov's helplessness casts a shadow on the positive forces of Soviet society in gen- eral. Must it really take a deus ex machina type appearance of the party to save the hero's job and reputation, asks H. Fed, "4liHet, obpa3b H ~oIH- ?JI4MIKTbI poMaHa JI.

Haimson, "The Solitary Hero and the Philistine: A note on the Heritage of the Stalin Era, " Daedalus, Summer 1960, pp. 544-545. Haimson's description of the lonely hero fits Vixrov well indeed. 33. Gibian, p. 114. 34. See, e.g., SSeglov, pp. 234-236; Vlasov, p. 195. H. 3JDiicepr, &lt;&lt;Boripocbl TeopiH caTMpbI&gt;&gt; (M.: COBeTcKHMI nrIcaTeaJ, 1957), CTp. 261-262, points out the mechanical, almost automatic way in which Gracian- skij goes through the motions of his role-typical of a satirical figure. Rosen, p. 228, shares this impression: "We see Gracianskij only from the outside, as a grotesque, or a face frozen into an expressionless mask. " 35. See, e.g., Tarasenkov, p. 394; Vlasov, p. 164. 36. "Bce 3aBIMCI4T OT Toro ,HoJTeHIKca,OTIKyaa paccMaTp1BaTb qeJIo- BeqecKyio dHorpacHIO, c Haqaria HM44 C KOHLa," says Natalija Ser- geevna (I, 22). 37. See Rosen, p. 220. Soviet critics rather tend to compare this scene with Klim Samgin's interrogation by Rotmistr Popov (M.

Gracianskij perfectly fits the description of the "underground man" given by Louis R. Jackson, Dostoevsky's Underground Man in Russian Lit- erature ('s-Gravenhage: Mouton and Co., 1958), p. 214 and passim. 39. The young Gracianskij's theory of immortality is not uninteresting, though not too original (I, 226) ; his philosophy of history, while cynical and, again, not very original, seems nearer to the facts than historical materialism (I, 148-151); his remarks about Soviet art and literature are devastating (II, 113-119). 40. Hingley, p. 73. 41. E.g., he spoils the Bach concert for his wife by his incessant "lec- turing. " The incident is a significant one in the story of this unhappy mar- riage (I, 487-490) . 42. The idea that "the non-Communist West is a world decaying morally and physically, tormented by fear and hate and in the grip of taedium vitae"</page><page sequence="17">L. M. Leonov's Novel The Russian Forest 139 is most commonly expressed in all Soviet postwar literature (Yarmolinsky, p. 97). 43. Here I am following Rosen, p. 228. 44. Sieglov, pp. 233-235. I. Orestov, in a letter to the editor of LG, 23 March 1954, entitled "HenocTaTKIH pKoro, 0oJITLmoro npoH3BeneHR4," expresses the same idea, 45. E.g., Boguslavskaja, pp. 341-342. Rosen, p. 208, takes it literally. 46. See, e.g., Lobanov, p. 41. 47. However, some Soviet critics would have preferred to see Gracianskij exposed (by the proper agencies), brought to trial, and punished (e. g., Kni- povi6, p. 3) . 48. I venture to say that some of the Soviet critics actually "give them- selves away" in this respect. Thus, Boguslavskaja, p. 336, exclaims: "Eti stranicy romana [about Gracianskij's past] 6itajutsja s zaxvatyvajui6im interesom. " 49. Gibian, p. 114. 50. Young Gracianskij reminds one of Sebastian Barnack of Aldous Huxley's novel Time Must Have a Stop who "betrays" Bruno Rontini to the fascist police under circumstances not dissimilar to those under which Gracianskij betrays his friends. 51. It is important to realize that it was not the revolution that brought out the evil in Gracianskij (on the contrary, he is said to have really "lived" during those "days of creation"-I, 371-372), but the disillusionment of the "building of socialism. " See Rosen, p. 225. 52. Of these, H. Muchnic's comments are by far the harshest, as she believes that "the literary echo is purely stylistic. In substance and feeling, nothing could be further from Dostoevsky" ( p. 297). 53. JI. II.

The description of phantastic, " spec- tral" St. Petersburg (I, 194), immediately brings to mind Dostoevskij's famous passages. The "breaking in half" of Gracianskij's soul after the inkwell throwing incident is very Dostoevskian, indeed. 57. Rosen, p. 251, quotes the evidence to this effect. 58. The term krugovorot, applied to Leonov's novel by Sceglov, reminds one of Grossman's vixr', applied to the structure of Dostoevskij's novels ( JIeoHKa FpoccMaH, &lt;&lt;TBopMecTBo aOCToeBCIoro&gt;&gt; [M.: CoBpeMeH H bIe npodJIeMbI, 1928], CTp.322, and passim. 59. Both Soviet and Western critics have found fault with this trait ( plus several instances of "convenient" eavesdropping). See, e.g., Simmons, p. 143; Sieglov, p. 225. 60. II, 454.

Noted even by Soviet critics, e. g., Lobanov, p. 97. 63. The amazing wealth of detail has been pointed out, and collected, by several Soviet critics, e. g., Vlasov, p. 201 (Gracianskij) ; Lobanov, pp. 19- 24(Vixrov), pp. 44-53 (Gracianskij), pp. 65-70 (the younger generation). 64. How true this is of Dostoevskij, M. M. JIanWmH,0&lt;&lt;3TeTHKca JLoc- ToeBcKIoro&gt;&gt;(Berlin: Obelisk, 1923), pp. 20-21, has demonstrated most convincingly. 65. Very well described by 96eglov, pp. 228-229. 66. Hingley, p. 70; Muchnic, p. 295. 67. Grossman (loc. cit., note 58) claims that Dostoevskij's craftsman- ship amounts primarily to an ability to integrate vast masses of seemingly heterogeneous material. 68. Surely symbolic! Gaetano Braga's "Serenade of the Angels" is a piece of "sweet, " sentimental music, but rather "cheap. " 69. Soviet critic s charge Leonov with being too "rhetorical" and involved; they donot mind his colloquialisms or his argotisms, but dislike his frequent use of archaisms. See, e.g., Tarasenkov, pp. 404-408; Lobanov, pp. 198- 201. 70. Lobanov, p. 173, seeks to justify Leonov's striking predilection for the diminutive. 71. Rosen, p. 241. 72M.M. .
