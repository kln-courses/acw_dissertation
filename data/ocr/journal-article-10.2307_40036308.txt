<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY ADEQUATE? In this paper I want to examine the question of empirical theism in terms of its philosophical and religious adequacy. A major criti- cism which has been directed at any kind of empirical theism comes from Charles Hartshorne.1 He maintains that any kind of strictly empirical theism would make God a contingent being, different in degree perhaps from other contingent beings, but not different in kind. Any purely contingent being, by its very nature would not be God and the worship of such a being would be idolatry. God, as an adequate object of worship and of philosophical investigation must be a necessary being rather than a contingent one. This is of course the heart of the ontological proof which Hartshorne supports in his reformulation of Anselm's argument. Furthermore it would seem to be the case that one cannot arrive at the existence of a necessary being by means of an argument with purely empirical premises alone. Thus, if Hartshorne is right one could never arrive at God from the premises of a strict empirical theism. Many would support the view that God can only be arrived at on the basis of specifically revealed premises or by means of a frankly apriori argu- ment which builds necessity into the very concept of God. One could point to Hume's famous Dialogues at this point as indi- cating just how far short of God you fall by trying to use empirical premises. This is seen in his famous criticism of the Design argument. Under this argument the most you could get would a be kind of divine architect of the universe, a committee of designers, a senile deity, or a deity learning how to create worlds. Hume's criticisms would seem to indicate clearly that to arrive at a doctrine of God, remotely approaching that of the Judeo-Christian tradition, one 1 For a major elucidation of Charles Hartshorne's views the following works are crucial.

Combine this with Hartshorne's contention that a contingent being could not be God, and one has a strong refutation of attempts to build an exclusively empirical doctrine of theism. It should be remembered that for Hartshorne God does have his contingent aspects, but he is not a purely contingent being - he has a primordial and a consequent nature - his necessary existence and his contingent attributes. From the perspective of this criticism let us examine empirical approaches trying to see first why they would have been developed and secondly trying to reevaluate their religious and philosophical adequacy. The attempt to develop an empirical philosophy of reli- gion should have even more appeal in our time than in times past. Revealed religion seems to increasing numbers of people, irrelevant, doctrinaire, and arbitrary. This of course does not prove that it is so, but it is a fact that the road of revelation seems an increasingly hard one for educated people to take. One difficulty here is what you do with conflicting revelations. As for the apriori road of the Anselmian proof, it seems, taken as a purely formal argument, to smack of sophistry or a case of begging the question by assuming God's necessary exis- tence. Taken as a formal demonstration it does not convince most people. This does not prove that it is in fact invalid, but its wide- spread lack of persuasive force, even on deeply religious people, is enough to cast serious suspicion on it. Whatever plausibility the ontological proof has seems to rest on an insight that comes to those who are already deeply committed religious believers on other grounds. To Anselm, a man of deep faith, the "proof" is simply a further insight through reason of something which he had already deeply believed on the basis of faith. One has only to read Anselm to see that the "proof" is for him a kind of divinely given insight through reason, that God, to be God, must exist necessarily and could not be a contingent being and still be God. Here one explicates by means of reason what one has already accepted on the basis of a deep religious faith. This is I think what represents the power of the so-called ontological proof. One has only to contrast Anselm with Descartes at this point to see the difference. Descartes attempts to construct a purely formal proof from the "ground up." As a testament of faith the ontological "proof" is a sublime and moving document. As a formal proof it strikes many as a piece of sophistry. Thus we are</page><page sequence="3">30 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION thrown back again to examining the empirical foundations of theism. Let me suggest that unless the belief in God rests at some point on the basis of direct experience, then all talk of God is only an inge- nious philosophical exercise. About this it seems to me the mystics are basically right. Mysticism's contribution to religion is its insis- tence on an experiential foundation for theism. It is this insight that William James tries to formulate and develop in his writings about God and religious experience. At this point we must say something about the term "experience." If one is going to apply the term in religious contexts it is obviously broader than its usage within what has generally been called the empiricist tradition. There are precise senses of "experience" which have been defined in Kantian, positi- vistic or other terms. We choose to use the term in the same spirit and sense in which James used it. We are obviously not subsuming sense contents under concepts in this discussion. In dealing with the empirical approach to theism, we wish to take religious experience, at least to start, in the careful phenomenological sense in which James took it when he drew his cautious conclusions to the Varieties of Religious Experience.2 At this level it is clear that one does not have anything approaching a full fledged Christian theism. One has, as James puts it, a sense of the continuity of our consciousness with a larger consciousness of which it is a part. Even at the conclusion of the Varieties James is careful to keep the discussion on what we would call the phenomenological level, avoiding explicit ontological com- mitment. Let us broaden the scope of this discussion and pass from pheno- menological description to ontological commitment, as the mystics would do immediately and as James himself finally does. Let us assume at this point, for purposes of discussion, that since we feel at certain moments that our consciousness is continuous with a larger consciousness, it is a fact that there is a larger consciousness with which our consciousness is continuous. Such a larger consciousness would, empirically, be a contingent being as much as other contin- gent beings. Let us call this larger consciousness C. No matter with what impact we encounter G, no matter how much our experience of C may be qualified by laudatory value predicates, we have at 2 James, William: Varieties of Religious Experience, London: Longmans Green, 1902, pp. 85-520.</page><page sequence="4">IS EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY ADEQUATE? 3 I best encountered another item of furniture in the world. Unusual, exciting and all important to us in a value sense, C will be another contingent being along with other contingent beings. Of all the things in the world C may rank at the top of the scale of values in the sense of being more valuable than anything else we experience, but C will nevertheless remain contingent. Given this state of affairs is there any reason to equate C with God,, as the divine being has been more or less traditionally conceived? The obvious answer would seem to be "no". God must have special modal status to be God and to equate C with God would be to en- gage in the grossest of category mistakes. This has been the judg- ment of most of the tradition from Anselm through Thomas to Tillich and Hartshorne. On the empirical level alone, the properties of C are much too vague to be equated with God. James, in a very cautious way, seems to draw the minimal conclusion from the evi- dence provided by his varieties of religious experience. The most that James is willing to say, on the basis of the evidence afforded, is that we are in contact with something which we have characterized as C - a larger consciousness continuous with our own. At a later stage, James is willing to identify C with a more determined concept of God. James, Brightman and others, on the basis of religious experience and inference from that experience, have developed doctrines of empirical theism. No matter which concept of God you deal with, whether it be that of James, Brightman, Wieman or somebody else, since the concept is empirically derived, the referent of the concept is a contingent being, and the criticism is that a con- tingent being cannot be an adequate object of worship and cannot be identified with God. Why not? The answer generally given is that a contingent being (C) de- pends on something outside of itself in order to exist. It does not exist always; it comes into being and goes out of being -that is to say it exists at some time or other, but not at all times. Furthermore for any C there is no ultimate reason why C should ever exist at all. Its existence, if it occurs at all, just happens to be the case, and its existence is completely dependent on factors outside of itself. De- pending on what G is, it may be loved, admired, hated, coveted&gt; sought after, but it is not an adequate object of worship; and if C is worshipped, this act would be one of idolatry pure and simple. Thus C is never to be identified with God, though sinful people through</page><page sequence="5">32 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION all time have attempted to identify some C or other with God. An adequate object of worship cannot be one which just happens to come into being, and at some time or other, depending on circum- stances, may cease to be. This is seen in the religious demand that God be absolutely dependable, no matter what. This is a require- ment which no contingent being could fulfill. Furthermore, for any contingent being, even if it be a super-person and loves others now, it is at least logically possible that it might grow tired of others over time, that others might drive it insane or that it might die. All this makes sense when applied to contingent beings, but the tradition will maintain that it makes no sense to think such things of God. Orthodoxy would maintain that in the tradition of empirical theism it would make sense to say "God is dead," but that an adequate theology would understand that the phrase is self-contradictory since God is a necessary being. The most cogent criticism which might be made of the doctrine of a contingent God would be the following. Of any two contingent beings x and y, it is logically possible that at some time or other x should surpass y in ability to love and respond and to manifest power and likewise that y might surpass x in the same way. This would mean that a consequence of empirical theism would be that it be logically possible that the contingent world in whole or in part might at some time or other surpass God in power, love, and the ability to respond. Charles Hartshorne has made the point very clearly that it is essential that God be surpassable only by himself at a future state. Thus again, God would have to be a necessary, not a contingent being. Earlier concepts of God were idolatrous and became clearly inadequate as concepts of divinity. Any morally sensitive human being such as Socrates was seen to be superior to Zeus and the whole tribe of Gods on Mt. Olympus. Earlier concepts of divinity were given up because human spiritual and moral sensi- tivity soon surpassed such concepts - humans were morally superior to gods. Even if one develops a concept of God on an empirical base which surpasses what humans can now achieve or think of achieving, if such a being is conceived contingently, it remains logically possible that at some time or other human spiritual sensitivity might surpass such a being. Thus, such a conceived being could not be God. Thus again, God would have to be conceived non-empirically as that necessary being that is unsurpassable by anything except himself in</page><page sequence="6">IS EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY ADEQUATE? 33 some future state. God must be intrinsically superior to all contin- gent beings - he must be superior in principle, not just in fact; therefore any attempt to develop a purely empirical theism is bound to be misconceived. This is a very strong and cogent criticism. It would seem that the question raised by this paper as to whether an empirical theology is adequate or not should be answered in the negative. Metaphysical- ly empirical theism would seem to be inadequate because God must be given a unique category unto himself. A contingent God would also be religiously inadequate for it would seem implausible to worship a being that might cease to exist, or which might lose in- terest or a being which one might conceivably surpass. One could love and appreciate such a being - we do this with other persons, but worship is something else again. Yet when all is said and done I am not sure that nothing can be said for empirical theology. I have indicated the most stringent arguments against it because I do think they have a telling force, but I also think that to turn one's back on the tradition of empirical theism is a mistake - that we have much to learn from it even though we may have to reject it as the last word in theism. The question of what an adequate object of religious worship is psychologically is not an easy or precise notion to explicate. What may be adequate for one person may not be adequate for another. It depends very much on the state of the person's spiritual develop- ment. Some find a grossly anthropomorphic God adequate; others do not. What does seem to be the case is that as spiritual develop- ment continues, concepts of God with which we may have started seem inadequate and are replaced by others or not replaced at all. If it is true that a little thinking turns one away from God and that further thinking brings you back, the divinity to which you return is not the same as the one with which you started. What does seem apparent here is that a contingent being (C) could very well be an adequate object of worship psychologically for many people. All I mean here is that only philosophers talk about contingency and necessity. Most worshippers worship the object of their devotion without thinking about this question at all. But all this says is that idolatry is actual and is practiced by people who do not even know it is idolatry and who couldn't care less. Thus, the question of what is psychologically an adequate object of worship is not very helpful</page><page sequence="7">34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION in discussing empirical theism. Many people feel drugs are adequate, but this says nothing as to whether they really are or not. The signi- ficant issue is that orthodoxy will maintain that no contingent being is metaphysically an adequate object of worship, regardless of what the worshipper may think, for the reasons we mentioned earlier. Whether God is contingent or necessary has nothing whatever to do with what people psychologically expect or desire. It is a meta- physical question concerning the mode of God's existence. Either there is no God in reality or God exists in a very special sense - necessarily. At this point it looks as though I have argued myself back into support of Anselm's proof and have deserted empiricism alto- gether. But one must be careful here. I said earlier that I rejected Anselm's argument as a proof, for a proof of anything, if it works, should work either within or outside of a faith context. I am inclined to accept Anselm's argument as a statement of faith, based on a rational insight into what one already deeply believes on the basis of revelation or mystical encounter. Within the circle of faith, An- selm's argument explicates rationally what the mature believer must feel about God. Outside the prior commitment of faith, the Ansel- mian argument makes no sense and appears as an ingenious logical exercise. Thus I would still reject it as a proof or an argument, for these are supposed to hold whether one is in the circle of faith or not. Thus no one can prove God's existence. Discussion of God's mode of existence makes sense only to those already in faith. It is precisely at this point that the importance of empirical ap- proaches to theism becomes relevant. If God is a necessary being, he has contingent empirical aspects and Hartshorne's dipolar theism has shown how these notions can be consistently applied to God. At this point I revert strongly to the spirit of James' broadened empiri- cism. For both the believer and the unbeliever, experience is a crucial factor in discussing God or anything else worthwhile. While God may be uniquely categorized, this does not mean that he is purely and only a creature of revealed doctrine or of rational argument. It is the exclusively latter approach which makes so much talk about God seem sterile and academic. James and the mystics are right - unless the concept of God is derived in some sense from experience the whole exercise is pointless. Thus, while empirical theology is clearly inadequate in certain important respects, we will not have given it its fair due by simply answering our opening question negati-</page><page sequence="8">IS EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY ADEQUATE? 35 vely. It is inadequate if it stands alone, but empiricism is essential to any healthy and coherent theistic viewpoint. It is the positive aspect of the task to which we must now turn. The lifeblood of religion is direct encounter with the divine. While theology may explicate the nature of God, it would remain a purely formal and empty discipline unless it were constantly renewed by first hand religious experience. While most religious believers are not mystics, the phenomenon of religious experience is much more widespread than might be supposed both inside and outside the confines of religious orthodoxy. The attempt to explicate this ex- perience in rational terms has produced the classical arguments for God's existence and the discussions about the modality of that existence. Remove this experiential source and these discussions stand out as sterile and empty. This is why the man untouched by faith quite rightly rejects the arguments as attempts to convince him. You can discuss these questions rationally and philosophically, but they do not make any sense unless one has been touched by faith and then what such discussion does is explicate what the belie- ver has already felt through direct experience. To speak of a proof is to put the matter the wrong way round. When Anselm and his readers compare notes it becomes a question of saying, "Yes, I have been touched by God, and given my experience, it would seem as though God must be a necessary being." One must be careful here. The experience does not prove God any more than the rational argument does. The rational explication carries conviction to the man touched by faith as indicating what he deeply feels already. One sees this quite clearly if one reads Anselm's account which is given in a devotional context addressed to God. If one does not see it as an explication of religious experience, the "argument" is dead and sterile and it remains so no matter how ingeniously Hartshorne, Malcolm, and others try to make it work. William James is one of the most underrated and unduly neg- lected thinkers. There are many incisive insights throughout his writings and nowhere is he better than in his insistence on the im- portance of experience as a basis for religion. His classic work on the varieties of religious experience plus his own spiritual searching bears this out. If one simply says that empirical theology is inade- quate and leaves it at that, one does this type of theology a great injustice. To paraphrase from another context one might say that if</page><page sequence="9">36 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION theology does not end in experience, it must begin with experience. This is the great lesson of James. His significance lies not only in his deep appreciation for the religious dimension of experience, but his willingness to try to draw some conclusions from the wealth of data which he collected on religious experiences. In dealing with the varieties of experience which occur in different traditions, he finds a common nucleus running through the testimony to the effect that the mystics feel there is something wrong with us in our natural condition and that a solution whereby we may be saved from this condition does exist.3 There is also general agreement that there is something "more" than simply our finite consciousness - that there is a larger consciousness of some kind which really exists, though there is of course disagreement as to the nature of this larger con- sciousness. At one level James is aware that this "more" may be viewed as a continuation of our conscious selves on the unconscious level. He knows that there is more to our total self than we are at any time aware of. At the same time James does not share a widespread assumption that whatever occurs "inside my head" so to speak is necessarily subjective. In other words, because the divine dimension is an "inner" experience, it does not follow that it could not refer to something objective outside the finite self. James takes quite seriously the mystics' feeling that invasions from the subconscious region suggest an external source for this feeling. James also takes seriously the possibility that mystical experience opens up a new dimension of fact to us. This is the contribution which empirical theology must make - to take religious experience as something more than simply aberrant psychological phenomena. James goes even further and implies that the hypothesis of a divine agency, if it is taken seriously, must really make some significant differences in experience.4 In other words he implies that there should be some verifiable consequences to the religious hypothesis. Unfortunately James's notion of verification is frightfully vague and totally psychologistic - involving differences that the belief in God would make to a person's life. In the light of contemporary concepts of what is required of verification, one would have to say that verifi- 3 James, William: "Conclusions on Varieties of Religious Experience" from Essays in Pragmatism, New York: Hafner Publishing Co., 1948, pp. 125. 4 James, William: from Essays in Pragmatism, New York: Hafner Publishing Co., 1948, p. 136.</page><page sequence="10">IS EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY ADEQUATE? 37 cation is not applicable to religious hypotheses. This is why I say that epistemically, the most that religious experience can do is to suggest or give what I call intimations of divinity. To make stronger epistemological claims from an empiricist base seems to me to be unjustifiable. But if the most that we can get from experience are intimations of divinity, they are still intimations of an objective consciousness which exists, and James is to be commended for not fudging on this point. Religious experience points towards what may be taken as a genuine divine element of reality. It is precisely at this point that empirical theology needs supple- mentation by both faith and reason; by faith, for genuine religion commits itself to much more than simply intimations of the divine ; by reason, because once one has entered the circle of faith, one must consider the question as to which concept of divinity most adequately coheres with our experience and with our religious yearning. James begins but does not complete this task. Charles Hartshorne, as much as anyone in our own time has devoted his energies to trying to explicate what an adequate concept of divinity would be. What this involves of course is not an exclusive reliance on experience, for as we have seen God's peculiar modal status requires a rational develop- ment which goes beyond the bounds of experience, even interpre- ting it in its broadest Jamesian terms. Still it must be remembered that we "see through a glass darkly" on these matters and thus to speak of "proof" is to go far beyond what epistemology would justify. It is empirical theology in the Jamesian spirit which should serve as the base for our intellectual endeavors in the religious realm, and at the same time it is this base which should curb our pretentions to have demonstrated more than we really have. Hartshorne, it seems to me, ignores this caution which an empiricist theology should engender, for he believes that one can prove God's existence in the strongest of epistemic terms - namely by a purely formal demonstra- tion. Things are simply not this clear in relation to God. Here the more cautious approach of Whitehead and James would seem to be preferable. Empirical theology is the only link where discussion between the man of faith and the man who lacks faith can occur. James' Will To Believe** is a classic case in point. In this grossly misunderstood article 5 James, William: "The Will to Believe" from Essays in Pragmatism, New York: Hafner Publishing Co., 1948, pp. 88-110.</page><page sequence="11">38 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION James does not try to prove something to the nonbeliever. He sets out certain factors in his own experience, which might be common to the experience of others and indicates an option of the right to believe. James later regretted that he had not given this title to the article, as it would have lead to less misunderstanding of his posi- tion. In his article The Sentiment of Rationality*, James talks of the sentiment as a deep common urge in human experience generally for things to make sense. Here he takes a factor common in much human experience and tries to indicate why this might give us intimations of divinity. The best religious philosophy is of this kind. In the Phaedo, Plato indicates common human experiences which point towards an element or radical transcendence in man. There are things in human life that point beyond pure animal existence. Kant says that if the purpose of human existence was to provide happiness the universe did a poor job of it, intimating that perhaps human existence has other purposes than happiness. These are the kinds of things that I mean by intimations of divinity - intimations because there is no attempt to prove God, but simply indications from human experience that a divine element might be present. They remain as no more than intimations unless and until one is touched by direct experience of the divine. Empirical theism at its best is of this nature and should not be dis- missed. It may help begin the process of religious exploration and it always serves as the foundation for later theological explication. In the beginning of the paper we saw why it was not adequate as the last word in theism. The nature of God and his mode of existence need thorough explication. Nevertheless if theism, when launched, cuts off its empirical base and tries to float alone in a pure rational or revealed context, it can lead to patent absurdities. Only if one ignored experience could one come up with the peculiar doctrine of God's complete immutability to change and omnipotence in every respect. The doctrine of complete immutability makes nonsense of prayer life, divine response and religious experience, and the doctri- ne of absolute omnipotence makes a solution of the problem of evil impossible. Hartshorne's dipolar theism takes experience into ac- count again and gives us a more intelligible doctrine of divine im- 6 James, William: "The Sentiment of Rationality" from Essays in Pragmatism, New York: Hafner Publishing Co., 1948, pp. 3-37.</page><page sequence="12">IS EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY ADEQUATE? 39 mutability and omnipotence than the doctrines that ignore expe- rience. Thus in this type of approach the insights of Augustinian theology cohere with experience instead of blatantly clashing against it. James' doctrine of a finite God is also an attempt to make his intimations of divinity cohere with experience. The strongest reason for adopting the notion of a finite God is the problem of evil. If God is completely omnipotent in all respects then there is no way to absolve him from responsibility for evil short of abandoning at- tempts to make rational sense of the problem. If God gave man free will, still he knew what he was doing and cannot be absolved of ultimate responsibility for man's sins, even though man too may be to blame. Evil being a fact, if one is to preserve God's goodness, which is essential, then one must limit his power. James saw this and courageously drew the conclusion that this is a pluralistic open ended universe with God growing as well. My main point here is that James tries to make his doctrine cohere with experience instead of running against it. This does not necessa- rily make his view true. Many think that he paid too high a price, and I agree. Whitehead and Hartshorne provide a more adequate accommodation to experience than James does at this point. In- stead of simply opting for a finite God, a solution which has difficul- ties of its own, dipolar theism makes more rational and empirical sense by dividing God's nature into two aspects - an eternal and immutable aspect and a changing one. Thus it is more coherent to have a God who is finite-infinite than simply a finite God. While the Whiteheadean view is more adequate than that of James, all of these views are in the tradition of empirical theology. Whitehead and Hartshorne are superior to James on this point because the two former thinkers take into consideration God's unique modal status. James' finite God would be another case of a contingent superior being G, of whom we spoke earlier. To preserve the insight that God must be in a special category and yet at the same time not desert the empirical foundation for theism, the dipolar view is much superior. God is necessary and absolute in his primordial nature but empirical with contingent aspects in his consequent nature. There is a further crucial point on which James and the view of dipolar theism must agree and which is a major departure from orthodoxy. This is that God is genuinely limited in power over the world. In the orthodox view God is limited only by the logically</page><page sequence="13">40 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION absurd. For James, God is clearly a contingent being among other contingent beings in a pluralistic universe which is open ended and growing. For Whitehead God and the world mutually require each other - no world, no God ; no God, no world. God operates as a lure for feeling who by persuasion presents possibilities to actual occasions. In Whitehead's view God from his complete omnipotence does not give freedom to man and to the created world. God's control over the world is limited essentially even though he is absolute and eternal in certain aspects. Hartshorne seems committed to the same view, though I have the impression that he would like to hold a position closer to orthodoxy on this point. It would seem to me that any coherent theistic view would have to opt for an essentially finite aspect of God in order to make sense of the problem of evil. Orthodox views make an elaborate dodge on this issue. The most usual gambit is to say that God chose to give men their freedom and thus it is the sins of man that account for evil, but not God. I will restrict my discussion here to the problem of moral evils committed by men, which is difficult enough, without going into the problem of so-called natural evil. It is added that it is preferable to have a world of free moral agents (persons) who can choose evil rather than a world of programmed robots who cannot help being good. I would grant the latter point but I don't see how this helps orthodoxy with the problem of evil. If God's power is limited only by what is logi- cally absurd then even if he made men and gave them freedom he knew what would be likely to happen and he is as indirectly respon- sible for evil as the mother who lets her child wander into the fire in the hope that it will learn from the experience. The nearest approach to a plausible solution on orthodox terms would seem to lie in developing Leibniz's doctrine of compossibility and the best of all possible worlds. God might not only be limited by the logically possible but by what is compossible as well. In Leibniz's view God has created the best of all possible worlds. Then it is not a question of God's giving men freedom to sin and being indirectly responsible for it. One must simply say that it is not compossible both to have persons and immunity to free choice to sin, and it is clearly desirable to have persons. Evil exists, but if you are going to have a world, you are going to have evil and this is not a real limit on God's power. Just as it does not limit God that he cannot make a round square, so it does not limit God that he cannot make a world</page><page sequence="14">IS EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY ADEQUATE? 4 1 and have it devoid of evil.7 God could remain infinite in all meaning- ful respects and one would begin to have a plausible solution to the problem of evil. Leibniz's approach is one of the most profound on this point in western thought and like James, he has been cruelly misinterpreted. There is a limit to what is compossible. This is the element of tragedy in the world. We have constantly assumed that the world was like a collection of marbles where we could throw out the ones we didn't like and add ones we did, as though it wouldn't make any difference to the rest of the pile. The main weakness in Leibniz's view is his contention that this is in fact the best of all possible worlds. It is essential for him to maintain this in order to absolve God from responsibility for evil. While there are clearly limits to how perfect a world might become, surely we have far from reached them or else all attempts at social change are meaningless. Indeed in any world at all where action is to take place, it must be possible that it could really be better than it is at present or the whole concept of action would be meaningless. Thus if any world could be better than the one that exists at present, then if one holds onto the orthodox doc- trine of God, one can always ask, "If God is infinite in power why didn't he make it better than it is?" In the end the Leibnizian view falls short of solving the problem. His view will work only if this is in fact the best of all possible worlds, and we have reason to think that it is not. This does not detract from Leibniz's profound insight that there are built-in limits to perfectibility in terms of what is com- possible. Thus I see no coherent way to deal with the problem of evil, given the orthodox view unless one forsakes the attempt to make some rational sense of it altogether. If one is to stop asking why God didn't make it better than it is, the only way to do this is to regard God as essentially finite in certain crucial respects. At the same time to make him finite in certain respects is not to view him as a contingent being, like other finite beings. Again the dipolar view seems to make the most sense of these various threads, to maintain the profound insights of orthodoxy and at the same time cohere with our deepest empirical insights. The problem of evil and the finite God is only 7 See my "God, Goodness and a Morally Perfect World" in The Personalist, Vol. 46, No. 3, Summer 1965.</page><page sequence="15">42 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION one example of many where a theism grounded in religious expe- rience can aid in arriving at a more coherent doctrine of God than can occur without it. The doctrine of the finite-infinite God also takes some account of revealed truths and rational insight into what a doctrine of God requires. Neither empirical nor non-empirical theism is adequate by itself. A combination of both seems to be what is called for. What seems needed is the thorough grounding of theology and philosophy of religion in religious experience, no matter how vague and amorphous this may be. Otherwise theology becomes simply a logical exercise in dogmatism. Thus empirical theology is an essential aspect in any adequate religious view; however, supple- mentation and "filling out" by reason and possibly by revelation is necessary. I say possibly revelation, but I want to leave the question of revealed truth aside because recourse to such truth falls outside the bounds of philosophical justification, and it is only the latter with which I am dealing. The use of reason as applied to theistic doctrine falls well within the purview of philosophical discussion. From the intimations of divinity from all times and places and from the more dramatic kinds of religious experiences, we are encouraged to try to explicate a rational doctrine of the divine which will be true to our deepest religious insights and thus coherent with expe- rience. While the concept of the divine is grounded in experience, our deepest insights seem to indicate that the divine falls under a special category and is not to be identified with any contingent being or beings. A not only unsurpassed, but an unsurpassable source of value is indeed something special. David Platt Wilson College</page></plain_text>
