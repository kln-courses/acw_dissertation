<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOLD TREASURE AT VARNA By MARIJA GIMBUTAS The amount site acclaim is often of accorded gold commensurate excavated an archaeological from to the it. This site is often commensurate to the amount of gold excavated from it. This holds true for such famous ancient cities as Troy, Ur and Mycenae. The city of Varna and its prehistoric cemetery located on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria may now be added to that distinguished group. Worldwide attention has recently been focused on the sensational treasure trove so far recovered from eighty-one of its graves. The extraordinary works of gold, copper, marble and shell verify the technological achievements and trading expertise of an advanced stage of an Old European civilization that predates Troy II by 1,500 years and Mycenae by 2,500 years. This culture, dating to approximately 6500-4000 b.c., encompasses the Neolithic and Copper Age of a non-Indo-European group in southeastern Europe. The cemetery at Varna is associated with the "Karanovo" or East Balkan bloc of this Old European civilization and was in use at the end of the fifth millennium b.c. The roots of this particular cultural bloc go back to approximately 6000 b.c. or soon thereafter when full fledged Neolithic villages emerged in the Marica valley of central Bulgaria. Lasting until about 4000 b.c., its name is derived from the tell at Karanovo near Nova Zagora, excavated in the 1950*8 by V. Mikov and Georgi I. Georgiev of the Archaeological Museum in Sofia. The chronology of the cemetery of Varna is based on recalibrated radiocarbon dates from contemporary settlements of the fourth phase of the East Balkan Karanovo culture dating to approximately 4800-4000 b.c. The dates from other typical Karanovo sites - Azmak, Karanovo, Gumelnija, Cäscioarele, Sitagroi and Goljamo Delchevo - range from 4500-4000 b.c. and the material from Varna also corresponds to the final phase of this period. Until now our knowledge of East Balkan prehistory has come chiefly from habitation sites excavated in the River Marica valley during the 1950*8. There are only two other contemporaneous cemeteries, Devnya and Goljamo Delchevo, known in this region. Two cemeteries representing an earlier phase of the same culture have been excavated in Romania, namely Radovanu on the Danube and Cernica in Bucharest. MARIJA GIMBUTAS is Professor of European Archaeology and curator of Old World Archaeology at the University of California at Los Angeles. She has excavated Neolithic sites at Obre in Bosnia , Anza in Macedonia and Achilleion in Thessaly. She is also archaeology editor of The Journal of Indo-European Studies and is working on a book dealing with the signs , symbols and ideograms of Neolithic southeastern Europe. The author would like to thank the excavator of the Varna Cemetery , Ivan Ivanov , for permission to photograph the artifacts and to Professor Alexandre Fol of the Committee of Art and Culture , Bulgarian Academy of Sciences , for the invitation to view the finds. 44</page><page sequence="2">Old Europe in the fifth millennium b.c.

Varna lies within the area of the Karanovo civilization. Major sites of the Karanovo VI period in the Lower Danube and Marica plains yielding materials related to those from Varna. ^^Ttie first pieces of the Varna treasure were discovered in November 1972 when workmen digging a terrace at Lake Varna chanced upon a grave pit containing a total of two hundred and twenty- two gold objects. The workmen erroneously identified the gold artifacts as copper when they reported their find to the local museum at Dylgopol and offered to dispose of the "trinkets" if the museum was not interested. The Varna Archaeological Museum investigated the "copper" objects and immediately started excavations under the supervision of Mikhail Lazarov, the museum's director, and Ivan Ivanov, a Chalcolithic specialist from the same museum. During the 1973-1976 seasons eighty-one graves constituting about one-half of the cemetery were opened. There are no 45</page><page sequence="3">Kenotaph grave No. 4 with funerary gifts in situ: vases and tools mark the area designating the head and shoulders of the missing skeleton. A large rectangular gold plate, massive armringsf convex plates , rings , and pendants represent the chest area of the deceased. sepulchral structures above or within the graves which are deep pits measuring 1.5 to two meters in width with rounded corners. Until analysis of skeletal materials is completed, one can not speak conclusively about burial rites. It is striking, however, that all of the dead are buried in either extended or contracted positions with their heads oriented toward the sea and, with few exceptions, they are accompanied by jewelry, tools, figurines and marble and ceramic wares. Graves equipped only with vases appear to belong exclusively to females buried in a contracted position. A particularly fascinating aspect of the grave pits is that nearly one-third of them lacked human bones, but contained funeral gifts arranged as if a skeleton were present. One such grave contains a stone axe with a tubular gold shaft placed at a spot marking the right shoulder of the missing skeleton. Accompanying grave goods include massive gold armrings, large oblong and retangular gold plates, necklaces, rings, pendants, a set of copper tools, and gold plates which originally may have studded a fabric garment. The area designated for the head of the absent skeleton was surrounded by a gold- painted dish, a globular vase, and 46 masses of shell, stone and gold beads. All the grave goods were present as if a body had been buried with the treasures. One intriguing Varna discovery that is certain to create a long dialogue between religious historians and cultural anthropologists is the so-called "Mask-graves" which also contain no human bones. The predominant feature of these sixteen pits are the life-size clay masks decorated with gold attributes found in the graves. Two gold discs represented the eyes, and a horizontal gold plate with a row of seven or more gold nails below apparently signified a mouth and teeth. A golden diadem rested on the area where the forehead may have been. Earrings attached to pierced clay earlobes, and ring-shaped pendants with "eyes" were suspended on either side of the chin. The face depicted on the masks is the same found on a certain type of East Balkan figurine. The pendants with "eyes" are a stereotype abstraction of the human female figurine widely distributed throughout the Danubian and Carpathian region. The function of these pendants was unclear, however, until theý were found in situ attached to the chins of the Varna masks.

In addition, thousands of gold beads were recovered from the "Mask-graves" as well as very delicate gold pins with quadrangular heads, copper needles and awls, masses of Aegean dentalium shells, carnelian and other stone beads, bone pins, spindle whorls, dishes and rhytons of marble, flint knives and sickles. The "Mask-graves" may possibly have been ritual tombs for the Goddess who was responsible for life and death. Called the "Goddess of Life, Death and Regeneration," she was one of the major figures in the pantheon of gods of a society deeply concerned with the problems of the life and death cycle. The images of this deity, consisting of figurines in a stiff posture with folded arms and an accentuated pubic triangle or "womb," were put in graves to stimulate and perpetuate the procreative powers of the deceased. The goddess gave life to the dead; birth symbols - eggs, uteri, moon 47</page><page sequence="5">Sacrificial offerings from grave No. 36: solid gold axe with gold-plated shaft ; stylized gold-plated bull horns , gold beads , embossed and perforated bull figurines, gold armrings, convex plates along with a beaded gold shaft. crescents, horns, helixes, whirls - were consistently painted or engraved on ritual vases and other equipment used in her worship. The Karanovo, as well as the Cucuteni, Vinca and other Old European groups throughout the fifth millennium b.c. worshiped this female deity. 48 The Varna clay masks with their gold decorations may figure in burial rites associated with her. Perhaps the representative mask was buried simultaneously with the interment of the dead in order to ensure rebirth.

From grave No. 3. regeneration are found both in the symbolic designs painted in graphite or gold on large dishes and the lidded globular vases from these pits. The whirl pattern motif of helixes and "uteri" (or placentas) decorating Varna wares is a four-corner composition of symbols commonly associated with this female deity. Another common find at Varna are T-shaped figurines of bone or marble with the eyes, breasts, and pubis decorated by gold plates. These sculptures are probably stylized abstractions of the same masked deity represented in the "Mask-graves." The other figurines found at Varna are less schematic: a bone carving of the human female from grave Number forty-one exhibits a neatly modeled abdomen and legs with a large triangular pubis emphasized by dots. Stylized differentiations were seemingly made according to the scale or medium of reproduction. So profound was the veneration of this deity at Varna and in other prehistoric societies of Old Europe that her image pervaded both life and death - figurines were used during a lifetime and buried at death, along with the spectacular gold and clay masks. Another grave, Number thirty-six, also attests to the great influence of this and other goddesses in prehistoric Europe. The plethora of funeral goods found there was probably symbolic sacrificial gifts for the goddesses, and included a solid gold axe with gold-plated shaft, two bull figurines and thirty bull horns plated in gold, a beaded gold shaft, and gold attachments intended for the mask of the Goddess. Other gold offerings were a double-banded armring, embossed and perforated convex plates, beads, earrings, insignia in the form of a crooked stab and the letter "V," a sheep astragalus made of gold, and six pendant-shaped abstractions of the Goddess. The discovery of the sheep astragalus in gold and its association with the golden V suggests that the contents of grave thirty-six included offerings not only to the Goddess of Life, Death and Regeneration, but also the Bird Goddess, the Giver of Nourishment who was worshiped in the Upper Paleolithic, Neolithic, Copper Age and later. Her sacred animal was a ram and later the sheep. The grave also contained a copper shaft-hole axe, flint knife, saw, marble dish, copper needle, and four lidded pots. 49</page><page sequence="7">Dentalium shells, carnelian and other stone beads, convex plates of gold , and gold heads from grave No. 4. ^íome of the most important finds at Varna were the large dishes found in the "Mask-graves" having a helix pattern painted with a thin application of gold or graphite. These ceramics are a unique example of gold painting on clay in Europe and for all the Old World. The technical aspects of this complex method have not yet been fully studied, although numerous examples of graphite painting are known from the East and Central Balkans. Dating mainly from the fifth millennium b.c., this practice seems to have been widespread. Excavations at Azmak in central Bulgaria have uncovered cone-shaped lumps of graphite, within the houses, ready for drawing. Analysis of graphite-decorated pottery shows that it was produced by a complex process: kilns reached a temperature of about 1000° Centigrade and wares were fired in a reducing atmosphere following the application of graphite to a dry, burnished surface. The gold-painted wares were 50 probably produced in a similar way with a gold powder used to apply the gold tones. One gold painted bowl from Varna is especially beautiful (see page 49). The amount of gold jewelry amassed in a number of grave pits belonging to the men buried at Varna is unprecedented for this period. The male skeleton in grave Number forty-three, for example, was showered with three gold necklaces, three massive gold armrings on each arm, two gold earrings for each ear, six small gold hairrings, three large double-perforated gold discs, two oblong gold plates, several oblong plates apparently sewn on a garment and a large gold disc and biconical beads. Gold nails and gold plate mountings were also present. A three-legged, pear-shaped vase decorated with bands of symbolic "uteri" was placed beside the head of the deceased. The very similar inventories of graves Number four and Number fourteen are comparable to this impressive assemblage.</page><page sequence="8">They all must have been graves of leading members of the community who were buried around the same time and with similar goods. The most significant feature of the Varna cemetery is the extraordinary volume and variety of treasures contained in the graves: copper, gold, marble, graphite, obsidian and spondylus and dentalium shells among them. These nondomestic commodities aptly verify that Varna was an important trade center of the Karanovo civilization. Metal trace analyses of the copper objects have revealed that the metal came from mines at Aibunar in central Bulgaria, located about eight kilometers south of Stara Zagora, which was excavated by E.N. Chernykh of the Archaeological Institute in Moscow in 1972 and 1974. Considering their early period, the construction and productivity of the Aibunar mines is remarkable. Eleven shafts exceeding five hundred meters in length had a capacity to produce thousands of tons of copper used by smiths of the Karanovo culture, as well as the northern groups, the Cucuteni and Dnieper-Donets. The analysis of the gold at Varna has not yet been completed, but the source will probably be traced to the Transylvanian Alps of Romania. The quarries in southern Bulgaria are believed to have supplied Varna craftsmen with marble. The spondylus and dentalium shells were imported from the Aegean. A nearly transparent obsidian blade found in grave Number forty-one is very likely Carpathian in origin. Graphite comes from central Bulgaria. All this speaks for lively trade activities between the Danubian and Carpathian regions, the Aegean and Black Sea coasts, the Dardenelles and Cyclades. Varna appears to have been a harbor where a wealth of gold, copper, shells, marble and obsidian arrived and were shipped to the west, north and south. The people of Varna obviously managed extensive trade relations, specialized in crafts, produced sophisticated art and were technologically developed. Before being infiltrated by tribes from the steppes north of the Black Sea, Varna was a vital cultural center of the Balkan peninsula during the fifth millennium. The gold funerary equipment found there is a silent testimony to an Old European middle class that was both creative and prosperous.
