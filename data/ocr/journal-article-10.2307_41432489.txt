Penguin-Pedia recounts David Salomon's "long journey to become a friend of the penguins." After spending two years visiting 17 species of penguins and photographing them, Salomon conceived the idea for this book to convey penguin information easily to children, penguin enthusiasts, and college students. He set out to combine his photo- graphs with what is known about each species in hopes of increasing penguin awareness and thus contributing to protecting them. Penguin-Pedia has something for most audiences. The stimulating layout of pen- guin pictures and bright colors along with "David's Observations" - a section written in the first person about the author's ex- periences and opinions - will entertain the recreational reader. A specific section in the beginning of the book, "Where to Find a Penguin", instructs penguin enthusiasts how to visit penguins in the wild. The au- thor gives directions from Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas to at least one penguin colony of each species and includes an approximate cost for each trip. The species-specific chapters are divided into easy-to-read life history seg- ments, and the end of each chapter contains a life table constructed from several sources. To increase awareness on the "dire state" (p. 4) of the penguins, the author included a "Conservation Efforts" section in each spe- cies chapter to encourage readers to help penguins. The author points out that to pro- tect penguins we must know their population numbers and how they live, stop oil spills, regulate commercial fishing, restore habitat, protect breeding grounds from human in- teractions and invasive species, and reduce global warming impacts. Even if there is nothing new here, the task is still a large one. The pictures are interesting and make the book a page-turner, but the informal writing style, filled as it is with colloquial- isms and anthropomorphic statements, de- tracts from the seriousness of the problems facing penguins, as well as the value of the observations. Ultimately, the light tone un- dermines the scientific integrity of the text making it less appropriate for scholarly study. Also, the lack of literature references makes it difficult to fact-check ideas that are not commonly agreed upon, and there are many common facts that are reported incorrectly. For example, Salomon writes that "the [Magellanic] female lays two eggs, usually two days apart." (p. 95) and "[Mag- ellanic] Females mostly fight and injure other females over their choice of mate." (p. 98). But none of this is true. Female Mag- ellanic penguins lay eggs on average four days apart and hatch chicks two days apart (Rebstock and Boersma 2011). Males usu- ally fight males, and although females will fight on occasion it is not over mates as much as the nest (Renison et al 2002, 2003, 2006) . The author provides some references for weights and measurements, but doesn't mention that sources use different meth- ods, which makes comparisons problematic. With that said, Penguin-Pedia super- sedes other books of its type (Peterson 1979, Sparks and Soper 1987, Lynch 2007) that are available and readable to gen- eral audiences, but is not comparable to more academic books like Williams 1995 or Davis and Renner 2003. The author succeeded in constructing a book fit for a variety of age groups and audiences. How- ever, undergraduate college students are not likely to be among that readership. Olivia J. Kane and P.
