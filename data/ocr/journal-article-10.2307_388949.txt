<plain_text><page sequence="1">M. Dh6tel se contente de nommer les choses. Et quelles choses! Le langage reste colle a un signifie de carton pate. Helas (ou peut-etre heureusement), le mot fianqailles ne suffit pas a faire rever le lecteur, et il aimerait peut-etre quelques precisions sur cette beaute si incomparable qu'elle epargne la fatigue d'une metaphore comme d'ailleurs celle d'une description. Nous craignons que l'incomparable ne soit aussi incommunicable et par conse- quent inutile de meme d'ailleurs que le livre tout entier. La seule question qu'il reste a se poser est celle-ci: comment l'auteur de quarante-neuf ouvrages (si nous avons bien compte), titulaire de trois prix litteraires, peut-il ignorer a ce point les ressources de sa propre langue? Boston University Nicholas Kostis ETCHERELLI, CLAIRE. Un Arbre voyageur. Paris: Gallimard, 1978. Pp. 339. Like Etcherelli's prize-winning Elise ou la uraie vie (Denoel, 1967), Un Arbre voyageur is a feminist variation on the Bildungsroman. In both, a woman achieves selfhood through reclaiming her political roots in the working class. The novel has two parts. In the first and shorter, Anna relates her life in Paris and her relationship to Milie, conveying her own self- possession and Milie's dependence. The second part depicts Milie and her illegitimate brood in the small village where she has exiled herself. A major digression treats Milie's childhood, with the novel ending by picking up the story of Milie's love affair with a village local and testing it against the "revolution" of '68. This capsule summary in no way encompasses the novel's thematic complexity, nor its ambitious mixture of styles and chronological juxtaposi- tions-characteristics which will discourage the reader who admired the lucid story-telling in Elise. Milie's drama- the woman alone learning to take charge of her life- provides the frame on which Etcherelli hangs all the recent bogeymen of French political history. Milie experiences the Algerian War as a tragedy which robs her of her first lover. Her third, an alcoholic poet, is a product of the failed dream of Breton nationalism. Her own exploitation in the cantines and small industries where she is sometimes able to find work most vividly criticizes an economic structure which condemns the poor to even more poverty. Milie's is a world peopled with militants and their causes: Marta and Orlando, Latin American revolutionaries who participate in the Prague Spring; Serge, "un dur" so in love with the Communist ideal of the family that he can commit adultery only on uncarpeted floors. Filtered through Milie, these characters give density to our understanding of her liberation. The events of May give her the focus which makes this liberation inevitable. Etcherelli develops her novel through an original mixture of narration and description as in the following passage where Anna recounts her leave-taking from Milie: "Je partais le lendemain [narration-past action]. Gene de ces instances oiu se materialise un changement de l'existence. [description-emotion] Charnieres grin:antes [description-sound], la porte tourne [narration/descriptive substitution], je vais passer le seuil derriere moi [narration- present action], Milie vulnerable [description-sight and emotion]. Et sa fragilite me donne la mesure de mes forces intactes [commentary]" (p. 8). This technique, however, grows tiring; and the descriptive shorthand distances the reader from the characters. The rare pronouns tend to depersonalize the experience. In the second part of the book when she switches to a third-person narrative, Etcherelli's writing resembles stage directions or a cameraman's script: "Milie boutonna son impermeable et prit une pomme pour la route.... S'y refletaient les ouvertures du ciel bas. De ces nacres mauves, bleutees parfois, dans lesquelles on cherche a lire les presages de sa journee. Silence de la campagne. Quelques moteurs lointains sur des routes au dela des pres. Marcher allegrement" (p. 89). The author accumulates these mises en scene without activating them. Furthermore, she builds by digressions, regularly introducing characters and events without any points of reference. This "associative development" demands that the reader store up bits of information in hopes of piecing them together later. Therefore it is a relief to reach the 792 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">straightforward and more conventional narrative which conveys Milie's history in the central section of the second part. Etcherelli is the most affecting in her responsiveness to nature, from which she borrows the title and the image for Milie's rebirth-Milie, an arbre voyageur who moves from place to place, from man to man, unable to put down roots-Milie, herself a proletarian Mother Nature, harboring all sorts of strange birds until they gaih enough strength to fly away. The medlar tree which graces Milie's yard becomes a double on which to project her frustrations and fears. Living in an anthropomorphic world, she is nonetheless aware of being caught up in a pathetic fallacy; "la vraie vie" ultimately exists in dirty, crowded Belleville and the twentieth arrondissement. Her return to her working-class roots provokes the triumphant and terrestrial metaphor with which Etcherelli closes the novel: "Germination/la fin d'Hiver approche/Terre figee tu vas craquer.. . " (p. 339). To read this novel well, we should take a hint from nature's cycle and go back to the beginning which will now make sense. Even so, and despite Etcherelli's obvious pleasure in the earth, her delicate characters remain forever disembodied and cerebral. University of Wisconsin, Madison Judith G. Miller FAYE, JEAN PIERRE. Verres. Paris: Seghers/Laffont, 1977. Pp. 199. 49 F. It would be misplaced to attempt to measure the relative degree of Jean Pierre Faye's attachment to the shifting, for him symbiotically related realms of poetry, fiction and theatre, not to mention those of politics and openly discursive or expository articulation. For many years now Faye's work has shown itself to be operating, with brilliant and combative originality, at that essential and yet elusive point where not only does the world leave its "impression" upon and through language, but language itself "bites into" the world, bares its dangerous, yet beautiful trenchancy, its vital, yet vulnerable power of interaction and change. If Faye continually "returns" to poetry-Fleuve renverse appeared in 1960, followed by Couleurs pliees in 1965 and now this collation into "un ensemble qui se deploie" of previously written pieces dating back some ten years-it is perhaps because it is there that the submersion in language, the sense of the mutually beneficial imbrication and interference of reality and language, the provocation and subversiveness, though also the sheer exhilaration, of this reciprocal movement may be most completely, most poignantly experienced. But poetry is at best a privileged locus and mode of expression and Faye's other writings demonstrate very clearly that it is all of language, that "non-place that lights up all places," that preoccupies him, which he seeks to explore and deploy, forcing it to manifest its revolutionary, liberating "black power" in the face of its all too well-known capacity to subjugate in a denial of such potential. As with the earlier Couleurs pliees it is impossible to opt in our reading of Verres for a definitively explanatory perspective, and yet, as Xavier Delcourt (cf. La Quinzaine Litteraire, 207 [1975], 11-12) has so rightly pointed out, Faye's writing, despite its unrelatable, untellable quality, is remarkable in the richness of its weave and texture. Certainly, in the midst of its illisibilite, Faye's text flashes intermittent half-messages about itself, its own functioning, and its relation to the concrete world "outside," thus allowing fragments of elliptic, untied, yet direct, immediate sense to protrude evocatively. Certainly Faye's poetry offers the bare traces of a self-history (of poet and text), whilst, simultaneously, its smooth surface prises off our grip, refuses the firm purchase we cannot but help anticipate. But Faye is not concerned to convey a simple, single, anodyne message. What he thrusts upon us is the swirling and swarming of language, its constantly shifting masses rather than a congealed structure- which is precisely what Robbe-Grillet found disconcerting in Faye's writing, much to the latter's pleasure (cf. Change, 24). Movement, change, becoming, these are the principles of Faye's articulation. The ceaseless, restless activity which is there in the world is thus reflected, diffracted rather, in the vigorous, tumbling, pulsional creativity of (his) language, which in turn echoes -both speaking of and demonstrating-the endlessly variable, transform- able-transforming "exchange of men, manifest or secret, and its weaves" (cf. Change, 24). This 793 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
