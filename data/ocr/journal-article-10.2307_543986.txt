<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GOD NHJ* ALAN R. SCHULMAN, Columbia University, New York THE round-topped stela illustra- ted in Plate I is one of the hundred- odd similar pieces which were recovered in the course of the 1915-1923 Pennsylvania excavations at the site of ancient Memphis. 1 Now in the collections of the University Museum in Philadelphia, where it bears the registration number E 13621, the stela is of a finely-grained white limestone, 10.3 x 7.3 centimeters in size, with a vignette shallowly incised on its face. When found it had been broken in half and was subsequently mended upon arrival at the Museum. The very crudely rendered scene shows the standing mummiform figure of the Memphite god Ptah facing to the right and holding a scepter whose head terminates in a combination of the hiero- glyphs Cnh, dd, and w8.2 Opposite the god is a very curious figure, the details of which are partially obscured by the crudity of the carving and partially as a result of the ancient fracture of the stone which has yielded a fortuitous line running vertically across the middle of the stela's surface. A careful examination of this figure (Fig. 1) reveals it to be a representa- tion of a square-headed bird with a short beak, a wattle at its throat, and a uraeus- * A shorter version of this paper was read before the 173rd General Meeting of the American Oriental Society, Washington, D. C., on 27 March 1963. At this time I should like to acknowledge with gratitude the kindness of the authorities of the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania in furnishing me with the photographs reproduced in Pls. I-III. I should also like to thank Professor Rudolf Anthes, who graciously read my manuscript for his pointed suggestions and comments. 1 Practically all of these stelas, including E 13621 (Find No. M-3103) were found buried beneath a later floor level in the environs of the palace of Meneptah. Together with those found by Petrie they will be subsequently published by the present writer. However, it may be noted here that almost all of the stelas found at Mit Rahineh by Fisher and by Petrie were intended as ex-voti, as objects denoting a simple declaration of pure faith on the part of the worshiper towards one or another of his personal gods. This view appears to be supported by the large number of fragments of various stelas found, each of which preserves intact the picture of a god. Moreover, for an ex-voto, nothing more was really necessary. However, for a different interpretation of the purpose of these stelas and fragments of stelas, see J. Yoyotte, Les Peldrinages (Paris, 1960), pp. 60--61 (= Sources Orientales, Vol. III). 2 Representations of the standing figure of Ptah on Memphite stelas usually picture the god standing inside a naos. There is a number, however, where the naos is not shown, e.g., British Museum 1472, Brussels E 4499, University College London 14396, Kestner Museum, Hannover, 1935.200.204, former Metropolitan Museum of Art 08.2052C (= W.

A more precise date is perhaps possible from the orthography of one of the words in the text of Coxe Expedition Find No. M-2766 discussed in note 20 below. 275</page><page sequence="2">276 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES serpent and sundisk on its head. Further, the bird is perched on a standard and appears to have a human arm which holds an Cnh. The break in the stone took place at the junction of the bird's legs and body, and the vertical bar of the standard upon which it rests is covered by a deeply ingrained incrustation of dirt. The uraeus, sundisk, and standard all indicate that a deity is here represented, and, although the physical characteristics of the bird immediately rule out an identification with either Horus, Thoth, Mut, or any of the other deities usually depicted in an avian guise, they do agree with description of the Sennar Guinea-fowl (Dik Sudani), the bird generally assumed to underlay the hieroglyph nh (Gardiner's Signlist G21),3 but a bird which, to my knowledge, is not used to designate any particular god. However, in the written sources from the Old Kingdom on, occasional mention is made of an obscure member of the Egyptian pantheon named Nhj (variant in the Ptolemaic period Nhh), and it is with this minor deity that I would identify the otherwise unknown god of the Philadelphia stela, assuming that the figure is simul- taneously a graphic and phonetic writing.4 If I am correct in this, then, crude as it is from an artistic standpoint, the stela is unique in that it bears the only picture of the nh-bird as a god, i.e., Nhj, known to date. Of further importance is the fact that the cognition of his physical form, or at least of a manifestation of it, may help us better to understand the nature of the god as attested in the written documents. Nhj first appears in the Pyramid Texts, Spell 301, an utterance concerned with the ascent of the dead king to heaven.5 In its opening lines several of the primeval gods of Hermopolis (Pyr. 446a-d) and Heliopolis (Pyr. 447a-b) are invoked as follows: (448a) jdd n jt.tn (448b) wnt rdn n-tn Wnj p'wt.tn 8htp tn Wnj m twt.tn (448c) jm.tn hsb Wnj dj.f hr.f jr 3h.t (449a) jw Wnj rh(w) 8w rh(w) rn.f Nhj rn.f Nhj nb rnpt rn.f (449b) m ch-c Hr h.rj gh.dw pt gcnh RC rc-nb (450a) jsd.f Wnj Scnh.f Wnj rc-nb Say to your father that Uni has given your bread-offering to you (and) that Uni has satisfied you with what is yours, (so that) 3A.

Keimer, "Sur l'identification de I'hieroglyphe NH ," ASAE, XXXVIII (1938), 253-64, and pp. 689-90. 4 Such an assumption is supported by a series of stelas found during the excavations of Selim Hassan at Giza and published by him in The Great Sphinx and Its Secrets. Historical Studies in the Light of Recent Excavations (Cairo, 1953) (= Excavations at Giza, 1936-1937, Vol. VIII), p. 236, Fig. 176, No. 50; p. 42, Fig. 3, No. 1; p. 43, Fig. 31, Nos. 4 and 9. Stela No. 50 shows a human ear and the god Horus in the guise of the falcon wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, and a dedication stating that the stela was "made by the necropolis-worker Nt-." No. 1 shows a pair of human ears flanking the divine name Horemakhet and below the dedica- tion "made by Huy." No. 9 shows a sphinx crouching over a pair of human ears and no text, and No. 4 shows an ear above a pair of falcons, each wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt. To this series may also be added an unpublished example from Memphis, now in the University Museum in Philadelphia, E-13641, showing the falcon manifestation of Horus, a single human ear, and no text. In each of the examples cited the graphic representation of the god and the ear or pair of ears is certainly also a simultaneously phonetic writing of the invocation *Hr Admw or *Hr msdr.wy gdmw, "Horus who hears," or "Horus, the pair of ears, who hears." For a further discussion and summary of the meaning of those stelas on which ears are depicted, see M. Sandman-Holmberg, The God Ptah (Lund, 1946), pp. 69-75. 5 See K.

"Nhj, lord of the year," is his name, he with the battle-ready arm, the Horus who is over the star-strewn part of the sky, who causes Re to live every day. He will restore Uni. He will cause Uni to live every day. Thus we see in this passage that certain Hermopolitan and Heliopolitan deities are instructed to tell their father, who, though not expressly mentioned by name, is indirectly equated with "Nhj, lord of the year," that the deceased king has paid them their rightful due. They are then enjoined not to obstruct his passage when he ascends to the horizon. The description of Nhj in Pyr. 449b as a manifestation of Horus, that is, as a god with the Gestalt of a bird, convinces me, when taken in conjunction with his picture on the later Philadelphia stela, that Nhj was in fact a sky deity in the form of a bird. Such an understanding of the physical nature of the god is further supported by references to him in both the Book of the Dead, Chapter 153b (PB), line 13:6 jnk Nh(j) jnk RC pr(w) mn Nwnw, "I am Nh(j)! I am Re who came forth out of Nun!" and in two Ptolemaic texts from Dendereh which mention pt hr.t Nhh, "the sky which bears Nhh,"7 and mri Nhh m pt, "seeing Nhh in the sky."' In a few htp-dj-n8wt formulas "Nhj, lord of years" (nb rnpwt) seems to be associated with Ptah. These shall be noted presently. Sethe's identification of N1hj as a form of Ptah rests upon two points: (a) that the father of the gods invoked at the beginning of Pyramid Texts Spell 301 could, accor- ding to the Memphite Theology, only have been Ptah,9 and (b) that Nhj's epithet in this spell, "lord of the year" (nb rnpt), is identical with the epithet of Ptah in the Memphite Theology, "lord of the years" (nb rnpwt), the more so since in those few htp-dj-ndwt formulas in which Ptah is associated with Nhj, the latter's epithet is also "lord of the years."10 Sethe then concluded that all references to either Nhj or to the "lord of the year(s)" should then be considered as paraphrases for Ptah,11 a conclusion followed by the Berlin Wdrterbuch, which interprets Nhj as "ein g6ttliches Wesen mit Ptah gleichgesetzt.''12 On the other hand, in her comprehensive study of the god Ptah, Dr. Sandman- Holmberg has very convincingly argued against Sethe's views as follows:13 (a) the attribute of being the father of the gods is not exclusively limited to Ptah; (b) none of those names or paraphrases which are used with NhIj in Spell 301 is usually found with Ptah, nor does it seem credible that he should be indicated thus in so round- about a manner in the Pyramid Texts where he is otherwise hardly mentioned; (c) nb rnpt, "lord of the year," N4j's 6 E.

Nhh nb rnpwt pw dt, "A ba is he, a ba of eternity is he. j'rt is he ... Nhh, lord of the years, is he forever,"14 which Sethe used to support his identification Nhj = Ptah, really contains no evidence that it is Ptah who is meant by the predicative pw, while several later texts already cited above clearly show that Nhj was, at least at that time, a sky god; (e) the occasional association of N4j nb rnpwt with either Ptah or Ptah-Tatenen in some Ramesside and later offering formulae15 does not warrant a permanent identification of the two, especially as these later texts date from a period when it was quite customary to synthesize Ptah with many deities, to assign their epithets and attributes to him, and vice versa.16 Perhaps one of the strongest arguments against the equation Nhj = Ptah is to be found in a sector of the art of the New Kingdom, for here in those few instances where a dual manifestation of a single god was to be shown on a stela, the physical form of the god was repeated, with an adscription containing the appropriate designation added to each figure. This may be illustrated by the following examples: (1) Stela find No. M-2766, from the Pennsylvania 1915-1923 Memphite ex- cavations, now in the Cairo Museum,17 of limestone, 36 x 23.5 centimeters (P1.

Facing him is an identical figure, now captioned as Pth nb (S)&gt;mn-m~t, "Ptah, lord of (S)men-maat.19 Between the two forms of the god is a table of offerings, and behind the second a male worshiper wearing a short kilt and skullcap stands with his hands raised in adoration to the pair. At the bottom of the stela a horizontal line of hieroglyphs names him as j4wtj n pr-Pth (Pth-)s&gt;nh, "a tenant-farmer of the Temple Estate of Ptah, Ptahseankh."20 Stylistically the stela appears to date to the very end of the Ramesside period or the very beginning of Dynasty 21.21 (2) Stela Cairo J.E. 45557, also from the Pennsylvania Memphite excavations (Find No. M-3107), of limestone, 14.5 x 18.8 14 Publ.

Sandman-Holmberg, op. cit., pp. 180-81. 17 At the time of writing I am unable to give the Journal d'entrde number. 18 Although written without the plural strokes, the adjective 1 shows that a concept of plurality was involved. The epithet "lord of his numerous ka's" is not known elsewhere for Ptah. Exactly what this epithet signifies may only be guessed at since there is no determinative written for k3(.w). On the one hand we may have a reference to Ptah being the recipient of a multitude of offerings (see WB., V, 92, Nos. 8-9), or, on the other hand, the epithet may be an association of Ptah with Memphis, as in the name of the city Ht-k:-Pth. As the epithet of the second manifestation of Ptah on our stela, "lord of (S)men- maat" is clearly geographic in nature (see note 19 below), it may very well be the case that "lord of Kau-ashauef," in parallelism, also refers geographically to a cult center of Ptah in the vicinity of Memphis. Such a place name, however, is not attested in H. Gauthier, Dictionnaire des noms geographiques (Cairo, 1928), V, 183 ff. 19 Written without the initial 9, but surely the cult-center of Smen-maat is meant. For the relations of Ptah with this locality, see M. Sandman-Holmberg, op. cit., pp. 219-20, and the literature cited there. 20 A name Scnh is not attested in H.

III). A man named BcIhj22 offers a lotus flower to two identical standing figures of the god Amon-Re, shown in his usual anthropomorphic guise, wearing the double-plumed crown. Behind him a goddess, probably Hathor from her horned sundisk headdress, stands with her left hand raised in the gesture of salutation. The foremost figure of the god is captioned Jmn-Rc nb pt, "Amon-Re, lord of the sky," and the second Jmn-Rc hik " W'i.t, "Amon- Re, ruler of Thebes." The elongation of the figures and also the dress of the worshiper point to a Ramesside date for the stela.23 When these examples are compared with the separate representations of Ptah as a mummy and Nh)j as a bird on the Philadelphia stela E 13621, it is then obvious that this stela shows two different gods, not a dual manifestation of a single deity. This, when taken in conjunction with the other evidence concerning his nature, very strongly supports if not confirms the view that, already in the Pyramid Texts, Nhj was not considered to be a form of Ptah but was rather a distinct divinity in his own right and, to be sure, a sky god.24 the late New Kingdom, the name is to be read Pth- 9cnh, but since Pth was already written in the title of the owner jhwtj n pr Pth, the second writing was then omitted. For such an avoidance of repetition in the writing of two similar hieroglyphs or even full words, see A. HI. Gardiner, op. cit., p. 422, par. 62A, and pp. 53-53, par. 62. For the name Pth-gcnh, see H. Ranke, op. cit., p. 301, No. 1, where he, however, has read the name as NSnh-Pth. For the title j wtj, "tenant-farmer," "cultivator," "field-hand," see A. H. Gardiner, "Ramesside Texts Relating to the Taxation and Transport of Corn," JEA, XXVII (1941), 21-22, and further, The Wilbour Papyrus (Brooklyn, 1948), II, Commentary, 82--83, and 87-88. For the temple estate of Ptah (pr-Pth), see ibid., p. 172 and H. Gauthier, op. cit., II, 79. 21 The spelling of jhwtj with the plant-sign (= Gardiner's signlist M 2), which is occasionally found as a faulty transcription from the hieratic of the hieroglyph for the fishnet C: (= Gardiner's signlist T 24), is occasionally attested: in the Eighteenth Dynasty it occurs in a text on a statue of the chief temple administrator Amenhotep from Memphis, Urkunden, IV, 1796 (= W. M. F. Petrie, Tarkhan I and Memphis V (London, 1913), P1. 80, 1. 19); in the Twentieth Dynasty it is found in the calendar Inscription at Medinet Habu, Medinet Habu, Vol. III, PI. 140, line 60. The short kilt worn by the worshiper on our stela, a type common in the Eighteenth Dynasty before the Amarna period, e.g., Stelas Cairo CG 34058, 34060, and 34078, appears again at the close of the Ramesside period and later, e.g., stelas Leiden CI (= Boeser, Beschreibung, Vol. VI, P1. 26) and AP 22 (= ibid., P1. 23). 22The name is found in neither Ranke nor Lieblein, op. cit. 23 E.g., stelas British Museum 154 (= E. A. W. Budge, A Guide to the Egyptian Galleries, Sculpture [London, 19091, P1. 24), 795 (= ibid., fig. on p. 184), 634 (= ibid., fig. on p. 197) and 792 (= ibid., P1. 25). The elongation of the figures, however, occurs later. Other stelas from the New Kingdom which portray the dual manifestation of a single deity known to me are (a) stela Hildesheim 1079, published by L. Habachi, "KhatAhna-QAntir: Importance," ASAE, LII (1954), 539-40, and G. Roeder, "Ramses II. als Gott," ZAS, LXI (1926), 61 and P1. 5, lower right, where the "royal butler, the justified Ramessemen," is shown worshiping two identical statues of "the lord of the Two Lands, Wosimare-Setepenre- Montemtowe" and "the lord of diadems, Ramesses- Micamun the god" (p3 ntr); (b) stela Ashmolean Museum Oxford, Report of the Visitors (1961), P1. III, pp. 20-21, where two identical cat deities are shown facing one another in the upper register. The one on the left is captioned "the great cat who rests in his beautiful name of Atum-in-peace (mjt c hitpj jm rn.f nfr n Jtm-m-h.tp), while the other is labeled "the beautiful cat - - - - - Re" (mjt nfr - - - - ). 24 R. Anthes, loc. cit., has demonstrated that Nhj, as the "Horus who is over the star-strewn part of the sky" in Pyr. 449b, is not just a sky god but is most certainly either the morning- and evening-star, or else the star Sirius. For the Ptolemaic conception of Nhh (i.e., Nhj) see A. Gutbub, "Hathor hnt qIwn.t, Re Hor h nt Bd.t, Amon hnt ' Wts.t," 1elanges Mariette (Cairo, 1961) (= "IFAO," Biblioth3que d'litude, Vol. XXXII), pp. 322-24.</page></plain_text>
