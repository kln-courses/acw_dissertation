<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Persian Stucco Frieze, and Other Fragments THE Museum has recently acquired a consider- able part of a carved stucco frieze' said to have been excavated at Sawa in Central Persia, not far from Qazvin. The figured decoration of the lower parts of wall surfaces by means of colored tiles or stone reliefs is characteristic of Achaemenid and Assyrian art; stucco was already employed in the same way in the Parthian and Sasanian periods. Stucco mural decoration appears notably in the palaces and private houses of Samarra in the ninth century.2 It is, however, under the Saljuqs of Turkestan, who overran Persia and Mesopotamia in the eleventh century and established a capital at Konia in Asia Minor, that Persian stucco was most fully developed; other examples of the Saljuq period have been found at Amida, Mosul, and Baghdad in Mesopotamia, and at Merv, Rayy (Rhages), and elsewhere in Persia. Stucco con- tinued to be employed under the Mongols in the thirteenth and fourteenth century and the technique has survived in Persia to the present day, some expert craftsmen being now activelv engaaed in 'Purchased with the Maria Antoinette Evans Fund; registered as 30.473; dimensions 1.78 x 1.165 m.

Islamic stucco sculp- ture appears also in Egypt (eleventh-fourteenth century), in Northern Africa, and in Spain where the most magnificent examples are those of the Alhambra in Granada. Figure subjects such as riders on horseback appear in Saljuq stuccos at Konia in the thirteenth century ;1 indeed, it is not unlikely that the Saljuq Sultdns, whose mothers in many cases had been Christian, had a good deal to do with the appear- ance of so many anthropomorphic representations in Persian art generally at this time. That the related figures characteristic of the polychrome pottery of Rayy are likewise directly or indirectly traceable to Christian sources or influences has already been suggested by Sir Thomas Arnold.2 However this may be, it is the case that numerous fragments of stucco friezes with figures in high relief, with faces of Mongolian type, and coiffure and costume similar to those of the contemporary lustred and polychrome ware, have been found in recent years, and in all probability many more remain to be discovered by excavation in other parts of Central Persia and Khurasan, and it is not surprising that simi- lar pieces should now have been found at Sawa. The Museum example here illustrated, both by its style and by the character of the decorated kuific script (the partially rounded forms of some of the letters suggest that perhaps the designation naskhi might be more correct), cannot be dated before the thirteenth, or more probably fourteenth century. So far, the inscription has not been deciphered. It does contain the name Tughril, but the Sultan in question can hardly have been one of the great Saljuqs, and must be regarded as some unknown Amir of the Mongol period. The relief consists of three main divisions: an inscription at the top, with a zone of elaborated arabesque and geometrical fretwork above the let- tering, and narrower borders of lozenge-shaped frets above and below; then the main section consisting of four figure groups framed in sunk panels against a design of free arabesque superimposed on fret- work, with other types of fretwork filling the remaining spaces; and below, the most archaic element, a frieze of running animals. The pair of facing riders to the right may have formed the centre of the original composition. The theme of the panel with two figures seems to be that of Joseph's flight from Potiphar's wife. The stucco, like that of Samarra, but unlike most examples from Rayy, does not seem to have been painted; still, it may be that all the coloring has merely been lost, for notwithstanding the fine state of preserva- tion, it cannot be said that the actual surface of the original is intact. In any case the decorative effect depends essentially on the contrast of light and shade; and one may almost assume that the original was intended to be seen in sunlight, perhaps in some garden court or hammam enclosure. If the impression made by the whole is slightly restless, this is mainly due to the layout of the curved framing lines of the sunk panels and comma- shaped motifs; on the other hand, the script, despite its decorated character, is still monumental, the figures are simply and boldly treated, and the diaper-like effect of the varied geometrical fretwork is very pleasant. So too is the ivory tone of the whole surface in its present condition. Another Persian stucco fragment' in the collec- tions consists of an upper border of affronted seated lions, and a broader area of geometrical diaper. This piece may be assumed to have come from Rayy and can be dated twelfth to thirteenth century. There is a piece of the lion border, evidently from the same source, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.2 Four smaller fragments in the Museum collection of uncertain origin but of about the same date are on a smaller scale and of more delicate workman- ship. Two represent affronted and addorsed birds, probably hawks, against an arabesque background in somewhat lower relief; the two others, portions of a narrow frieze of running lions, combined with a continuous floral arabesque, countersunk between plain narrow margins. Another Persian stucco fragment, not illustrated, is a hexagonal tile, with an arabesque ground, perforated in the centre to form a six-pointed opening; this must have formed part of a screen or window, rather than of a wall surface.
