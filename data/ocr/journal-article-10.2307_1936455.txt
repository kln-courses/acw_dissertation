<plain_text><page sequence="1">Late Spring 1976 REVIEWS 621 DESCRIPTIONS OF AVIAN BIOLOGY Ornithology is a taxonomic slice in E. P. Odum's biology layer cake. Ecology, physiology, molecular biology and the other layers have their unifying con- cepts. The slice fields lack such, but must transcend the specialized disciplinary layers and span their con- cepts. The biology curriculum needs a slice course that can integrate the life of an organism as a functional whole. Ornithology is an ideal slice, because birds' lives1 are so obvious; diurnality, conspicuous markings and be- havior, song, abundance, and esthetic appeal make them readily available to the undergraduate and the research scientist as well. The first edition has been a wonderful source of in- formation and stimulation for research, and the second edition is extensively revised and supplemented. The organization is easy to follow. The illustrations are fascinating and of excellent quality. The amount of information is amazing. Welty consulted 6000 additional references since the first edition. The bibliography of 44 pages contains about 1800 entries, pointing out an- other advantage of bird study, the fund of information contributed by amateurs and professionals from which we can draw for analysis. It takes a jack-of-all-trades to cut the layers of the cake along phylogenetic lines and attain a synthesis. There is so much to describe that it cannot all be di- gested; superficiality is inherent. Tabular data are in- teresting to see, but they would be enhanced with some arithmetic. Simple allometric equations or logarithmic graphs could convey more directly the body size de- pendence of physiological, anatomical, and ecological variables. A significant paper missing from the references (Tucker, V. A. 1968. J. Exp. Biol. 48:67-87) used allometry to show the impossibility of synchrony of respiration to wingbeat in small birds, a subject not clearly resolved in two attempts by Welty (pp. 123, 443). The life of birds is very physical, so the prerequisite for understanding flight, song, and energetics is clear. We require undergraduates in biology to take a year of physics and then assign a text with a deficiency in physics. The kilogram is not a unit of pressure (p. 92, fig. 6-3). Dark feathers (p. 49) do not necessarily increase heat uptake, as Marder (1973, Comp. Bioclienz. Physiol. 45A:431-440) showed by the similar skin temperatures of ravens and pale-plumaged partridges. Welty is in- consistent in units of energy, using kilowatt hours on p. 385 (in the S.I. system to which scientists are con- verting) and the older Kcal on p. 386. That the mag- nitudes of energy requirements are not thought through in these various units is obvious from the hummingbirds that can migrate on 0.69 cal per hour (p. 485)! This should have read 0.69 Kcal, if not 2.89 kjoules/hr, to get within an order of magnitude of hovering metabolic rates converted from p. 125. Air sacs cannot reduce the weight of birds (p. 3, 443) but they do increase the volume, and therefore the external surface area and drag. Drag, by the way, is not a function of weight (p. 441). Wing-loading is the ratio of weight to wing surface, not the reciprocal given on p. 443. Of particular interest to readers of Ecology are chap- ters on "The number of birds and their regulation," "The ecology of birds," and "The geography of birds." These also are descriptive surveys, not analytical. One wonders if the separation of these approaches would not be less if ecologists took Welty's characterization 'Welty, J. C. 1975. The life of birds (2nd ed.). W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia. 623 pp. $18.50. to heart: "Ecology is a young, rapidly growing science, and it contains some of the uncertainties, contradictions, and even adolescent jargon of youtlh." (p. 384, emphasis mine). The descriptive approach incorporates some circularity, anthropomorphism, and the implication that a conjecture has been established by actual measurement. The treat- ment of behavior includes terms such as "stupid" (p. 163), "nervous energy" (p. 169), "nervous tension" (p. 202), and "release of excess energy" (p. 258). Efficiency has a physically-exact meaning, the ratio of "what you get"/"what you pay for it," but here birds are liberally regarded as efficient: salt glands (p. 388), digestion and metabolism (p. 390), and wings (p. 445). Singing re- quires a "modest energy expenditure" (p. 201), an un- measured assumption, and "sounds carry far." The author acknowledges the likelihood of criticism for omissions, and certainly not every anecdotal descrip- tion in the literature can be included. Unfortunately, there are some notable omissions of fundamental im- portance. Two chapters totalling 29 pages are devoted to flight without drawing from the milestone contribu- tions of C. J. Pennycuick (Ibis 111:525-556, 1969) and V. A. Tucker (J. Exp. Biol. 58:689-709, 1973). The chapter covering excretion overlooks the beautiful work of Braun and Dantzler which explains how the unique bird kidney actually functions (A in. J. Physiol. 222:617- 629, 1972). A valuable new chapter, "Birds and Man," should be required reading for legislators who oppose federal funding for research on birds or measures to protect the environment. Appearing a half-year later is the second edition of another ornithology standard,' which has also grown considerably in size and price since its first edition. The revision is by the second author. The coverage isn't as broad as Welty's, but this book goes into more detail on anatomy and taxonomy. Since ecology is treated only with respect to distribution, I will make only a brief comparison here, and leave detailed review for orni- thology journals. The line drawings are excellent, but space is un- necessarily consumed by 156 photos of birds and nests, several of poor contrast or focus which may or may not be particularly useful to the adjacent discussion (e.g. sparrow portrait in chapter on "Voice and Sound Pro- duction," goldfinch nest in "Bird Distribution."). Per- haps portability for field trips and price would have been better if the space had been used more carefully. The last quarter of the book is devoted to an updated account of each family, one per page, featuring a species from the nominate genus. Like ecology, physiology gets proportionately less coverage than the four physiological chapters in Welty's book. A section, "Selected Physio- logical Topics," includes space-consuming tables from reviews, another case of the reluctance of ornithologists to review logarithms and opt for the economy of allo- metric equations. "Water and Salt Regulation" omits the Braun and Dantzler kidney studies skipped by Welty, as well as Johnson and Mugaas' renal anatomy work (Condor 72:288-292, 1970; Ain. J. Anat. 127:423-436, 1970). A chapter on "Flight and Flightlessness" offers a blurred shot of a grebe, but does not even discuss the principles of bird flight. 2 Van Tyne, J., and A. J. Berger. 1976.

With additional months for later literature coverage, there is no reference to the beautiful analysis of egg physiology and incubation of Rahn and co-workers (e.g. Condor 76:147-152, 153- 158). The bird navigation discussion includes terrestrial magnetism but leaves it at the 1950's, missing recent demonstrations of magnetic influence in crientation. According to Van Tyne and Berger, there are about 8600 species of birds in the world. Welty says about 8700. Is the object of ornithology to describe all of them, or describe enough so that the others can be predicted and understood? Why are they this way, and how do they function? To derive full benefit from ornithology, students must have more exposure to analysis. A wealth of raw material is found in these books, especially in Welty's Life of Birds. The teacher must provide the analytical thrust. W. A. CALDER III DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY University of Arizona Tucson, Arizona 85721</page></plain_text>
