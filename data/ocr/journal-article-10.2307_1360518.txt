Though still chiefly associated with famous auteurs such as John Heartfield and Aleksandr Rodchenko, photomontage is also widely viewed as the clearest instance of a compositional method that typified and even identified the 'left' avant-garde in the era of classical modernism - the era roughly from Dada to the reactionary regimes in Russia and Germany of the mid 1930s. For the art historian interested in the wider reaches of twentieth-century culture, this identification marks the beginning of a series of limitations, which begin to define an agenda for the study of montage today. For to ask how much, or how little, the pioneering principle of rupture can be recuperated in present- day cultural work is also to ask how far the montage of the earlier avant-garde depended for its effective- ness upon an 'official' optic of spatially coherent, continuous and legible imagery, propagated by the organs of the masculinist state for processes of normalisation and indoctrination - the suggestion is that montage lived within, but could not exceed, that historical framework. Against that historical anchoring, however, is a good deal of effective con- temporary art that uses montage for its technical flexibility and for its capacity to skirt around estab- lished genres in the male-dominated canon of mod- ernist and postmodernist approaches - I am thinking particularly of recent women's art in a variety of media. On the other hand it is clear that montage still appeals to many 'left' agitational-type artists precisely because of its resonances back to the principal (and principled) male auteurs of earlier decades. These connections and separations already imply that the topic of montage is a hot one, and that a sorting out of methods and affiliations is very much part of on-going culture. A second and very potent question arises out of THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 16:2 1993 the fact that the historical enclosure of the montage principle within the period roughly 1918 to 1935 is itself prone to certain conundrums and difficulties of generalisation. For there is more than a suspicion that montage was not confined to the great figures Heartfield, Rodchenko, Klutsis, Senkin and a few others - in whose hands it became a luminous and severely oppositional technique, but extended to become, or derived in part from, its widespread use by dozens of advertisers, page lay-out artists, designers and typographers, who deployed rupture as a compositional principle for all kinds of purposes connected with the marketing of goods and lifestyles in a 'modern' way. This last argument wants us to look again, effectively, at the pedestals upon which we install our Heartfields and Rodchenkos, and attend seriously to the pay-off between the high art of 'committed' montage and the low culture of con- sumerism, anonymous design, sweet-wrappers and travel brochures - contemporary visual culture in some more all-embracing sense. A third and more nearly historical agenda is simply to know more about the works of the com- mitted individuals and the printed ephemera, to fill out the historical picture for no better (but no worse) reason than that it is there. If I begin with David Evans' volume John Heart- field: AIZ/VI 1930-1938, it must be firstly to com- memorate the first gathering together of all Heartfield's montages published in the Arbeiter- Illustrierte Zeitung (renamed Volks Illustrierte) between 1930 and 1938, complete with translations of all the texts, identification of individuals and much of the necessary iconographical detail. This was, so it is generally argued, Heartfield's first and most effective sustained body of work, and the repro- duction of all 237 images between the same set of covers undoubtedly brings out just how complex and inventive these images were. It also allows us to look, perhaps for the first time, at the nature of Heartfield's method - whether or not it may amount to a 'style' - and the extraordinary political achievement that it constituted. The essay with which Evans prefaces the book provides a detailed survey of Heartfield the politi- cian, from his early days with Grosz in the German Dada movement to his first involvement with the German Communist Party in 1918, a transition he later described as one from 'protest against every- thing' to a 'systematic and systematically guided art propaganda in the service of the working-class move- ment'. Heartfield joined the Rote Gruppe in 1924 91</page><page sequence="2">and the Assoziation Revolutionarer Bildender Kiinstler Deutschlands (ARBKD) in 1928, did book- jackets for Malik Verlag, edited Der Kruppel (The Cudgel) with Grosz, and worked on Tucholsky's satirical book Deutschland, Deutschland uiber Alles before 1929 - before starting working with AIZ in 1930, by which time photomontage had earned its spurs as an artistic and political weapon. One of the further merits of Evans' text is that he goes beyond the merely political Heartfield into questions of artistic theory and method. As he makes clear, one of the material impulses behind AIZ's use of picture agency material was the termination of the Worker Photographers' Movement by the Nazis in 1933, the year when AIZ moved its offices from Berlin to Prague. Heartfield's output was also partially fuelled by the plethora of ready-formed 'official' imagery that flooded everyday reality after the beginning of the Prague period. What we do not yet know enough about, however, is the nature of Heartfield's involvement with satire in the Weimar period. Satire in general is an under-researched genre - compounded, in Heartfield's case, by an absence of terminology for the devices and tricks of the photomonteur. Here, Evans suggests four terms: metamorphosis, or the evolution of one image out of another; hybridisation, or the mixing of 'high' and 'low' in order to merge elements normally thought incompatible; anthropomorphism, the conversion of people into beasts and vice-versa; and contrasts of scale, in Rabelaisian style, to mirror and subvert rela- tions of power. Many, if not most of Heartfield's images, deploy all four. Above and beyond these techniques however it seems to me that a case can be made for saying that Heartfield's goal was frequently the exact opposite of the rupture principle: that more often than not he attempts to provide an intelligible mise-en-scene of things happening, of people speaking or acting, in a more or less legible and continuous narrative space. We do not normally think of Heartfield like this and yet the contrast with the Russians' use of abrupt spatial and formal incompatibilities, for example, many of them derived from Constructivism, must be immediately clear. Unlike the Constructivists, Heartfield generally conceals rather than reveals his production process, slides over and covers up transi- tions, air-brush joins and fissures and touches up all those marks and significations within the image that point to the fact that the thing has been made. The result, if this is so, is a pictorial principle that begins from the principle of rupture, but does not end with it. Based at the conceptualisation stage upon incom- patibles of scale, identity and origin, Heartfield's images still achieve their most vicious and cutting edge by arranging narrative scenes that are legible in a special sense: they approximate to the puppet- show, the pantomime or the book illustration in a striking and original way. It is arguable, then, that Heartfield's repertoire leans heavily upon carnivalesque inversions that sacrifice adult logic to childhood play - at the same time as addressing adult concerns in terms of thematic image and text. But the humour is never simple, and the puns and metaphors Heartfield used were often erudite. Classical aphorisms, popular sayings and learned quotations, were all inter- spersed amongst the multi-layered system of visual- verbal rhetoric. Evans' explications very successfully being out - assuming that these references would have been readily understood by the half million readers that AIZ attracted at the height of its popu- larity - how subtle and entertaining these texts actually were. In the ensuing discussion of the making of the Heartfield images Evans stresses that they 'had little in common with conventional notions of creativity and how artists work; the making of the photo- montages ... was a collaborative effort, akin to the making of a film ... or the production of an advert- isement' (p. 20). Suggestions from editors, Heart- field's reliance upon his brother Wieland Herzfelde for advice and dialogue, the re-touching and print- ing of photographs according to Heartfield's precise instructions, all fed into a process at whose centre Heartfield stood. But the very exactitude of the pro- cesses deployed; the exceedingly finejudgements on the tone, texture and continuity of the various images, all point once more to a pictorialist aesthetic at the centre of Heartfield's work. There are times when he joins photographic fragments precisely to convey the illusion of the documentary photograph, or to create the impression that the photograph has recorded not a constructed but a literal and visible truth. Here then is the paradox of montage in the form in which Heartfieldd developed it: photo- graphic fragments from disjunct sources are used not so much to fragment an existing pictorial order as to build a new one - a legible, coherent theatre of illicit jokes, imaginings and accusings. The anti-productivist and pictorialist side of Heartfield's output also emerged from the large his- torical exhibition marking the artist's centenary which opened at the Altes Museum in Berlin in the spring of 1991 and which tours the United Kingdom and America untilJanuary 1994. Conceived by Peter Pachnicke of the Akademie der Kiinste and Klaus Honnef of the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Bonn, the show and its catalogue, John Heartfield, repres- ented a further opportunity to reappraise both Heartfield as an artist-activist and the montage tech- nique as a device, across the entire scope of his career. Certainly it was a gratifying gesture to see the Altes Museum welcoming Heartfield back into the fold of German art after the cold shoulder he had received from the GDR on his return to that country in the 1950s. On another level I think there is some sadness attached to the spectacle of Heartfield's political illustrations being embalmed in glass cases in a string of prestigious museums from Berlin to Los Angeles, not least because the embalming pro- THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL - 16:2 1993 92</page><page sequence="3">cess inevitably tended to convert him from activist into a mere archive. For all its fascination, one could not but feel uneasy at the reconstruction of the 1920 Dada room (expertly done by Helen Adkins) as a museum piece. The unwanted (and unintended) effect of both Evans' book and the Berlin show is that, from now on, as never before, Heartfield will begin to function as 'Heartfield' - a historical relic for picking over by scholars and curators. It will prove a pity if this happens; but happen it almost inevitably will. It is almost too early to chart the ways in which this will be done. One way, of course, is to claim the activist for art. In the hands of Professors Pachnicke and Honnef, Heartfield certainly comes out of the exercise more of a traditional artist and less of an agitator, more a stylist who made subtle images than a powerful spokesperson for German communism. It is unfortunate, then, that the argument about pictorialism is not handled more satisfactorily. The prefatory statement from Pachnicke and Honnef that Heartfield's works, 'when released from the concrete historical situation, also prove to be varied and ambivalent artistic creations reflecting and penetrating the totality of a world full of contradic- tions', sound too much like part of the aestheticising process. It is vague and worrying enough. So is the attempt to divert the reader's and the viewer's atten- tion to the 'tonal values, the colours and structure of the material, the precisely calculated organization of the visual plane, the imaginary space devised by retouching', that allegedly 'extend beyond political current events [my emphasis], allowing the viewer to develop his thoughts, imagination and sensual per- ceptiveness' (p. 11). This is muddled; for the argu- ment, surely, is not about expunging politics from the discussion of Heartfield's work, but about join- ing his pictorial and aesthetic qualities to that discus- sion. It must be possible both to resist the aestheticisation of Heartfield's work as though he were merely an 'artist', and at the same time as to locate the pictorialist and to that extent aestheticis- ing tendency in his work within the framework of debates of his day. That project would be a welcome one. It is too seldom addressed in this crop of liter- ature on his work. How well, then, do Professors Pachnicke and Honnef manage to draw Heartfield into the field of contention around pictorialism, pictures, photo- graphy and art that was raging in the Soviet Union and in communist and workers' circles in Germany in the 1930s? The answer is: only partially. Pach- nicke challenges the view taken by Sergei Tretyakov that photomontage was a technically simple art which required 'no more than two elements ... a photo and a photo, a photo and a text, a photo and paint, a photo and a drawing',1 suggesting instead that photomontage is 'not merely a matter of scissors and paste; on the contrary ... the spatial treatment, the tonal value of the photograph, the re-touching technique and photogravure retain their import- ance' (p. 43). Finding both Romanticism and Sym- bolism in the luminous blacks and browns and delicate Chinese whites of Heartfield's work, Pach- nicke goes on to describe Heartfield as 'longing for inner harmony', of creating something near to, at least compatible with, Georg Lukacs' paradigm of an art that was more than a series of isolated frag- ments that could through its internal complexity 'reflect the world in its entirety'. Reminding us that as a general rule Lukacs disapproved of montage as a technique, Pachnicke claims that he nevertheless 'did not dispute the pictorial impact of Heartfield's photomontages' - and, if I interpret Pachnicke cor- rectly, implies that Lukacs never properly examined the montages, but would readily have appreciated their power if he had. It is not easy to know what to do with this argu- ment. Hubertus Gassner, in a fine essay on 'Heart- field's Moscow Apprenticeship 1931-32', reminds us that Lukacs first attacked montage in the context of remarks on the Malik Verlag writers who employed montage in the early 1930s, focussing upon the work of Ehrenburg, Shaginyan, Vsevelod Ivanov and Sholokov, as well as Upton Sinclair and Dos Passos; and only later, in the expressionism debate with Brecht, identified photomontage as a critical but not a constructive artistic genre: 'While montage, in its original form as photomontage, can make a striking and sometimes powerfully agita- tional impact, it actually draws its effectiveness from the unexpected combination of quite different, isolated bits of reality torn from their context. Fine photomontage has the effect of a good joke. But when this one-way connection - justified and effec- tive for the individual joke - claims the right to shape reality ... then the result is bound to be utter monotony.'2 The passage seems to me to be capable of being read two ways: as confirming Heartfield's status as a potentially effective critical artist, and as denying that purely oppositional aesthetics, dependent on fragments from a representational totality ordered by an overarching state, could ever make him more than a minor artist of his time. But the debate tran- scends the question of whether montage was or was not a 'valid' artistic procedure, reaching deeper into the network of claims being forged in Moscow at the time for an art that was constructive and optimistic, affirmatory and didactic - an art that could depict the world not as it was but as it ought in some future condition to be. The debate also falls foul of a distinction - one that Packniche clearly wants, but that Tretyakov did not perhaps sufficiently see - between Heartfield's particular project and photomontage in general. Heartfield's photographer Janos Reismann related in a 1934 article on Heartfield in Internationale Literatur that the shots he took for the montage were 'based on exact pencil sketches and always accord- ing to his personal instructions [and] often took hours, many hours. He [Heartfield] insisted on THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 16:2 1993 93</page><page sequence="4">nuances that I was no longer able to see.'3 It can virtually be deduced from this that Tretyakov's enthusiasm for montage was based only partly on Heartfield's own practice, but relied heavily upon the idea that photomontage was a mass art requiring little more than scissors, taste and wit: 'If the army of photomontage creators were counted', he said, speaking of the quick adoption of the technique by factory activists, Red Army groups, proletarian writers and designers, 'it would probably number tens of thousands'. Reismann contradicts this con- ception by emphasising the sheer difficulty of Heart- field's art. 'People don't have any idea how difficult it is to be a photomonteur', he quotes Heartfield him- self as saying. My point is that this does not yet license a full-scale mystification of the montage pro- cess as if it were 'ineffable' art. What is wanted at this point is some insight into the way in which Heartfield's pictorialist methods functioned at the time. One of the virtues of Hubertus Gassner's research is that it details the ways in which Heartfield's work contrasted with that of the Constructivist monteurs such as Klutsis and Elkin in the vital debates in Moscow in the summer and autumn of 1931. Heartfield went to Russia in April 1931 and gave talks and lectures in Baku, Batumi and Odessa where he was collecting material for an issue of USSR In Construction, sub- sequently published in December of that year. He exhibited alongside Klutsis with the Oktyabr group in June, but became suddenly embroiled in a dis- pute about the correct methods of poster production which had been fanned into life by the Central Com- mittee Resolution of February 1931. A key question was that of composition, but it quickly turned into one of pictorialism. Klutsis was heavily criticised for arbitrary and illegible design, putting forward 'incorrect' relationships between the proletariat and the factory and failing to show the component parts of the effort to build socialism as being 'organically connected'. Heartfield, by contrast, was lionised by publications such as Brigada khudozhnikov (Brigade of Artists) on account of his smooth transitions, exactness and unambiguity, and for correctly repres- enting the class enemy in its various guises. Klutsis and his friends (Pinkus, Senkin and Elkin among them) were forced publicly to admit their 'mistakes' and join RAPhK (the Russian Association of Pro- letarian Artists, affiliated to the proletarian writers organisation RAPP). Constructivist methodology was severely criticised as a 'left deviation', just as the easel painters of AKhRR wer castigated as a 'right deviation'. Heartfield, in moving close to RAPKh and also ROPF (Russian Association of Photo Journalists) in late 1931, continued for a time to be upheld by the anti-Constructivists. A question therefore arises whether Heartfield was aware of being used against the artistic left in Russia in the early 1930s, and if he was, what he might have done to support them - the sort of ques- tion that is virtually impossible to answer. What remains important is that Heartfield's political affili- ations throughout the thirties demonstrate that how- ever close he came in Russia to an affirmative art in support of industrialised socialism, his major con- tribution was made through his oppositional work outside Russia, in AIZ. For Gassner and for Evans in particular, who traces Heartfield's political affili- ations through into the GDR period at the end of his life, Heartfield emerges as a supremely political artist in a period in which politics in some form was a necessary ingredient of art. Nevertheless, the ques- tions which remain centre not upon what he achieved, but how. The writings discussed so far fall conveniently into a growing canon of advocacy for talented 'left' artists and writers who formed the mainstay of committed art practice in the middle part of this century. The fact that the overwhelming majority of them were men, and that their accomplishments are being ever more fulsomely charted by historians and critics of our day, is deeply lamented in a separate strain of criticism now gathering pace around the topic of montage. The exhibition Montage and Moder Life, organised by Matthew Teitelbaum at the Institute of Con- temporary Art in Boston and travelling to Van- couver and Brussels, proposed a broadening of the theme of montage to stand for far wider visual tropes and devices in the classic period of modernity. As is the rule nowadays, the catalogue to the show is also a book of the same title, and in Maud Lavin's section on the work of the Neue Werbegestalter or Circle of New Advertising Designers (NWG) who were active in Germany from 1928 to 1931, she bemoans the fact that attention to the (male) photomontage pioneers has marginalised advertising and design in what she calls 'leftist art history's tendency to look for pure and idealised heroes, like John Heartfield' (p. 41). Lavin - whose important work on Hanna Hoch has been emerging of late - finds in the work of the NWG a constellation of ideas around production, marketing and consumption which deploy the resources of montage to very different ends. As Lavin makes clear, the work is heterogeneous in its purposes; advertising, but also, for some, activism. Participants in the former, such as Jan Tschichold, Paul Schuitema and Piet Zwart were seemingly obsessed with a utopian future built on rationalised manufacturing and production techniques, and saw these techniques as capable of being used to re- structure the life-style of the urban proletariat along modernist and internationalist lines; as she puts it: 'photomontage in its various guises in high and mass culture was believed to represent a specifically mod- ernist practice of seeing and experiencing' (p. 40). Combined with scientific management, the elimina- tion of scarcity and class difference, the graphic work of the most prominent NWG members is identified by Lavin - surely convincingly - as an amalgam of romantic aspiration and complete blindness to issues of corporate power, commercial manipula- THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL - 16:2 1993 94</page><page sequence="5">tion, or capitalist profit. 'Communication' was their watchword; consumer utopia built on vigorous manufacture was their dream. As Lavin says, the NWG's relative neglect of women as consumers, and the allegorical poverty of their insistence upon motifs from industry and manufacturing, led them into a particularly masculinist approach, a 'rigid and anaesthetised version of the future ... offering a masculinist avant-garde for the masses' (p. 56). One of the joys and limitations of the exhibition catalogue-book genre is that it presents multiple viewpoints on its subject without feeling any need to atone for inconsistencies. The project of Montage and Moder Life as a whole was in many ways a strange one. There is a concise and detailed examination by Annette Michelson of the 'Theory of the Interval' in the film practices of Eisenstein and Vertov - the former coming out of it as a Symbolist against Vertov the mathematician and Constructivist - and there is an analysis by Margarita Tupitsyn of Gustav Klutsis' montage from the early 1920s through to the Five Year Plans; both, in effect, studies of modernist male auteurs about whom a lot more deserves to be written and said. But that is a very different project from moving away from the pioneer producers in the direction of unrecognised and sometimes anonym- ous designers who did much that was merely inter- esting or ordinary. Montage and Moder Life, then, pays attention both to the male auteurs and to the sweet-wrapper-and- ephemera end of things, and it is difficult whole- heartedly to endorse a project that seems to be pulling in contrary directions, apparently unawares. Let us look at the second part of that argument the argument that locates photomontage as a wide- spread cultural practice of modernity, perhaps the formal device of modernism in visual culture. Here, the organisers of Montage and Moder Life have some fairly grandiloquent and incompatible things to say. Matthew Teitelbaum characterises photomontage as an image that 'often conjures unreal space, and always incorporates a degree of narrative break- down' - by no means an uncomplicated thesis, if what I have argued is correct. He says that it 'invokes the discontinuous and the ruptured as the talisman of our century' - another sentence that is by now little more than a formula standing in need of radical dismantling. The exhibition as a whole allegedly 'argues that montage practice sought not merely to represent the real ... but to extend the idea of the real to something not yet seen ... montage offers a kaleidoscopic expanded vision ... that reflects a fast- paced, multifaceted reality seamlessly suited to a synthesis of twentieth-century documentary, desire and utopian idealism.' In montage, artists acknow- ledged the goal of'finding the means to represent the new moder metropolis developing at that time, and the goal of building a mass media culture designed for consumption by growing urban masses [to which] the search for a means to reflect and com- plicate our understanding of the realities of modern, urban lifestyle, and the search for a means to play with the fantasy and desire of a consumer age is fundamental' (p. 11). You see my point, perhaps: any of these phrases could be scattered amongst the work ofphotomonteurs and made to stick, somewhere. It is suddenly all vagueness and gesture. Christopher Phillips takes a different tack. He denies that the exhibition presents 'a comprehensive survey of the use of montage devices', but attaches it to a definite, but equally uncertain hypothesis: 'that for much of the first half of this century, montage served not only as an innov- ative artistic technique but functioned too as a kind of symbolic form, providing a shared visual idiom that more than any other expressed the tumultuous arrival of a fully urbanised, industrialised culture' (p. 22). Perhaps. But shared by whom? Symbolic for what audiences? Fully urbanised? Industrial cul- ture? When, exactly? And in whose hands? These are more than just surface irritations. The thoughts which lie beneath them are large and nebulous enough to form part of the wider tendency to postulate montage as the quintessential device of modernity - within which the canonical individuals are then re-situated as stimulants, or founding fathers. And the hypothesis can lead to surprising and sometimes distorting results. While Lavin calls for an examination of mass culture in Germany, and finds photomontage doing service for capitalist advertising, Sally Stein in her Montage and Moder Life essay examines American photography and advertising for evidence of montage and finds, to her chagrin, remarkably little of it. With a small number of exceptions, American practice tended, where it could, in the direction of wide, open shots with spacious margins and deep distance: an ethic of naturalistic illusion that purported to appear both unmanipulative and 'sincere', and that seemed to reach its logical concusion in documentary photo- graphy of the mid 1930s. But without the prior pre- sumption that montage pervaded modernity. Stein's result would attract little surprise. The United States did not, after all, suffer from a monolithic state power structure in the 1930s and nor did it have the European avant-garde. Put another way, the attempt to pin down a single meaning for montage is bound to come unstuck without examination of particular discursive con- texts at various historical moments and times. Rupture, for Brecht or Heartfield, was understand- able within a revolutionary tradition arising at some distance out of Dada; for Klutsis, out of and through Constructivism; for Barbara Kruger, against the male auratic surface, and so on. For all that it tempts us by its simplicity, the thesis also rides roughshod over vital differences within the montage technique itself. What Honnef calls 'the simultaneity of the unsimultaneous' is not invariably the effect. Nor is spatial discontinuity or heterogeneity, as the exam- ple of Heartfield shows. And the idea that montage has now 'reached the arts in general' and has THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 16:2 1993 95</page><page sequence="6">'become so established in human consciousness that we can confidently speak of an internalization' (Honnef again) comes dangerously close to asserting what Adorno, in one of his more pessimistic moments in Aesthetic Theory, could then deny. 'Now that the shock [of montage] has lost its punch' Adorno wrote, 'the products of montage revert to being indifferent stuff or substance... the interest in montage has therefore been neutralized'.4 The contrary deduction is that when montage of a given type becomes a norm, then new compositional ruptures and evasions have to be mobilised by the artist for given aesthetic and extra-aesthetic ends. And what goes for the compositional structure goes also for the joke. It really does seem the case that 'convulsion of the diaphragm usually provides better opportunities for thought than convulsion of the soul', as Benjamin famously said. For the sake of contemporary art and its historical origins alike, the function of the comic within the aesthetic and vice- versa ought to become a vital subject for debate. Notes 1. S.
