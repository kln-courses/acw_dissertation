<plain_text><page sequence="1">Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy. By Oliver Leaman. London: Routledge, 1999. Pp. xxx + 319. $60.00. Reviewed by Dan Wolne University of New Mexico For the professional philosopher not trained in non-Western traditions, quick and concise references to the issues and major figures in Eastern philosophy are difficult to come by. This is probably due, in part, to the difficulty of writing a book that covers the broad spectrum of Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Islamic accounts of philosophy. Oliver Leaman's Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy provides a quick reference guide for students of Eastern thought as well as those with no knowledge of Eastern philosophical traditions. Leaman understands that any short guide will in- volve hard choices about what to include, and he admits up front that not all issues and figures from Eastern philosophy are present in his work. The back cover indi- cates that the book includes concepts from Zoroastrianism, Sufism, Confucianism, Taoism, Hinduism, Islam, Shintoism, and Buddhism. The book is organized alphabetically, addressing key concepts, movements, and figures from these traditions. Leaman uses bold type to indicate terms that are cross- referenced in the text, and this style keeps each entry short, since any unexplained key term can be looked up elsewhere in the text. In most cases, the key figures in a tradition or concept are indicated, so the reader gains a quick summary of the issue. In almost all of the entries, no dates for movements or major figures are given, which makes it a bit tough for the reader unfamiliar with Eastern philosophy to discern whether an ancient or contemporary figure or movement is being outlined. Since it is clear from the relative number of entries that the book is most concerned with the Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, and Chinese philosophical traditions, a breakdown along these lines provides a clear format for review. With regard to Buddhism, the book does an admirable job explaining some of the most notoriously difficult aspects of the tradition. There are clear and concise accounts of the Abhidharma school, the figure of the bodhisattva, and the issue of causation in Buddhist thought. In particular, the book's exposition of Nagarjuna and Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 52, Number 3 July 2001 389-391 389 ? 2001 by University of Hawai'i Press</page><page sequence="2">the Madhyamaka school is very lucid, and Nagarjuna's account of emptiness (and the necessity for the student to "empty" the idea of emptiness) is explained in a manner accessible to even a novice student of Buddhist philosophy. Yet although the book does a fine job with some of the intricacies of Buddhist thought, it offers problematic summaries of some other basic ideas of the tradition. For example, consciousness is not identified as one the five skandhas in the entry on conscious- ness. The entry on Nirvana defines this key concept primarily as an emotional state (the "highest possible level of happiness"), without indicating anywhere that it serves as the goal of the tradition (in part) because the individual who has achieved Nirvana is not reborn into the cycle of birth-death-rebirth. And in the entries involving Zen, the only classical figure cited in any detail is DOgen, and Dogen's account is often presented in a confusing and contradictory fashion. For example, in the entry on Japanese philosophy, Leaman asserts (incorrectly) that DOgen believes that enlightenment comes about through a gradual process that is facilitated by zazen (sitting meditation). Yet in the entry on Zen, he correctly outlines Ddgen's nondualist perspective, where everything already is Buddha-Nature; thus the dual- ism of means/ends is mistaken, as is the belief that practice of any sort will help us "acquire" enlightenment. Finally, all of the references to Nichiren, the medieval Japanese Buddhist, focus only on his views regarding the acceptability of violence toward other types of Buddhism, and they neglect to mention any other salient aspects of his thought. Although it is startling to see that a Buddhist could advocate violence toward those who do not share his view of Buddhism (the reasons are briefly outlined), it does not do Nichiren's thought justice to focus only on this aspect of his philosophy. The vastness of the Hindu tradition can pose a problem for anyone trying to construct short summaries, but as an introduction to most of the main theories and figures in Hinduism, the book does an adequate job. Accounts of the Nyaya- Vaisheshka tradition, the disagreements between Shankara and Rdmdnuja over the nature of Ultimate Reality, and the basics of Samkhya philosophy are all very lucid and succinct, especially given the complex nature of these issues. Still, as with the entries on Buddhism, there are some problems with a few of the basic concepts. The entry on caste does not identify caste as a Hindu notion. There are difficulties with the concept of Atman that occur across many entries; the book is not always clear about the distinction between the conditional self and the eternal self in Hindu thought, and in many places the generic term "self" is used. The Bhagavad GTta is identified as an "Upanishad," which, strictly speaking, is not the case, since the Upanishads are part of the corpus of the Vedas, considered "shruti" or revelation, while the GTtj is usually classified as being "smiriti," that which is remembered. Some of the discussions of Hindu concepts involve references to God, which is usually not put in a Hindu context, and since the text asserts that it presupposes no previous knowledge of Eastern philosophy, using this complicated term in a cavalier fashion is misleading. Surprisingly, in the entry on time, nothing is said about the Hindu cyclical view of time, although the notion of time in other traditions is 390 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="3">covered in detail. Yet, aside from these few confusions, the sections involving the Hindu tradition are well-constructed and useful as quick references. The discussions of Islamic philosophy are some of the best parts of the book, and the author demonstrates a keen understanding of the works of ibn Rushd, ibn SiTn, al- Ghazzali, and al-Suhrawardi. References to Islamic concepts make clear connections to Greek philosophical sources-a helpful touchstone for those grounded in the Western tradition. The entry on Islamic fundamentalism lays out the basic assump- tions of this ideology very clearly, briefly outlining the relationship between funda- mentalism and science, and how Islamic views of the natural world find their expres- sion in fundamentalist social philosophy. The only complaint that I have with the entries involving Islamic philosophy is that Sufism is not treated in any adequate detail. There is only one tantalizing sentence on Sufi views of enlightenment, and although there is a cross-reference to meditation in the entry on Sufism, no information is pro- vided about Sufi meditative or ascetic practices. Given that the book's cover touts its inclusion of Sufi concepts, more should have been done to make the entries involving the Sufi tradition as comprehensive as the other entries on Islamic philosophy. Finally, in the entries involving Chinese philosophy, the same pattern occurs that crops up in the Buddhist and Hindu entries. There are many good summaries of Chinese concepts and movements, but a few basic ideas are confused or given in- adequate treatment. The explanation of the Yijing is very well done, and it includes summaries of both Daoist and Confucian interpretations of this ancient text. The summaries of the Mohist and Legalist schools are crafted well, and the entry on Neo- Confucianism is very detailed and accurate, including all of the major figures and issues. Yet the subsequent entry, on Neo-Daoism, is much less detailed, and does not include any of the major figures in the movement. And given the detail and general accuracy of the Confucian and Neo-Confucian entries, it is surprising to find only a two-sentence entry on ren, a key Confucian concept. Also, the summary about Xunzi's views on human nature is incorrect, since Xunzi's writings clearly state his position that the nature of man is innately envious and hateful. And once again, in the entries involving the Chinese term tian, no appropriate context is given; the term is simply translated as "heaven," with no indication that the term can (variously) mean "sky," an anthropomorphic ruler, "fate," or "nature." These sorts of difficulties make it frustrating for the reader with some knowledge of the traditions under explanation, since the entries that are accurate can be very helpful in sum- marizing a movement or issue, but the problematic entries can make the careful reader suspicious of the overall accuracy of the text. The other traditions listed on the cover, Zoroastrianism and Shintoism, are not covered in any detail, and the publisher and/or author should not have asserted that they are included in the same fashion as the other major traditions. There are only a few, very basic references to Zoroastrianism, and even fewer for the Shinto tradition. Yet, aside from the lack of dates and some problems with a few of the key concepts, the book succeeds in its stated purpose to provide a quick reference guide to issues and figures in a variety of non-Western philosophical traditions.
