<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 6  Aesthetics and History:  L'Education sentimentale  I'm having a lot of trouble linking my characters to the political events of  1848; I'm afraid the background will devour the foreground.  -Gustave Flaubert to Jules Duplan  The foregoing chapters have emphasized that aesthetics is a theory  and an ideology of history, but so far the question of history has not  achieved centrality. We have seen that the notion of the Bildungsroman is  inherently historical insofar as it claims to represent or enact aesthetic ped­ agogy, since the temporal arc of the individual subject's Bildung always at  least potentially exemplifies that of humanity. We have also seen, however,  that the literary texts designated by the notion of the Bildungsroman destroy  the aesthetic narratives they provide. They do not simply cast doubt on the  rationale or the outcome of an aesthetic education; rather, they generate  within the narrative of aesthetics allegories of its incoherent and uncontrol­ lable production. The disruptive figural narratives we have encountered in  variously innocent or sinister locales-a child's identification with mar­ ionettes in the Lehrjahre, a medical student's dissection of marionettes in the  Wanderjahre, Madame Laure's murderous blow in Middlemarch-suggest  that a "historicity" irreducible to representation inhabits aesthetic histor­ icism, precisely because the latter ultimately has no choice but to seek to  ground itself on the potential arbitrariness-the "literariness" -of lan­ guage. 1 It is now time to pursue that suggestion further by way of a text  more consistently focused on the matter of revolutionary history.  Flaubert's L'Education sentimentale is useful territory on which to plot a  conclusion to this study, since in addition to raising the question of the  historical event, the text mercilessly exacerbates the negative spiral that  seems to be the only condition of possibility of a Bildungsroman. Already in  the Lehrjahre, as we saw, Bildung is recuperable, if at all, only as its own  1.

The Bildungsroman may  or may not exist, but one can at least be sure that Flaubert's novel will  participate in this generic conundrum only as "an Unbildungsroman of ge­ nius."2 Such negative certainty has its own seductions, of course. Since  Flaubert's irony is neither sympathetic nor olympian in tenor, the aesthetic  promise of his texts is all the more extreme, for the rigor of such obviously  undeluded irony purges aesthetics of any lingering traces of idealist na­ ivete. When one adds to this rigor the pathos of a life dedicated to it, the  result is a potent brew. It is no accident that over the course of the last  century Flaubert has become a more genuinely international figure than  Eliot or Goethe. "Flaubert seems very much at the source of a conception of  the artist which is still with us," Jonathan Culler comments;3 and the histor­ ical success of this conception derives from its ability to link a valorization  of the artwork's formal purity to a prurient obsession with the artist, or at  the very least with the artist's self-sacrifice. The painful, sweaty, useless  labor of writing; the blend of idealism, self-glamorization, and corrosive  nihilism with which this labor is performed; the self-consumptive tech­ nologization of aesthetic composition such that writing becomes an endless  askesis of rewriting, paring and deleting, asymptotically headed toward a  "livre sur rien," or, in another famous formulation, toward a Book that  "inasmuch as one separates oneself from it as author, does not require any  approach by the reader"4-in short, the artist and the oeuvre of modernis�  find their image in Flaubert, the "true Penelope" of more than one  twentieth-century literary destiny or desire. Flaubert's name has come to  signify the production and ratification of literature itself.  As a result, Flaubert-particularly the Flaubert of Madame Bovary-has  become the object of fascinated scrutiny in a way few other cultural icons  have. There is probably no real equivalent to Sartre's massive L'Idiot de la  Jamille elsewhere in mainstream literary-critical discourse, nor is it easy to  think of a novel that has inspired more whimsical metafiction than Madame  Bovary. The lure of impersonality partly lies in our urge to violate it: to  2.

An older school of criticism emphasized  more positive links between Flaubert and the putative father of the Bildungsroman.

In all cases these narratives are charac­ terized by a double figure of preservation and destruction: a name and a  story link themselves to a vision of literature's emergence through its own  self-obliteration. Flaubert's excision of "any novelistic element," Zola tells  us, produces realism; his self-reflexive practice of citation, Michel Foucault  claims, produces modernism-"Joyce, Roussel, Kafka, Pound, Borges. The  library is on fire."6 Thus, at one point in the writings of the most prominent  Sartrean in Anglo-American criticism, Fredric Jameson, Flaubert becomes  "the privileged locus" of a modernity "which the term reification in its  strictest sense designates" : " [T]he depersonalization of the text, the laun­ dering of authorial intention, but also the disappearance from the horizon  of its readership, which will J.:&gt;ecome the public introuvable of modernism,  are all so many features on which the process of reification feeds, using  Flaubert's aesthetic vocation as its vehicle and mode of realization."7 Inher­ ited from Lukacs and Sartre, Jameson's model projects onto a historical axis  the onto-theological patterns of the biographical and referential approach.  At the origin, a closed communicative circuit returns meaning to a subject,  while the fall into literature becomes an illegitimate descent into matter via  the trope of "reification." Jameson's particular emphases in this passage are  by no means determinative-at other points his dialectical model will val­ orize modernism differently-but Flaubert's appearance at this point in  The Political Unconscious is not accidental and testifies to the ambivalence  with which critics tend to express their fascination with the idea and prac­ tice of literature.  5.  See Woody Allen's witty "The Kugelmass Episode," in Side Effects (New York: Random  House, 1980), and Raymond Jean's less amusing Mademoiselle Bovary (Avignon: Actes Sud,  1991): both texts mobilize the conceit that Flaubert's novel is a world that can be entered, lived  in, changed, and so on.

If his­ tory is the world's fall into capitalist reification, and if literature is a  product and a mirror of that catastrophe, then the critic's recovery of a  subject for the literary text-even the most negative, bored, self-hating  subject-would function as a token of history's essential humanity. One  may call such a hope "idealist," but it animates in covert fashion much  of what counts as literary criticism, and it is not easy to avoid. L'Educa­ tion sentimentale offers us the aesthetic in its most icily negative mode­ as the humanization, universalization, and, thus, the historical recupera­ tion of the petty destiny of Frederic Moreau via the askesis of pure form.  Yet as Culler remarks, a "curious indeterminacy" has also been felt to  be exerting pressure on the seemingly clear theme of "a Bildungsroman gone  sour" (Flaubert, 135-36). In what follows I hope to show that this novel  allows us to read the irreducibility of history to narrative, even the narra­ tive of a catastrophe. Not for nothing is Frederic's story that of 1848,  the revolution redux-the farcical reiteration of tragedy, as Marx famously  put it, when "only the ghost [Gespenst] of the old revolution walked  about."9 Though L'Education sentimentale does narrate and scrutinize the  story of reification that Jameson tells, the text also suggests the perti­ nence of Marx's spectral trope by exploring the possibility that uncanny,  non-organic and non-aesthetic patterns of repetition compose the events  we call historical.  I  The peculiar difficulties Flaubert's texts pose to interpretation are  well known. Although the forms and conventions of nineteenth-century  narrative remain in place, particularly in the "realist" novels Madame Bovary  and L'Education sentimentale, the meaning of these forms is program­ matically compromised, and at times radically shaken. The characters in  L'Education sentimentale are coherent entities, and Frederic is a psychologi­ cally nuanced one, but once we begin to read the text with care, the point of  8.

Not only is Frederic's a  boring and mediocre consciousness, but the novel's interest in portraying  this consciousness is somewhat sporadic, as though the text itself felt as a  burden the monotony of its own unfolding. The things that happen to  Frederic fall short of significance, despite the perfectly conventional­ which is to say, reasonably Balzacian-assembly of coincidences moving  him through a relatively circumscribed field of characters and events. IO  On  the face of it-though of course this is the question with which we are here  proposing to dwell-neither his "sentimental education" nor his encounter  with history in 1848 appears to add up to much. The former interferes with  his experience of the latter but, as we shall see, fails to provide any secure  locus of value. Meanwhile, though Frederic himself at various points feels  he has missed out on history because of his overinvestment in a bourgeois  romance plot, the text suggests the inadequacy and bad faith of this reading  as well, since his participation in the assault on the Tuileries leaves him with  no dear psychological or symbolic profit. Neither the public world of revo­ lution nor the private world of love offers any immediate justification for  novelistic representation.  Furthermore, no uncompromised symbolic meaning takes up the slack.  In this respect the problem of historical representation is exemplary: the  main articulations of Frederic's private life echo those of the historical  narrative, but never quite allow the hero's education, or the failure of his  education, to acquire the full dignity of a symbol. 1 1  On the eve of the  February uprisings, Frederic fails to seduce Mme Arnoux but succeeds in  getting her profane double, Rosanette, to take her place in his bed; on the  eve of Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat, witnessing the "vente de Mme Ar­ noux," Frederic sees his ideal woman metaphorically dissolve into com­ modity exchange: these parallels-a second-best beginning; a sordid end- 10. The ways in which Flaubert mimes and undercuts the Balzacian novel have frequently  been studied; for a recent analysis, see Peter Brooks, "Retrospective Lust, or Flaubert's Perver­ sities," in Reading for the Plot: Design and Intention in Narrative (New York: Vintage, 1985), 171- 215.  11. The parallels are elaborate and carefully plotted: see Maria Amalia Cajuero-Roggero,  "Diner chez !es Dambreuses: 'La reaction commen�ante' ," in Histoire et Iang age dans 'L'Education  sentimentale' de Flaubert (Paris: Societe d'edition d'enseignement superieur, 1981), 63-76, and  Anne Herschberg-Pierrot, "Le travail des stereotypes dans !es brouillons de la 'prise des  Tuileries'," 43-61, in the same collection. As Cajuero-Roggero shows, manuscript versions of  L'Education sentimentale make clear that the dinner at the Dambreuses takes place on 2 July;  which is when the forces of reaction gained visibility when Cavaignac reviewed his troops at  the Concorde; similarly; Dussardier is killed on the day when, according to Flaubert's notes,  popular resistance was definitively crushed. Flaubert suppressed or camouflaged his array of  significant dates in the final version of the manuscript. Herschberg-Pierrot's study recovers  several intriguing examples: the "prise des Tuileries" is carefully dated 24 February in an early  manuscript; and Frederic and Rosanette leave for Fontainebleau on the 20th of June.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 176 Phantom Formations  offer the teasing possibility of a symbolic structure, but one is also left with  a sense that the interpretation has succeeded only at the cost of missing the  point. Textual elements that ought to be symbolic raise problems that nag at  the reading mind: Rosanette' s diseased and short-lived baby, for instance,  should be an embodiment of historical decay, but the dates of its conception  and birth do not quite match any date of political significance, and one is  left either with a handful of loose ends or with the weaker and more  gratuitous claim that the infant embodies belatedness, sterility, insignifi­ cance, and so on. The transformation of Arnoux' s periodical and art gallery  L' Art industriel into an earthenware factory and, finally, a trade in religious  artefacts suggests, like the "vente" of Mme Arnoux, a certain degradation,  an increasing triumph of the commodity; so does Fredenc's acquisition of a  second mistress, the moneyed Mme Dambreuse, at the beginning of part 3;  but the categories needed to organize these events into a meaningful pat­ tern are sufficiently large and vague as to seem slightly otiose. Things get  even worse if we abandon the historical dimension and begin portioning  out the binary oppositions of literary and theological tradition. Mme Ar­ noux and Rosanette may be linked and opposed as the ideal and the actual,  spirit and flesh, sacred and profane, and so on; with the arrival of Mme  Dambreuse the lure of the profane becomes that of avaritia as well as vo­ luptas; these and other allegories spin easily out of Frederic's story, and in  their overscripted facility announce themselves as received ideas, the her­ meneutic equivalent of Arnoux's commodified icons. Anything can and  must be interpreted in this textual world, but the resultant meanings come  accompanied by a faint or glaring aura of betise.  Yet even that generalization is insufficiently guarded, for at times  Flaubert's text will achieve a density such that one cannot be sure whether  one is trapped within an ironic structure or not. In the great final scene  between Frederic and Mme Arnoux, for instance, the text blends ironic  distance with dramatic intensity such tJ:iat the status of phrases such as  Mme Arnoux's famous future anterior "nous nous serons bien aimes" be­ comes impossible to decide. 12 The scene is genuinely moving, and draws  on the memory of other moments of intensity in the history of Frederic and  Mme Arnoux's star-crossed love; yet the future anterior assertion-we will  have loved: in a time not yet present, our love will be past; our love is  fiction, the affirmation of an imagined memory-manages to be at once  12.

The fragile and radical fic­ tionality of love occurs as a citation that, in marking its fictional status, falls  short of itself, while retaining its pathos:  "Sometimes your words come back to me like a distant echo, like the  sound of a bell carried by the wind; and I feel you are there, when I read  about love in books."  "Everything one criticizes as exaggerated in books, you have made me  feel," said Frederic. "I can understand Werther not being put off by  Charlotte's bread and butter." (393-44 / 413)  Even the slightly comic reference to Werther, of all texts, does not strip the  passage of its force; yet at the same time, if Frederic and Mme Arnoux can  express themselves only through literary language, the ethical and libidinal  correlatives to this predicament create an uncertain hovering between au­ thenticity and bad faith. Shocked by her age, Frederic pours out his love "to  conceal from her his disappointment," and falls into his own illusion: "She  rapturously accepted this adoration of the woman she no longer was. Fre­ deric, drunk on his own words, began to believe what he was saying"  (394 / 414). The scene builds toward an elegant and merciless paragraph:  Frederic suspected Madame Arnoux of having come to offer herself;  and he was seized by a desire [ convoitise] stronger than ever, frenzied,  rabid. Yet he also felt something else, an indefinable feeling, a repulsion,  like the dread of incest. Another fear stopped him, that of being disgusted  later. Besides, what a nuisance it would be! And partly out of prudence  and partly to avoid degrading his ideal, he turned on his heel and started  rolling a cigarette. (395 / 415)  The slippage of love's literary language into the blend of passion and  calculation of a "convoitise"; the careful splicing of motive such that Fre­ deric's archaic fear of incest becomes no more and no less compelling than  his worry about an awkward entanglement; the coolly incisive summation  of his turn away from Mme Arnoux, "tout a la fois par prudence et pour ne  pas degrader son ideal" -all this psychological fretwork shows Flaubert a  master of literary realism and as such presents no difficulty; however, over  the course of this scene the trope of "love" becomes illegibly poised be­ tween irony and affirmation. Read figuratively, as its own ironic negation,  love provides a certain bleak knowledge: the sentimental education will at  least have been able to confirm the essential falseness of love. Read literally,  as an affirmation of itself, love offers us the delicate integrity of fiction  ("nous nous serons bien aimes" ) but makes the sentimental education irrel­ evant, since the pure fictionality of this love's temporal structure has noth- </page> <page sequence="8"> 178 Phantom Formations  ing to do with the accretive temporality of experience, being spun out of a  grammatical subject's ability to be at once future and past.13 Both of these  alternatives have their seductions and drawbacks, but both exist only inso­ far as they destroy each other's possibility. It is impossible to say whether  love should be read literally or as a self-consuming figure, and it is also  impossible for the characters to remain suspended between these two alter­ natives, or securely ensconced in one of them. They know their fictionality  yet they believe their own words, and in both cases they are at once justified  and deluded.  At moments like these the text pushes to the limit our ability to read its  irony. On the one hand, the novel has served us an illegible figure; on the  other hand, in saying this we are also always saying that the text has  intended to be illegible, and in Flaubert's case, of course, we can promptly  beef up textual with authorial intent. His famous poetics of citationality has  succeeded: doxa has been parroted with such elegant cunning that the  reader cannot tell whether the performance is a parody or not.14 Even as we  state our uncertainty, we obliterate it by recanonizing text and author.  When Roland Barthes, for instance, tells us that in Flaubert's case "one  never knows if he is responsible for what he writes (if there is a subject  behind his language)," he is also inevitably telling us that Flaubert has  accomplished this uncertainty, and, indeed, should be given credit for hav­ ing done so.15 But the linguistic structures making possible le Gar�on's last  and most subtle joke are indeed not necessarily under subjective control,  for precisely the reasons Flaubert suggests in staging Frederic and Mme  Arnoux's last encounter. If we unmask fiction as merely fictional we  thereby tumble into believing it; yet as soon as we start believing in it-by  crediting Flaubert or Flaubert's text, for instance, with the knowledge of its  own unknowability-we are as deluded as Frederic, swept away by his  own rhetoric of love. For whatever the historical Flaubert may have in­ tended or known, the authoritative Flaubert one constructs while reading  L'Education sentimentale is an irreducibly literary fantasy, projected onto a  13.

Culler 's emphasis falls on the "fragile romantic triumph" this scene  provides, as well as on the fact that the detached fictionality of this romantic triumph "makes  nonsense" out of "the explicit contrasts in terms of which the rest of the book appears to be  constructed" (155).  14.

The result, as we have seen, is a highly successful, because  profoundly ambivalent, canonization of Flaubert. We read an overabun­ dance of meaning into his work in order to evade the difficulty of reading  it-a difficulty that manifests itself in the preprofessional era of Flaubert  studies as a condemnation of the textual nihilism one now so easily recupe­ rates. "L'Education," Thibaudet commented in the 1930s, "was immediately  and is still today criticized for taking part itself, as a work of art, in this  wastage, this emptiness, this bankruptcy."16 One often speaks a little too  easily of Flaubert's valorization of form. The "continual, monotonal, sad,  indefinite procession" of his prose, as Proust famously described it, marks a  habit of writing irreducible even to the negative aesthetics it propagates.17  It is no accident that in the closing pages of L'Education the figure of  "love" should organize the text's resistance to understanding. Love not  only stages the question of Bildung in this text, but the double-edged lure of  literature itself. Nothing is more stereotyped than love, yet love alone has  the power to forget its own banality. Love is the force of fiction, a force that,  for all its power to shape lives and events, may only exist because we read  about it in novels: this is the idee re9ue providing what Michael Riffaterre  would call the matrix or hypogram for the erotic destinies of Emma in  Madame Bovary and Frederic in L'Education sentimentale. 1s We may note in  passing that one consequence of this literary problematic is the peculiarly  atavistic forms that desire so frequently assumes in Flaubert-the odd  slippage between realism and allegory, for instance, that causes Emma  Bovary to be "burnt more fiercely by that intimate flame which her adultery  kept feeding, panting and overcome with desire," as though the ancient  figure of adultery, not the consciousness of a young bourgeoise, were  desire's true subject. 19 The slightly archaic ring of Frederic's "convoitise"  16.

One of Flaubert's more remarkable descriptions of desire was excised from  the final version of Madame Bovary: when Charles, after Emma's death, meets Rodolphe and  pronounces his grand mot ("It was the fault of fate"), Rodolphe, who had had ahand in this fate,  finds the remark "comic and slightly despicable": "For he understood nothing of that voracious  love which hurls itself at random on things to slake itself, of that passion empty of pride,  without human respect or consciousness, which plunges entirely into the loved object, seizes its  sentiments, palpitates with them, and nearly attains the proportions of a pure idea, through its  size and impersonality."

Love is literary to the extent that its power is undecidably  that of myth or of cliche.  But the aporia of love does not exhaust the literary problematic staged by  L'Education sentimentale; we have yet to approach the text's central crux,  which is the relation between "love" and "history." The path I propose to  follow at this point has been marked out by Flaubert's reception. Particu­ larly in the wake of Sartre's L'Idiot de la famille, critics have frequently  construed Flaubert's texts in terms of linguistic, libidinal, or socio­ ideological fetishism.20 To such construals the texts respond with such  alacrity that a closer look at the notion of the fetish holds considerable  promise. Our brief examination of the scene between Frederic and Mme  Arnoux has already made it obvious that in L'Education the conundrum of  love is male; and besides marking the institution of sexual difference, the  notion of fetishism will eventually help us sketch a relation between the  aporetic figure of love and the revolutionary event it appears to foreclose.  I I   What is a fetish? A dazzling apparition, self-originary and unique; a  secret embodiment of sight itself:  It was like a vision [Ce fut comme une apparition] :  She was sitting in the middle of the bench, all alone; or at least he could  not see anybody else in the dazzling light [e'blouissement] which her eyes  cast upon him. (L'Education, 50/ 18)  From the impersonal, gender-neutral demonstrative pronoun "ce," the pas­ sage fans out into the epiphanic primal scene of the male subject's love plot,  as though both this subject and his fetish were simultaneously struck into  existence-or indeed, as though the fetish emerged before the subject, rup­ turing the "sad indefinite procession" of Flaubertian prose in order to gen­ erate in its own ravishing gaze the possibility of the subject's .  A hyperbolic,  even hallucinogenic moment of privacy secretes this subject: the fetish ex­ ists only for him, and likewise he exists only for "her" ("or at least he could  not see anybody else in the dazzling light which her eyes cast upon him").  20.  Numerous studies of recent date touch on the question of fetishism in Flaubert; see in  particular Charles Bernheimer's discussion of Bouvard et ?ecuchet in Flaubert and Kafka: Studies  in Psychopoetic Structure (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982), 102-38, and above all Tony  Tanner's discussion of Madame Bovary in Adultery and the Novel: Contract and Transgression  (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979), 233-367.  </page> <page sequence="11"> L'Education sentimentale 181  The wishfulness of this scenario shows up in the hint of uncertainty color­ ing the act of exclusion out of which male subject and female object emerge  ("or at least . . ." ); and the glory of the fetish resides in its ability to trans­ form this uncertainty into the pleasurable pain of the sublime. "Her" gaze  gives "him" sight as and through blindness (e'blouissement), at the same time  that she herself assumes the blindness of the object: her eyes cast light, but  do not see. The oedipal threat, minimally registered here as the ideal object's  power to blind, launches the subject of desire into its narrative of loss and  substitution. Pushing further, one might venture the claim that the fetish's  e'blouissement provides a mythical, Medusa-esque origin for the story of the  subject's eventual reification-an origin that we saw Fredric Jameson  fetishistically locating in the event of Flaubert.  What, then, is a fetish? A dazzlingly overdetermined locus of specula­ tion, knotting questions of language, religion, commerce, and desire. The  word returns etymologically to artifice or representation (facticius) by way  of the Portuguese feitifo. Originally signifying a token on which traders  took oaths to ratify commercial treaties on the African coast, the word feitifo  entered general European discourse at the end of the eighteenth century in  association with the religious practices of the "primitive" cultures Europe  was engaged in colonizing.21 In its "origins," then, the fetish marks and  guarantees the occurrence of discourse. It records the event of an oath or  promise, underwriting the oath's performative force, and thereby securing  commercial transactions. The fetish guarantees the promise that goods will  circulate by recording the circulation of language and desire. It performs, as  it were, the power of the performative and thereby draws on the arbitrary  (and "primitive" )  force of the divine. This densely linguistic dimension of  the fetish grants it great theoretical power. Though the Freudian and the  Marxist appropriations of this term to some extent move in opposite  directions-the former conceiving it as a palliative for loss, and the latter as  an occlusion of labor-both draw on the fetish as a figure for illusory  authority, and both elaborate this figure into a story of the production of a  subject of desire.  Marx's brief discussion of commodity fetishism in Capital has frequently  provided a springboard for sophisticated Marxist definitions of "ideology,"  because the fetishism Marx discovers in the commodity inheres in the  process of production rather than in the deluded consciousness of the con- 21. For a history of the term "fetish" see William Pietz, "The Problem of the Fetish," parts 1, 2,  and 3, in Res 9 (1985): 5-17, Res 13 (1987): 23-45, and Res 16 (1988): 105-23 .

"A commodity," Marx writes, "appears at first sight an extremely  obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange  thing . . . . [ A]s soon as it emerges as a commodity, it changes into a sensible  suprasensible thing [ein sinnlich ubersinnliches Ding] ."22 The commodity  generates the fetishistic illusion that value inheres in it as an object of  exchange: an illusion that Marx represents as a process of personification  and reification. A piece of wood, turned into a table turned into a com­ modity, "evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas," and this life of  the commodity springs from the reifying dynamic of commodity produc­ tion itself: "The mysterious character of the commodity-form consists  therefore simply in the fact that the commodity reflects the social charac­ teristics of men's own labour as objective characteristics of the products of  labour themselves . . . . T hrough this substitution, the products of labour  become commodities, sensuous things which are at the same time su­ prasensible or social" (Marx, Capital, 164-55). Crucial to Marx's insight,  though occasionally overlooked in marxist theory, is his understanding of  the commodity as both a rhetorical entity and an economic entity. Socially  organized human labor produces it, but it becomes a commodity, a "sensible  supersensible thing," only through the chiasmic exchange of properties  between person and thing.23 Self-obfuscation inheres in the production of  the commodity. This excess of production also implies that in coming into  existence the commodity generates a desire for itself over and above what­ ever attraction it might possess as a mere object. Commodity fetishism may  thus be said to produce for capitalism a desiring subject-a subject that  finds its epitome in the capitalist, whose unending desire to accumulate  wealth derives from the personification of structural relations: " [I]t is only  insofar as the appropriation of ever more wealth in the abstract is the sole  driving force behind his operations that he functions as a capitalist, i.e., as  22.

This exchange of properties consequently poses a problem of reading: "Value, therefore,  does not have its description branded on its forehead; it rather transforms every product of  labour into a social hieroglyphic. Later on, men try to decipher the hieroglyphic" (Marx, Capital,  167). Close readings of Capital have drawn attention to the rhetorical complexity of the com­ modity form in Marx's analysis: see especially Thomas Keenan, "The Point Is to (Ex)Change It:  Reading Capital, Rhetorically," in Fetishism as Cultural Discourse, ed. Apter and Pietz, 152-85.  Keenan examines the figure of "abstraction" that transforms use value-which is always  absolutely particular-into exchange value. This violent and impossible abstraction leaves as a  "residue" a "ghostly objectivity [gespenstige Gegenstiindlichkeit]" (Marx, Capital, 128), the "resi­ due of the abstraction itself" (Keenan, "The Point Is to (Ex)change It," 169). The play of ghosts  in Marx's text has also been analyzed by Jacques Derrida, in his Spectres de Marx: L'Etat de la  dette, le travail du deuil et la nouvelle Internationale (Paris: Galilee, 1993): see 246-79 for a discus­ sion of Marx's example of the table. The difficult figure of "use value" in Capital is analyzed in  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, "Scattered Speculations on the Question of Value," in her In Other  Worlds (New York: Routledge, 1988), 154-75.  </page> <page sequence="13"> L'Education sentimentale 183  capital personified and endowed with consciousness and a will" (Capital,  254). The odd, impersonal quality of desire in Flaubert, a blend of passivity  and insatiability that we earlier attached to allegorical language, may thus  also be represented in terms of the personifying force of commodity ex­ change: capitalism is in this sense the ferocious accomplishment of allegory.  Freud's more systematic rewriting of the notion of fetishism overtly lo­ cates the fetish at the origin of the subject's production as a subject of desire,  and thereby develops a complex understanding of the fetish's rhetorical  character. As a substitute for the missing maternal phallus, the fetish in  Freud is a radical fiction, and is compounded of seemingly contradictory  qualities: it provides pleasure and consolation only and precisely to the  extent that it memorializes a trauma. The (male) subject, reading its own  possibility in the mirror of the mother's lack, papers over this absence with  a substitute object; the subject's "interest" in this fictional penis then "suf­ fers an extraordinary increase" precisely because "the horror of castration  has set up a memorial [Denkmal] to itself in the creation of this substitute."24  Freud's analysis of the Medusa's head is perhaps his most evocative ac­ count of the fetish's ability to eroticize trauma by representing it. Since "to  decapitate" is "to castrate," the terror of Medusa is "a terror of castration  that is linked to the sight of something" -the female genitals, and "essen­ tially those of [the] mother."25 The snakes on the Medusa's head sym­ bolically threaten the male viewer since they recall the pubic hair surround­ ing the "castrated" maternal genitals; however, they also, simultaneously,  "serve as a mitigation of the horror, for they replace the penis, the absence  of which is the cause of the horror." Even the Medusa's power to petrify the  male observer is paradoxically consoling: "For becoming stiff means an  erection. Thus in the original situation it offers consolation to the spectator:  he is still in possession of a penis, and the stiffening reassures him of the  fact." The fetish is apotropaic because it represents the subject's annihila­ tion to the subject, which can thereby persuade itself of its own existence.  Freud's schema yields a further refinement: as in Frederic's first vision of  Mme Arnoux, the fetish may be understood as the occlusion not of lack but  of uncertainty. It requires an act of interpretation, after all, to see a lack,  particularly a lack taken as the anto deeper reality-of a penis's presence. ' nym-and the potential destiny, or  The maternal phallus would thus be  a fiction erected not over a void but over illegibility. Freud registered this  dimension of the fetish in epistemological terms as the mechanism of  24.

("The whole process seems so strange to us," Freud comments  dryly in a posthumous fragment, "because we take for granted the syn­ thetic nature of the processes of the ego. But we are clearly at fault in  this. " )26 Thus, despite its overwhelmingly visual retiology in Freud, the  fetish must in a sense be understood as prior to and productive of sight  rather than the product of it. The terrifying "sight of something" has to be  read as "something" to see before it can be "seen." One may thus speak of a  fetishism at the origin of perception itself.  In L'Education sentimentale the dynamic of fetishism inheres in the pro­ duction of subject and text, conditioning all forms of semiotic, economic,  and libidinal circulation in the "capital of the nineteenth century" in which  Frederic loves and shops.2 7 Desire is the desire of the commodity, and of the  maternal and feminine as commodity; yet if desire and its representation  express themselves through commodities, commodities, under the pres­ sure of so much desire, become tokens of an inarticulate madness in the  same way that Flaubert's text does. Whatever the cultural and socioeco­ nomic codes mobilized, for instance, when Arnoux marches into the narra­ tive line shod in "strange red boots, of Russian leather, decorated with blue  patterns" (L'Education, 48 / 16), the objects in question-minuscule versions  of Charles's cap in Madame Bovary-linger subtly past meaning, the occa­ sion of an odd, empty astonishment and the product of a pointless and  unstoppable fetishism. The self-annihilating aesthetic of the artwork, in this  scenario, comes to coincide with the most degraded sort of sublimity-or  vice versa: it would be equally accurate to say that Arnoux' s boots or  Charles's cap acquire the idiotic pointlessness of the artwork. The degrada­ tion of Arnoux's L'Art industriel into a ceramics factory and a trade in  religious kitsch may be read as one of the many jokes the text makes at the  expense of its own aestheticism, not to mention its future canonization.  As an essential part of its fetishistic project, Flaubert's text mirrors Fre­ deric's desire in funneling the polyvalent intensities and uncertainties of  the fetish into the figure of Mme Arnoux. In her case we may indeed say  that fetishism inheres in perception itself-so much so that Frederic can  construct memories of her that are more detailed than his initial perception  26.

As the fetish of fetishes, Mme Arnoux herself is unobtainable-in a Laca­ nian spirit one could say that she doesn't exist-and the objects that sub­ stitute for her meet Frederic's desire with the arbitrary convenience of  commodities in a shopping gallery. Though it is true that over the course of  the narrative he pays particular homage to Mme Arnoux' s feet, the other  treasured objects of his gaze-her umbrella, her basket, pieces of  clothing-are so numerous and so democratically invested with signifi­ cance that the integrity of the fetish immediately finds itself com­ promised.28 In fetishism, as Emily Apter observes, "a consistent displacing  of reference occurs, paradoxically, as a result of so much fixing."29 Mme  Arnoux' s dispersal inheres in her fetishization; only the pathos of repetition  separates the beginning of the sentimental education from its end in the  "vente de Mme Arnoux," when the fetish is scattered into memorials to be  mourned in the sonorous rhythms of an extreme unction:  In this way there vanished, one after another, the big blue carpet with its  pattern of camellias which her dainty feet used to touch lightly as they  came toward him; the little tapestry easy-chair in which he always used to  sit facing her when they were alone; the two fire-screens, whose ivory had  been made smoother by the touch of her hands; and a velvet pincushion,  still bristling with pins. He felt as if a part of his heart were disappearing  with each article; and the monotonous effect of the same voices accom­ panied by the same gestures numbed him with fatigue, afflicting him with  a deathly torpor, a sense of disintegration. (387-88 / 407)30  The very force unifying Mme Arnoux into "the point of light on which all  things converged" (53 I 22) scatters her into a litany of coveted detail; and  the self that reads its identity in Mme Arnoux eventually finds itself  28. The arbitrary, metonymic quality of Frederic's fetishism is examined in Maureen Jameson,  "Metonymie et trahison dans L'Education sentimentale," Nineteenth-Century French Studies 19.4  (1991): 566-82; see also Michal Peled Ginsburg, Flaubert Writing: A Study in Narrative Strategies  (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1986), 132-5y "Dussardier and Madame Arnoux are  indeed ideal mirror images, marked by purity, unity, and stability; but the qualities that make  them into ideal mirror images are produced arbitrarily and contingently, and this fact under­ mines the very notion of ideal mirror image" (148).  29.

This numbness, fatigue, and disintegration recall the  problems and seductions of literary language, since the "monotonous  effect" of the auctioneers' gestures and voices is teasingly similar to the  iterative splendor of the famous Flaubertian imperfect ("que ses pieds mig­ nons frolaient . . ." ; "ml il s'asseyait toujours . . ." ) .31 If Mme Arnoux "re­ semble[ s] the women of romantic novels" (53 I 22), her lover, appropriately,  resembles a frenzied connoisseur: "He knew the shape of each of her nails;  he delighted in listening to the rustle of her silk dress when she passed  through doors; he furtively sniffed at the scent on her handkerchief; her  comb, her gloves, her rings were things of special significance to him, as  important as works of art, almost animated like people; they all took possession  of his heart and strengthened his passion" (92 / 66, emphasis added). The  fetish of fetishes is the artwork and the woman as artwork: the "point  lurnineux" of Mme Arnoux that substitutes itself for the Virgin, the phallus,  and the aesthetic symbol, and simultaneously disappears into the anon­ ymity of exchange.  It is in this matrix of fetishism that the text's articulation of "love" and  "history" will need to be sought. Yet first we may briefly observe that the  very omnipresence of fetishism in this novel renders legibly arbitrary and  overdetermined the text's repetition of Frederic's fetishization of Mme Ar­ noux. Though L'Education sentimentale certainly leaves little space for any  very satisfying feminine subject position,32 the novel may at least be said to  demonstrate the inextricability of aesthetic history, phallocentrism, and  commodification, and to suggest that only the contingency of artifice, fac­ ticius, determines this tradition's erection of the maternal phallus as a figure  for its fears and desires. A radical critique of this sort has its practical uses.  Flaubert's texts at once predict and demystify the reactive gesture of a  31 .  More violent, punctual instances of the fetish's fragmenting power also occur in the text.  After Rosanette's appearance at the beginning of the second part of the novel, Frederic dreams  of being raped and castrated by her, after seeing dismembered pieces of women pass back and  forth: " [I]n the hallucination of his first sleep he saw passing to and fro before him the Fish­ wife's shoulders, the Stevedore's back, the Polish girl's calves, and the Savage Woman's hair.  Then two big dark eyes [i.e., Mme Arnoux's], which were not at the ball, appeared; and light as  butterflies, bright as torches, they darted here and there, quivered, flew up to the ceiling, then  swooped down to his lips. Frederic struggled to recognize those eyes, without success. But  already a dream had taken hold of him; he thought he was harnessed side by side with Arnoux  in the shafts of a cab, and the Marshal, sitting astride him, was tearing his belly open with her  golden spurs" (L'Education, i52/ 134). The more irresolute passages we are focusing on may be  read as counterweights to such aggressively focused, oedipal scenarios.  32. See L. Czyba, Mythes et ideologie de la Femme dans les romans de Flaubert (Lyon: Presses  Universitaires de Lyon, 1983), for a study of the misogynistic stereotypes at work both in  Flaubert's texts and in French culture from the July Monarchy and the 1848 Revolution through  the 1870s. Czyba points out that L'Education sentimentale (mis)represents the 1848 Revolution as  an exclusively male affair, barring figures of satire such as Mlle Vatnaz.  </page> <page sequence="17"> L'Education sentimentale 187  reader such as Jean-Paul Sartre, who, seeking to bring the "derealized"  language of the Flaubertian text back to the certainties of experience, seizes  upon a maternal scapegoat: "Flaubert's fetishism is the result and the sum­ mation of his sexual unrealizations, and these cannot be understood apart  from the original derealization. His mother, male impersonator by impos­ ture, woman by betrayal, constituted him such that he never stopped de­ manding from her a form of sexual retotalization that she had denied him  from the cradle, and subsequently revealed herself incapable by nature of  giving him."33 Everything finally returns to nature, thanks to the mother­ and it is her fault to boot: the mother represents at once "nature" and  nature's lack or insufficiency. She is the ground of language, and her crime  consists in ungrounding it. The fetishistic character of Sartre's argument is  all the more striking in that he is basing it on a confessedly baseless fantasy:  "The truth of this reconstruction cannot be proved; its likelihood is not  measurable" (1 :56); "This is a fabrication, I confess. I have no proof that it  was so" (1 : 139). But soon enough the fantasy turns into fact: "It was his  mother's pious and glacial zeal that constituted Gustave a passive agent;  Mme Flaubert was the source of this 'nature' and the malaise through  which it was expressed" (1 : 180). The energy with which Sartre repeats  Frederic's discovery of the oedipal radiance of a maternal Mme Arnoux  responds to a literary insistence that exceeds and undermines the very  fetish it composes. As always within the orbit of aesthetics, the uncertain  status of language is a political issue, a matter for the paterfamilias, if not,  indeed, for the police.34  33.

In the original French version the quotation  comes from volume 1: see L'Idiot de la famille: Gustave Flaubert de 1821 ii 1857 (Paris: Gallimard,  1971), 1 :719-20. The emphasis on "by nature" in this passage is Sartre's.  34. Flauberfs densely textured critique of the presuppositions at work in Sartre's fantasy is  particularly visible early in the novel when Frederic reads the words "Jacques Arnoux" on a  marble plaque and thinks of "elle" (L'Education, 62-63 / 32)-Mme Arnoux, of course, though  grammatically the pronoun also applies to the "plaque de marbre" on which the paternal name  (which also here signifies the commercial entity L'Art industriel) is inscribed. A few pages later  Frederic's fetishization of this signifier becomes more pronounced: "The big letters spelling out  the name of Arnoux on the marble plaque above the shop seemed to him to be unique and  pregnant with meaning, like a sacred writing [grosses de signification, comme une ecriture sacree ]"  (77 I 49 ). The fetishization, which is to say the aestheticization, of the name of the father­ capitalist occurs here through an assimilation of writing to a putatively natural power of  (re)production ("pregnancy"). The mother thereby becomes the ground-the "plaque de  marbre" -of meaning's inscription. Here, however, the arbitrariness and excess of Frederic's  gesture forms part of the text to be read, as does the relation of his idealizing and reifying focus  on the maternal to the other dimensions of the fetish in L'Education sentimentale: the commodity,  the artwork, and so on. A full study of gender and desire in L'Education would also want to  examine desire's homoerotic circuits, visible here and elaborated elsewhere as Frederic's  charged relations with Arnoux and above all with Deslauriers.

This commemorative aspect, however, is also paradoxically mobile and  . uncertain, since the fixing and freezing energies of the fetish generate an  equivalent displacement and disintegration. As representations, in other  words, fetishes are always inauthentic, above all in their representation of  "history." Flaubert famously constructed his "historical" scenes out of pre­ processed data-memoirs, newspapaper reports, and so on-in order to  tease into blank irony the stereotyped discourse that masquerades as his­ torical truth. Indeed, in his representation of Frederic's one sustained expe­ rience of a dramatic revolutionary event-the sack of the Tuileries on Feb­ ruary 24-Flaubert not only draws heavily on "the 'one says' [on dit] of  1848, as represented in stereotypes," but draws attention to the fetishistic  character of verbal stereotypes by recycling sexual ones.35 The crowd's  "frenzy" in the Tuileries ("An obscene curiosity caused everyone to ransack  all the closets, search all the alcoves, and turn out all the drawers. Jailbirds  thrust their arms into the princesses' bed, and rolled about on it as a con­ solation for not being able to rape them" [ L'Education, 289 I 289])  recalls and  parodies one of the best-known scenarios in Burke's Reflections on the Revo­ lution in France: "A band of cruel ruffians and assassins . . . r ushed into the  chamber of the queen, and pierced with an hundred strokes of bayonets  and poniards the bed, from whence this persecuted woman had but just  time to flee almost naked."36 Where Burke's rioters are bloodthirsty,  Flaubert's jailbirds are always at least faintly ludicrous: in 1848 tragedy  occurs as farce, and the revolution's symbols and archetypes-even that of  the Medusa herself-have become commodities and cliches, and possess in  consequence a ridiculous yet desperate power: "In the entrance hall, stand­ ing on a pile of clothes, a prostitute [une fille pudique] was posing as a statue  of Liberty, motionless and terrifying, her eyes wide open" ( 289 I 290 ). 37 Such  35.

The figure of the Medusa had in fact  </page> <page sequence="19"> L'Education sentimentale 189  visions are likely to strike us as historical only in the sense in which history  can be understood as simply another discourse, another tissue of com­ monplaces and prescripted tropes, or outlet for ideological representations.  Yet the notion of the fetish as inscription or Denkmal nonetheless offers us  the chance to think history in non-ontic fashion. To gain a better sense of  this historicity we may, as it were, travel deeper into the heart of the fetish  by looking closely at the two major instances in which Frederic misses  history while embroiled in the aporia of his love plot. The first occurs at the  beginning of the 1848 Revolution: Frederic refuses to join his friends in a  demonstration on February 22, the first day of revolutionary activity, be­ cause of his rendezvous with Mme Arnoux; and because she stands him up,  he spends February 23 courting Rosanette, and misses the day of rioting  which led to the revolution itself. He thus experiences the "origin" of the  revolution as an agony of waiting for the fetish-woman who never arrives,  and as a compensatory lateral move in his sentimental education. Later in  the year Frederic misses the proletarian uprising in June-"the most co­ lossal event [Ereignis] in the history of European civil wars" (Marx, Eight­ eenth Brumaire, 23)-because he and Rosanette have left Paris for a holiday  in Fontainebleau. Let me begin by examining the Fontainebleau idyll,  which overtly thematizes the fetish's power to romanticize and commodify  history.  For the male and middle-class Frederic, Fontainebleau provides history  as erotic nostalgia. As he stands before the painting of Diana in the Ban­ queting Hall, the "point lumineux" of Mme Arnoux becomes the star-like  radiance of Diane de Poitiers:  The most beautiful of these legendary creatures was shown in a painting  on the right, in the character of Diana the huntress, and indeed of Diana of  the Underworld, no doubt to indicate the power she wielded even beyond  the grave. All these symbols confirmed her fame; and something of her  still remained there, a faint voice, a lingering splendour [rayonnement] .  become a charged stereotype of the era: for an analysis of its functioning, see Neil Hertz,  "Medusa's Head: Male Hysteria under Political Pressure," in The End of the Line: Essays on  Psychoanalysis and the Sublime (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), 161-215. Drawing  on various accounts of 1848 and the Commune in order to comment on "a recurrent tum of  mind: the representation of what would seem to be a political threat as if it were a sexual  threat," Hertz, following Freud, suggests that the image of Medusa concentrates "a litany of  nervous questions" :  "questions that give expression to epistemological anxiety (can I trust my  eyes?), to narcissism (can I hold myself together?), to sexual anxiety (can I hold on to my  penis?), to-beyond that-social and economic fears about property and status (can I hold on  to anything, including representations of myself?)" ( 167). The tranformation of such uncertain­ ty into a charged, specular confrontation with sexual difference works tq buttress the fetishistic  illusion "that one can see history as the features of a face, read it off a composed physiognomy"  (179).  </page> <page sequence="20"> 190 Phantom Formations  Frederic was seized with an inexpressible feeling of retrospective lust  [concupiscence] . (L'Education, 313-14 / 319-20)  This sharply focused fetishization of the past mutates into Frederic and  Rosanette's literary and touristic consumption of the Fontainebleau forest.  Their guide takes them to the famous spots; the narrative voice pursues  medieval fantasies in indirect free style ("on pense aux ermites, compag­ nons des grands cerfs . . ." ); and the forest acquires the trappings of sym­ bolic meaning: "Some [trees], astonishingly tall, bore themselves like pa­ triarchs or emperors, or, touching each other at the tip, seemed to form  triumphal arches with their long trunks; others, grown obliquely from the  ground, seemed columns about to fall" (316/  323). Arrived at this "foret de  symboles" we find ourselves at the locus of much interpretative or pseudo­ interpretative activity, both in the text itself and in the criticism it has  inspired. Here the trees are like triumphal arches and falling columns; a  little further on they resemble a crowd [fou le], while also possessing crowns  [ couronnes] like the ruler whom the crowd swept away in February. In short,  the forest of Fontainebleau, symbol of royal, mystical France, offers itself as  a symbolization and naturalization of history; yet as soon as one takes up its  offer, of course, one repeats Frederic's fetishism. History and the love plot  entwine here precisely to the extent that one falls into the text's trap.38  Nonetheless, it will prove interesting to continue to follow Frederic and  Rosanette into the fetish-forest, since as their tour continues the text's lan­ guage becomes excessive in a mode difficult-as so often in Flaubert-to  pin down. From the unremarkably catachretic "crowns" of the beech trees  we are moved through a descriptive catalogue that grows more and more  baroque in its tropes: holly bushes seemingly "made of bronze"; birches  bent in "elegiac attitudes"; pines "symmetrical as organ-pipes" that  "seemed to sing as they swayed continuously to and fro"; finally, "huge  38. For a relatively straightforward reading of the Fontainebleau episode as a naturalization of  history, see Brombert, "L'Education sentimentale: Articulations et polyvalence," and his The  Novels of Flaubert (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966), 177-78; see Brooks for a similar  reading, which concludes that the political message of Flaubert's text is quietism (Reading for the  Plot, 203-4). Culler's discussion of Fontainebleau, directed against Brombert, emphasizes the  text's ironic disqualification of the symbolic reading by noting that the natural analogy-trees  that look like emperors or triumphal arches or columns about to fall-cuts two opposing ways:  "Is political revolution an act of desecration like chopping down monarchical trees or destroy­ ing the Empire's monuments, or does the very posture of trees which look like columns about  to fall offer a natural analogue which refutes the former suggestion?" From the first perspec­ tive, the natural analogy would underline the "tragic seriousness of political revolution" as an  assault on a natural order; from the second, revolution would itself become a natural phenome­ non, and the merely human sort would fade into "triviality and insignificance." The text gives  us no means to privilege one option over the other: "It is clear that everything can be inter­ preted," Culler concludes, "but not what is the significance of such interpretations" (Flaubert,  102).  </page> <page sequence="21"> L'Education sentimentale 191  gnarled oaks" that "rose convulsively out of the ground, embraced one  another, and solidly established on their torso-like trunks, threw out their  bare arms in desperate appeals and furious threats, like a group of Titans  struck motionless in their anger" (316-17 I 323) .  The passage hovers be­ tween reification and personification, since its tropological progression first  swerves in an inanimate direction ("made of bronze" ), then employs a  technical rather than a natural anthropomorphic vehicle (organ-pipes) be­ fore leaping to an Ovidian idiom (the Titans). The twin tropes of fetishism  collapse into each other and in doing so become hyperbolic, manifestly  rhetorical fictions: it is as though these trees were registering the produc­ tion of figurative language itself, prior to the establishment of the binary  oppositions (animate / inanimate, person/ thing) upon which the tropes of  personification and reification draw.  It is precisely such an uncanny principle of textual production, I suggest,  which drives Flaubert's paragraph toward a climax wickedly balanced  �etween sublimity and irony:  Then they crossed monotonous clearings, planted with saplings here and  there. A sound of iron, hard and numerous blows rang out; it was a team of  quarrymen striking the rocks on a hillside. These rocks became more and  more numerous, finally filling the whole landscape; cube-shaped like  houses, or flat like paving-stones, they propped each other up, overhung  one another, and merged together like the monstrous, unrecognizable  ruins of some vanished city. But the frenzied chaos in which they lay  conjured up rather thoughts of volcanoes, floods, great unknown  cataclysms. Frederic said that they had been there since the beginning of  the world and would stay like that until its end; Rosanette turned her head  away, saying that "it would drive her mad," and went off to pick some  heather. (317 I 323)  It is easy to interpret these apocalyptic rocks as signs of "the futility of [the  revolution of 1848] in relation to geological revolutions" (Brombert, "L'Edu­ cation," 61 ), and also easy to cast suspicion on that sublime interpretation,  which is specifically identified as Frederic's both in this passage and again,  more pointedly, a little later in the episode: "Sometimes they heard the roll  of drums far away in the distance . . . . ' Why, of course! It's the insurrection!'  Frederic would say with a disdainful pity, for all that excitement struck him  as trivial in comparison with their love and eternal Nature" (318 / 325) .  Yet  this familiar Flaubertian paradox, whereby an interpretation is rendered at  once silly and inevitable, does not entirely exhaust the passage's difficulty.  We may begin with the simple observation that the scene does not appear to  be describing "nature" at all. Prior to "conjuring up" thoughts of volcanoes  </page> <page sequence="22"> 192 Phantom Formations  and floods and inspiring Frederic's sublime commonplace, the rocks are  "houses" and "paving-stones" arranged in ways that resemble the "ruins of  some vanished city"; whether or not they have gotten that way because "a  team of quarrymen" is "striking" them, they record in their figurative  shapes the expenditure of labor power. Should one then discover at work in  this scene a "political unconscious"? Perhaps; so long as one does not  imagine that either the proletarian uprising of the June days or labor in the  abstract (i.e., the commodity) is the repressed truth of these rocks: such  allegories would finally be as hasty and naturalizing as Frederic's, if only  because the activity of "striking the rocks" (battant les roches ) is not even  necessarily labor. If it is, it is labor in the sense that writing (in Flaubert's  sense) is labor: hard work, no doubt, and productive of marks and sounds,  and words and figures, yet work that is as useless as that of the prisoner,  who in the French diche that would be this passage's Riffaterrean hypo­ gram if it had a hypogram, is condemned to break rocks, casser les cailloux.  We risk misreading the figurative structure of the passage, however, if we  seize too eagerly on the pathos that figures of social injustice provide. Like  the prisoner, the "team of quarrymen striking the rocks on a hillside" is  engaged in the redundancy of striking rocks so as to produce rocks-but  these are not just any old rocks: "These rocks became more and more  numerous, finally filling the whole landscape; cube-shaped like houses."  This rock-striking produces the rocks upon which the fetish-the fetish of  interpretation-stages itself. We may say without the slightest exaggera­ tion that the text is figuring the possibility of its own coming into being.  This allegory of textual production intensifies as Frederic and  Rosanette' s close encounter with rocks comes to a climax in the next para­ graph, and the silent, solar logos of light itself "strikes" the fetish into  phantasmatic life:  One day they climbed half-way up a sand-hill. Its surface, untrodden  [ vierge de pas], was grooved with symmetrical undulations; here and there,  like promontories on the dried-up bed of an ocean, rose rocks which bore a  vague resemblance to animals, tortoises thrusting their heads forward,  seals crawling along, hippopotamuses, and bears. Not a soul. Not a sound.  The sand, struck by the sun, was dazzling [ e'blouissant]; and all of a sudden,  in that quivering of the light, the animals seemed to move. They hurried  away, fleeing vertigo [fuyant le vertige], almost panic-stricken. (317/ 324)  The rochers de Fontainebleau are famous for their shapes: we have certainly  not left the circuit of the tourist, nor indeed the orbit of the ridiculous, as  </page> <page sequence="23"> L'Education sentimentale 193  these tourists, after all, are running away from rocks.39 But the text has also  moved us into the denatured, erotic, oriental, and pointless world of Saint  Antoine, and toward what Jonathan Culler calls Flaubert's notion of the  "sacred" : that is, "pure form" (Flaubert, 223 ), "the sentimental purified by  irony, emptied of its content, so that it may come to represent in the allegory  of interpretation the formal desire for connection and meaning" (226),  which is to say a textuality built on "arbitrary meanings guaranteed not by  man but by God" (227). We could almost agree with these shrewd charac­ terizations, were it not for the persistent impurity of irony and formal  closure in Flaubert. In the vocabulary developed here we may say that the  sacred is always also a fetish. Yet Culler's comments respond to a predica­ ment latent within fetishism: the fetish elicits as its condition of possibility a  disruptive institution of the signifier which must occur "before" any mean­ ing can guarantee this signifier 's  legibility. If the production of meaning is  the production of the fetish, that institutive act of fetishism itself entails an  impossible act of personification (or "reification" ) prior to the existence of  persons or things. The rocks bearing a "vague resemblance" to the exotic  animals of the Flaubertian imagination, which "seem to move" when struck  by light-by the "eblouissement" that earlier shone out of the eyes of the  "apparition" of Mme Arnoux-figure the production of meaning as per­ sonification, as the production of "figure" itself out of the uncertainty that is  the condition of all signification, and which here leaves its mark as the  image of ambiguous marks: a surface "vierge de pas," "rayee en ondula­ tions symmetriques."  We encounter a similar pressure of the inscription within the fetishistic  dilemma suffered by Frederic a few pages earlier in the novel, and a few  months earlier in the plot, as he waits for Mme Arnoux at the corner of the  Rue Tronchet on February 22, while the first crowds of the revolution  gather in the Place de la Concorde. As the hours pass, the strain of waiting  causes him to "dissolve in despair" :  The echo of his footsteps jarred his brain.  When he saw that his watch said four o'clock he felt a sort of dizziness  and panic. He tried to recite some poetry to himself, to do a sum at  random, to make up a story. It was impossible! he was obsessed by the  image of Madame Arnoux. He longed to run and meet her. But which way  should he go so as not to miss her? (277 I 277-78)  The subject of fetishism here suffers the fragmentation inherent in fetishis­ tic unification, a crisis of the subject which is equally one of narrative- 39. I owe that last phrase to Susan Crane. This is perhaps a good place to thank my colleagues  at the Camargo Foundation for their helpful responses to early portions of this chapter.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 194 Phantom Formations  Frederic cannot "make up a story [histoire]" any more than he can choose a  direction to run in, for he is pinned by the fictionality of the fetish into the  predicament of waiting endlessly for its arrival. The story of his waiting is  brought to an end only retrospectively, when a few pages later we learn that  "Frederic had gone home" : "He sank in to a kind of sleep; through his  nightmare he heard the rain falling, and imagined all the time that he was  still out there on the pavement" (279 / 281) .   In between Frederic's waiting and his dream of waiting, the text tells the  story of why Mme Arnoux does not arrive: a story that itself begins as her  own dream of waiting:  The night before, she had dreamt that she had been standing for a long  time on the pavement in the Rue Tronchet. She was waiting there for  something indefinite yet important, and without knowing why, she was  afraid of being seen. But a horrible little dog which had taken a dislike to  her was worrying the hem of her dress. It kept coming back to her and  barked louder and louder. Madame Arnoux awoke. The dog's barking  went on. She strained her ears. The noise was coming from her son's  bedroom. She rushed into the room in her bare feet. It was the child  himself who was coughing. His hands were burning hot, his face red and  his voice strangely hoarse. (278 / 278-79)  This barking or coughing will later be described as being "like the noise  made by the crude devices that make cardboard dogs bark" (278 / 279): it  resembles mechanically produced noises that resemble natural noises, and  manifests itself as an impediment to speech: " [The child] seemed to be  puffing out his words" (280) ("On aurait dit qu[e l'enfant] soufflait ses  paroles" [279] ) . The cough interrupts Mme Arnoux's dream only to rewrite  the dream as reality, transforming the suspension of waiting into a more  agonizing vigil:  The hours went by, heavy, dreary, interminable, heartbreaking; and she  counted the minutes only by the progression of this death-agony. The  spasms of his chest threw him forward as if they were going to break him  up; finally he vomited something strange which resembled a tube of par­ chment. What was it? She supposed that he had thrown up a piece of his  bowels. But he was breathing freely and regularly. This apparent improve­ ment frightened her more than anything else; and she was standing there  petrified [petrifiee], her arms dangling and her eyes fixed in a stare, when  Monsieur Colot arrived. According to him, the child was out of danger.  (279 / 280-81)  </page> <page sequence="25"> L'Education sentimentale 195  If the cough at once interrupts and causes Mme Arnoux' s torment of wait­ ing, the cessation of the cough might be said to produce Frederic's, since  Mme Arnoux, interpreting her child's spontaneous cure as a sign from God,  offers up her love for Frederic "as a sacrifice" (281) .  Flaubert's notes on  croup, taken from Trousseau's Clinique medicale, are more prosaic: "It some­ times happens, one time out of six or eight, that, through an act of vomiting  or coughing, the larynx clears itself all of a sudden, the child spitting out  strips of false membranes [fausses membranes] or membranal tissues coming  from the trachea and the glottis."40 And an interpretation of this scene  adequate to its peculiarities will need to be more prosaic still, which is not  always to say more self-evident.  We have seen that the fetish is a visual affair: a double-edged gift of  blinding vision, brought into focus here as the figure-once again-of the  medusal mother, "petrified," "her eyes fixed in a stare." And we have also  seen that these paradoxes of vision negotiate a predicament that is not  visual but figural. Vision is a hypothesis that can never be guaranteed, no  matter how hard the fetish tries; and I suggest we understand the emer­ gence of aural stimuli such as the "sound of iron" in the Fontainebleau  scene or little Eugene Arnoux' s cough in this one as signals that relay the  non-phenomenal inscription of the fetish's phenomenality. Read in this  way, these sounds are not actually sounds at all; or, better, they are sounds  that record the uninsurable event whereby they are taken as sounds, just as  the fetish is taken as a vision ("une apparition" ). Speculating on the priv­ ilege Freud grants to aural perception in the primal scene, Jean Laplanche  and J.-B. Pontalis suggest that "hearing, when it occurs, breaks the con- 40. The note continues: "-at that instant calm descends. The child falls asleep. But often  another false membrane forms itself and the sickness begins again." Flaubert's notes are repro­ duced in the Club de l'Honnete Homme edition, 452-53; they may also be found in Dumesnil,  L'Education sentimentale de Gustave Flaubert, 54. According to Dr. Chaume, who was in charge of  tracheotomies when Flaubert visited the Hopital Sainte-Eugenie (now the Hopital Trousseau)  in March of 1868, and who published an account of the visit in the Chronique medicale of 15  December 1900, Flaubert was too squeamish to attend an operation. Dumsenil draws from this  episode a rationale for Flaubert's decision to have Mme Amoux's child cure itself spon­ taneously; we are seeking here the possibility of a less reductive explanation.  From Trousseau's study Flaubert also, for that matter, acquired the metaphor "a tube of  parchment" to describe the false membranes blocking the larynx: "What occurs there," Trous­ seau writes, "is what occurs if, between the reeds of a clarinet or bassoon, you interpose a bit of  wet parchment; and the comparison is all the more exact in that the false membrane can be  perfectly well compared to a bit of parchment swollen by humidity. The reed instrument  constituted by the larynx thus no longer works." A. Trousseau, Clinique medicale de l 'Hotel-Dieu  de Paris, 2 vols. (Paris: J.-B. Bailliere et Fils, 1861), 1 :320-21 .  Trousseau is drawn to the pathos of  the loss of voice engendered by the croup, and goes on at some length about the sound of the  cough, the tone of any surviving voice, and so on. Flaubert's notes are taken from pages 319-23  of this volume. Flaubert's comment that the relatively rare spontaneous cure for the croup often  results in the growth of more membranous tissue, however, runs slightly counter to his source:  Trousseau emphasizes that the spontaneous ejection of false membrane actually results in a  better rate of cure than the tracheotomy does (323).  </page> <page sequence="26"> 196 Phantom Formations  tinuity of an undifferentiated perceptual field and at the same time is a sign  (the noise waited for and heard in the night), which puts the subject in the  position of having to answer to something."41 Laplanche and Pontalis are  working through the psychoanalytic version of the paradox of the constitu­ tive event. The trauma of sexuality produces the subject, which must none­ theless preexist this event in order to experience it, and which consequently  internalizes sexuality belatedly, as a repetition always already in place. The  "sound" of the primal scene is the call of the signifier: an inaudible call  which cannot be guaranteed by any intention, yet which is "heard" as  intentional by the subject it constitutes or interpellates. This call echoes in  Eugene's cough as a mechanical resistance to voice, and as a near-shattering  force ("the spasms of his chest threw him forward as if they were going to  break him up"); it inhabits the "striking" of the rocks at Fontainebleau as  the doubleness of a sound at once singular ("un bruit de fer" ) and iterative  ("des coups drus et nombreux" ).  One could thus say that Eugene coughs up the signifier's residue. The  "something" which resembles "a tube of parchment" suggests the mate­ riality of an event inaccessible to experience-a "sublime object of ideol­ ogy," in Slavoj Zizek' s phrase: that is, "a positive, material object elevated to  the status of the impossible Thing."42 Zizek's Lacanian terminology of the  "real," however, lends a misleading substantiality to this diseased, vomited  remainder, or excess of voice. As the residue of the signifier, these "false  membranes" are neither real nor unreal, just as they are neither organic nor  inorganic. The materiality of the signifier is the condition of the difference  between dream and reality, or more generally between figure and ground.  It is the blow of an event which has no singularity apart from its repetition,  yet which is iterable only as the trauma of a radical, unanswerable sin­ gularity. And we may note at this juncture that the cough of the child  continues to echo as the second volume of the novel doses. Wending their  way back from a restaurant-the Trois Freres proveni;aux, where Flaubert  and Maxime du Camp were also eating, that night of 23 February­ Frederic and Rosanette hear "a crackling noise behind them like the sound  of a huge piece of silk being ripped in two. It was the fusillade on the  Boulevard des Capucines." At the house in the Rue Tronchet which Fre­ deric had prepared for Mme Arnoux, and where he now takes Rosanette,  the chapter doses with a final invocation of uncertain sounds: "About one  41 .

At this point in Laplanche and Pontalis's argument  the most immediate reference is to "A Case of Paranoia" (1915), in which Freud describes the  case of a woman patient whose fears were at once visual and aural: she felt she was being  watched and photographed while lying with her lover, and claimed to have heard a "noise,''  the click of a camera.  42.

To her query Frederic explains  that he is crying out of an /1 excess of happiness" : "I've been wanting you too  long!" (282 / 283) .  The blows on the rocks and distant roll of drums in the  Fontainebleau scene, the repercussion of Frederic's waiting feet, the bark of  a dog, the cough of a child, the crackling of a fusillade, the /1 distant rum­ blings" and the gentleman's sob, mark the trace of a violence prior to and  yet of signification; and we may say that these marks inscribe an allegory of  history in the heart of the love-plot, at the point of love's non­ consummation.  I V   Why history? Because history remains the best name we can give to  the excess, the radical exteriority, of an event in relation to meaning, knowl­ edge, or desire. The thought of history always appeals at a certain point to  referential force: we say, when pressed, that history is what happened, what  really happened-"what hurts," in Fredric Jameson's somewhat wishful  epigram, which hustles the referential difficulty of "what really happened"  a little too quickly into the subjective certainty of pain. But one could  venture the formulation that history is pain that cannot be experienced.  Flaubert's focus on trauma responds to the historical novel's conceit that  history can be captured as narrative, which is an ambition latent in all  aesthetic narrative. Indeed, the deepest motivation of aesthetics is discover­ able in its attempt to gather the referential insistence of "history" into the  totality of consciousness or form. In its critical displacement of this project,  L'Education sentimentale rewrites Bildung as the making, factio, of a feiti&lt;;o, a  fetish, and suggests that the subject /1 experiences" history as an inexplicable  interruption, or the fragmenting anguish of intolerable boredom. From the  subject's perspective, history can only be enountered as trauma: as the  "parole soufflee" of an occurrence that arrives too early or too late for the  consciousness it makes possible.43  43. See Jacques Derrida, "La parole soufflee," in Writing and Difef rence, trans. Alan Bass  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 19j'S), 169-95, for a meditation on the "parole  soufflee" -the word whispered, prompted, spirited away-of a "historicity long since elimi­ nated from thought" (170), the impossible "ground" of metaphysical differences (174): "Which  amounts to acknowledging the autonomy of the signifier as the letter's historicity; before me,  the signifier on its own says more than I believe that I meant to say, and in relation to it, my  meaning-to-say is submissive rather than active" (178). For an exploration of the relation  b!!tween history and trauma, see Cathy Caruth, "Unclaimed Experience: Trauma and the  Possibility of History," Yale French Studies 79 (1991): 181-92: "The historical power of the trauma  is not just that the experience is repeated after its forgetting, but that it is only in and through its  inherent forgetting that it is first experienced at all. . . . F or history to be a history of trauma  </page> <page sequence="28"> 198 Phantom Formations  Suspended between futurity and anteriority, the historical event, in L'Ed­ ucation sentimentale, becomes the aporetic narrative of love. Love tells the  deconstructive story of its own inability to catch up with itself: it cannot  know what it does, or do what it knows, precisely because its origins and  mode of existence are historical. Love's literariness-that is, its dissym­ metrical affirmation and destruction of itself as fiction-is in fact its histo­ ricity: love occurs, as an event that cannot be present to itself. The event of  love manifests itself as fetishism, and the paradox of love plays itself out as  a tension between the production and dispersal of identity and meaning in  and as the fetish. And the subject that finds its possibility in the fetishization  of love's aporia is indeed the subject "of history" -which means that it is in  fact possible to think the scriptive force of history as "labor," so long as one  specifies that the historicity of labor power resides not in labor's dialectical  negation of the real, but in its opacity to its own intention, and its excess  over any system of calculation and distribution.  We may say more generally that the lesson of L'Education sentimentale is  that history is the production of a text. One should not rush toward the  comfort of declaring such an insight idealist or bourgeois. Marx's com­ ments at the beginning of the Eighteenth Brumaire refer us to a linguistic  example precisely in order to declare history irreducible to consciousness:  Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please;  they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under  circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.  The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the  brain of the living. And just when they seem engaged in revolutionizing  themselves and things, in creating something that has never yet existed,  precisely in such periods of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up  the spirits [Geister] of the past to their service and borrow from them  names, battle cries and costumes in order to present the new scene of  world history in this time-honored disguise and this borrowed lan­ guage . . . .  In like manner a beginner who has learnt a new language  always translates it back into his mother tongue, but he has assimilated the  spirit [Geist] of the new language and can freely express himself in it only  when he finds his way in it without recalling the old and forgets his native  tongue in the use of the new. (Eighteenth Brumaire, 15-16)  Just when we think we are breaking with the past we are most haunted by  it; we begin to speak the language of the new only insofar as we "forget" the  means that it is referential precisely to the extent that it is not fully perceived as it occurs; or to  put it somewhat differently, that a history can be grasped only in the very inaccessibility of its  occurrence" (187).  </page> <page sequence="29"> L'Education sentimentale 199  "mother tongue" of our own identity, which is to say that revolution occurs  only in the eclipse of revolutionary consciousness. There is more empirical  plausibility to such a paradox than might immediately meet the eye. It is  not simply the complexity of causal relations that leads Franz Fanon to  ascribe a certain randomness to the revolutionary event: " [I]n these circum­ stances the guns go off by themselves, for nerves are jangled, fear reigns  and everyone is trigger-happy. . . . I t must be remarked here that the politi­ cal parties have not called for armed insurrection, and have made no prepa­ rations for such an insurrection. All these repressive measures, all those  actions which are a result of fear are not within the leader 's intentions: they  are overtaken by events."44 So far as we know, the massacre on the Boule­ vard des Capucines toward which Frederic is so indifferent, which left  some hundred or so dead and helped precipitate Louis Philippe's fall,  occurred without any officer giving an order to fire; and the touch of per­ sonification in Fanon' s figure of the guns "going off by themselves" resem­ bles the tropes Flaubert scatters in his account of the February events:  " [T]he insurrection organized itself powerfully, as if it were directed by a  single hand" (L'Education, 285 I 286 ); "of itself, without upheaval, the mon­ archy was melting in a rapid dissolution" (286 / 286). The point is not that  revolutions do not have causes; it is rather that as events they exceed causal  explanation. As Fram;ois Furet remarks of another, more revolutionary  revolution, " [T]he mere fact that the [French] Revolution had causes does  not mean that they are all there is to its history. . . .  [T]he revolutionary  event, from the very outset, totally transformed the existing situation and  created a new mode of historical action that was not intrinsically a part of  that situation." 45 Revolution, seemingly the moment in which history offers  itself to experience, is in fact the moment of a rupture irreducible to  causality or intentionality. If we understand literariness as a term for such  constitutive moments of rupture, we arrive at the seeming paradox that  history is literary history. The ideological or fetishistic recuperation of his­ tory in turn becomes understandable as the obsession with plot which  Furet ascribes to "revolutionary consciousness" (53), and which Flaubert  deploys as the literary conventions of the Balzacian novel.  We may observe in conclusion that to say that history is "literary" in this  sense is to say that it is always potentially revolutionary. A certain sense of  loss or wreckage clings to such insights: one thinks of Benjamin's assertion  that allegory writes history "on the countenance of nature in the characters  44.

Furet also comments that "[t]he Revolution is the gap that  opened between the language of the Cahiers [de doleances, the list of grievances submitted to  Louis XVI] and that of [Marat's) Ami du peuple in the space of only a few months [in 1789)" (46).  </page> <page sequence="30"> 200 Phantom Formations  of transience," and in the form of "ruin" and "irresistible decay."46 But the  loss which allegory mourns as history is not reducible to pathos. It bears a  greater affinity to the "unanticipatable alterity" which Jacques Derrida af­ firms as the "democratic promise" of communism, for instance, than it does  to the kinds of pain we are able to integrate as subjectivity or process as  aesthetic pleasure.47 Flaubert is not the sort of author one would normally  want to think of as engage; nor is L'Education sentimentale a text that offers  much in the way of purchase for even the most nuanced utopianism. Yet  this text's-and this author's-uncompromising literary vocation bears a  curious similarity to the "rumeur continue" of the crowd which renders  Frederic fatigued and dizzy (100/ 75); and perhaps, if one bends one's ear  far enough, it will become possible to hear in that impersonal murmur an  affirmation of the event-always, necessarily, the revolutionary event-of  the other: an affirmation indistinguishable from a loss which the phallo­ centric and aesthetic negativity of Bildung can only record and mourn with­ out knowing it. If one were to win that interpretative gamble it would  become possible to say that, in telling the story of the Bildungsroman's ruin,  Flaubert novelizes, betrays, and commemorates the irreplaceable alterity of  the other as the apparition of love.  46.

Though the melancholia Benjamin ascribes to allegory does not match the  tone of Flauberfs denatured prose, Benjamin's formulations otherwise address the landscapes  Flaubert constructs in the Fontainebleau episode; e.g. :  " [I]n allegory the observer is confronted  with the facies hippocratica of history as a petrified, primordial landscape" (166).  47. Derrida, Spectres de Marx, 111 .  In the context of a reading of L'Education sentimentale it is  interesting to note the similarity between Marx's description of the non-revolution of 1848  ("when only the ghost [Gespenst] of the old revolution walked about [ging um]" [Eighteenth  Brumaire, 17]) and Marx and Engels's famous claim that " [a] specter [Gespenst] walks about  [geht um] in Europe-the specter of communism" (Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Manifest  der Kommunistischen Partei," in Werke, 4: 461 ). See Derrida, Spectres de Marx, for a study of the  complex temporality and wide figurative range of the specter in Marx's writings.

From this perspective it is possible to read  Flauberfs comment that "the crowd has never pleased me except during the days of riof' as  more than throwaway cynicism or misanthropic conservatism-attitudes Flaubert was obvi­ ously capable of striking both in his writing and his life, particularly the latter. See Flaubert to  Louise Colet, 31 March 1853, in Correspondance, 1850-1859 (Paris: Club de l'Honnete Homme,  1971-75), 8:320.  </page> </plain_text>
