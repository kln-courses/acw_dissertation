<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANNIVERSARY ADDRESS. By E. W. BRABROOK, President. I HAVE now the holnour, for the third and last tilmie, of delivering the custolmiary annual address from the chair. I acknowledge with gratitude the conmpliment you have paid me in prololnging my tenure of office beyond the usual limit, and the many other miarks of kindness alnd sympathy you have shown me during these three years, which have been eventful years for me ini many ways. I ask your leave to offer iny respectful congratulations on the fact that you are about, in accordaince with the unanimous reconmmiiendation of your Council, to elect in my place miiy valued friend, Mr. Rudler. His official connection with the Ethlnological Society com- menced in the year 1870, and frolmi that time to the present his wise counsels, his active ernergies, his wide and deep resources of knowledge, have been freely given to the benefit of this Institute. In the year 1875 it was my good fortune to serve with hiui in the office of Director, in which office lhe succeeded miie ill the year 1881. He held it until 1890, wheni he becamiie Vice-President. I hope alnd most entirely believe that increasing usefulness and prosperity will be the record of the Institute while he occupies the chair. In respect to alnother office, also, a change takes place to- night. Mr. 0. M. Dalton, wholmi we so colnfidelitly recommiiiiended to you two years ago, when Mr. Cuthbert Peek retired from the office of Secretary, lias found that the ilnerease in the weight of official duty incumbent upon himi at the Britislh Museum will prevent hlis continuililg to give us his valuable services. It will be fresli in the recollectioli of all liow well and successfully Mr. Dalton has carried out tLe arrangeiiments for the</page><page sequence="2">President's Address. 547 eveniing meetings during the last two years; and the excellent issues of our Jourlnal under his editorship speak for themselves. Though he took office under the disadvantages of having only recently joined the Institute, and of following a Secretary so exceptionally equipped for the work as Mr. Peek, his ability and devotion have triumphed over all difficulties, and I am sure every member of the Council agrees with me in the expression of our deep gratitude to him for his services. This Institute has, indeed, never yet failed to find good men to carry on its work, and it is a great satisfaction to us that Mr. T. V. Holmes, who has served on the Council for eleven years, has kindly consented to accept the office of Secretary. I cannot refrain from adding that the Council has been fortunate during the past year in having the services as Assistant Secretary of a genltleman so well qualified for that office as Mr. J. Aplin Webster. I now proceed to the usual review of the papers read before you during the year, the interest and variety of which confirm all I have said as to the excellent management of the meetings by Mr. Dalton. Several of these papers belong to the department of Pllysical Anthropology; buit as they are local in character, it will be con- venient to consider them in connectioni with tlle continelits to which they belong. In the department of prehistoric archTeology, we had a paper by our Treasurer Mr. Lewis, who deduiced, from a careful analysis of the measurements of the alncient rmionuments at Stanton Drew and at Merivale near Dartmoor, a series of numerical relations depending uponl various significant numbers, which correspond in a remarkable manlner with similar relatiolns derived from the measurement of the ruins of Zimbabwe in Mashonalanid. In the department of Sociology, Dr. Colley March con- tributed a comprehensive inquiry into the myths which have grown up round the idea of a special degree of wisdom possessed by birds, a conception, which he traced to the ancielnt</page><page sequence="3">548 President's Address. Egyptians, and which is the commoni traditiolnal property of many different races, andc may even be said to suirvive to our own time in certain forms of religious iconography. Mr. Holmes disposed in a conclusive manner of the evidence for the efficacy of the diviner and his rod in the search for water. On the Ethnography of Europe we had lnumerous papers. To begin with our own country:-Mr. A. W. Moore anid Dr. Beddoe investigated the physical anithropology of the Isle of MHan, as disclosed by a record of the characteristics of 1,112 miien enrolled in the riegiment of Royal Manx Fencibles, between 1803 and 1810, and compared them with tlle evidence collected by Dr. Beddoe 80 years later, confirming, his coni- clusion that the population of that islalnd, both in tlhe north) and the south, is Scandio-Gaelic. Mr. Holmes drew our attention to a curious relic of border life in Scotlanid, nl a box used more than half a century ago for the smugglilng of whiskey, when that commodity was taxed more heavily ill EEngland than in Scotlancl. Dr. Beddoe favoured us with another communication of great suiggestive value, in w hielh he showed that differences of complexion were traceable irt Ireland according as the subject bore an indigenlous or an exotic surname-the index of nigrescenice being much lower in those wlho bear surnames indicating a mixture of racee than in those who bear the ancient Irish tribal namnes. Our much esteemed colleague, Dr. Topinard, of Paris, was so oblig,ing as to communicate throuah Dr. Garson, the novel impressions derived by him from an observation of the peoples of Brittan-y, on a recent fourth visit to that part. He poinlted out that the anthropology of Brittaniy and that of Britaini touch in two points-t1hat the special characters of neo- lithic man ancd of tlle men of the Bronze Age respectively correspond in botl ; and that the historic race which settled in Wales and Cornwall emigrated in large numbers into Armorica. He fouLnld two general types in Brittany: A, of rnedium size, long squar e and flat featuLres; B, short in stature, with relatively slhort anid round facial aspect, becominga ti-</page><page sequence="4">Pr--esident's Addr-ess. 549 angular in the lower parts. The general proportions of A are a large head, rather short neck, rather large and square shoulders, a hiigh trunk, moderately short strong anid coarse members, larg,e extremiiities; both in face and body not a beautiful type. B, oni the contrary, has a small head, fine features, lively and expressive eyes, anl agreeable aud supple form ancl small extremities, and is a pleasino type. He dis- tingauished also two special types of more rare occurrence: C, a tall, blonde population, known on the northern and wvestern coasts as the English type, anid D, which occurs among the Bigoudens of Pont l'Abbe, who resemble the people of Auvergne. He lholds that type A is a combinationl of C and D, andl compliments us by deriving its more uinfavourable features from D:-while he traces type B to the autochtho- nious race of the neolithic or, as he puts it, pourl dire tom1te sa )ense'e, of the paleolithic age-a suggestioll which possesses the greatest possible interest for those among us who think that colntinuity is the key to many anthropological problems. For this reason, andl also because of the weight which attaches to the communication as coming, from Dr. Topillard, and the circumstance that it appears in our Journal in the original French, I have been tempted to refer to this paper at greater lengtll than to others. Two valuable contributions by Mr. Myres deal with copper and bronze in Cyprus and South East Euirope; and with an early clay vessel from Amorgos, bearing a, textile impression. On the Ethnography of Asia we received frolm Miss Godden the completion of her inost able monograph of the information we possess as to the Naiga' and other frontier tribes of North Inidia. We were also favoured by Sir George Robertson witn a paper in the felicitous fornm of the narrative of the life history of olne of time Kafirs on IKafiristan and its people, who inhabit that border country ill the far North East of our dominion which is closely related to the present scelle of lhostilities there. Her Highlness the Rallee of Sarawak, Lady Brooke, supplied us with some effective photooraphs taken by herself repre-</page><page sequence="5">550 President's Addtress. senting the native races under her husbalnd's rule, which were commented upon by Dr. Garson. At our last meeting Dr. Landis communicated a paper on the Capping ceremony of Corea. On the Ethnography of Africa, Mr. W. B. Harris read a paper on the Berbers of Morocco, a people "who have held themiiselves aloof fronm Arab and European alike, and whose wild country has been visited so seldom that the explorers who have reached any portion of it can be counted oni the fingers of one's hands." Mr. Seton-Karr recounted his discovery of the lost flint mines of Egypt in the eastern desert anid his further discoveries of ancient Stone Implements in Somalilanid, which now constitute an accumulation of evidence of thte exist- ence there of palheolithic mrian. Mr. H. C. Angus recorded hlis observations on the customs and superstitions of the people of Azimba and Chipitalalnd, dLurilng a year spent in travelling among them. Mr. Read and Mr. Dalton exhibited a marvellous collec- tion of objects of art from Benin, since acquired for the British Museum. Mr. F. Shrubsall contributed a paper on the Crania of African bush races, in which he establishes the distinctions between the Bushmen proper, the Hottentots, and the surround- ing black races, by a series of careful measurements of skulls existinig in various collections in England. In relation to the Ethnography of America, we held, on the courteous invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Maudslay, a meeting at South Kelnsington Museum, where we inspected the magnificent collection of casts of the Maya Monuments and inscriptions made by Mr. Maudslay in Central America, and received from him a most lucid explanation of their meaning. Miss Fletcher gave us a paper on the significance of the scalp-lock. Mr. Joseph Numa Rat, of St. Kitts, contributed a paper on the Carib language as now spoken in Dominica, in the West Indies. On the Ethnography of Australasia, we have also had a number of valuable communications. Mr. R. H. Mathews described and illustrated the various forms of Bullroarers used</page><page sequence="6">President's, Addlrss. 551 by the Auistraliani aborigines and also contributed a further instalment of his description of their rock paintings and carvings. Mr. Duckworth, of Jesus College, Cambridge, con- tributed (through Professor Macalister) the measurements of three skulls of male aboriginial Australians, which deyiate but little from the averages deduced from the larger collection of observations whiclh we owed to the kindness of the same gentle- man in 1894. The Rev. Dr. James Chalmers furnished two papers-one on the Toaripi or Motumotui tribe, situated in the Gulf of Papua in Freshwater Bay, on the coast of New Guiinea; and the other a valuable collection of anthropometric observa- tion on natives of that Gulf, belonging to four different tribes. At a recent meeting we admired andl discussed a splendid exhibit of remains from Rarotonga, by Mr. Moss; Mr. J. S. Gardiner contributed a paper on Rotumah; and we have finally to acknowledge a most interesting communication by Graf v. Pfeil on Duk-duk and other customs as forms of expression of the Melanesian's intellectual life. In the department of Linguistics, besides some papers already mentioned, we have been favoured with a collection of songs and specimens of the language of New Georgia, Solomon Islands, by Lieut. B. T. Somerville, R.N., to which Mr. Sidney H. Ray added an introductory notice of Melanesian and New Guinea songs. We have also published vocabularies of the Bugilai and Tagota dialects of British New Guinea contributed by Dr. James Chalmers, to which Mr. Ray has added a note on the Western Papuan dialects; and a series of aboriginal vocabularies of North-West Australia collected by Mr. E. B. Rigby, also annotated by Mr. Ray. These valuable comniuni- catiolis appear in the Anthropological Miscellanea in our Journal, a department of our work which has been coniducted by our Secretary, Mr. Dalton, in the most admirable manner. I pass on to the record of our losses by death during the year. That of Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks, great as it is,- I need not now refer to at length, the brief and inadequate observations which I made on it at the time having already</page><page sequence="7">552 President's Address. appeared in the Journal. I will miierely place on record the facts that he joined the Ethnological Society in 1863, was elected a member of its Council in 1865, and becamie a Vice- President of this Institute in 1874. For a long time he regularly attended our meetings, took an active part in the pro- ceedings, and made a great number of communications to ouir Journal. His primary allegiance was due, however, to the Society of Antiquaries, which he had joined on the 15th December, 1853, anld in which for many years he played a most distinguished part. His first contribution to "Archaeologia" vas made on the very day he became a Fellow, under the tit,le, Observations on an Ancient Fibula." Sir A. W. Franks died at an advanced aae after a lonig and brilliant career. In the death of Mr. J. Theodore Bent, the Institute has to deplore the early terminationi of a life of remark- able achievement and high promise. An intrepid explorer and a ripe scholar, Mr. Bent was also a man of singularly attractive and engaagiiig character. His first communication to this Insti- tute was in May, 1884, when he described the prehistoric remains of Antiparos and exhibited a large and interesting collection of antiquities brought by himi from that island. In the next following year he reacl a paper on Insular Greek customs; and[ Mrs. Bent, his devoted wife and the comrade in his researches, exhibited ancl described a number of dresses and otlher objects from the Greek islands collected during three winters. In 1890 he read two papers, respectively oni the Ansairee and the Yourouks, of Asia Minor. In 1892 he conmmunicated to us his wonderfll. finds at the Great Zimbabwe ruins, and discussed tlhem witl a view to elucidating the origin of the race that built them. After that, he pursued his researches in the sacred city of the Ethiopians, and puLiblished a valuable work on that subject, as a sequel to his book onl the "Ruined Cities of Mashona- land." In 1895 he recounted to us his visits to the Hadramaut and IDhofar, the frankincense and myrrh countries of South Arabia, with a description of the Bedouins of both districts and their different characteristics. lie nmay be said, indeed, to be</page><page sequence="8">President's Add?ress. 503 olle of the martyrs of science, his death having resulted from malarial fever caught in Africa. Mrs. Bent was, at the time, herself suffering from the same cause. In answering the letter which I was desired by the Council to write, expressing our sorrow and sympathy and our hopes for her speedy recovery, she was so kind as to say that, when well enough, she would look through Mr. Bent's papers and her own memoranda, and communicate to this Institute anything she might find that would interest us. We are now looking forward to the early fulfilment of this gracious and kindly promise. Mr. Charles Harrison, M.P., whose sudden illness and death after attending the funeral of Sir Frank Lockwood are so much to be regretted, joined our ranks in 1869. The interest he took in our pursuits was especially marked by his having published, at his own expelnse, a fine selection of photographs of ethno- graphical objects from the collections in the British Museum, some of which he occasionally exhibited before us. The venerable Mr. James Heywood, F.R.S., formerly M.P., had belonged to our body ever since the year 1844. I am not able to trace any communication by him in our proceedings, but I recollect that he took an active part in the work of the Anthropometric Committee of the British Association, of which 1he was a member. Rear-Admiral Tremlett, who had reached his eighty-second year, died on the 5th April. His naval career commenced in the year 1830, and was one of distinction. It had been his custom for many years to spend some weeks in Brittany, and he became an admitted authority on the rude stone monuments of that country. He was always pleased to supply enquirers with copies of books, plans, and illustrations relating to themn. On several occasions he read papers on that subject to this Institute, anid he was a contributor to various archaeological publications. The recent announcement of the death of Dr. Charles Carter Blake carries our memory back to the early days of the Anthro- pological Society, of which he and our colleague, Mr. J. F. 2 o</page><page sequence="9">f 54 President's Address. Collingwood, were the first Honorary Secretaries. He was a pupil and assistant of Sir Richard Owen, who had a high opinion of his qualifications, and contributed a Preface to his " Zoology for Students." His accomplishments as a craniologist and his skill as a debater are testified by many entries in our early records, and it is a regret to us all that the great promise he held forth of a distinguished career should have been clouded over by illness and misfortune in his later days. Foremost among the matters that have occupied our attention during the year has been the question, to which I referred in my last address-of the establishmnent of an ethnographic bureau. At the annual meeting you resolved, on the motion of Mr. Gomme, that the Council take steps during the year to find the best means of forming such a bureau and obtaining for it the support of Government. The Council, in compliance with this resolution, appointed a Committee for the purpose; and that Committee had the satisfaction of finiding that the British Association was already miioving in the matter. The Council has kept in touch with the proceedings of that Association in this business, tlhrough the kind offices of Sir John Evans as intermediary, who is not only a past President of this Institute, but the actual President of the Association and one of the Trustees of the British Museum. We have every reason to hope that the Trustees of the British Museumii will not be unwilling to accept the function of administrators of the bureau, and will urge upon the Government the pro- priety of making suitable provision for its establishment and maintenance. The Council of this Institute will not fail to do all that can be done to promote the successful issue of these negotiations. As this Institute is much concerned in the position held by Anthropology in the general meetings and at the Council board of the British Associatioln, I may be permitted to allude to the proceedings of the pleasant and memorable meeting held at Toronto in August, where Anthropology, especially in that branch of it which deals with Archeeology, was honoured</page><page sequence="10">Presidenrt's Address; 555 in the person of the President, Sir John Evans. As he miiost truly said, his " principal efforts have now for many years been directed towards attempting to forge those links in the hiistory of the world, anid especially of humanity, that connect the past with the present, and towards tracing that course of evolution which plays as important a part in the physical and moral development of man as it does in that of the animal and vegetable creation." In his address he brought under review the state of our present knowledge with regard to the antiquity of man, anid remarked, " Is not this a case in which the imagination may be fairly invoked in aid of Science? May we not picture to ourselves our earliest ancestors in Eastern Asia, in a tropical climate, with the means of sub- sistence ready at hand, gradually developing from a lowly origin, acquiring a taste for hunting, if not indeed being driven to protect themselves from the beasts around them, and evolv- ing the more complicated forms of tools or weapons from the simpler flakes that had previously served them as knives ? If, when the stage of civilization denoted by these Palaeolithic implements had been reached, game should become scarcer, and the hunter's life assume a more nomad character, may not a series of migrations naturally have ensued which, following the usual course of 'westward towards the setting sun' might eventually lead to a Palaeolithic population finding its way to the extreme borders of Westerni Europe ? " A pleasant incident in the voyage of the " Parisian " steamer, Nvhich carried many of the party to Canada, was the collection by Professor A. Macalister of anthropometric observations on the passengers. As measurements of a special group of indi- viduals, these should be interesting, and I hope will be commu- nicated to us at an early meeting. The Anthropological Section was presided over by Sir William Turner, whose address, by way of distinction from those discourses in which the links uniting man to the lower animals have been dwelt upon, emphasised the specially human characters of mankind. The section was favoured by the 2 o 2</page><page sequence="11">056 President's Address. presenice of m-lan-y anthropologists from Canada alnd the Uliited States, among whonm Dr. Dawson of Toronto, and Professors McGee of Washington and Putnam of New York, took an active part as sectional Vice-Presidents. Miss Alice Fletcher, President of the Anthropological Section of the American Association, also attelnded the meeting and read several papers derived from her personal observation of the beliefs and practices of the Omaha and other Indian tribes. A distinctively Ameri- caiiist tone was given to the proceedings of the section, which were terminated by a spirited discussion of the question of the Trenton implements and other finds in America alleged to be palaeolithic. The report of the Ethuographic Survey Committee, upon which this Institute is directly represented, contains the com- pletion of the typical collection of seven hundred and thirty- three observatiolns of Scottish folk-lore made by the lamented Dr. Walter Gregor, and an abstract of the physical measurements taken by him. The Cambridge sub-committee reports the progress made in its survey of East Anglia; and other collec- tions of anthropometric measurements are furnished from Cleckheaton in Yorkshire, Aberdeen, Baniffshire, and the Island of Lewis. The sub-committee for Ireland is also proceeding with the work, the results of which are published by the Royal Irish Academy. An important Committee has been appointed for the Ethnographic survey of the Dominion of Canada, with which Mr. lartland, Professor -Haddon anid I have been re- quested to co-operate as British members. The Chairman of that Committee is Dr. G. Dawson, now an honorary Fellow of this Institute. We all most heartily wish good speed and great success to Professor Haddoli in his expedition to Papua in the interests of geographical, anthropolooical, and zoological science. I understalnd that he hopes before he leaves England, which will be in a few weeks' time, to be able to issue a book on the study of man, with especial reference to practical ethnographic work -a publication to which we shall look forward with great</page><page sequence="12">President's Acddrebs. o57 interest, alnd which I have no doubt we shall tild exceedingly useful. Before leaving this subject, you will perhaps permit me to add that, as the Council of the British Association has paid the Institute and myself the compliment of nominating me to preside over Section H at Bristol, I shall hope to be supported by your presence there and by the contribution of papers from as many Fellows of the Institute as possible. I have also had the honour to be appointed by the Bibliotheque Nationale of France one of the jury to advise on the quadrennial competition for the Angrand prize of 5,000 fr. I mentioned just now the election of Dr. Dawson of Canada as one of our honorary Fellows. We have likewise added to that distinguished list the names of Professor Sergi of Rome and Sefior Troncoso of Mexico. We have taken part in the proceedings for establishing an International Catalogue of Scientific Literature. Mr. Francis Galton has prepared for the Committee of the Royal Society which is enigaged upon that work, a syllabus of Anthropology, which is appended to this address, alnd two representatives of the Institute (one of them Professor E. B. Tylor) form part of the National Committee for consulting with the Royal Society Committee as to the method of organising the Catalogue in this country upon the scheme they are elaborating. This important undertaking involves the cataloguing of all scieiitific literature upon a uniform system in all parts of the world, and is one which this Institute will watch with great interest and do all that -may be in its power to promote. The occurrence in a recent number of the "Archamological Journal " of a paper on Some Social Coptic Customs, by Marcus Simaika Bey, a gentleman belonging to one of the old conserva- tive Coptic families, who writes from personal familiarity with customs, some of which can be traced to remote periods of ancient Egyptian history, leads to the observation that the proceedings of Societies dealing with various phases of An- thropology freqijently overlap. Though this paper woulcl hiave</page><page sequence="13">558 President's Address. been equally appropriate to our own meetings or to those of tlhe Folk Lore Society; I do not grudge to so eminent and learned a Society as the Royal Archaeological Institute an occasional excursion into alncient Sociology; but I confess that I continue to regret the dissipation of energy caused by the con- tinuance apart of two bodies which have so much in commoln as the Folk Lore Society and this Inlstitute. My well-meant endeavour, a few years ago, to brinig them together failed very signally. I am not without hope, however, in the interests of science and of economy, that it may some day be renewed by more capable hands, and with better prospects of success. I must not pass without notice some recently-published con- tributions to anthropological literature. We have to coingratu- late Sir John Evans on the completioni of a newv edition of his classical work on " Ancient Stonie Implements." The new material it contains, derived from the more recent discoveries, is discussed with the caution and reserve, which we know to be characteristic of our distinguished colleague, and which we recognise as ground for absolute confidenace in him when he formulates a definite conclusion. The work in its revised form will remain, as it always lhas been, the principal authority on the subject with which it deals. Miss Mary H. Kingsley's (lelightful work describing her Travels in West Africa is full of anthropological information. I may briefly summarize her description of the Bubis of Fernando Po. Unlike natives of other parts, they go osteni- tatiously unielothed, but wear a plaster of tola pomatum over the body, and a hat of plaited palm leaf, much adorned with birds' plumes, stick a piece of wood through the lobe of the ear, and hang a string of jujus round the neck. They also wear armlets and leglets of twisted grass, and girdles made of pieces of shell, which form their currency. Their houses are of two classes-houses of assembly and private living houses-the latter very small. They hunt chiefly with traps. They culti- vate yams, koko, and plantains. They are physically a well- formed race, aid their language is of a Bantu stock. They</page><page sequence="14">Presiden,t's Addr-ess. 559 make stone implements and use wooden spears. Their pottery is very rude, but their basket work is good. They use a peculiar form of musical instrument, mlade like a bow, with a tense string of fibre. One end of the bow is placed against the mouth, and the string struck with a stick and scraped with a shell. I have not yet had the opportunity of reading the recently- published work of Mr. Grant Allen on the " Evolution of the Idea of God," and I am not therefore prepared to offer an opinion either on the method of the author's research or the nature of the conclusions at which he arrives; but I mention it in this connection because it appears to ine to deal with a subject that is eminently one for anthropological enquiry. All our notions of the Divine Being are so essentially anthropomorphic-so necessarily derived fromn otur own consciousness and limited by the limitation of our faculties-that the origin and developmlent of the idea is a legitimate and fruitful subject for scientific investigation. That such a subject ought to be treated in a reverent spirit, and in such a manner as to avoid giving offence or shocking those feelings and sentiments which are esteemed to be precious by the great majority of mankind, goes without saying. I am much inclined to believe that the religious senti- ment is as essential anid natural a part of the constitution of maian as any physical or mental. character that he possesses- that it has been implanted in him by the Creator in the same manner, anid passed through the same processes of evolutionary development. In this respect, as in every other, the order of the universe is expressed in continuity and not in cataclysm. In the present day every scientific society must be deeply interested in the popularising, or, as our French friends say, the vulgarisation of its pursuits. From this point of view I would call attention to a most attractive volume by our member the Rev. T. J. Hutchinson, on "Marriage Customs," which cannot fail to interest its readers in some problems of comnparative sociology. I may also mention that in connection with the Society for the Extension of University Teaching, Mr.</page><page sequence="15">560 President's Address. E. A. Parkyn is delivering a course of ten lectures on the Natural History of Man. An admirable series of lectures on the Racial Geography of Europe, delivered by Professor William Z. Ripley, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is being published, with ample illustrations, in " Appleton's Popular Science Monthly." The eleventh lecture of the Series relates to the British Isles. In preparing it, Professor Ripley has made excellent use of the collections nade by the Photograph sub-Committee of the Anithropometric Committee of the British Associatioln, which, by the courtesy of that Association, were entrusted to this Institute for safe custody and for the purposes of study wlhen that Commnittee had completed its labours. It gave me great pleasure to move the Council that these photographs slhould be placed for that purpose at the disposal of Professor Ripley; they most cordially assented to the request, and the result has amply justified them in doing so. If, upon this summary of the year, I take upon myself to assert that the Science of Anthropology and the Anthropo- logical Institute are living, are useful, and are progressive, I shall not fear contradiction, for the facts are all in my favour. I may perhaps be permitted, however, in this my swan-song, to conclude with some observations on the unsolved problems which yet remain and the work which still lies before us. I submit, as postulates, the unity of the anthropological sciences, on which I dwelt in my first address, and the doctrine of continuity, to which I referred in my second address. Much indeed remains to be done before the consequences of these are worked out. The innumerable links in the chain of existence which mark the successive stages of development consequent on the acquisi- tion of the erect posture, indicated in the masterly writings of Dr. Munro-the true history of the apparent break between tte palaeolithic and neolithic periods-the philosophy of the disap- pearance of races-and a hundred other problems relating to physical anthropology-are still unsolved,</page><page sequence="16">President's Address. 561 The origin and development of modes of thoglght, especially in relation to matters of religion and of superstition-in which Mr. Herbert Spencer, Professor Tylor, and Sir John Lubbock have so worthily led the way-are a field for endless specu- lation anld investigation. Finally, the actual observation of man as he exists by means of that essential part of science which consists in measurement, coimbined with the accurate record of his passing mental phases, may well be pushed forward with greater assiduity and perseverance. We study a noble science. Rightly pursued, it may affect the miind of inan more beneficially than possibly any other. It may teach the student to look back to the lhole of the pit whence he was digged:-to look forward to a future that he may contribute to make better and brighter: to look around upon all nature as akin to him, and upon the various races of mankind in the light of the duty that he owes to them :-to look upward to that Creator who first implanted in all nature the faculties that have made man what he now is, aind may mak-e those who are to come after eveln more capable of being useful and being happy.
