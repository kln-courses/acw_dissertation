COOK Scott Theological College, Kenya GOD, TIME AND FREEDOM GOD ETERNAL There seems to be a growing consensus amongst both theologians and philosophers that the classical doctrine of God as a simple, eternal (atemp oral) being is untenable. Worries are expressed about the very notion of atemporal existence and when the examples of numbers and universals are offered, attention is drawn to the uncertain ontological status of such entities. Further, some of the traditional expressions of divine eternity are strictly speaking incoherent, bearing in mind that eternity means having neither temporal location nor duration. For example, it is clearly self-contradictory to assert that atemporal deity enjoys the 'Eternal Now' since this would entail temporal location, and similarly Boethius' famous definition of eternity as 'unending life existing as a complete whole all at once' is suspect, for it suggests that God has both infinite duration ('unending life') and also no duration ('all at once'). Of course, the traditionalist will hasten to point out that God's magnum mysterium is forcing him to employ language analog ically, but the critics suspect they are rather in the presence of the fog of unknowing and just plain woolly thinking. However, the problems really begin for the classical view when an attempt is made to juxtapose eternity with other attributes traditionally ascribed to God. S. Sutherland neatly summarizes these difficulties: A timeless being cannot utter, but neither can he represent to himself. He cannot physically make or create, but neither cani he deliberate, reflect, anticipate or intend, for these are all essentially temporal notions ... He cannot, of course, remember or predict, suspect or confirm; nor is it easy to grasp what timeless love really can be.' Personality involves activity, mental and sometimes physical, but eternity entails immutability and immobility. Far from being omnipotent, it is difficult to fathom how an atemporal God could do anything at all, much less create and sustain a universe. He would be too reminiscent of Keats' bright star 'with eternal lids apart,/Like nature's patient, sleepless eremite', staring at the earth with glazed, mesmeric eyes. Indeed, his omniscience would also seem to be in jeopardy for although he could know that events are temporal and even know their actual temporal order, he could not I S. Sutherland, God, Jesus and Belief (Blackwell, I 984), p. 56.</page><page sequence="2">82 ROBERT R. COOK truthfully use tensed propositions, that is he could not experience time, nor could he know what the present moment is for me. Naturally, classical theists have contested these conclusions, usually by again appealing to the principle of the analogical nature of religious language. E. L. Mascall insists that 'the changelessness that is predicated of a timeless being is very different from the changelessness that would be predicated of a being that existed in time but did not undergo any change', and J. L. Tomkinson informs us, 'The "atemporal" eternity of God is not ... the mere absence or irrelevance of time, but rather a mode of existence less limiting or constricting than the temporal'.2 H. P. Owen argues that there is no formal contradiction in the concept of timeless personhood and therefore the onus falls on the critics to demonstrate their case.3 Yet one senses that these scholars seem in danger of wanting to have their cake and eat it. They appear to be making bold assertions about the nature of God and then when logical deductions of an unwelcome kind are made from these propositions, they extricate themselves by invoking the via negativa and thus make their position inviolable. But the cost is that it becomes by no means clear whether they are saying anything meaningful at all. Let us examine Tomkinson's remark for a moment to see what he actually offers in place of a static deity. He insists that God is not simply beyond time ('not... the mere absence .., of time'), yet he is not bound by time. Now it is certainly a tenable position to hold that God is free from our time dimension. For example, the analogy is sometimes given of the reader and his book. What might take a minute to read may cover fictional action extending over a day or a week. But the important point to realize is that the reader, although not sharing the time dimension of his story, is nonetheless experiencing his own time. Tomkinson's sentence is an accurate description of such a state-of-affairs although he is evidently seeking to describe a middle way between static being and temporality. One may be forgiven for doubting whether there is a middle way. The choice seems to be a simple one between static eternity and various modes of time. If Tomkinson rejects the former, sempiternity (everlastingness) is the only option left to him. Classical theists have also been quick to defend the coherence of the paradoxical notion of an eternal creator. R. Sturch is one such.4 He suggests that for an agent to produce something we mean: (i) the agent wishes the thing to be, and (ii) he has the power and opportunity to execute his wish. Now neither (i) nor (ii) need necessarily involve time, therefore it is intelligible to speak of a timeless act. Regarding creation itself, we need merely to replace (i) with: 'God wishes a world with a temporal beginning 1E. L. Mascall, The Openness of Being (Darton, Longman &amp; Todd, I97I), p. I59. 2 J. L.

Sturch, 'The problem of Divine Eternity', Religious Studies, I0, 1974.</page><page sequence="3">GOD, TIME AND FREEDOM 83 to exist.' This is a clever argument, but there are two things wrong with it. In fact (ii) is implicitly temporal in its implications since the notion of power, even if it is latent power, presupposes the ability to act, and action is necessarily temporal having either temporal location (e.g. a kick of a ball) or duration (e.g. the 'action' of a magnet or battery). Secondly, Sturch fails to provide an exhaustive set of conditions. Imagine courting a girl. I may (i) wish to marry her, (ii) have the power and opportunity to marry her, yet still in fact be unmarried. For the marriage to take place, a third condition needs to be introduced: (iii) take her down the aisle at some specific date. This third condition clearly involves time. Not wishing to compromise divine omniscience, some classical theists have attempted to argue that an eternal God could also experience time. For instance, Tomkinson maintains that a timeless God 'might nevertheless understand and appreciate temporality "as from within" in virtue of the relation of creative causality which he holds to all temporal things'.' But the problem with this is that one imponderable is being explained with reference to another, for to be sustainer God must be sempiternal rather than eternal. This is the difficulty with Aquinas' analogy of the light in the air which is produced by the continual influence of the sun. Aquinas offers this as a picture of how an immutable, eternal being can sustain a temporal universe. And yet to sustain a temporal universe, God must have duration; how can he then be eternal? Meditating this conundrum, N. Pike muses whimsically, 'I wonder if this isn't a little like saying that when Gabriel blows his horn, he does it while holding his breath.'2 Actually, there is evidence that Aquinas himself also believed that a timeless God could experience temporally.3 P. Geach comments, 'How is this possible without a change within God's mind Aquinas does not try to say; the way the eternal mind operates is not fully understandable by US'.4 A less sympathetic Aquinas reader might reasonably suspect him of incoherence. Before his conversion to a sempiternal view of God, R. Swinburne too sought to present a model of an eternal God with temporal experience. He observed how various sentient creatures have different relative time speeds in their subjective experiences. He then suggested that God views our history with infinite velocity so that his experience has no duration. It is therefore timeless.5 However, while avoiding Tomkinson's mistake of implying that God has duration, Swinburne has succumbed to the opposite error of implying that God has temporal location, for even if one allows that infinite velocity is a meaningful concept, it most certainly happens in an instant of time. 1 J L.

COOK It may be concluded that the doctrine of divine eternity does face insuperable problems when it seeks to embrace such fundamental Christian doctrines as God's omnipotence and omniscience, not to mention his full personhood. As J. R. Lucas points out, 'A timeless Deity may be the Truth; it may possibly provide us with the Way, or at least with a Goal; but it cannot ever be the Life. It remains necessarily TO eE1oV not 'o EOs.'1 There have been some valiant recent attempts to avoid this conclusion by the advancement of such ingenious arguments as here reviewed but they fail to convince. It is tempting, therefore, for the Christian theist to espouse the alternative sempiternal doctrine of God found, for example, in Process Theology but Alladin's lesson should be borne in mind: it is not always a wise deal to exchange new lamps for old. GOD SEMPITERNAL A precursor of Process Philosophy is surely Hegel, and it is interesting that nearly one hundred and forty years ago Kierkegaard was already expressing profound misgivings about the notion of an immanent, temporal God: In the world-historical process... God becomes in a fantastic sense the soul in a process. In the world-historical process God is metaphysically imprisoned in a conventional straight-jacket, half metaphysical and half aesthetic-dramatic, that is, immanential system. It must be the very devil to be God in that manner.2 Many today would agree. Mascall, for example, contends that 'a religion of pure immanence places God too close to us to be of any real use. It immerses him in the very predicament in which we ourselves are entangled; it makes him neither our judge nor our saviour.'3 Mascall finds it significant that Whitehead's final attitude to God is not one of adoration so much as sympathy, 'the fellow-sufferer who understands' (one is reminded of T. S. Eliot's lines in 'Preludes':' some infinitely gentle/Infinitely suffering thing'). Such a God is far too anthropomorphic, like the man in the sky lampooned in Honest to God. He is rationally completely inadequate for if the universe cries out for explanation as the Cosmological Argument assumes, so does this contingent deity. A dilemma poses itself. Faith demands a sempiternal God who is personal and who can create, sustain and relate to his creatures, but reason requires an external, immutable deity who makes intelligible this temporal, contin gent universe. However, a carefully argued way forward is offered in K. Ward's Rational Theology and the Creativity of God in which he presents a di-polar picture of a God whose creativity and responsiveness is an ever changing expression of his immutable, eternal nature. 'The eternal is 1 J. R. Lucas, A Treatise on Space and Time (Methuen, I973), p. 30I. 2 S. Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postcript (Princeton University Press, I968; Ist ed. I94), p. I40. 3 E.

" Parting company with classical theists like Augustine and Aquinas, for Ward, 'Time becomes a property of God, rather than something he creates.'2 Like other such innate qualities as omnipotence and goodness, time is not a restriction of God's character. They are his character. They define the kind of being he is. To posit a totally undefined entity with no properties is unintelligible. But the problem of the eternal creating temporal states of affairs has already been noted; is not Ward shifting the problem into the heart of God himself? Is he not saying that God's eternal qualities create or cause his temporal states? Ward replies that 'properties are not causes; only individual agents are '.3 In other words, these properties (which are not unlike Plato's Forms) provide parameters of, for example, rationality and morality within which God's free choices may be made. While obviously owing to a great deal to Process Philosophy, Ward is no slavish adherent. In fact he is a staunch critic 'the cosmic tyrant, against whom Whitehead so strongly protests, has become the cosmic sponge, absorbing all experiences, but contributing nothing except an abstract array of eternal possibilities for the creative multiplicity of the world'.4 Rather Ward has modified Process thought in significant ways to make it more conducive to Christian theism; for example, unlike Whitehead's system, his theology includes a creation ex nihilo, an eschatology and individual immortality. He also has strengthened it philosophically in a couple of areas of major weakness, namely in its tendency to overlook the ramifications of the rejection of absolute time which seems to follow from Relativity Theory, and its rejection of the concept of substance, both human and divine.5 For Ward, God and sentient creatures are beings, not just sets of occasions. But there are other philosophical onslaughts which a modified sempiternal doctrine must contend with. Augustine has not been the only thinker to be bothered by the problem of divine tedium for a consciousness that stretches over aeon upon aeon of time. However, as Swinburne reminds us, 'An omnipotent being could... ensure that his life was not tedious or boring.'6 There are plenty of things an all powerful God could do to keep himself occupied! It should also be borne in mind that subjective time is very elastic such that one is barely aware of its passing when happy and engaged. Advocates of God's eternity have also insisted that to be subject to time is to endure severe limitations as we can tell from our own experience. The future is uncertain and unknown, the present moment which is the only true reality has no dimension, no width, and the past is irretrievable except in 1 K.

Lewis cries out, 'God forbid we should think God was like that. Even we may hope not to be rationed in that way.'1 Yet we must beware of anthropomorphism at this point. Much of our fear of time is linked with the decrepitude it brings and the satiety. To quote T. S. Eliot again, this time from The Four Quartets: ... the cold friction of expiring sense Without enchantment, offering no promise But bitter tastelessness of shadow fruit As bDody and soul begin to fall asunder. Not to mention the remorse 'Of things ill done to others harm/Which once you took for exercise of virtue.' Of course God is confronted by none of these terrors or regrets. Nor is he faced with the misery of nostalgia for experiences or acts of excellence which have passed as we humans are, and this is for two reasons. Firstly, as Swinburne argues,2 an omnipotent deity could recreate qualitatively similar events whenever he chose, although perhaps one should add, there would be a certain restriction if free-will creatures were involved who, by the nature of the case, could not be forced into a 'repeat performance'. Secondly, as Process Philosophers have emphasized, the value of the past can be preserved perfectly in God's infallible memory. Sutherland raises another radical objection at this juncture.3 He doubts whether a sempiternal God could distinguish between present and past at all, since for us the past is distinguishable from the present in that our knowledge of the former is less clear and certain, but for an omniscient deity the past and the present must be equally clear and sure, so it is difficult to see how he could distinguish one from the other, in other words, how the past could be past for God at all. Behind this argument one senses the influence of Hume with his analysis of memories as fainter than impressions but livelier than ideas of the imagination. In reply to Sutherland one might affirm that there is nevertheless something in the quality of a memory, irrespective of its clarity, that distinguishes it from the present. It is significant that when memories were reactivated in a most vivid way during W. Penfield's exposed brain experiments,4 the patients were in no doubt that they were in fact experiencing memories although their recollections were as clear and certain as their present sense experience. There is an indefinable 'familiarity' about a memory which distinguishes it from sense experience or day-dream. An alternative line of reply to Sutherland's challenge is to observe that the discrimination between present and past experience is a matter of their respective relations rather than their varying degrees of clarity; in the series, a memory precedes a sense experience.

See Penfield's article.</page><page sequence="7">GOD, TIME AND FREEDOM 87 exemplifies this approach when he writes, 'It can, I think, plausibly be maintained that the relation of temporal precedence is "given" to us in experience. As a matter of empirical fact, one can see or hear A-following-B, in the same immediate fashion as one can see A-to the left of-B. ' It is, therefore, not impossible to conceive of a sempiternal God with perfect recall still knowing the past as past. The kind of di-polar theism propounded by Ward seems, therefore, to be able to withstand the most pressing philosophical objections and to provide a far more tenable doctrine of God than classical theism ever could. But what can be said about the nature of God's temporal experience? GOD S TIME Regarding the nature of God's experience of time, Ward remains essentially agnostic. But at the very least, he contends, God must be our contemporary so that he can hear and answer prayer and so on. He rejects the Newtonion receptacle view of time in favour of the Einstinian universe where time is no longer an absolute medium within which all cosmic events can be placed relative to each other. Therefore, 'God must exist in a number of different time-sequences, not relatable to each other by relations of absolute simultaneity. '2 In fact, with the Biblical allusion to the 'Heavenly hosts' in mind, Ward speculates that there might be many unrelated times and spaces created by God. He prefers to describe God as 'multi-temporal', rather than just temporal. Actually there is a more straightforward picture of God's temporal awareness available to those philosophers who reject the concept of unrelated times as logically incoherent and those who still maintain, like Lucas and Swinburne, that there is an absolute time. One might postulate an omniscient consciousness moving through absolute time and along the way, vicariously experiencing the various subjective times of different sentient creatures. The subjective time of a gnat might appear to move very fast and that of an elephant very slowly. The subjective time of someone travelling close to the speed of light would also seem to be moving slowly. It would be rather like a man watching a number of videos at the same time, where some films were running slow and some fast. Indeed, one day in the slow films would be like a thousand years, and a thousand years in the fast ones would be like a day (cf. 2 Peter 3: 8). It has already been observed that once one begins doing theism 'from above', that is by presupposing that God must be eternal, immutable, actus purus, simple, it becomes impossible to affirm coherently that he also enjoys temporal experience. The objectively eternal God of classical theism cannot have consecutive subjective experiences. But by doing theism 'from below', 1 A. J. Ayer, The Problem of Knowledge (Pelican, I956), p. I52. 2 K. Ward, op. cit. p. i66.</page><page sequence="8">88 ROBERT R. COOK that is by accepting as the prime datum the fact that God is personal and therefore to some degree temporal, mutable, possessing the potential for change, complex, it becomes possible to describe God's experience as in some sense timeless. An objectively sempiternal deity may have an eternal subjective experience. J. Macquarrie, for instance, wants to assert that God is both above and within time. He offers an analogy, 'I would say myself that the best clue we can have is our own relationship to time - we are in time, yet fundamental to personal being is a capacity to transcend time as mere succession, and perhaps this affords some glimpse of God's double relation to time. " Grace Jantzen has gone on to refine this insight.2 she takes as her cues Bergson's concept of 'duration' (the ability of consciousness to hold together past units of time in an integrated whole e.g. when a whole joke or musical phrase is comprehended) and William James' notion of the 'specious present' which is very similar. She observes that the length of the specious present can vary from a few moments to, if Mozart's testimony is to be believed, the duration of an entire musical composition. She speculates that in God's case, his specious present might encompass the whole of the past. It may be something like this insight that Lucas is reaching towards when he writes, God is the master of events, not their prisoner; time passes, but does not press. All time is present in the divine mind, in the sense that no-one is remote or far away or absent, but not in the sense that all is simultaneous, nor that eternity is a timelessness in which nothing ever happens nor can be conceived of as happening.3 FOREKNOWLEDGE AND HUMAN FREEDOM Advocates of divine sempiternity are virtually unanimous that God cannot, in principle, know the future given that the universe contains free-will beings whose future choices are by definition unpredictable. Nevertheless, they argue that God is omniscient in that he knows all there is to know. In the words of Philip Larkin, 'the past is past and the future neuter' ('If my darling'). Among those denying divine foreknowledge are Pike, Kenny, Swinburne, Geach, Ward and Jantzen. Perhaps here at last is the Achilles heel of the view that God is everlasting. Many Christian theists will find it unsatisfactory for two reasons. Firstly, it may be argued that Scripture contains many prophecies concerning future contingencies (e.g. Peter's denial) and secondly this view gravely threatens the traditional notion of God's sovereignty over the events of history. To be sure, such a God could successfully predict events resultant from the laws of nature; for example, he would be an infallible meteorologist. But so much of history, from revolutions I J.

Would he necessarily know best? Could he be trusted? Many would have their doubts. Must the anxious believer resort, then, to a Calvinistic soft-determinism while holding onto a sempiternal view? Or must he reluctantly resume his belief in an eternal God? After all, a timeless God does not strictly foreknow anything, he just knows, and knowledge of something occurring by no means entails that that which occurs cannot be contingent and autonomous. What God timelessly knows would depend, in part, on what I freely choose. He would infallibly know all my choices without determining them. We must beware of confusing epistemology and metaphysics, as P. Davies reminds us in his discussion of something quite different: the Einstinian notion of the space time continuum. He contends that the free-will/determinism issue is completely separate from the question of whether Einstein was right to postulate a continuum which completely transcends our sense of time. He writes, The physicist views spacetime as laid out like a map, with timc extending along one side. Events are marked as points on the map - some events are linked by causal relations to prior events, others like the decay of a radioactive nucleus, are labelled 'spontaneous'. It's all there, whether the causal links are incorporated or not. So my contention that there is no past, present and future says nothing about freewill or determinism at all.' D. Williams expresses the same point more colourfully in his famous essay, 'The Myth of Passage', 'It makes no difference to our theory whether we are locked in an ice pack of fate, or whirled in a tornado of chance, or are firm-footed makers of destiny'.2 Many a thoughtful theist faces a painful dilemma then, as he seeks to formulate a theology which preserves God's knowledge of our future. The soft-determinist option retains divine sovereignty but raises intractable problems in the area of theodicy. Yet the eternal God option drags with it all the problems outlined in the first section of this article. But, in fact, there is another option. Origen, in the third century, pointed to a possible way forward when he insisted that God's foreknowledge does not cause me to do a thing, rather my doing it causes his past knowledge. In other words, if I shall freely choose to do something, God necessarily knows that I shall do it, which should not be confused with the determinist assertion that if God knows that I shall do that thing, I must necessarily do it. Presumably, this simple solution has not commended itself to most philosophers because it presupposes that an effect can precede its cause and the concept of reverse-causation is considered to be untenable. However, this assumption should be contested. 1 P. Davies, God and the New Physics (Dent, I983), pp. I3I-2. 2 R. M. Gale, ed., The Philosophy of Time (Macmillan, I968), p. II 5.</page><page sequence="10">90 ROBERT R. COOK The concept of reverse-causation has recently received close scrutiny following the provocative article 'Bringing about the past ',' in which M. Dummett argues that it is a coherent notion. The article sparked off a lively debate and there follows a few relevant observations on the topic. The first point is to make a clear distinction between changing or altering the past, and bringing about the past. The former is a logical impossibility for it is analytically true that what has been has been. If it were imagined, it could lead to all sorts of nonsensical scenarios such as the possibility of murdering a little girl who would have become one's own mother. The latter, on the other hand, is not self-evidently unintelligible. The discussion centres on whether an agent can bring about the past as well as bring about the future, for, after all, we are bringing about the future all the time. Secondly, the grounds on which Dummett's thesis has generally been rejected are themselves contestable. For example, Swinburne argues that Dummett's case fails because, in principle, no evidence could finally be adduced to prove that a present event caused a past one.2 But this is to link verification and meaning too closely. There are many perfectly meaningful statements which are, in principle, neither verifiable nor falsifi able (e.g. 'Sometime in the future all sentient life will be annihilated without warning.'). Reverse causation may occur, even if we could never know decisively that it has occurred. Or, to give another example of an objection, Kenny complains that Dummett gives no ground for distinguishing between past and future since both are, according to him, partially undetermined.3 But B. Davies rightly replies 'According to Dummett, we can identify two sets of events, one taking place before the other, and coherently postulate (or at least not demonstrate that it is incoherent to postulate) that the later set causes the earlier one. It thus seems natural to say that Dummett's account already presupposes that we distinguish earlier and later '.4 The third is the more general point that the consensus amongst modern philosophers seems to be that the common assumption that causes must precede effects (or at least be synchronous with them) is largely based on linguistic convention. Reverse causation is not a metaphysical impossibility, it is just empirically highly unlikely. Normally, causal priority operates, but this is a contingent, rather than a logical fact.5 Fourthly, the assumption that the empirical evidence is totally one-sided may be questioned, for in both physics and parapsychology there are candidates for reverse causation. Davies points out that in the New-Physics I R. M. Gale, ed., Ibid. Dummett's article was first published in I964. 2 R. Swinburne, Space and Time (Macmillan, I968), ch. 8. 3 A.

Taylor in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. See also R. M. Chisholm, and R. Taylor, 'Making things to have happened', Analysis, 20, I960; and J. L.

Hypothetical faster-than-light particles (called tachyons) could accomplish this' and 'the quantum theory requires a sort of reversed time causality, inasmuch as an observation performed today can contribute to the con struction of reality in the remote past.'I Then in the realm of parapsychology, there have been some impressive results gained during the past decade which may suggest the veracity of precognition.2 The fifth point is to warn against the error of assuming that a precognizable future entails fatalism. Grace Jantzen seems to fall into this, trap when she writes ' if God " remembered " the future - then the events of the future must be as unchangeable as the past. It is not just difficult, it is logically impossible to change the past; and if the future is just like the past to God then it too is absolutely rigid'.3 But it is an error to assume that the past is closed and the future open. In fact, they are both as open and closed as each other. It is analytically true that what will be will be, as what has been has been. Nevertheless, if determinism is false, neither the past nor the future is explicable in terms of deterministic laws; remember the spacetime map where some events were linked by causal relations while others were labelled spontaneous'. The final point is to show that precognition does not necessarily entail that the future exists now, which many would conclude is an absurd notion. It is a misunderstanding to assume that the concept of the spacetime continuum must involve an ever-existing plane of reality on which our past, present and future can be located. This point is forcefully made in 'The Myth of Passage' where Williams writes, 'Although the theory entails that it is true at every time that events occur at other times, it emphatically does not entail that all events happen at the same time or at every time, or at no time. It does not assert, therefore, that future things "already" exist or exist "forever".'4 It is as false to assume that the past still exists since it can be remembered, as to contend that the future must exist if it is precognized. Memory informs one that what is remembered has happened and similarly precognition would impart knowledge of what will happen. This is the line argued by A. J. Ayer, and he concludes, 'there is no a priori reason why people should not succeed in making true statements about the future in the same spontaneous way as they succeed, but what is called the exercise of memory, in making true statements about the past.

Many a Christian would maintain, on the basis of Special Revelation, that this is exactly what God is like. FOREKNOWLEDGE AND DIVINE FREEDOM But does this view jeopardize divine freedom, given that God would presumably have infallible cognizence of his own future too? One could attempt to circumvent the charge of divine determinism by insisting that the nature of God's precognized future is the result of his prior choices and thus his freedom is retained (just as there is no contradiction in saying that I freely choose that I will definitely attend a lecture tomorrow) but there is the problem that for an everlasting being there can be no first moment at which he makes all his choices for the future which he thereafter foreknows. Freedom does seem problematic for one who has always known all his future. While admitting the weight of the problem, a few remarks are in order. Firstly, it may be held that classical theism also has a problem with divine freedom for two reasons. One, it seems to be incompatible with the notion that God must be actus purus. F. C. Copleston presents Aquinas' dilemma thus: [God] was not compelled by his nature either to create or to create this or that possible world. On the other hand Aquinas was also convinced that the creative act, as it exists in God, is identical with divine nature which is essentially immutable.' Second, it may seem incompatible with the concept of eternity. To quote Ward again: if God could either create a World or not create a World, then there must be a state of God in which he has not yet decided which to do. The doctrine that he eternally (timelessly) and immutably decides in favour of one case is incoherent, for there can be no preceeding state of God in which he decides.2 However, Ward's line of argument is not irrefutable. If it is coherent to postulate timeless knowledge as classical theists claim, it must also be intelligible to maintain that this knowledge could include both necessary elements and free decisions of the agent. It may be helpful to recall, yet again, the atemporal spacetime continuum which contains both determined and 'spontaneous' events. Even in our experience, the making of a decision is not of necessity temporally preceded by a state of indecision. We sometimes make an instantaneous choice based on an immediate intuitive awareness of all the relevant factors. But if it is allowed that a timeless God could be free, it would seem to follow that he could not also be actuspurus for his existence would be a variation on his essence. His essence would provide the parameters for his available choices and his existence would be the result of these choices. I F. C. Copleston, Aquinas (Pelican, I955), p. I39. 2 K. Ward, op. cit. p. 75.</page><page sequence="13">GOD, TIME AND FREEDOM 93 The second remark is to observe that Scripture only, perhaps, implies that God knows now the complete history of this cosmos. He has not necessarily always known this. Perhaps the acquisition of knowledge of all events of this spatiotemporal universe was synchronous with God's creation of it, and this somehow includes all the future acts he purposed he would perform. Before the act of creation he was ignorant of the outcome, while since then, he has known the end from the beginning of this cosmos. Possibly his foreknowledge terminates at the eschaton. He may have purposes concerning 'the new heaven and the new earth' but maybe he cannot precognize either one. He is rather like a playwright watching the first performance of his play, knowing throughout how the plot will unfold, while only having an inkling of what his next play will be about.' But what philosophical rationale can be offered for this view? Certainly the nature and limitations of memory are mysterious enough, much less the possible nature and limitations of precognition. The view is based on what seems to be the sound Roman Catholic conclusion from its sixteenth century debate with Molinism that 'middle knowledge' is an impossibility. There can only be knowledge of an actual contingent world; free events in hypothetical worlds being, in principle, unknowable. Although it has been mentioned that some find the idea of an existing future totally absurd, there are others who interpret Einstein differently. For example P. Davies writes, It is usually presumed, without thinking, that the future is as yet unformed and perhaps undetermined; the past has gone, remembered but relinquished. Past and future, one wishes to believe, do not exist. Only one instant of reality seems to occur 'at a time'. The theory of relativity makes nonsense of such notions. Past, present and future must be equally real, for one person's past is another's present and another's future.2 The third and final remark is to offer a more simple hypothesis which perhaps contains fewer latent problems than the onejust described. This last hypothesis challenges the assumption that freedom is impossible for a being who has always known all his future. Certainly such a being would never be shocked or surprised, but why should he lack freedom? He would always know what he was about to choose but when the time came, he would choose it, for example, because it was morally right, or aesthetically excellent, not because he knew he would choose it. It must be remembered that the model assumes that God's future choices cause his past knowledge, not vice versa. A being like this could not grow in knowledge but he could develop in terms of experience and perhaps emotional enrichment, for as time passed I Of course, this analogy is of limited application because all the decisions of the characters are determined by the author. In her attempt to rescue human autonomy, Dorothy Sayers uses the analogy while focusing on the playwright's delight in watching the sensitive actor struggling to interpret the script in a creative way. She writes, 'Within the limits of this human experience, the playwright has achieved that complex end of man's desire - the creation of a living thing with a mind and will of its own' (The Mind of the Maker, Methuen, I94I, p. 52.) 2 P. Davies, op. cit. p. I24.</page><page sequence="14">94 ROBERT R. COOK knowledge that (the knowledge of anticipation) would become knowledge of (the knowledge of experience). This could be what the writer to the Hebrews was intimating when he suggested that with the incarnation divine sympathy became divine empathy: 'Because [the Son] himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted' (Heb. 2: I8). For those who fear that to postulate any kind of development in God would entail that he must be moving from relative imperfection to perfection, it should be remembered that the same writer teaches that Christ was perfected through suffering (Heb. 2: Io), yet he surely did not mean to imply thatJesus was an imperfect child or adolescent. CONCLUSION This article has been an attempt to develop a philosophically defensible theism which also accords with the traditional Christian doctrine of God's omniscience as including our future as well as our past. This view of God satisfies the requirements of a rational theology and also a Biblical theology. God is 'the high and lofty one who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy' but he is also immanent and intimate, 'I dwell ... with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit' (Isa. 57: 15). He is immutable: 'I the Lord do not change' and yet he has a reciprocal relationship with his creatures: 'Return to me and I will return to you' (Mal. 3: 6f). He it is who challenges the idol gods with the rhetorical question: Who is like me? Let him stand up, let him declare himself and speak and show me his evidence, let him announce beforehand things to come, let him declare what is yet to happen. (Isa. 44: 7)</page></plain_text>
