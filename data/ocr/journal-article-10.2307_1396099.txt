<plain_text><page sequence="1">A viezer Ravitzky RABBI J. B. SOLOVEITCHIK ON HUMAN KNOWLEDGE: BETWEEN MAIMONIDEAN AND NEO-KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY1 I Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, like one of the great Jewish teachers of yore, combines the study of law and of philosophy, halakhah and religious thought. His writings are characterized by the double mark of the par- ticular Jewish sphere of Talmud Torah and the universal human sphere of wisdom. His philosophy, too, focuses upon both domains: on the one hand, upon a portrayal of the dialectic nature of the religious personality and the general human condition; on the other hand, upon an analysis of the conceptual nature of halakhic activity. The philosophy of the religious personality explores the inner vacilla- tions of the believer, the complex dialectical relationships between man and God, the dual character of the religious consciousness. Closeness and distance revelation and concealment, love and fear, freedom and com- pulsion, fulfillment and frustration, dignity and covenant, majesty and humility, conquest and defeat-these and other images express the con- tinuous change and movement, the sharp polarity characterizing the human religious condition. "The man of faith, whose religious experience is fraught with inner conflicts and incongruities, who oscillates between ecstasy in God's companionship and despair when he feels abandoned by God, and who is torn asunder by the heightened contrast between self- appreciation and abnegation."2 Soloveitchik never wearies, in his various essays, of emphasizing the complex and dynamic nature of the religious consciousness-both experience and thought. Furthermore, such inner divisions and movements also define the existential situation of man in general. Firstly, human life reflects a permanent tension between the private, lonely existence of the individual over against his role as a member of the community, between his personal and social gestures. Secondly, within the confines of the collective, com- munal life, there exists a constant vacillation between a social-cultural link based upon shared accomplishments and projects, upon interests and 157</page><page sequence="2">A viezer Ravitzky conquest, and a social-existential link based upon mutual commitment and sacrifice, upon covenant and normative Kerygma. Finally, Rabbi Soloveitchik portrays man's dual approach towards the cosmos, towards nature itself: from conquest to withdrawal, from mastery to self-discipline. Just as man is divided in his stance towards his Creator (the religious gesture), so is he divided in his stance towards his fellow man (the social gesture) and towards nature (the cosmic gesture). It must be emphasized that in none of these are we referring to fluctuations between good and evil, between a value-rooted existence and one bereft of values. We rather focus upon a dynamic relation between various positive norms incumbent upon man, between various dimensions of full human existence. Each pole represents a different positive response to the call addressed to man in the world. However, each response is a limited, 'one-dimensional' aspect of the complete ex- istence, of the ideal human fulfilment:3 man is liable to restrict himself to only one of the different aspects of human existence, rather than to sustain a full and encompassing posture. That is to say: Rabbi Soloveitchik's assertions about the complex and dialectical human identity are not to be understood on the descriptive, phenomenological level, but rather on the prescriptive, normative one.4 The philosophy of the halakhah, on the other hand, examines the par- ticular nature of halakhic activity, its creativity and method. It teaches us how to anchor change and vacillation upon a stable Archimedean point; how to fix the expression of the subjective within a permanent, objective reality. It is intended to establish the right interrelation, the appropriate synthesis, among the different components of the religious personality.5 If the phenomenology of the religious consciousness described the process, the path ascending towards God, the philosophy of halakhah is supposed to set out the ultimate, supreme goal: the renewal of a per- sonality-no longer subjected to temporal change-by means of the ob- jective law, by halakhic contents and norms.6 Following in the wake of a specific Jewish scholarly tradition, Rabbi Soloveitchik interprets the halakhah not merely as a system of practical regulations, not only as a collection of normative instructions directing our activites, but also (or should one say: primarily) as a cognitive system, an entire universe of theoretical concepts: "The halakhah is not a random collection of laws, but a method, an approach, which creates a noetic unity,"7 a coherent logical structure uniting its multiplicity and division, giving it fixity and order. While this ideal system is meant to be imple- mented in concrete reality, its status as such is neither dependent upon this realization nor exhausted by it. The philosopher of the halakhah carries this idea to an extreme: halakhic activity is intended to acquire absolute autonomy, to create its ideal world, one which precedes any other reality-physical, biological, psychological or sociological-and 158</page><page sequence="3">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge which transcends any temporal alterations. The halakhic system is thus protected from any attempt at reduction to another realm. It is open to innovation, to constructive creativity, but these are meant to be conducted by its own internal logic alone, by means of its own unconditional, trans- temporal conceptual system. Thus, the objective realm of the halakhah is supposed to transcend the subjectivity and vacillations of the believer, to anchor it on a fixed focus. In this way only could an autonomous, indi- viduated personality recreate itself-intellect and will-in the image of the divine-Intellect and Will. At this stage, the boundaries between the man of halakhah and the prophet, the man of God, become somewhat obscured;8 they each progress from an imitation of God to a cleaving to Him, they both unite intellectual cognition and revelatory content. "The man of God begins with duality and ends in unity."9 "Halakhic cognition unites the finite with the infinite."10 The supremacy of the halakhah is thus stated in a clear, definitive way.1t The philosophy of the religious personality, of the dialectic human stance in front of God, man and the world, makes use of concepts and theoretical distinctions taken from the modern philosophy of religion, and from modern existentialist philosophy. The philosophy of the hala- khah, while explicating the erudite world of his forebearers to the outside world, borrows concepts and analogies from the world of the exact sciences and neo-Kantian philosophy.12 In both cases, the author turns towards the thought of Maimonides as his immediate source and for his conceptual framework. This paper will trace one important thread in this erudite and complex structure: Soloveitchik's turn from the logos of the cosmos to the logos of the halakhah, from the knowledge of God's action (Creation) to the knowledge of God's word (Sinai). II In his essay, U-viqqaRtem mis-sam ("And you shall seek from there" [Deut. 4:29]), the author portrays the ladder of ascension of the religious per- sonality-from the dialectic movement to the ultimate renewal or re- shaping of the personality-i.e., towards halakhic man. The process begins through human initiative, with an individual who seeks "the reflection of the Creator in His creation," who turns towards "the quest for God through the world."'3 This quest is reflected both in intellectual speculation, in scientific and philosophical reflection, as well as in the longing for direct and unmediated religious experience via the cosmos. From this first step, the process moves to the alternative pole: from the human initiative (both scientific and experiential), from the realm of freedom and spontaneity, towards an opposite stage, towards the awareness of the commanding, transcendent God-i.e., towards the 159</page><page sequence="4">Aviezer Ravitzky cognizance of obedience and submission to the ultimate divine will im- posing itself upon man. In other words: Creation as thesis (science and cosmic experience-awareness of freedom), and Sinai as antithesis (reve- lation and law-awareness of subjugation), take their place as essential moments in the molding of the full Jewish religious consciousness. Finally, at the end of a winding and divided path, described in detail by the author, we are brought to the final and highest synthesis: the unifica- tion of freedom with commandment, of intellect and will, in which "Torah becomes mixed with human individuality."14 The autonomous will be discovered within the heteronomous: "as if the will of the infinite were also the will of finite man-a wondrous identification of the two wills."15 This final synthesis is attributed to the man of halakhah-i.e., to "the man of God [who] begins in duality and concludes with unity."16 This complex portrayal, which reflects the dialectical method of the Hegelian school, in fact illustrates the way by which each of the separate elements of the religious consciousness serves in man's quest for God (experience vs. cognition, will vs. intellect, creativity vs. obedience, etc.). In Soloveitchik's earlier work, Halakhic Man, we found an analysis of the ideal figure of Judaism, a dissection of a unified individual into his various spiritual components ("the man of religion," "the man of knowl- edge," etc.). In his later essay, U-viqqaStem mi-Sam, on the other hand, we discover a synthesis of this ideal figure, its genesis, growth and develop- ment, a gradual unification of its various expressions.17 Halakhic Man has described "pure" human types, different ideal models merging together to mould the man of halakhah; U-viqqastem mis-am, however, describes different cognitive moments, "pure" and theoretical stages, shaping his personal posture. Now, in order to present the final synthesis, the highest cognitive and creative level, in order to "clarify the epistemological-metaphysical basis for the possibility of human communion with God," Rabbi Solo- veitchik turns to Maimonides' teaching concerning the unity of the in- tellect with the object of its intellection, the identity of the knower with the known: "this principle, which was lifted by Maimonides to a remark- able height, and was placed in the center of his world-view, sheds clear light on the nature of clinging to God."'8 No doubt this principle stands in the center of Rabbi Soloveitchik's own thought: the summit of the ladder of personal ascent was depicted-in both of the above essays-in light of this conception. The special usage and bending of this conception in Soloveitchik's thought require study and clarification. In several schools of modern thought-those which place vitality, spontaneity, immediate experience and intuition at the center of their concerns-intellectual cognition is depicted as an alienating activity, separating man from the world, creating a gap between man and being. In his original, native condition, the human creature lives in a state of 160</page><page sequence="5">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge continuous harmony with nature, experiencing an unmediated relation to being; he does not stand vis-a-vis reality, but with it and in its midst. But with the rise of consciousness and conceptual abstraction, man is torn away from this primary state of being and from his real place within the world. Reality becomes an external object of contemplation, standing over and against him, confronting him, and from thence forward there exists a division of spheres-a knowing subject on the one hand, and a known object on the other: the "I" stands before the "not-I." Thus man becomes estranged both from the universe and from himself. These trends in philosophy, which protest against the rule of the rational and the ob- jective, see conceptualized consciousness, as opposed to immediate ex- perience, as an activity destroying man's concrete grasp upon reality. On the other hand, the Aristotelian-Maimonidean philosopher grants intellectual cognition a unifying power to overcome the division between subject and object. Only in the pre-cognitive stage, prior to the acquisition of knowledge, is there a duality between man and every object outside of himself, a separation between man and the unknown essence (between "the intellect in potential" and the "intelligible in potential"). However, once the process of cognition is realized, once knowledge in actu is ac- quired, human intellect no longer exists apart from its apprehensions and knowledge, separate from the truths acquired. The intellect in ac- tuality is none other than the objects of its cognition, the very content of its knowledge. Man's intellectual identity is built in stages, via the process of study, a gradual process by which the "external" becomes "internal": "The thing that is intellectually cognized is the abstract form . . . this form is identical with the intellect realized in actu" (Guide I: 68). Thus, it is precisely abstract knowledge which constructs a bridge between man and being, between consciousness and world, as true encounter is only possible with the essential, with the form separate of matter, with the inherent reason of the cosmos. It is precisely in the intellectual act that the subject and the object become one: "the intellect in actu is nothing but that which has been intellectually cognized"; "for the true reality and the quiddity of the intellect is apprehension" (Ibid.). To paraphrase in our own language: the acquisition of knowledge is a gradual process of the unification of the self with the logos of the world, with its rational lawful- ness, with the essence of every entity; cognition is a process of"internali- zation" of the intelligibles. There is no unity with matter, but rather with form; with essence, not with mere existence; through apprehension, not through immediate experience. The rational element is the substan- tial one. Maimonides took this idea beyond the Aristotelian texts available to him,19 drawing a direct parallel between the unity of subject and object existing in human cognition, and that existing in Divine cognition. True, the unity of the human knower with the object known is always partial 161</page><page sequence="6">Aviezer Ravitzky and fragmented, while the unity of the Divine knower and the object known is continuous and all-encompassing. True, human knowledge is attained step by step; it is derived from the objects, through a gradual process of development and perfection, while the Divine apprehension exists whole and continuous in actu, transcending process and time. How- ever, the nature of the cognitive act remains one and the same-a unifica- tion of subject and object, knower and known: "the unity of the intellect, the intellectually cognizing subject, and the intellectually cognized object, does not hold good with reference to the Creator only, but also with reference to every intellect" (Ibid.). What is the real significance of this analogy? How far is this to be taken? According to a minimalist interpretation, Maimonides only refers here to a formal parallel between the Creator's act of knowledge and that of the creature, and not to one pertaining to the very contents of their apprehension. There is a common structural ground to every cognitive act, divine or human, but not necessarily a common object, a common substance. Cognition as such, whether finite or infinite, whatever its object, is based upon the union of the knower with the known. However, according to Rabbi Soloveitchik's maximalist interpretation, there exists also a material similarity,20 whose implications are profound: human knowledge reflects upon the same object as does the Divine-namely, upon the universe, Nature, Creation. The parallelism between the finite and infinite act of knowledge should be applied not only in relation to the structure of the cognitive act, but also in relation to the very contents of knowledge. "The world is the object of both divine cognition and of man's one-a wondrous conclusion."21 And now to the final step: the Creator knows His world and this implies a unity of subject and object. Man knows God's world, and this implies a unity of subject and object. It follows that Creator and creature are united via their common object of knowledge-the cosmos. "Man and God are united in their cognition of the world"; "Via the world man clings to God, because the existence of the world is rooted in God's thought-the absolute true thought."22 That is to say: finite human cognition is entirely contained within the infinite Divine one. There is only one truth; thus, there can be no partial (human) knowledge of the truth if it does not partake of the complete, ultimate one. The material parallel between God's and man's knowledge was drawn to its final logical conclusion: a true human apprehension is nothing but "an infinitesimal participation in the infinite apprehen- sion of God";23 "finite apprehension does not exist, nor can man know, except via the infinite apprehension."24 Rabbi Soloveitchik's interpretation of Maimonides' theory would appear to reflect the influence of Solomon Maimon (1753/54-1800), the neo-Kantian philosopher and Maimonidean exegete. Maimon's phi- losophy rooted and made the human intellect dependent upon the idea 162</page><page sequence="7">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge of an infinite divine intellect: "human reason and its activity are only possible on the basis of the assumption of infinite reason."25 Many of S. Maimon's conceptions were developed in the light of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed.26 Thus, Maimonides' doctrine of the unity of the known and the object known was associated in S. Maimon's thought with his own conception, in which every finite cognition was rooted in the infinite cognition:27 the infinite divine reason is a unity of intellect and object of intellection; so human knowledge is only possible as a gradual process of overcoming the duality between intellect and the object of intellection, form and content. In other words: human knowledge is only possible as a gradual process, in which the subjective (human) cognition is incorporated within the comprehensive, objective intellect,28 i.e., the infinite one.29 The human intellect is a "scheme of the idea of the infinite intellect."30 The imprint of these conceptions is reflected in Rabbi Solo- veitchik's thought, and in his interpretation of Maimonides' philosophy,31 even though he does not follow the final conclusions of S. Maimon's philosophy (that is: Maimon's consistent idealistic position; see below). III Can this approach, which Maimonides was supposed "to have placed at the center of our world-view"-be adopted and applied as given to the conceptual world of Rabbi Soloveitchik? Does it, in fact, fit his own phi- losophy? Can Soloveitchik's theoretical assumptions assimilate Maimoni- des' doctrine of the intellect without a profound revision? A close study of Soloveitchik's words will reveal an interesting fact, a subtle but far-reaching transition in the original doctrine. Whenever the author presents and explains Maimonides' own position, serving as a loyal interpreter of the philosophy of the Guide of the Perplexed, the object of knowledge referred to is the world, the cosmos: the unity of intellect and intelligibilia-both Divine and human-is manifested in the cognition of the creation, the contemplation of nature. On the other hand, when the author goes on to develop his own independent thought, expounding his personal "neo-Maimonideanism," the object of knowl- edge referred to becomes the halakhah, the study of Torah: the unity of intellect and object of intellection- both Divine and human-is primarily related to the knowledge of God's word, not any more to that of God's world. It focuses on "the divine halakhic-ethical law."32 Indeed, "How characteristic was it that our sages distinguished two aspects in the com- mandment of loving God, whose essence is the communion with God: (a) contemplation of the Creation; (b) contemplation of the word of God, whose objective manifestation is [the study] of halakhah." This careful turn from the cosmos of the universe to the logos of the halakhah demands 163</page><page sequence="8">explanation and analysis. First and foremost, of course, it expresses a family and school tradition, characteristic of Lithuanian scholarship. Yet it also reflects a philosophic (epistemological) approach requiring some explanation. It would seem that two sources-a Rabbinical tradition on the one hand, and a modern philosophical problematic, on the other-were combined in order to reach this very conclusion and this very transition. (Below we shall also argue that the mutual interrelationship between the two different areas-between Creation and Sinai, between the law of the universe and the law of the halakhah-lies at the very heart of Solo- veitchik's thought and concerns). The intimate connection between this approach to the study of Torah and the Lithuanian Rabbinic scholarly tradition requires no proof. For instance, the writings of R. Hayyim of Volozhin develop and emphasize the conception of the study of the halakhah, Torah study, as an activity uniting the student with his object of contemplation, namely, with the Torah, the word of God, and finally-with the Divine wisdom and will. In other words, the intellectual study of the Torah is the very way of reaching communion with the Giver of the Torah Himself. As in some other Jewish texts,33 the idea of the unity of knower and known was combined with the mystical understanding of the Torah as an organic Divine entity: The man who truly takes upon himself the yoke of the holy Torah for its own sake ... actually clings to the Torah and to the Holy One, blessed be He, so to speak;34 Through studying Talmud and commentaries and all the pilpulim, everything is made to cling to the Holy One, blessed be He ... And by cleaving to His Torah, it is as if one is cleaving to Him;35 He, may He be blessed, and His will and His word are one. And it is through the study of Torah that one ought cleave to Him, may He be blessed, that is, cling with all his strength to the word of God, which is halakhah, and through this he actually cleaves to Him, so to speak.36 In R. Hayyim's thought, the Torah was elevated to a supreme onto- logical level above the cosmos, above nature, even beyond the expressions commonly found in Jewish mystical literature (its root was placed in the divine Infinite).37 However, a modern philosophical problematic also plays an im- portant role in Soloveitchik's turn from the original Maimonidean doctrine. Maimonides' doctrine concerning the unity of the human in- tellect and the cosmic object of intellection was based upon the assumption that the human mind is capable of comprehending the very nature of existence, its true essence and its rational lawfulness. It is within human capacity to penetrate into reality as such, to its intelligible nature, its formal and teleological causality. Only thus can the science of nature acquire its religious status: knowledge of the cosmos is in fact knowledge of the divine creation, apprehension of the attributes of Divine action. 164 A viezer Ravitzky</page><page sequence="9">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge The human mind does not create its own world, but faithfully reveals the world of God. This firm ground for rational contemplation of the cosmos was swept away from beneath the feet of modern man, or at least of those thinkers, including Rabbi Soloveitchik, who abandoned an Aristotelian epistemology and ontology and followed new theories in the philosophy of knowledge and the philosophy of science. Immanuel Kant's critical revolution granted cognitive man a creative power, a constructive function relating to the world. Cognition, on this view, does not only grasp and mirror a given world, does not only reveal and discover a given object existing as such, prior to the acquisition of knowledge. On the contrary, it plays an active role in the construction of the known object, organizing the multitude of sense data in light of its own categories of thought, of its a priori forms of intuition. These cate- gories and forms allow for cognition, enable experience; these are not derived from experience, but are applied to it, building it. "Kant's teach- ing, despite all the difficulties it involves, has not lost its validity. Reason does not mirror the 'given,' but adapts it to its needs. It filters it through the prism of categorical concepts in order to make it suitable to a scientific apperception" (Soloveitchik).38 It follows that knowledge does not pene- trate into an independent substance, into the thing-in-itself, but compre- hends reality through the intermediacy of a priori concepts and forms. It participates in the creation of its own world. The implications of this critical revolution, examined through the perspective of the traditional, rationalistic-religious philosophy, are clear: Medieval thought, such as that of Maimonides, has explained the im- possibility of the human mind acquiring positive knowledge of the divine essence, being entirely bound, as it is, to an anthropomorphic outlook, materially-rooted, by definition. Man cannot know divine "potency," "wisdom" and "will," or even "existence" and "unity," except through his own encounters with reality. However, if man is unable to comprehend the Creator, it is still possible for him to apprehend Creation, the Creator's world. Aristotelian physics taught the very principles of nature, its teleo- logical causality, its essence. Such knowledge may gain a religious sig- nificance: it is a knowledge of the divine attributes of action, of His wisdom and His will revealed in creation. However, modern critical philosophy has removed this claim as well as any direct possibility of knowing God, indeed man cannot even know the world of God. Man's universe is completely mediated by his own perceptions, it is constructed and organized in terms of his own conceptual categories. Precisely the new creative status enjoyed by human cognition deprives it of its re- ligious status, its essential relationship to the creator and to the cre- ation. Maimonides drew a sharp distinction between human knowledge, derived from the given world, and divine knowledge, which creates the 165</page><page sequence="10">Aviezer Ravitzky given world; between human knowledge, acquired in light of the existing object, through a posteriori cognition, and divine knowledge, which forms the very object and "precedes" it: "For we know all that we know only through looking at the beings ... Our insights are renewed and multiplied according to the things from which we acquire the knowledge of them. He, may He be exalted, is not like that... I mean that His knowledge of things is not derived from them ... The things in question follow upon His knowledge, which preceded and established them as they are" (Guide III: 21).39 According to this doctrine, precisely because human knowledge is acquired "according to the things" as they are, precisely because it differs from divine knowledge by perceiving, not creating, a given reality, it is able to unite with the true-substance, the true cosmos-i.e., with Creation itself. Following the Kantian critique, on the other hand, after human cognition was granted a creative role, its capacity of uniting with the thing-in-itself, of knowing a divine intelligible, was lost. Furthermore: Rabbi Soloveitchik has repeatedly emphasized in his writings the abstract, symbolic and synthetic nature of modern mathemati- cal sciences, as opposed to that of medieval Aristotelian science. Modern science no longer claims to expound the real world, nature as such, but to "duplicate it," to construct theoretical models parallel to it: it creates abstract models, symbolic systems which are meant to replicate and to represent nature. From now on, science applies itself to a formal-mathe- matical-quantitative system-i.e., to its own construction. The organs of this system do not enjoy an independent existence, their entire meaning inhering in their interrelationships and mutual connections, in the quantitative formulae which shape them as a unified theoretical-ideal model. Soloveitchik considers this nature of scientific activity an acknowl- degement of the irrational character of existence, a conscious withdrawal from the pretentious claims of knowledge by earlier generations: Aristotelian physics wished to explain existence, in terms of its qualita- tive essence ... Many generations believed, in all innocence, in the pos- sibility of rational explanation concerning real-qualitative existence. Classical, as well as modern, physics relinquished this far-reaching and daring claim. It understood the non-rational nature of the universe, when it manifests itself in its everyday, primitive image, and abandoned scientific understanding thereof. The deeper truth which revealed itself to the practitioners of the natural sciences was that man is unable to comprehend the essence of concrete phenomena and to know them, but he may make formal-quantitative constructions which parallel the con- crete phenomena.40 Aristotelian physics wished to explain reality in terms of its true, qualitative essence as known to us, and it failed, deceiving many suc- ceeding generations, who naively believed in the possibility of intel- lectual clarity with regard to qualitative existence.4' 166</page><page sequence="11">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge It should be clear that such a transition from the cognitive universe of Aristotelian-Maimonidean physics to modern science-i.e., from the attempt to uncover the principles of nature itself, the essence of things, to the emphasis upon quantitative models, upon human constructions, also involves the expulsion of man from the unity of subject and object, knower and known, within nature; therefore, man's expulsion from the possibility of communion with God via the intellectual cognition of the world. To the contrary, in certain expressions of Soloveitchik's thought, it appears that the man of faith gains a real, concrete hold upon reality and a revelation of the divine within nature, precisely by abandoning the intellectual, conceptual approach of the man of science, and by relating himself directly to the immediate givens, in the spirit of those modern doctrines which stress vitality, direct experience and the concrete en- counter with sensual reality. The man of faith "does not create a world of his own. Instead, he wants to understand the living, 'given' world into which he has been cast. Therefore, he does not mathematize phenomena or conceptualize things. He encounters the universe in all its colorfulness, splendor and grandeur, and studies it with the naivete, awe and admira- tion of the child ... (He) is receptive and beholds the world in its original dimensions."42 Such a conception of the true encounter with nature has gone very far from the ideal of intellectual unity with nature from which the post-Kantian philosopher has found himself expelled. In conclusion, it should be noted that the gap between the Mai- monidean, pre-critical theory of knowledge, and the Kantian, post-critical theory of knowledge, concerning this very question was already discussed by Solomon Maimon in his commentary Giv'ath ha-Moreh, to the Guide I: 68: According to Kant, cognition involves two different elements, namely, intellect and senses; the sense is that which receives the materials [contents] of cognition [experience] from an outside thing[-in-itself] concealed from us, while the intellect is the very agent of the form of cognition ... In this way, the intellect, the intellectually cognizing sub- ject and the intellectually cognized object are one and the same thing, only in the sense that the form of cognition is the very object of cogni- tion . . . while the outside thing[-in-itself], which is the cause of the existence of the object of the senses, is not sense[-in-itself] and is not cognized in-itself, because its essence is entirely concealed from us. That is: Kant's theory does not allow one to overcome the duality between intellectual cognition, on the one hand, and the external thing- in-itself, on the other. The unity of subject and object, knower and known, is only possible when cognition reflects upon itself. It is impossible when contemplating an external entity. S. Maimon's own philosophical doctrine has aimed to overcome this duality. His idealistic solution denied the very existence of any external 167</page><page sequence="12">Aviezer Ravitzky thing beyond cognition. There are not two different elements-the thing- in-itself on the one hand and cognition on the other. The former is derived from the latter. Were our intellectual cognition complete, in- finite and total, there would be nothing external to it. Infinite conscious- ness incorporates all contents and objects within itself, and there would be nothing independent of it: existing equals being known. It is only the finitude and limitations of the human mind which lead us to imagine that our intellect is determined by some external reality, by an inde- pendent factor-"the thing-in-itself." Thus, human cognition should be understood as a gradual infinite progression towards the infinite intellect, by means of the negation of the "external," and overcoming the duality of subject and object. It was the mathematical cognition which served Maimon as the ideal model for all cognition whatsoever: just as the objects of mathematics are not independent entities determinative of the intellect, but pure intelligibles determined by the intellect, the same is true for all true cognition. It follows that Maimon's philosophical uni- verse was "populated" by a finite intellect, on the one hand, and by infi- nite intellect, on the other (at least in the sense of a methodological con- cept), the former searching infinitely to meet the latter. It should be noted that certain traces of such an idealistic approach also appear in Rabbi Soloveitchik's interpretation of Maimonides' com- ments concerning the unity of the knower and the object known. In U-viqqastem mis-sam, he referred to an "idealistic assumption"43 and an "idealistic element"44 in Maimonides' teaching on this subject; in Halakhic Man, the reader is even referred to those modern commentators on the Guide of the Perplexed who followed such an idealistic interpretation of Maimonides45 (S. Maimon, D. Neumark,46 Y. Kaufmann;47 see below for Soloveitchik's relation to H. Cohen48). However, another element in Soloveitchik's approach towards the Guide (that of the unity of intellect, will and action49) prevents him from going too far in this idealistic in- terpretation. In any event, it is clear that Soloveitchik's own thought is quite far from philosophical idealism: the emphasis upon the role of the unmediated, experiential encounter with nature, the quest for "the given living world",50 after "the real, living, continuous quality,"51 clearly re- veal the influence of other modern trends of thought, affirming real, concrete existence, going beyond the structure of science and the con- structions of the human mind. Also the acknowledgement of the existence of an irrational element in reality clearly does not accord with the idealistic approach. "Solomon Maimon and Hermann Cohen ... created ... an exaggerated doctrine of idealism which subjects reality to cognition possessed of an absolute character."52 This system, too, is incapable of saving the unity of human intellect and the intelligible cosmos, subject and object, of restoring the aspiration of scholars of former generations. 168</page><page sequence="13">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge IV At this point we reach the cautious, somewhat concealed shift of Rabbi Soloveitchik from the original Maimonidean doctrine of the unity of the knower and the object known: from the universe to the halakhah,53 from the acquisition of cosmic knowledge to the acquisition of Torah knowledge. Since medieval thought created a barrier between human knowledge and the essence of God, to which modern thought added the barrier between human knowledge and the essence of the world-was there any remaining realm to which man's intellect could really penetrate, by which man would be able to acquire a sort of knowledge which can be granted a religious significance? Was there a domain of creative spiritual activity left which-like science-also deals with a conceptual system, with theo- retical structures, although, unlike science, in it the conceptual and theoretical activity do not reflect a withdrawal from the essential nature, from the thing-in-itself, but, to the contrary, contact with the essence itself, a penetration into the realm of the absolute? Is there some sphere which is "idealistic" by its nature? This is the root of the transition from the cosmos to the halakhah, from Creation to Sinai. One of the characteristic statements in Rabbi Soloveitchik's writings, which drew the attention of many readers and critics, draws an analogy between halakhic knowledge and scientific-mathematical knowledge, between the creative activity of the Torah student and that of the modern scientist. We have already noted that, in the wake of the Lithuanian schol- arly tradition, Soloveitchik interpreted the halakhah not only as a group of norms guiding our activities, but also as a conceptual, theoretical structure, addressed towards our cognition. He repeatedly emphasizes the speculative and abstract nature of halakhic creativity, its a-priori and ideal approach to reality, similar to scientific cognition: "If we will fa- miliarize ourselves with the method of conceptualization and mathe- maticization of nature adopted by the founders of classical and modern physics, from the time of Galileo and Newton to the present, we will be able to understand also the path of R. Hayyim [of Brisk] in halakhah, which is strangely similar to the approach of mathematical sciences to the real world."54 Mathematics serves as an archetype for ideal, a-priori cognition. Halakhah and mathematical science are similar in their crea- tive, abstract, and conceptual nature. Yet this is the crux of the matter: this very similarity between hala- khah and science alludes also to the primacy of the halakhah, and its su- periority: it is within the halakhic domain, and only there, that "human thought, subject to the principles of logic, 'dared' to penetrate to a realm not its own and to hold onto it";55 it is there, and only there, that the theoretical and abstract character of the spiritual endeavor does not 169</page><page sequence="14">Aviezer Raxvtzky remove cognition from true reality, from the absolute. Unlike natural science, halakhic creativity "suits," so to speak, by its very nature, the idealistic approach. Because, in the realm of the halakhah, we are-to begin with-dealing with nothing but the infinite Divine intellect and the finite human intellect, and there is no need to seek a correlation to any concrete reality; Talmud-Torah, unlike the science of the cosmos, is not derived from any reality. It imposes its rule upon reality. One cannot know the world as it is, but one can know it as it ought to be. We are concerned here with creative spiritual activity, activity through which the human and the divine meet by means of ideal, a priori contents, contents which should direct reality, and not vice-versa. Thus, halakhah represents "a hierarchy of ideas, all of which is a splendid work of archi- tecture, whose base lays on the earth, in everyday life, and whose head reaches the heavens, the heights of intellectual abstraction and tran- scendental cleaving to the infinite intellect of the giver of the Torah."56 Note: here, and only here, "intellectual abstraction" no longer reflects the abandonment of the pretense of the mind to penetrate to the true, ultimate essence, it no longer manifests a withdrawal from reality as such, by means of its duplication in a theoretical model, but, on the con- trary-it represents the very entry into the realm of the absolute-"cleav- ing to the infinite intellect of the giver of the Torah." Moreover, this intellectual strategy, leading to the primacy of the halakhah, does not stay with the analogy to the abstract and conceptual character of modern science, but also relates to the creative character of cognition in general. Within the domain of the halakhah, man's inde- pendent, creative activity acquired legitimacy ab initio, a substantive role in the very shaping of the truth. Its constructive nature does not take one away from "the thing-in-itself" (namely, the word of God): "Halakhic man received the Torah from Sinai not as a simple recipient but as a creator of worlds, as a partner with the Almighty in the act of creation."57 A "Kantian revolution," so to speak, already took place within the world of halakhah long ago, from its very inception; "The halakhic contents, which are essentially revealed [by God] were subjected to the nature of [human] intellectual cognition."58 However, unlike other spheres of human intellectual activity, this "revolution" does not negate the religious status of knowledge. No doubt in the halakhah, as in other spheres, knowledge is shaped by a double activity, by the combination of two sources: the word of God from Sinai, on the one hand, and the cognitive construction, developed and innovated by the halakhic scholar, on the other hand. However, within the world of halakhah, it was the former who proclaimed the ultimate legislative authority of the latter: "My children have defeated me!" [see Ba Va Mezia 59b]. This proclamation of the legitimacy of man's creative activity combines two aspects: A. The legal-metaphysical aspect: "transferral of authority" -"The Holy 170</page><page sequence="15">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge One has, as it were, handed over His imprimatur, His official seal in Torah matters, to man."59 Halakhic-legal truth is established through its own immanent processes, by its own standards, in accordance with the outcome of the "cooperation" between the two realms, divine and human. There is no thing-in-itself beyond it: the novellae of the Talmudic scholar are the very truth of the Torah. B. The cognitive-metaphysical aspect: "unity of intellect and intelligible" -"Torah which becomes combined with the individual's uniqueness and becomes an inseparable part of man."60 The apex of the ladder of ascen- sion of the religious personality is the overcoming of the distance between subject and object, individual and the Torah: the "external" is discovered within the "internal"-the theonomic prophetic message within the au- tonomous cognition. The modern critique of knowledge does not apply to the world of Torah, in which the door was not closed to the sage who penetrates to the very essence of the object of knowledge, for whom the logos of the Torah of God becomes united with his own logos:61 "the unity of intellect and intelligible applies ... to the halakhic congition of the revealed command, which unites the finite with the infinite."62 V At the beginning of his philosophical career, Rabbi Soloveitchik intended to write a doctoral dissertation on the subject of "Maimonides and Plato."63 As against the common interpretation of Maimonides' phi- losophy as closely related to the Aristotelian school, he intended to demonstrate a different dimension of Maimonidean thought, namely, its relationship to Platonic philosophy. Due to the absence of an appropriate advisor for such a thesis, his dissertation was finally devoted to the neo- Kantian thought of Hermann Cohen. Interestingly enough, this claim concerning the Platonic tendency of Maimonides' philosophy was pointed out earlier by Hermann Cohen himself. Cohen taught that "Maimonides was attached to Plato far more deeply than to Aristotle,"4 a view underlying and guiding Cohen's com- prehensive article on "The Character of Maimonides' Ethics." To what does this refer? What are the supposed Platonic traits of Maimonides' ethics? A. The Priority of Ethics Aristotle placed the knowledge of the world, the structure of being, at the center of his philosophic concern. The focus of his study, of his sci- entific speculation, has been the question of existence, of the is, and not 171</page><page sequence="16">Aviezer Ravitzky the question of ethics, the ought. "His heart was not filled with the deep and sublime questions of ethics."65 On the other hand, the Platonic spirit66 represented for Cohen the centrality and priority of moral philosophy67 as opposed to physics and metaphysics. The Platonic world, as opposed to the Aristotelian one, is not closed and self-contained, is not explained in its own terms, but in light of the "teleological connection between nature and ethics."68 The final account of the world69 necessarily leads to the idea of the good. B. Ethics as Science Aristotle saw ethics as the theory of social conventions and relative as- sumptions, and not as a problem of cognition or of systematic knowledge. It is a matter for "psychological description and historical development"70 and not for an autonomous, unconditional cognitive structure. The Platonic spirit, on the other hand, represents for Hermann Cohen the turn towards ethics as a science, an area demanding study, research and systematic knowledge. Already within the teaching of Socrates ethical theory had become a science-"The Science [par excellence], the focal point of human cognition."71 Plato developed his master's line of thought, basing his entire cognitive system, all areas of knowledge, upon the notion of the good. The good is the first and last ground of all knowledge, the only independent, non-derivative area of cognition, and the queen of sciences. Only in this domain can one attain inner certainty, systematic and unconditioned knowledge (the Platonic anhyphotheton).72 Hermann Cohen assumed that these ideas lie in the very center of Maimonides' teaching. What is the focal concept within Maimonides' thought? God. What is the supreme form of knowledge in the intellectual world of Maimonides? Knowledge of God. But God does not make Himself known to man save by His deeds, His attributes of action - mercy, compassion, loving-kindness, justice and righteousness-that is, by His ethical actions.73 It follows that the essence of theology is none other than knowledge of the good; Maimonides "based the concept of God upon the ethical concept of God"; "Morality is God's known essence."74 Knowledge of God in Maimonides' thought was therefore not addressed towards the God of nature, but towards the God of ethics.75 This interpretation of Maimonides (the problematic character of which cannot be discussed here) was supposed to bring the philosophy of Maimonides closer to that of Plato (that is, closer to the conceptual world of Hermann Cohen). Both aspects mentioned above, the primacy of ethics and its status as a science, were secured by grounding ethics in the central conception within Maimonides' thought-i.e., God. First and foremost, man's path towards his Creator is not taught by the cosmos or 172</page><page sequence="17">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge by nature, but through the good, through ethics. Human morality should be based upon an imitation of the ways of God, an imitation of Divinity and known to us-kindness and justice and righteousness. Secondly, ethics is no longer a matter of custom, of social conventions, but the focal point of human science, the pinnacle of knowledge-the knowledge of God. Maimonides "was certain of the cognitive status of ethics ... knowl- edge of God served him as the basis for the knowledge of ethics."76 Therefore, the good was granted its Platonic stature as an independent, primary realm of knowledge, unconditional, the focal point. Maimonides' concern with contemplation and reflection is no longer addressed towards knowledge of God as being or as intellect, but towards knowledge of God as the supreme good, knowledge of His ethical attributes. The highest human goal, imitatio dei, no longer sets for man the Aristotelian ideal of happiness-that of pure intellectual cognition contemplating being-but ethical self-perception, in light of the knowledge of the good. What is Rabbi Soloveitchik's relationship to these ideas-perhaps Platonic, perhaps Maimonidean, perhaps neo-Kantian? In our analysis above we have taken note of two central points in Soloveitchik's approach: first, the transformation of the Maimonidean concept of the unity of intellect and intelligibles, from the cosmos as the object of contemplation to the halakhah as the object of contemplation, from knowledge of God via Creation to knowledge of God via Sinai. Second, the positing of the halakhah as an independent cognitive system, a systematic conceptual structure. Can these two points now be under- stood in accordance with the two aspects of "the Platonic spirit" (according to Hermann Cohen)? First, can the transition from the cosmos to the halakhah correspond to Cohen's assertion about the change of focus of human cognition from the cosmos to ethics, from the is to the ought? Secondly, can the interpretation of the halakhah as a realm of systematic and conceptual knowledge be seen in light of Cohen's emphasis upon ethics as a science? These questions demand a two-fold answer. We shall begin by ana- lyzing the positive relationship between the two thinkers. First of all, Soloveitchik adopted Cohen's interpretation of the Divine attributes of action in Maimonides' thought as ethical attributes (an inter- pretation questioned by most contemporary scholars). "Maimonides already taught in the Guide of the Perplexed (I, 54) that cognition of [God's] actions is the source of ethical life."77 Man's knowledge of God focuses upon the ethical attributes of God, upon the "attributes of action, which lay the foundation for Jewish ethics."78 This knowledge passes on to the realm of deeds and behavior-walking in God's path, "imitation of His creative actions." Like Hermann Cohen, Soloveitchik also poses Maimonides' ethical doctrine against the Aristotelian "eudaemonic ideal," -i.e., the life of pure contemplation and reflection. Against this ideal, 173</page><page sequence="18">A viezer Ravitzky both these thinkers place at the center of Maimonides' aspiration the building of personality, acquired through ethical "self-perfection" (Cohen)79 or through halakhic "self-creation".80 (Soloveitchik -elsewhere "ethical perfection, as posited by Halakhah."81) Both agree also in as- serting the unity of cognition and will in Maimonidean thought.82 The influence of Cohen's thought may be detected even in some details of Soloveitchik's interpretation of the Guide. For example, in Guide I: 2, Maimonides sharply distinguished between such concepts as truth and falsehood, which belong to the realm of intellectual knowledge, and such concepts as fine and bad, which belong to that of human con- ventions-i.e., "to the things generally accepted as known, not to those cognized by the intellect." This distinction is one which endangers the cognitive status of ethics according to Cohen's interpretation. It may make morality a matter for social agreement, in accordance with the Aristotelian view, rather than a matter of cognitive truth. Cohen was therefore forced to argue that the "fine and bad" referred to by Mai- monides should not be understood as ethical notions, but as aesthetic ones, corresponding to the beautiful and the ugly.83 Rabbi Soloveitchik also favors this peculiar and problematic interpretation of Maimonides' text84 (asking him about it in a personal conversation,85 the first response I got was: "This is the way Hermann Cohen explains it"). Another example: Cohen stressed the crucial importance of the four concluding chapters of the Guide: "The concluding chapters of the Guide are the center of gravity of the book; it is all directed towards them . . . the problem of the love of God."86 Cohen considered these chapters as a clear manifestation of the gap existing between Maimonides' thought and the Aristotelian system, criticizing that trend within Maimonidean scholarship which disregarded their importance.87 Rabbi Soloveitchik makes a very similar observation: "In the final chapters of the Guide of the Perplexed Maimonides offers us an explanation of the concept 'the service of the heart'. The philosophers and historians who have written about Maimonides generally do not deal with these chapters, though it is in them-and not in the 'Aristotelian' chapters-that the real Maimonides is revealed."88 (Cohen's direct influence is clear, as there was ground for such criticism of Maimonidean scholarship in Cohen's day, while in more recent years these concluding chapters have occupied a central role in scholarly interest).89 The parallels also apply to some other details. Secondly, the "Platonic" conception of ethics as a realm of systematic knowledge may also correspond to Soloveitchik's conception of the halakhah as a realm of theoretical and systematic knowledge, analogous to the scientific one. Hermann Cohen, already in the early stages of his thought, has taught that the need for an ethical theory cannot be satisfied by the mere awareness of moral duty or by Kant's formal categorical imperative ("Act only on the maxim which you can at the same time will 174</page><page sequence="19">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge to become a universal law"). The task of ethics as a science was to fill the moral imperative with contents, to construct the principles of ethics, and to reveal the basic assumptions underlying concrete law and jurispru- dence.90 Cohen himself certainly could not find such contents within the realm of the halakhah, which he could not conceive as a conceptual structure, as an autonomous realm of systematic theoretical study,91 as did Soloveitchik, the student of the Lithuanian rabbinic school. Cohen, to be sure, does not construct law and justice in light of any halakhic sources. However, Rabbi Soloveitchik, who is deeply involved in the specific rules and detailed contents of the halakhah, who from his youth has known it as a realm of conceptual knowledge, would make just such an attempt'to associate these two traditions-the philosophical one and the Talmudic one. "The old saying of Socrates, that virtue is knowledge, is strikingly similar to the stance of halakhic man."92 Did he not incor- porate the "Platonic" (i.e., Cohenian) position concerning the autonomous and unconditional character of ethics, as opposed to the Aristotelian approach to morality as a matter of "psychological description and historical development" (in Cohen's words),93 with halakhic man's position about "the full autonomy of halakhic logic" and his sharp opposition to "psy- chologization or socioligization of the halakhah" (in Soloveitchik's words).94 Truly, the two positions must not be confused: Cohen's attempt to estab- lish the principles of autonomous ethics is not identical to the effort of the man of halakhah who seeks to uncover the concepts of theonomic halakhic ethics;95 Cohen's ethical theory, which searched out the theoreti- cal principles presumed by law, underlying law, is different from Torah study as a structure of legal knowledge, whose logic is immanent within itself, is embodied in its very specific concepts and detailed rules. How- ever, both approaches share the conception of the good as a cognitive realm, which is directed towards our intellect, not only towards our will. It is also worthy of note that Cohen did not adopt the sharp dichotomy drawn by Kant between law, as instruction imposed on man by external authority, and ethics, as the inner dictate of the mind.96 Cohen attempted to uncover the principles of ethics underlying the concrete system of law.97 This connection between ethics and law already brings Cohen's earlier thought closer to the Jewish tradition, in which law and ethics are united. In Soloveitchik's approach, of course, there exists only the halakhah,98 whose concepts are embodied within its own laws.99 VI The point of contact between these two thinkers is also their point of di- vergence. It is precisely their corresponding positions concerning the moral attributes of action and their common understanding of the realm 175</page><page sequence="20">Aviezer Ravitzky of ethics as a cognitive realm, which also illuminates the point at which their paths divide. This is also the issue where the inner tension within Soloveitchik's thought-between Maimonidean and Neo-Kantian phi- losophy-becomes most apparent. The philosophy of Kant sharply distinguished between the realms of the real and the ideal, between the "is" and the "ought." Fact and duty constitute two different spheres: nature does not reflect in itself an ethi- cal order, a teleological moral structure. The good is not embodied in reality, but is an independent domain, separated from the world as given. To the contrary, it reflects the very antithesis of nature, including human nature; the demand to impose a law, an order, upon chaotic reality. Thus, theoretical and practical reason move in separate channels. The idealism of Hermann Cohen also sustains a clear distinction between these two realms-fact and duty. Reason legislates one law for nature, and another law for the moral will. Ethics is an autonomous realm. It is designed to be realized in nature,?00 through a continuous progression,'10 but is never within nature. "The ethical ideal is not dupli- cated by any reality."102 A deep gap was opened between the moral norm and the world's order. Ethics is meant to free man from nature. This is true both of Cohen's ethical philosophy as of his later religious philosophy-i.e., his effort to develop a philosophical midrash out of Jewish sources, including Maimonides. Henceforth, the distance between the ideal and the real is represented by the distance between the divine ethical attributes and the created world: the ethical attributes of action are ascribed to God as separated from nature, and not to nature; to the unique God, who has no equal, and not to any reality. It is not creation which manifests God's attributes, rather His revelation, beyond crea- tion;103 thus, the gap between duty and fact was sustained. The attributes of action are primarily interpreted as instructions concerning human behavior, as commandments, obligations-i.e., God's revelation to man as a model for moral imitation: "Hence the attributes of action are not so much characteristics of God, but rather conceptually determined models for the action of man . .. [they] could be valid for the actions of man only."'04 The divine attributes are supposed to represent an ethical ideal, meant to take man out of the natural order to the moral order. It seems that Cohen has ignored the fact that Maimonides specifically presented reality, creation itself, as God's attribute of action: "Rather all His acts, may He be exalted, are an absolute good; for He only produces being, and all being is a good" (Guide III: 10); "'I will make all My goodness pass before thee' [Ex. 33:19]-'All my goodness' alludes to the display to him of all existing things" (Ibid., I: 54). In Maimonides' thought, when ethical notions-i.e., goodness, kindness, judgment, righteousness -are attributed to God homonymously, they are endowed with an onto- logical sense; 105 "existence being indubitably a good" (Ibid. III: 25). Mai- 176</page><page sequence="21">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge monides ascribes the attributes of action to creation, while Cohen ascribes them to revelation, beyond creation; Maimonides understands their meaning in the context of the cosmos, while Cohen does so in the context of man and God (an idealistic turn). This deviation was not an accidental one: in view of Cohen's understanding of the attributes of action in con- nection with moral norms, there was no way but to "reinterpret" Mai- monides' text. For any ethical status granted to creation itself, to existence as such, and not only to the revelatory norm, would confuse between the ideal and the real, between the sphere of the good and the sphere of nature, while, as we have said, Cohen considered the ideal, by definition, as separated from the real.16 That is: Cohen's interpretation of the divine attributes of action within the context of ethics, together with his Kantian conception which rules out any bridge between the ethical law and the ontological law, guided his unique understanding. However, this very bridge between the moral law and the ontological law is asserted in the writings of Rabbi Soloveitchik: The idea that the creation of the world was a moral act... is the basis of Maimonides' doctrine of ethical attributes.107 The source of ethics is God, and its embodiment is in creation. The fact of being is an embodiment of the ethical will .. the highest ethical good is perfected being . . . imitation of God, the foundation of Israelite morality, is expressed in imitation of His creative acts ... The entire cosmic process is the revelation of divine ethics.108 "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament reciteth His handiwork" (Ps. 19:2). But what is the tale of the heavens, if not the proclamation of the norm? What is the recitation of the firmament if not the declaration of the commandment? ... We can know God's ways only through studying the cosmos, for it is in the cosmos that there stand revealed before us the glorious and resplendent attributes of action ... In order to implement the ethical ideal we must fix upon the whole of being and cognize it. This cognition is teleological in essence -it aims to reveal the traces of the norm hidden within reality(!).109 These ideas are quite far-reaching: Creation is a combination of fact and value: the norm is rooted in being itself, the "ought" in the "is.""1 Indeed, a certain relationship between the ideal and the real is already implicit in the very idea of monotheism: the Creator Himself is also the one who commands, i.e., existence and norm flow from one and the same origin. However, in Soloveitchik's writings, this idea was carried even further: not only are the Creator and the Commander one, but also creation and commandment are unified: "Judaism declared that there is no difference between revealed law and ontological law but by [human] perception. The ontological law, demonstrated in the existence of crea- tion, makes itself known to man as a revealed ethical commandment."11 177</page><page sequence="22">A viezer Ravitzky Unlike Kant's categorical imperative, which imposes upon existence an external demand, not inherent in itself, and unlike some alternative ethical theories, which anchor ethics in human existence-psychological, sociological, etc. or in human interest, we hear of a third, ethical alterna- tive, which anchors ethics in cosmic existence. It is Soloveitchik's interpre- tation of the attributes of action within an ethical context, similar to Cohen, on the one hand, and his faithfulness to Maimonides' teaching concerning creation as God's attribute of action, on the other hand, which guided his unique approach: Divine creation- God's attributes of action-is good; human good- man's imitation of God's action-is cre- ative (i.e., the halakhah). This conception, connecting value and nature together, demands an additional philosophical foundation. Indeed, already in Maimonides' Guide we read that "the Law [Torah], although it is not natural, enters into what is natural" (Guide, II: 40). Maimonides, the medieval philoso- pher, found an internal teleological order in nature, a mutual purposive connection between the different organs of the cosmos. Man himself was also not removed from this teleological order. Therefore, Law and com- mandments, guiding man's ways in the world, should also join this tele- ology, directing reality towards its actualization.112 (This is the logic underlying Maimonides' exphasis upon the reasons for the command- ments.) Divine wisdom is one, revealed both in Creation and in Law-i.e., Torah is intended towards the fulfilment of the final ends of both individ- ual and society, as we are fixed and rooted in creation. However, this approach, based upon the putative inner logic of time and place, cannot fit within the thought of Rabbi Soloveitchik, who entirely rejects the Aristotelian pretense to penetrate into the principles of nature, to its causality and teleological purposiveness. In Soloveitchik's thought, the halakhah is conceived as a closed, autonomous system, coherent only in terms of itself, explainable in light of its inner conceptual processes, rather than of reasons and ends laying beyond it-whether human or cosmic. For a human cognition, which can no longer penetrate to sub- stance and essence, which has lost its ontological status, is also unable to penetrate to the reason and purpose of the Creator-Commander. There- fore, the medieval effort to bridge between commandment and nature cannot serve in Soloveitchik's modern thought (despite his comment cited above concerning the "teleological cognition," which reveals the "hidden norm within reality"). Moreover: this approach, asssociating value and nature together, was supposed to coexist with Soloveitchik's repeated emphasis upon the ideal and a priori character of the halakhah, with his approach to the halakhah as antithetical to given reality, and not as alluded to in and through it. As we have noted, the halakhah was described as a categorical system which is not derived from any existence, as a norm, an ideal,l"3 178</page><page sequence="23">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge "the ideal image of reality.""4 The "desire of the soul of the man of halakhah is to observe the completion of the lacks of creation, as it becomes adjusted to the ideal world.""15 If so, does reality teach halakhah, or does it serve as a substratum for the realization of the halakhah? Is there a norm inherent in nature, or only a norm confronting nature? Is there in fact any integral relationship between value and being? It should be said: the relationship between reality and halakhah was based upon the concept of anticipation. Creation "expects" Sinai, the cosmos "invites" halakhic creativity. In what sense? In "Halakhic Man," Soloveitchik develops a unique idea, which even if it does not offer a complete rational solution, is of undoubted beauty and charm. What is creation? The establishment of boundaries, the distinction between cosmos and chaos, the separation of "the complete, perfect existence from the forces of negation, confusion, and turmoil.""6 The law of creation sets up borders, engraves, carves out boundaries between existence and void, shaping and forming."17 What is halakhic creativity? The establish- ment of boundaries, the distinction between holy and profane, between "the image of God or the beast of prey.""8 The law of the halakhah sets up limits, definitions-"Man's task is to 'fashion', engrave, attach and create"119- self-creation. In other words: the halakhah, like creation, implies construction and formation by means of quantification and definition, distinction and separation. In sum, creation is an "halakhic" occurence, while halakhic activity is a "creative" occurence.120 The Divine creative act, establishing the real, on the one hand, and the human creative act, concretizing and actualizing the ideal, on the other hand, are contiguous: "Just as the Almighty constantly refined and improved the realm of existence during the six days of creation, so must man complete that creation and transform the domain of chaos and void into a perfect and beautiful reality."'12 Halakhic activity complements the act of creation-"He created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited." [Isa. 45:18]'22 These images illustrate an essential point, beyond metaphor: the argument about the mutual connection between the world and the hala- khah refers to the very existence of the world, its very being, rather than to its being as it is, its qualities and specific inner laws. It concerns the "is" as such, not the "what" and "how." The opposite is also true: the mutual connection between the halakhah and the world refers to halakhah as a totality, its very principle as creative activity, rather than to its specific concepts and particular laws. It relates to the very idea of halakhah, and not to its detailed "laws, rules, principles and judgments."'23 That is, not the specific concepts and laws of the halakhah are alluded to by the "norm concealed within creation." Only the "telos of the halakhah"124 is implied by and inherent in creation. Not the fact that the world as it is requires this particular law, but the very fact that the world exists points 179</page><page sequence="24">Aviezer Ravitzky towards the idea of the halakhah.'25 One should not look for a specific reason for a specific commandment, but one can find a reason why there is Law and commandment as such.'26 Reality itself, creation per se, an- ticipate a theoretical-normative structure to complete it. Man imitates his creator by delimiting and measuring with an a-priori knowledge, which imposes upon and "creates" reality. Finally, the idea of anticipation is also associated with the question of moral autonomy. Not only does cosmic nature "allude" to the command- ment and reveal the value but human nature as well, when attaining its sublimest heights and realization, reveals within itself the command: "as though the divine command were identical to the demand of the intel- lectual, creative consciousness";'27 "Halakhic man does not experience any consciousness of compulsion accompanying the norm. Rather, it seems to him as though he discovered the norm in his innermost self, as though it was not just a commandment that had been imposed upon him, but an existential law of his very being."'28 Man's spirit discovers within itself an anticipation of the commandment, just as creation finds within itself an anticipation of Sinai. Value and nature, theonomy and autonomy, once again come together. With this we close the circle drawn in this paper-from the real, the cosmic order, to the ideal, the halakhic order, and back again.

As, in the final analysis, the two philosophers are one and the same person, a certain degree of internal tension is to be expected within the system. The phi- losopher of the dialectic religious personality may go so far as to say: "Man is a dialectical being; an inner schism runs through his personality at every level . . (this) schism is willed by God as the source of man's greatness and his election as a singular charismatic being ... Judaic dialectic, unlike the Hegelian, is irrecon- cilable and hence interminable . . . Complete reconciliation is an eschatological vision ... In the world of realities, the harmony of opposites is an impossibility . .. Man is ... involved in an unresolvable contradiction, in an insoluble dialectic" ("Majesty and Humility," Tradition, Vol. 17, No. 2 [1978], pp. 25-26). On the other hand, the philosopher of the halakhah teaches that, "'In accordance with the suffering is the reward' [Avot 5: 23] and in accordance with the split the union!" (Halakhic Man, p. 4 [Heb., p. 12]) and that "the Halakhah considered the steady oscillating of the man of faith between majesty and covenant not as a dialectical but rather as a complementary movement" ("Lonely Man of Faith," p. 51); "The man of God begins with duality and ends in unity" ("U-viqqastem mis-sam," p. 193). (Prof. L. Kaplan, in an unpublished lecture, attributed this to the dif- ference in the languages in which the essays, directed to different audiences, were written. However, the quotations cited above make such a distinction doubtful.) Yet, it should be noted: the halakhah, and only the halakhah, enjoys the status of an overriding principle. Philosophy is always to be derived from the realm of the halakhah, and not vice versa. Ultimately, there should be one guiding cri- terion in light of which the duality within the religious personality would be 181</page><page sequence="26">A viezer Ravitzky judged. We read that the halakhah has a "monistic approach to reality" and that "The halakhah sees in the ethico-moral norm a uniting force" ("Lonely Man of Faith," pp. 51-52). Yet at times it seems as if the dialectical philosopher of the religious personality has broken out of his bonds. 13. "U-viqqastem mis-sam," pp. 122, 125. 14. Ibid., p. 229. 15. Ibid., p. 235. 16. Ibid., p. 193. The Hegelian methodology may serve here against Hegel's own claim which characterized Judaism as the religion of obedience, of enslave- ment and of negation of human free-will (a common claim in modern philosophy, in various forms). See: G. W. F. Hegel, Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion, (London, 1895), p. 227. 17. "U-viqqastem mis-sam," was published more than thirty years after Halakhic Man. However, an early version of the essay, under the title, "Ish ha-Elohim" ("The Man of God"), was already written in the years immediately following the appearance of the former (as reported in a public lecture by Soloveitchik's son- in-law, Rabbi Dr. Aharon Lichtenstein). 18. "U-viqqastem mis-sam," p. 195. 19. See: Shlomo Pines, "The Philosophic Sources of the Guide of the Per- plexed," in Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, translated by S. Pines (Chicago, 1963), p. xcviii. 20. Such an interpretation could rely upon Guide I:1; 111:52, and to some extent 11:37 and 111:17 (the fifth opinion: "and which is our opinion"). 21. "U-viqqastem mis-sam," p. 201. 22. Ibid., pp. 202-203. The author adds: "an infinite ethical will, which is entirely activity and creativity." Throughout the discussion, Soloveitchik adds to the idea of the identity of intellect and intelligibles that of the identity of thought- will-activity, which also applies both to God and to man: human knowledge is creative knowledge, similar to Divine creative knowledge. This interpretation of Maimonides' words is very problematical, primarily in light of Guide 111:21 (cited below). 23. Ibid., p. 198. 24. Ibid. 25.

In Halakhic Man, p. 162, n. 138, Soloveitchik refers directly to Maimon's commentary to Guide 1:68. It is likely that S. Maimon's influence was mediated via H. Cohen's writings. See below on Soloveitchik's relationship to Cohen. 32. It is interesting to note that in the essay, "Majesty and Humility," p. 28, the doctrine of the unity of intellect and intelligibles was attributed to cosmic man (i.e., majestic man, or "Adam the first" in "Lonely Man of Faith"), and not to the utmost of halakhic man, (and here Soloveitchik even notes explicitly the Aristotelian source of this theory!): "The old Aristotelian and Maimonidean theorem about the unity of the subject-knower and the object of inquiry, gives man the credentials of cosmic citizenship." We may surmise that Soloveitchik was well aware of his turn from the original Maimonidean idea, in his other writings. 33. On the parallel on this question between R. Hayyim of Volozhin and R. Shneur Zalman of Lyady, see Soloveitchik's "On the Love of Torah and the Redemption of the Generation" (Heb.), Be-sod hay-Yahid veha-Yahad, (Jerusalem, 1976), p. 410. R. Shneur Zalman's on this question was also quoted in Halakhic Man, p. 26. (Heb.: p. 33). 34. R. Hayyim of Volozhin, Nefesh ha-Hayyim, IV:8. 35. Idem., Ruah Hayyim, I:1, p. 10. Cf.: Lamm, Torah li-shemah, pp. 172-173. 36. Nefesh ha-Hayyim, IV:10. The latter passage was also quoted by Soloveitchik as an example of his conception concerning the cleaving to God by "unification of the intellect with the divine idea" ("On the Love of Torah .. ," op. cit., 410). 37. See Lamm, Torah li-shemah, p. 83. 38. "U-viqqastem mis-sam," p. 130. 39. Kant's distinction between intellectus archetypus and intellectus ectypus repre- sents the limit-concept of an infinite intellect, towards which congition strives and in which the intellect and its object would be united. This limit can never be attained. 40. "Mah dodekh mid-dod," p. 76. 41. "U-viqqastem mis-sam," p. 126. 42. "Lonely Man of Faith," p. 19. Precisely the man of religion (in the essay, Halakhic Man) and "Adam the second" (in "Lonely Man of Faith") are the ones to seek reality-in-itself-a goal which modern scientific man has given up [in light of which one must question the comment in Soloveitchik's On Repentance, ed. Pinhas H. Peli (Jerusalem, 1980), p. 147]. Truly scientific knowledge, even though it does not grant cleaving to or union with God and the world, also manifests human quest for God. However, this sort of quest serves only as one moment in the dialectical process of the religious consciousness (in "U-viqqastem mis-sam"), but it is inadequate to create the synthesis of halakhic man. 43.

We cannot know the world itself, but we can know it as the domain for the realization of the halakhah; we cannot know the inner teleology of the world, but we encounter the very existence of the world as a manifestation of God's ethical creativity (see below); we cannot solve the problem of suffering and evil, the meaning of the given history, but we can know where it should be directed (see "Qol dodi dofeq," pp. 65 ff.). In the final analysis: "When God reveals Himself to man, He does so not for the sake of the realization of a scientific intellectual goal-to relate to him the cosmic drama-but in order to give him laws and regulations" ("U-viqqastem mis-sam," p. 146). 54.

In the later phase of his thought, Cohen revealed the unique character of religion in the status it gives to the individual, and not only to universal humanity, as in ethics. 80. In this context, they both explain the strong connection between the de- velopment of individual selfhood and the question of free will and the autonomy of the human spirit. Compare on this point Rabbi Soloveitchik: "The eudaemo- nistic ideal (the search for happiness), which serves for Aristotle as the highest ethical good, cannot inspire man to create . . . The concept of creation has its roots in the Halakhah, and from there it was transferred by Maimonides to the domain of philosophy . . . as an act of self-creation and self-renewal . . . The concept of creation sheds a clear light on the fundamental principle of choice and free will.. . Man is free to create himself ... The complete freedom of the man of God is embodied in his perception of the norm as an existential law of his own individual and spiritually independent being; he discovers his freedom in the halakhic principle, which is deeply rooted in his pure soul" (Halakhic Man, pp. 133-136 [109-110]). Hermann Cohen: "Die Eudaemonie ist der Zielpunkt der Aristotelischen Ethik."; "Es ist eine bestechende Illusion, das der einsame Denker in seiner Eudaemonie am sichersten zum Selbst ausreifen konne ... Maimuni bestimmt den Begriff der Selbstvervollkommnung ... der Vervollkommnung zum Selbst ... Das ist aber ein groser Sieg der judischen Ethik, den Maimuni herbeifiihrt, das er die Zweideutigkeit der Eudaemonie abzuten und an ihre Stelle denjenigen Begriff zu setzen vermochte, im welchem die wissenschaftliche Ethik allezeit das Problem der Willensfreiheit diskutierte: das autonome ethische Selbstbewustsein" ("Charakteristik, etc.", op. cit., pp. 263, 275-277). Truly, Cohen speaks about infinite ethical perfection, while Soloveitchik speaks of the effort to renew one's own personality in the image of halakhic man and of the prophet; while Cohen refers to "autonomous ethical self-consciousness," Soloveitchik speaks of the supreme commandment which unites with self-con- sciousness at the pinnacle of the ladder of ascension of the religious personality (see above). One may not ignore the differences between these approaches and the contexts in which they were expressed. However, the points of similarity are clear. 81. Halakhic Man, p. 129. 82. Cohen, op. cit., p. 261; Soloveitchik, "U-viqqastem mis-sam," pp. 202-203. 83. Ibid., p. 240 (Even-Shmuel follows Cohen's interpretation). It is interesting to note that where the term "good" is associated with the attributes of action ("I will pass all my goodness before you"), Cohen criticizes the German translation, "all meine Schone": "The word 'good' does not signify beauty" (Religion of Reason, IV: 14. 84. See "Lonely Man of Faith," p. 15, fn.; "Confrontation," Tradition, Vol. 6, no. 2 (1964), p. 10. 85. In addition to the question of the general interpretation of Maimonides' teaching, there is a textual question here: Maimonides opened Guide 1:2 by relating the term "Gods" in the verse, "You shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil" [Gen. 3:5] to judges and political leaders. Is the domain appropriate for 185</page><page sequence="30">A viezer Ravitzky judges and leaders the aesthetic or the moral one? Truly, in terms of Soloveitchik's own thought, the aesthetic realm may include the entire world of "Majestic Man" -i.e., "Adam the first" (see "Lonely Man of Faith," p. 15), that is-the entire world of human culture, including that of political and judicial leadership. However, it is difficult to accept this as an interpretation of Maimonides' text. One must also question this in light of Soloveitchik's own remarks in "Confronta- tion," pp. 7-9, in which the aesthetic stage of "knowledge of good and evil" is understood as a primary, pre-cognitive natural stage, preceding that of majesty. See also the article, "Catharsis," Tradition, Vol. 17, No. 2 (1978), pp. 41-42. 86. Cohen, "Charakteristik, etc." p. 247. Cohen bases "the service of God" upon ethics. 87. Ibid., p. 248. This criticism was directed against Immanuel Joel. 88. On Repentance, op. cit., pp. 81-82. Soloveitchik mentions this in connection with the conceptual distinction between the performance of the commandment and its fulfillment-qiyyum (while this differs from the context in Cohen's discus- sion, immediately thereafter he goes over to the question of the love of God in Maimonides). 89. L. Kaplan has already noted the need to correct this remark in light of recent scholarship. Our concern here is the relationship to Hermann Cohen. 90. In Cohen's work, Ethik des reinen Willens, ethics is presented as the tran- scendental hypothesis of law. Just as epistemology reveals the hypothesis under- lying the natural sciences, so does ethics reveal the hypothesis underlying legal science. 91. Cohen learned halakhah in his youth, but Judaism is more often portrayed in his writings within the context of prayer and messianism than it is in terms of Torah study in the halakhic sense. 92. Halakhic Man, p. 89. I interpret it this way despite Soloveitchik's note on p. 86, distinguishing between the position of the halakhah, on the one hand, and that of Kant and Cohen, on the other. 93. See note 70, above. 94. "Mah dodekh mid-dod," p. 78. This demand is presented as parallel to that of scientific man for the autonomy of mathematical cognition. 95. But see above and following on the relationship between theonomy and autonomy. 96. See: Sinai Oko, "Hermann Cohen and his Religious Thought" (Heb.), introduction to the Hebrew translation of The Religion of Reason: Dat ha-Tevunah mi-meqoroth ha-Yahadut, (Jerusalem, 1974), pp. 9-10. 97. Soloveitchik compares the halakhah to the mathematical sciences, in seeking an archetype of conceptual theoretical cognition; Cohen connects ethics and law, in seeking the transcendental hypothesis of legal science. 98. Cohen, the liberal, evaluates halakhic rules as means towards ethical per- fection. Soloveitchik, the halakhic man, evaluates the halakhah on its own terms. This is the distinction between teleological ethics and deontic ethics. 99. To conclude the discussion of this "Platonism," one should note: the path of the Aristotelian philosopher who seeks the logos and essence of the cosmos is closed to us. However, the path of the Platonic philosopher, who seeks the concept, the pure idea preceding concrete reality, is not closed. From the moment that the halakhah was interpreted as an idea (See: "the ideal image of reality"), 186</page><page sequence="31">Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge from the point at which it "brought the concept in place of fact, ideal contents instead of concrete objects," the way for idealist, a-priori cognition was opened. See below on the correspondence between the Platonic idea and the Kantian cate- gory in Cohen (note 113 below). 100. God is the guarantor that nature will exist as a substrate for the realization of morality. 101. Reason makes infinite progress on two different paths: 1. towards the idea of existence (knowledge of the "is"); 2. towards the idea of justice (the "ought"). 102. H. Cohen, Ethik des reinen Willens (1914), p. 427. Cf.: N. Rotenstreich, Jewish Thought in Modern Times (New York, 1968), pp. 52 ff. 103. Cohen's comments concerning the phrase, "He who renews in His good- ness," (Religion of Reason, 111:13-11:15 [pp. 67-70]) were not meant to ascribe ethical significance to the very existence of the world, as such, but to God's guarantee that there will exist a world as a platform for ethical realization. 104. Ibid., VI: 2 [p. 95].

One may ask whether this corresponds to what was said in "Lonely Man of Faith," pp. 30-31, concerning the impersonal story of heaven, not directed towards man, in contrast with revelation and covenant. It would seem that a change took place in Soloveitchik's conception concerning the nature of cosmic experience and cosmic knowledge. 110. Being also directs man towards faith, not through logical demonstration, but through the cosmic experience and the metaphysical urge. See: "U-viqqastem mis-sam," p. 131. 111. Ibid., p. 225. 112.

As the cosmos alludes to the halakhah by its very being, rather than by its specific nature and laws, the above analogy to the approach of Maimonides is improper. Maimonides drew a connection between the inner lawfulness and teleology of the components of reality, on the one hand, and the Torah, on the other, and not between the very fact of being and the Torah. 126. We find here a surprising echo of Diesendruck's interpretation of tele- ology in Maimonides' thought, requiring a separate, detailed discussion. See: Z.
