<plain_text><page sequence="1">Where the Future Doesn't Come From: On the Logic of Naturoids Massimo Negrotti The best qualification of a prophet is to have a good memory. G. S. Halifax (1633-1695) Towards a General Framework for the Design of Naturoids Throughout the whole history of human technology, one of man's most persistent ambitions has been that of reproducing natural objects, systems, and processes. In order to understand the real possi bility of such technological attempts to approximate natural systems, including the human body itself, we would need to discover what common construction rules, power, and constraints characterize them, irrespective of the technological fields within which they are designed. The term "naturoid" introduced here refers to all devices that are designed with natural objects in mind, by means of materials and building procedures that differ from those that nature adopts. The field of naturoids includes humanoids, animoids, plan toids, and organoids, but also many other classes of objects or processes, such as artificial stones, grass, flavors, odors, light, land scapes, and so on. The technological field of naturoids is sufficiently extensive to make interesting the search for the common features that underlie the very heterogeneous devices that arise within it. This becomes more important if one considers that, as a matter of fact, designers and scientists working in the several sub-fields of the whole field of naturoids generally do not communicate with one another. For example, bioengineers have no serious contact with artificial intel ligence researchers; roboticists have no serious interest in the work of designers of, say, artificial skin; and designers working in fields devoted to emulating natural phenomena such as flavors, perfumes, snow, or landscapes relate only occasionally with the materials scien tists; and so forth and so on. This partially explains why, working in their more or less narrow field, designers of naturoids often tend to predict future scenarios for their products that are completely unfounded. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that they neglect, or ignore, some of the constraints possibly already encountered by designers in other fields that are implied by a given naturoid design. To state it differently, our assumption is that there are no fields in which the advancements in naturoid design can approxi mate nature more easily than in others, because the main difficulties ? 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Design Issues: Volume 24, Number 4 Autumn 2008</page><page sequence="2">1 H.

Kurzweil, The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology (New York: Penguin Press, 2005). are of a general methodological kind, and are not due to any special features of the natural objects that are to be reproduced. Therefore, the general strategies, bottlenecks, and constraints encountered in the more-advanced fields may light the way for the progress of less advanced ones. A particular and very well-known case is that of advanced artificial objects aimed at reproducing human abilities (e.g., artifi cial intelligence and anthropomorphic robotics). Naturoids in these fields often are said to have the intrinsic destiny of exceeding the role of humans in a wide range of situations?see the well-known theses by Hans Moravec,1 Bill Joy,2 and Raymond Kurzweil,3 among others?or of setting up a sort of (rather vaguely defined) symbiosis with them. In other words, the story would run as follows: in the first phase, humans will design and build naturoids; then, in the second phase, these artificial devices, for a number of reasons?such as their intrinsic power (for instance, in reasoning or in self-regulating tasks), their complexity, their continuous enhancement, and so on?will develop, both as individuals and as a "community," characterized by an autonomous decision-making capacity, setting up a sort of superior social class that will dominate the world, and far exceeding human capabilities. Such predictions assume, without any currently available evidence, that the advancements of naturoids will progress towards a growing similarity with natural objects or systems?that is to say, converging ever more closely towards their features. This paper aims at presenting a framework capable of describ ing the methodological steps that, as a rule, any design of naturoids must follow. From this framework, it is possible to grasp the logical reasons that explain why a given naturoid is intrinsically unable to develop towards the natural object or system that inspires it. As a consequence, the same framework will make clear why, neither now nor in the future, there could not be any competition between natural systems, human beings included, and artificial ones. For the reasons outlined above, the search for a common framework within the fields of naturoids cannot be pursued by plac ing ourselves in a particular field and staying there, but rather by trying to understand what is common to all the attempts at designing naturoids, which is an activity to which human beings have dedi cated a great proportion of their technological history. Nevertheless, apart from Herbert Simon's well-known essay of 1969, The Sciences of the Artificial, which aimed to depict the process of design, and not to define the artificial in itself, there are no well-established schools of thought on this issue. Indeed, most scholars neglect this problem, being inclined to conceive as artificial everything that is made by man, although Simon himself reserves the adjective "synthetic" for referring to the cases in which technology tries to cope with nature.

The Ancient Dream of Rebuilding Nature From at least the time of the Renaissance, with the publication of Leon Battista Alberti and Piero della Francesca's Artificial Perspective, there has been a rather vague understanding of the dichotomy that underlies technology. Therefore, the term "naturoid" is intended to establish a standard meaning, referring to any "artificiar' (in the traditional sense) object or device that is aimed at reproducing some thing natural by making use of materials and procedures that differ from those that nature adopts. Historically, we may distinguish between a technology that aims at producing something ex novo, and another that aims at repro ducing something already existing. A starting definition of a natur oid, therefore, should be based on a necessary condition (a naturoid should be made by man) and a sufficient one. (A naturoid must be intended to reproduce something existing in nature.) These simple remarks justify a study of what artificial things?specifically naturoids?are, and particularly the logical and methodological steps and constraints involved in designing natur oids in a given field. In following such a research path, it is possible to discover that the unavoidable result of the technology of naturoids is the trans figuration of the natural objects or systems it aims at reproducing, and not their more and more accurate reproduction. On the other hand, this does not mean in any way that the transfigured performances of naturoids necessarily will exceed those of the natural object, but only that the performances exhibited by a naturoid always will be differ ent?often very different?being perhaps enhanced, or equivalent, or reduced, as compared to those of the natural object or system. Moreover, there is a need for a clear understanding of the concepts at stake. In the history of the debate on artificial intelligence, for instance, both supporters and opponents have been engaged in defining and defending a suitable or "true" concept of "intelligence," while neglecting the adjective "artificial" and its possible universal features that need to be conceptualized. In fact, if one tries to exam ine every human attempt to reproduce natural things or events, one discovers that such an effort exhibits general rules and constraints that are independent of the field of application. First of all, we should remember that the ambition to repro duce natural objects by following strategies that differ from natural ones is very ancient. Examples of naturoids, be they real or purely imagined, abound in history, from the culture of the ancient Greeks to the well-known automata of the eighteenth century and beyond. On the other hand, as stated by D. J. de Sol?a Price: "Our history, then, begins with the deep-rooted urge of man to simulate the world about him through the graphic and plastic arts. The almost magical, naturalistic rock paintings of prehistoric caves, the ancient grotesque figurines and other 'idols' found in burials, testify to the ancient origin of this urge in primitive religion."4 28 Design Issues: Volume 24, Number 4 Autumn 2008</page><page sequence="4">5 R.

Negrotti The Theory of the Artificial (Exeter, UK: Intellect Books, 1999). Therefore, the technology of naturoids is an extension of man's inclination to imitate nature; both for practical reasons and as a challenge to himself. This type of technology has developed along with conventional technology, which aims at controlling the world without any pretence of reproducing it?a technology that exploits scientific knowledge in order to build objects which have no examples in the natural world. Man's ambition to reproduce the world has the function, presumably, of reinforcing his self-confidence and his desire to domi nate nature by exhibiting the ability to obtain the same results via different means; that is to say through what rightly have been termed "alternative realizations."5 Designing Naturoids: Three Basic Steps One major objective of a study of naturoids as a general class should be to outline both the methodological steps that every designer must follow, although often unconsciously, and the logical constraints he always will encounter during his work. The result of this analysis is a set of three processes of selection (or, in some cases, deliberate construction) that cannot be avoided. These are: (a) the selection of an observation level, (b) the selection of an exemplar, and (c) the selec tion of an essential performance.6 The "observation level" (OL) is a profile or a perspective of reality (for instance, microscopic or macroscopic, mechanical or electrical, chemical or biological, informational or physiological), which human beings unavoidably assume when they relate to real ity, and still more so when they describe it. This term is, in some measure, similar to others, such as "description level" or "abstraction level," which are common in the scientific methodology, and to the philosophical concept of abschattung (profile) proposed in 1928 by E. Husserl in his Vorlesungen. The preference for the term "observation" is due to the fact that, at least in principle, every attempt to artificially reproduce a natural object existing in nature requires, of course, an ability to observe it. In fact, even in the cases in which we cannot directly observe any corresponding objects, such as in the fields of artificial intelligence and artificial life, we try to find observable phenomena from which it might be possible to infer the features of the objects or processes that lie at the core of our research. Needless to say, the observation process and the role of the observer are very crucial concepts which have been discussed frequently, particularly in the twentieth century, in almost all disci plines ranging from physics to sociology. However, for our purposes, it will be sufficient to assume the observation process in its most simple and classical sense: that is to say, in the sense it actually is interpreted by scientists and designers when they decide to look at something macroscopic in the natural world in order to give an empirical description of it. Design Issues: Volume 24, Number 4 Autumn 2008 29</page><page sequence="5">There is ample evidence to suggest that human beings cannot take into account more than one OL at any given time. The reduc tive role of adopting a certain OL, just by cutting away other levels, allows significant observations by enabling us to bring something to the foreground, while leaving all remaining levels of reality in the background. This is a useful and, at the same time unavoidable, strat egy?and one that is due to our own nature?but, as such, it prevents us from considering all of the features of any given phenomenon. It is worthy of note that the sciences themselves are built on the basis of separate OLs, and no serious success has yet been reached, either theoretically or practically, to synthesize them into a whole. Even when two sciences relate to each other in an interdisci plinary way, the final result?albeit an infrequent one?is the setting up of a new science based on a new OL. This happens, for instance, in biophysics, which nobody would expect to produce fundamental biological or physical discoveries but, rather, new knowledge on a properly defined biophysical OL. Therefore, the attempt to synthe size two OLs gives rise to a third one, which develops from a partial overlapping of the two OLs concerned, and then assumes its own conceptual, descriptive, and lexical autonomy. When we apply the foregoing considerations to the design of naturoids, we discover a rather general rule: whatever the natural object to be reproduced, researchers and designers have some image or model of it in mind, strongly dependent on the adopted OL. In other words, models cannot capture the whole complex of the empir ical reality they are intended to represent. Therefore, an expression such as: "Here we are trying to build an artificial flower" has little meaning until the designer declares at which OL the natural flower is conceptualized and described (physiological, anatomical, architec tural, mechanical, chemical, aesthetical, etc.)?it being excluded right from the start that the flower could be rebuilt in its entirety; that is to say, according to all the possible OLs. The "exemplar" (EM) must be understood as the natural object, system, or process that one aims to reproduce (e.g., heart, muscles, intelligence, snow, flavors, and so on). Even here, the human propensity to separate things induces us to see the world as a collection of EMs. In fact, a major methodological constraint is due to the arbitrariness of any given "definition" (in the early Latin sense of "fixing the boundaries") of an EM. For instance, an animal that lives symbiotically with another cannot easily be "defined," just as intelligence cannot easily be separated from other mental faculties, nor an organ from its organism, nor even a pond from its surround ing ground. Sciences themselves are very well "defined," and their boundaries, though not formal, usually are strongly defended against intruders from other fields and from the generic, "common-sense" environment.

Campbell Conrad Technologies Inc., Design and Development of a Skate That Simulates Carved Alpine Ski Turns Off-Snowi Abstracts from the 4th International Conference on the Engineering of Sport, September 3-6, 2002, Kyoto, Japan). To sum up, EMs are static or dynamic portions of the empiri cal reality, more or less accurately conceptualized, which we isolate from their context and give them a name and a set of features. Clearly, even here the designers of naturoids have to make serious decisions that largely depend upon the selected OL. Furthermore, given an OL, every definition of an EM?be it topological, anatomi cal, functional, systemic, or whatever?may cut off structures or relations whose exclusion from the model will not only reduce the power of the naturoid in emulating the EM but, more important, may introduce qualities or behavior in the naturoid that are quite nonexistent in the EM itself. An "essential performance" (EP), finally, is the feature, func tion, property, or quality that, according to some more or less shared cultural or scientific OL and paradigm, unambiguously individuates a particular EM. The pumping of the heart, certain functions attrib uted to a gland, this or that faculty of intelligence: all are instances of performances that could be conceived as essential, perhaps accord ing to different schools of thought or cultural models. The expression "essential performance" sometimes appears spontaneously even in scientific accounts, such as in the following report on the design of artificial joints: "It is assumed that the essential performance require ments for an artificial finger joint are: stability, ability to carry up to 30 lbs., ability to allow a deflection of at least 30 degrees, production of the minimum of wear debris."7 A similar meaning is assumed in the following project for a skate simulating ski turns: "Essential performance characteristics are identified relating to six design requirements that are necessary to accurately reproduce a carved turn off-snow. The requirements include specifications to ensure a replication of pure carving, range of motion, turning relationship, balance, robustness, and safety."8 EPs, in turn, depend upon the selected OL and on the defini tion of the EM: an aspect that seems essential from a given OL may not seem to be so from another and a given aspect may be included or excluded according to the boundaries of the EM we have decided to establish. This also introduces a remarkable "relativity" in the final design of any naturoid, because its real configuration always will appear as one of the innumerable profiles of the natural instance. This set of steps?that is to say, the selection of an OL, an EM, and an EP?cannot but apply to all naturoid-designing activity; and it involves a logic of self-including selection because the definition of an EP depends on the definition of an EM, and both depend on the selected OL. The arbitrariness of this funnel-like process is one of the reasons why no naturoid may be expected to reproduce the whole of even the seemingly simplest natural object or process.

Inside the Complexity of Naturoids We also should point out that the need, by definition, to adopt differ ent materials from those that nature adopts contributes to giving the naturoid its own "nature." Designers of naturoids are attracted by materials that, by virtue of some of their properties, appear to be the right ones for reproducing the EP of the selected EM. Thus, before and independent from the rise of a specialized "material science," Jacques de Vaucanson, concerned with the reproduction of the diges tive tract of a duck in the eighteenth century, was attracted by the newly discovered Indian rubber. In the same way, a contemporary bioengineer has said that "life-saving heart surgery often relies on a polymer originally developed for women's fashions or a plastic meant for insulating electrical wires."9 However, the selected materials, in themselves, normally have nothing to do with the stuff of the natural EM, as generated by its own natural evolution. More important, the selected materials appear on the scene of the naturoid with all of their properties, and not just with the "right" ones, as designers tacitly and understand ably are inclined to hope. In other words, reality is not tailored to our specific needs, and we cannot simply choose the properties we desire, as if they were individual packets on a supermarket shelf. This sort of "inheritance principle" explains why sudden events and side-effects characterize the life of almost all naturoids. Indeed, undesigned relations among the adopted materials, or between them and the hosting environment, can generate unexpected features or events that become part of the overall transfiguration of the EM and of its natural EPs. We also must consider how problematic it would be, from both a logical and an operational point of view, to put to work together two or more "partial" naturoids, whose EMs have been drawn from a complete system (such as, for instance, two subsys tems of a biological organism). We are led to support the hypothesis that, if one aimed to reproduce a larger natural system than previously designed natur oids had been able to reproduce as standalone devices, such an attempt would result in an unmanageable project. This is due to the fact that each of the standalone naturoids is built in its own area on the basis of its own OL, and, furthermore, by adopting ad hoc mate rials. This would imply that, in order to functionally connect two partial naturoids, we must decide which "language" they will adopt in relating each other. When designers do so, they are much more orientated towards obtaining the final result at any cost, rather than discovering what "language" is adopted by the natural system. In contrast, a natural system that includes two natural subsystems is the result of a combination of at least two distinct OLs?possibly giving rise to a new, third level, with its own rules and properties. Such rules and properties, although they are needed to bring about the particular behavior of the system, are not easily 32 Design Issues: Volume 24, Number 4 Autumn 2008</page><page sequence="8">10 D. Dennett, Brainchildren: Essays on Designing Minds (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press and Penguin, 1998). 11 A. Prokop, "Bioartificial Organs in the Twenty-first Century: Nanobiological Devices," Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 944:1 (2001 ): 472-490. recognizable in the standalone EMs, precisely because these EMs, both as objects and as models, are the result of a sort of extraction of a part from the whole system at some OLs. The very complex relationship between touch and sight, and between the related coor dinating structures and processes, illustrates this point. On the other hand, trying to reproduce the larger system by entering a third OL would entail giving up the work done at the previous ones, and setting up a whole new project; with a new OL, EM, and EP. Objecting to this point would entail relying on a bottom-up strategy, which is very difficult to defend in the field of naturoids as well as in other areas. The same could be said for so-called "reverse engineering,"10 because, sooner or later, this involves deciding what is relevant. For the designers of naturoids, the difficulty is due to the ever-decreasing probability of getting a reliable and natural behavior from a cumulative structure of partial naturoids, which are unlikely devices in themselves. In turn, the inherited properties and perfor mances of the adopted materials?which would include undesigned relationships between the materials themselves, and between the materials and the context?would grow exponentially with the addi tion of new materials. An interesting corollary to this argument is that the concept of "replication" (the tacit dream of every designer of naturoids) is the exact opposite of the concept of "naturoid"?that is to say, of an artificially reconstructed natural EM. Indeed, a replication would be possible if, and only if, one were able to reproduce an EM accord ing to all of its possible OLs, and capturing all of its EPs without privileging any of them, while adopting, of course, the same mate rials that nature adopts. Only nature is able to do this, since it is completely self-sufficient ("autopoietic") in generating its own struc tures. For man?with the exception of genetic cloning, which is a quite different matter?replication is possible only when, as in the case of software development, we must deal with formal realities whose particularity is to exhibit just one, intentionally constructed OL?namely, in the case of software, information. A different, very insightful strategy is that of the so-called bio-artificial technology, which provides artificial scaffolds that are able to help the natural structures (e.g., cells) perform correctly. This strategy does not necessarily aim at designing naturoids that are able to replace a system as a whole, but to provide an artificial assistance device to enable it to perform its natural function. Nevertheless, advancements in this field may lead to a new sub-field of true natur oid technology particularly at a microscopic OL.11 In principle, both for a standalone naturoid and, a fortiori, for a cumulative one, we must expect a range of potential performances that is far from that exhibited by the natural EM.

[Accessed, March 2005.] fact that the naturoid is made of materials that are not those of the natural EM does not imply, as such, that it will be a less complex portion of reality: its richness may well be on a par with, or superior to, that of the EM although different in quality. The "principle of emergence"12 often is invoked by design ers in the hope that the right EP of the naturoid?the one that was selected as essential from the natural EM?might appear sponta neously from the right architecture; that is to say, just by putting together partial artificial devices. Surely, such a principle always will be active, because something new always emerges when putting separate things together. Nevertheless, there is a high probability of finding completely new performances that are far from those exhib ited by the natural EM as it has evolved. Ultimately, a transfiguration of the EM and of its performances, as generated by every naturoid, is unavoidable. More formally, we could say that the advances in the repro duction of the EP of a given EM?normally achieved with further refinements of models, but also with the addition of conventional techniques and materials?implies the emergence of an ever-increas ing set of actual or potential performances that are not matched in the EM. This, in turn, implies that, as the sum of the nature-like performances of a naturoid increases in its range, it is destined to represent an ever-decreasing proportion of the set of its possible new and undesigned performances. This fact may involve further and serious transfigurations of the EPs themselves. Incidentally, the above considerations outline the roots of the so-called incompatibility that a naturoid usually exhibits, not only at a bioengineering level, but whenever it has to work in a natural environment. Rather than engaging in further theoretical considerations, it seems meaningful at this point to quote from a report on the building of artificial wetlands, which states: "Concerns revolve around such issues as the complexity of reproducing natu ral systems, the difficulty of measuring the success of man-made wetlands, the ability to mimic wetland functions such as flood control or water quality improvement, the extent that aquatic life will utilize the sites, and long-term success."13 The Welcome Deceit of Naturoids As far as the success of a naturoid is concerned, another general rule almost always applies. Putting to work the key concepts we have introduced here, we may say that a naturoid will be accepted as a success if and only if those who judge it: A. Place themselves at the same OL as that selected by the designers B. Establish the boundaries of the EM in the same way that designers did, and, C. Agree on the EP that the designers have attributed to the EM. 34 Design Issues: Volume 24, Number 4 Autumn 2008</page><page sequence="10">14 G.

After all, this is a very well-known limit in bioengineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, and all the other fields of naturoids. In a way that is somewhat similar to the classical intellectual expedient of scientists when they adopt the ceteris paribus clause, artificialists, too, must rely upon the possibility that "all things remain equal" when they put a naturoid to work in the real world. In the case of pharmacology, which is among the most devel oped of artificialistic fields, is very instructive in this regard. In fact, sudden events and side-effects are the greatest challenge for phar macologists?much more so, probably, than for other scientists and conventional technologists in general. It is important to note that the success of a naturoid has two faces. One, as mentioned above, regards the scientific community or, in many cases, the general public: but another always will be the "organism," or the context or the environment within which the naturoid will be placed. In the end, it is the real judge of the replace ment of one of its components by means of the naturoid because it "knows all the things" involved and needed for its correct function ing. In fact, sudden events or side-effects coming from naturoids reveal the nature of the "deceit" (hopefully a good one, of course), so to speak, which is intrinsic to the naturoid. One of the leading pioneers of the artificial kidney and artificial heart, Professor Willem Kolff of the Kolff Labs in Salt Lake City, emphasized in a personal communication in 1995 that the function of an artificial heart is essentially to "cheat the body" in the sense that the body has to be persuaded that blood comes from a natural heart. This is the real aim of all naturoids: they are projects based on a sort of generalized Turing test. This is not entirely a novelty of the twentieth century. For example, Cornelio Agrippa reported in the sixteenth century that, in a match between the two Greek painters Zeusi and Parrasio, "Zeusi draws grapes which deceive the sparrows ... Parrasio draws a drapery which simulates so carefully a breadth of cloth, spread to cover a painting, that he cheated his competitor."14 Similarly, Nicolas Negroponte has reported that, in the 1970s, when one of the first teleconferencing systems was designed to improve United States Government emergency procedures, a mechanism was added to reinforce the realism of the message given by the model system: an animated plastic head representing a speaker (for instance, the President). The result was that the "video recordings generated in this way provided so realistic a reproduction that an admiral told me that the 'talking heads' gave him nightmares."15 We should note that the above examples and the many others we could mention describe the story of the "natural effects" of natur oids. Of course, this is a matter of study to be carried out not only in the field of engineering, but also in the natural and social sciences. Design Issues: Volume 24, Number 4 Autumn 2008 35</page><page sequence="11">Again, we cannot expect to obtain from such a study any evidence of a coming supremacy of machines, or proof of a more-than-meta phorical "autonomous development" or "symbiosis" with humans. Rather, we might obtain knowledge regarding the new path to follow for adapting ourselves to technology designed to meet (and in part to dictate) our needs. In so doing, we should clearly keep in mind that machines?and machine systems all the more?need to be governed because they lack any genetic teleology. Therefore, they always tend to degenerate, following purely physical laws and constraints, with out any meta-rule capable of allowing the self-regulation of their individual and collective development. Conclusions: Knowledge over Fear As far as a teleological viewpoint is concerned, human technology follows two, apparently independent paths. Along the first, it is very creative, when, as in the case of conventional technology, it tries to control nature by producing objects, processes, or machines ex nihilo. Along the second, technology tries to reproduce natural EMs and their EPs, by basing the projects on the tools and knowledge provided by conventional technology. Thus, in the field of naturoids, although conventional technol ogy and materials are forced to mimic something natural, they are accompanied by their own intrinsic diversity with respect to nature's means of generating its objects and processes. This fact, along with the selective character of our way of defining natural EMs and EPs?due to the constraints imposed by the selected OLs?always makes naturoids something unavoidably new and different from nature. Nevertheless, no evidence or theoretically well-founded reason can justify a prediction according to which, in the foresee able future, artificial devices?such as robots, AI programs, bio-arti ficial devices, and so on?are destined to exceed the whole range of human abilities. Yet this might come to pass if, and only if, current advancements in the field of naturoids were to exhibit capacities converging towards more and more intrinsically, human-like features; up to and including an autonomous construction of a sort of artificial DNA which might be considered an artificial species, potentially superior to man. Instead, what really happens is that naturoids develop only according to our ability to find technological solutions to the prob lems they face in understanding what we need from them. As the foregoing analysis has tried to show, even the most "intelligent" arti ficial device that exhibits growing autonomous capacity bases this skill on strategies and expedients which, the more they develop, the more they differ from our own, and furthermore without any possi bility of establishing a new species. This implies that we should learn Design Issues: Volume 24, Number 4 Autumn 2008</page><page sequence="12">how to manage our relationships with naturoids when they begin to exhibit behavior for which they were not designed, and instead inter act with each other or with nature according to some unexpected properties. However, among the supposedly possible systemic outcomes of naturoid development, any "joining forces" against human beings has about the same likelihood as a sudden, undesigned act of jeal ousy by a robot; or of a spontaneous self-reproduction process in artificial grass. On the other hand, something new surely will arise from the technology of naturoids. This has happened throughout the whole history of conventional technology, although it may be imperceptible to us because our cultures are coevolving with the technologies we develop. Therefore, as in any case of technological modification of the environment, we should prepare ourselves to carefully study the changes that we are bringing about. After all, the fear of the supremacy of machines over human beings, arising from human-like motivations, is not a new issue even though it has never happened in the past. At the most, it might occur in the form of a dependency that has nothing to do with an intrinsic "will to power" on the part of the various devices we have designed and adopted. Thus, the above supremacy has an unquantifiable probability if we conceive it as a coordinated and motivated outcome. Rather, in the near future, thanks to the unprecedented, highly developed, and complex tech nological systems we are building, we could find ourselves facing a world "apart" and only partially understandable without new, specific theoretical and empirical studies. In the end, we shall accept or reject the outcomes of this "new world" according to its degree of usefulness for our needs, and also, equally important, according to the degree of "beauty" that emerges from the architecture we are able to impose upon it.
