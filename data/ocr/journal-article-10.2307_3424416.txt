<plain_text><page sequence="1">Medical Highlights TOWARD BETTER NUTRITION BEFORE HEART SURGERY Patients with cardiac cachexia-tissue hy- poxia, anorexia, and hypermetabolism- have a high morbidity and mortality rate. Those who need surgery are, therefore, at high risk. A survey of 350 hospitalized patients showed that "50 patients with a primary cardiac diagnosis were significantly mal- nourished." The degree of malnutrition was de- termined by anthropomorphic measure- ments (weight, height, midarm muscle cir- cumference, and triceps skin fold), by determining levels of serum albumin and transferrin, the total iron-binding capacity (to assess status of visceral protein com- partment); and by assessing cell-mediated immunity (by skin testing with Candida and mumps antigen, and by peripheral leukocyte counts). From the findings, a cachexia profile was then prepared for each patient. The malnutrition was treated by first managing patients' congestive heart failure and then providing enough protein, miner- als, electolytes, vitamins, and calories to place patients in positive nitrogen balance. It took two to three weeks of such nutri- tional support to produce clinically signifi- cant improvement in body composition and cardiac function. The oral hyperalimentation program in- cluded "40 kilocalories per kilogram and 1.5-2 Gm. of protein per kilogram per day. ." A regular low-salt, high-protein diet and a "defined formula" were given. When necessary, patients were tube fed. Fourteen of the patients who had far- advanced disease (American Heart Associ- ation Class III and Class IV) were sched- uled for surgery when "visceral protein levels were at least 80 percent of the lower limit of normal and [when] cellular immu- nity was restored." Twelve of the 14 patients had heart valve surgery; 9 sur- vived. Only two of the survivors had had negative skin tests, but four of the five who died had been anergic. Cell-mediated im- munity was restored in three of the most malnourished patients. Postoperatively, patients were given hy- pertonic glucose, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes by vein until they could take appropriate food by mouth.-BLACKBURN, G. L., AND OTHERS.

FEW WOMEN KNOW THEIR FERTILE PERIOD A substantial number of women appar- ently do not know when they are most likely to become pregnant. In 1973 and again in 1974, 358 women, who had had their first children in July of 1970, 1971, or 1972, were asked when during the menstrual cycle a woman was most likely to become pregnant. Less than one half of these women-all urban, all mothers-answered correctly. A surprisingly large number-47 percent- thought a woman was most apt to become pregnant "right before" the menstrual period; another 22 percent said they didn't know, only 33 percent gave correct responses at both interviews. The older the women were at the first interview and the better educated, the more likely they were to give correct answers. Only 10 percent of those under 21 answered correctly, as compared to 58 percent of those over 24; only 9 percent of those who were not high school graduates answered correctly, but 56 percent of women who had at least one year of college did so. Eleven percent of the black women answered correctly both times; 48 percent of the white women. This difference may have been related to greater access to correct information on the part of white women. However, "classroom discussions of contraception, attendance at family planning clinics, and discussions with one's mother . . . are not positively associated with knowledge about pregnancy risk," in either black or white women. From the data it would seem that the women who were more knowledgeable about time of pregnancy risk were those who were not using the pill or IUD's, "per- haps because they. . . [had] greater need to know."-PRESSER, H. B. Guessing and misinformation about pregnancy risk among urban mothers. Fam.Plann.Per- spect. 9:111-115, May-June 1977. SKIP FLU SHOTS THIS YEAR? A well-known virologist believes that influ- enza vaccine should now be given only during pandemics when there are totally new and highly virulent influenza viruses "for which almost the entire world popula- tion has no immunity ... " This advice is based on three recent unexpected findings. First, deaths from penumonia, which increased during every influenza A epidemic up to 1970, stopped increasing during the last five years, and even decreased in the 1975. and 1976 epidemics. Second, mortality from such high-risk illnesses as cardiac disease, bronchitis, em- physema, asthma, diabetes, chronic ne- phritis, and tuberculosis did not increase after the 1968-1969 pandemic and showed a continuing decrease regardless of later influenza A epidemics. Third, a large study reported in 1976 by the Center for Disease Control showed that "only a small proportion of bed disability attributed to clinical influenza . . . is caused by the influenza A and B viruses, even during epidemic years."- SABIN, A. B. Mortality from pneumonia and risk conditions during influenza epidemics. JAMA 237:2823-2828, June 27, 1977.

In order to determine whether ultra- violet irradiation gives relief or not, 10 patients on hemodialysis, who had had pruritis for at least two months, were treated with ultraviolet light twice a week for a total of eight exposures. All medica- tions as well as the dialysis were continued. Eight similar patients were treated with "placebo phototherapy," using Sylvania Lifeline bulbs, which give light similar in brightness and heat to the ultraviolet light used for treatment, but have no biologic effect in the dosage used. The two groups of patients were ran- domly assigned to the ultraviolet and to the placebo phototherapy. The pruritis of 9 of the 10 patients who received ultraviolet irradiation improved; 3 had a recurrence after one to three weeks but responded to a second course of irradiation. Eight of the 10 patients remained free of pruritis for the follow-up period, which averaged 7 months and ranged from 2 to 11 months. One patient died, free of pruritis, and one patient had a recurrence after nine months. Only two of the eight patients who were given placebo therapy improved. Three of the others were then given a course of ultraviolet irradiation and one of these responded. Thus, 10 of 13 patients were helped by ultraviolet irradiation. Ultraviolet therapy is practical. Its effec- tiveness and safety for uremic pruritis needs further study.---GILCHREST, B.A., AND OTHERS. Relief of uremic pruritis with ultraviolet phototherapy. N. Engl.J.Med. 297:136-138, July 21, 1977. WATCH DRINKING WATER EVEN IN U.S. At a national park in 1975, drinking water contaminated with raw sewage caused gas- trointestinal illness in more than 200 park personnel and 2,000 visitors. Visitors were questioned by telephone or mail. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were isolated from the park's water supply and from the stools of 20 of 49 park residents who had the characteristic symptoms: diar- rhea, cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Symp- toms lasted for a median duration of eight days. The positive identification of the organ- ism and its mode of transmission in the Crater Lake National Park epidemic clear- ly identifies enterotoxigenic E.coli or- ganisms as a public health threat in the United States, especially when "water quality and food sanitation are inade- quate." "Ninety-nine outbreaks involving 16,950 cases of waterborne illness were reported to the Center for Disease Control from 1971 to 1974 ... " For nearly half (47 percent) of those outbreaks, no causal organism was found.-ROSENBERG, M. L. Epidemic diarrhea at Crater Lake from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Ann.Int.Med. 86:714-718, June 1977.
