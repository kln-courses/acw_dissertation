<plain_text><page sequence="1">A POSSIBLE ALLUSION IN THOMAS HARDY'S 'GOING AND STAYING" Philip K. Jason Thomas Hardy's notion of cosmic indifference to human striving and values receives characteristic expression in his short poem "Going and Staying." In the first two stanzas, the poet catalogues in turn those phenomena which men find pleasurable and painful, reminding us of the grim irony that the pleasur- able experiences we would wish to last are always "going" while the painful ones stubbornly stay with us. In the closing stanza, Hardy pulls us back from what comes to be understood as the subjective human perspective to insist that Time has no preference, that it eventually sweeps away, with a sort of even-handedness, "Things sinister with things sublime." It is only our human subjectivity that allows us to imagine some kind of malicious torment in the workings of Fate. This understanding of the processes of Time (or Fate) is reinforced by an image that I take to be based on the myth of the Mill of Heaven, known in northern legend as Amlodi's or Hamlet's Mill. In the first stanza, Hardy presents a list of ephemeral beauties and excitements: The moving sun-shapes on the spray, The sparkles where the brook was flowing, Pink faces, plightings, moonlit May, These were the things we wished would stay; But they were going. The second stanza sketches the other side of this psychic dilemma, completing the picture: Seasons of blankness as of snow, The silent bleed of a world decaying, The moan of multitudes in woe, These were the things we wished would go; But they were staying. The implication growing out of these first two stanzas is that this contrast is not simply the appearance of things, but the ultimate truth. Standing by themselves, these stanzas suggest a plan, or at least a willfulness in the workings of Fate, that is antagonistic towards man. These two stanzas did, in fact, stand by themselves when the poem was first published in the London Mercury of November, 1919, giving voice to the collective mood in the aftermath of World War I.1 1 J. O. Bailey, The Poetry of Thomas Hardy: A Handbook and Commentary (Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1970), p. 441. 261</page><page sequence="2">262 / VICTORIAN POETRY The third and last stanza, added when the poem was gathered into Late Lyrics and Earlier (1922), corrects the relatively naive vision of the first two: Then we looked closelier at Time, And saw his ghostly aims revolving To sweep off woeful things with prime, Things sinister with things sublime Alike dissolving. The "closelier" look allows us to throw off our subjective bias and accept the harder truth of Time's indifference. As Albert Pettigrew Elliot has stated, "This consciousness of the Will is one in which the meaninglessness of good and evil, joy and pain is manifest."2 The image of Time, with its revolving arms, is curious. Hardy, of course, could be referring to the hands of a clock or attempting some sort of vague anthropomorphic picture.3 I believe, however, that he is alluding to Hamlet's Mill, that mysterious instrument of remote legend that has a direct connection with time and with heavenly dispensation. This mill is treated in the Kalevala as well as in the writings of Saxo Grammaticus and Snurri Sturluson. Hardy's interest in and use of Druidical, Celtic, Teutonic, and Scandinavian lore has been well established, and it is likely that he was familiar with some version of this myth.4 According to Georgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechand, Amlodi [Hamlet] was identified, in the crude and vivid imagery of the Norse, by the ownership of a fabled mill which, in his own time, ground out peace and plenty. Later, in decaying times, it ground out salt; and now finally, having landed at the bottom of the sea, it is grinding rock and sand, creating a vast whirlpool . . . which is supposed to be a way to the land of the dead. This imagery stands ... for an astronomical process, the secular shifting of the sun through the signs of the zodiac which determines world-ages, each numbering thousands of years. Each age brings a World Era, a Twilight of the Gods. Great structures collapse, pillars topple which supported the great fabric, floods and cataclysms herald the shaping of a new world.5 In all of its versions, the heavenly mill produces periods of time; in Greek mythology it is a constellation under the domain of Chronos. This image, in which Time and Destruction are functions of one another, fits perfectly the intent of Hardy's stanza, and "ghostly arms revolving" could certainly be a description of this legendary mill. Samuel Hynes, in The Pattern of Hardy's Poetry, has noted that interaction of a world of light and a world of darkness is central to Hardy's vision.6 These worlds are clearly evoked in the first two stanzas of "Going and Staying." The third stanza, however, asserts that this duality is simply a ^Fatalism in the Works of Thomas Hardy (1935; rpt. New York, 1966), p. 55. Bailey conjectures "a phantom-like broom," p. 441. This feature of Hardy's work is amply demonstrated in Ruth A. Firor's Folkways in Thomas Hardy (1931; rpt. New York, 1968). b Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time (London, 1970), p. 2. 6Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1961, pp. 110-111.</page><page sequence="3">PHILIP K.

(An "explanation" of the origin of these two worlds may also be found in the legend of the cosmic mill: one special attribute of the mill is that it brings about the separation of heaven and earth.) The mill of time lies behind all change and contrast, and figures appropriately as the closing image in Hardy's poem, signaling an ancient outlook whose determinism is in keeping with Hardy's own. Further- more, the personification of the mill is consistent with Hardy's attitude and method as articulated by Elliot: "In Hardy, Time takes on a new significance as a motif for art, a fatal sway over the lives of men that gives it even vague personality and awe-inspiring immanence in things" (p. 79). Hardy focused on the destructive operations of the mill and on the indifference of Time to man's range of values. He either did not know of or did not choose to incorporate the idea that the destruction of one world-age ushers in the next (although this was certainly the hope upon the conclusion of the war); rather he leaves the reader with what Hynes calls the "solace of disenchantment" (p. 121). The closer look at time that the third stanza of "Going and Staying" affords is significantly deepened by the allusion to Hamlet's Mill.</page></plain_text>
