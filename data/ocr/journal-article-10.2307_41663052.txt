<plain_text><page sequence="1">LURISTAN BRONZES: THEIR STYLE AND SYMBOLISM By Clay Lancaster A native of Lexington, Kentucky, Mr. Lancaster has studied at the University of Kentucky (B.A., 1938; M.A., 1939) and Columbia University . He has taught at V assar College and Kentucky and now is Lecturer in Fine Arts at both Columbia and Cooper Union. Pursuing diversified interests, he has published several articles on American and Oriental art and architecture. Twenty-three twenty Iranian centuries metalcraft years through was ago suddenly the the discovery horizon pushed of prim- back of Twenty-three Iranian metalcraft was suddenly pushed back twenty centuries through the discovery of prim- itive bronzes in the Luristan hills bordering the lower extent of the Tigris River. The finds had been fash- ioned by peoples that antedated and survived into the early period of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. The bronze types were all of a smallish nature, indicating the possessions of nomadic tribesmen, certainly less im- pressive than the larger and more sophisticated con- temporary bronzes of the settled Shang and Chou peo- ple of China (Figure i). Luristan bronzes first appeared on the European market in the spring of 1929; and the demand of western collectors stimulated such an avid search on the part of the eastern natives that the supply was soon exhausted. The Holmes Expedition, sent in 1935 by the American Institute for Iranian Art and Archaeology, had to content itself almost ex- clusively with the excavation of pottery. Among the numerous pieces distributed throughout the museums and private collections of the Middle East, Europe and America, only fifteen Luristan bronzes are datable through inscriptions. These can be grouped within two principal epochs, the first (con- sisting of five) from the twenty-seventh to the twenty- second centuries B.c., and the second (containing nine items) from the mid-twelfth to the mid-ninth centuries B.c., with a concentration in the twelfth century. The pieces have been collated and discussed by Professor Stephen Langdon in the first volume of A Survey of Persian Art (Oxford, 1938), pages 279-285. A single vessel inscribed in old Persian of the time of Darius, a small group of bronzes found with pottery cylin- der seals, and others with items of iron, testify to the persistence of the culture for an additional span of sev- eral centuries, after which it disappears. Casting was the normal production technique employed by the Luristan metal workers. The repoussé method occurs in exceptional instances, mostly during the declining stage. The Luristan bronzes may be divided into two classes according to their uses: the first has to do with physical utilitarian purposes, with hunting, defense, domestic needs, and horse and personal fittings or adornments; the second includes pieces that have no direct practical function, serving instead as instruments of magic or worship. These talismans are highly symbolic. De- signed to be affixed to an elongated base, the forms are composite human and animal units, equally balanced, confronted or addorsed beasts, or anthropomorphic figures clutching or sprouting various feline, horned or winged creatures. Identical motifs appear on some of the everyday items as well, predominantly among the horse accouterments and especially on bit-plaques; in this group only strict symmetry is not always retained. IT through is unfortunate inscriptions that has none sufficient of the ornamental bronzes dated re- through inscriptions has sufficient ornamental re- lief to serve as a guide in fixing a chronology on stylis- tic grounds for the more interesting symbolic bronzes, the fifteen dated pieces being limited to simple con- tainers and weapons. The haphazard manner in which the artifacts were unearthed can throw practically no light on the problem. Yet there seems to be agreement 94 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1.

It would appear that the talis- mans may be subdivided into two periods. The earlier, more vigorous designs, conscious only of the vertical axis, are irregular in outline, having a hollow shaft that penetrates from top to bottom, and through which was passed a bronze pin with ornamental finial connecting the talisman proper to a vase-shaped base with narrow neck rising from a bulbous form that either would rest on a flat surface or fit onto a staff, more likely the latter. The succeeding type is composed within a square, rec- tangular, or circular frame supported on a hollow cyl- inder, the shaft of which is closed where it adjoins the frame. The scheme itself has a tendency to respect a horizontal as well as a vertical axis, or to dispose itself into several panels or registers; and, although re- strained by the geometric enframement, it is more com- plex and jumbled than the first subdivision. Although both were cast, the character of the second suggests Summer 1952 95</page><page sequence="3">some indebtedness to the more lately favored repoussé work. It is noteworthy thatthe considerably later paint- ing in Persia (from about the thirteenth century A.D. onward) progressed from open to closed picture areas and likewise was a manifestation of miniature art. Many affinities of the to the devices motifs on of the Luristan more bronzes mature civil- bear affinities to the motifs of the more mature civil- izations across the rivers to the west and north. Per- haps the Lurs borrowed from their neighbors, or per- haps each descended from similar circumstances. Since the myths of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyri- ans are known to us whereas those of the Lurs are not, there has developed a practice of reading into Luristan forms the characters of foreign legends. For instance, the Luristan figure who wears horns on his head and strangles lions has been called a mergence of Gilga- mesh, the hero-king of Uruk, and of the bull-man En- diku. Griffins or eagles are often substituted for lions; and, minus the horns, the figure may grasp goats or ibexes. To assign borrowed meaning freely without good evidence seems undesirable and unnecessary. It is sufficient that the repetition of motifs in a roughly similar pattern from piece to piece indicates an estab- lished iconography among the Lurs; and the approxi- mate meaning can be deduced from a fairly universal acceptance of symbolism in which the animal kingdom serves to reflect the conflicting forces of the universe, the alternating hegemony of summer and winter, heat and cold, drought and flpod, associated with the com- bat of lion and bull, eagle and deer, griffin and ibex, or of humans acting on behalf of - often wearing the symbols of- these beasts. IT man, is proposed and a repoussé to discuss plaque. an early The and first a late item cast belongs talis- man, and a repoussé plaque. The first item belongs to the vertical-axis type, having an irregular outline (Figure 2). It is 7 13/16 inches high, cast in two parts, and is elevated art additional 6 7/16 inches upon a long-necked hollow base (not illustrated, but similar to that shown in Figure iP), believed to be the orig- inal counterpart inasmuch as both superstructure and base are slightly larger than others that have been ex- amined or published. The pin uniting the assembly is missing, and two thin bars have been broken on one side of the upper portion of the bronze. In common with other talismans of this species, there is an upright figure whose outstretched arms grasp a pair of affronted beasts, the curved bodies of which branch out and upward from the central stem. There is a strict bilateral symmetry, left to right and front to back, which makes the anthropomorphic char- acters bifacial. The differences between various ex- amples are in the number of human heads on the axis, in the quantity and variety of animal parts entering the composition, and in the stiffness or fluidity of the forms and the crudity or refinement of details. The simplest examples seem to represent a hero, having the normal human attributes and holding at bay quite acceptable leonine shapes. Others, such as the bronze here illus- trated, are polycephalic, and can only be interpreted as deities, whose supernatural powers are further indi- cated in terms of composite anatomy and abstractions. Six published examples share with this talisman mul- tiple heads and a flattened lower portion resembling somewhat a human torso and somewhat the rump of a deer. Exaggerated shapes similar to this treatment are to be seen on ancient Iranian mother-goddesses of clay. In two of the half-dozen talismans, the tubes that rise above the flattened shape maintain a fairly constant diameter, whereas those of the others swell and dimin- ish noticeably. All feature a head at the junction of the arc projections which terminate in the gaping jaws of felines, and near their point of contact, hanging down- ward gargoyle fashion, are pairs of cocks' (?) heads. On one the heads of tiny goats, facing out, are attached to the vertical shaft immediately below the birds' heads; another has whole birds here, another quad- rupeds. A single talisman in the Louvre presents the axial figure with three heads. The bronze pictured in Figure 2 is the only example I have seen that repre- sents the Super Being with four heads or with two pairs of arms. The jaws circular and manes projections of lions that indicate they describe by the open the jaws and manes of lions that they describe the blazing sun, which, during the late Persian summer, scorches the crops and dries up the grazing lands, thus lion and sun being alike fiery tempered, powerful, golden in color, and menacing to mankind and flocks. The cocks' heads are in line with this idea; the crowing of the rooster proclaims the coming of the sun. The curve itself suggests a raging, dynamic force. By contrast, the straight, vertical shaft can be only a serene, cool, and constant power, the opponent of the qualities just described. We look for the identification of this symbol in some personification of the night. From the multiplicity of choices, no object better fits the conditions than Polaris, the North Star, the Station- ary, around whom revolve all zodiacal creatures of the firmament. How awe-inspiring this fixed phenomenon must have appeared to the ancient Lur herdsmen, and 96 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 2.

It was this constant denizen of the upper realm to whom the Lur appealed for protection. The multifold heads give the deity an impressive quality intensified by the act of doubled pairs of arms seizing fantastic brutes precipitated in space. The large-nosed, short-bearded faces in all probabil- ity are reasonable facsimiles of those of the Luristan artisans and their associates, their god being created more or less in their own likeness. Thus, on this little image that symbolized and magically contained the essence of the Immovable Polaris were stamped the features of the caster and of the votary, the deity, the maker, and the devotee being one, and - the talisman being polycephalic - at the same time together being many. Except for the astral association, we have from this primitive, nomadic culture of several thousand years ago, the evidence of a fundamental concept of God which by far the vast majority of men today find acceptable - the Great Mechanic of the universe, He who will attend to the well-being of those who call upon Him, superhuman yet human, the Many in the One, his features bearing the familiar physiognomy of those who believe in Him. Because has been it dubbed is highly decadent; stylized, but this in type my of opinion talisman it has been dubbed decadent; but in my opinion it marks the culmination of Luristan bronzecasting, the effete phase manifesting itself in an entirely different way. In this open-form type the iconography reads fairly consistently: the fixed-moon- water-winter sym- bols (Polaris, bull, deer, goat, and other horned ani- mals) are arranged on the upright axis, whereas the raging-sun-fire-summer symbols (lion, bird, etc.) ap- pear on the counter axis. Later, the opposing forces be- come intertwined, obscured, then reconciled - a self- evident indication of decadence. Also, decoration for its own sake plays a more important role in the design. Our representative specimen of this later phase (dating from the eighth to the sixth century b.c.) goes further in its use of symmetry, being equally balanced not only left to right but top to bottom as well (Figure 3) . In other words, one quarter of the rectangle is complete, exhausts the design, and is repeated in the other three quarters of the piece. We distinguish twin masks with Summer 1952 97</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3. Bronze finial of the eighth to sixth centuries b.c., in the collection of the Musee du Louvre. Height 4 3/4 inches. Courtesy of the Louvre, Paris. protruding bovine ears and huge curling horns or fronds that embrace the balance of the motifs. Thus far the iconography is perfectly clear. But arms without shoulders reach out, presumably from the masks, and clutch the figures' own horns. Protomes of meek little beasts (perhaps lions) , with paws or hands identical to those of the central figures, also take hold of the horns at their extremities. Four tight helices, a rectangular frame articulated like the horns, and a banded cylinder handle-socket with attached rings complete the bronze. The mingling of elements is no substitute for the force of opposition of the earlier talisman; and the simplification of contour limits what vitality the sub- ject still retains. The void pattern is uninteresting in shapes which are fairly evenly distributed. The mod- eling is quite flat. In brief, the piece is more quiet in every respect than the first example. The attached rings, by which the finial could be tied to the mounting pin that does not go across the plaque, may be an indica- tion of a later invention, these being present on other finds of this family. The repoussé third bronze example quiver with plaque, which twenty-one we shall deal, inches a repoussé bronze quiver plaque, twenty-one inches tall, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is about con- temporary with the second cast bronze (Figure 4). The top portion has fared badly. Here, in the first of seven zones, are two pairs of up-standing, winged, horned animals (goats?) flanking trees, each with three leaves; and a single similar group fills the nar- rower bottom register, the tree, however, in full leaf. Four goats in the second scene from the top are treated realistically, three of them walking, the fourth seated with head turned backward. The corresponding divi- sion from the bottom shows a goat similar to the three just indicated and a roaring feline with jaws resem- bling the beak of a predacious bird. The sun-moon ani- mal combat has not yet begun. The three middle registers are of more importance, introducing new motifs. In the first of this group, the two anthropomorphic figures face forward with feet in profile, precedent for which position may be found at least as far back as the Uruk period (ca. 3200-3000 b.c.) ; see, for example, a Mesopotamian cylinder seal in the collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library, on which the hero is depicted with horns (or curls?) and a beard, subduing wild animals. Instead of being repre- sented nude, the figures on the Luristan plaque wear the long dress that was common a few centuries after the Uruk period among the chariot-riding Mesopota- mians, but was reserved for a special class among the Lurs who rode horseback. The two figures clasp fronds (treated not unlike the horns on the finial, see Figure 3) and an upright griffin. Griffin heads come out from either side of their faces, and fronds hang down from their shoulders like wings, perhaps related to the streams of water that flow from the shoulders of Ea, the Akkadian water-god (late third millennium b.c.). The scene embodies first the idea of change and then of growth. The griffin heads symbolize triumph. The ro- sette pattern may represent the Big Dipper or some other constellation given significance by the people across the river to the west. In style and symbolism, this picture shows the impact of foreign influence. In the centermost scene, the lion-eagles have got the upper hand, elevating an ostrich above the head of a goat-faced man who carries ibexes by their hind legs. The stylized bands encircling parts of the anatomy of these animals reflect the exaggerated musculature of the work of the contemporary Assyrians, and fore- shadow the fully developed taste of the Iranians that reached its climax in the Achaemenid polychromed tile work at Susa and painted reliefs at Persepolis. The 98 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4. Luristan bronze quiver plaque of the eighth to sixth centuries B.c., in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Height 21 inches. Courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. spherical headgear on the small goat-faced individual is repeated on the two outermost characters immediately below, who wear horns and long dresses, and daggers like that represented in Figure i A. The person they flank is their apparent victim; the mask that he dangles seems to announce his pending decapitation; and his atti- tude of acceptance indicates that the act is religious. Religion, there- fore, has degenerated from popular mythology to a specialized sacer- dotal rite. It has become a sort of drama to be witnessed, one which is as absurd in its needless cruelty as the mind of man has ever imagined. Astral symbols emblazon the background field. Influence to the northeast from - the seen Assyrians clearly in and the from art of the the settled Lurs - Iranians was to to the northeast - seen clearly in the art of the Lurs - was to culminate in the decease of Luristan culture, the hill-people being unable to maintain for long their way of life alongside the expand- ing empire of the Achaemenids. Passing into oblivion, it is mainly through the bronzes deposited in graves that the Lurs have become known to the modern world. If their chapter in history remains sketchy, it is the more attractive because it is preserved in the great variety of bronze objects that were made and used by them, objects that indicate, and yet are somewhat of a mystery, that reveal, but hold some things back. The best finds show the characteristics of an art of a vigorous people, and, as such, have a definite place within the framework of modern aesthetics. Attention is called to six published Luristan talismans which may be compared with the specimen here discussed (Figure 2) : Phyllis Ackerman, The Luristan Bronzes (New York, 1940), page 11 ; André Godard, Les Bronzes de Luristan (Paris, 1931), figs. 195, 196; Arthur Upham Pope, A Survey of Persian Art (Oxford, 1938), Volume 4, plate 45 A; Illustrated London News, September 6, 1930, page 391, fig. 23 ; September 13, 1930, color plate opposite page 444.
