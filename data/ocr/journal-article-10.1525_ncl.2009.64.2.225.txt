<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Thomas Hardy and the  Machine: The Mechanical  Deformation of Narrative  Realism in Tess of the  d’Urbervilles Z E N A  M E A D O W S O N G   For most of the twentieth century, crit- ics considered Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles (1891)  a staple of Victorian realism and distinguished it, as one of the  author’s major novels, from the comparatively “defective,” “mi- nor” works of the Wessex sequence. As Peter Widdowson and  others have shown, however, the apparent flaws of the lesser- read narratives—the “‘improbable’ use of chance and coinci- dence, ‘flat’ and ‘stagey’ characterization, melodrama, and an  obtrusively over-elaborate style”—appear throughout Hardy’s  fiction, and with problematic frequency in Tess.1 Consider, for  Nineteenth-Century Literature, Vol. 64, No. 2, pp. 225–248.

Dale Kramer (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1999), p. 75.  In his work on the vagaries of Hardy’s reception, Widdowson exposes a conventional  distinction—prevailing for most of the twentieth century—between Hardy’s “major”  works of “humanist realism” and the “minor” works that (“writing large” the faults of  the more favored novels) do not fit the realist mold. Such a view entails, as Widdowson  points out, “tacit ‘theoretical’ premises” that tend “to see [Hardy] as really a practitio- ner of humanist realism . . . whose work is marred on occasion by a perverse deviation  225 NCL6402_04.indd   225 9/15/09   11:21:02 AM </page> <page sequence="2"> 226  nineteenth-century literature instance, the event that initiates the tragic course of the novel:  when Tess has to drive to market for her father, who is too drunk  to go himself, the family’s only horse is skewered to death by  the shaft of the passing mail cart. The disaster is sudden, gro- tesque, and couched in inflated language: “The pointed shaft  of the cart had entered the breast of the unhappy Prince like  a sword; and from the wound his life’s blood was spouting in a  stream, and falling with a hiss into the road.”2 The elaborate- ness of the description seems to travesty the event, calling into  question the plausibility and gravity of the situation. The quasi- chivalric rhetoric (of the Prince and the sword) seems to poke  fun at the calamity, giving the death of the poor workhorse a  kind of courtly significance at odds with the humble nature of  the scene. Yet the incident has the gravest consequences for  the heroine. Having lost the horse (and, with him, much of  her family’s livelihood), Tess has to “claim kin” with a family of  d’Urbervilles who have lately moved in nearby, and this expe- dition exposes her to the villain of the piece. Once again, the  situation seems to draw attention to its own preposterousness.  Alec d’Urberville is a sort of stage villain possessed of evil inten- tions, curled mustaches, and a “bold rolling eye” (Tess, p. 53).  Yet the consequences, again, are serious: Tess is seduced by her  supposed cousin, and her whole catastrophe—her sexual fall,  from the characteristic features of such a mode” (“Hardy and Critical Theory,” p. 76).  Despite periodic exceptions, this view persisted well into the 1980s and 1990s, when  Hardy began to benefit from theoretical approaches (especially materialist, feminist,  and poststructuralist) that tend to question their own premises and seek “to subvert the  orthodox ‘Hardy’ and to remobilize [what Hardy himself called] the ‘disproportioning’  dimension of his work” (“Hardy and Critical Theory,” p. 80). Appropriately, Widdow- son’s own work on Tess emphasizes precisely this aspect of Hardy’s fiction—“its plural  discourses and competing styles, its irony, mannerism and self-deconstructing artificial- ity” (Peter Widdowson, “‘Moments of Vision’: Postmodernizing Tess of the d’Urbervilles:  or, Tess of the d’Urbervilles Faithfully Presented by Peter Widdowson,” in his On Thomas  Hardy: Late Essays and Earlier [New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1998], p. 120). Focusing on  the self-disrupting aspects of Tess, Widdowson demonstrates that this intensely visual  novel persistently draws attention to the inherent limitations of vision, and dramatizes—  while claiming to be the portrait of “A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented”—the inad- equacies of perspective and representation (including its own). 2  Thomas Hardy, Tess of the d’Urbervilles, ed.

Recent work has sought to consider Tess as a novel that,  in its stylistic unevenness, melodramatic characterization, and  improbable plot-development, draws attention to its departure  from the tradition of narrative realism to which it ostensibly  adheres. As realism has itself come into question as a poten- tially problematic form—a form pretending to a transparency  at odds with its quality as fiction, and inclined to furnish imagi- nary resolutions for the contradictions inherent in actual so- cial experience—Hardy’s “lapses” have tended to receive more  sustained and complex treatment. Penny Boumelha, for exam- ple, suggests that Hardy’s novels are radical in their ruptures  of formal coherence, their narrative dissonances demonstrat- ing “resistance to reduction to a single and uniform ideologi- cal position.”3 Tess, she argues, shows “Hardy’s increasing in- terrogation of his own modes of narration” (Thomas Hardy  and Women, p. 132), as Tess’s treatment within the novel—her  objectification by both Alec d’Urberville and Angel Clare—  exposes an exploitative gender ideology in which the narrative,  both deploring and participating in Tess’s victimization, is itself  implicated. John Paul Riquelme, in a similar vein, argues that  Hardy’s novel, destabilizing “determinate representations, con- ventional attitudes, and stable views,” calls its own realism into  question in order to interrogate the validity of its tragic plot.4  Pointing to specific aesthetic decisions, such as the act of nam- ing a character “Angel” and fitting him with a harp (“Echoic  Language,” p. 508), Riquelme argues that the “antirealistic”  aspects of Hardy’s novel cast doubt on the authority of the  social and narrative discourses that ultimately condemn Tess  to death. And Linda M. Shires argues that the “fractures” of  3  Boumelha, Thomas Hardy and Women: Sexual Ideology and Narrative Form (Totowa,  N.J.: Barnes and Noble Books, 1982), p. 7. 4  John Paul Riquelme, “Echoic Language, Uncertainty, and Freedom in Tess of the  d’Urbervilles,” in Thomas Hardy, Tess of the d’Urbervilles: Complete, Authoritative Text with  Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Criti- cal Perspectives, ed.

In Tess, Hardy “challenges the founda- tions of realist character-drawing” (“Radical Aesthetic,” p. 156)  in order to call attention to the social violation of individual  subjectivity. Tess is continually objectified by the men who pur- sue her, and Hardy’s two-dimensional characterization drama- tizes, by reproducing, the violation of which Tess is a victim—the  reduction of individual subjects to objects of exploitation. Ar- guing that there is a kind of social realism at work in Hardy’s  warped characterization, Shires suggests that Tess’s fate is in- tended to liberate her from the social forces that determine  her against her will: “Hardy kills Tess in order to free her from  constructions put on her by society and by individuals” (“Radi- cal Aesthetic,” p. 158). Tess certainly seems to be a sacrificial object—a status un- derscored, at the end of the novel, by her apprehension on the  altar at Stonehenge. Yet it is necessary to question the clem- ency of an author who kills his heroine, even if he does so in  order to expose the brutality of her objectification, or to “free  her” from the invidious constructions of society. Shires notes:  “as the book proceeds, [Tess] becomes less and less individu- alized: turned into a ‘figure in the landscape,’ she eventually  disappears altogether, marked only as having once existed  by the raising of a black flag” (“Radical Aesthetic,” p. 154).  Though logically consistent with her increasing objectifica- tion, this disintegration fashions, at best, an equivocal release  5  See Shires, “The Radical Aesthetic of Tess of the d’Urbervilles,” in The Cambridge Com- panion to Thomas Hardy, ed.

Critics have always been troubled by a contradiction be- tween the relentlessness with which Hardy contrives Tess’s fate  and his apparent sympathy for his heroine. Subjected to one  disaster after another, Tess is constantly victimized by forces be- yond her control, while the narrative continually stresses her  blamelessness. In addition to adding the much-disputed sub- title (“A Pure Woman”) to the novel, Hardy steadily revised the  work in order to emphasize Tess’s innocence,6 and though it  has been argued that his characters create the conditions of  their own downfall—that “it is not true that actions in Hardy  are shaped by some iron determinism”7—this explanation  seems inadequate to account for some of the more outrageous  accidents that befall Tess. Though it is possible to argue that  Tess’s ruin is self-inflicted—holding herself responsible for the  death of the horse, Tess feels compelled to “claim kin” with Alec  d’Urberville—she acts out of a sense of responsibility to her  family, and suffers as a result of a family lineage that has little  to do with individual agency. The pretensions to d’Urberville  grandeur are primarily her father’s, just as the initial calamity  with the horse results from her father’s incapacity. What is re- ally at stake in Tess’s heritage seems to be the narrative mecha- nism by which she is introduced to the conditions of her fall.  As Shires argues, there is “no particular [personal] quality . . .  that undoes her, unless it is, ironically, her sheer excellence as  a human being” (“Radical Aesthetic,” p. 151). Thus, almost as  relentless in exonerating its heroine as it is in victimizing her,  the novel does seem to imply the operation of some “iron de- terminism” in Tess’s case. As the calamities pile on, it is difficult  to shake the impression that there are superhuman forces at  6  See J. T. Laird, The Shaping of “Tess of the d’Urbervilles” (Oxford: Clarendon Press,  1975). In his account of the manuscript and published versions of Tess, Laird describes  the process of the heroine’s development as one of consistent “refining, ennobling,  and idealizing on the part of the author” (Shaping of “Tess of the d’Urbervilles,” p. 125),  and this view tends to underscore the perversity of a narrative that condemns its own  innocent. 7  Terry Eagleton, The English Novel (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2005), p. 200.

It may be that these forces are in a sense too obvious for  contemporary recognition—too long recognized as common- place menaces in Hardy’s fiction. Hardy, as is well known, was  deeply critical of industrial modernity, and Tess has long been  read as a novel concerned with the havoc wreaked by mechani- zation upon the landscape and traditional social forms of agrar- ian Wessex.8 Shires makes a nod in this direction when she links  Tess’s objectification to the “new historical situation which was  altering the relations of society” in the nineteenth century, ob- serving that “mechanization, especially, was changing the re- lationship of the laborer to her work, and was producing an  effect of alienation” (“Radical Aesthetic,” p. 160). Shires does  not, however, pursue the connection between Tess’s personal  objectification and the burgeoning force of mechanization— perhaps, again, because the connection is too obvious. Numer- ous critics have aligned Tess’s sexual objectification with her  physical exploitation as a farm laborer. Boumelha remarks that  Tess, as an agricultural worker, is “at the point of conjuncture of  economic and sexual exploitation” (Thomas Hardy and Women,  p. 39); Elaine Scarry reflects that Tess’s seduction by her em- ployer amounts to “a hazard of the workplace, an industrial  accident”;9 and John Goode, invoking one of the most famous  scenes in the novel, notes that “the violation of the threshing  machine” that Tess endures at Flintcomb-Ash “is clearly coher- ent with the occupation of her body.”10 Indeed, the scene at  Flintcomb-Ash aligns the tyranny of Wessex’s new, steam-driven  machines with the sexual machinations of Tess’s personal ty- rant. Alec, pitchfork in hand, turns up at the same time as the  machine, underscoring the identity between his physical exploi- tation of Tess and the machine’s relentless physical demands.  8  The very name “Wessex” is, of course, an archaism. Hardy appropriated the name  of an ancient Saxon kingdom roughly coextensive with his semifictionalized geogra- phy, thereby emphasizing the rural, preindustrial quality of his landscapes and their  traditional (unmodernized) way of life. 9  Scarry, Resisting Representation (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1994), p. 56. 10  Goode, Thomas Hardy: The Offensive Truth (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988),  p. 131.

At Flintcomb-Ash the primary threat to Tess is indus- trial, and Alec’s power is dwarfed in comparison to the inhu- man force of the machinery that Tess is compelled to serve.  Thus, while Shires and others focus on Tess’s sexual exploita- tion, passing over the relationship between her personal plight  and the “new historical situation” she embodies, I want to argue  that the principal culprit is precisely the historical situation. Re- versing the prevailing critical priorities, and tracing objectifica- tion and the deformations it produces not to individuals but to  the historical processes that overwhelm them, I wish to argue  that the “defects” of the novel are in a literal sense the work of  mechanization. The machine enters Tess of the d’Urbervilles not  only as the diabolical agent of modernization but—driving the  action of the novel and producing its effects—as the primary  determinant of novelistic form. Machines, always a disruptive and destruc- tive force in rural Wessex, are of obvious importance in Hardy’s  novels, and some of the most influential early evaluations of Tess  suggest an ameliorative link between the formal “defects” of the  novel and the problem of mechanization.11 Arnold Kettle and  11  In Tess the steam thresher appears suddenly, an alien threat in the midst of the  preindustrial landscape. In The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886) a “new-fashioned” seed- ing machine materializes in the town square, to the astonishment of the natives (see  Thomas Hardy, The Mayor of Casterbridge: An Authoritative Text, Backgrounds and Contexts,  Criticism, ed. Phillip Mallett, 2d ed. [New York: W. W. Norton and Co., 2001], p. 127).  And Hardy himself, in his recollections of Dorchester (fictionalized as Casterbridge),  recalls the coming of the railroad as a force that, importing popular music from Lon- don, “sl[ew] at a stroke” the old country ballads of oral transmission (see Thomas  Hardy, The Life and Work of Thomas Hardy, ed. Michael Millgate [Athens: Univ. of Geor- gia Press, 1985], p. 25). So disruptive are machines in Hardy’s narratives that Simon  Gatrell has argued that the railway is not only “an instrument of the destruction of Old  Wessex” (see Gatrell, “Wessex,” in The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Hardy, p. 28), but  in fact the destroyer of the narrative impulse itself. The gradual incursion of machines  in The Mayor of Casterbridge and Tess is completed, Gatrell argues, in Hardy’s last novel,  Jude the Obscure (1895), where an industrialized New Wessex replaces the preindustrial  world that Tess inhabits: “Hardy lost much when he achieved what [has been] called  New Wessex. His losses included the desire to write more novels” (“Wessex,” p. 32). In  NCL6402_04.indd   231 9/15/09   11:21:03 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> 232  nineteenth-century literature Irving Howe, among the first important “materialist” critics of  Tess, praise it as a work of industrial realism,12 and though both  repeat the typical objections to Hardy’s technique—lamenting  his unconvincing characterization and his tendency to “[flout]  normal probability” (Kettle, “Thomas Hardy,” p. 53)—both ex- onerate him on the score of industrial themes. For Kettle, Tess is  essentially an allegory for the fate of agrarian England, and the  novel’s “faultiness” subsides when it is read as a tragedy of indus- trialization. In his view, Tess Durbeyfield stands for an ancient,  preindustrial order destroyed by the machine, and her tragedy—  however unconvincing or overdrawn as a story of personal ex- perience—gains significance and plausibility through the force  of its symbolic implications. Howe is harder to please, disputing  the position that Tess is merely “the agricultural predicament in  metaphor”;13 yet he too emphasizes the heroine’s relationship to  “the shock of the new farm machines” in rural Wessex (Howe,  Thomas Hardy, p. 124). Moreover, though he complains that the  novel’s “piling on of woes . . . must strain the resources of ordi- nary credence” (Thomas Hardy, p. 112), the plausibility problem  disappears for Howe at Flintcomb-Ash. Here the machine—the  steam thresher—nearly destroys Tess, as it will inevitably destroy  the way of life she stands for: “Tess as a woman, Tess as a distinc- tive person hardly exists [on the machine]; she has become a  factor in the process of production” (Thomas Hardy, p. 125). For  Howe, as for Kettle, this violation of Tess is only too probable. At  Flintcomb-Ash, she embodies the industrial fate of an agrarian  people, confronting what Kettle identifies as “real problems of  quite overwhelming difficulty” (“Thomas Hardy,” p. 58). According to Howe, “Even those critics and readers who  question Hardy’s place as a novelist are likely to acknowledge  Gatrell’s view, the outcry over Jude the Obscure’s ostensible indecency merely “made the  decision [to stop writing novels] easier” (“Wessex,” p. 32). Preindustrial Wessex had  finally succumbed to the inevitable pressure of industrialization, and Hardy’s subject— the old world of agrarian England—had succumbed with it. 12  See Arnold Kettle, “Thomas Hardy: Tess of the D’Urbervilles (1891),” in his An Intro- duction to the English Novel, Volume II: Henry James to the Present Day (New York: Hutchin- son’s Univ.

Yet Tess is not perfectly regular in its render- ing of the industrial situation. However realistic the scene is in  effect—however convincing its “piling on of woes,” and aesthet- ically controlled its execution—the novel undergoes a subtle  deformation in its representation of the machine. Through a  deft distortion of the “real,” Hardy turns Flintcomb-Ash into  a living hell, and he turns the machine—through a strangely  logical mutation of documentary language—into a monster: Close under the eaves of the stack, and as yet barely visible was the  red tyrant that the women had come to serve—a timber-framed  construction, with straps and wheels appertaining—the threshing-  machine, which, whilst it was going, kept up a despotic demand  upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves. A little way off there was another indistinct figure; this one  black, with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in  reserve. The long chimney running up beside an ash-tree, and  the warmth which radiated from the spot, explained . . . that  here was the engine which was to act as the primum mobile of this  little world. (Tess, pp. 444–45) Here the simple “timber-framed construction” of the thresher  acquires human characteristics (it is experienced as a “tyrant”  or “despot” by the people who tend it) and gradually develops—  through a logical extension of this anthropomorphism—the  dimensions of a demon and a god. Its engine is “the primum  mobile,” or “prime mover,” of the “little world” of the farm; its  colors (red and black), like its serpent’s hiss, are diabolical; and  it changes Wessex into an underworld, a place of “ash-tree[s]”  and smoke. Ash trees are of course real trees, yet here they  acquire a symbolic value attuned to the mythic machine, and  that transformation (from the “real” to the symbolic or mythic)  marks a formal shift away from the more strictly documentary  language of “straps and wheels appertaining.” The satanic ren- dering of the machine is still realistic—consistent with the in- dustrial menace of the scene and the tortures to which Tess is  about to be exposed. Yet, in order to convey the extremity of  NCL6402_04.indd   233 9/15/09   11:21:03 AM </page> <page sequence="10"> 234  nineteenth-century literature her circumstances, the realist novel undergoes a mythic defor- mation, literally creating a monster in the machine. The steam thresher is a monster of diabolical propor- tions, a “red tyrant” endowed with a power superior to its hu- man creators. Keeping up “a despotic demand upon the en- durance of [the laborers’] muscles and nerves,” the machine  created to serve the human community—to ease the labor of  the harvest—actually enslaves it, and the rural people regret  the passing of the old days “when everything, even to the win- nowing, was effected by hand-labour” (Tess, p. 446). Paradoxi- cally, the machine is most realistic in this very monstrosity; it  exposes, in its superhuman power, the terrible irony of the  industrial conditions it creates. Far more brutal and exhaust- ing than the laborious methods it was built to replace, the ma- chine is inhuman in its strength and dehumanizing to those  who tend it. Thus, the engine-man is a kind of demon, like  his machine: “his thoughts [are] turned inwards upon him- self, his eye on his iron charge; . . . as if some ancient doom  compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of  his Plutonic master” (p. 445).14 God-like, the machine makes  its servants over in its own image, and the process of conver- sion is brutally dramatized in its treatment of Tess: given the  worst job at Flintcomb-Ash, Tess has to stand atop the ma- chine and pass sheaves to the engine-man. Though the other  workers can pause to refresh themselves, “for Tess there was  no respite; for, as the drum [of the thresher] never stopped,  the man who fed it could not stop, and she, who had to supply  14  The engine-man, sharing the diabolical properties of the machine, is another  monster—“a dark motionless being, a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness, in a  sort of trance” (Tess, p. 445). Hardy in fact revised this passage to de-emphasize the hu- man quality of the engine-man. Changing “man” to “being” and replacing “figure” with  “embodiment of tallness,” he suppressed the human in the engine-man and stressed  the demonic. For a transcription of this portion of the manuscript, see Laird, Shaping  of “Tess of the d’Urbervilles,” p. 81; and Thomas Hardy, Tess of the d’Urbervilles: A Facsimile  of the Manuscript, with Related Materials, ed. Simon Gatrell, vol. 2 (New York: Garland  Publishing, 1986), pp. 78–79. In this description, of course, the engine-man resembles  all alienated labor, his dehumanization itself the sign of that alienation: individuals,  forced to sell their labor, enter the economy as commodities—as things, not people— and are reduced to mere interchangeable parts in a system of production. Hired to  tend the machine, the engine-man’s subjectivity is reduced to a functional level, and he  himself becomes like, and subservient to, the machine he is deployed to control.

Enslaved to the machine, whose hum “increased to  a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the regular  quantity” (p. 447), Tess loses all individual volition, her body  conforming to its demands—even after it is turned off. When  the “whirling” of the thresher finally ceases, Tess’s “knees  trembl[e] so wretchedly with the shaking of the machine that  she [can] scarcely walk” away from it (p. 448).15 In comparison to the stagey villain and the more gro- tesque calamities that befall Tess in the novel, the mechanical  monster at Flintcomb-Ash seems hardly unrealistic. Indeed, the  mythic representation of the machine captures, with unique  power and figurative authenticity, the ironic horror of mech- anization—the recognition that humanity, seeking liberation  in labor-saving devices, becomes enslaved to its own machines.  Yet the most deplored of the novel’s supposed formal defects— its implausible plotting and inflexible villain—appear to result,  like the monster, from a connection to the machine. Though  Tess’s experience at the “starve-acre farm” (Tess, p. 413) is in  a sense the most plausible development in her decline (since  she is driven by circumstances to take whatever work is of- fered), the scene establishes a relationship between hardship  and mechanization—and, in the demonic machine, between  realism and the deformation of realism—that suggests a literal di- mension in the “plot devices” working against her. Hardy’s plot- ting is often described as “mechanical,” and readers frequently  complain that Tess’s fate seems “engineered.” I would suggest  15  In an essay called “The Dorsetshire Labourer” (1883), which has long been rec- ognized as a source for Tess, Hardy emphasizes the degree to which the machine appro- priates the worker’s body to its own relentless operations: “I am not sure whether, at the  present time, women are employed to feed the machine, but some years ago a woman  had frequently to stand just above the whizzing wire drum, and feed from morning  to night. . . . [One woman], who had been feeding the machine all day, declared on  one occasion that in crossing a field on her way home in the fog after dusk, she was  so dizzy from the work as to be unable to find the opposite gate, and there she walked  round and round the field, bewildered and terrified, till three o’clock in the morning,  before she could get out. The farmer said that the ale had got into her head, but she  maintained that it was the spinning of the machine” (Thomas Hardy, “The Dorsetshire  Labourer,” in Thomas Hardy’s Public Voice: The Essays, Speeches, and Miscellaneous Prose, ed.  Michael Millgate [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2001], p. 55). NCL6402_04.indd   235 9/15/09   11:21:04 AM </page> <page sequence="12"> 236  nineteenth-century literature that these metaphors are in a sense intuitions of a literal fact.  If Hardy insists upon a fate Tess does not deserve, and deploys  forces against her that seem contrived and mechanical, then  this is literally the case: the novel’s plot is mechanical, and even  draws attention to its contrivances, because Tess is pursued by  the machine.16 At Flintcomb-Ash, Tess—a dairymaid and fieldworker—  personifies a traditional, agrarian way of life essentially anteced- ent to the machine, and her exposure to the demonic thresher  aligns her destiny with that of rural Wessex, which will inevitably  succumb to mechanization. Although the nominal villain, here  and elsewhere, is Alec d’Urberville, his tyranny is closely aligned  with the machine’s. Like Alec, the threshing machine is new to  rural Wessex, and comes originally from the industrial North  (the engine-man speaks “in a strange northern accent” [Tess,  p. 445]); like Alec, the thresher is “in the agricultural world,  but not of it” (p. 445); and the mythic representation of the  tyrannical machine—its diabolical appearance and its serpent’s  hiss—matches the satanic posture of Tess’s pitchfork-wielding  personal tyrant. Indeed, as John Goode and others have noted,  the threshing machine’s objectification of Tess bears a family  resemblance to Alec’s behavior. Just as Alec treats Tess as an  object—a physical thing to be used as he wishes—the machine  reduces her to a functional nonentity (she becomes, as Howe  puts it, a mere “factor in the process of production”). More  perfectly indifferent to the suffering it imposes, the machine  may even out-villain Alec in this respect. Yet the resemblance  between them is reinforced by the “kinship” plot that exposes  16  The care with which Hardy planned the novel is obvious from the force with  which he realizes Tess’s tragedy; yet the disasters that befall Tess seem unrealistic— unlikely and unprovoked. Indeed, as Penny Boumelha has pointed out, Tess is actu- ally unconscious at critical moments. She is asleep at the reins when the mail cart kills  her horse, asleep in the Chase when Alec seduces her, and asleep on an altar when  the police close in on her at Stonehenge. Yet, as the fanatical stile-painter writes on a  country fence—in the harsh red pigment associated elsewhere with machinery—her  “DAMNATION, SLUMBERETH, NOT” (Tess, p. 113). She is driven involuntarily, even  unconsciously, to her destiny, while circumstances work emphatically against her, and  her single attempt to liberate herself (when she murders Alec) only ensures her execu- tion. Hardy gives her no way out, sacrificing her to forces beyond her comprehension  or control.

Thus, when he meets Tess (an authentic  d’Urberville, though of decayed family), the tyranny to which he  subjects her takes on the valences of the new—and artificial— destroying the old. Just as Tess bears a symbolic relationship  to old Wessex, embodying a traditional way of life threatened  by the machine, Alec comes to personify the new, mechanical  forces that threaten to destroy her.17 Alec’s appearance at Flintcomb-Ash underscores his relation- ship to the machine, and though Tess chooses the machine over  Alec—she stays atop the thresher in order to avoid him—this is  really a non-choice, and a mere delay of the inevitable. Reprieves  are only apparent; the machinery of Tess’s fate is, everywhere,  inexorably in motion. Even at Talbothays dairy—a sort of prein- dustrial Eden to which Tess, escaping Alec’s influence, goes after  the death of her illegitimate child—the fatal progress of her des- tiny is only seemingly suspended. As Irving Howe remarks, “there  can be no doubt that in coming to Talbothays Tess has taken an- other step in her social descent: she is a hired hand and the work  itself is seasonal” (Thomas Hardy, p. 122). The idyllic life at the  dairy is only temporary, and the lyrical passages in which it is de- scribed—the gorgeous sequences in which Tess’s work appears to  proceed in harmony with the natural world, and her sexual sub- jection promises to be ameliorated in the burgeoning affections  of Angel Clare—represent a condition that cannot be sustained.  Talbothays appears to restore Tess to a prelapsarian state—a pre- industrial, unalienated condition where neither labor nor love  17  This symbolic relationship—the new d’Urberville tyrannizing over the old  one—is not accidental. Hardy’s original surname for Alec was “Hawnferne” (a name  that severs the possibilities of the “kinship” plot), and the gradual adjustment of the  naming principle, by which Tess and Alec were brought into ostensibly lineal corre- spondence, increased Alec’s symbolic function. As Laird puts it, “Alec represents the  forces of moneyed wealth and industrial progress which threaten the traditional agri- cultural way of life still being pursued—however precariously—by Tess and her par- ents” (Shaping of “Tess of the d’Urbervilles,” p. 138). Indeed, one of Hardy’s last revisions  to Alec’s surname—“Smith” to “Stoke”—suggests, through the industrial associations  of the word “stoke” (engines, furnaces, and boilers), the manufacturing source of the  nouveau-d’Urberville money.

Yet even here,  Tess responds to Angel with an “unreflecting inevitableness” (p.  213) that recalls the circumstances of her earlier seduction, and  Angel, apologizing for his advances, hopes that he has not (as  Alec has before him) “presumed upon [her] defencelessness” (p.  215). The lyrical beauty of the Talbothays passages, literalized in  the figure of Angel at his harp, seems to promise a reprieve for  Tess that is at best fleeting, at worst illusory. Indeed, Angel plays  the harp with “no great skill” (p. 176), and his lyricism seems in- tended to draw attention to the fundamental inadequacy of the  Talbothays idyll: neither the dairy nor Angel can ultimately re- store Tess to a prelapsarian condition; neither can permanently  impede the machinery of her fate. It is significant that when Angel attracts Tess with his harp- playing in the rough gardens of Dairyman Crick, it is already a  post-lapsarian landscape she walks through, “gathering cuckoo- spittle on her skirts, cracking snails . . . underfoot, staining her  hands with thistle-milk and slug-slime, and rubbing off upon  her naked arms sticky blights which, though snow-white on the  appletree-trunks, made madder stains on her skin” (Tess, p.  175). Here Tess’s stained skirts, hands, and naked arms recall,  like the apple blight, the fruit that she has already tasted with  Alec, and her doom—inscribed in the “madder stains”—bears  down upon her even as she appears to be released from it. As  she drives the milk to the station with Angel, the scenes of her  new love recall her old seduction. Angel is not the anti-Alec but  in fact a new version of him (as Boumelha has pointed out, driv- ing Tess in a carriage and feeding her with fruit, Angel repeats  elements of Alec’s seduction),18 and the journey to the station  18  Boumelha argues: “[Alec and Angel] are not the opposites that they might at  first appear; they are precisely complementary, as is emphasised, not only by Alec’s  temporary conversion to evangelicism and Angel’s momentary transformation into a  rake with Izz [when he invites her, on the spur of the moment, to elope with him to  Brazil], but also by the similarities between their ways of gaining Tess’s acquiescence. It  is not only Alec who is associated with the gigs and traps that, on occasion, literally run  NCL6402_04.indd   238 9/15/09   11:21:04 AM </page> <page sequence="15"> tess of the d’urbervilles 239 brings Tess face-to-face with the force that will demolish her  way of life: “Modern life stretched out its steam feeler to this  point three or four times a day, touched the native existences,  and quickly withdrew its feeler again” (Tess, p. 268). Though  still a tentative incursion, the railway represents the machinery  that will inevitably overwhelm Tess and all of old Wessex. In- deed, the “hissing of [the] train” (p. 268) emphasizes a sense  of inevitable fatality: the mechanical snake in the garden, the  locomotive’s hiss both recalls the origin of Tess’s calamity—the  sound of Prince’s blood falling “with a hiss into the road”— and anticipates the “sustained hiss” of the monster thresher at  Flintcomb-Ash. At the depot, Tess meditates on the alienation  inherent in agricultural production—the fact that the milk that  she and Angel deliver will be drunk in London by people “who  have never seen a cow” (p. 269). The dairy is not a reprieve  from but an inevitable phase in her decline; the machinery of  her fate, reaching out a “steam feeler” at Talbothays, propels  her toward the hissing engines of Flintcomb-Ash and the em- brace of her former seducer. Flintcomb-Ash represents the nadir of Tess’s misfortunes.  The narrative underscores her devastation as she is abandoned  by Angel, subjected to the tyrannical machine, and belea- guered by a villain that she had seemed, at Talbothays, to have  escaped. Her Angel flown to Brazil, Tess is caught between Alec  and the demonic machine, doomed to succumb to the inexora- ble, overwhelming force that they both represent. Though Alec  does not prevail at the starve-acre farm, Tess’s only alternative  is to stay with the machine—just as release from the machine  precipitates her, again, toward Alec. Eluded at Flintcomb-Ash,  Alec gets Tess back when her family is turned out of their cot- tage at the expiration of her father’s life-hold. Like the steam  thresher, the end of the life-hold is a symptom of moderniza- tion in Wessex—a stage in the gradual detachment of rural  away with Tess; it is during a journey in a wagon driven by Angel that he finally secures  Tess’s acceptance of his proposal. Equally, the two ride to their wedding in a sinister,  funereal carriage, and when Angel makes his proposition to Izz, she is riding in his gig.  It is noticeable, too, that during their wagon-ride, Angel feeds Tess with berries that  he has pulled from the trees with a whip, recalling the scene at The Slopes when Alec  feeds her with strawberries” (Thomas Hardy and Women, pp. 131–32).

Further, it is explicitly associ- ated with the force of machinery. According to the narrator, as  life-holds fell in, rural families “had to seek refuge in the large  centres; the process, humorously designated by statisticians as  ‘the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns,’  being really the tendency of water to flow uphill when forced  by machinery” (Tess, p. 478). Particularly telling here is the as- sociation of social change with the causal force of “machinery.”  This image of compulsion indicates the quality of that compul- sion: modernized, unfeeling, mechanical. Thus, when Tess goes  back to Alec under these circumstances, the resort aligns him,  once again, with the overwhelming force of the machine.19 In Tess, then, the villain—whether the diabolical thresher  or the satanic squire—either is or is identified with the machine,  and the novel’s major “defects” result from that machinery. Tess  is doomed because the agricultural order that she personifies is  doomed, and Alec’s diabolical tyranny—his incessant objectifi- cation of Tess—is enforced by the fatal plot of industrialization.  The very improbabilities of Tess’s experience dramatize, in  their inexorable operation, the consequences of the mechanical  forces at work against her, and Alec’s villainy derives, in its very  overdetermination, from his identification with those forces. As  the narrator puts it, Tess’s destiny shows the improbable “ten- dency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery,” and  the process to which it exposes her induces not only distortions  of plot and character but also strange warps of tone and style.  Since the narrative has to impose the mechanical conditions  it decries, it tends to obtrude its distortions. Thus, overdeter- mined in his ethereal inadequacy, Angel plays his second-hand  harp with “no great skill,” and Alec appears to send up his own  villainy, mocking, in the flourishes of his pitchfork, the fiendish  malformation of his character. Though Tess’s fate is brutally  19  There is some evidence that Hardy’s use of this word—“machinery”—is uniquely  determined at this point in the novel: in Hardy’s 1883 essay “The Dorsetshire La- bourer,” the passage under discussion here appears almost verbatim. For the novel,  however, Hardy added the words “by machinery.” Compare the passage from Tess  above with the original version: “This process, which is designated by statisticians as  ‘the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns,’ is really the tendency of  water to flow uphill when forced” (Hardy, “The Dorsetshire Labourer,” p. 56).

This self-satirizing tendency is distinguishable in the earli- est catastrophes of the novel, and it appears, in the narrative of  Tess’s misfortunes, earlier than either Angel or Alec. Already in  the incident that sets the machinery of Tess’s fate in motion— the collision with the mail cart—the narrative seems to poke  fun at the calamities it arranges, making light of its own malevo- lence. Suggesting a chivalric joust between Tess’s horse and the  mail cart, it first mocks Tess’s poor “Prince” and then dwells,  with grotesque determination, upon the spectacle of the disas- ter: “The huge pool of blood in front of [Tess] was already as- suming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the sun rose  a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it” (Tess, p. 44).  In the rainbow tints of Prince’s blood, the narrative seems to re- flect upon the appalling beauty of its own plot devices, perhaps  admiring the sheer overdetermination of the calamity and the  spectrum of devastation to be coaxed from this single disaster.  Indeed, in retrospect, the scene tends to emphasize the prede- termination of Tess’s fate. Parodying Prince’s faintly preposter- ous name, the narrative of his death (the chivalric discourse of  the “Prince” and the “sword”) satirizes the Durbeyfields’ fatal  pretensions to grandeur. Further, the phallic and mechanical  circumstances of that death (death-by-shaft and death-by-ma- chine) foreshadow, with rather revolting accuracy, the series of  disasters about to befall the heroine.20 Tess tries, of course, to  20  Appropriately, the accident with the mail cart marks Tess’s first encounter with  a modern machine. The mail cart is a wonder of nineteenth-century technology: “with  its two noiseless wheels, speeding along [the] lanes like an arrow,” it easily demolishes  the “slow and unlighted equipage” (Tess, p. 44) belonging to the Durbeyfields. (I am  indebted to Jonathan H. Grossman, who commented on an earlier version of this es- say, for the observation that the carriage is—though not steam-driven—a machine.)  Indeed, though Tess’s cart is a fairly primitive contraption, even the most diabolical of  Tess’s machines—the threshing machine at Flintcomb-Ash—bears, with its “straps and  wheels appertaining,” a family resemblance to the cart. Thus, the disaster with the mail  cart not only sets Tess on her tragic path, but also suggests an evolutionary link between  the ancient contrivances of Wessex and those of the modern (steel- and steam-driven)  world that will inevitably demolish it. Moreover, the connection between these simple  machines and the oncoming tragedy of mechanization sheds light on the famous leg- end of the d’Urberville coach (which is said to be audible, in its passing, only to “one  NCL6402_04.indd   241 9/15/09   11:21:05 AM </page> <page sequence="18"> 242  nineteenth-century literature resist her fate: “put[ting] her hand upon the hole” in Prince’s  breast, she tries desperately to staunch the bleeding—but “with  the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt  with the crimson drops” (Tess, p. 44). Here, as everywhere else  in the novel, the “only result” of her resistance is compounded  misery. Her efforts are futile, merely staining (in graphic ad- umbration of her defloration and murder of Alec) her skirt,  hands, and face with blood. In Tess of the d’Urbervilles, the heroine is doomed from the  start. It seems that Tess does nothing to deserve her fate, and  this is precisely the case. Any attempt to save herself is undone,  like her attempt to save Prince, by the historical and narra- tive circumstances that control her. In the opening scenes of  the book, Tess is already the victim of a system in which the  narrative, if it is to succeed in its critique of mechanization,  must participate; though a long way from Flintcomb-Ash, the  machinery of her destiny is already in operation as she drives  Prince to Casterbridge market before dawn. Thus, the “hiss”  of the satanic machine is sounded as Prince’s blood falls into  the road, and even the most lyrical passages of the novel antici- pate a terminal calamity. The notes of Angel’s lyre, sounded at  Talbothays, not only denote a false reprieve but also anticipate  the scene at Stonehenge, which sings like “some gigantic one- stringed harp” at the site of Tess’s apprehension (Tess, p. 534).  Everywhere, the machinery of the heroine’s fate is in motion.  Yet this mechanical dimension of the novel—the very dimen- sion that helps explain the narrative’s apparent defects of char- acter, plotting, and tonal consistency—also produces its defects.  To expose the overwhelming problem of mechanization, Tess  must succumb to the machine. Yet for Tess to succumb to the  machine, the narrative has to act like a machine. It has to pro- pel her toward her death, participating in the destruction of its  own heroine. To indict the mechanical order, the novel has to  become complicit in the very process it seeks to expose. of d’Urberville blood,” and is “of ill-omen to the one who hears it” [p. 480]). Through  the coach, the legend reconnects Tess’s fate (she is doomed, according to the legend,  to suffer the transgressions of her ancestors) to the operation of machinery.

On the one hand, Tess is a realistic work, reflecting, as  Kettle notes, “real problems of quite overwhelming difficulty”;  on the other hand, because the success of its anti-industrial cri- tique depends upon its participation in the very system it de- plores, it is a problematic work, and draws attention to itself  as such. Only recently have critics begun to recognize that its  lapses are significant—that its deformed characterization im- plicates deforming processes; that its improbable plotting is  enforced by inevitable historical changes; that its stylistic and  tonal inconsistencies draw attention to the grotesquerie of a  work that has to collude with the machine in order to fight  it. Tess is, quite literally, a provoking work—one that attracts  criticism in the interest of making its point. But once we recog- nize that this is the case—once we distinguish the relationship  between Tess’s deformities and its self-implicating critique of  mechanization—then the very litany of its faults becomes a re- source. Its most vexing defects expose a series of formal choices  determined by the machine. To return, then, to the critical appraisal, it is worth con- sidering the persistent focus on defective characterization— especially Alec d’Urberville’s—in light of what we might call  Hardy’s narrative “mechanics.” The characterization of Alec is,  and always has been, one of the most deplored elements of the  book; yet recent criticism has begun to explore the possibility  of a determined relationship between the “flawed” represen- tation of Hardy’s stagey villain and the flawed social realities  he represents.21 As we have seen, Linda Shires connects Alec’s  21   In a sense this is an old observation, as both Kettle and Howe suggest a relation- ship between Hardy’s “florid, moustache-twirling bounder” (Kettle, “Thomas Hardy,”  p. 55) and a kind of anti-mimetic realism. Howe justifies Alec’s “stag[iness]” as “a fu- sion of theater and truth” (Thomas Hardy, p. 115), and Kettle remarks that “the whole  point about D’Urberville is that he is indeed the archetypal Victorian villain”—a figure  to be “enthusiastically hissed by [an] audience” (“Thomas Hardy,” p. 55) that recog- nizes him not as a person but a symbolical “type.” Satisfied with the symbolic remedy,  NCL6402_04.indd   243 9/15/09   11:21:05 AM </page> <page sequence="20"> 244  nineteenth-century literature stereotyped villainy to the stereotyping process itself, arguing  that his “flatness” dramatizes the evils of objectification. In  light of the mechanical deformation of Tess, however, I would  push the point a step further, linking Alec’s warped character- ization to the force of mechanization with which he is aligned  in the novel. Though Alec objectifies Tess, it is, after all, Alec  himself who is most thoroughly stereotyped, reduced to a two- dimensional villainy that seems both to enact and to embody  the ravages of the machine. Formally, no other character is  as “flat.” Even Angel seems more rounded, his rigidity appar- ently a function of his evangelism and conventional attitudes,  his inadequacy a seemingly natural outgrowth of his personal  limitations. Moreover, Angel shows some capacity for personal  growth, returning (albeit too late) to Tess, while Alec perse- veres in his villainy, his destructive tenacity matched only by  the machine he represents. Thus, although Alec’s identifica- tion with the machine enhances, arguably, his significance in  the narrative (it gives a sort of symbolic substance to his con- ventional villainy), I would venture that it is also responsible for  the implacable “flatness” of his character. Alec is little more than a stage villain or a plot device de- ployed to ruin the heroine, and there is certainly something  overly simplified—and persistently simplified—about him. Though  Shires argues that “some readers resist a three-dimensional  Alec” (“Radical Aesthetic,” p. 152), this seems to be an irre- sistible consequence of his characterization itself. The expla- nation of his flatness does not actually impart a third dimen- sion to him; rather, it explains the lack of such a dimension.  Though it is arguable that Alec has, somewhere, a rounded  subjectivity (as Shires points out, even he, “the character pre- sented most stereotypically, . . . assumes new identities as the  book proceeds” [“Radical Aesthetic,” p. 154]), the novel seems  to foreclose upon Alec’s burgeoning complexity in the very act  of suggesting it. For instance, some kind of soul-searching must  compel Alec to denounce his sinfulness and become an itiner- ant preacher about two-thirds of the way through the book. Yet  however, neither critic develops the formal implications of the symbolic connection  between the villain’s unrealistic characterization and the social realism of his “type.” NCL6402_04.indd   244 9/15/09   11:21:05 AM </page> <page sequence="21"> tess of the d’urbervilles 245 that very itinerancy propels him into Tess’s vicinity again, where  his accidental meeting with her pushes him back into his accus- tomed role: “I could not resist you as soon as I met you again!”  he says (Tess, p. 442). This is not Tess’s fault, but neither—so  Alec claims—is it his. He is rather compelled to act as he does,  as though his individual relation to Tess were as inevitable as  the demolition of the old world that he symbolizes.22 I would suggest that it is precisely Alec’s identification  with the machine that produces these apparently mechani- cal compulsions, limiting his subjectivity in the very moment  of its potential expansion. Alec has, by dint of his relationship  to the machine, a functional role to play in the novel, and that  functional position limits and distorts what is (presumably)  an irreducible subjectivity. As Alex Woloch has demonstrated,  the more functional the position a character occupies within  narrative structure, the more “flat” the character becomes, the  very flatness expressing the “reduction and dislocation” of a po- tentially whole subjectivity.23 Alec, in his encounters with Tess,  functions—like the machines he symbolizes—in one particular,  repetitive way, and the consequence of that functionality is al- ways the destruction of his individual integrity. Alec, in short, is  a victim of what Woloch calls “specialization and its discontents”  (The One vs. the Many, p. 174): Alec’s two-dimensionality is the  price that his subjectivity is constantly paying for his identifica- tion with the machine. Character in Tess, then, is not only sym- bolically related to the demolition of the old world by the new,  but in fact dramatizes, in its very deformations, the destructive  22  Narrative foreclosure on Alec’s subjectivity is evident elsewhere, and seems pro- grammatic in Tess. For instance, one of the most critical moments in the novel—the  seduction or rape of Tess in the Chase—is not narrated, and intentionally occludes  Alec’s motives. It is unclear whether Alec is actually lost in the Chase (whether he  meant to seduce/violate Tess all along, or whether he merely blundered into the op- portunity). Moreover, Tess’s own level of resistance remains uncertain, and though  the ambiguity of the encounter raises the possibility of complex motives and desires  on both sides, the narrative refuses to satisfy us on this point. The seduction/rape is  omitted altogether, and the story skips forward to the consequences of the incident.  Any equivocations on Alec’s part are left out, as they are in the narration of subsequent  encounters. 23  See Woloch, The One vs. the Many: Minor Characters and the Space of the Protagonist in  the Novel (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 2003), p. 174. NCL6402_04.indd   245 9/15/09   11:21:06 AM </page> <page sequence="22"> 246  nineteenth-century literature consequences of that process. Tess is destroyed by Alec and the  machine with which he is symbolically associated, but Alec is  destroyed by it too. Like Tess atop the steam thresher, unable  to do anything but respond to the machine, Alec’s whole char- acter is collapsed into a functional association. His alignment  with the machine means that he becomes a machine, and the  resulting distortion of his character—the reduction of his hu- manity—implicitly critiques the force he represents. There is some evidence that Hardy was not at all perturbed  by the machine-made deformations of Tess. It is perhaps a mark  of narrative sympathy that the novel itself undergoes the depre- dations to which it subjects its heroine; and though Tess suffers,  deformed in plot and character, from its association with the  machine, Hardy seems to have felt that such narrative distor- tions were the very stuff of art. In a frequently quoted passage  from the Life and Work, composed while he was preparing the  serial version of Tess in 1890, Hardy wrote: Art is a disproportioning—(i.e., distorting, throwing out of pro- portion)—of realities, to show more clearly the features that mat- ter in those realities, which, if merely copied or reported inven- torially, might possibly be observed, but would more probably be  overlooked. Hence “realism” is not Art. (Life and Work, p. 239) Hardy’s comments on realism in the Life and Work suggest what  we might call an aesthetic of distortion in the mechanical de- fects of Tess. If “realism is not Art,” it would seem that the lapses  of realism in Tess—the distorted characters and improbable plot  devices—constitute the “Art” of the novel and the substance of  Hardy’s vision. The result is, of course, problematic—but so are  the circumstances that the novel represents. Tess’s indictment  of a particular modern reality depends upon narrative deforma- tions that jeopardize its success as a realistic novel; yet the osten- sible defects—the distortions of narrative realism—constitute  an authentic representation of the reality portrayed. The novel  subjects itself to the machine in order to expose the machine,  and its success as a representation depends upon its implication  in the mechanical tyranny it discloses. Tess of the d’Urbervilles is  not a mere “copy” or “inventory” of life under the influence of  modernization; it is rather an image of life distorted—thrown  NCL6402_04.indd   246 9/15/09   11:21:06 AM </page> <page sequence="23"> tess of the d’urbervilles 247 out of proportion—by machinery. In the very imperfections of  its realism, Tess discloses the deformations that really “matter”  in the reality represented—deformations that, according to the  Life and Work, would probably be overlooked in a more per- fectly realistic work. Through a twist of critical fate that the wry Thomas Hardy  would undoubtedly have enjoyed, the significance of narrative  deformation in Tess of the d’Urbervilles was overlooked for about  a century. The critical tradition, in its concern to moderate  Hardy’s faults as a realist writer—to give substance to his two- dimensional villain and to justify the clunking determinism of  his plot—necessarily neglected the innovative, even revolution- ary side of Tess’s strange distortions. Current work, however,  increasingly seeks to remedy the defects of a critical practice  that attempts to elide or ameliorate Hardy’s ostensible faults,  and such a correction makes it possible to understand Hardy’s  formal radicalism and to appreciate it in new ways—to distin- guish the paradoxical but determined relationship between his  “defective” realism and his formal commitment to real histori- cal problems. Though Tess is apparently improved, as a realist  novel, by its symbolic indictment of mechanization, the sym- bolic dimension does not alter the narrative deformities en- forced by the machine. Rather, it depends upon them. Hardy  could certainly have written a novel composed of convincing  characters and plausible situations; instead, he chose to expose  his novel to the machine, actually putting it through the indus- trial deformations that he wished to represent. The result is a  “defective” work of realism, yet the very defects of the novel  draw attention, in their inexorable, mechanical operation, to  the defects of modern life and the deforming processes of ma- chine culture.

The narra- tive “defects” of which critics typically complain—“mechanical” plot devices, “two-di- mensional” characterization, and obtrusions of tone and style—are, this essay argues,  intentional distortions of realism designed to draw attention to the consequences of  industrialization. In a crucial scene, Tess Durbeyfield is enslaved to a monster machine,  a diabolical steam thresher. Dramatizing the onset of mechanization, this scene aligns  the fate of the novel’s heroine with the fate of the preindustrial world she inhabits  and, introducing a subtle distortion of realism in the mythic rendering of the monster,  connects the narrative’s apparent defects to a critique of the industrial order. The “me- chanical” plot of the novel, linked to the operation of actual machines, draws attention  to the inexorable brutality of the historical forces that drive it; the “two-dimensional”  villain, a double for the diabolical machine, dramatizes–in the functional reduction of  his humanity–the personal consequences of mechanization; and the narrative’s tonal  inconsistencies, apparently satirizing the calamities it itself engineers, demonstrate its  implication in a mechanical system it cannot both escape and expose. Enacting the rav- ages of industrialization, the novel in a sense becomes the mechanical monster it repre- sents; yet in doing so, it renders a powerful, formal indictment of mechanization.
