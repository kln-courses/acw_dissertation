Atkinson Michigan State Univ. Copyright 1 995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Lower extremity (knee) trauma is currently based on a bone fracture criterion derived from impacts of aged specimens. Recent clinical studies, however, indicate that a chronic disease (post-traumatic osteoarthritis), may be precipitated after mechanical insult without obvious bone fracture(l). It is hypothesized this is due to microcracking of subchondral bone under cartilage. This hard tissue layer is known to change with age and pathology. Ten 'aged' (71 years) and ten 'young' (47 years) cadaver knee joints were impacted to study the influence of age and pathology on the fracture load, and incidents of occult injury. Our results indicate that fracture load, per se, was independent of specimen age. On the other hand, severely pathological specimens required significantly higher loads to fracture bone. Occult microcraking was also observed in subfracture experiments, however, fewer incidents were recorded for the 'aged' specimens. This type of injury has been associated with knee pain and the development of disease in the chronic setting. These data suggest that a bone fracture criterion based largely on pathological specimens would not provide a conservative measure of tolerance for the normal driving population. INTRODUCTION Traumatic injury is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., surpassed only by heart disease and cancer. Motor vehicle injuries rank second to cancer in total societal cost (2). While recent statistics suggest a lowering of fatalities from motor vehicle accidents (likely due to the mandated use of seatbelts and airbags) (3, 4), more cases of less severe injury are being reported. A high frequency of lower extremity injuries show up with seat belt restrained drivers (5). Recent studies show a high frequency of these injuries with air bags (6). Lower limb injuries may be the most frequent cause of disability and impairment resulting from motor vehicle crashes (7). In a recent study 40% of the total annual motor vehicle trauma treatment charges in Maryland were for lower extremity injuries (8). A complication associated with lower extremity trauma is acute pain followed by a chronic osteoarthrosis (9). Complaints of joint pain immediately following insult to a joint has been reported in approximately 88% of patients eventually progressing to osteoarthrosis (10). Subtle damage to cartilage and subchondral bone can occur without radiographic evidence of bone fracture (11). This damage can exist as fibrillation of the cartilage surface or as 'occult' microcracks in the cartilage-bone interface. Recent studies have focused on identifying occult bone trauma and relating it to clinical findings. "Radiographically occult injuries to the bone, otherwise referred to as occult fractures, bone bruises, or microtrabecular trauma/fracture, may account for patient pain" (12), perhaps by impeding venous drainage through extraosseous veins (13). Engebretsen et al. (14) suggests injury to the anterior cruciate ligament often results in "bone bruises" that can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and provide a basis for joint pain and a subsequent arthrosis. However, a direct association between insult and disease has been difficult because visible evidence of the disease may not show up for years (15). OA (osteoarthrosis, osteoarthritis) is a disease which affects the cartilage and subchondral bone of articulating joints. While the etiology of OA is not wholly understood, it is commonly thought to start as a stiffening (sclerosis) of the bony plate (subchondral bone) underlying the cartilage. This stiffening bone alters the pressure in the overlying cartilage, causing the cartilage to soften (chondromalacia). The softened articular cartilage can swell (edema), and become roughened (pitting edema, fibrillated). This in turn causes increased stiffening and thickening of the subchondral bone and increased softening and thinning of the articular cartilage. Eventually the subchondral bone is layed baredenuded bone) and is converted to a hard, white mass (eburnated bone). This final stage can be detected radiographically as a loss of joint space (joint closure) as cartilage is lost and bone spurs (bony projections) develop. Animal studies have been conducted in order to establish a correlation between mechanical insult and the onset of a progressive disease. Donohue et al. (16) reported changes in the zone of calcified cartilage of the canine patel lo- femoral joint two weeks after transarticular loading at 45% of the energy needed to cause visible fracture of bone. 3144</page><page sequence="2">the canine knee indicated microcracks in the underlying bone at contact pressures exceeding 25 MPa (17). However, a study by Haut(28) indicates that when contact pressures in the human patellofemoral joint reach 25 MPa, on average, gross fracture of bone is evident. Since clinical studies suggest occult microcracks cause OA, one must assume the Figure 1 Arrows denote occult trauma. More recent canine studies report vertically oriented microfractures in calcified cartilage prior to bone fracture, without disruption of the articular surface (16, 17, 18). These researchers suggest that changes in the calcified cartilage and underlying bone form the basis for development of a diseased state in the joint. The hypothesis is consistent with earlier studies of Radin and colleagues who theorize that microdamage and subsequent stiffening of the underlying subchondral bone results in abnormal stresses in the overlying cartilage, leading to a progressive degeneration of this soft tissue layer. Shimizu et al. (19) studied the human tibial plateau and found degradation in the underlying bone preceding changes in the overlying cartilage. A recent clinical study of high energy knee injuries indicate changes in the subchondral bone detected by magnetic resonance imaging that were associated with "overt cartilage loss or defect in 48% of the patients evaluated 6 months after injury" (20). These injuries, which can occur without inclusion of the overlying cartilage surface, provide a form of damage which is undetectable by arthroscopy (21). Intraarticular contact pressure has been correlated with joint damage. A study on the impact response of human cartilage biopsy samples concluded that 25 MPa is a damage threshold for human cartilage (22). A more recent study on contact pressure required to cause occult microcracks must be different between canines and humans. Figure 2.

Specimens with a full and healthy distribution of cartilage were selected for the study. This resulted in a sample pool of seven cadavers aged 46±9 years. The fracture load of each specimen was determined by rigid impacts on one limb at progressively higher velocities in increments of 1 m/s. This resulted in fracture of bone at a contact load of 6.7 kN and a patellofemoral pressure of 15 MPa. The contralateral knee was impacted once with 45% of the energy required for fracture (16), resulting in a contact load of 5.2 kN and a contact pressure of 12 MPa. Occult damage in the form of horizontal microcracking at the cartilage-bone interface was noted in four of seven patellae in both subfracture and fracture experiments (Figure 1). A recent mathematical model (23) developed in our research of the impacted human patellofemoral joint indicates large shear stresses along the zone of calcified cartilage on the lateral patellar facet (Figure 2A, arrow) (1). The location of these large shear stresses in the theoretical model coincide with the location of occult microcracking in the impact experiments. The currently accepted criterion for prediction of a lower extremity injury during a motor vehicle accident is based on bone fracture alone. The injury criterion for knee contact with the instrument panel is 10 kN, based on femur forces measured in an anthropomorphic dummy (24). This criterion is largely based on knee contact forces measured in seated, aged human cadavers during fracture of the femur or the patella (25, 26, 27: Table I). While these studies impacted the knee of a whole cadaver, there were variations in the experimental methods: the use of embalmed and unembalmed cadavers, padded and rigid impact interfaces, single and multiple impacts, moving and stationary cadaver specimens and variations in impact mass. Table I also includes the impact studies by Haut (28) and Atkinson and Haut (29). Haut's (28) fracture loads were less than the automotive criterion. It was suggested this may be due to progressive damage to the skeletal system from multiple impacts. Further, a portion of the impact load in the early whole cadaver studies may have inertially accelerated the cadaver resulting in higher loads than in Haut' s experiments using an isolated joint preparation. However, there is no clear explanation for the relatively lower fracture loads recently documented by Atkinson and Haut (29), since the Haut protocol was used. One major difference between the studies of Haut and Atkinson/Haut is the age of the cadavers. The health of a joint may influence the load carrying capacity of the structure. Cartilage protects bones from intraarticular stresses experienced during loading of the joint. OA is "an almost inevitable consequence of aging"(30) and results in a loss of cartilage and a thickened subchondral plate. We previously developed a static, two dimensional math model of the human patellofemoral joint subjected to loading on the patella. This model (Figure 2) (23) showed the location and magnitude of the highest shear stresses changed when the cartilage layer was replaced with bone (Figure 2B,C). Loading the joint with the cartilage replaced by bone resulted in a 27% reduction in the highest shear stress. With an intact layer of cartilage the largest shear stress was located along the calcified cartilage under the lateral facet (Figure 2A). However, with the cartilage layer replaced by bone, the largest shear stress was located deep in the trabecular bone (Figure 2B). This suggests occult microcracks may be more likely to occur in healthy joints as opposed to pathological joints. A 50% increase in load on the pathological joint (Figure 2C) resulted in a shear stress magnitude similar to the model with cartilage, but these stresses were now located deep in the trabecular bone. Interestingly, this situation resulted in a 29% increase in shear stress in the adjacent femur. Since at these elevated loads relatively higher shear stresses were developed in the femur versus the patella, more split fractures of the femur may show-up using the aged cadaver. This fact is evident in early impact studies using aged cadavers (29). Joint health may also influence the stiffness of the patellofemoral complex. Impact onto a stiff versus a compliant structure would tend to increase the load generated at any given impact intensity (energy). These data are essential for the future development of anthropomorphic dummies with improved biofidelity. Since early impact studies were primarily focused on establishing a fracture threshold for bone, little information exists on joint pathology. Our studies with the isolated knee preparations suggest that aged specimens can tolerate higher loads before fracture. Since the current lower extremity tolerance criterion has largely been based on impact properties of the aged cadaver, it may not be conservative enough to reflect the response of a normal population. Due to clinical associations between joint insult and subchondral bone damage, and our own experimental data documenting occult types of injury from impact on the human knee at subfracture loads, a lower extremity injury criterion based on bone fracture alone may not be a conservative enough measure for the long term health of a diarthrodial joint under blunt insult. The primary objectives of the current study were to conduct fracture and subfracture experiments on 'aged' and 'young' human knee joints to investigate the influence of age on fracture load tolerance and examine each type of joint for the frequency of occult injury. Specifically, we hypothesized: 1) the fracture load of 'aged' human cadaver knees would be greater than 'young' cadavers; 2) subfracture blunt insult to the aged knee would produce fewer incidences of occult microcracks in the calcified cartilage and/or subchondral bone than young specimens with an intact layer of cartilage; 3) intraarticular pressures would not exceed 25 MPa; 4) the stiffness of the knee would be related to the presence or absence of articular cartilage in the patellofemoral joint. METHODS Blunt impact was delivered to isolated, flexed knee joints of twenty cadavers in two phases. Phase I consisted of ten 'young' cadavers aged 48±9, years and Phase II consisted of ten 'aged' cadavers 71+7 years of (Table 2). Portions of Phase I data were previously documented (29). Tissue from an additional four specimens aged 40+22 years (seven patellae), was used as histological controls. Tissues were 3146</page><page sequence="4">procured by the Michigan Tissue Bank. Shortly after death, the patellofemoral joint was examined through a medial inci- sion. Specimens in Phase I were harvested from donors with no prior history of joint trauma and/or evidence of advanced joint pathology (areas of denuded bone, advanced chondro- malacia, etc.). Specimens in Phase II were harvested from specimens exhibiting a wide range of joint pathology; mild chondromalacia to advanced OA involving large areas of denuded bone. Joint preparations were excised approximately 15 cm from the knee proper within 4 hours of death. The specimens were either stored at 4° C in 17mg/ml L-15 culture medium (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) with 85pg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Gibco/BRL, Gaithersburg,MD) or frozen. Superficial tissues proximal to the femoral condyle were excised and the femoral shaft was cleaned with alcohol. The femur was potted in a cylindrical steel sleeve with room temperature curing epoxy, and was mounted to a rigid test frame (28). Each specimen was maintained at a flexion angle of 90° prior to impact with a loosely knotted tether tied to the quadriceps tendon (Figure 3). The knot was such that minimal load was required to cause slippage, thus minimizing tensile loads in the tendon during impact. The patellar facets were brushed with India ink and photographed prior to impact to document any baseline surface roughness or fibrillation of cartilage. A 4.5 kg impact mass was accelerated to a given pre- impact velocity, while aligned on two steel guide rails and supported on four nylon blocks to minimize friction. A 15.3 cm diameter, 6061-T6 aluminum impact interface was mounted to the front of a load transducer (Model 3173-2k, Lebow Products, Troy, MI, USA). While a rigid impact interface does not model the energy absorbing characteristics of an instrument panel, this surface provided baseline results that could be compared to previous studies (28, 26). The impact mass was selected based on a previous study (28). The resonant frequency of the load cell with the impact interface attached was approximately 1300 Hz. Pilot studies indicated that the load transducer and attached mass would not resonate during impact on the human knee. Load data were recorded continuously on a personal computer via a 16 bit A/D board (Model DAS 1600, Computer Boards, Inc., Mansfield, MA, USA). Load data were inertially compensated (31) and sampled at 10,000 Hz.. The impacting mass was accelerated to a predetermined velocity by adjusting pressure in a mass accelerator tank. Velocity of the mass was measured prior to impact on the knee using two infrared optical sensors (Part No. OR518-ND, Digi-Key Corporation, Thief River Falls, MN). These sensors are designed with a 5 Table 2.

A tab connected to the impact mass crossed the 5 mm gap interrupting the first sensor and then the second. The individual sensors were separated by 76.2 mm to eliminate cross-talk. The test protocol consisted of sequentially increasing the velocity of the impact mass, so as to progressively increase the impact energy (3, 11, 22, 38, 61, 88 J). The experiment was terminated when impact loading resulted in a visible fracture of bone. Damage was assessed by visual inspection through lateral and medial incisions in the joint, palpation and documented photographically. The contralateral limb of each specimen was impacted with approximately 45% or 70% of the energy that caused bone fracture in the first limb (16). In Phase I, six specimens were 3147</page><page sequence="5">impacted with a 45% subfracture input energy and 4 impacted with a 70% subfracture energy. In Phase II, seven specimens were impacted with a 45% subfracture input energy and 2 impacted with a 70% subfracture energy. One Phase II subfracture limb was not impacted(H24). Acceleration-time curves were twice integrated to yield compression-time curves. Crossplots of the load-time data and compression-time data yielded a load-compression curve. The slope of the linear region of this curve was calculated as a measure of the overall stiffness of the knee. The stiffness curves were then normalized for comparison of the data. All load values were divided by the peak load. All displacements were divided by the value of the displacement corresponding with the peak load. A medium range (7-40 MPa) pressure sensitive film (Prescale, single sheet, Fuji Film, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the joint prior to each impact through medial and lateral incisions. The film was encased in two sheets of polyethylene film approximately 0.05 mm thick to prevent exposure to body fluids and help reduce shear loading artifacts (32). The strips of film were sufficiently long to pass through the patellofemoral joint and cover the anterior surface of the patella to measure the location and distribution of the contact load on the knee. This also minimized frictional forces between the rigid impactor and the knee. Prior to impact, one mm diameter holes were drilled at the proximal and distal poles through the patella in an anterior to posterior direction. After impact, needle probes were inserted through the holes to pierce the film and help locate position of the film with respect to the patellar facets. The pressure sensitive film was calibrated in a servohydraulic testing machine (Model 1330, Instron, Canton, MA, USA) using a previous methodology (28). The film showed the highest sensitivity over the range of approximately 8 to 30 MPa (33). Briefly, the film was encased in the polyethylene packet and loaded with a 100 ms load-controlled haversine pulse. The analysis of the exposed film was performed with Image 1.44 public domain software (National Institutes of Health, ftp Wayne@helix.nih.gov). The films were analyzed using a video scanner(Model MSF- 300Z, MicroTek International Incorporated, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC) with a sensitivity of 1 1.8 pixels per mm2. The distribution of contact pressures was determined over the patello-femoral joint. The image was divided to analyze the medial and lateral pressures. A characteristic vertex present in most images corresponded to the median patellar ridge separating the image into medial and lateral facets (Figure 4). Technical difficulties during scanning the film from specimen H03 resulted in no pressure or area data from that specimen. HISTOLOGY - Following the mechanical test, or in the case of controls following harvest of the tissues, patellae were placed in 10% buffered formalin for approximately seven days. The tissue was decalcified in 20% formic acid for approximately 14 days. Due to the size of the human patella, only one 2-3 mm block was excised and used in this study (Figure 5). Blocks were cut medial to lateral across the entire patella in an area of high contact pressure adjacent to cartilage and bone trauma. The blocks were processed for routine paraffin embedding.

STATISTICS - The experimental data resulting from analysis of the load-time and the pressure film were analyzed with a commercial statistics package (Excel 5.0, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) to calculate means and standard deviations. The peak contact load, average contact pressure, time to reach peak load and contact duration (pulse) were the dependent variables. Both linear and second-order polynomial functions were used to identify the functional dependence of each dependent variable with impact energy. Correlation coefficients were computed for each fit. Phase I and Phase II contact loads were compared using an unpaired t-test at each impact energy. Statistical significance was set at p=0.05. RESULTS A typical impact on the knee for the Phase I and Phase II (Ph I and Ph II) impacts leading to fracture resulted in a short period of low contact load followed by a sharp rise to a peak in approximately 5 ms (Figure 6). The contact load declined gradually yielding a total contact duration of approximately 10-15 ms. These data did not vary significantly with input energy. The contact forces developed on the knee joints were considered dependent on impact energy. This response was nonlinear (29) resulting in an increasing contact load with increasing impact energy. A second order polynomial was used to correlate peak contact force in successive impacts leading to fracture for impact energies of 3, 11, 22, 38, 61, 88 J. All knee joints did not require the full series of impact energies to fracture. Visible fracture of bone was noted in the range of 22 to 88 J of energy. Peak contact force increased with increasing energy (Ph 1: r2=.79, Ph II: r2=.76) delivered to the knee. The Phase I and Phase II contact force versus energy trends were not different (Figure 7). The average patellofemoral contact pressures increased with increasing energy (Ph I: r2=.85, Ph II: r2=.63) delivered to the knee. The Phase I and Phase II patellofemoral contact pressures versus energy trends were not different (Figure 8). The pressure over the lateral facet was consistently higher than on the medial facet, but no statistical differences were documented. Contact pressures were uniform (standard deviations less than 2 MPa) over the Figure 7 Comparison of Phase I and Phase II contact force vs increasing impact energy Figure 8 Comparison of Phase I and Phase II patellofemoral contact pressure vs increasing impact energy Figure 9 Fracture load vs specimen age facets for the Phase I experiments. Contact pressures for Phase II generally had a standard deviation of 4 MPa. At approximately 59+22 J (Phi) and 53+17 J (Phil) of energy and a contact force of 6.7+1. 7kN (Phi) and 6.7+2.1 kN (Phil) visible fracture of bone was noted (Table 3 and 4). Phase I specimens suffered six transverse fractures of the patella, two comminuted fractures of the patella, one significant disruption of articular cartilage, and one split fracture of the femoral condyle. Phase II specimens suffered seven transverse fractures of the patella, one comminuted fracture of the patella, one femoral shaft fracture, and one specimen with no gross visual damage. A plot of all Phase I 3149</page><page sequence="7">Figure 10 Phase 1 stiffness curves and Phase II fracture load versus age data showed no significant linear or second order trend (Figure 9). The average patellofemoral contact pressure was 16. 5 ±3. 3 MPa (Ph I) and 17.2+5.07 (Ph II), respectively, in these fracture- producing experiments. A characteristic load-compression or stiffness curve for the fracture experiments indicated a high compliance response for approximately 10 mm followed by a sharp, largely linear rise to a peak load. The load then dropped to zero as the displacement returned to zero. The stiffnesses of the linear region for these curves were 1139±256 N/mm (Ph I) and 1248±532 N/mm (Ph II). The shape of the Phase I stiffness curves varied greatly because of the wide range of compression values (8 to 29 mm) at the corresponding peak contact loads (Figure 10). Phase II curves had a smaller range (13 to 23 mm of compression) at the corresponding peak contact loads (Figure 11). The largest stiffness (2250 N/mm) was measured in the most pathologic specimen (H25). All load and compression data were normalized by dividing by their respective values at peak load (Figure 12). This resulted in a characteristic load-compression curve which fit well with a sixth order polynomial curve ( Phi: r2=.92, Phil: r2=.95). There was a low load response until approximately Figure 11 Phase II stiffness curves 0.7 normalized compression, where the response became linear and followed a steep rise to the peak normalized load. Subfracture insult was delivered to the contralateral knee of the fracture knee joint at approximately 45% and 70% of the fracture energy (Table 3 and 4). Six Phase I knee joints were impacted with an energy of 26+11 J (41% fracture energy) and four knee joints were impacted with 39+13 J (73% fract- Figure 12 Normalized stiffness for Phase I and Phase II ure energy). Seven Phase II knee joints were impacted with an energy of 19+3 J (43% fracture energy) and 2 knee joints were impacted with an energy of 51+16 J (66% fracture energy). Subfracture insult resulted in contact loads of 5.3+1.7 kN at 41% fracture energy and 6.3+1.4 kN at 73% fracture energy (Ph I) and 4.5+1.4 kN at 43% fracture energy and 4.8+4.7 at 66% fracture energy (Ph II). The average contact pressure was 12.4+4.4 MPa (Ph I) and 10.62+7.81 (Ph II) for the subfracture experiments. Gross evaluation of the specimens revealed no visible bone fracture in 7 of 10 (Ph I) and 6 of 10 (Ph II) cases. Gross evaluation of the Phase I fracture and subfracture knee joints prior to testing revealed baseline pathology in the form of varying levels of chondromalacia in all patellae. This generally included local softening, mild surface roughness and surface fibrillation of the articular cartilage. No specimens exhibited denuded bone in the contact areas. Phase II specimens exhibited a wide range of baseline pathologies (Figure 13). This included mild to advanced chondromalasia patellae, mild and significant bone spurring, pitting edema of cartilage and areas of denuded and eburnated bone (Figure 13 A). Figure 13.

(Line denotes periphery of the patella). Analysis of the patellar histology from the subfracture experiments revealed occult injuries in seven Phase I and four Phase II specimens (Tables 3,4). The injury was visible at 12 power and was observed in the deep zones of the articular cartilage, the zones of calcified cartilage and the subchondral bone. The traumas were observed as horizontal (parallel to the articulating surface) occult cracks 3150</page><page sequence="8">s s e S •m ■I toc •S G g S. g a o £ -S5 s C3 ^3 S Ö g a u £ *&gt; 03 Q rn Q¿ 3 C3 H &lt;D &lt;D &lt;D &lt;D &lt;D &lt;D C CD C &lt;D &lt;D C C C C O C O C C O O &lt;D &lt;D &lt;D Q 2 ^ &lt;D &lt;D &lt;D 2 &lt;D &lt;D 2 2 bC bi M ^ bß bû M^bC bí-^-0-0 ^ -3 -» cd 13 55 'S 'S S 1,1 ^ ^ ^ 2 -3 2 c E E E 'S 2 'S 2 -a E £ E2E£-O22-U¿ C (í iv y cd cd -o TD .

The cracks were adjacent to baseline articular surface pathology (Figure 1). The characteristic shape was that of an open slit. The cracks were identified as three types. The first type involved a split confined to the subchondral bone (Figure 14) and was observed in three Phase I and zero Phase II specimens. The entire inner surfaces of the split were jagged. The surface of the crack involved a thin layer of subchondral bone still fully intact along the calcified cartilage. The second type of trauma, observed in three Phase I and one Phase II specimens was a Figure 14 Figure 15 Figure 16 split at the subchondral bone and calcified cartilage interface (Figure 15). The edge of the crack along the calcified cartilage was smooth, while the other edge along the subchondral bone was jagged. The third type of trauma was a split at the tidemark (Figure 16) and was observed in one Phase I and two Phase II specimens. Both edges of this crack appeared smooth. Analysis of histological slides from the fractured specimens also revealed occult trauma in five Phase I and three Phase II specimens. The characteristic shape and size of these occult traumas were similar in shape and size to the traumas observed in the subfracture experiments. The cracks were again classified as three types. A split in the subchondral bone was observed in two Phase I and zero Phase II specimens. A split at the subchondral bone and calcified cartilage interface was observed in one Phase I and two Phase II cases. A split at the tidemark was observed in two Phase I and one Phase II specimens. Because the occult fractures were observed after subfracture and fracture experiments, we considered the possibility that these damages were not impact induced, but rather were pre-existent in the joint. To help ensure that these occult damages were experimentally induced and not an artifact of histological preparation, seven unimpacted patellae from four subjects were histologically processed. They were viewed in light microscopy at a range of powers similar to the impacted patellae. Although baseline pathologies existed in the form of articular surface fibrillation, multiplication of tidemark and loss of proteoglycan staining, no horizontal occult traumas were observed. The cartilage, calcified cartilage and subchondral bone appeared intact with no horizontal splits. DISCUSSION We hypothesized that the fracture load of 'aged' human cadaver knees would be greater than 'young' cadavers. A second hypothesis was that occult microcracks would be less frequent in aged specimens following subfracture insult. A third hypothesis was that intraarticular contact pressures would not exceed 25 MPa. A final hypothesis was that the stiffness òf the patellofemoral joint was related to the presence or absence of articular cartilage in the joint The current study indicated that age, per se, was not the primary factor in determining the load required to fracture bone in the knee. Mathematical models suggested that bone- on-bone contact in the patellofemoral joint would result in higher loads than healthy joints with cartilage-on-cartilage contact (23). We assumed that aged Phase II specimens would exhibit some level of bone-on-bone contact due to the preponderance of OA in the elderly. But a majority of the Phase II specimens exhibited a nearly full distribution of cartilage across the joint. However, three Phase II specimens with denuded bone (H10, H20, H25) required loads of 9.5+1.0 kN; significantly higher than the rest of the specimens in the study. The remaining seven Phase II specimens, with the milder pathology, averaged a fracture load of 5.6 kN. All Phase I specimens exhibited a full distribution of cartilage with some mild pathology. While most of these specimens exhibited fracture loads under 8 kN, one Phase I specimen (H04) fractured at 9.4 kN. It is unknown why this specimen withstood abnormally high loads. Our mathematical model of the human joint, without patellar cartilage, indicated that a loss of joint cartilage results in a more effective transfer of load across the PF joint into the femur. Hence relatively low shear stresses would be developed in the patella, and high shear stresses would be generated in the femur. This may explain the split fractures of femoral condyles in Haut, 1989. In order to reach the same levels of shear stress in the patella for a pathological joint, a 50% higher impact load was required, resulting in elevated stress in the femur. This model, then, may help explain the relatively low fracture loads in the current study as compared with Haut' s results (28) using the same protocol. Haut' s fracture load of 8.5 kN is 27% higher than the Phase I and II results in the current study. While Haut does not tabulate the joint health of each specimen, overall comments are made regarding the advanced pathology of the specimens. This 3153</page><page sequence="11">may have resulted in higher fracture loads overall for Haut' s experiments. Our histological findings revealed horizontal, occult fractures involving the subchondral bone, calcified cartilage and articular cartilage at fracture and subfracture loading. Subfracture experiments resulted in loads averaging 5.3 kN (41% fracture energy) and 6.3 kN (73% fracture energy) in Phase I and 4.5 kN (43% fracture energy) and 4.7 kN (66% fracture energy) Phase II. Both subfracture and fracture loads were significantly less than the current lower extremity injury criterion of 10 kN for new automobile certification using anthropomorphic dummies. Subfracture loads were less than those required to produce visible fracture of bone in the contralateral limb. The math model suggests that occult trauma will occur where the soft, compliant cartilage attaches to the bone. We hypothesized that impact experiments with older specimens would not likely result in occult trauma because the compliant cartilage has been converted to bone due to a progressive OA resulting in the highest shear stress deep in the trabecular bone. We observed half as many occult traumas in Phase II (six occult traumas) than Phase I experiments (12 occult traumas). However, seven of ten of Phase II specimens exhibited an almost complete cartilage distribution. Our math model suggests a joint with an intact layer of cartilage can result in high shear stresses at the cartilage-bone interface suggesting non-pathological Phase II specimens would exhibit occult microcracking. One possible explanation for the relatively few occult traumas observed in non-pathological Phase II specimens may be the cartilage of an aged specimen is in the process of thinning as the subchondral plate stiffens. This may result in higher shear stresses away from the cartilage-bone interface, thus preventing an occult trauma. Alternately, Phase I specimens exhibited thick layers of cartilage with no erosion. Of the six Phase II occult traumas, only one was observed in the pathological limbs of the specimens carrying the greatest load to fracture (H10,H20,H25). This result supports our hypothesis that intraarticular bone on bone contact may preclude an occult trauma resulting from blunt impact. Phase I specimens averaged 16.5 MPa at fracture, 8.5 MPa less than the reported damage threshold of cartilage (22) and 8.5 MPa less than that resulting in fracture of bone for aged specimens (28). A relatively low pressure of 16.5 MPa may be due to the presence of a full and healthy cartilage distribution resulting in an even distribution of the impact force and a lower contact pressure. Phase II specimens averaged 17.2 MPa at fracture. This pressure data from aged specimens may be elevated due to intraarticular incongruities caused by bone spurring and hard, denuded bone. The stiffness results for Phase I experiments were much less variable than from Phase II experiments. This may be due to the greater variance in the pathology of the older specimens. Phase II specimens included specimens that ranged from a full cartilage distribution to specimens with denuded bone. Phase I specimens were largely healthy (full cartilage layer) resulting in a test population of more similar specimens. A comparison of stiffness values at fracture and corresponding joint pathology suggests that bone-on-bone (H25) contact can result in a higher stiffness than cartilage- on-cartilage (H23) contact, irrespective of age. The normalized load-compression curve depicts the characteristic shape of the stiffness of the 90 degree flexed knee to impact loading. This shape consisted of a period of low load response extending 70% of the entire deformation.. This was followed by a sharp rise to peak load in the final 30% of the deformation. The period of low load response may be a combination of the deformation of compliant subcutaneous tissues on the anterior patella, the compression of cartilage, a tensioning of the patellar tendon and/or a proximal migration of the patella. The sharp linear rise to peak load may be due to the compression of the harder bone. Normalization of the data removes the biovariability evident in the raw stiffness curves. The effects of joint geometry, joint pathology and other variables are removed to produce a characteristic response. It is unknown if this data will aid in the improved biofidelity of anthropomorphic dummies, although it may aid in comparing data from different impact studies. A benefit of the current study was that impaction of the isolated knee joint resulted in load and stiffness data specific to the knee joint. This could be contrasted with impaction of the whole body which introduces questions regarding the specific contribution of various body tissues and even motion of the body itself. Progressively greater impact energies (velocities) in the current fracture experiments allowed a better determination of the fracture load. An alternate method might have been to impact only once at the same median energy for all specimens. However, due to the range of fracture loads observed in Phase I and II experiments (4 to 10 kN) impacting all specimens with the same impact energy may have resulted in a subfracture load for some specimens and catastrophic failure in others. Gross and histological documentation of the pathology of the specimens allowed correlation of joint health to impact response. Histological processing also allowed us to investigate the frequency of occult microcracks resulting from blunt impact. To our knowledge, only our previous study (29) documented controlled, experimentally induced, occult microcracks at the cartilage-bone interface in the human knee. Previous studies (25,26,27) impacted the human cadaver knee with similar experimental methods, but microtrauma of the joint tissues was not investigated. A limitation of the current study was the location of histological sectioning. Due to the size of the patella only a 3mm block was excised for sectioning. While this sectioning method resulted in the observation of occult traumas in both fracture and subfracture experiments, other sections may have shown occult damage in the remaining cases. In addition, it is still unknown at which energy or contact load occult damages actually occurred during the experiments. While past studies have used repeated impacts on the human cadaver (25,28) "this technique introduces the uncertainty of progressive predamage to the skeletal structure"(27). The current study was also limited to a rigid interface condition. While this type of interface was used by Powell (26), whose data largely serves as the basis for the current injury criterion, automotive occupants commonly interact with more deformable structures. During this more typical situation some portion of the contact load might be supported by structures surrounding the patella, such as the femoral 3154</page><page sequence="12">condyles (28). Furthermore, it is known that for more rigid impacts, femur loads in the current anthropomorphic dummy typically exceed those measured in a human cadaver under similar impact conditions (34). Thus, while occult traumas have been reported in cadavers for loads less than the current injury criterion, the direct applicability of these data to the automotive setting using anthropomorphic dummies needs further clarification. Tomatsu et al. (35) recently reported horizontal occult split fractures comparable to the current study during shear loading of the porcine femoral condyle. The horizontal microcracks we observed closely resemble his IB and IIB injury classifications. That study suggests the location of trauma is dependent on the mass and velocity of the impactor. Tomatsu concluded that high impact speeds and light masses tend to rupture the cartilage resulting in open lesions, while low impact speeds and high masses more often generate occult damage in the underlying bone. As the speed is increased, combined injury to the bone and cartilage is expected. The higher speeds used in our fracture group also resulted in visible fractures of bone and gross disruption of the articular cartilage. It is possible the occult traumas recorded in the fractured specimens may have been produced in one of the subfracture impacts at a lower velocity, and therefore, lower energy. The results of Tomatsu et al. suggest that the occult microfractures observed in the current study could be due to our use of a relatively large mass and a corresponding low velocity of impact. Since impact trauma during an automobile collision often occurs at speeds of 30 mph or more, it may be questioned whether these occult traumas would be generated. Clinical studies of joints, however, suggest the possible presence of microfractures at the tidemark or in subchondral bone by the documentation of so called "bone bruises" (20). Our recent mathematical analysis of the human patellofemoral joint also indicates high levels of shear stress developed in bone underlying the lateral patellar facet during impact loading (36). This being the most common area of occult microfracture suggests that excessive shear stresses may be the major factor causing these injuries. Interestingly, our studies indicate that these occult microfractures occur under and adjacent to existing surface pathology. Since other studies indicate that bone seems to remodel before histological changes occur in the overlying cartilage (37,19), perhaps these specimens were predisposed to microcracks because of a weakened subchondral bone plate. On the other hand, a weakened and fibrillated layer of cartilage could also expose the underlying subchondral bone to localized areas of high shear stress during the blunt insult. A recent study by Li et al. suggests that the distribution and location of the highest shear and mean stresses in the patella may depend on both severity and angle of the impacting load on the knee (38). The "young" and "aged" knees in the current study presented a wide range of pathologies resulting in a range of fracture thresholds. Future study on the influence of pathology on impact tolerance may help in the development of a more conservative fracture load for the knee. In addition, the use of padded impact interfaces and a range of knee flexion angles may also influence the fracture threshold. Past studies have used a variety of padded interfaces (25,26,27,28) and a range of flexion angles. Increased padding (27) and flexion angle (28) appear to increase the fracture load threshold. Haut impacted the isolated patellofemoral joint of fresh cadavers using rigid and padded impactors at a range of flexion angles. Successively higher energy impacts were delivered with the knee flexed at either 60°, 90° or 1 10°. Impact with the rigid interface over all flexion angles yielded a fracture load of 8.5 kN. Impacts using a padded interface resulted in a fracture load of 9.5 kN. A flexion angle of 110° using a padded interface resulted in the highest recorded load of 14.4 kN. Fracture was noted as mostly split fracture of the patella or condyle and one comminuted fracture of the patella. Fuji pressure sensitive film was used in the current study and a number of others (11,14,17) to record intra- articular contact pressures. The accuracy of the film in transducing pressure gradients is reported to be 10 MPa/mm for the more commonly used dual layer type of film (39). Since pressures in the current study predominantly ranged from 9 to 25 MPa for the fracture and subfracture impacts, the film functioned in its most sensitive range. Dynamic calibration of the pressure-sensitive film has been performed in the rabbit knee by the product of contact pressure and patellofemoral contact area (33). A similar calculation in the current study was difficult because the human patellar facets are more complex and largely inclined with respect to the line of the impacting force (28). Much of the data generated in the I960' s and 70' s with aged cadaver specimens may not have provided conservative estimates of the load needed to cause bone fracture in the normal population. Since Patrick, et al. (25) noted: "The fact that all of the subjects used exceeded fifty years of age and that all were embalmed should render the foregoing data somewhat conservative...". It was thought at the time of these earlier studies that aged cadavers may be a conservative benchmark for lower extremity injury. Perhaps as important as the fracture load threshold, the current lower extremity injury criterion does not take into account the possibility of microcracking at the cartilage-bone interface or within the subchondral bone at subfracture loads (1). This type of injury has been associated with knee pain and the development of disease in the chronic setting. These data may be especially important in the future because of an increase in the frequency of non life threatening injuries and costs associated with the long term care of patients suffering with joint diseases such as post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
