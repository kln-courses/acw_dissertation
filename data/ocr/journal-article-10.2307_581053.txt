<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 INTRODUCTION The leading archaeological event of the past year was undoub- tedly the exhibition at the National Museum in Athens of the finds from the Mycenean tombs at Aidonia near Phlious. The material itself-gold rings and other objects-is impressive in its own right, but the exhibition is all the more noteworthy for the fact that it includes, as well as the material discovered in the excavations conducted by the Archaeological Service, the material taken earlier by illegal excavators which eventually found its way to the United States, from where it was success- fully recovered on behalf of the Greek State. New discoveries in Greece include more Macedonian tombs, particularly in the cemeteries of Pella, but these are not as impressive as those excavated in the previous year. There have been more underwater discoveries, generally cargoes of wine amphoras: that off Halonnesos is relatively intact (1500 amphoras, together with wood from the boat itself) and is said to be the earliest Classical ship discovered in the Aegean. Meanwhile the bronze female statue found last year off Kalymnos (no more have been found there) has been cleaned and judged to be a Hellenistic original. Of major importance during the past year have been Dr Spyropoulos' excavations at the villa of Herodes Atticus at Eva (Astros), with excellent finds of sculpture and mosaic. In Athens the work for the new Metro system continues: excavation for the station at the Evangelismos Hospital uncovered a Hellenistic cemetery, whose occupants may well include former owners of the land now occupied by the British School. More seriously, the tunneling work has caused problems. In the National Gardens a 15m section of the Valerian Wall disappeared into a col- lapsed shaft, one of many in that area which date from antiquity, and whose exact location is often uncharted. A particular threat was envisaged at the Kerameikos, where the tunnel was planned to pass a mere three metres below the Sacred Gate, and through ground known to be unstable, with well shafts that penetrated at least as deep as the projected tunnel. Protests were raised by the Archaeological Service, the Academy, the Archaeological Society and the Directors of the Foreign Schools, resulting in a slight change of alignment and a greater depth for the tunnel. At the moment it is not clear whether this will succeed in doing what is necessary to avert the danger. Less publicized, but equally threatening, is the danger to the theatre and sanctuary at Dodona posed by the construction of the 'New Egnatian Way', a motorway linking the west and east coasts of Greece, which is scheduled to pass close by, with constant heavy traffic shaking the ancient structure and polluting the atmosphere and the peaceful environment. This is the second and last 'Archaeology in Greece' compiled by me. I am grateful to all those who have sent me reports of their work in the past year. As usual, I have also included material taken from the Deltion of the Archaeological Service. This year, two years' reports, each year in two volumes, have appeared simultaneously, ADelt 44 covering (normally) 1989 and ADelt 45 covering 1990, though both may include reports of continuous work which extended over several years. This has meant a total of some 1,200 pages of reports from the Prehistoric and Classical, Byzantine, and specialist Ephorates. It is good that ADelt has thus reduced the gap between excavation and publication, though this has meant in turn much last minute work for AR, and consequent conden- sation and exclusion of detail. It has also reduced the space available here for other material, as well as the time to search for it. As last year, I have not given page references to ADelt, since the sites described can easily be found in the reports of the appropriate Ephorate: I have made clear from which of the two volumes the report is taken. I am grateful to David Turner, who once again has prepared the excerpts from the reports of the Byzantine Ephorates, and to the Librarian of the British School, Penny Wilson Zarganis, who produced the list of new publications. I am also grateful to my student, Elena Partida, who prepared the excerpts taken from the Ergon of the Archaeological Society. Preparing Archaeology in Greece is a time-consuming effort for the Directors of the British School, and this was noted in the Academy Review of the Schools: it certainly takes up time and effort which might otherwise be devoted to original research. It was particularly gratifying, therefore, to receive letters of thanks from a number of colleagues, after last year's report, who emphasized how useful they found them. They are, of course, an excellent indication of the amount and breadth of archaeological fieldwork which is being carried out in Greece each year. But there is more to it than this. I have found it a great pleasure, even if, at the end of my academic career, it was one I did not foresee, to be part of the stimulating environment that is archaeology in Greece. The greatest debt is to our Greek colleagues, who make us all so welcome. This is a privilege, and one that is most prized. It is through this that the second stimulus exists, the presence in Athens of the foreign Schools. The great variety of meetings, lectures, seminars, exhibitions, from our Greek hosts, from the various Schools, gives a wide-ranging richness to archaeological work here. It was, therefore, with some incredulity that I read the Anniversary Address of the outgoing President of the Society of Antiquaries of London, commenting on the British Schools abroad, first Athens, founded in 1886, then Rome, in 1901, followed by others that 'sprang up in the brief twilight of cultural imperialism' after the second World War, and ques- tioning whether 'heavy investment in real-estate and infra- structure' is ' cost-effective". Of course it is. It helps create this intellectual excitement, by no means limited to archaeol- ogy, shared not merely by the privileged Directors of the Schools, but by the hundreds of students and scholars we support each year. Here we have what is effectively an international University for archaeology and Greek Studies. Nothing here of 'cultural imperialism' but rather of Europaean, and wider, cooperation. Long may it continue. NEW PUBLICATIONS From the Archaeological Service: Demosieumata Series of the Archaeological Service: 53. M. Lilibake-Akamate, Laxeutoi thalamotoi taphoi tes Pellas.

At the Propylaia the LR cistern was cleared in 1989 and the architectural fragments found in it, almost all marble or poros, were laid in rows E and SE of the NW building. (ADelt 44) In 1990, in preparing footings for a crane, two trenches were opened between the Propylaia and the Erechtheion, revealing scanty remains of rough stone walls. Finds included material of MH, LH, A, C and later date. (ADelt 45) Agora. John McK. Camp reports on the excavations of the ASCS: "In the Panathenaic Way we continued the exploration of the C levels of the road. The composition of the road fills changes dramatically over time. In the 4th Ct levels we had standard road metal with packed gravel making up an occa- sionally rough but well-worn surface. In the second half of the 5th Ct, however, the road fills were far more carefully pre- pared. The earth was evidently screened to remove almost all stones larger than 3-5cm across, and the resultant fill was laid smooth and then packed hard. Some 15 of these specially prepared surfaces were investigated, representing only half a metre or so of depth, and all apparently dating to the second half of the 5th Ct BC. It is not entirely clear why such pains were taken to produce such a fine series of surfaces at this</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 period. Below were three or four more hard, gravelly road surfaces and beneath that a very deep loose fill of sand and gravel deposited in the second quarter of the 5th Ct. This deep fill would seem to represent a major rearrangement following the Persian sack of Athens in 479 BC. The fill contained several bronze arrowheads, a few broken bits of early architec- ture, and signs of burning. Time and a high water table prevented us from getting below this heavy fill to see if the road followed the same course in the A period. It seems possible that it did not and once took a more southerly route across the agora. In none of the road surfaces did we encounter ruts or any sign that wheeled traffic used the road in the C period. N of Hadrian St, we continued our exploration of the levels overlying the C commercial building which lined the E side of the street, leading N from the agora between the Stoa Poikile and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite. More of both the W and E walls of the third room from the S were found, along with the remnants of a handsome cement-lined basin built into its NE corner. The building was in use from the early 4th Ct until the 1st Ct AD. Each shop has its own stratigraphic sequence reflecting the history of that particular unit, and this season we did not excavate any undisturbed floor levels from the period of use of the building. In the fill overlying the floors of room 3 and the area to the N, several outstanding terracotta pieces were found: a tiny gilded relief figure of a dancing maenad; an unusually well-modelled head of a horse, reminiscent of those on the Parthenon frieze; and a piece showing in relief a satyr moving right in a pose and style which comes very close to the figures of the Lysikrates monument. The suggestion that at least one of the shops produced and sold terracotta figurines is further borne out by a small deposit from behind the building to the NE. Here a shallow pit was found, full of fragmentary pottery, pieces of terracotta figurines, and several moulds. The date of the pottery, coins, and lamps found with the terracottas was second half of the 1st Ct and early 2nd Ct AD. One lamp, showing two gladiators and a Latin inscription was clearly an import, and similar examples have been found as far away as south Gaul. Several of the pieces of pottery were also imported. The terracottas include a head of Pan, the head of a grotesque, and fragments of arms, legs, and drapery of assorted hollow figurines, many of them made from very worn moulds. There are also several fragments of four-spoked wheels, presumably for attachment to toy horses and the like. The mould for making these wheels, of the appropriate diameter, was recovered from the same pit, along with the front and back moulds for an armed figure, and the front mould for a boar. The new deposit should be of some significance as it partially fills a gap in our knowledge of the active Athenian figurine industry. Numerous deposits allow us to trace the history and development of the workshops and their products from the 4th to 1st Ct BC and again in the 3rd and 4th Ct AD, but hitherto the 1st and 2nd Ct AD have been poorly represented. After the abandonment of the C commercial building in the 1 st Ct AD the area was next used in the LR period. Only small patches of stratified fills and tiled or mortared floors of the 4th and 5th Ct AD-together with small stretches of walls which form no coherent plan-survived the extensive habitation and use of the area in the 10th and 11th Ct AD. The large drain in the street immediately to the W shows a long history with numerous renovations, also in the LR period. It had big U- shaped tiles at the bottom, with side walls built of flat tiles and shallow curving cover tiles. Coins and lamps found in the silt which eventually choked the drain suggest that it went out of use in the 6th Ct AD, as did a shallow well found just to the E. This abandonment in the 6th Ct is presumably associated with the Slavic invasion of the 580s, evidence for which was encountered last season further to the N. There are indications of more substantial LR remains W of the N-S street, and it may be that this area saw only secondary and peripheral use. W of the Stoa Poikile we completed the clearing of the late A well, first begun in 1994. Collapsing bedrock made it necessary to shore up the top 2m of the shaft, which below the collapse was cut through bedrock and lined with stones. The interior diameter of the well was .92m and the depth 5.80m. The lowest .75m contained the period of use fill, numerous coarse ware amphoras, kadoi and pitchers which were dropped or broken as water was drawn from the well. Above that was a layer ca .75m thick, full of pottery of a different character: along with coarse wares there were numerous pieces of BG pottery and about a dozen figured pieces. Much of the pottery was recovered intact or mended up to whole shapes and it seems clear that it was all deliberately discarded. The range of shapes and quality suggests that it represents all the pottery one might expect to find in a single Athenian household. The date of the material ranges from 510 to 480 BC. The figured pieces are of high quality, almost all of them appropriate for the symposium. There were six rf cups or kylikes. Three show young men in various poses and are close in style to the cup painters in the Epeleios group and Skythes. Though perhaps painted by different individuals these three pieces are very close in shape and size and may well represent a set, bought all together from a single workshop. The fourth cup has an owl, the fifth an unusual wheel motif, and the sixth may have been bought for the young heir of the house: it is much smaller and has scenes of youths duelling without weapons, painted in an almost cartoon style. There is also a very large bf skyphos, big enough to have served as a small krater, decorated with banqueters, musicians and birds. To pour and keep the wine there was a rf pelike and a bf trefoil oinochoe. The pelike, perhaps painted by the Nikoxenos painter, was decorated with two single figures: on one side is a strolling musician carrying his lyre, perhaps on the way to a party; on the other side a youth recovers from the party by sticking his fingers down his throat. The oinochoe, close in style to the Athena painter, shows a seated, armed Athena being approached by Herakles leading up a bull, watched by Hermes. A small BF amphoris- kos has a Dionysiac assembly. An unusual piece is the handsome phiale decorated within with six spotted bulls done in added red or white, with no incision, apparently in imitation of a metal prototype. Similar phialai are known from the Athenian acropolis, but they are not common. This phiale and a terracotta relief protome of a goddess are the only pieces with possible cult associations; even though the well is less than 10m N of the altar of Aphrodite, the vast majority of the material is appropriate for regular domestic use. Above this mass of pottery there was a deep layer of stones, apparently from the collapse of the lining to the upper part of the shaft, and above that a layer of broken bedrock. Together these two layers would seem to represent the deliberate destruction and filling of the well, presumably at the hands of the Persians in 479 BC. At the top was an additional fill , dug last year, with more fragmentary pottery which seems to represent cleaning-up operations when the Athenians returned; the wall of an early C house was then built partially over the mouth of the old abandoned well. The group is of interest as it provides one of our most complete pictures of the range of coarse, fine, and figured pottery to be found in an Athenian household of 510- 480 BC." Library of Hadrian. Work in 1989 was directed to the study of the remaining elements from later buildings (LByz 3</page><page sequence="4">4 R. A. TOMLINSON and Ott), to the uncovering of the preserved R phase of the S wing of the W facade, and to the study of the substructure of the propylon and the sub-foundations of the W wall and peristyle. Excavations were also carried out E of the propylon. Between the 10th and 14th columns from the N of the W peristyle the euthynteria, of poros slabs, was found to be preserved. Between the 11th and 12th columns, part of the marble stylobate was in situ, and between the 13th and 16th columns the poros rainwater drain of the R courtyard. Between the 11th and 14th columns were the remains of a M to LByz building, similar to others of the period. The narthex of the church of Agios Asomatos was found at the N of the propylon and W peristyle, with tombs which had been cut into the cement footings of the propylon and covered by the marble floor of the narthex. Finds in the graves indicate a long period of use, between the 13th and 17th Cts AD. Burial stopped in the 18th Ct with the construction here of the house of the Voivode. Skeletal remains were found of at least 50 individuals-men, women and children-probably members of the Chalkokondyle family to whom the church belonged. It was found that the W wall of the library was buttressed on the interior by massive brick-built supports, on which were traces of brick-built arches strengthening the interior face of the W wall. The spaces between were filled with architectural fragments. A LHL-ER house was found under the W peristyle of the library, with rooms and a large section of its courtyard between the 13th and 17th columns. The W part of this house was destroyed in the construction of the library. Fragments of painted plaster were found throughout, some patterned. They have been reassembled as a decorative scheme of mustard- yellow coloured squares with black bands and white flowers, below which was a black and white lozenge pattern imitating marble veneer. On one fragment was a face, probably of an actor, and on others two Greek letters. The wall painting is 1st Ct AD. Excavation of Med and PMed walls produced much reused material, architectural fragments, inscriptions, dedications and grave reliefs, and sculpture in the round. The most important was a headless statue of Nike, over lifesize, of the Victoria Romana type. (ADelt 44) In 1990, in front of the L anta of the entrance an inscription was found packed into the ancient road surface: [NEPQNOE] / KAIZAPOE / NEOY AIOAAQNOE. (ADelt 45) Elsewhere in the Plaka, excavations at Odos Tripodon 28, in conjunction with the conservation of this neo-classical building (the Hellenike Hetaireia) revealed a section of the ancient Street of the Tripods, 12.50m long by 1.20 to 1.80m wide (out of an original width of ca 6m). Along the W side of the street was part of the foundations and wall of a large choregic monument, of poros and limestone, partly incorpor- ated into the structure of the neo-classical building. A Med storage pit, one of two found, had destroyed part of the foundation of the choregic monument. At Odos Erechtheos 11 an inscription was found built into the wall of a LByz building: EYEPFE]THI / AAPIANQI / OAYMnIIQI / KYZIK[HNOI]; this must have come from the nearby Pantheon. At the corner of Odoi Panos and Dexippou, a 4m length of the peribolos of the R agora was uncovered. (ADelt 44) It is reported that in 1990 some 900 movable stone antiquities were found during rescue excavations in the Plaka. At Odos Metroon 8 to 12, a further part of the S wall of the S stoa of the R Eleusinion was excavated, badly damaged by later construction and pits. At Odos Polygnotou 3 a marble boundary stele was found in the surface of the road that probably ran S from the R agora. (ADelt 45) Excavations in 1990 by the University of Athens at the Acropolis Studies Centre found more of the road leading from the area of the Sanctuary of Dionysos. Excavations by the Archaeological Service revealed a 10m length of an E-W road with at least ten surfacings and in use from late C to early Byz times. To the E it probably met the road from the Sanctuary of Dionysos. (ADelt 45) Excavations at Odos Platonos and Keratsiniou revealed part of a cemetery lining the road that lead from the Dipylon to the Academy. Finds included a late HL kioniskos with the inscrip- tion: SIMON / EXETIMOY / XAAKIAEQZ / OYFATHP. Elsewhere in Odos Platonos, three tombs of 4th Ct-HL date were found, along with remains of a funerary peribolos; tomb 2 included a rf pyxis of 370-360 BC. In overlying deposits there was a tombstone with a 1st Ct BC inscription: AIPOAI- EIOE . AAPOAIZIOY . MIAHZIOE. (ADelt 44) At Odos Agiou Orous were remains of an early 5th Ct coroplast's workshop, comprising three tanks for refining the clay and a floor. In the deposit which covered the floor was a figurine of a woman on a throne, and fragments of others, of early 5th Ct date. At Odos Lenormant 200 were nine tombs of the 4th Ct BC and fragments of two later parallel walls. (ADelt 44) More of the cemeteries lining the road from the Kerameikos to the Academy, and part of the road itself, were found in rescue excavations in 1990. At Odos Platonos 107 part of the peribolos of the Academy was found, dating to the 4th Ct BC, with four courses preserved to a height of 1.64m and with a thickness of 1.40-1.44m. It was covered with a deposit dating after the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct AD. (ADelt 45) On the S side of the ancient city, excavations in the vicinity of the South Gate have revealed more evidence for the fortifications. This includes a section of the Themistoklean wall, the 4th Ct wall with its ditch and proteichisma, and later rebuilding, of the 2nd Ct BC and the time of Justinian, when a tower was added to the existing wall. The proteichisma is 10m in front of the 4th Ct wall, to which it belongs. Parts of its fronting wall are well preserved, to a height of 5.35m in Odos Tsami Karatson. Here the ditch in front of the proteichis- ma is 8.70m deep, and is filled with natural deposits rather than the tipped rubbish found elsewhere. In this area a large part of the exterior and interior wall of the W side, and a smaller part of the S side of a large building dating to the 2nd Ct AD, were found. The walls are ca 1.10m thick and the scale of construction indicates its public character. The building was in use until the Herul destruction in the 3rd Ct. (ADelt 45) Near the Evangelismos Hospital work for the Metro in 1995 revealed a HL cemetery and part of a building material workshop dating to the 1 st-2nd Ct AD. (Press report) In similar work in the National Garden a wall painting of the 6th-7th Ct AD was found in 1995. The press reported conservation work at the church of Agia Eirene in Odos Aiolou, which uncovered an ECh grave, suggesting that the church was built on the site of a a signifi- cant ECh monument. ATTICA (2nd Ephorate and Eleusis and Megara) Agrileza. A brief campaign of limited excavation was under- taken by J. Ellis Jones in cooperation with Dr E. Kakovoyian- nis of the 2nd Attica Ephorate of Classical antiquities, who report: "Excavation was concentrated on washeries A and B. Washery A is the westernmost of the three at the site, each one of which is an integral part of a separate 'factory' compound.</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 Washery A is a good example of a rectangular washing-table, some 6 x 12m overall. It has a well preserved standtank at the N end. Work at washery A in 1995 was directed first to reclean the washery floor and channels and then to excavate the remaining fill in the standtank, the sedimentation basins and the rebailing basin. Over 30 samples were taken from these locations; some were small fragments of the various plaster layers which had lined the tank and the basins, but most were earth 'cores' taken with hollow metal pipes driven into the fill before its removal. The clearance also completed the excavation of washery A, and supplementary measurements were taken. Washery B was found to be of a different type, with only one sunken channel in front of the standtank that led, through a runnel below the W side wall, to an external system of two more channels and two square sedimentation basins which lay outside, behind, and uphill of the washery; finally, a longer runnel underneath the much damaged rear wall of the washery had linked the eastern sedimentation basin to the rebailing tank alongside the washing-floor. It therefore belonged in plan to the so-called type II of rectangular washery, of which several examples have been cleared in the Lauriotiki by Dr Kakavoy- iannis. In the course of excavation a displaced round column base was re-set in position, located by a gap in the 'cobbled' foundation for the plaster surface in the damaged drying floor. This suggested that there had been a shed roof over the standtank end of the washery (much as at washery C, where three column bases in line made that conjecture fairly certain). Over 50 samples were taken from washery B. Some were again samples of structural materials, plasters and aggregates from tank linings and floors; most were 'core' and trowelled samples of various layers of soil and sandy fills; and others were hardened accretions taken from the floors or sides of channels. Perhaps the most significant will be the samples of concreted deposit ('tailings') from within the closed runnel which linked the first two open channels of the circulation system. After the excavation J. Ellis Jones undertook the washing, sorting and preliminary study of the pottery at Laurion Museum. The one small find was a bronze 20 drachma coin of 1894, indicative of the period of modern mining activities, and probably of disturbance of the ancient remains. All other finds were of potsherds. There were a few bg sherds of 4th Ct BC type, rather more coarse ware, and several fragments of R water jars. The pottery in general from washery B suggests that though it was of a type different from washeries A and C it was broadly contemporary in its construction and use." Aegosthena. Excavations were carried out in 1990 at the central gate of the N side. Clearing of rubble dumped in the gateway revealed the opening and the threshold. The gateway is 2.45m wide, with jambs 0.67m wide. The threshold is made from three slabs and has sockets for the hinges of the double doors behind the jambs. A short section of the S wall was uncovered in the construction of a drainage ditch alongside the coast road. There are indications of a tower. (ADelt 45) Alimos. At Odos Helikonidon and Palaistines part of a Byz building including reused C material was excavated. Finds date it to MByz (coins of the 10th and 11th Cts AD). It was probably the store-place either for a rich landowner or a monastery. Reused material included a headless statue of a lion and a funerary kioniskos with the inscription: AY [...] TH / (HM[...]NIKOY / EPXIEfQ / KY BE[P]NIAOa / AAIMOY- ZIOY / FYNH. (ADelt 44) Brauron. Part of a late R cemetery containing 25 graves of the 3rd Ct AD was found on the E. Metaxa building plot. (ADelt 44) Eleusis. Nine excavations are reported in ADelt 44 and a further six in ADelt 45. In 1989, at Odos Papagianni part of a N-S road was found, with five surfacings. To the E, 700m from the ancient town, is a cemetery, the first discovered in this area. Forty-two graves were excavated, mostly A or C. A peribolos was constructed in C times. There are remains of a funerary monument and sculpture (thigh of a marble kouros). At the Odos Ethnikis Antistaseos (the central road of modern Eleusina) part of a cemetery dating back to the 7th Ct was excavated. All the early burials were of children, some without offerings, some with SG or EPC pottery. It continued with child and adult burials to the end of the C period. Later burials disturbed earlier ones. A C funerary peribolos had been destroyed by a flood, scattering material which included a marble lekythos, decorated with a young hunter with petasos, cloak and javelin in front of an old man seated on a chair and wearing a himation. After the abandonment of the cemetery a masssive retaining wall, probably for a stream, was built across the site, and LR tombs were dug behind this. At Odos Persephone part of a R bath building was found, with remains of praefurnium, caldarium and tepidarium. At Odos Thanasoulopoulos, 30m E of the enclosure fence of the Archaeological Zone, excavations revealed two phases of R structures, walls, floors and drains of the lst-2nd Cts AD. (ADelt 44) In 1990, during improvement of the seafront in Odos Kanellopoulou, a R bath building was found and excavated, forming a series of rectangular rooms and spaces. Rooms to W and SW were cisterns and cold baths, there was a large central room identified as the apoduterion or (more probably) the recreation room, N and E rooms being the hot and warm rooms. The furnace was outside the excavated area. At the junction of Odos Demetros and Ethnikis Antistaseos more of the R aqueduct (AR 1993-4, 9) was found: the continuous footing and the beginning, at intervals, of the piers which carried the arcading, all of mortared stone. The lack of other finds here show that this area was outside the ancient town. At Odos Eroon Polytechneiou, part of the ancient road from Eleusis to Thebes was uncovered, having seven surfacings, of which the second was particularly long-lived. The road fell into disuse in the R period. Perhaps the most significant discovery in 1990 was the excavation at Odos Arkadiou, 1300m NW of the acropolis, of an EH settlement, the first discovery of remains of this date other than a few scattered sherds. Walls 0.5m thick are of EHII date. Coarse pottery had in some instances a deep red coating. Fine ware included burnished and a few dark-on-light sauce- boats. The overall impression is of an agricultural settlement exploiting the surrounding land. (ADelt 45) M. Kosmopoulos reports in the Ergon of the AS for 1995 that soundings on the SW slope of the hill revealed a R cistern and part of a C settlement. Although successive layers of all the PR periods were profiled, no architectural remains were yielded. It is significant, though, that the first stratified ceramic finds from EH Eleusis have been acquired. At Ano Eleusina, between Eleusina and Mandra, at Odos Zapheiri Kalatha, during trenching for the Water Company, a cemetery was found with tile graves and an underground mortared structre, not a tomb and probably a cistern. There was also a rectangular ChT, probably vaulted, built of large worked 5</page><page sequence="6">6 R. A. TOMLINSON stone and baked brick. Finds included three jugs and a lamp, dated to the 2nd half of the 6th Ct AD. The walls included three reused Attica marble grave stelai, the first inscribed: ...MHTPIAAA / MIAHZIA and bearing a relief of a woman, frontal, wearing a long himation, and a small servant girl to the left, with a pyxis. The second has a relief of the dead man, seated, greeted by two females, the third a naked young man in a boat with a bird-prow. (ADelt 44) Glyka Nera. The press report the discovery in 1995 of the dromos of a Myc tomb, the chamber of which is still concealed under the adjacent road. Koropi. At the Health Centre part of the EH settlement was excavated. The pottery includes EH IIB. (ADelt 44) Press reports in 1995 give information about the discovery at the same place, and adjacent to the EH settlement, of a cemetery dating from the late 8th to the late 5th Ct BC. Lambrika. The site extending south of the settlement has been identified with the anc. settlement of Kathyperthen Lamptron. Surveys have shown a longer period of Byz and PByz settle- ment around the church of St. Luke and the Hagia Triada monastery. The area has been declared an archaeological zone. (ADelt 45) Remains of a Byz settlement have also been located at the Ennea Pyrgoi site near Kalybia, including possible remains of a fortification tower. The site, which included the well-known churches of Hagios Petros and the Panagia Mesosporitissa, has been declared an archaeological zone. (ADelt 45) Laureotiki. In the area between Phougaro, Loutsa and Spelia were found four farms and a square tower, with the founda- tions and two courses of large marble blocks preserved. The tower, one of a series at Agrileza also belonged to a farm. (ADelt 45) At Agios Georgeos Thorikou a large building belonging to the cult of Demeter was found in 1990. Rooms contained much equipment, including basins, amphoras, pithoi, mortars, kanth- aroi, lamps, skyphoi and small phialai. There was a kernos in the NW corner of the building. The material is mostly 4th Ct, with some of the 2nd half of the 5th Ct. (ADelt 45) At Kiteza Kalyviou an area of houses, a well and building material belongs to a large farm. Amongst the finds is an inscribed slab: 'ETiC rFXaui7ctucou &amp;pXovro[;] / 6po; Xcopio) Kai oilca; tcpot / KO6; n1u-6i0ct Mv aL6pXou / 'AkXo(o Ovycarpi XH / toitro oTConTi 6ao1ot nk/ovo; &amp;tlov tj Tot; / XpetioTr6; 67c6K£eToa. Letter forms suggest a 3rd Ct BC date (Glaukippos was archon in 275/4 BC). Pottery dates from the 2nd half of the 5th to the end of the 4th Ct. (ADelt 45) Limani Pasha. Seven HL graves were found on the low hill to the S of the little valley where from the 6th Ct BC the Salaminioi from Sounion were settled. (ADelt 44) Megara. In 1989 rescue excavations were conducted at a total of 18 sites in Megara. These produced evidence for cemeteries, mostly extensions of cemeteries already known, with cist and sarcophagus graves of the types normal at Megara. A H-shaped funerary peribolos was found at Odos Argyrokastro and Cheimarras, along with tombs dating from the 4th to the 2nd Ct BC, mostly from 3rd to 2nd. At Odos Xenophontos six cist tombs were LG in date. Other discoveries were remains of buildings, including workshops (R pottery workshops at the 1st Demotic School, Syngrou and at Odos Minoas). Another example of a cellar was found at Odos Dogane, unusual in that it was trapezoidal in plan, only the NW corner forming a right- angle, while the floor sloped to the N. Three square piers supported the roof. It was entered, presumably by a wooden staircase, at the NW corner. In it were found coarse pottery, two EHL lamps and a loomweight. Most of the sherds were HL, with some C. At Odos Nisou a section of the C fortifica- tions of the city were found: the remains of a tower, and for the first time part of the double proteichisma. The tower was rectangular, and had a length of 6.95m. The first proteichisma was 4.40m from the wall, while 6.85m further E was a small part of the outer proteichisma. (ADelt 44) Thirteen excavations in 1990 produced more tombs, includ- ing r- shaped periboloi at Odos Spartis and Odos 28 Octobr- iou. At this cemetery 34 graves were found, ranging from 6th and 5th Ct BC to HL. A single cist grave at Odos N. Xekouki was G in date. A beehive-shaped cistern at Odos Eleutheriou Venizelou contained nothing, having been cleared, it was reported, during the Occupation to serve as a shelter. At Odos N. Xekouki another Megarian cellar was found, measuring 3.03 x 2.88m. The entrance must have been at the NE corner. The preserved height is 2.70m and the roof was supported by a column and a pier. A Doric capital found in the excavation probably belongs to the column. West Slope pottery and other finds date the cistern to E to M HL. At Odos Byzantion foundations of two parallel walls were found. The nearby stream, the stratigraphy and the form of the walls suggest that they belong to a bridge, which would be earlier than three adjacent HL tombs. (ADelt 45) Nea Palatia Oropou. At Odos Bas. Konstantinou, 12 disturbed graves were found, two of them containing late R lamps and glass. (ADelt 45) Palaios Oropos. On two building plots remains of Myc structures were found. At that of Pan. Boutsa the pottery was LH IIIB2, while the walls were built into levels containing MH (grey Minyan) and LH I sherds. At the A. Lechouriti plot, pottery was developed LH IIIB. (ADelt 45) Piraeus. ADelt 44 gives preliminary details of the excavation of Philo's Arsenal, rightly described as the most significant archaeological discovery in Piraeus since systematic excava- tions began. It was found in rescue excavations in Odos II Merarchias in advance of the construction of an underground car park. These revealed the foundations of two walls with two rows of massive piers between. Further excavations at Odos Ypsilantou 170, 83m to the N, uncovered the entrance at the N end, whose details, corresponding to the specification given in IG II2 1668 confirmed that the building was indeed the Arsenal. The wall foundations are 2m wide; the only traces of the stylobate of the piers are the laying-out marks on the bases. The foundations were designed to take account of the slope of the land. Based on their measurements, the building was 18m wide and 131m long. Internal piers were spaced at an axial distance of 3.50m, demonstrating that the foot unit employed was the long (alias Doric or Pheidonian) foot of .3275m. The only superstructure find was the corner of a triglyph, an element of the building not defined in the specification. Knowledge of the precise location of the Arsenal has important significance for the further elucidation of the topography of Piraeus, particularly the agora known as the Hippodameion. Odos Praxitelous 108. Remains of a house with colonnaded courtyard are reported, with three phases from HL to R. It was probably used as a workshop immediately before its abandon-</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 ment and destruction by fire. (ADelt 44) Odos Neosoikon 130-4. The discovery in a natural hollow of the rock of 200 HL lamps (end of 4th Ct BC) is associated with some nocturnal cult. The nozzles of many of the lamps were gilded. (ADelt 44) Odos Botsari 14. One of the wider, central streets of the ancient city was found here. It was 7m wide, between edging walls, and had a central drainage channel. (ADelt 44) At Moschato, at Odos Kyprou and Hydra, the edging of the ancient road and the foundations of a funerary peribolos were found in the area between the S long wall (which runs under Odos Kyprou itself) and the middle wall. The peribolos, and other tombs there, are 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 44) Ramnous. B. Petrakos reports in the Ergon of the AS 1995 that excavations around the N part of the E Gate revealed ashlars of the city-wall, restoring its S part up to the lintel. Stone masonry would have reached the height of 6m, while the rest would have been completed in mudbrick. Numerous small stone missiles within the citadel attest to a siege by unknown enemies. The settlement to the NE of the fortress revealed buildings and inscriptions. The sanctuary of Nemesis was not as dominant as we used to believe. The fortress settlement dates to the first three centuries AD, the last years of its existence, and seems to have been deliberately abandoned. Beneath the scarp of the E road to the gymnasion a metallurgical kiln was discovered. The Rhamnountines pro- cured metal ores from the mines of the adjacent Grammatikon (anc. Eitea) area, (which operated until the Second World War). The craftsman had constructed a makeshift portico, re- using pedestals from votive offerings and stelai as stylobate- slabs. An ancient stairway, the head of a female statue and a naiskos imply that the area was already occupied in the 4th Ct BC. In the shrine of Aphrodite inside the fortress one of the three excavated rooms proved to be a bath: a terracotta tub was found in situ, along with three hearths for a hot water supply. It is a rather humble installation, probably serving the needs of the officers of the local garrison, or the strategos of the coastal region when he visited the fort. The arrangement of the settlement, it would seem, was no different at all from Med walled habitation-areas. Amongst grave-monuments of the 4th BC some pieces from Ramnous are outstanding: the largest grave-relief in Attica (over 3m) belonged to the enclosure of Hierokleus and has been success- fully restored. It was composed of two reliefs intended for separate naiskoi. New fragments have now been restored on the burial relief for the family of Menestides. Other finds include named inscriptions, a votive-column and an inscibed boundary stone. Skala Oropou. At Odos 28 Octobriou ten graves were found, LHL to ER; at Odos Justinian I, remains of walls with pottery, glass and coins of LR date. (ADelt 44) At the junction of Odos 28 Octobriou and M. Alexandrou, a floor of square slabs with amphoras, and LR- ECh pottery, together with eight graves, mostly of children. (ADelt 45) Spata. A N settlement dated to around 4000 BC is reported in the press. Stamata. The resumption of important excavations of an ECh basilica complex on the Mygdaleza site is reported in ADelt 45 (see also AE 1980). Rich finds of 4th Ct AD pottery, along with re-used architectural members, lamps and inscriptions point to the historical importance of the site. The funerary inscriptions were found carved into the walls of a double cist tomb, and surrounded by painted foliate motifs and crosses. Funerary goods found therein included a fine pair of gold earrings, a gold fibula, a silver tooth pick and a 6th Ct AD lekythos. The tomb paintings, rare for Attica, are to be housed in the Byzantine Museum in Athens. Thorikos. B. Petrakos and M. Oikomopoulou report in the Ergon of the AS for 1995 that the large Doric edifice (32.0 x 14.70m) was revealed at euthynteria level on all four sides, in which there are gaps. On the shorter ends, SW and NE, only the euthynteria is preserved in good condition. Most of the steps and columns had been removed either in antiquity or during the 19th Ct. The SE and NW long sides are fully preserved only at the SW half, where a few bottom drums are still in position. In 1995 only half the number of columns were found (8 instead of 16) compared with the number recorded by the Dilettanti expedition in 1812. Alluvial deposits on the krepis suggest that the adjacent river broke through its retain- ing walls during construction of the building, and that therefore it was never completed. Although its overall form is unclear, the existence of doorways indicates that the structure was walled. On the basis of an inscription, the early excavators regarded it a peristyle stoa dedicated to the cult of Demeter and Kore. A layer containing chipped stones dates the erection of the building to the 5th Ct BC. By its NE side remains of makeshift installations, tiles and pot-sherds may be signs of the ancient builders. During the 1st Ct AD, column shafts, capitals and marble ashlars were transferred to the agora of Athens. Voula. Excavations in 1989 and 1990 have revealed much more of the ancient Deme of Halai Aixonidai, including streets, houses and workshops and cemetery areas. It is now clear that the houses were gathered in two settlements, one to the NW, the other to the SE of it. The buildings produced evidence of rural activities, particularly beekeeping. At Odos Solomou 7 a cemetery with funerary periboloi and other graves ranged from mid 5th to mid 2nd Ct BC. One cist grave contained cylindri- cal stone ash-urns, one containing the remains of a diadem, a wooden stem, gilded bronze leaves and myrtle stem and 189 gilded clay myrtle berries. (ADelt 44) At Odos Principou Petrou and Athanasios Diakou, two more Myc chamber tombs were added to the five already known. One contained a child burial in a trench in the dromos. Pottery dates the tombs to LH IIIA2-LH IIIB. (ADelt 44) Sounion. At the 'Tower of the Princess', graves were found during reafforestation work. A peribolos of Agrileza marble included the remains of one or more naiskos monuments, one with an inscription: AMO / ... EOPAI / ... TIMHE / ... This, together with the rural house to the E, probably belonged to Timesios. (ADelt 44) 7</page><page sequence="8">8 R. A. TOMLINSON ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF, etc. (2nd Ephorate and Kythera) Aigina. The Austrian Institute (University of Salzburg) continued work at Kolonna under the direction of Professors F. Felten and S. Hiller, who report: "In 1995 more houses of the PR settlement were excavated in the NW area down to bedrock, revealing undisturbed stratigraphy in several places. Finds belong to MH and EH, with LN in a few small areas. EH levels are EH III, and, for the first time in these excavations, a substantial area of EH II. More occupation horizons in EH III were revealed, of which one was undoubtedly sealed by a disastrous fire. There can be no doubt that this is to be associated with the burnt layer in the vicinity of the town wall, and linked to the end of the 5th city. Extensive areas of MH ceramic deposits were found, though nothing belonging to undisturbed early phases. This demon- strates that the MH material can be associated with the construction of a large stone building, requiring substantial levelling work which destroyed the early MH levels. This relates to the construction of the suburb (Aigina 9). All the more recent levels in the area were removed in levelling in the historic period or in the earlier excavations. Only occasionally, in foundation trenches of HL and LR buildings, were small finds of the intervening periods revealed, including a lamp with the inscription 'Phobos'. Finds included, from EH II: cups, tankards, a jug with incised decoration; from EH III: black and brown burnished as well as glazed vessels, from MH: frag- ments of large vessels and completely preserved, good quality, matt painted and Minyan ware; above all, a Minoanising polychrome grave pithos with a child burial, the sole object from the end of MH. This was covered with a massive stone slab and sunk into the early MH levels." At Leophoros Phaneromeni in 1989 17 graves (robbed) were found. Usage appears to extend from A to R. At Kampos Mylou, there were seven graves of the 5th Ct BC; at Meristos, 38 graves of the early 5th Ct BC and four underground rock- cut ChTs, all with two chambers, of early 5th Ct BC; at Phaneromeni, five graves and one two-chambered rock-cut tomb, early 5th to 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 44) At Kampos Mylou, a two-roomed hypogeum was found, of uncertain purpose, and at Meristos 12 more graves, 6th to 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 45) Kythera. At Palaiopolis a M multi-chambered tomb, of which two chambers and the dromos were cleared in 1990. The rooms were trapezoidal, 1.90 x 1.80m, and 1.95 x 1.70m. Others were left unexcavated. The dromos was 4m long. Finds include two thymiateria, MM IIIB-LM IB and LM I, and an askos LM IA. (ADelt 45) KORINTHIA (4th Ephorate) No report was submitted by the Ephorate for either ADelt 44 or ADelt 45. Corinth. Charles K. Williams reports on the 1995 excavations of the ASCS, of the Frankish remains round temple E: "This year excavation cleared the S facade of unit 1 (AR 1994/95 10), which has proved to be 24m from E to W. Behind this wall is a single hall about 3.80m wide, running the full length of the facade, the longest unpartitioned room in the unit; subdivisions therein are later alterations. The hall pre- serves part of three arches that traversed the space, their footings bonded into the N and S side walls. This room is tentatively identified as the infirmary. Finds from the room were minimal, mainly the result of extensive reoccupation of the space once the building was abandoned, but cumulative archaeological evidence helps in the identification of unit 1 as a hospice or inn that served the sick, poor and pilgrims on their way to and from the Near East. The architecture is solid and serviceable, with the S wall of the room preserved to c. 1.20m above floor level and uninterupted along its entire length by any sort of opening. The wall is founded on the line of a R wall that had earlier defined the N side of a paved decumanus of the R city. We also extended the limit of the Frankish excavation for 3m S of the unit. Two conclusions presented in the 1994 report must be changed because of the new investiga- tions: the main access into unit I is not to be found within the S facade wall, but rather between rooms 3 and 4. Also, the E- W roadway, known to have passed S of the site of the unit during the R and MByz periods and hypothesized to have survived into the 14th Ct was in fact abandoned in the 13th Ct. This Frankish rejection of an established land use is clearly illustrated by the existence of unit 5, a building constructed immediately S of unit 1 that covered the roadway when that unit was built. The SW quarter of unit 1 was used until its total destruction in the 16th Ct. Reuse of the hall is especially clear. The altered W wall of the room rises to a maximum height of .93m above the top of the foundation that originally supported the Frankish building. A stone-walled pit was then constructed against the back or W face of the foundation. This underground chamber, belonging to the second phase of use of the hall was dis- covered this year. The upper fill within the pit is late in date, apparently going into the 18th and 19th Cts, to judge from the iron horseshoes it contained. The bottommost .34m of fill is composed of pure Frankish period material that probably dates around AD 1312, or slightly later. A third period of use for the room can be identified in this area. This is a reconstruction that buried the alteration just described, and also the pit. Its walls reuse neither the already existing walls of unit 1 nor those of its first alteration. The S wall of the new phase is built against the S facade wall of unit 1, its partition walls cross over the facade wall and rest on fill and debris that overlies the occupation level associated with the first alteration. Unit 5, immediately S of unit 1, uses its facade as its N wall. The two units appear to be part of a single design and the product of a single building operation; this is suggested by the line of the E exterior wall of unit 1 which continues without interuption as the E facade of unit 5, but not all of unit 5 is excavated. Against the S facade of unit 1 is a corridor of unit 5; S of the corridor is a room with a tiled floor. Both the corridor and the room have an interior E-W dimension of 4.46m. The floor of the room in unit 5 is neatly tiled; about a third is still preserved. Two distinct chronological phases were distinguished among the components that form unit 2, a monastery. The earlier is represented by the church at the SE corner and the tile-paved rooms to its W, rooms A, B, C, and D. The second phase starts with a very shabby reconstruction of rooms A and B, and possibly also room C. That phase covered the tiled floors; thereafter came the abandonment of rooms A and B with a more substantial Frankish reconstruction of the unit focussed within the area N of the church. This year more evidence was unearthed for both the MByz and Frankish phases of unit 2. In the MByz period a vaulted subterranean chamber stood against the exterior face of the W wall, close to the SW corner of the unit. The chamber appears to have been purposely buried under the Byz roadway W of the unit. Its only access would have</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 been through a very low doorway in the W wall of room A. It has the appearance of a secret room, perhaps for the storage of valuables. When discovered it had been entered after the unit was abandoned and laid open for some time after the monas- tery had been abandoned. The Frankish rebuilding of the unit appears to have been focussed on the area N and immediately NW of the church. The Franks converted room D into an enclosed cemetery. In the MByz monastery the floor of room D was slightly below that of the narthex and church floors. Access from room D to the church was through a well-built door. In the Frankish phase the doorway was altered by raising the threshold. A cranium count indicates that at least 32 individuals were buried here, while unexcavated grave shafts indicate that a minimum of six more individuals lie unexcavated. The ages of the skeletons range from premature infants to young adults between 18 and 20 years old. Among the objects recovered from dry-sieving within the grave shafts were wick holders that are used with glass lamps, perhaps themselves used as lights over the graves. The most extensive remains of the Frankish monastery lie immediately N of the church. A 2m-wide corridor extends over 7m towards the N where it now disappears into unexcavated fill. It is entered from the narthex of the church. It has two distinct occupation levels; the lower floor at the height of the marble paving within the narthex, the upper preserved at 30cm above the original floor. Four intact graves were unearthed within the corridor, three buried under the original floor, one buried from the upper level. A second corridor, laid out adjacent to the first, like it now disappears into unexcavated earth at the N. There are no indications that it was used for burials, but rather for storage, with shelves along its walls. Room 8 of the monastery was excavated, and its compan- ion, room 9, except for its northernmost two and a half metres. These rooms are not rectangular because their N wall does not run at right angles to the side walls. Room 8 is 8.60m long along its W wall; room 9 6.80m along its E wall. The first corridor may be identified as a cloister-like passage because of the burials. The second had a more domestic function with storage for glass cups and lamps. Rooms 8 and 9, E of the corridors, also had a domestic storage function. Both a matt- painted local storage container with three handles and a heavy- walled matt-painted amphora were found here, with a number of coarse and glazed pitchers and bowls, a cooking pot and other cooking ware sherds. The absence of animal bones in the debris suggests that the rooms were not dedicated to the preparation of food or eating. Dr Guy Sanders supervised the excavation of a R bath that had been in large part cleared by the Greek Archaeological Service a number of years ago. It lies SE of the E end of the S Stoa, about 300m outside the main excavation area. The complex consists of a complete small bathing unit of furnace, caldarium, tepidarium, frigidarium and apodyterion. No connecting remains are preserved around it, nor is it adjacent to any R city street. It probably belonged to a large villa, all but the slightest traces of which have been ploughed away. The furnace faces W and the apodyterion is on the N side of the complex. The bath lies just under plough soil, and its walls are preserved generally to a height of no more than 30cm above the original floor level. All rooms are easily traceable because they preserve most of their original concrete, tile and rubble foundations and much of the marble veneer floor covering. The frigidarium has a marble pattern of diamonds and panels preserved on its floor. The tepidarium has its floor almost totally destroyed but a large part of the hypocaust is in fairly good condition. The floor of the caldarium is preserved and the veneered side walls of its pools are largely intact. Destruction debris associated with the bath indicate that the final abandon- ment of the complex should be placed in the late 6th or 7th Ct AD. Almost all the material recovered is coarse ware, mainly amphoras and utility vessels; some LR table wares, especially African red and LR C fabrics, were found among the coarse wares. The construction date is still in question as no examin- ation has yet been made of the early undisturbed fills around the complex nor as yet has any of the construction fill been tested." A cemetery complex dating from the 2nd Ct AD up to the ECh period was located outside the walls of anc. Corinth in 1988. The core of the complex consists of three underground burial chambers arranged in parallel sequence, orientated E-W. Other burials radiate from these in all directions. The middle of the three central tombs is carved into the rock and includes a smaller cruciform feature in the centre, likewise carved into the rock. Traces of painted vine and grape decoration exist, along with a fragmentary inscription. The tomb complex indicates social differentiation in the burials as regards location of burial and funerary goods, which included many unguentaria made of both clay and glass, as well as lamps, of which LR (pagan) and ECh examples were found with Corinthian and Attic workshop stamps on the bases. Plainware pottery and bronze nails (apotropaic use?) were also found. (ADelt 45) Isthmia. Timothy E. Gregory reports on the Ohio State University excavations: "A primary concern in 1995 was the R bath to the N of the Temple of Poseidon. The full architectural documentation of this building was virtually completed, including a total of eleven sections through the bath which, along with plan and detail drawings, will form the basis for the final publication. Further study has raised the question of whether the extant remains might not represent two major construction phases, both probably in the 2nd Ct AD. Conservation of the large monochrome mosaic in the bath, begun in 1990, reached an important stage this year, as all the panels raised in 1980 and 1990-a total of 148-have now been relaid successfully. An extensive program of object conservation was carried out. This involved the examination and conservation of all metal objects and coins, and the complete rehousing of the miscellaneous small finds in proper archival quality containers. A major program was begun to rehouse the glass, stone and organic material now stored with context pottery, in order better to protect it from long-term deterioration. Finally, a conservation database was set up to record and allow access to information about conservation treatment of all objects. Further study was conducted this year in the so-called E field, in the area between the Temenos of Poseidon and the Byz fortress. Considerable progress was made this year in the identification of specific architectural complexes, indicating that several spaces once thought to represent separate buildings were in fact rooms in larger complexes. It is now possible to suggest that the central part of the area was originally domi- nated by two rather large complexes, with a courtyard or open space between them. At a later date the ground level was raised considerably, several other structures were built, and the existing structures apparently subdivided." Elizabeth R. Gebhard reports on the University of Chicago excavations: "Preliminary statistical studies regarding the volume of pottery and the quantity of imports lend support to the tradi- tional date of 582/580 BC assigned to the beginning of the 9</page><page sequence="10">10 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 1 Panhellenic Isthmian Games. After a hiatus during most of the 7th Ct, ceramic imports resume ca 588-575 BC and the overall volume of pottery increases dramatically. The same rise is seen in the arms and armour, other metal vessels and the terracotta figurines. The first terracotta perirrhanteria, and evidence for buildings in addition to the Temple of Poseidon, appear at about the same time. A major project was the conservation and restoration of arms and armour. Three very fragmentary and badly damaged helmets were repaired and, together with a fourth helmet mended last year, were arranged for display in the Isthmia museum. A figured shield-strap of the 6th Ct BC, exactly paralleled by an example from Olympia, was cleaned and remounted. The armour was assigned to 64 groups, with one third falling in the 7th to early 6th Ct and the other two thirds in the period between c. 550 and the early 5th Ct BC. A provisional estimate shows that well over 33 hoplite shields belong to the latter period. Since most of the bronze armour and shields is represented by small fragments, all inventoried and uninventoried pieces were weighed. A R pilum head found in the Rachi settlement lends support to the hypothesis, based on deposits of building debris and pottery, that the sanctuary was attacked by the Romans c. 200 BC. The presence of a wooden ceiling over the peristyle of the A Temple of Poseidon is indicated by cuttings for a lattice work of supporting planks. Every fourth plank was also connected to a wooden pilaster standing against the cella wall. At a higher level on the cella walls geison shaped blocks received the sloping rafters for the roof, and, on the inside, horizontal beams for the ceiling of the cella. Two sets of blocks and painted roof tiles were identified as the N and E gates of the HL temenos. On the basis of the decorated tiles the larger structure, the N gate, is dated c. 325 BC. Roof tiles assigned to the second group, probably coming from the E gate, give a construction date in the early 3rd Ct BC. Three-dimensional analysis of objects from the destruction of the Rachi settlement c. 200 BC yielded information on the contents of the basements, the rooms above, and the adjacent courtyards at the time of destruction. Study of 300 loom- weights from the Rachi, with 150 from the sanctuary, many stamped and/or incised with gem seals and finger-rings or a stylus, showed that they were made by using a conical mould for the upper part and forming the lower part and base by hand. New stamp types include a male head in profile, Macedonian star, Nike crowning an armed warrior, a flaming torch, a bull's head festooned for sacrifice and a serpent approaching a small child. Examination of faunal remains revealed that the unburnt bones, of sheep and goats, seem to come largely from the legs, while the burnt bones may well come from hind quarters, thus supporting the traditional view of Greek sacrifice. Some</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 deposits of unburnt bones as well as masses of burnt bone near the long altar, suggest that dining as well as sacrifice took place in the area." Nemea. Stephen G. Miller reports: "Work at Nemea in 1995 was devoted to the study of previously excavated material, and to the repair of the stadium entrance tunnel and its preparation for use in the new Nemean Games on June 1, 1996. The repair work consisted of replacing the keystone of the vault (which had fallen at some point later than the 6th Ct AD) with a concrete mixture formulated to imitate the chemical composition and the texture of the sandy limestone of the original construction. With the repair com- pleted, it was possible to remove the moder braces we had installed in 1978, and to remove the remainder of the silted fill beneath the area of the collapse. That work uncovered a battered fragment of an Ionic capital of a size previously unknown at Nemea, but no other discoveries of significance were forthcoming. The result is that the entrance tunnel is now completely clear and can be safely traversed by visitors." ARGOLIS (4th Ephorate) No report was submitted to ADelt 44 Chr or ADelt 45 Chr. Epidauros. B. Lambrinoudakis reports in the Ergon of the AS for 1995 that the conservation of monuments in the Sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas was continued at the skana of the R building and at the Nymphaion. The valley S to the Temenos of the Muses and its LC conduit were investigated. Despite the disturbance of the deposits by a lime kiln, it was confirmed that the large LC drain had originally taken the water from the valley. The deposits behind the R peribolos contained offerings from the ash altar of the sanctuary. Progress was made with the reconstruction on paper of the R propylon to the sanctuary. Midea. G. Walberg (Swedish Institute) reports the excavations on the lower terraces: "A large building of megaron type, measuring 14 x 7.50m was excavated on one of the lower terraces (Fig. 1). It was constructed in LH IIIB. While LH IIIB pottery was still in use, repairs were undertaken and a new floor laid down. The remains of a LH IIIB hearth, disturbed by a R pit, were flanked by two roof support bases, and two more dislocated bases were found on this second floor. A third, LH IIIC, floor was laid down after earthquake destruction and reinforced by additional walls. The LH IIIC interior plan has no hearth, but a central row of roof support bases divides the main room. This new plan is similar to that of the LH IIIC Megaron W at Tiryns. A niche constructed in LH IIIC contained three large sword pommels (of ivory, alabaster and lapis lacedaemonicus) and a necklace of faience beads. To the W of the building a step, continuing the staircase excavated in 1991, and a platform were found. Excavations immediately to the W of the megaron revealed that it was part of a larger complex which continued beyond the platform and entrance to the megaron. The excavated portion of the complex now measures more than 20m. The SE corner of the megaron rested on a MH tomb cut out of the rock. A large stone block had been placed under this corner and the tomb emptied and then filled with rocks. Along the S wall of the megaron an earlier wall of large blocks had been cut by the megaron wall. This may belong to a predecessor of the LH IIIB megaron, and would have been contemporary with the early tombs at Dendra. The S wall of the LH IIIB megaron was provided with five butresses built against the hillside at regular intervals, similar to those found at the megaron- complex of the Menelaion." Troizen. The press reported the discovery at Magoula in 1995 of a tholos tomb of 1600 BC. ARKADIA (5th Ephorate) No report was submitted to ADelt 44 Chr or ADelt 45 Chr. Eva. Dr Th. Spyropoulos has given public lectures on, and the press have widely reported, the exciting results of his excava- tions in 1995 at the villa of Herodes Atticus, which he com- pares with Hadrian's villa at Tivoli. Only part of the structure has been uncovered so far, but this has produced sculpture of outstanding quality, in Pergamene style (Menelaos and Patrok- los, Niobids, Satyr and Dionysos etc.) and a series of mosaics, including the Royal Hunt of Dido and Aeneas (Fig. 2). Lusoi. Veronika Mitsopoulou-Leon reports on the work of the Austrian Institute: "In 1995 excavations were resumed in the area of the Temple of Artemis, concentrating on the foundation trenches in the E part of the temple. The aim was to find further evidence for the architecture and chronology of the building. Blocks no longer in situ were cleared from the interior. Among marble Doric half- and full column blocks, limestone blocks were identified for the first time; these belonged to the lower part of the cella wall, giving a height of 1.30-1.40m. In the E part of the temple the remaining walls of the church built above it were largely removed. This made it possible to clear down to bedrock and to investigate the euthynteria and foundations of the temple, hitherto built over. Also freed was the preserved section of the pronaos/cella wall. Numerous fragments of worked building stone which came from the temple were removed from the wall material of the church, including fragments of columns and capitals (half columns and pilaster capitals) in marble, and poros fragments of half- columns as well as fragments of limestone. The foundation trenches in the E area of the temple were linked to those in the W. As well as debris from stone worling and cutting of trenches, fragments of pottery, small bronze rings and coils and tesserae from a mosaic floor were found at the level of the euthynteria. In the removal of earth N of the N wall, besides ancient material, a 19th Ct coin (George I, 1896) was found, linked to the building of the church. E of the temple the so- called 'altar' was investigated. As it consisted of fragments from the destroyed temple, all thought of an altar foundation should be abandoned. In the earth over and around the bothros, offerings were found mixed with later material: fragments of a female protome, a flat figurine and a Peloponnesian bronze fibula of the 7th Ct. For the first time two miniature bone axes were found, as well as fragments of two fibulae of the same material. A bronze signet ring of C date was found E of the S aisle, engraved on an oval ground with a a female figure (Penelope, Electra?) sitting on an amphora." Megalopolis. Ulla Kreilinger reports that the joint German- Greek excavations uncovered more of the Stoa of Philip. More architectural elements were found, and a herm inside the stoa. A reused triglyph block from the agora bore an inscription for Septimius Severus. 11</page><page sequence="12">12 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 2 Tegea. Erik 0stby reports on the work of the Norwegian Institutes at the sanctuary of Athena Alea: "The 1995 season was principally devoted to the study of the material from the excavations in the temple area. The material from the two successive cult buildings of LG date turns out to be difficult to distinguish by stratigraphical or stylistic analysis, and the two buildings must consequently have followed each other within a limited time span in the late 8th and early 7th Cts BC. Some joining of sherds was achieved, most interestingly two sherds from a MPCor aryballos with a figure scene, probably mythological. Among the sherd material from earlier periods, some undecorated Myc ware and smaller quantities of MH and EH fabrics could be identified. Much work was devoted to the material from the votive pit in front of the cult buildings where large quantities of PG and early G pottery of 'Laconian Dark Age' type was recovered during the last season; some almost complete pots could be assembled from these sherds. Study of the building material from the C temple has lead to a slight revision of the previous reconstruc- tion of the column height, and to new observations concerning the curvature of the epistyle." Phigaleia. At Kato Vrysi the sanctuary of a female deity was excavated, dating between the end-6th to early-4th Ct BC, and incorporating a cave. Finds included 150 lamps and the fragments of hundreds more, dating from the 2nd half-5th Ct to early-4th Ct, which are indicators of a night-time ritual. One bronze and many clay plaques were found, with representations of a female. Other finds include lead dedicatory crowns and the bones of piglets. (ADelt 44) The press reported the excavation in 1995 of a temple of Athena, identified by an inscription on a statue base. The temple included the base for the cult statue. LAKONIA (6th Ephorate) No report was submitted to ADelt 44 Chr or ADelt 45 Chr. Laconia rural sites project. W.G. Cavanagh and C.B. Mee report: "The study season this year had three main aims: firstly to carry out resistivity survey at a time of year when the soil would be saturated from the winter rains, secondly to carry out further soil sampling and other tests on the soil, and thirdly to study the pottery and other artefacts in detail. All three aims were carried through successfully and the results were as follows: Resistivity. Five sites-LP 1, 4, 5, 13, and 18-were selected for resistivity survey using the geoscan RM 15 resistance meter. The sites surveyed had been shown in previous years to contain magnetic anomalies, but dry soil conditions had hampered electrical investigation at the time of their discovery. No new</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 features were detected by the new survey, although it did provide better definition of some of the magnetic anomalies. Soils. The study season allowed the collection of additional samples for analyses designed to investigate the distribution of trace element concentrations amongst various determined chemical forms (exchangeable, Mn-oxide bound). Variations in critical soil properties such as pH, organic matter, calcium carbonate, particle-size, clay mineralogy and structure may have a major influence in the propagation of micro-elements amongst the diverse chemical forms, and as such will be examined. The potential of field measurement of magnetic susceptibility was tested using a Bartington MS2 meter and probe, measuring in transects every 2.5m at the ground surface and every 5m at 20cm depth. In 1994, high summer tempera- tures had adversely affected the meter. Data for the 20cm measurements will be compared with the results obtained in the laboratory for samples collected in 1993. Pottery. In studying the pottery over 6000 sherds were examined for dating and evidence of site function. Prior experience in handling the material from the Laconia survey proved helpful in refining the chronology and typology of the vessels. The sites can now be more precisely dated: LP 7-EH II (earlier phase); LP 8-EH II (earlier and later phases); LP 10- MH-LH IIIB; LP 20-LH IIIA-B; LP 18-A/C; LP 19-LA/C; LP 11-C; LP 14-C; LP 5-C-HL; LP 17-C-HL; LP 3-HL; LP 15- HL; LP 2-LHL-R; LP 4-LHL-R; LP 13-R; LP l-R-LR; LP 6- LR; LP 12-LR; LP 9-MByz; LP 16-M/LByz-Ott." Geraki. In the summer of 1995 a new Dutch fieldwork project began at the acropolis of Geraki (anc. Geronthrai) in central-E Lakonia. These investigations, carried out by the Department of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Amsterdam, follow on earlier and limited research at the beginning of this century; they report: "Geraki is situated 26km SE of Sparta, in the foothills of the Parnon mountains. The village is built against and around an imposing acropolis hill with a distant but clear view of the sea. It dominates the large fertile plain that slopes down to the valley of the Eurotas to the W, and is strategically located on the route which leads from central Lakonia through Parnon to the E coast of the Peloponnese. The primary aim of the investigations is to establish the full chronological range of human occupation on the acropolis and adjoining slopes, specifying size and function of the site in any given period and documenting possible shifts of location. The 1995 season was dedicated to drawing up a detailed topo- graphical map, to the planning and study of standing remains-in particular the large acropolis wall-and the system- atic collection of artefacts present at the surface of the acrop- olis and adjacent slopes, with the help of modern geodetical and other computer-aided techniques. Preliminary study of the acropolis wall led to the distinction of at least six different types of construction, whose date and function await further study. The archaeological survey made substantial progress with the collection of surface material and with its subsequent processing. This work is to be completed during a second campaign planned for the spring of 1996. In date, the surface finds range from PR to recent times, with the majority belonging to the C and HL periods. Earliest are EH pottery and chipped stone finds, mostly obsidian; the pottery includes types firmly dated to EH II. While the MH period is represented by pottery of different fabrics, finds of firm Myc date are so far notably absent. This casts doubt on dating the acropolis wall to this period. After a long gap, activity is again attested by a handful of painted sherds classed as G. The A period is well represented, some of the pottery being clearly votive in character. Votive pots continue to appear among the numerous finds of the C and HL periods. Among later material, mainstream R red slip, MByz painted or sgraffito wares and LByz fine glazed wares are rare." Monemvasia. The survey of the upper city of Monemvasia was continued by a team from the University of Manchester led by Dr D. Hill. The survey is designed to assist the long- term research on the city by Dr H. Kalligas and is under her overall direction. They report: "The major work has been the extension of the detailed survey within our main research area inside the uper city. The full length of the southern walls has been photographed, and they have been planned from the gatehouse to the furthermost western turret. The measured survey of the area behind these walls has also continued. The detailed recording of the entire castro at a scale of 1:50 is a mammoth task, and we have therefore concentrated on the area marked out by the length of walls described above, the Galeazza cistern and the Bastada cistern. This quadrilateral encompasses a dry valley running from north to south and makes a sensible unit. The photographic record of the city walls is complete except for a closely detailed record of the Mura Rossa, an enormous wall built between two turrets, which was built by the Turks, possibly in 1564, to block off the original northern entrance to the citadel. Traces of the earlier walls and paths of this route to the top can be seen, but much was destroyed when the wall was built and the 600ft cliff today appears sheer from sea to citadel. This entrance complex and its blocking wall were examined from the sea and, with the assistance of one of our team who is an experienced climber, Dr Kalligas was able to examine the area at close quarters for the first time. Derek Seddon, our photographer, also examined the complex and is attempting to devise a new photographic system for the 1996 season to overcome the technical and physical problem. The recording of the rainwater storage cisterns continued with the Bastada, to add to the surveys of the Galera and Galeazza completed in previous years. The cistern is a com- plex, partially rock-cut structure, of which there are only low walls some 10m square visible on the surface today. The surface thorn bushes had to be cleared so that access could be gained through one of the two small openings on the top. The water level is 4m below and entrance is made by ladder. A considerable time was spent in setting up scaffolding in the interior so that it could be recorded without disturbing the water and the silts beneath it-the light is bad, the air can be fouled if the silts are disturbed; slugs are a visible menace. The interior consists of two parallel chambers divided by three arches on two pillars. The barrel-vaulted roof is clearly multi- period and requires a more detailed architectural analysis." Sparta, theatre. A five week season of excavation and study was carried out by a team under the direction of Professors Waywell and Wilkes, who report: "Research concentrated on renewed investigation of the remains of the stage-building excavated by Woodward in 1924- 28. Other work included: excavation of the well in the N part of the orchestra, which proved to be of Med date, with minimal finds; extraction of mortar samples for analysis by the Fitch laboratory; continued study of environmental material from the 1989-91 R stoa and 1992-94 theatre excavations for publication. Stage-building: three new trenches in the W stage-building examined the foundations of the existing walls. It was found 13</page><page sequence="14">14 R. A. TOMLINSON that the footings went down to a depth of 1.80m, cut into the natural sandy gravel, and that they consisted of broken Doric architectural elements, mostly marble column drums, capitals and cornices, derived from an earlier, large-scale stage struc- ture. Identifiable fragments were drawn to scale, and a prelimi- nary reconstruction of the Doric order was achieved. Examin- ation of the lines of poros blocks from an earlier stage-structure excavated by Woodward tends to rehabilitate the theory of Bulle (1937) that the original stage was a moveable structure that rolled out of the scenery store in the W parados, arguably to be accommodated in front of a Doric marble structure, the fragments of which were later used in the second-phase foundations. Detailed planning was carried out on the stage- building, with particular attention paid to the platforms for projecting porche which belong to phase 2. Many architectural elements of Corinthian and Composite orders, mostly found by Woodward and still on site, were also drawn to scale. These belonged to the scaenae frons of the second phase stage-building, which may be dated to AD 78-9 if, as is likely, the architrave inscribed with the name of Vespasian as donor originally spanned the central doorway. Nearly one hundred blocks from the facade were drawn, including plinths, bases, monolithic column shafts, capitals, architraves and frieze blocks of two different scales, and two types of cornices. Preliminary attempts at reconstruction suggest a two storey facade with 16 columns on each level, including the pairs which flanked the triple entrances. Capitals are likely to have been Corinthian on the lower level and Pergamene on the upper storey, except for the central doorway and porch which was probably more ornately treated with composite capitals on granite shafts. The upper storey may have been redesigned at a later date. The evidence available suggests three main phases of construction for the stage-building. The first, which must date to the original time of construction under Eurykles (ca 30-20 BC) was in the late HL tradition with a combination of moving and fixed structures utilizing the Doric order. The second phase completed in AD 78-79, which mostly survives, was R in design and decoration, and provides a visible testimony to the Romanisation of Sparta's institutions in the Flavian period following the fall of the Euryclid dynasty. The third phase, perhaps dating to the Severan period in the early 3rd Ct AD, involved strengthening the stage-building with butresses, and extending the stage out into the orchestra. The upper storey may have been redesigned at this time. Subsequent repairs to the structure are recorded by the inscribed friezes and cornices now displayed in the orchestra, but no further main phases are detectable until the incorporation of the stage-building into the LR fortifications around AD 400, and the spoliation of the scaenae frons." ACHAIA (6th Ephorate) Agios Konstantinos. Three ChTs were found, one circular, one rectangular, one oval, part of a cemetery of Myc ChTs. Dates are LH IIIA-C. (ADelt 45) Aigeira. The work of the Austrian Institute continued in 1995 under the direction of Dr A. Bammer, who reports: "In the Palaiologos area, further investigations were conducted at the vaulted mortared rubble structure. The remaining plan of the complex was traced through the thick grass cover, comprising a sequence of small linked rooms, indicative of a Byz monastery. At the cult buildings of the Sanctuary of Zeus at Palaiokas- tro, the W extremities of the peripteros and the in antis buildings were found, deeply buried. The cross wall of the opisthodomos of the peripteros was excavated, and found to have a height of m. Only the foundation trench of the S anta was preserved. Foundations of inner colonnades were found, dividing the cella in three. The peripteros had 6 x 11 columns and measured ca 12 x 21 m. Three early C Doric capitals were built into the cella wall. In the E entrance of the in antis temple, the fine limestone foundation uncovered in 1994 was found to have anathyrosis jointing, and to belong to the remains of an earlier building, similar in width to the HL building (which measures ca 10 x 19m), but of uncertain length. Presumably the reused Doric capitals belonged to this building, along with the painted terracotta sima fragment found in 1994, dating it to the early 5th Ct." Aigion. Abundant finds are reported from Odos Plastira 7, indicating the use of the site as a settlement in EH, MH, LH, CL, HL, R, Byz and Ott times. MH and LH levels indicate destruction by fire. There is a MH cemetery, and LG pithos burials, as well as Frankish graves. It is suspected, from the discovery of dedicatory plaques, that there was a temple in the area immediately to the N of the excavated plot. (ADelt 45) Amygdalia. Excavations continued of eight Myc ChTs from the cemetery of an unidentified Myc settlement. The confirmed dating is LH IIIA to LH IIIC. (ADelt 44) Ano Mazaraki. Excavation of the LG apsidal temple con- tinued. A wall was found in front of the apse with a door, with traces of carbonized wood either from the door or the roof. On the N side stone bases for the wooden columns of the pteron were uncovered. The temple, destroyed in the 4th Ct BC, was probably 31m long, making it a hekatompedon. (ADelt 44) Chalandritsa Patron. Following tomb robbery, rescue excavations were carried out at the known Myc cemetery, revealing ChTs with rectangular chambers. Abundant grave goods indicated a date of LH IIIB-C. In the vicinity of the cemetery were hundreds of Pal tools, and HL and R sherds and tiles. Further work is planned. (ADelt 44) Dyme: Kato Achaia. ECh burials were encountered, probably associated with a basilica that once occupied the site of the present church of the Theotokos. This is the first indication of Ch occupation of this particular area. No finds were reported. (ADelt 45) Elaiochori. A cemetery of PR ChTs is reported in the press, dated to EH. Kleitor. Excavation continued at the SW gate, and at the site of the ancient theatre, where a significant number of architec- tural elements was found. (ADelt 44) Krini Patron.

These comprised its W side and adjacent rooms with superimposed levels of habita-</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 15 tion. The remains belong to a rectangular building orientated NW-SE and measuring about 15 x 10m. The preserved walls are .65m thick and 2m high with their foundations, constructed in a R style with successive layers of unworked stone, baked brick and mortar. Part only of the interior was excavated, revealing a thick destruction layer of fallen roof tiles and fragments of large pithoi. The thickness of the walls. the careful construction and the size of the structure all indicate that it must have been an important building. A partition wall indicates the existence of one or more rooms in the area W of the building. Excavation reached a depth of 3.9m. The erection of the main building was followed by a long period of habita- tion. represented by five successive floors. one of which showed traces of a hearth. while another, at a higher level, preserved a basin with its interior surface plastered. The discovery of eight bronze coins, dating from Aurelian (270-275 AD) to the 4th and perhaps 5th Ct AD provides a terminus anIte quem for the building. Among the finds, in addition to large quantities of pottery, are fragments from glass vases, objects of bone. fragments of marble decoration in opus sectile, and organic remains of food: animal bones, snails, sea shells and seeds. The building was clearly destroyed by a violent earthquake. It can now be seen that these remains are part of an extensive settlement occupying the district between Nikolai- ika and modern Eliki. This conclusion is important in relation to the major topographical problem of the location of C Helike and its R successor, mentioned by Pausanias (vii 24.5). Especially significant is a group of potsherds found in the deeper excavation layers which have no relation to the R horizon, since they date to the Myc and C periods. This supports our suggestions that earlier occupation horizons exist in deeper levels in this area." Patras. Rescue excavations were carried out by the Ephorate in 1989 and 1990. Most of these were of course restricted in their extent by the area of the plots of land investigated prior to redevelopment, and no completely excavated buildings are reported. Nevertheless the overall consequence is the building up of a wider understanding of the ancient city and its archae- ology. Particularly significant were excavations at different parts of the modern Odos Erenstrole, which revealed well-built houses (HL succeeded by R) lining laid-out streets, cobbled and with vaulted drains set underneath their succession of road surfaces. (ADelt 44) Occupation usually continues into Byz, and their are reports of PByz in several areas. At Odos Psilanonion occupation extended from A to ECh, with buildings, shrines and ancillary structures, dating from C. (ADelt 45) In both 1989 and 1990, more tombs were excavated belonging to the already known N and S cemeteries of the city. Among the finds from various parts of Achaia transferred to the Patras museum, most notable is part of a marble milestone, from the church of St Pandeleimon at Vrachneika with an inscription: IMP.P(OPLIUS)(---) / VALERIAN(US) / ET C(--. Petroto. In constructing a farm road a tholos tomb was partly destroyed. Scattered bones and offerings were found on the original floor, and in the fill above this, some 30-40 skeletons. It was in use from LH II onwards. (ADelt 44) Portes Achaias. The press reported the discovery of a Myc ChT, with the skeleton of a warrior in his armour: helmet, spearhead, dagger, sword and greaves; the helmet still pre- serves part of its inner lining. Spaliareika Lousikon. The excavation of a cemetery of Myc ChTs is reported in ADelt 45 (a preliminary note also in ADelt 44). Most significant is tomb 2, unrobbed, with grave goods of LH IIIB-C date. There is a second cemetery some 500m to the N. Vouteni. Two more ChTs (17 and 20) of the known Myc cemetery were excavated. (ADelt 45) AITOLIA-AKARNANIA (6th Ephorate) Ampelaki (Amphilochian Argos). Part of a large building is reported, probably a house, LHL in date, the remains of painted plaster were found under a destruction level. (ADelt 44) Messolonghi. At Agios Thomas graves were found, including a funerary peribolos with built burial chambers covered with a flat slab roof. Finds include coins of the Aitolian League (279- 168 BC) and Sikyon (250-146 BC). (ADelt 44) Moschovi Loutrakiou Katounas. The discovery of an EH tomb and a small tholos (diam. 2.40m) dated to LH IIIA is reported. (ADelt 45) Naupaktos. At Odos Apokaukou a section of the city wall, with two courses of trapezoidal masonry preserved, was found in 1989. S of this were the remains of a HL house. In the 1st and 2nd Cts AD the area became a cemetery. To the SE is a LR house. (ADelt 44) More remains of the ECh five-aisled basilica came to light in Andreopoulou. LR building remains are reported on Tze- bella, where a perforated LR marble closure panel, architectural members (spiral fluted column) but also much Byz glazed and incised pottery were found. (ADelt 45) Nea Pleurona. Rescue excavation after tomb robbing revealed a peribolos containing two separate built chambers with flat slab roofs, one 2.03 x 1.24 x 1.56m high, with a kline filled with earth and stone, the second also with a kline. The entrance was blocked with slabs. Finds are HL. There were pyres on the outside of the peribolos and the fragment of an inscribed stele: ]PTEMIAQPE XAIPE. (ADelt 44) Rouga Paliampelon. The remains of a HL and R settlement were excavated after illegal digging. Finds included an inscription recording a Senatus Consultum of the Ist Ct AD (text not given). (ADelt 45) Stratos. Trial excavations were carried out in 1990 in the agora, where stratigraphy was found ranging from C to Byz, and in the theatre, where part of the orchestra and the E analemma were uncovered. The upper part of the cavea is largely destroyed. (ADelt 45) Thermon. I.D. Papapostolou reports on the work of the AS for 1995: "The stratigraphy beneath the slabs of the elliptical peristasis in megaron B-thought to be the precursor of peripteral temples-was systematically investigated. The 5th and 6th slabs (from the S) rest in the upper 'dark' stratum which extends upon a horizon of hard clay, to which the slabs are apparently related. Below comes a stratum of reddish soil with charred carbonized remains of a destruction level. Deeper down we encounter clear yellow soil with the holes left by the burning</page><page sequence="16">16 R. A. TOMLINSON of wooden posts. An identical stratigraphic sequence has been verified in the rear room of megaron B. The reddish layer covers the ruins of the room; so it postdates its destruction and belongs to a successor of the megaron, represented by the post- holes in the yellow stratum. The slabs of the elliptical peristasis superimposed on the destruction level must have been laid after megaron B and its successor-edifice had disappeared. A layer of burnt clay intermingled with white ash, at a depth of .80- .70m on the E of the front and the main room is the hearth with sacrificial ash of Rhomaios; it is in a bad state of preser- vation. As far as we can tell, it postdates the period of use for megaron B, as it covers part of its transverse partition wall. A strip of land to the N of the E wall of megaron B illuminates the stratigraphic sequence. Cutting through the deposits that buried megaron B were trenches filled with ash and iron weapons, betraying continuous use and corresponding to the hearth of white sacrificial ash. Following the levelling off of this space comes the erection of the temple. Interesting conclusions can be reached even at this early stage of research: megaron B was erected between the LH IIIC and the EIA. Because of its shape and size it claims the most important rank in a settlement, which demonstrates fresh occupation on this site. Ceramic evidence denotes that after its destruction in 1200 BC, Myc influence was drastically reduced. Thermon was then culturally orientated toward the S Balkans, Epirus and W Macedonia. Isolation from S and E Greece lasted until the 8th BC. Explicit proof of cult in Thermon can be obtained only from megaron B so far. After its demise no total occupation of the site occurred. At its northernmost part a wooden-framed and clay-daubed structure was put up, perhaps reinforced by wooden posts. Radio carbon dating puts the wood's age in the last third of the 9th Ct BC, giving us a terminus post qulem for construction. The E section received a clay hearth for burnt sacrifices, while the plot to the S of the megaron was taken up by a repository (bothros), where small shafts retained ash and votive iron armour. To the penultimate phase (before the erection of the temple) belong cult traces (such as a standing slab) and the formation of slabs previously regarded as column bases for the elliptical peristasis. Although they can be certainly dissociated from megaron B, their function remains a mystery." KEPHALLENIA (6th Ephorate) Ithake. S. Symeonoglou reports in the Ergon of the AS for 1995: "On the site Aetos the foundation of a wall (15m long) built of large stones was found. The fill, covering the almost collapsed foundation, contained many C sherds, of which the quality and character indicate that they were dedications in a sanctuary. The stratigraphic sequence inside the building is constantly interrupted. A large fragment of a decorated Myc krater and numerous G sherds were found; also early 4th Ct BC vessels, shattered figurines, lamps and coins. The building was obviously destroyed during the earthquake of 374 BC, which devastated W Greece. In the middle of the building-at foundation level-is an enormous irregularly-shaped opening (Sm deep) terminating in a circular chamber hewn in the soft rock; S of this is a rectangular pedestal (4.10 x 1.60m) and a built well (1.25m in diameter). It is not possible at the moment to give a sure interpretation of this partially-excavated building. In its earliest form (Myc) it probably was profane, but was later converted into a temple for the cult of a female divinity. The provenance of some of the dedications can be traced to various regions of Greece. After the destruction of the temple the local population removed all its precious contents, which explains the disturbed stratigraphy." Kombothekraton. Three more tombs in the HL cemetery at Phounteria are reported in ADelt 45. Same. At Odos Ioannou Metaxa, walls, floor and a pit of R date were found, and at Odos Dichaliou walls and pottery of C and HL. (ADelt 44) At Odos Dichaliou, traces of a LR building were found. (ADelt 45) Vathi. Trial excavations at the Naval College revealed six R graves. (ADelt 44) ELEIA (7th Ephorate) Chance finds in Eleia include two bronze hydrias of excellent quality and in a remarkably good state of preservation, one 5th Ct, the other 4th Ct BC, from Roupaki. (ADelt 45) Agia Triada. The systematic excavation in 1990 of a cemetery found in the previous year revealed 11 Myc ChTs from LH IIIA to C, and 15 other graves, mostly without grave goods, of late HL, R and Ott periods. (ADelt 45) Kalyvia Elidas. A marble base was found in the bed of the Peneios, inscribed: 4)IAAAEONTOMENEOP OYFATHP / ANAYXIAA AE FYNA / OEOKOAEOYEA A4POAITA. The name is known from funerary stelai of the 3rd and 2nd Cts BC, and from Pausanias 5.27.12 and 6.14.11 and 16. (ADelt 44) Morea Project. The fifth season of the Minnesota Morea Project took place in July and August 1995 under the direction of F. Cooper and J. Alchermes, who report: "The season was devoted primarily to making scaled drawings of a selection of houses surveyed previously. Field survey was limited to two weeks. The training site for this year was Kato (Nea) Figalia, where we mapped and recorded 38 houses. After this we went to E Achaia, and mapped and recorded 85 buildings in the following villages: Ambelokia, Sinevro, Monastiri, Agia Varvara, Zarouchla, Solos (Pera Meria), Velimis, Agridi, Vella and Likianika. The following villages, which are listed in the Venetian censuses, were examined and eliminated as having too few (in some cases, no) surviving pre-beton houses: Chrisanthi, Ege, Oassi, Seliana, and Perithori. We also continued work on Frankish settlements at Agia Triada, completing work on this citadel, and measuring and drawing the abandoned tower houses at Zarouchla. Examination of the Zarouchla tower houses leads us to be even more firmly convinced that this earlier type of building was the forerunner of the modern Greek vernacular house." Olympia. Continuing in 1995 the project on Olympia in the R Imperial and late antique period, U. Sinn (German Institute) directed excavations in the ruins S of the Leonidaion: "Work at the club house of the Athletes' guild has made such progress that the peristyle and both exercise rooms have been cleared. Important new evidence for the construction history of the building has been found. Two finds confirm that the club house, begun under Nero, was completed in the late</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 17 Fig. 3 1st Ct AD: (i) In the foundation fill of the E wing a sigillata Fig. 4 cup was found with the potter's stamp (AUGUSTUS SALUT- ARIS) of a workshop of the late 1st Ct in the neighbourhood of Rome, and which exported to Greece. (ii) The most interest- ing find of these excavations, seven fragments obviously belonging to two identical inscriptions (Fig. 3). They name Domitian as the dedicator, and can be dated to AD 84, as they include his 6th Imperial Acclamation. These building inscrip- tions confirm the date for completion derived from the stratigraphy. They are also historically interesting, since they show the Flavians completing a building begun with Nero's help. On Greek soil the Philhellene Nero's popularity was such that his successors could not put off the completion of the building. They also give evidence for Domitian's political fate: in AD 96 he was murdered and suffered damnatitio meemoricle. The inscriptions with their naming of the emperor could no longer be displayed in their original form. The slabs were removed from their positions, reversed, put back in the gaps and re-carved with architectural ornamentation (Fig. 4). This datable event gives good evidence for local Peloponnesian building ornament of the Flavian period. Work also continued at the bath complex to the N. The interior of the building was completely cleared. The most interesting discovery was made in the most easterly room (Fig. 5). In the foreground the original mosaic floor of the bath can be seen, dating to the late 3rd Ct AD. After the abandonment otf the bath (probably early 5th Ct) a winery with its wine press was established inside the former bath. The treading tub, with a slightly higher floor which lies over the mosaic, can be seen in the background. The pressed juice flowed through a small opening in the right hand wall into deep tanks previously dug in the neighbouring room. The third (W) room served as a cellar for the wine stored in large amphoras set in the floor. This, however, was not the last use made of the former bath. In the room with the treading tub a stone assemblage can be seen from a workshop of some sort, not more precisely identifiable. It probably belongs to the period after the aban- donment of the settlement by the majority of its inhabitants in the face of the Slav incursions. Architectural study was carried out by K. Herrman. Building Fi 5 1 1. J</page><page sequence="18">18 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 6 material from the bouleterion was moved and catalogued. Thirteen blocks from the middle building were identified and replaced in order on the foundations. In collaboration with J. Knauss a 5m stretch of the S end of the Kladeos retaining wall was uncovered and studied (Fig. 6). It appears that the original end had been destroyed in antiquity. There is a R deposit extending further to the W over its trace. It is uncertain when the original wall was built since it is set in a deep sand and gravel level containing no dateable pottery." ADelt 44 reports that as a result of the widening of a forest road, nine graves were found 500m NE of the new museum. There were no grave goods; the graves are probably Ch. The press reported the discovery early in 1996, on the hill of Kaphkani above Olympia, of a Linear B inscription on stone found in the excavation of a 17th Ct BC sanctuary, and hailed as the oldest written survival of the Greek language. Persaina. At Kastelli, a site 4.5km W of Persaina, a prehistoric settlement was found, with pottery from MH to LH III. Also C pottery, and a R bath building. (ADelt 44) Salmoni. The press reported that during the removal of sand from the bed of the Alpheios a marble model of a Doric temple was found and handed to the authorities by the exca- vator driver. It measures 8 x 17cm and, having 6 x 13 col- umns, was clearly intended as a model of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Zakynthos. The press reported the finding of a shipwreck with a cargo of amphoras provisionally dated to the 2nd Ct AD. MESSENIA ( 7th Ephorate) Ellenika Antheia. Rock cut ChTs were excavated in 1989, dated to LH IIIA2, and LH IIIA2-B, while another, trapezoidal in plan with a gabled roof was LH IIIA1. (ADelt 44) Messene. In the Ergon of the AS for 1995 P. Themelis reports: "The fountain of Arsinoe was entirely revealed and securely identified. Its second repair dates to the 1st Ct AD on epigraphic evidence. The bronze statues on a semi-circular exedra represent members of Augustus' family. ECh buildings (to the E of the Asklepieion) made use of old architectural members, sculptural fragments and inscriptions. Amongst structures predating the Asklepieion were an apsidal building and a large pedestal for a votive offering. Opposite the Bouleuterion is the rectangular enclosure of a grave monument with orthostats on its stepped krepis. Inscribed epistyle blocks scattered around or incorporated in Ch houses probably belong to its superstructure. The memorial was possibly erected by the city of Messene in the 2nd BC to honour ten outstanding persons, whose names are engraved in the nominative case. Inside it were cist graves. The W Stoa of the gymnasion was entered through a Doric propylon, whose four columns were found in situ and the members of its elevation dispersed in the vicinity. Dedicatory inscriptions survive on the epistyle and the metopes, including one recording the gift to the city by a rich Messenian of a thousand denarii for the sacrifices to the Sebastoi and for the provision of oil to both the gymnasia, when Mnasistratos s. of Philoxenidas was Secretary to the Synhedroi. Mnasistratos is known from an inscription dated AD 42 (SEG 38, 1988, 337). From the propylon one descends into a large hall containing the torso of a nude male marble statue, an excellent copy of the Doryphoros by Polykleitos. To the W of this hall lies the n-shaped altar of the temple to Herakles, with its krepis and some orthostats in situ. The crowning member bears a relief frieze depicting animals. The altar contains an interior chamber with an off-centre door. At a short distance stands an oikos supported by a stepped podium. In the room next to the findspot of Doryphoros, two stone pedestals would have supported bronze statuary. A R dedica- tory inscription on the lintel above the entrance records the erection of a temple to Hermes and Herakles by two citizens of Messene. Hundreds of sculptural fragments in this room can be attributed to two cult images of the gymnasion's protector gods, mentioned by Pausanias (IV, 32.1) and assigned to Egyptian artists. The ECh inhabitants were responsible for the shattered state of preservation of these images, but we may still observe that the one of Herakles is an adaptation of the master- piece by Lysipppos. At a distance of 50m N of the gymnasion a seated marble statue of Cybele indicates the existence of a temenos for her." Pylos. F. Cooper reports on the 5th season of the Minnesota Pylos Project: "In the NW area a steel drain set in a bedding of fieldstones and cement runs along the top of wall S and forms a distinctive modern boundary which subdivides the Palace NW area. The westernmost portion on either side of wall S contains a tight complex of walls. A floor is built over the pre-existing construction in this area. It consists of a packing of large angular stones covered by a layer of plaster, a patch of which survives alongside wall S. The so-called platform is a surviving portion of the packed stone base for the plaster floor and this has been destroyed by some unidentified later intrusion.</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 In the W area, sets of walls have become exposed through erosion at the very NW edge of the acropolis. They are obviously earlier than the SW building and appear by orienta- tion and elevation to be related to the earliest construction (phases III-V) found in the Palace NW area. The 'chasm' is a major feature and is pertinent to a number of problems concerning the main building. It is therefore a surprise to find that what is here is quite different from what had been expected from the excavation notebooks and pub- lished reports. Instead of a robber trench this must have been some sort of post-palatial construction. It needs further study and assessment. Two Linear B tablets were recovered this year.

Davis reports on the work of the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project.: "Work included simple revisitation of the archaeological remains in areas investigated in 1992-94, mappng of soils in the valley of Metaxada, in the vicinity of Maryeli and on the ridge on Englianos, and geophysical investigations at Englian- os, Bouka, Dialiskari and Ordines. Two new sites were defined. At Gargalianoi total reconstruction of the church of Ayios Konstantinos involved the grading of the top of the knoll by bulldozer during which stones from the foundations of the old structure were pushed into the maquis that surrounds the clearing in which the church stands. Among the stones are several large ashlar blocks, probably reused from an ancient building. Pottery ranges from HL to EMod in date. HL ceramics are well represented and include fragments from a ribbed kantharos, a moulded bowl and a stamped plate. The Byz period is represented by thickened cooking ware rims. At Analipsi (Gargalianoi) is a single-aisled vaulted church, built in part within a natural cave reinforced with walls of well-cut limestone. Traces of wall-painting are visible in the SW of the nave, where the vault springs from the wall of the church. Further S are various cuttings in the limestone, including small rooms now used as stables for livestock, and, in several cut bedrock scarps, small apsidal niches. Pottery observed at the site ranges from R to EMod, and includes ER sherds, Byz types as early as the 13th Ct, Ott wares of the 15th and 16th Ct and pottery of the 19th Ct. Also observed in 1995 was an ER altar. Soil studies included the mapping of 'soil slumps'-locations where, in a single episode, masses of earth have suddenly slid down the slope of the ridge. At one location NE of the Palace of Nestor, particularly large quantities of Myc pottery were found buried within a deposit of colluvium several metres deep. It is clear that catastrophic erosion of this sort has severely displaced cultural deposits in many parts of the Englianos ridge. Geophysical investigations have confirmed that much of the plan of a large HL building at Bouka (early 2nd Ct BC) has been recovered. This was apparently built and destroyed within one or two generations. Much effort was devoted to the exploration of fields SW and NW of the Palace of Nestor. A large area of approximately ten stremmata was examined by electric resistivity, gradiometry and electromagnetic methods. Many remains of structures are apparent in preliminary plots of data, the most striking of which is what appears to be the remains of a deeply buried wall, at least 50m long, with an estimated width of 3 to 4 m. It is very probable that this is a fortification wall that surrounded the lower town that existed around the Palace of Nestor. Cross-sections measured perpen- dicular to the suspected wall will supply more information about its depth beneath the surface and its thickness." Volimidia. The destruction in mechanical excavation of a Myc ChT is reported in ADelt 45. KERKYRA AND THESPROTIA (8th Ephorate) KERKYRA Ermones. A PR settlement with pottery in two groups EH-MH and MH-LH IIIA was found. Three plots were excavated: at the Mexa plot was an elliptical building, the most significant sherds being LH II; at the Pantelion plot, a cave at the centre contained levels with handmade EH pottery; at the Tzima plot there was EH and MH handmade pottery, with some wheel- made pottery which is probably LH. (ADelt 45) Kerkyra: town. Excavations continued at Figareto, at the Mikalef plot. Two more pottery kilns and three dumps were found in 1989. One dump contained moulds of figurines and idols, the second lamps and the third various types of pottery. Kiln 9 included amphoras of Kerkyra type of the first half of the 4th Ct BC. Four buildings are associated with the working of the kilns. (ADelt 44) In the following year, parts of moulds for large terracotta statues were found, including severe-style females. Other finds were of A lamps, and stamped amphora handles. (ADelt 45) At Palaiopolis, at the A. Kokotou heirs' plot, paving of the ancient agora was found, late HL in date, and at the Kasphiki plot two more rooms of a bath building in use from LR to the 7th Ct AD. At Garitsa, Odos Kyprou 13, the cemetery of the ancient city, in a section which had undergone severe disturb- ance 86 burials of different categories were located. At the NW corner a new stone-built funerary monument, n-shaped, was found. (ADelt 44) Twenty-eight more graves were found at Garitsa in the following year, while at the Kasphiki plot in Palaiopolis, excavation of the drain which surrounded the bath building suggested a date for use of the area from 300 BC to 500 AD. (ADelt 45) At the Vordocheila plot at Figareto, walls were found built over an A level; to judge from the inscribed tiles associated with them, the walls belong to a public building. A lamps and A and C figurines were found. The area is probably one of cult. At the Andrioti plot a funerary stele was found inscribed: £TPATONIKA AAMAPETOY XAIPE, along with other fragments of reused stelai. (ADelt 45) THESPROTIA Gitane. This is one of many fortified settlements in Thesprotia and is identified by the discovery of a manumission decree of the 2nd 1/2 of the 4th Ct BC. It has a grid plan layout. As part of a programme of excavation and training, work was carried 19</page><page sequence="20">20 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 7 out at building A, at the SW corner of the town, which had been subject to illicit excavation. It measures 41 x 31m. The entrance is at the SE, into a courtyard 15.85 x 12.20m, with fragments of columns. Rooms to NE and SE contained coins of Epeiros and Ambrakia dating from 238-168 BC, and a pithos with 178 coins, all bronze, of Philip II, Alexander, Ambrakia, Elis and one from Kerkyra. Rooms on the S side included one with a mosaic floor, and two storerooms. Stamped roof tiles suggest a public building. The stamps include the name (Charopos) of a family which supported the Romans. Also excavated was a small temple, 7.10 x 13m. Finds included a headless statue of a woman, a marble male head and part of a female nude. (ADelt 44) In the following year building B was excavated, measuring 35.20 x 24.50. It produced HL sherds, 30 lamps, bronze brooches and clay figurines. It was divided internally into what appears on plan to be a nave and two aisles, with some cross division at one end, but the roofing arrangements and function remain uncertain. (ADelt 45) Margarition. At Karteri, work for the OTE revealed a wall, probably part of a peribolos tomb. Further construction work did not disturb the cemetery. (ADelt 45) Pegadoulion. At Doliani, roadworks which had not been authorized by the Ephorate resulted in the destruction of many graves. (ADelt 44) Perdikas. At Dymokastro (anc. Elina) following a forest fire, 18 graves were excavated, four of them merely inserted in hollows of the natural rock. Most of the finds dated to the end of the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 44) Smerto. At the Gogolou plot, a building with at least three rooms was excavated. Finds included a silver coin of Ambrakia (360-338 BC) and a bronze coin of Epeiros (238-168 BC). In the cemetery area, five graves were excavated in advance of road works. One grave contained Ch vessels. Another appeared HL in type. Elsewhere in the cemetery, another seven graves were found. (ADelt 44) Further work in the following year revealed seven more graves. (ADelt 45) BOIOTIA (9th Ephorate) No report was submitted to ADelt 44 Chr or ADelt 45 Chr. Palatia Antikyra. The large and important LR/ECh settle- ment on the site of an earlier HL city has been carefully studied, as far as the existence of the modern town will permit. Private houses, secular buildings, an earlier pottery workshop (?) and a five-aisled basilica with mosaic floor (6th Ct) have been uncovered, with finds mostly dating to the 4th-6th Ct AD (coins, lamps, pottery). The relatively good state of preservation of the ruins led the authorities to declare parts of the town archaeological sites, to be developed for public view. (ADelt 45) Ptoion. Christel Muller (French School) reports: "Work in 1995 was directed to cleaning, to facilitate the preparation of new architectural plans. The 'large rectangle' building was partly cleared of undergrowth, and the 'S stoa' completely cleaned (Fig. 7), revealing again walls uncovered in the previous excavations of M. Holleaux at the end of the 19th Ct and of P. Guillon and M. Feyel in 1935-7. Losses since then are painfully obvious; the walls terminating the building to E and W were not found, nor the N-S support wall situated at the W part of the portico. Also missing is the line of headers which formed the first course of the N wall, only the foundations being visible now. Two periods can be distinguished for this building, which measures ca 22 x 6 m. The first phase, probably A, to judge from the records of the earlier excavations, includes the foundations and paving in poros of an elongated building which it is tempting to identify as a temple of Athena Pronaia, because dedications to this goddess have been found in the vicinity. Pottery found in the covering deposits gives no supplementary information about the date since they come from the previous excavations. In the second phase the structure has been remodelled, reusing some of the blocks of poros for the foundations of the N wall of the new building, which has a slightly different orientation from its predecessor (whose paving, in particular, suffered in this reorganization). The foundations were completed with blocks of the local bluish limestone. The stratigraphy of several deposits of pottery, perhaps found undisturbed (though this is by no means certain in view of the disturbance caused by the previous excavations) under the now vanished first course of the N wall in the fill of the foundations, contains only medi- ocre HL material, hardly datable, of which the best pieces are Boeotian BG. The function of this building is uncertain, particularly in view of the missing walls. There is no reason why it should not have been a stoa, in line with the original identification, but there is nothing, apart from its elongated plan, to confirm this, given its present-day state." PHOKIS (10th Ephorate) Amphissa. A large number of rescue excavations are reported: At several places along Odos Ylaithou, during digging for a sewer, sections of the city wall were found from its E side, along the river Gatsopnichti (the ancient Hylaithos). At Odos Delphi and Delmouzou, part of the SE section of the wall, interupted by a paved area, probably the courtyard of a gate. The inner face of the wall was roughly built, probably the result of later repair. The discovery of this section shows that the walls here were located further to the S than was originally thought to be the case. At Odos Diakou and Papachr- estou, a section of the W wall was found. At Odos Giagtzi a section of the wall, with a tower-like</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 projection, runs in a E-W direction. In digging the foundation trench for this, A sherds were scattered. Over these, 4th Ct sherds indicate the date of the wall itself. Other finds include remains of buildings and graves. At Odos Salonon, a grave was found by mechanical excavator. Subsequent controlled excavation revealed eight graves, with rich deposits. In one were 1003 coins, mostly bronze, mostly from neighbouring regions; there was one gold coin of the Aitolian league. At Odos Philotheou Episkopou and Athanassopoulou, graves were found ranging in date fiom EG to 4th Ct BC. This cemetery ceased to be used as a result of the 4th Ct extension of the city wall. (ADelt 44) Distomo. H. Korbou plot: near the mod. cemetery, N of the acropolis, part of the S city wall of ancient Ambryssos was found, with three trapezoidal courses surviving. It shows signs of hasty work, probably by the Thebans in the face of the advance of Philip of Macedon. (ADelt 44) Galaxidi. Excavation in advance of construction work revealed several more sections of the city wall, originally built in the 4th Ct BC. At the plot of A Serapheim. a square tower (5.90 x 4.90m) was found, from the SW corner of the walls. At the plot of St. and E. Daoudi was found part of the N side, 2.80 thick, with two or three courses preserved. Another similar section was in the plot of M. Lourba, and at the plot of K. Papapetrou, a section with a tower 7 x 4.10m. Other sections of the wall were found in the plot of K. Litou, and the neighbouring plot of A. Lemniou, and another section in the plot of P. Pontika. These have been preserved, and add another attraction to this delightful town. (ADelt 44) Kirrha. I. and M. Koureli plot: excavations here produced evidence for three MH houses, with four building phases. House 2 was completely excavated, and had significant remains of two pottery kilns, with a built bench inside on which the material to be fired was placed. More MH houses were found in Odos Polykarpou, some with signs of earthquake damage prior to the earthquake which brought about their final destruc- tion. These houses also included intramural burials. There was an apsidal building of MH date, destroyed by fire, at the plot of A. Kalogerou and M. Palantza, with burials in the destruc- tion level. At the plot of I. and N. Mourtou, a building of megaron plan was found, with Myc pottery. At Odos Plati and Agiou Nikolaou part of a substantial C wall was found, but not the wall of the C city, which is known to run 24m further to the W. Fragments of a wall and a child's cist grave at Magoula represent the most northerly evidence for the extent of the MH settlement. (ADelt 44) Medeon. The press reported that conservation work at the acropolis, to prevent the collapse of the NW tower, produced evidence for a late 4th Ct-early 3rd Ct date of construction. EUBOEA (11th Ephorate) Amarynthos. On the hill called Gerani, remains of EH-MH buildings were found, and at Agia Kyriaki a deposit from the temple of Amarysian Artemis, with rich finds. (ADelt 44) These included clay masks and figurines dating from A to R, including representations of a seated goddess, Artemis with deer and Bendis, figurines of dancers (HL), and A and C pottery. (ADelt 45) Chalkis. At Odos Aliveriou and Amarynthiou, a rock-cut water channel was found, part of the water supply system of the anc. city, while at Odos Arethouses, eight more graves were added to the three excavated ten years previously. All were rock-cut, two being described as of 'Macedonian type', but were robbed. They date to the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 44) Eretria. At Kotroni, 500m N of the Macedonian tomb, a rock- cut tomb was excavated. Traces of other graves in the vicinity suggest the presence of an organized HL cemetery. At the Evangeliou plot three buildings were excavated. One had three rooms, two of them with tiled floors, while under- neath were remains of earlier walls and G pottery. A second building, the other side of a street, was built of large squared poros blocks. All were 5th Ct BC, with finds continuing into HL. At the G. Tanka plot, a cobbled street with buildings to the S was found. An earlier phase was disturbed, and left little pottery. A later phase, on the same alignment as the earlier, had well-built walls. Two lamps indicate a late HL date, continuing into R. (ADelt 45) In 1995, the press reported the discovery of a mosaic pavement dated to the 4th Ct BC depicting a combat between Scylla and a Triton. Limen Aidipsou. At Agios Demetrios, walls of well-cut large blocks, with C and HL pottery. (ADelt 45) Manika. Work continued at the EH settlement and 40 more EH graves were found at the Beliyianni plot, next to earlier discoveries. All were ChTs, with dromoi. They were unrobbed, but not all were in a good state. Many contained only frag- ments of pottery and bones, but there were some graves containing material which showed a distinctly Cycladic context, with 'frying pans', marble cups and figurines. At the A. Papadioti plot, buildings with two EH phases were excavated: an apsidal building 11.20m long, with walls of fieldstone, and a rectangular building. There was a well at the centre of the plot. Abundant pottery was produced, of almost all known EH types. (ADelt 44) In the following year, at the Zousi plot, 19 walls of buildings and a strong boundary or fortification wall were found. This is probably the E boundary of the EH settlement. Rooms were rectangular or trapezoidal in plan, with pebble floors. The pottery was EH II. (ADelt 45) Skyros. At the D. Vachla plot, 11 graves were found in two or three groups. Those of G date are richest, with pottery includ- ing Attic imports, bronze vessels and a Boiotian brooch. At Palamari, excavation of the PR settlement continued. EH rectangular houses were found, separated by narrow strrets, and synchronous with the early cities of Troy and Poliochni, that is, EH II to end of EH III, with final destruction the result of an earthquake. At the Melendi plot, G graves were found. (ADelt 45) NORTHWEST GREECE (12th Ephorate) Two substantial coin hoards from the LByz period were turned in to the Archaeological Service. One found in the village of Romano consisted of 1,071 bronze coins, an assortment of deniers tournois fi-om the reign of John II Orsini (1323-1335). The other, of 1,706 coins, came from Arta and includes six silver Venetian grossi of the 13th-14th Ct and a great number of 15th century torneselli. (ADelt 45) 21</page><page sequence="22">22 R. A. TOMLINSON Arta. Many rescue excavations are reported in ADelt 44, along with a good plan of the modern city and the location of all the (numbered) excavations to date. This gives a much better idea of the anc. city of Ambrakia which underlies the modern town. The report highlights the most important discoveries: at site 1, the late A temple; at 46, the small theatre; at 56, the large theatre, and at 63 a street lined with funerary periboloi of the 6th to the 3rd Ct BC, including the cenotaph of the Ambrakiots and their Corinthian allies. The line of the city walls is now more fully and accurately defined. At site 123, Odos Agiou Vasileiou, sherds of the 8th Ct BC indicate houses of that date. (ADelt 44) Excavations in King Pyrrhos St indicate that this is an area of major public building: the Prytaneion (site 87) has been located here. (ADelt 45) Excavations were begun around the PByz church of the Eleousa, to establish the original construction date within the century 1350-1450. Part of a LByz settlement was uncovered on Kommenou. Buildings therein used anc. spolia from a site on an opposite plot. Rough masonry, two hearths, many mussel shells and much coarse pottery belong to an earlier phase. Also found were 318 much-oxidized bronze coins, possibly a hoard. There were also fine glazed-ware and glassware fragments, some glass with nipple and painted or inscribed decoration. The excavations will provide useful information for ordinary life on the supposed outskirts of the Byz city. (ADelt 44) Kalligonios (Leukas). Part of the N fortification wall of anc. Leukas was found, of HL date. (ADelt 44) Karyotes (Leukas). At the D. and S. Vlachou plot, part of the S cemetery of the anc. city of Leukas was investigated. The graves cover an area 500 x 800m and 82 have been excavated in the previous 20 years; in 1990 a further 104, of various types, were dug. Dates reported range from mid 5th Ct to late HL. (ADelt 45) Kastri Mesopotamon: Kastrios (Preveza). Wall foundations of a 4th Ct BC house are reported. (ADelt 44). Two HL tile graves were found after illicit excavations. (ADelt 45) Koilada Dolianou (Ioannina). At the site of a DEH sub-station, mechanical stripping revealed remains of a PR hut settlement, with hand-made BA pottery with incised decoration, compar- able with Maliq IIb, belonging to the first BA development, and dated 3600-3100 BC. (ADelt 45) Konitsa (loannina). The press reported the completion in 1995 of the excavation at the Litovouni cemetery, 500m distant from the settlement. There are 102 graves from the 12th to the 5th Ct BC. Kouki (Preveza). Two graves are reported, with a coin of Anaktorion, 250-167BC. (ADelt 44) Krya (Ioannina). A prehistoric settlement, with pottery mostly hand-made, is reported: the first phase dates to the 12th-9th Ct BC, the 2nd from the 9th Ct to SG. (ADelt 44) Nikopolis (Preveza). In field 103, part of the R fortification was found, a short distance from the NW tower of the ECh walls. Reused building material includes fragments of unfluted columns. (ADelt 44) In field 102, a square building, 11.10 x 11.94m was found, with orthostats on a euthynteria. Blocks were clamped together with butterfly clamps. The building is surrounded with frag- ments of architecture. Its construction is similar to that of the Actium monument of Augustus. (ADelt 45) A programme of cleaning and conservation work has been initiated at Nikopolis. Material taken to the museum of Nikopolis in 1990 includes an inscription: HHOAIYHNEIK / OnOAEITQNN / EIKOMHAHNN / EIKOMHAOYY / NEIKHEANTAA / KTIATAMEFAAA / HAIAAYYTAAIN / AKTIAAI.IO Riza (Preveza). Excavations have begun on the Riniasa kastron, some 500m from the lonian Sea. The kastron, consist- ing of four enclosures, and with many of its walls well preserved, is identified with Thomokastron, mentioned in 14th Ct. Byz sources. Further Ott additions are attested. (ADelt 44) Soulaidopoulaiika (Leukas). Excavations continue inside the walls of the anc. city, first reported in ADelt 43. Public buildings were found, dating in use from the early 4th to end of the 2nd Cts BC; other walls belong to a later building phase. The structure is perhaps an altar. Plaques with funerary banquets and other scenes were found, of the 4th-3rd Cts BC. The HL levels produced 69 fragments of stamped amphora handles. (ADelt 44) SOUTHERN THESSALY (13th Ephorate) Agioi Theodoroi (Karditsa). At Ampelia, a cemetery was found as a result of illicit excavation W of the anc. city of Kierios. Rescue excavation of the remains showed that it comprised the circle of a destroyed tholos tomb with a dromos. PG and G pottery shows that it was in used for at least 200 years. Bones of horses, cattle, sheep and goats, as well as scattered human bones from the burials, together with bg pottery and Lakonian type tiles show that it was later used as a rubbish dump, after which it was abandoned to the bats whose fine bones covered all this. There is no evidence for cult use. (ADelt 45) Demetrias. In the town, at the Zerva plot, the house partly excavated in 1988 was almost completely cleared. It contained a peristyle court, with four unfluted Doric columns on each side. Three rooms to the E contained an abundance of figurines and lamps, with pottery including bg and West Slope ware, and some Megarian bowls with Trojan War scenes. There are at least two phases for the building, which lasted from the early 3rd to mid-2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 44) Further work in the following year produced indications that this was a bathing establishment, of HL date. Remains of buildings are reported in various other locations. Most interest- ing are those at the Goudara plot, which go back to late A and C and therefore belong to Pagasai, followed by HL and R remains of Demetrias. These include water channels, mosaic floors and a small HL pottery kiln. A cemetery was discovered during the construction of a purification plant for the local water company. Many graves were destroyed because work was started without permission; 21 graves are described, with HL and R pottery. There were two inscriptions: on a painted stele: AYlIA1AnIO1AIOYN1KOn7OA1TO.... and on a stele with traces of red paint: ArAOOYNAYEANAPEIOE / OEPAIOE. (ADelt 45)</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 Dimini. Several excavations produced Myc remains ranging from LH IIIA2 to B2. The construction of a bothros for the prison went through the Myc levels into N, with pottery of Rachmani type as well as the classic Dimini ware. After the removal of a LN wall the grave of a small child was found. A N figurine was found in the trench cut leading to the bothros. (ADelt 44) Excavations were completed at the Kotsali plot, where two Myc houses were found, with rectangular rooms. They produced much material for the latest Myc periods, with a floor level in building K of LH IIIB1, including a large clay bull with painted decoration. A well outside the houses had mixed MH and LH IIA/B material from a depth of 8m to its bottom at 15m. The upper 8m were purely Myc. There is a total absence of LH I material, indicating that the Myc settlement started in LH II, and that this was the time of the introduction of Myc civilization to Thessaly. A built R water channel .85m wide was discovered at the Tsakanida plot. (ADelt 45) Halonnesos. Press reports give details of the discovery of a shipwreck of c. 450 BC. Some of the timbers of the ship are preserved, as well as more than 1,500 wine amphoras from Mende, its cargo. Mitropoli (Karditsa). At Odos A. Papagou, the considerable remains of a R bath building were excavated. Floors included mosaics of very high quality, one showing Europa and the Bull, while another had a central mythological scene. (ADelt 45) Platanos Almyrou: Halos. A cemetery was found near the National Road, with 25 graves, including a reused stele with an inscription: ANTIKPATHE KPATEYOY K/ APIETAPXOX APIXTInnOY. (ADelt 45) Phthiotic Thebes (Nea Anchialos). Further work is reported on tombs and burials of various types, some with funerary inscriptions; also on the remains of part of a large secular building on Maltezou and parts of an octagonal bath house on Angellidi, thus increasing our information on what is one of the most interesting LR-ECh sites in Greece. (ADelt 45) Velestino. At Odos Charalambous and Alkestidos, near the centre of anc. Pherai, a group of Myc ChTs was found. This was succeeded by occupation: SMyc, PG, G, A, C and HL, with buildings recognizable from A to early C. The principal building phase was 4th Ct BC, with two massive terrace walls. (ADelt 44) In the following year four more Myc ChTs were found, and also levels of MH and EH. (ADelt 45) At Odos Pheron, a building phase of late 5th-4th Ct BC, with a floor of beaten earth is succeeded by a LC-EHL pottery kiln dug into its destruction level. This in turn was levelled in the 2nd Ct BC and another building constructed on top. At the plot of K. Kyriazi, in the SE cemetery of C and HL Pherai, four rectangular clay larnakes were found, and also an external burial, a skeleton with a silver coin in its mouth. At the plot of K. Mazaniti, at the S of anc. Pherai, two graves and the base of a funerary monument were excavated. Grave A contained pottery of the 2nd and 3rd 1/4 of the 4th Ct, grave B from early 4th to 2nd Ct BC. There are no other graves in the vicinity, which is inside the walls of the anc. city. (ADelt 44) At Chloe, in the field of D. Riga, a PG tholos tomb was excavated (3.20m diameter) of rough stone. It dates to the mid- 10th- 1st quarter-9th Ct BC. At the toumba where Arvanitopou- los excavated in 1907, construction of a store for cotton revealed 32 graves, 30 of them R, the others C. The R graves include reused material, including two marble stelai. (ADelt 44) Volos. Stratigraphical excavations at Odos Belissariou 38, some 20m from the site of Theocharis' excations, produced at the upper levels evidence for at least two ECh building phases. Next were four building phases of PG and G, with three child burials below them. There was less trace of Myc, but pottery of LH IIIA2, B1-2 and C was found. The MH level was 2m thick, with at least three phases, and produced grey Minyan, red Minyan, matt-painted and polychrome ware. Below this was the water table. (ADelt 44) In the Palea district, the site of anc. Iolkos, a number of trial trenches and excavations have uncovered substantial LR- ECh remains. These include: parts of the ECh city walls including remains of a tower; many architectural members; extensive sections of a bath complex; a section of the Byz walls, repaired during the Ott period; and pit and cist tombs. The area around the present-day church of Agioi Theodoroi contains parts of the ECh walls, a square tower and remains of an ECh basilica resting on an earlier structure (of which the corner of a marble stylobate with cymatium and column sockets were identified) but most of which is today under the modern church. (ADelt 45) PHTHIOTIS (14th Ephorate) Achinos. At the A. Konstantinou plot, more of the HL-R cemetery was excavated, with nine graves and the scattered contents of a tenth. (ADelt 44). At the A. Charisi plot, part of the S cemetery of anc. Echinos was excavated, with various types of grave. Tomb XIII, a marble sarcophagus bore the inscription: CQTHPIC EYNEI/KOY CQ()PQN/ XAIPE. (ADelt 45) Amphikleia: Verantzana (Lokris). After illicit excavation by machine ca 1.5-2km NW of the acropolis of Tithronion, a rectangular structure, with fragments of two marble thrones, was investigated. It was probably part of a funerary peribolos. (ADelt 45) Atalante (Lokris). At various places in the modern town remains of ancient walls are reported, without any substantial finds. Dates range from C to LR. At Odos Alexandrou, seven graves were found belonging to a period after the R city was restricted in size. (ADelt 44) At Spartia, ca 2km SW of the present town, two Myc ChTs were found, with seven graves of the 5th Ct BC situated between them. There were also C burials in the fill of the ChTs. At Odos Nikotsara in the modem town a room was excavated with a tile floor. Finds indicate a PByz date. (ADelt 45) Glypha. The excavation of the C-R cemetery continued. Fifteen graves were investigated. (ADelt 44) At Phanos, more graves were found in the region of the Myc ChT excavated in 1988. (ADelt 45) Hypate (Lokris). At the C. Phitsiou plot, excavations revealed the corner of a large building belonging to R Hypate, of uncertain purpose, dated to the 2nd Ct AD, when Hypate was at its peak. Later buildings were on top. (ADelt 44) In the following year more of the town wall was found E 23</page><page sequence="24">24 R. A. TOMLINSON and SE of the part excavated in 1985/6.

(ADelt 44) 200m NE of the Temple of Artemis, two R tombs, with walls of baked brick, were robbed. (ADelt 45) Zeli-Golemi. Following the illegal excavation of a cemetery of Myc ChTs, seven more, all ChTs, were excavated. Four are dated: XVII LH IIIA2-LH IIIB2; XVIII LH IIIBI; XIX LH IIIB l-early IIIC; and XXII LH IIIC. (ADelt 44) Kyrtoni (Lokris). The rescue excavation is reported, after tomb robbery, of a ChT at the Myc cemetery. The lower levels were found to be untouched, and produced pottery of LH IIIA2-B 1. (ADelt 44) In the following year more tomb robbery is reported at the Myc cemetery at Ag. Ioannis. Rescue excavations were carried out at three more ChTs, with pottery dating them to LH IIIB. (ADelt 45) Lamia. Work was done at Odos Panourgia 22, on eight graves, partly destroyed and containing bg pottery; also at the Kastro, in the area of the Othonian barracks, on the walls of an Ott building and 14 PByz graves. (ADelt 44) At Odos Averoff and Drosopoulou, part of the HL fortifica- tions were found. This and other discoveries in the area complete the plan of the city walls, and modify it from the earlier version by Stahlin. The new discoveries show the turn of the S wall towards the N; at Odos Thermopylon a tile grave, belonging to the S cemetery. Here, graves date from LC-HL. (ADelt 45) There are reports in the press of the discovery in 1995 of a gymnasium at Lamia, destroyed in an earthquake which seems to be later than that of 427 BC. Remains were found near the Phrourion area on the fortress of a settlement from LByz-EOtt period. (ADelt 45) Lokrian Halai (Lokris). At Agios Ioannis Theologos Malesina, a site excavated by the Americans early in this century, 54 graves were found, mostly half destroyed. Dating is uncertain. (ADelt 44) Malesina (Lokris). R ChTs were discovered in the field of K. Anesti, 200m E of the village, and in the field of N. Papaniko- laou, as the result of illicit excavation. There were some traces also of HL use. (ADelt 44) Martinon: cave of Pan (Lokris). In a layer of ash outside the cave, offerings found included a silver ring, and figurines of a female triad as well as of Pan. The cave itself was not investi- gated because of its dangerous state. (ADelt 44) Modi-Skamna (Lokris). At Modion, 6km NE, in an area where no archaeological remains were known, tomb robbers found a cemetery of Myc ChTs. These were investigated: tomb II is LH IIIC-SMyc, tombs III-V LH IIIA2-LH IIIC. (ADelt 44) In the next year, another eight tombs were excavated. (ADelt 45) Neo Monasteri (Domokos). At the N. Natoudi plot levels were found with pottery ranging from BA (very little ) to C. (ADelt 45) Oita. At the 'Pyre of Herakles' systematic excavations produced R coins (aes grave), and, in the ash, a coin of Alexios Komnenos. (ADelt 44) In the following year, abundant coins were found, and a late A metal plaque with a helmeted head of a warrior. (ADelt 45) Pyrgos Livanaton: Kynos (Lokris). At Pyrgos Livanatou, systematic excavation was carried out of a LH II building, having a storeroom with pithoi on its floor and sherds of good quality pottery, presumably fallen from an upper floor. Everywhere there were traces of destruction by fire, dating to LH IIIC. By the E wall of the storeroom are the remains of a LH IIIC-SMyc floor, with infant burials. There are children's cist graves elsewhere. Another storeroom was destroyed by earthquake early in LH IIIC. (ADelt 44) More of the settlement was excavated in the following year, all with the destruction level. More of the HL wall surrounding the hill was uncovered. (ADelt 45) Raches Phournoi. Further excavations were carried out at this PR settlement. At the G. Papadelou-I. Rammou plot, two trenches were opened, the first producing the remains of a large apsidal building together with four pits, the second a stratum of large and medium size stones and levels with mudbrick buildings. Pottery comes from different BA phases. The site is compared with Manika in Euboea. (ADelt 44) Rengini (anc. Naryka) (Lokris). At this neighbour of Lokrian Aias, a room was found with a mosaic floor, badly destroyed. (ADelt 45) Stylis. On the site of the Biozum factory a building with at least three rooms is reported, similar to 4th Ct BC houses, with pottery dated to the 5th and 4th Cts BC. (ADelt 44) More houses of the same date were found in Odos Valaori- tou, and at Odos Lamias 11 a large cist grave, with BG pottery. (ADelt 45) Topoliana. At Kastraki, the remains of houses of the 3rd-2nd Ct BC were found. (ADelt 44) NORTHERN THESSALY (15th Ephorate) Agiokampos. Further excavations were conducted to determine the limits of this settlement. Parts of the fortification wall, together with a tower, were found. It appears that this small settlement was fortified at the time that Thessaly was con- trolled by Macedon, probably during the reign of Antigonos Gonatas. It would seem to have been destroyed after the battle of Pydna. (ADelt 44) Krannon. At Sarmanitsa, W of the acropolis, a cemetery of 19 graves was found. I-X are ca 470 BC, XI-XIII and XV-XX 1st 1/2 of the 5th Ct BC, while XIV and XXI (cist graves) and a clay larnax XXII are later. (ADelt 44) Larisa. At the corner of Odos Roosevelt and Patroklos the remains of two HL buildings were excavated. A was in use throughout the HL period, B in the 2nd and 1st Cts BC. Both were private houses. (ADelt 44) At Odos Galati 12, two marble osteothekai, four vase burials, four tile graves and two cist graves, dating from mid 3rd to end- 1st Ct BC were found, belonging to the S cemetery of Larisa. (ADelt 45) At the junction of Mavili and Nirvana, an ECh and Byz cemetery and building remains were uncovered. Three cist and</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 25 58 pit graves were found, all with Ch burials. Coins and pottery point to a Byz-LByz date, excepting one cist tomb lined with marble plaques. Under the burial deposits, part of an EByz road was discovered, apparently associated with the few building remains that were found. Pre-Ch buildings were encountered below the Ch levels. At the junction of Patroklou and Roosevelt, a LR mosaic floor was found and removed. The central decoration consists of a number of panels surrounded by a running spiral border, each with individual animal or geometric relief, and one with an anthropomorphic mask. (ADelt 45) Neromyloi Agias. At the K. Vlachokosta plot a R bath building with mosaic floors was excavated. It was built of brick, and had the full range of facilities. Building style and finds indicate a date in the 1st half of the 2nd Ct AD. (ADelt 45) Trikkala: Asklepieion. A test excavation of this complex, originally excavated by Theocharis, was carried out. Phase A dates to the 1st half of the 1st Ct AD, phase B to the 2nd quarter of the 3rd Ct AD. There are some fine mosaic floors from the first period, with Dionysiac themes. (ADelt 44) Zarko. At the anc. city of Hestiaiotis Phayttys, a chance find of graves of the 2nd Ct BC is reported in ADelt 44. More important are the excavations at Platia Magoula, at the PR settlement. which were completed. Fortunately a dry year lowered the water table, enabling the excavations to reach a greater depth, down to the stereo. The lowest level was dated to the transition from early to mid N. Above this are traces of buildings. The upper levels are BA. Radiocarbon dates from the levels at a depth between 8.5 and 9m are all a little later than 6000 BC. (ADelt 45) Among material taken to the Museum at Larisa is an inscription on a white marble stele from Kreni Pharsalon. It dates to the 2nd Ct BC, on a reused stele of perhaps the 3rd Ct: 'Hv yioopx c6Tfikriv unec£CfV E/Cop(x 0(i£ tivOouS. /KlOT0oave yap Zcof otvoga /Kcr|aKoX rvrl. /' OKTCOKatx£K-- TS X£fio/a/oa yove£ot 6aCKpuoa /KOCi inranlrot T&amp; 6OpotIO. oi'/£ep yairS kfE tv6rl. /' Hv 65 y6Co £EuX60£eia a kIc/rlC T£ TrKVOV &amp;WCpOV, /Ou T£EX0VTOo. &amp;C0)oVOS /XiEv (aoS ioeXto1o. /nHve£b6 5i mtfp Xeiov /6aKppu 06K£ T65' Epyov /o6v T£ Oikrl &amp;Xk6XO0. o01 flv /T£KvoV ev rT KO6K &amp;kko. /0168t y6p t; aTf( i Xov /Te:KVOV 0)Ti '1t0of6(Tr /6aXt. &amp;T£KOlvo0t Xkn KOCp/TlpEOV ioTov.

They are part of a larger cemetery. Chalkidike Agios Mamas. At the cemetery of Kassandreia, four stone sarcophagi and six other graves were found in 1989. The five biggest graves seemed to belong to a family group. Three further C-HL graves were found in 1990. (ADelt 44 and 45). Ierissos. The cemetery of Akanthos was investigated in 1989 (511 graves) and in 1990 (a further 186 graves), mostly C or LC. Most were inhumations, arranged on three superim- posed levels. Older graves date back as far as the 7th Ct. (ADelt 44 and 45) Kallithea of Kassandra. The press reported the discovery at the locality Frangokastro of a large church, Constantinopoli- tan in quality. Mende. At Proasteion, in the 9th-4th Ct BC settlement, the road E of the 4th Ct house A was found to date from the end of the 5th Ct. House B, of the 2nd half of the 6th Ct had on its floor a large marble ring, apparently used for fishing. Lower levels produced evidence for the destruction by fire of two houses at the end of the 7th or beginning of the 6th Ct BC. Beneath this was much local pottery with G designs. (ADelt 44) In the following year, circular stone structures with walls identified as a house produced pendant semicircle skyphoi of the mid-8th Ct and a little later. Similar circles exist at Lefkandi and are identified as bases for wooden corn stores. (ADelt 45) At the coastal cemetery 174 graves were excavated in 1989 and a further 241 in 1990. Most burials are in amphoras or medium sized pithoi, with the mouth facing the sea; the vast majority of them are of children. They date from the end of the 8th and the 7th Ct BC, with a few from the 6th Ct BC (ADelt 44 and 45) At Poseidi, foundations excavated in 1989 produced sherds with dedications to Poseidon (an interesting survival of the name to the present day). (ADelt 44) In 1990 building A, 8.35m wide and aligned E-W, was identified as the temple, and given a terminus post quem of the mid-6th Ct. It probably dates to the early 5th Ct BC. Building B is older, and partly incorporated in A. (ADelt 45) Nea Roda. In 1989, a R pottery kiln for tiles was found. (ADelt 44) In 1990, excavations of the sanctuary and house produced Cor roof tiles painted in three colours (yellow, off-white and brown) from the last quarter of the 6th Ct BC. Also a destruc- tion level with pottery of the late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC, and a marble bearded head of the late 4th Ct. (ADelt 45) B. Isserlin reports that laboratory examination of core samples taken from the Xerxes' canal area suggests that, if this is Xerxes' canal, it was open only for a short time before being backfilled, at least in the location sampled. Olynthos. In 1989, excavation at house BVIII showed that there had been alterations made to it. (ADelt 44) Polychrono. At Geromoiri the excavation of the house dating to the end of the 6th Ct BC was completed. It was probably destroyed by an earthquake, at the end of the 5th Ct. Excavation of another group of houses, with two phases, at the beginning and end of the 6th Ct BC, suggests that this was a densely-packed settlement. At Nyphi, further excavation of the cemetery brings the total number of graves discovered to 49, dating from the mid-6th to the end of the 4th Ct BC, i.e. the later phase of the settlement. (ADelt 44) In the following year, excavation at the plot of C. Goule revealed evidence of the PR settlement: terrace walls and a pottery kiln with sherds from large vessels and cups, dating to the advanced EH period. 50m NE of this are buildings of the LR period. (ADelt 45) Potidaia. At plot 197, a large R house with good marble floors was excavated in 1989 and 1990. In 1989 the corner of a HL house was found in the modern village and, 1.5km to the S, the foundations of a complete house with bg plaques and two small coin hoards. One of these contained a gold stater of Alexander the Great and five silver tetradrachms, the other had 30 silver coins (8 tetradrachms, the rest drachms). In field 324, another HL building produced 42 bronze coins. (ADelt 44 and 45) The press reported the discovery in 1996 of a Byz ship- wreck off Potidaia, with a cargo of wine amphoras.</page><page sequence="26">26 R. A. TOMLINSON Sithonia. At Parthenonas, at a locality called Kostas, 15km from this deserted village (probably anc. Parthenopolis) a hill- top cult area was identified, with the natural hollows of the rock filled with stones to serve as places for burnt sacrifice. Pottery dates the use to the 6th and 5th Cts BC. The name of Zeus is read, tentatively, on a sherd of the 5th Ct, and the cult identified accordingly as that of Zeus Koryphaios. Use continued into the 4th and 3rd Cts BC, gradually declining. (ADelt 45) Stageira. Excavations were started in 1990 in which two large walls were identified as part of a workshop. Another trench on the N side of the hill revealed remains of the C and HL city walls. The HL wall, very well preserved, is 1.70m thick. (ADelt 45) Dion. The press reported the discovery by Professor D. Pander- malis of an inscription giving the text of a letter from King Antigonos, the find spot of which identifies the Temple of Zeus. Further excavation has revealed the site of the stadium, which will now be the subject of a large-scale excavation. Europos. With the support of the Demos of Axioupolis, work began in 1989 on the archaeological sites of the area, starting with excavations at Europos, 1 km S of the village of Ampelia. In the town area a search for the city walls instead produced remains of a R house. Excavations of the cemetery produced 31 graves and more work was done at the large R vaulted three-chamber tomb, built of poros to a height of 1 m and then of baked brick. Most of the graves were robbed, but one produced an inscription, reused as a lid: H IOAIX /MAAP- KON INITHION AEYKIOY YION /AYTOKAPTOPA /TON EATHI EYEPFETHN. The subject may be one of Antony's officers at Actium, identified by Plutarch (Antony 65).

Remains of a 14th Ct garrison kitchen were identified, but only two ancillary structures related to the church were found, along with a tower, cistern and a guard ramp over the N wall of the church. Part of the ECh walls were also discovered, with masonry details (arches) similar to those of Justinianic monuments in Syria and N. Africa. (ADelt 44) Excavations were done around the W gate and towers. The MByz threshold of the gate was built onto the burnt remains of a wooden gate of the end-12th/early-13th Ct, the destruction possibly to be associated with the 4th Crusade. The destruction layer contained a 4th Ct funerary relief (rider, possible original- ly used as a gate lintel) and 12th Ct Byz pottery. Further investigations of the walls were made. (ADelt 45) Louloudies. The press reported the excavation by Mrs E. Marki of the 9th Byzantine Ephorate, of a Byz fortified township, a quadriburgium, at this site 10km S of Pydna, in advance of the realignment and doubling of the main railway line from Athens to Thessalonike. The fortified square includes a church (36 x 19m) and a building tentatively identified as a bishop's palace (42 x 24m). In addition, there is a two-cham- bered tomb with wall paintings including a cross and a pheasant. It is suggested that the settlement was founded in connection with the establishment of Theodoric's Goths in Greece, and was fortified in the time of Justinian. It was destroyed by fire after an earthquake at the beginning of the 7th Ct AD. In connection with this excavation, and at the invitation of Mrs Marki, a geophysical and physical survey was carried out at this site under the direction of Dr A. Poulter. Dr Poulter reports: "The task here was to ascertain whether or not the quadri- burgium was at the centre of a larger settlement. An EDM topographical survey of the entire area defined by the permit (17ha) was completed, and a topographical and location plan drawn up (1:1000). Geophysical exploration (resistivity) was confined to fields covered with stubble, whereas the pick-up surveys were successfully carried out in standing crops of cotton. For areas selected for intensive survey, total pick-up was carried out within transects, each subdivided into 5 x 5m squares. Brick and tile were weighed on site, small finds were plotted and pottery bagged for analysis and quantification, to be carried out before the summer of 1996. To the S of the quadriburgium the pick-up survey found EByz building material and pottery, together with marble finds (notably capital fragments) which represented the spread of material from the excavated site at first diminishing in quantity, but then increasing sharply at a distance of ca 150m from the fortification. In the S half of the survey area, transects at a distance of 250m from the quadriburgium located a dense spread of EByz material, notably brick, including bricks stamped with EByz monograms, extending S for a distance of c. 100m before terminating abruptly at a bluff overlooking lower ground to the S. Transects on the S edge of the survey area found no evidence for occupation to the S of this escarp- ment. A pick-up survey immediately to the NW of the quadri- burgium produced, in addition to a restricted spread of EByz material, C/HL sherds, no doubt related to the HL site current- ly being excavated by the Classical Ephorate, immediately to the NE of Mrs Marki's excavations and little more than 70m from this survey area. Click surveys to the W of the quadribur- gium found no further evidence for occupation. Small finds included: 29 bricks with EByz monogram stamps, fragments of EByz column capitals, part of a marble sculpture, glass tesserae, a loom-weight and ceramic counters. The resistivity survey found no evidence for structures immediately to the W of the quadriburgium, but did locate a high resistance feature to the E, just possibly a paved road. However, in a stubble field ca 250m SE of the quadriburgium, the clear outline of a rectangular building was discovered, measuring ca 20 x 20m with apparently an interior courtyard and rooms along two of its sides. On the same axis and ca 30m to the W, a conspicuous high resistance anomaly, 135m in length, orientated NW by SE and ca 3m wide, crossed this same field and had three protrusions on its E side. These were regularly spaced at intervals of ca 30 m, and there was another at the SE corner, where the feature turned W at a slightly oblique angle to follow the crest of the escarpment running W- E, noted during the pick-up survey. To the N, beyond the intervening railway line, the same anomaly was identified where it turned abruptly at right angles and headed SW. There can be no doubt that this represents the E side of a fortification wall, equipped with towers and possibly a central gate, and which was approximately 180m in length. This feature was visible on the surface as a slight mound crossing the field, along the course of which were blocks of typically EByz white mortar, with an admixture of roughly crushed brick fragments.</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 In addition, the same field produced bricks with EByz mono- gram stamps. It also seems likely that results of the field survey may be related to this feature. The marked increase in EByz building material ca 150m S of the quadriburgium was ca 70m W of the NE corner of the new fortification and on the same alignment as the return for the NW side of the defences. Moreover, the concentration of EByz building material found to the S of the railway line is ca 170m W of the NE curtain wall and, like the geophysical anomaly, stops abruptly where it meets the bluff overlooking low land to the S. It may well be that the pick-up surveys have located building debris from the NW and SW sides of the fortification. If this preliminary interpretation is correct, the fortified enclosure measured c. 170 by 180m. Apart from the evidence for C/HL settlement to the N of the quadriburgium, it appears that there were no other major buildings in the immediate area of the excavated EByz site. However, some 150m to the S there was a large fortification, almost certainly of EByz date, and ca 3 to 4ha in size. Since its SE side respects the bluff overlooking lower ground to the S, this suggests that the escarpment may have been a topo- graphic feature in antiquity, perhaps an ancient shore line or, more probably, the W limit of salt marshes. How the fortifica- tion wall relates to the building to the E remains uncertain. Conspicuous, however, is the difference in the nature of resistance features inside and outside the fortification. To the E of the fortification wall, apart from the building, and possibly another building on the same alignment, the level of resistance was remarkably uniform, whereas inside the fortifi- cation, a network of high resistance features suggests that the interior may have been densely occupied by buildings. Although further work is required to analyse the results, these preliminary conclusions suggest that there existed, to the S of the quadriburgium, a previously unknown EByz site of notable importance, to judge from its impressive fortifications and size." Olympos region. Two EIA tombs are reported, one at Karouli tou Veli, the other at Kastraki-Ag. Vasilis. Neither was covered with a mound. (ADelt 44) Palatiano. Press reports give details of excavations at the Sanctuary of Dionysos. Two HL buildings were found, one a metallurgical workshop, with material dating 1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD. A mould for a figurine of the Egyptian god Bes was found. The site is in general identified as the ancient Ioron, as important for its sanctuary as its strategic position. anc. Petra region. At Treis Elies, a cemetery was found, dating from transitional LBA to EIA; 55 graves were exca- vated. Pottery begins with Myc followed by SMyc and PG, together with hand-made wares. At Kalogeros another cemetery dates to the first phase of the EIA, similar to other cemeteries at Rachi and Petra. (ADelt 44) Pydna: Makrygialos (N cemetery of Pydna). In 1989 EIA graves were found in field 947. Probably these were originally all covered with low mounds, but these are now eroded. Other graves date from the period after the Persian Wars until the end of the 5th Ct, when the population of Pydna was resettled elsewhere by Archelaos after a rebellion. Use of the cemetery was resumed from the 2nd quarter of the 4th Ct, when the population returned. (ADelt 44) Further similar results came from excavations in 1990, when it was observed that the returning population seems to have resumed the use of the graves of their ancestors. (ADelt 45) Therme. Work continued at the N settlement, with the uncovering of structures identified as workshops, with clay floors. (ADelt 44) At the cemetery area, excavations in 1989 and 1990 produced many more graves, the total found now reaching 303. They range in date from the EIA to the 4th Ct BC, the majority being of the 6th and 5th Cts. The cemetery was well organized, with recognisable orientation of the graves, groupings of graves, and paths between them. (ADelt 44 and 45) The press reported continued excavation at the settlement in 1995, by Professor Tiberios of the University of Thessalonike. Pottery found in the houses is identified as coming from Chios, Miletus, Samos, Euboea, Corinth and Athens. Work was also done by the Ephorate at the cemetery, where graves of the 6th and 5th Cts BC were found. Thessalonike Agora. Work was resumed in 1990 at the point where it had been stopped in 1971. Levels dating from the time of the 1917 fire down to building phases of the 15th and 16th Cts AD were investigated. Houses of the 18th and 19th Cts were aligned along a road on the axis of the modern Odos Philippou, which is to be identified with the Odos Eidolon. The early Ott buildings changed the character of the area, but maintained the alignment of the R agora. The cryptoporticus was cleared of fill. (ADelt 45) Hellenistic walls. Clearing of the E city walls below the triangular tower revealed part of the HL wall, of large blocks, six courses of which are preserved; the wall was 1.40m thick. There is a second, later section a few metres to the N which was later concealed within the R wall, and the ECh wall was built against this. Excavations in 1989 at Odos Kassandrou-Makedonikos Amynis-Pasteur revealed six building phases, two HL, the rest R. The first HL phase indicated a building with a NW-SE orientation. The 4th phase was a large building of the 2-3rd Ct AD, and in use till the 4-5th Ct. In Odos Selukidou 4, part of a large R building of unknown purpose and date, previously observed in the adjacent plot, was excavated. (ADelt 44) In 1990, at Odos Apellou 5, excavations revealed a massive wall, 2.70m thick, with a vault to the E. To the W of this was a curved wall carrying equally massive bases. At the centre was a vaulted room with two marble staircases. Taken in conjunction with adjacent discoveries there is no doubt that this is part of a very large building designed for shows, the 'Theatre called Stadium' of Byz sources, and the largest building in Thessalonike after the hippodrome, in use from the time of Antoninus Pius till the end of the 4th Ct AD. It is the place for the games dedicated to Apollo which took place in the mid 3rd Ct. The structure has an overall width of clOOm. It is of great importance for the further elucidation of the topography of the ancient city. (ADelt 45) The press reported the discovery, during digging for a gas pipeline, of an ECh church at the junction of Agios Demetrios and Langadas Streets. This is preserved to a height of 2m and with it are graves of HL to the 6th Ct AD. At Saranda Ekklesi- es, in the E cemetery of the ancient city, a built tomb was found with Ch wall paintings dating to the late 3rd or early 4th Ct AD. At Odos Gregoriou Palama 8 a mosaic floor was found, part of an extension of the Palace of Galerius. As always, numerous Byz excavations and rescue digs are reported, including many tombs and cisterns. The most important finds are important and high quality drainage and water supply works on Isidorou 6 and Ikarias 7, which suggest that water supply was a more complex in ECh and Byz periods 27</page><page sequence="28">28 R. A. TOMLINSON than had been thought. Dating and extent of the city's general water supply system is still problematic. (ADelt 44) North of the Agios Demetrios cemetery, outside the walls, 118 ECh tombs and burials were located. The tombs were mostly barrel-vaulted on an E-W orientation and organized neatly in rows. Sixteen were found undisturbed with rectangu- lar altar-like structures on top of their vaulted roofs, possibly tomb markers. Twelve inscribed funerary stelai assisted in dating. Burials that may be Byz were discovered in excavations undertaken around the church of Profitis Elias. Part of a bath house with 5th Ct mosaic floor was uncovered on Olympou 140, possibly related to part of a similar structure excavated on a neighbouring plot in 1971. Continuing excavations on Menelaou-Egnatias-Met. Gennad- iou, SE of the R agora, uncovered more of an extensive R structure and possibly later structures associated with the attested 9th Ct Prodromou monastery, whose katholikon was located in 1933. Two buildings were investigated, one LR-ECh with mosaic and marble flooring, and the second a Byz building constructed over it. Further on, on Egnatias, the building phases ranged from LR to Ott. General interpretation of the finds is: original phase 4th Ct; second and third phases end-4th to mid-Sth Cts; Byz phase 9th-10th Ct; workshop remains from the 14th-15th Ct; and finally Ott. A complex assemblage of tombs, cisterns, unidentified structures, water channels and workshop kilns were located in excavations for the new Byzantine Museum outside the Walls (East cemetery). (ADelt 44) Excavations at Lapithon 7 revealed a large, much-ruined ECh house with fine mosaic floors. The house follows the natural incline of the hill and is one of the first examples in Thessalonike to have been built against an embankment. Mosaics (star, geometric, bird and foliate motifs, with inscrip- tion) and wall-paintings (opus sectile and marble imitations) are among the few found in a secular ECh building, and were being used up till the 6th Ct. The site is to be preserved. In Plateia Kyprion Agoniston, R and ECh building remains were found (with ECh mosaic floor) underneath Byz burials of the 12th Ct, four of which were undisturbed cist tombs used for multiple burials. A MByz church or monastery must have existed nearby. Another important group of burials was found on the plot surrounded by Langada-Galanaki-Ivanof, including an enclosed complex of nine ChTs in excellent condition, containing the remains of about 40 people of all ages and both sexes. Abundant coins date the complex to the second half of the 4th Ct. Moveable finds included pottery, lamps and toilet items. For the first time, a marble trapezophoros based on the well-known type of the Good Shepherd was found in a burial context. Important remains of a large R public building were found Prasakaki-Koukkouphli (50m N of Agia Sophia); a second ECh phase seems to be associated with coins of Constantine I and in MByz times it had been reused as an industrial workshop. A similar R secular complex was discovered on Dem. Gounari 47 and Pat. Ioacheim. On top of these remains, phases dating to ECh, Dark Age, two Byz and LByz periods were identified. Excavations were made in the Rotonda, in the area under the sanctuary barrel vault. What appear to be the original forms of altar and synthronon were established. (ADelt 45) Toumba. Excavations at Odos Empedokleous 17 revealed two buildings and a water channel, dated by pottery finds to the mid 5th Ct BC, and in use till the end of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 44) At Ano Toumba there were excavations at Odos Kalavrytou 23, of levels above the PR settlement, which revealed building remains, badly damaged in recent activities, dating from the 6th to the 4th Ct BC. At no 19 in the same street, were found strata dating from the 9th Ct BC, followed by 6th Ct, then a destruction ca 570-550 BC, and houses of the 5th and 4th Cts. WESTERN MACEDONIA (17th Ephorate) Aiani (Kozane). Excavations continued in 1989 and 1990 at the cemetery at Leivadia. Three periods of burial are identified: LH (producing a combination of matt painted pottery and Myc wares); A and EC (trench graves once containing wooden coffins; finds include iron models of wagons, one pulled by two bronze animals); and HL (poor grave offerings). (ADelt 44 and 45). At Outsina, NW of Leivadia, part of a bath complex was found, in good condition, with small marble pillars as hypocaust supports. It contained R and Byz material. (ADelt 44) Asomata (Emathia). A two-chambered rock-cut tomb was dated to the 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 45) Edessa. At Odos Heroon Polytechneiou and Archelaou, part of the known cemetery W of the acropolis was excavated and 41 graves were found, dating to the 2nd-4th Ct AD. There was one grave containing the remains of a mother with two children. A small inscribed marble gravestone reads: ZOcTupoS /6 Kc£ ATTCa /16)v KaCi cv e/7toitre ac£ cD/TO)C Vfliq /Xaptv. It dates to the 2nd or 3rd Ct AD. At Odos Korai, part of the city wall was excavated. At a distance of 6m outside this part of the Byz proteichisma was found. At Odos Egnatias, graves of the ECh cemetery were excavated, including the dromos of a large vaulted tomb, the chamber of which is under the modern street. The graves date to the 4th to the 6th Ct AD. At Longos, the lower town of ancient Edessa, part of the N line of the city wall was uncovered, having a width of 2.40m and a preserved height of 1.70m. The lower part is late R, the upper ECh. A tower measures 4 x 4m internally. (ADelt 45) Kamara: Valavani field (Naoussa). The excavation is reported of a large HL house, having a peristyle with a room 10 x 7m on its S side. Here, and on the E side, there was probably an upper floor, the ground floor room serving as a store. The pottery dates the house to the 2nd Ct BC, when it was part of the ancient city of Mieza; it was altered in the 1st Ct BC when an atrium with impluvium was constructed in it. This has a floor of opus signinum with a geometric pattern. Such work is not found elsewhere in Greece, except at Delos, and it is suggested that it was probably carried out by R craftsmen. (ADelt 45) Kastoria. At Dispilio the press reported the finding of part of a flute dated to the 6th millennium BC, the oldest musical instrument known from Greece. Kitrini Limni (Kozane).

Excavations were carried out in 1988, 1989 and 1990 at Rachi tou Vasilia, where a PR settlement was reported by Rey. In 1988 a building with 4th and 3rd Ct BC phases was excavated, with another building of similar date to the SW. On top of the toumba a corner of a 3rd Ct building was found, which in the following year produced material down to the end of the Macedonian monarchy. In 1900, on the third hill to the S of the Toumba, a cemetery of R graves, and one EIA grave was found. (ADelt 45) Pella. The press reported the excavation, following illegal digging, of a Macedonian tomb in mound I of the W cemetery. There is no architectural decoration. There is a dromos, 15 x 1.9m, originally covered with wood, and the tomb itself is covered with a continuous vault. It contained three sarcophagi, with reused 4th Ct stelai as lids. It has an antechamber 2.9 x 3.9m and the funerary chamber is 3.9m square, with iron nails on the walls to hang decorations. It is not clear whether this tomb is included in other press reports which tell of the discovery in 1995 of three large Macedonian tombs of the 4th- 3rd Ct BC at Pella. This one is dated to the 2nd 1/2 of the 3rd or early 2nd Ct BC. Ptolemais (Kozane). The press reported the finding of a settle- ment dating from HL to the 4th Ct AD. Pyrgos Eordaia (Kozane). The press reported discovery in 1995 of a Macedonian tomb with a plain facade, the tomb measures 2.83m square, and is dated to the 2nd half the 4th Ct BC. Rymnio (5km from Aiani, on the RH bank of the Haliakmon). After two Myc alabastra were handed in to the authorities, excavation revealed HL, R and Byz remains in an area levelled by machine. Eight graves dating to the 8th-7th Ct BC were also found. (ADelt 45) Velvedo (Kozane). Walls and floors of a N settlement at Vasilara Rachi are reported in the press. Veroia. Various finds are reported: graves with A material in Odos Ploutarchou; a stone paved R street with wheel ruts running NE-SW in Odos Paster. In Odos Patroklou, part of a R bath, with remains of marble wall cladding and a mosaic floor with a geometric design. In Odos M. Alexandrou, part of a large building complex lasting from HL to Ott. One building here has mosaic floors, and is dated to the 3rd Ct AD. Most interesting, however, is a square structure at Odos Kentrikis and Vermion. Measuring 13 x 13m on the foundations, this has a floor of marble slabs and a marble toichobate. A circular structure at the centre was edged with slabs, and probably supported either a nymphaeum or some honorific monument. It is not easy to date, but from the construction appears to be ER. It stood for a long time, and was probably situated at the centre of the agora. A large poros base immediately to the S supported a marble exedra. (ADelt 45) The press reported the discovery during waterworks trench- ing in 1995 of a marble statue 1.95m high, including a base but without the head, which is missing. EASTERN MACEDONIA (18th Ephorate) Aedonochori (anc. Tragilos). Continued excavations revealed 13 graves in the S cemetery, dating to the end of the 6th Ct BC, and 21 in another trench excavated at the same cemetery, dating from the end-6th to mid- 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 44) Half of building r was excavated in 1990; it measures 26.15 x 17.20m, with a central courtyard; from the plan,it appears to be a house. Thirty-one bronze coins give a date of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct to the early 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 45) (The press reported the discovery at a place variously called Achladochorio or Aedonochorio of a N settlement.) Amphipolis. To the right of the road to the ancient city from the National Road, nine graves were found in the field of A. Barbouti. Most skeletons had a bronze coin in the mouth or hand. One grave had a silver drachma of Demetrius Poliorketes. All the graves date to the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 44) Ch. Bakirtzis reports in the Ergon of the AS for 1995 that following the removal of its mosaics for conservation reasons, basilica C was excavated. Beneath its central nave, two rooms belonging to a R building were found. After the mid-6th AD the intercolumniations along the axis of the basilica were walled up, impeding communication through the aisles. Across the S aisle runs a built conduit which passes through the thickness of the wall and joins an uncovered duct for the rain water of the atrium. To the S of the rotunda is a structure buried beneath the foundation of the hexagonal stylobate of the Ch building. This reused ashlars from older edifices. Cist-graves built of dado slabs from the walls of the rotonda suggest that the circular building was half-destroyed and abandoned in the 7th Ct AD. Dikili Tash. Rene Treuil reports on the contribution of the French School to this joint project in 1995. Work continued to uncover the remains of N habitation, producing traces of daub and post walls dating to the beginning of LN, and walls, floors etc. of late MN. Finds include botanical material (lentils, peas, wheat, vetch). Animal remains show a high preponderance of cattle and pigs, confirming previous observation from MN levels. Archaeological material included abundant pottery, numerous pieces of chalcedony, flint and quartz, polished axes, millstones and ornaments (beads, bracelets and pendants, as well as an anthropomorphic figurine). The most interesting finds were the muzzle of a ruminant, modelled in terracotta, probably on a wooden core, and a bucranium modelled in terracotta. Ch. Koukouli-Crysanthaki reports in the Ergon on the work of the AS for 1995. Excavations in building 4 shed light on parts of its exterior and partition walls, as well as on its internal arrangement. Kilns were discovered inside all three rooms of the building, situated opposite the respective entrances, with a curved upper side and a semicircular opening. Beside the kilns were basin-shaped clay structures or solid benches attached to the walls. Vessels were found on the floor, which bears traces of fire, being covered with clay from the thatched roof. Objects related to nutrition were discovered: stone pestles, plates, pots with lugs. Remarkable are the miniature cups and the incised deep bowls. Large storage jars of unbaked clay are positioned inside the rooms with reference to the kilns. The stratum of the burnt roof contains stone tools (blades), spindle whorls, pendants of bone or shell; the scarcity of figurines is notable.

Outside there is a large quantity of late HL pottery, and coins from the independent mints of Pella and Thessalonike (187-168 BC). At the centre of the enclosure was an altar. Offerings found include a bronze plaque inscribed: Q PETRO[NIUS /FIRMUS.[ ---/COH.V PRAET[ ---/EX VOT[O. The destruction of the sanctuary is dated by coins of Constantine the Great. It seems to have been founded at least by the 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 44) Nea Peramos. Excavations continued; pottery found dates from the 7th Ct BC to HL, followed by scanty R and Byz.

They seem to have been originally used for storage, or as part of some workshop. The city flourished at the end of the 6th Ct BC, but was destroyed early in the 5th Ct. The pits are full of debris from this destruction. (ADelt 44 and 45) Petropege. O. Ekroll and S. Sande report: "The work of the Norwegian Institute was directed primarily towards establishing the shape and dimensions of the central building, probably a guest house or hani, inside the fortifica- tions. It is now clear that it extended across the entire inner courtyard from E to W, dividing it in two. The building is abnormally narrow (2.40m) compared with its length, and other indications also suggest that only the S part of a three-aisled building has been uncovered. The NW gate of the fortification was investigated, and proved to be almost exactly similar to the SE gate, having the same two phases of construction. It was later walled up, probably when the hani was built. Little was found at the NW gate, while inside and S of the hani, finds were mostly stray and of little value-some Ott coins and sherds of 13-14 Ct glazed Byz pottery." Philippoi. Dr A.G. Poulter directed the Macedonia Research Programme which included a geophysical survey within the ancient city of Philippi at the invitation of Professor G. Gounaris (University of Thessalonike): "A resistivity survey was carried out on the SE side of the ancient city. Immediately S of Professor Gounaris' excavations, high resistance anomalies appear to represent buildings and a paved road, continuing S and at right angles to the 'diagonal' road which runs from the Amphipolis gate NE to the Neapolis gate. A survey to the E found the continuation of the 'diagon- al' road and its junction with the Via Egnatia as well as buildings. Another probable road was identified running SE and at right angles to the Via Egnatia. It seems certain that the Via Egnatia follows the line of the modern highway and changed direction from its NW/SE alignment to head NE, leaving the city through the Neapolis gate. A survey S of the 'diagonal' road and extending as far as the southern defences suggested the presence of buildings, but also another paved road, this time orientated NW by SE, apparently therefore not respecting the alignment of the 'diagonal' road but possibly on the same alignment as the agora and the insulae excavated by Professor Gounaris. Analysis of the results may help to explain the curious use of two different street grids in the layout of the ancient city." Platania. Investigations of the acropolis, 2km W of the modern village showed that it was surrounded by a strong wall, like other sites of East Macedonia. The wall is 3m high on the SW side, and was altered on the E side during the Bulgarian occupation. Inside are the remains of many buildings: two excavated are dated to the 6th Ct AD. In another area the stratigraphy starts in the EIA, the period of the construction of the surrounding wall, but there then appears to be nothing before the 6th Ct AD. (ADelt 45) Serres. Substantial remains of a modest LByz secular building (bath house'?) were located between modern structures on Bosporou 16. (ADelt 44) Siderokastron. Excavations continued on the kastron. A basilica to the E, and associated burials, were investigated. Sherds from IA up to LByz were found, with the exception of the ECh period, when the site seems to have been abandoned. The Byz basilica was destroyed and replaced in the 13th-14th Ct. with a cemetery. The E end was perhaps transformed into a funerary chapel; burials end at the beginning of the Ott period. (ADelt 44) Skala Soteros. Excavation continued in 1989 and 1990 of the PR settlement. There is an ECh settlement on the N side of the hill, and underneath this confused levels with pottery of the 6th to 4th Ct BC. Here there is no PR material; either the settle- ment did not extend into this area or the traces of it were removed during the ECh construction. On the W side of the hill two walls of the 6th to 4th Ct BC stopped the erosion of the PR remains. Here the ceramic material dates to the last phase of occupation during the EH period. Finds of the older phase, outside the peribolos wall, include the head of an anthropomorphic marble figure. Further fragments of anthropo- morphic stelai were found in 1990. (ADelt 44 and 45) Stathmos Angistas. The Macedonian tomb was conserved. Excavations in the cemetery of this unknown city revealed graves dating from PR into historic times, probably to the end of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 44) Thasos. At the Karakatsani plot the remains of a large struc- ture were excavated in 1989. Two phases were identified but have not yet been dated because the take-over by the Demos of Thasos of the Kalogerikou building which houses the storerooms of the excavations has made access to the material difficult. During excavations on the site of the new wing for the Thasos museum, part of a street with a central drain dating to the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC was found. During the C to R periods there were buildings to either side of the street, but it was blocked off in the LR period. On the NE side, building dates to the time of the drain, with an older 5th Ct phase. On the SW side buildings are 4th Ct and HL.

(ADelt 44) In 199(). at the I. Niapou plot, levels going down to the 7th Ct BC were found 80m inside the city wall. A building of reused material, and a street with a drain leading to the Silenos gate, are dated to the 4th Ct BC. with later R building. At the Workers Settlement, digging for a drain revealed eight C graves. carefully built of tmarble slabs. All had been robbed. (ADelt 45) On the ramlparts, Y. Grandjean and F. Salviat report: "In 1995 investigation of the line of the ramparts was continued in the sector between the Med tort and the theatre. The section of the wall between the tort and the chapel of Agios Elias has almost entirely disappeared except for a short fragment, some Sm in length, which was reused in the Med period in the glacis constructed in firont of the fort. Neverthe- less it is possible to define the line of the rampart up to the neighbourhood of the chapel by means of the discontinuous traces left on the rock by the foundations of the wall. S of the chapel, up to the theatre, seven restricted soundings were taken which revealed remains of the wall, here a bit better preserved because of a natural overburden which had concealed the lower courses from the Med demolishers. These various investiga- tions have made it possible to recognise the line of the rampart in a sector in which previously it was not known. The appear- ance, not tar from the theatre, of a redan which performled the function of a tower, reveals a defensive system infrequently employed in the walls of Thasos. Parts of the road system associated with the walls have also been revealed: a street, cut in the rock, which ran along the inside of the wall and. joining this, at least two other roads whose beginnings have been uncovered and which lead to the centre of the town. A whole system of quarries was found several metres from the interior face of the wall from which the material for its construction was taken. The resulting levels and terraces are interesting for the arrangement and exploitation of urban space in this area." Archaeological Museum site. Remains of two LR-ECh building complexes divided by a road were discovered on the museum site, which has dates ranging froln 3rd-2nd Ct BC to the 5th Ct AD. with a destruction level in the middle of the 4th Ct. The road, which originally had led from the acropolis to the harbour, had become a dirt track by the last phase. Pottery and coins fi-om all phases were found. (ADelt 44) ADelt 45 reports the drawing up of a detailed historical mnap of Byz Thasos. Some information is given on located sites. Harbour. The Ephorate for Underwater Archaeology reports on work at the harbour, in collaboration with the French School. With the aid of pumps, a further section of the 5th Ct BC wall was cleared. Another wall was found parallel to the 5th Ct wall. Further work is needed to establish its purpose: it is tentatively suggested that it might be part of an ancient ship- shed. By the red harbour light the torso of a R female statue was found. In another trench, more of the ECh harbour wall was uncovered, together with a considerable quantity of pottery, mainly from amphoras of the 4th to 7th Ct AD. (ADelt 45) Chioni. A short excavation, undertaken jointly by Y. Garlon (French School) and Mrs Karadima-Matsas of the Komotini Ephorate, produced evidence for the production of amphoras at Chioni, situated at an altitude of 150-200m and 2.8km SE of Kato Prinos. They report: "Part of a rubbish dump (Fig. 8) which spread along the edge of a ravine was investigated in a series of soundings (Fig. 9) which produced the same type of material that had been found previously at Koukos, Vamvouri Ammoudia, Kalonero, Keramidi and Kounophia: that is, apart from some fragments Fig. 8 Fit. 9 Z-. of bg fine ware and pithoi abandoned by the inhabitants, a large quantity of coarse ware and tiles and above all a huge mass of amphora fiagments the vast majority of which had without doubt been manufactured on the spot, despite the rarity of overfired and misshapen fragments. Eleven tile stamps were found, as well as 486 amphora stamps: 430 of these have been identified. Excluding a gem-stamp, two non-lettered stamps on tiles and a stamp probably of external origin, the stamps are divided unequally between 95 types which give 82 names (implying that some isolated types come firom different workshops). The oldest names are those which appearl equally among the first at the workshop of Koukos, around 320 BC. If one takes into account that some names are probably missing by chance, it would seem that the Chioni workshop continued in operation util about 220 BC. Detailed study of the stamps, in conjunction with the period of operation, should make it possible to establish a precise chronology for the names of the middle and third quarter of the 3rd Ct, which until now has been extremely fluid. This will be helped by the stratigraphy, both vertical and horizontal, of the dump, which through the decades moved further to the E. By comparing the number of amphora bases and stamps it appears that all the 'recent' amphoras produced at Chioni were stamped, just as at Kouno- phia. Although no complete example was found, one can trace the development of the lip (from triangular to more rounded profile) and of the bases (first with a long sleeve, like the</page><page sequence="32">32 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 10 biconical amphoras, then increasingly like faired bobbins in more bellying amphoras, and finally like a button which links to a tapering belly without a break. Some 50m SW of the main excavation a small dump was found (Fig. 10) which produced 50 ancient stamps of exceptional interest; they belong to only five types, of which four mention the potter Skymnos with three names (Amyntor, Archestratos and Lageras) who thus find themselves grouped at exactly that moment when, at Kalonero, Aristagoras gave place to his son Demalkes, ca 350- 345 BC. All this leads us to believe that, as a consequence, the workshop at Chioni ceased to function for a quarter of a century, up till the opening of the new dump." Limenaria. The press reported the excavation by the Ephorate since 1993 of a N settlement. Tsines. The press reported what is described as the oldest quarry in Greece, for ochre, of Pal date, ca 20,0()0 BC. It contained antlers and stone tools. THRACE (19th Ephorate) No reports from this Ephorate are included in either ADelt 44 or ADelt 45. Didymoteichon. The press reported the discovery of two unique Macedonian tombs, not like other examples, at Regio. They are built of large slabs, with dromoi, and flat slab roofs over all. A third tomb contained a cremation, with a coin of Augustus. Pottery in the make-up of the toumba comes from an 8th Ct BC settlement. Work done along the walls of the kastron identified water- collecting systems and cisterns, storage areas and traces of a LByz settlement. (ADelt 44 and 45) Mesembria. The press reported the excavation of a large rectangular building, with a road 2-3m wide close to its wall. It dates between 530 and 350 BC. Nipsa (Ebros). The press reported the discovery of Thracian open-air cult places, including altars, of the 10th and 8th Cts BC. Philippi. Further excavations and investigations were made at the Museum basilica: of a N ancillary structure (belonging to the first ECh phase), of the stratigraphy of the SE corner of the great hall of the baptistry (destruction and flooding layers), and of the spiral staircase which appears to have communicated with the gallery from the S. (ADelt 44) Excavations are reported of part of the Via Egnatia and two ECh buildings, found under the area proposed for the museum parking lot. (ADelt 45) Samothrace. J. McCredie reports on work carried out in 1995 in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods in 1995 by the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University for the ASCS: "Further investigations of the S and E foundations of the Hall of Dancing Maidens (the former 'temenos') showed that their anomalies resulted not from the existence of earlier buildings or monuments on this site, but rather from the manner in which the foundations were constructed. Only the centre portion of the door wall, built of tan porous sandstone laid in regular courses, and four blocks of the median wall, of the same material, appear to be remnants of an earlier building. Lacking as it does any undisturbed earth, its date cannot now be determined. The rest of the foundation was built of reused sandstone, conglomerate and limestone; this was laid, except at the SE corner, on a sub-foundation of large polygonal field- stones. This in turn was laid on bedrock. At the N, it formed a strong terrace wall to retain the massive stone and earth filling that was necessary owing to deep gullies in the bedrock. The N end was framed, both inside and out, by cut stone foundations, porous sandstone on the outside and various reused materials on the inside. Although evidence is lacking, it seems likely that cut stone also capped the N sub-foundation, so that a single, strong foundation supported the steps and colonnades of the entrance porch. On the W the sub-foundation was also capped by cut stone. The lowest course is of the same tan porous sandstone as the earlier building, which was probably its source. That the blocks are reused is shown by the fact that most were higher than required, and were dressed down to receive the succeeding course. That course is pre- served only in two blocks at the SW corner. They are clamped, as are others at the same level in the S and E foundations. The section drawn by the Austrian expedition shows, however, that this was not the top course of the foundation, but that one more stood on it to support the euthynteria. Most of the E foundation was similarly built, but the materials are different, consisting of grey porous sandstone and fine limestone (the latter the same used in the 5th Ct round structure opposite the Propylon of Ptolemy II). At the SE corner, bedrock rose higher and no subfoundation was necessary. Instead, the bedrock had to be cut to accommodate the foundations, and where a rock face resulted the builders widened the foundation to rest against it. Here the variety of materials and the evidence (from clamps and dowels) of their reuse is even greater. The plan of the building, which consisted of two long rooms, each fronted by a projecting wing of the porch, is now clear. To judge from the Austrians' evidence, the W room was lower than the E and provided with an eschara and bothroi, successors to earlier cult installations on its site. There is no evidence of earlier activity in the preserved portion of the E room. The foundation for the deep porch which lay between the columns of the facade and the door-wall consisted of a packing of fieldstones and earth. It contained pottery of the 5th and 6th Cts BC which, together with the bones of the sacrificial victims, give evidence of earlier cult activity. It is not clear, however, whether that activity took place on the site of the porch or elsewhere. Fallen portions of the retaining wall at the S of the Hall of Dancing Maidens were removed, and the earth behind them investigated. The latter consisted of debris that had fallen along with the walls, and of the wall fill. Additional fragments of the marble superstructure of the Hall were recovered, including fragments of the floral acroterion, of antefix kalypters, of the</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 sculptured friezes and of other architectural members. A coin of Gallienus puts the destruction in the 3rd Ct AD or later.

NORTH EAST AEGEAN ISLANDS (20th Ephorate) Chios: town. At Frankomagoula, excavation continued on the Kourtesi plot. Beneath the HL building found in 1988, an A and a PG pithos burial were found, while at the Frankaki plot graves were found belonging to the HL cemetery. Trenching for water and sewage works also uncovered parts of the HL cemetery in the following streets: Odoi Lamianou, Favierou, Kountouriotou, Patera and Kanellaki. (ADelt 44) In the following year, a dedicatory insciption by the Gerousia to Hadrian was found in Odos Vlatarias. (ADelt 45) At Agios Iakovos, on the Loutrari plot, columns and walls found in 1989 belong to the ancient agora of the city. Two monumental buildings were identified here in the following year, together with part of another building of either LA or EC date, and the remains of HL and R buildings. With the public buildings was a deposit of significant HL and ER sculpture, particularly of deities. (ADelt 44 and 45) At Tambakika, at the Pouli plot walls of large stone and reused material are dated to the 6th-7th Ct AD, and, below this, a R building on HL foundations. (ADelt 44) Lemnos. At Myrina, in the Tsas district, remains of two building phases, the first EA, the second HL were found on the Sophra plot in 1989. Further excavations the following year revealed an EA building, and over it part of a HL potter's workshop, in which were Megarian bowls with mythological and plant decoration. Similar remains were observed on the plot opposite, where excavation was to be continued. (ADelt 44 and 45) On the plot of the Technical School, part of a cemetery with late HL and R graves was found in 1989, and at Richa Nera, the Karavia-Lampadaria plot, EH buildings of the 3rd and 4th Poliochni phases. (ADelt 44) At Maitana, at the Kalantzi plot, a stone sarcophagus containing five identical Attic lekythoi of 460-450 was found, and at Tyrokomeio, at the Pateraki plot, an HL grave and finds of C and A.

The press reported the discovery on this small island in the bay of Mydros of a PR settlement, partly dis- turbed as a result of the activities of the military during the First World War. Walls and floors are attributed to the Poliochni 'yellow' period, 2300-2000 BC. Lesbos. At Kamaris, the hill of the anc. theatre, excavations in 1989 produced the remains of a ceramic and coroplast's workshop. At Epano Skalas, on the Veneta plot, PByz building remains, and pottery from the Ott baths opposite, were found to come over an earlier building incorporating a reused marble stele inscribed: OPOZ / YYQT / IAcA / OA / MHTPOA /ATAO. Beneath this building is a level rich in late HL pottery. (ADelt 44) Continued excavation in 1990 produced evidence for a public building, probably a stoa, with four courses of isodomic masonry preserved. It is slightly trapezoidal in plan, and HL in date; it is identified as part of the agora. (ADelt 45) At the House of Halim Bey, part of the drainage system of the ancient city was found in 1989, and in 1990 building remains of two periods, the upper dated to late antiquity, the earlier to LHL, but all this hade been confused by the more recent building. (ADelt 45) At the Sourlanga plot the excavation of the LR building was completed. A small hoard of eight bronze coins of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD was found. Conservation of a neoclassical house in the district of the Metropolis on the Zoumpadelli plot revealed the E wall of a monumental building, with eight courses of pseudoisodomic masonry in marble preserved. Built into the lower part of this, as resued material, was a R honorific inscription: ABOAAAKAIOAAMOI /ETEIMAE1EE_T- ONHOM/nHIONOYAAANMAPKIANO/TAMIANAHMAP- XONITPATH/DON AAMQPQMAQN FIAII/TAIIA IE XEKA/ENOX. (ADelt 44) At Mitylene town parts of the cemetery were excavated at the Paradelli plot (graves of the 2nd Ct BC) and the Choriatelli plot. Another cemetery was found in the region of the airport, at the Politi plot 8km from the city. (ADelt 44) At Pyrgos Thermis, on the Agiassoti plot are the remains of EH houses under a destruction level. Methymna. At the Mygia plot, excavation of part of the HL cemetery continued in 1989, when 17 graves were cleared, including three more R, and a pot burial of a child. These were on top of earlier building levels, part of a paved N-S street with an apsidal building to the W and another building to the E. Below this is an LG level. To this, or to earlier levels, belong the remains of three circular structures. At the Demetr- iou-Stavraki plot a N-S road was found, and, on top of it, a building with 'pseudo-Lesbian' masonry. (ADelt 44) In the following year, on the Koutou plot, a wall with deposits going back to HL was uncovered, and Byz remains on the Delevi- Ziampora plot. (ADelt 45) Skala Eresou. At Aphentelli, on the plot of the Koularas Co., part of a rural road was found, 2.10-2.55m wide and paved with local cobbles. A stretch of some 20m was excavated. It appears to have been in use from A to ER times. (ADelt 45) CYCLADES AND SAMOS (21st Ephorate) Delos: Agora of the Competaliastai. Claire Hasenohr (French School) reports on excavations designed to investigate the earlier stages of the area: "Trench 1, at the NW corner of the Square Monument, produced evidence that this was given shallow foundations in a fill on average 45cm thick, with much pottery. Below this was a layer of very pure silt, grey in colour and from 3 to 15 cm thick, extending over the entire area of the trench, and in some places covering fragments of waterlogged timber and rocks of granite and gneiss set in sand mixed with water- abraded sherds. Excavation continued down between the rocks encountered only sand (Fig. 11). It is probable that this lower level represents a beach, while the timber represents human improvement (planking'?). The rocks are certainly a continu- ation of those discovered by Vallois, but their irregular positioning means they cannot have been placed on purpose to define the shore. Sample analysis should determine the origin of the silt, whether it indicates a rise in sea-level (which would explain the deposit of fill before placing the paving), or an accumulation of water behind a border to the shore, which made the area marshy. Two other trenches were opened to 33</page><page sequence="34">34 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 12 Fig. 11 either side of the facade wall of the W shops (Figs. 12 and 13). The principal interest of these has been the demonstration of a first phase before the predecessors of the shops existed. Granite slabs were found which once carried a line of columns.g. 13 The importance of this foundation suggests a carrying forward of the floor, in a manner common at Delos (colonnade streets). This portico was then walled up when each shop occupied a section of the facade. In addition, the Square Monument and the Tholos were partly dismantled, consolidated and reas- sembled (Fig. 14)." Archegesion. Cleaning work was carried out at the Arche- gesion under the direction of F. Prost. Scattered marble blocks were collected and numbered along the E and S sides of the Temple of Anios, in prepation for an architectural study of the complex of the Anios sanctuary. Sanctuary of Apollo. A. Farnoux (French School) reports: "A grid of 5m squares was laid out, the first line across the peribolos wall and then in a succession of lines up to the 'Monument of the Bulls', with square Al at the NE. This is an area of previous excavations and is often covered with the debris from these (particularly those of Bizard in 1905) which had to be removed before excavation of untouched levels. A series of squares was opened along row 4 (H, I, J, K, and L) and across row L (1, 2, 3 and 5 as well as L4). These showed that the course of the Inopos originally passed through this Fig. 14 area, and revealed natural deposits resulting from it which created marshy conditions before the depositing of a layer of compact stone, and a surface from improvement work which Vallois associated with the construction of the Monument of</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 Fig. 15 Fig. 16 the Bulls. A pit in J4 produced metal objects, glass and large quantities of abraded pottery, as well as a bronze lion, figurines (one a small doll with articulated arms). It is likely that this constitutes the debris from a house destroyed in 88 or 69 BC, perhaps situated to the E. Other material indicates that the area served as a rubbish dump on several occasions. The excavations in row L, against the peribolos wall, revealed its foundations, six or seven courses of gneiss coated in white, in sharp contrast to the granite superstructure. Even if the gneiss courses are the result of modern restoration, the wall was constructed partly on the bedrock, partly on a rubbish pit containing amphora and other ceramic material which would seem to be not earlier than the 2nd Ct BC, but this remains to be confirmed. The wall is at present dated with the construction in 250 BC of the Stoa of Antigonos to its N. Rock-cut pits found in L4, similar to those found further E by the Altar of Zeus Polieus indicate a cemetery which had been 'purified'. These excavations show that this region never included an alsos, for which there is neither archaeological nor epigraphic evidence. The late development of the area is undoubtedly due to the Inopos. The most notable feature, (and one not remarked by the earlier excavators) is the large number of rubbish pits of the HL period. Even if the date for the peribolos, ca 250 BC, is correct, it is clear that the Delians continued to use the bed of the Inopos, or what was left of it, as a rubbish dump right up to the 1st or 2nd destruction in the 1st Ct BC, a fact which sheds new light on the inscription found in 1926 near the Altar of Dionysos, which prohibited the depositing of rubbish and ashes in the Temenos of Leto and the terrain of Dionysos." Serapeia. Work was carried out under the direction of Helene Siard (French School), to confirm various hypotheses proposed by P. Roussel and to clear the area to complete its planning: "A trench in Serapeion B (Fig. 15) revealed a deep level of fill, with much material in it, in which there were also two worked blocks of marble. These are associated with walling. It was shown that there was not a staircase here, and that the blocks and walling resemble another structure in the opposite corner of the courtyard. They represent quadrangular spaces set aside from the rest of the court, with a pit containing ash and bone, indicating their function. Further cleaning included the crypt (Fig. 16), the bench along the E bank of the Inopos which gave access to the corridor of the sanctuary, and the Fig. 17 "chapels' a, b, and c of room G. Cleaning the crypt revealed that its floor was constructed from a layer of tile and hydraulic cement (Fig. 17). No conduit was found connected to or from this, and it appears therefore that it was not used to contain water permanently, but that water was brought to it from outside. In Serapeion A, work was carried out to examine the S bank of the Inopos, where the wall was found to be of similar construction to the peribolos of the sanctuary. This work proves that originally the sanctuary extended along the S bank of the Inopos. Cleaning of the Inopos itself established the existence of an earlier channel beneath the one visible at present. The early bed, in its centre, was paved with slabs of gneiss, the intervening gaps filled with hydraulic cement and small stones. It runs sometimes under the centre of the present channel, sometimes more to the N as it approaches the lower reservoir. The width of the channel was variable, to control the rate of flow. The whole seems to have been covered with slabs, over which the later channel was constructed." 35</page><page sequence="36">36 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 18 Fig. 19 Theatre. Ph. Frasse and J.-Ch. Moretti (French School) report on cleaning and restoration work: "In the cavea the two northernmost kerkides have been cleaned and the displaced blocks over their surface (more than 200) have been catalogued. Attempts to trace connections between these and blocks still in place have proved fruitless. The fragments of the architrave and cornice of the monumental gate which stood at the top of the ramp leading to the S end of the diazoma have been reassembled on wooden beams below the Hostelry (GD 113). Eight fragments make up a double- faced doric architrave, .407m high by 3.555m long and .487m wide (Fig. 18). Both faces have five regulae each with six guttae. The soffit is decorated with a smooth hollow. The cornice is of Ionic type, with a claw moulding at the base, a top section with hollowed edge, and a face topped by an ovolo (Fig. 19). It is made up of two slabs, of which seven pieces have been identified. It seems likely that the cornice rested directly over the architrave without an intervening frieze. The theatre cistern once carried a series of two-piece well heads in marble, fixed by four flat dowels to slabs of the same material. Two slabs which-are almost complete and two more fragmen- tary ones have been reassembled. Of the 14 half well heads preserved, only two still have the clamps which join them together. Study of the cuttings for the clamps has made it possible to reassemble six other well heads. All these pieces have been placed near the cistern (Fig. 20)." Kythnos. In the Ergon of AS for 1995 A. Mazarakis-Ainian reports the results of his research to date: "The ancient city of Kythnos (modern Vryokastro) is on the NW coast of the island. The walled zone encloses almost 285 stremmata together with a small island which in antiquity was probably joined to the mainland but was separated by a change in sea level. From the ancient cemetery, fragments of grave reliefs and inscribed A and HL stelai were collected. Particul- arly important is a burial marker of the mid-7th Ct BC, which bears the earliest A inscription in the Dorian dialect known from the island. On the basis of masonry style, the city-wall, towers and bastions date to the C-EHL period. Some sectors in the upper city date to the A period. The succession of triangu- lar towers-preserved in an impressive condition-of the wall's N branch is unique in Greece. To the SE of the city lay the ruins of a small fortified citadel, possibly the headquarters of the Macedonian garrison established on Kythnos by Philip V in 201 BC (Livy XXXI,15). On the summit of the acropolis hill is a sanctuary which functioned from the 8th Ct BC to the st Ct AD; surface finds imply that it was dedicated to the cult of Demeter Thesmophoros. At a lower level are two monumental rectangular buildings, supported by substantial terrace walls and dated to the 4th-3rd Ct BC. That to the S consists of two rooms opening to the E as a stoa (17 x 11.60m). Next to the stylobate is an under- ground rock-cut cistern, a ruined semi-circular exedra and the foundations of an altar (9 x 3m) of dressed ashlars surrounding a rocky projection of the ground. The N edifice is larger (20m long). A cult function for it is supported by an inscription (IG XII 5,1057) and by piece of a marble sculpture which P. Themelis assigns to a colossal statue of Aphrodite Anadyo- mene, by the Messenian sculptor Damophon, of the 2nd BC. A statue base of the 4th BC, found near the harbour, inscribed with the name of Aphrodite, confirms that she was worshipped on Kythnos. A paved street led to the harbour. More than 25 rainwater cisterns have been found. The city had a water supply brought underground from the spring at Trypio which is outside it: three parallel tunnels are preserved, cut in the rock, and a fourth one cuts through them transversly. The oldest surface finds date to PG; the city was abandoned in the 6th Ct AD, when the inhabitants moved into the fortified settlement of the Kastro, on the N coast of the island."</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 Ten sealstones depict chariots, bull-games and heraldic griffins. They were found at a slight distance from the ceiling, so were probably in a pyxis or bag that either was hanging from it or floated in as a result of the innundation. In Xeste 4, the Large Staircase-decorated with frescoes showing a men's procession--was investigated. Large chunks of plaster with painted pictures suggest continuation of the flight up to the second storey. Additionally, another flight would lead from the ground-floor to the first storey. The whole stairway was flanked by frescoes. With the clearing operations on Koureton Street, the S face of Xeste 4 was revealed. This street is grandiose, both in terms of width and the buildings that line it (I, Xeste 4, ID, IB). Its surface is made of trodden soil. The destruction stratum in this area comprises dressed blocks of stone, which originally cased the facade of the West wall of Xeste 4. By the depth of earthfill near the lintel of the main entrance, it is possible to deduce the steep inclination of Koureton Street towards the East." Fi. 2() Mykonos. The press reported the discovery at Phtelia of a N settlement. dating between 5.()() and 4,()0()00 BC. Paros. At the Kyriazanou plot. E of the Katapoliani. excava- tions in 1989 produced HL and R sherds, and a grave lined with reused marble, including stele bases, one with the inscription EIMOE in 4th BC letters. At Paroikia in 199(), excavation was resumed at the cemetery of the ancient city. beginning to the S. outside the graves of the 7th and 6th Cts BC. Here graves of the 5th and 4th Ct began to be tound, including two tomb memorials, with built bases to contain the ash urn, and a stele on top. One of these was inscribed: NIKQ. At the W part of the cemnetery two sarcophagi were found, one---of the 3rd Ct AD-inscribed: AXIAAEYZ AXIAAEQIZ. Rescue excavations at the neighbouring Theocharides plot produced two marble sarcophagi and two marble bases. One sarcophagus was decorated with the representation of a funerary banquet. These excavations were continued with funds provided by the landowners, and several inscribed small columns and altars were found-one with the inscription: HAPMENOYZA . Also in 1990, the city wall was traced at its E side, built with two rows of marble slabs, often 2m in length. There is a gate at the NE side, NW of the monastery of Agios Eustathios and 5m S of this is a square tower (7.5 x 7.3m) in isodomic masonry and bonded into the E face of the wall. (ADelt 44 and 45) The press reported the discovery in 1995 of a marble stele with the relief of a woman from the late HL-early R cemetery. Siphnos. The Ephorate for Underwater Archaeology reports the excavation of a wreck off the small island of Kitriani, off the SE coast of Siphnos. Its cargo of amphoras (of the type Lambroglio 2) date it to the late 2nd or early 1st Ct BC. (ADelt 45) Thera. Ch. Doumas reports on the work of the AS in Er-gon for 1995: "Room DI 8 of complex D is divided into two smaller ones by means of a wall. The roof has been preserved in situ; the trench was therefore cut vertically and the accumulated earth removed gradually while the ceiling was supported. Plaster of Paris was poured into the cavities left by decomposed objects of organic material. This reproduced the shape of pieces of furniture, a small oar and five wattled baskets. No pottery was recovered, apart from two large storage jars and a few cups. DODEKANESE AND AMORGOS (22nd Ephorate) lalysos. Excavations were completed in 1989 at the Lialmi plot, on the PR settlement. A paved street dated to LM IA was found covered with volcanic ash; it continued in use until LH IIIA. Building remains of the M city were found, dated LM IAI and more of LM IA2. The walls of buildings seem to have been used all through the period LM II to LH IIIA, with additions and alterations. Other walls similar in date range were found on other plots in the area. (ADelt 44) Similar results are reported in the following year, with MBA material from the Metaxotou plot: walls and a circular pit with burnt material and pottery. Also in 1990, at HL Ialysos. on the Aloupi plot, 4 kilns were found with circular chambers, arranged in a series. The first two contained lead, and were used for metallurgical processes. They were dated to the 1st 1/2 of the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 44 and 45) Kalymnos. Cleaning of the bronze statue found last year in the sea off Kalymnos has revealed that it is likely to be a HL original. Bathys. Rescue excavations were undertaken on an LR-ECh building and a three-aisled basilica (12.2( x 9.50m) previously located by Bean and Cook (BSA 52, 132). Pottery was found dating to the 4th-7th Ct. The basilica preserves the stylobate, carved into the rock, of a templon screen on the S aisle, an unusual feature. The sanctuary seems also to have been carved into the rock, and mosaics of fine quality (geometric motifs) cover much of the floor surface. Quite a number of renovations and phases are attested in both buildings. (ADelt 44) Kardamaina. Georgia Kokkorou-Aleura, Sophia Kalopsi-Verti and Maria Panagiotidi report in Ta Kotkci 5 on the excavation by the University of Athens at anc. Halasarna. The site, below the acropolis and near the church of Agia Theoteta, was discovered during construction of a hotel: rescue excavations were conducted by the Ephorate and the subsequent excava- tions by the University of Athens were briefly reported in AR 1993'-94 71. One building is tentatively identified as the temple of Apollo. However, several factors suggest that this may not be the temple: the known antiquity of the sanctuary, with earlier inscriptions, the existence of late HL pottery associated with the foundations and the use of grey and white marble, which show that it must date to the late HL period. Near it is 37</page><page sequence="38">38 R. A. TOMLINSON a stoa and a possible altar. The sanctuary seems to have suffered in the earthquake of AD 142 and was subsequently abandoned. After this much material was reused in buildings of a LR and ECh settlement, itself destroyed in the great earthquake of AD 554, followed by immediate reoccupation and reconstruction, with final destruction resulting from the Arab sea-raids of AD 654-5. Kos: town. Excavations at Odos Gregoriou V produced part of a house dated to R and ECh times, by the side of a N-S street. Early remains go back to the time of the synoikismos of 366 BC. Coins were found, along with stamped amphora handles of the 1st 1/2 of the 4th Ct BC showing that the Kos mint was in fact in operation then, that is, before the synoikismos. Part of the city wall was found in the Lagou plot. (ADelt 44) In 1990 at the Seraglio, excavations at the Koutsourali plot produced evidence for two 7th Ct BC buildings on top of a G cemetery. The first phase, of the mid 7th Ct, possibly included a well. In the second, dated to the last 1/4 of the 7th Ct, the well was filled. Below this are G graves set in a Myc stratum. These are mostly inhumation burials, but there are two cremations, indicating the introduction of the new burial rite. On the S part of the plot, a LM IA multiple doorway was found, part of a building destroyed by an earthquake at the end of LM IA. On the Saroukou plot, buildings of the M and Myc periods were found, with levels of A, CL, and Hl above. There are four PR levels, the lowest being MBA. In the same year, in the S part of the city, at the Tsocha plot, ancient roads were found which demonstrate an insula width of 33m. A N-S road has its E boundary on two levels, the earlier going back to the foundation of the city in the 4th Ct BC, when the road had a width of 8.80m. As the result of an ECh intrusion on its W side, it was narrowed to 4m. This road runs E of the agora. The E-W road continues along the S side of the agora and forms the main road linking the agora to the Asklepeion. This has a variable width: at the centre of the city, in an area of public building between the agora and the gymnasium, it has a width of 33m (similar to the Broad street of Alexandria). E of the agora, however, it is reduced to I I m. Buildings on the E side of the plot start with the foundation of the city in 365 BC. In the R period it contained one big house, comparable with the 'Casa Romana', with fine mosaic floors. At a lower level are the remains of a c potter's workshop. At Odos Gregoriou V, a large R house had floors of polychrome marble and mosaic around a peristyle courtyard. The room with the marble floor formed a triclinium open to the courtyard. Fragments of HL and R sculpture were found. In the cemetery, at the Kontovourou plot, HL and R graves were found includ- ing a monumental underground ChT. (ADelt 45) Remains of a large public building (700 sq.m investigated to date) were encountered on Ioannidou. The structure seems to have included a courtyard surrounded by a stoa opening onto rooms. Another stoa may have lay to the S. Marble and mosaic floors were found in other parts of the complex. Date of use is suggested as AD 1-3rd Ct with very little ECh presence. (ADelt 44 and 45) Airport. At the Kos Trophodosies Co. plot, 42 graves were excavated in 1989. (ADelt 44) Kremaste (Asomatos). At the Pabaka plot an EBA setlement with two megaron-plan buildings was found, with traces of earlier structures underneath. (ADelt 44) Leros. The church of the Panagia Gourlommata is reported at Drymon. An inscription and finds date it to 1327. The single- aisle structure was built on top of an earlier building. Fragmen- tary wall-paintings (not dated) are preserved within. (ADelt 45) Nisyros. At Mandraki, excavation at the OTE plot revealed walls associated with R pottery. These are in the area of the ancient harbour. (ADelt 44) Platani. A built grave with lamps of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD were found in the Giakaloglou plot, while trenching by the water- works company produced a series of graves of the I st Ct AD. (ADelt 45) Plemmyri (anc. Ixia). This sanctuary was investigated in 1990. There is a church on top of the site of the temple, which was probably that of Apollo Ixios. A surrounding fortification wall produced HL BG pottery. Graves in the vicinity were mostly robbed, but one contained pottery dated to the 1st 1/2 of the 3rd Ct BC. In addition there is a ChT with R coins (Antoninus Pius, Maximian and a Rhodian coin of the 1st Ct AD). (ADelt 45) Rhodes: Archangelo island. Excavations were carried out on the cruciform katholikon of the monastery Agios Nikolaos (mentioned in 15th Ct documents), whose enclosure walls are preserved. The many ECh architectural members found may point to an earlier basilica in the vicinity. (ADelt. 44 and 45) Arnitha. At the Hagia Eirene site, an extensive ECh complex with two basilicas, a baptistery and a martyrion was located. Rhodes town. Excavations in Rhodes town reported in ADelt 44 give more information about the fortifications of the city, its street arrangement and buildings, and the cemeteries, particularly those of the EHL period. Some of the information has been used already in other publications, but the details given are significant. Probably the most important is the identification of the gymnasium and its surrounding stoa in the area of Odos Agias Anastasias and Palaion Patron Germanou. This already appears in the city plan given in the 2nd edition of Hoepfner and Schwandner, Haus und Stadt im klassischen Griechenland (Abb. 41), where it is labelled Ptolemaion Gymnasion?, and is situated S of the agora, from which it is separated by one large block of the grid plan, bounded to E and W by streets P30 and P31. The surrounding stoa had the usual internal and external colonnades, the internal on a series of separate foundations, the outer on a stylobate. The inner colonnade is 4m from the outer wall, the outer colonnade 4m from the inner. Most of the finds from the excavations (stamped amphora handles, lamps and sherds) date to the 2nd Ct BC. An interesting section of the city defences was uncovered in Odos Steph. Kazouli, where there are signs of repairs in an area producing abundant 4th Ct pottery; these are attributed to the siege by Demetrios Poliorketes. In the W part of the modern town, at Odos P. Mela, is an area identified as a sanctuary. In this is an area used for the casting of bronze statues. Dedicatory inscriptions include those on one statue base which give the names of Philophron son of Archinomos, whose statue was the work of the Athenian Kallyades, son of Sthennis,and to the right of this a statue of Astymedes by two Athenian sculptors, sons of Phyromachos, one called Asklapon, the other name not surviving on the stone; Astymedes' patronymic is also missing. A third dedicatee mentioned on the base had a name ending -on. It is suggested that we have here three generations of an athletic, aristocratic family from Lindos: Philophron son of Archinomos; his son Astymedes son of Philophronos and his grandson Philophron son of Astymedeus. The sculptors are significant,</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 39 indicating three generations of a family: Phyromachos the elder, his sons, and his grandson Phyromachos the younger. This family is discussed in the entry in ADelt 44; fortunately, the inscription was discovered in time for its evidence to be included in B. Andreae's Phyromachos Probleme. (RM Erg. heft 31, 1990) ADelt 45 reports further discoveries relating to the city walls and the street plan. Particularly significant are the excavations in the W part of the modern city, at Odos Cheim- arras and Enoplon Dynameon, where a complete insula of the ancient city grid was precisely defined. This block is bounded by streets P26 and P26a to N and S, and by streets P10 and P13 to E and W. This gives a block measuring 92.85m N-S by 47.52m E-W. Streets PI 1 and P12 are narrower than the others, and may be later (P26a is 6.60m wide). The first occupation of the insula seems to have been a bronze working establishment. This was followed by a HL house, the courtyard of which was excavated. It is noticeable that the areas defined by the streets seem to have waited a long time after the city grid was laid out before they were developed in this part of the town. Both ADelt 44 and 45 record the tombs found in develop- ment work of building plots and the construction of drains in the outer areas of the modern city. These are mostly HL, and show that the earlier cemeteries which follow the founding of the synoicized city are, as one would expect, closest to the city wall, both on the E and the W sides. Extensive work continues on establishing the nature of the town between the Roman and Crusader periods. The town seems to have been divided into two sections: Kollakio to the N and the extensive town proper. (ADelt 44 and 45) Parts of the Kollakio wall have been identified, along with parts of the underwater harbour walls. An area around the site of the cathedral of the Knights, destroyed in 1856, was examined and fragments of the knights' tombstones from the nave of the church were found, along with other interesting Latin remains (architectural members, statues etc.) from the 14th-16th Ct. A destruction level, possibly from an earthquake in 515 AD, was located under the vaulted entrance to one of the Byz gates. (ADelt 45) South of a section of the Kollakio wall (Pekmetzi plot), Byz walls on Agisandrou (average height 5.71m) were found with fragmentary 12th Ct (?) Byz ecclesiastical wall-paintings. Pottery from this period included coarse, glazed and sgraffito ware. The confused stratigraphy included coins from the 2nd Ct BC up to Manuel II (d. 1180). In the same vicinity a small cruciform chapel was found, likewise with 12th Ct painting fragments. An inscription mentioning a certain Constantine Harmenopoulos is preserved, along with late Comnenian paintings, mostly of bishop and warrior saints; 11th and 12th Ct tombs were found under the chapel. Coins found associated with the church date from 970-1180. (ADelt 44 and 45) Information on the restoration programme undertaken by the Ministry of Culture, the Archaeological Receipts Fund and Rhodes Municipality is reported. (ADelt 44 and 45) Salakos. An ECh three-aisled basilica was discovered at the Palioklisia site (width of central aisle, 6.60m). The building dates from the end of the 5th or early 6th Ct with a 7th Ct destruction level. The surrounding area is littered with struc- tural remains, including a oil press. ECh tombs have also been found here in the past, along with remains of an HL/R tower. (ADelt 44 and 45) Theologos. Joint excavations of the Ephorate with the Univer- sity of Ioannina are reported in ADelt 44 and 45 at the sanctuary of Erethymian Apollo. An ECh cemetery was found here in an adjacent plot. Cleaning within the temple W wall produced CL BG pottery, some A and some PR. There is a layer of volcanic ash at a depth of 3.17m. Tilos. At Agios Antonios a grave was revealed by the action of a rough sea, with a coin of 655/7 AD and a skull. There are traces of other graves in the area, now eroded by the sea. (ADelt 45) CENTRAL CRETE (23rd Ephorate) Heraklion. At Kastelli Pediados, excavation continued in 1989 of the large neo-palatial building with a processional way along its S side. There is also post-palatial building, A and HL deposits and pottery, and part of a Venetian fort on the site: the interior face of a Byz-Venetian wall, whose fill contains LByz sherds. The neo-palatial building extends under the Venetian wall. The excavations revealed a storeroom with small pithoi, a hall with a multiple doorway, two wide rooms and part of a third. Part of an exterior wall with a large euthynteria was cleared, and this appears to be the main facade of the building. Material fallen from an upper floor shows that this complex was used as a place of cult, with ritual feasts and libations. The date and cause of the destruction are uncertain. There seems to be an older (but still neo-palatial) building underneath. (ADelt 44) In 1990, excavation was completed at the Papadaki plot. Here there are two main building phases, LR and ECh. The older phase includes a stoa along the S side; the first room behind this has a fine mosaic floor. It was destroyed in the earthquake of AD 365 and a series of rooms was then con- structed above it. (ADelt 45) The press reported the discovery of a R villa with five good mosaic pavements, in a plot adjacent to the Heraklion Museum, to be used for an extension. Also, in 1996, graves dating from LM to PG at the Venezeleion Hospital, together with a HL temple to Demeter and a large built vaulted tomb, and in the previous year, a grave of the 1 st Ct BC, containing three skeletons, together with gold objects, plus walls of a house and a cistern. Knossos. Recent work in the Central Palace Sanctuary area was undertaken by Dr Marina Panagiotaki with the assistance of Dr D. Evely. Dr Panagiotaki reports: In 1993 a previously unknown gypsum floor was found during cleaning in the narrow room N of the West Pillar Crypt, (Fig. 21) as well as the sounding where an earlier burnt Fig. 21</page><page sequence="40">40 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 22 gypsum floor was first discovered by Platon and Hutchinson in the East Pillar Crypt. Pithos fragments belonging to the East Pillar Crypt and the Great Pithos room were identified among those stored in the area and removed to the Stratigraphical Museum. Work in 1995 attempted to clarify the architectural history of the area. In the East Pillar Crypt (SW corner), the burnt gypsum slabs found by Platon and Hutchinson were partly exposed. They comprise five horizontal slabs and two vertical; the latter surround the two southernmost horizontal slabs on the E and N (Fig. 22). If interpreted as the remains of a floor, the vertical slabs, even supposing they were ground down to prevent tripping over them, are certainly a unique occurrence. It seems more feasible to suggest that they are the remains of one or more rectangular structures, like cists. The horizontal slabs could be the bases or the covers of the cists. This cannot be determined until one of the slabs is lifted and its relation to the vertical slabs is understood. Below all the horizontal slabs there is a thick layer of burnt material which is either the contents of the structure, destruction debris brought in from elsewhere or a destruction layer in situ. Pottery that Platon had collected from the burnt material was dated by him to the Old Palace period and by Hutchinson to MM IA; the foot of an egg-cup collected by us points to an MM IA date. Whether Pre- or Old Palace this structure is unique at Knossos; if cists, they are the earliest yet to be found in the Palace. The structure was partly destroyed later when a pit was opened by the Minoans to insert the vat to the W of the pillar. The few pottery fragments firom this pit (which was filled with chunks of kouskouras) could belong to the MM IIIB/LM IA transition (Warren's terminology, or post Evan's MM IIIB destruction). Two soundings in the vat room, one at the S part of its threshold, the other at the centre of the room, reached N layers almost immediately. The sounding at the centre of the room revealed a trench opened by the Minoans along the W side of the vats. This may have been the pit opened for the insertion Fig. 23</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 41 .... ................................:......perhaps unique, find is the stone bath plug with the remains of iron fittings for a chain and handle (Fig. 24).

A section of mudbrick wall belongs to Fig. 24 the same period, perhaps an indication of the nature of the city of Knossos at the period when the basilicas were constructed. Another find was a gemstone depicting Artemis Ephesia, flanked by the sun and moon and a pair of deer (Fig. 27). Area E. Exploration continued of the substantial superimposed 9..... ..... 2nd Ct walls in the area, though it was not possible to expose the north end of the block, which measures between 15 and 20m N- S. The floor associated with the lower, unmortared wall (prob- ably contemporary with the Villa Dionysos) was again only defined by a scatter of tiles, while that of the upper, concrete masonry wall was defined by a dump of mudbrick debris and the construction of a late wall, perhaps both of EC date. The opportunity was taken to excavate below the earth Fig. 25 of the vats themselves. The pottery fragments from inside the pit, from undisturbed layers, point again to Warren's MM IIIB/LM IA transition. Obviously this was a time of architec- tural alterations in the CPS area." Roman Knossos. K.A. Wardle reports on work in the field north of the Villa Ariadne, which was continued in three of the areas opened in 1993: "Area C (Fig. 23). The shallow deposits here allowed considerable extension of the area of the building complex discovered previously, so that ca 250m2 have now been exposed. The W and S limits of the insula have been defined (although the walls have been severely robbed) but the N and E limits remain beyond our trenches. It is likely that the insula measures at least 30 x 20m. Six further rooms and a possible courtyard were revealed which all confirm the presence of a bathing establishment on a scale which suggests private-or at I - least restricted-use, rather than a public utility. The hypocaust room discovered previously was fully excavated and found to be linked by flue passages to another to the E of it, while the presence of a third hypocaust room may be deduced from the fact that we have still not found the furnace chamber. To the N was a plunge bath approximately 3m square, originally marble-lined, with a clay drain leading away from its base to join the network running through the complex. An unusual, Fig. 26</page><page sequence="42">42 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 27 floors of all three R 'rooms' found so far, and to explore approximately 50 m2 of the MM deposits reached in a small area in 1993. The phases were identified. The upper, with undressed masonry walls founded on the natural kouskouras which delimits parts of two rooms, can be dated, (thanks to the Fig. 28 generous assistance of Sandy MacGillivray) to the MM IIA period, with many wheelmade conical cups. The lower phase was represented by a deep pit or cavity which had been partly lined with masonry to form a kind of basement, subsequently overbuilt by the wall of the northern room. This deposit, which was more or less homogeneous, was rich in pottery, with some vases lying intact at different levels of the fill. Over 60 vases or whole profiles were mended, and conform to the material from the 'west court basements' excavated by Evans in 1904 and defined by MacGillivray as transitional MM IB/IIA with very little wheelmade pottery. Other finds included large parts of three stone vases (Fig. 28) and an intact conch shell. Organic material included plant remains and animal bones. The eastern limit of this deposit lies outside the area, under ca 2m of R levels, and awaits excavation. In a separate trench to the north, there was no trace of the concrete masonry walls of the late 2nd Ct, but instead a 4th Ct cobbled street surface running N-S which had reused an unmortared 2nd Ct wall as its eastern limit (later robbed out). On the contemporary surface to the east was a fine architectural block of limestone with dentils and moulding. Area H: Clearance continued of the upper part of the massive 6m-high concrete masonry wall in the NE of the field (close to the Villa Dionysos) with the aim, if possible, of finding its N and S limits. Although a further 9m were cleared at the S end and 6 metres at the S end, to give a total length of over 30 m, neither corner has yet been reached. The distinctive line of vertical blocks at approx. 3.5m above floor level was traced throughout the northern section of the wall and suggests the level at which the springing for a concrete vaulted roof would have started. A test against the eastern face of the wall at the southern end revealed a semicircular brick- lined niche in the wall face, starting about 1.5m above floor level. Traces of the marble facing were again found together with another section of the wave crest mosaic first discovered in 1993. To our astonishment, a tile arch could be seen at floor level, implying a drain or conduit passing through the wall below the floor and indicating not natural bedrock to the west but archaeological deposits over 6m deep. There can be no doubt that this is the wall of a major public building, perhaps a bath house, facing onto the main road 30m to the east with (probably) the forum beyond." Kommos. J.W. and M.C. Shaw report: "Excavation in 1995 was limited so that attention could be invested in study and site conservation. All trenches were located within the two monumental ashlar civic buildings S of the E-W Minoan road. The larger is LM I building T (Fig. 29), palatial in style with four wings set about a central court, the original ensemble being some 6000 m2, larger than the palace at Kato Zakros but smaller than that at Phaistos. Upon T's E wing was set, during LM IIIA2, building P, composed of six huge galleries facing the seashore. We have interpreted them as being used for storage, particularly of ships during the winter months. The first trench was within the S stoa of building T. A sounding next to the S wall revealed that it rested upon an earlier and wider wall of MM IIB date. This belonged to a monumental Protopalatial precedessor to building T, dubbed AA, of which other walls have been found below later floors. It appears that AA's builders constructed a huge level platform, which they did by first building high walls and then filling the areas between with packed clay, rubble and stone. Unlike most M structures, where foundations are usually shallow, the floors of AA were at a high level, so that when LM building T was built many of the MM floors, as well as</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 Fig. 29 Fig. 30 the upper walls, were simply rased. In one small area within a stairwell, mendable LMM IIB vases mixed with MM III sherd material have been found, as well as remnants of plaster tables, but it must still be determined whether they represent a final, pre-T use of AA or evidence for the earlier use of T. After building T went out of use in LM IA, a large pottery kiln with a fire pit adjoining four sloping flues was constructed within the S Stoa. In 1995 the final flue was cleared, the locations of fallen pottery and debris within it being noted carefully. This kiln, found with pottery inside and surrounded by a large pottery dump containing wasters, constitutes an unusual M production centre, for in the past little pottery could be attributed to a specific kiln. A small area was also cleared below P's initial floor at the E end of building P's Gallery 2. While floors of T were found below some of P's floors, T's floors had been destroyed during building operations connected with building P. One of the constant problems in this area is that walls from different periods occur at almost the same level, resulting in the disturbance or even complete removal of earlier floors by later ones." Malia. Sylvie Muller reports on the fourth year of archaeologi- cal survey in the plain of Malia: "Work was concerned with the evidence for the organisation of the region round the palace, locating the secondary sites and all other traces of human activity. The area explored is clearly defined: the bay of Malia, bounded to the S by the slopes of Mt Selena, closed off W of Stalida by the ridge of Trapeza and E of Sissi by the massif of Anavlochos. The 200m contour was provisionally chosen as the S limit, encompassing an area of around 30km2 (excluding the area immediately around the palace, already propected in detail). Although evidence for all periods was taken into account, interest was concentrated on those represented in the palace and its city, that is, the entire BA. As a result, more than 50 areas were identified by pottery or architectural traces, mostly habitation sites. Among those of primary importance is the site of Ayios Dimitrios at Stalida, where the existence of a chapel has preserved an adjacent hillock from destruction. Material recovered here goes back to EM, but the majority comprises pottery of LM III as well as fragments of R glass and sigillata. Two 'double' sites present an example of relocation in the course of time. These are in the cultivated fields at the W exit of the village of Malia, where an Fig. 31 EM II settlement has produced Vassiliki ware, while an abundance of MM II-LM I material was discovered some 150m to the E (Figs. 30 and 31). The first of these sites has already been partly destroyed by recent building. Similarly, a field situated S of the National Road between Malia and the M palace, immediately E of the hotel Nikos, has produced a quantity of MM III-LM I pottery and walls of cyclopean masonry (Fig. 32), while several lines of stones, pottery and stone tools of MM date were found 250m to the W. In both cases the site was on the E side of a slight hill, sheltered from the prevailing wind. Most of the sites found are M. MM II is represented almost throughout, while LM I appears only in a small number of sites, mostly of quite large size, demonstrating that the phenomenon already observed in the plain of the Mesara is repeated in the plain of Malia, in contrast to the situation observed in the region of Vrokastro. The post-M period is represented mostly by LR sites and a fortified H site, all on the smaller hills, particularly in the basin of Stalida, but also at Darmaros on the S slopes of Arkovouno. This last site, at 43</page><page sequence="44">44 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 32 present occupied by a petrol station, also has important M remains. The results, even though only partial already make it possible to recognize a certain regularity in the location of habitation sites. It appears that there are three lines of sites, at an average distance of 1.5km, as far as one can judge from the present state of research, surrounding the plain of Malia. The first runs along the coast, the second borders the kambos, that is, the plain properly speaking, made up of terra rossa a dozen metres thick, just below the 20m contour, while the third is on the foothills of Selena, at an altitude of around 100-150m. The palace town of Malia is itself in the second series, a fact which distinguishes it from the sites along the beach. These observa- tions enable us to presume the existence of sites which have now disappeared, such as that which ought to be found in the vicinity of Agia Paraskeve between Malia and Stalida, on a hill with two summits now levelled and covered with a vast tennis court. For all the sites found it still remains to draw the architectural traces and to measure exactly the extent ant density of surface sherds. No systematic research has been carried out into the road network as yet, but it can be seen that the road discovered in 1989 E of Agia Barbara continues in the direction of Sissi for several hundred metres. In addition a second parallel route hasbeen discovered a short distance S of this, possibly an earlier stage. Other traces of a road meander E of the chapel of Agios Nikolaos, in the direction of Arkovouno, revealed by a double wall of dry stone partly destroyed by a gap in the slope of the hill. S of the village of Malia a Turkish kalderim, marked on modern maps, can still be followed for several kilometres in the direction of Mochlos. Only the lower section has been destroyed by modern building. Information obtained from villagers concerning the forms of agriculture which prevailed prior to 1950 shed light on an important aspect of the exploitation of the land. As the numerous terrace walls which extend over all the slopes demonstrate, in the areas today penetrable only with difficulty because of the scrub corn, olives and carobs were cultivated on the higher land around the plain, thanks to a network of rectangular cisterns constructed on the summits of the hills to allow for their irrigation. The kambos, further from the sources of water, was more difficult to exploit. M sherds, found in small numbers on most of the terraces, as well as a channel cut in the sandstone W of the village of Malia, lead one to think that the same system was practised in the BA. A cistern, cut in a fault of the rock near the chapel of Christ could date back to the M period. Finally, a dry stone ruin with a cistern cut in the rock has produced a threshold block with pivot hole which ought to date to LM, indicating the possible reuse of a M installation. Sandstone quarries have been found at several points along the coast: at Stalida, near the site of Agios Dimitrios; at Malia, between the chapels of Agia Pelasgia and Agia Metamorphosis; E of Malia, on the elevation of the Hotels Park and Sun Beach, immediately E of Agia Varvara and at the beach of Sissi campsite. The most important remains that at the modern harbour of Malia, N of the chapel of the Holy Spirit already noted in 1991. The outcrops of conglomer- ate situated between Agia Varvara and the Sissi campsite preserve numerous traces of the removal of blocks, doubtless used for the construction of the M road already mentioned. A quick visit to the M harbour of Agia Varvara NE of the palace of Malia, exploored in 1989, leads to the report of permanent damage caused by the construction of a beach intended for the clients of the Hotel Hellenic Palace. The disappearance of the great N-S side wall drawn in 1989 has brought about a rapid erosion of the soil it protected to the E. A natural stratigraphic section around 2m high, beaten by the waves, revealed a series of M levels in which a burnt destruction level sealed architec- tural remains of MM II. An oval-mouthed jar can be seen in situ, as well as other objects recently loosened only a few metres from the sunshades of the hotel. Unfortunately there can be no doubt that the winter months will accelerate the destruc- tion of this site which is directly linked to the organisation of the palace town of Malia." Phaistos. At the Kalochristianaki field on the S side of the palace hill, deep ploughing uncovered worked blocks. Excava- tion revealed a solidly-constructed well, part of the HL town. At Phalangari, after illicit digging, excavation found HL cremations and MM pottery, probably from a MM cemetery. At Alesandraki, trench digging disturbed MM and HL graves: part of a clay sarcophagus and LM IIIA-B pottery were found. At Kouses, conservation work was carried out at the tholos tomb excavated in 1978/9. Illicit digging here led to more excavation in areas previously not touched outside the tholos, producing MM pottery. Further away a rural building with well-built walls dating to MM-LM I, was found. At Poroi Ai Gianni Phaistos, on the Kapaidonaki plot, a tomb building dated late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC was found, with other graves, part of the cemetery of HL Phaistos. (ADelt 44) Pediades: Smari A SM/G megaron building was excavated, with its opisthodomos on top of a MM building. From the finds it appears to have been the house of the local ruler, abandoned in the 7th Ct BC. Building B, next to it, has</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 45 benches along neach side wall. Pottery here was LG, with a MM level underneath the building. The two phases of occupa- tion here, G and MM, correspond to the phases at the peak sanctuary of Profitis Ilias. (ADelt 44) Pyrgiotissa: Pitsidia. Excavation continued in 1989 and 1990 of the interesting M rural house. On the W side of the building, evidence was found for cult use, particularly in room VIII, while room XIX seems to have served as a ceramics workshop. Room XIV contained pottery and stone tools, and served as a storeroom, while rooms XI and XVII contained material fallen from an upper floor. The house seems to have been abandoned following an earthquake in LM IB, but more accurate dating awaits a full study of the finds. (ADelt 44 and 45) At Kophinas, excavation of the peak sanctuary uncovered the peribolos wall, which has on its E side a projection open to the interior. Abundant pottery was found, MM III-LM I, LM IIIC, PG, HL and ER. The earliest sherds are MM IIIB or A. There is a lot of LM IIIB, but least LM IA. There are few examples of SM and PG, but they are of good quality. Other finds include objects of gold, bronze and semi-precious stones, steatite seats and stone tables. To the N are buildings of LM IIIC and SubM, difficult of access. At the foot is a HL wall. (ADelt 45) EASTERN CRETE (24th Ephorate) Agios Nikolaos. At Stavros, excavations continued in 1989 and 1990 at the HL-ER cemetery. All the graves investigated had been robbed. Scattered mateial from built tombs was found, and much pottery, lamps etc, including a HL lamp of the Ephesos type. An inscribed tombstone found in 1990 read: AFAOOKAHX / AnOAAKQ[NJIOY / XAIPE. (ADelt 44 and 45) Chalasmeno. W. Coulson (ASCS) and M. Tsipopoulou continued their collaboration in 1995: "To date, portions of six buildings, one small tholos tomb and an upper settlement at Katalimata have been discovered. At the site itself, excavations took place in two areas (A and B) separated from each other by a rocky outcrop. In both areas, portions of three architectural units have been uncovered. The largest unit of area A consists of at least five rooms, one of which may have been used for domestic cult, since ash, burnt pottery, parts of a necklace and a bull figurine were found scattered over the floor. One of the vases, a kalathos, is paralleled so exactly in decoration and shape by another vessel from the tomb that it is likely both were painted by the same hand. The largest unit of area B consists of six rooms and a courtyard. Since the floors of the various rooms had been left largely undisturbed, the excavations here have yielded evidence for the function of the rooms and their relation to one another. At least one room was used for the preparation of food and another for consumption. In a third a tholos tomb, perhaps PG in date, had been constructed." Chrysokamino. Philip Betancourt reports on a geological survey and topographic mapping at Chrysokamino, N of the town of Kavousi, on the coast opposite the island of Pseira, E of Gournia and Pacheia Ammos and W of Tholos beach: "This consists of a metallurgical installation, M houses and a cave. In 1995 the team of geologists mapped the exposed bedrock. Their study indicates that geomorphology played an important role in the ancient use of the landscape here. Land use is directly related to the geology, topography and types of soils, and the different micro-systems seem to have been used Fig. 33 in different ways. The terrace wall system is on hillsides covered with a phyllitic soil, formed from decomposed phyllite. The metallurgical location, on a headland above the coast, is a spot where winds are almost constant, but where access to the sea is possible. The nearby habitation is constructed on exposed outcrops of harder dolomite that offers a more secure foundation for architecture than the phyllite. The parts of the hillsides where the bedrock is dolomite do not have terraces, and their use must have been very different from that of the terraced land, perhaps offering the estate grazing lands." Gournia project. L.V. Watrous reports on the 1995 study season: "It was discovered that the EM I-II coastal site of Halepa (at the E end of the Bay of Pacheia Ammos) was much larger than originally estimated. This archaeological site extends from the crossroad of the Kavousi-Ierapetra roads to the N of the unfinished church of Agia Photini. EM houses visible along the coast are currently being eroded by the sea. This site, which produced hundreds of pieces of obsidian, is the largest EM I-II settlement in the Isthmus of lerapetra. It deserves to be protected and is worthy of investigation and excavation." Itanos. (French School and Polytechnic of Crete): "In 1995 cleaning work was carried out in three areas at the ECh church: (i) the HL terrace, where other walls were revealed, also probably terraces made necessary by the collapse of the HL wall; (ii) in the area N of the church, revealing</page><page sequence="46">46 R. A. TOMLINSON Fig. 34 Fig. 35 buildings of poorer construction, but with which the church was associated; (iii) E of the church, where there are indica- tions that it had an exonarthex. In zone 2 (Fig. 33), the area of habitation excavated in 1950 by Gallet de Santerre was cleaned and planned. Modern deposit was removed to rediscover the level reached by the 1950 excavations, while the area E and S was studied to verify the stratigraphy and to establish the chronology. The lowest levels are below the present water table.The earliest above it com- prises a road, possibly related to a wall and paving. It seems to be a major link between the two acropoleis and dates probably to the beginning of HL. The road network was considerably modified following the construction of a building dating to the turn of the st Cts BC and AD. This was followed by another change resulting from the construction of a monument at right angles to this building. The final occupation (5-6th Ct AD) was marked by a house at right angles to the previous monument. Aerial photography had suggested the existence of a harbour in the area to the S of the acropoleis and N of the large hill. Geophysical investigations suggested a difference between two basins separated by a wall, but excavation showed that this was due to modern agricultural drainage work. Further geophysical research is being carried out; trenching has so far revealed no trace of marine influence. Geophysical research was also carried out at the extension of the HL rampart encircling the large hill at the point where it disappears into the plain (Fig. 34). Excava- tions to explain detected anomalies found only a succesion of alluvial levels with scanty, badly abraded pottery. In the N necropolis, excavated by Gallet de Santerre, the 'Grand Tomb' (Fig. 35) was cleaned and investigated. This is a unified structure ca 18m in length, with tripartite internal division. Two separate burial areas each have their own entrances. To the S are compartments built from ammouda orthostats which would have contained the funerary receptacles, while to the N inhumations were made in a vault under a paving of grey limestone. The third space, to the N, had no entrance, and no burial structure. A course of blocks probably constituted a base for a statue or stele. Like the other divisions it was unroofed. A survey was carried out in the territory of the city, leading to the discovery of a large number of agricultural establish- ments in particular, but also of other structures whose date and function cannot as yet be determined. Near Travouni a large number of varied structures was found both sides of the road which leads to the military establishment, together with terrace walls and two buildings. At Vamies the agricultural terraces have been planned. To the NW an ancient road is edged by two rows of orthostats. Near it are terraces and other structures, probably agricultural. Opposite the terraces are the traces of a quarry for ammouda. N of Vamies, in the region of Trapezoi are numerous agricultural structures. A systematic collection of pottery was necessary in the area of the 'sanctuary' because of the threat of modern cultivation. S of Vai, five quarries of pink marble have been found." Karphi Pediados. At Mnemata, the SM-PG cemetery exca- vated by Pendlebury, tomb robbers found and entered a small tholos tomb by removing the top of its roof. (ADelt 44) Kavousi. Work was continued by the ASCS. At Bronta, pottery from building E was studied. Material from the floor of room 1 comprised many pithoi with varied forms and decoration. Cleaning and conservation of part of the ceramic material and analysis of the stratigraphy shed light on the chronology of the building which was probably abandoned at the end of LM IIIC. Other material from adjacent buildings covered that from building E itself. Further material comes from a tomb above building E. Other material studied was from buildings J/K and I-O-N. At Bronta LG cemetery, the study of tombs from the area of the peak was completed. The material from tomb 6 and the area round it (building H) showed that this building was never an independent house, but that its construction goes with the tomb. In tomb 28 two amphoras with later burials were found. At Kastro study concerned the PG pottery and particularly phases IV and V of the stratigraphy. Phase V represents the transition from LM IIIC to PG. The small finds were also studied. Mochlos. Jeff Soles reports: "The study season at Mochlos resulted in the discovery of new masterpieces of Minoan art: a stirrup jar painted with two large tripuses (not octopuses), a two-handled goblet painted with a sacred boat with ikria fore and aft and a mast between, a large bridge-spouted jar, with mountains and a field of lilies and crocuses painted in colour perspective around its sides. The most startling find of all was that much of the pottery which lay alongside LM IB material here should be classified as LM II. Pottery of these two styles appears to have been used simultaneously. Three groups of olive pits from building A and a pottery kiln behind building B were submitted for radiocarbon analysis, two using the AMS technique and one the standard radiometric proceedure. A large piece of wood</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1995-96 charcoal (Pinus Brutia) with nearly 70 rings, was collected for dendrochronological analysis. All of these samples should produce good absolute dates for LM IB/II deposits." Mylos. At the Michaki plot, road widening operations disturbed a pit containing sherds, bronze pins and iron daggers. The material was dated LHL-ER. At the Schisma plot, on the side of the hill of Mylos, the site of ancient Lato, remains of houses were found, mostly destroyed, with a paved street between them and steps. (ADelt 45) Pseira Project. Philip P. Betancourt reports that 1995 com- pleted study for the Pseira Project: "The Project has compiled a plan of the visible structures in the M town which, at its height in LM IB had approximately 60 buildings. Nineteen tombs in the cemetery have been recorded, including 14 excavated or re-excavated and five empty tombs that were drawn and described. All artefacts from the tombs have been studied and catalogued pieces described, drawn and photographed." Schisma Elountas. Three robbed graves were found in the cemetery of anc. Olous. (ADelt 44) At the Methykaki plot, a rectangular structure 2.70 x 3.40m, and other rooms producing sherds of R pottery was found, along with a tholos building with its roof preserved. (ADelt 45) IIIC. It appears that the C city was founded in LG times. (ADelt 45) In 1995 the press reported the discovery, during trenching for a sewer, of seven graves and a ChT, dated from the end of the 4th to the 2nd Ct BC. Kisamou: Kastelli. At the Sophoulaki plot, two R houses were found, with disturbed levels in one trench producing mainly LM IIIA pottery. At Agia Eirene Kolymvariou, the site of an ancient city identified either as Pergamon or Polichna, a rural establishment, with large storage jars of LM IIIB/c was excavated in 1989. (ADelt 44) Rethymnon: Argyroupoli. Walls and a paved road were found in 1990. The oldest phase is LHL-ER, and is follwed by a LR phase and destruction in the 4th Ct AD. (ADelt 45) At Patsas Amariou, a headless marble statue of Pan was found by the church of Agios Antonios, together with a deposit of cow horns and an A cup. (ADelt 44) A joint Greek/Italian excavation in 1989 and 1990 at Sybritos Amariou found graves with LM IIIC pottery, as well as SM, PG and G, with indications of continuous use to EHL. Building remains contain LM IIIC and G sherds. (ADelt 44 and 45). R. A. TOMLINSON British School at Athens WESTERN CRETE (25th Ephorate) Aptera. The press reported the excavation in 1995 of large public buildings, probably temples, in an area which was in use from the 8th Ct BC. A building with a peristyle courtyard of 5 x 7 columns was founded in HL times, but has R repairs. The cemetery area outside the walls has been investigated, producing pithos and jar burials of the 8th and 7th Ct BC, rock-cut and cist tombs of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC. It appears the city was founded in the G period, and reached its acme in HL. Chania. At the Papadopoulos plot, remains from EM to LM IIIB were found in 1989, the upper strata having been removed by mechanical levelling of the site in 1974, except for a G well which was cut into the earlier levels. The most extensive building belonged to LM IB and was destroyed by earthquake and fire about 1450 BC. Six rooms of this were found. It was rebuilt on the same alignment in LM IIIA. The most significant discovery is a MM III/LM IB ritual purification basin with painted decoration on its walls, and containing well-preserved fragments of fallen painted plaster from upper rooms. This is the first example to be found in W Crete. (ADelt 44) At the site for the municipal car park, four excavations were carried out in 1990. At the first, a building complex with two large rooms with a stoa of unfluted columns was found, together with a small bath building with hypocaust and furnace. This is possibly part of the agora of Graeco-Roman Kydonia. The second excavation produced Ott and ECh graves over R walls and a workshop area of LCL-EHL. This appears to be a potter's shop, producing terracotta offerings, especially figurines of a female seated on a throne. It is suggested that this is part of the potters' quarter. The third area produced walls and a circular cistern, the fourth the hypocaust of a big bath building, which had been abandoned when stoas were built in the 2nd Ct AD. On the hill of Kastelli, excavation established the stratigraphy from LM IIIB/c to the present. It was noted that there was a gap of some two centuries after LM SOURCES OF ILLUSTRATIONS: Swedish Institute 1 Th. Spyropoulos 2 German Institute 3-6 French School 7-20, 33-35 M.
