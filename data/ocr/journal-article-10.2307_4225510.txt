<plain_text><page sequence="1">J e JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XVIII No. 4 December 1984 Liberation Theology, the New Religious Political Right, and Veblen's Ambivalent View of Christianity Charles G. Leathers One of the more curious aspects of Thorstein Veblen's evolutionary social theory was his vision of two different forms of Christianity. As a modern leisure class institution, Christianity in Veblen's view was a social atavism, inherently irrational in nature. Its social effects were to exert a conservative influence over spiritual attitudes, retard economic efficiency, sustain a system of status and fealty, and add substantially to the con- spicuous waste of economic resources. But in one essay, "Christian Morals and the Competitive System," Veblen proclaimed the existence of a natural Christianity rooted in hereditary impulses toward brother- hood and mutual service.' Surprisingly, in his closing comments, he inti- mated that this natural Christianity verged on manifesting into a revolu- tionary social force. Several scholars have commented on the contradictions created by the appearance of natural Christianity in Veblen's social theory.2 Veblen offered only this single discussion of it. Significantly, no subsequent refer- ence to a revolutionary social force emanating from a Christian impulse appears in The Instinct of Workmanship. Yet, that fleeting vision of "good" natural Christianity against the backdrop of "bad" institutional Christianity offers a unique perspective from which to view the contem- porary polar cases of radical Christian social-political activism-the lib- The author is Professor of Economics, University of Alabama. 1155</page><page sequence="2">1156 Charles G. Leathers eration theology movement in Latin America and the new religious po- litical right in the United States. Institutional vs. Natural Christianity In the opening paragraph of the "Christian Morals" essay, Veblen in- troduced Christian morals (natural Christianity) as being a phenomenon quite distinct from "the religious cult of Christianity" (institutional Chris- tianity) .3 He stated that while the future of institutional Christianity had been placed in doubt by "the current materialistic outlook and the current skepticism touching supernatural matters," such was not the case for the "morals of Christianity."4 Institutional Christianity Veblen had discussed the characteristics and future of institutional Christianity in earlier works, especially in The Theory of the Leisure Class under the general heading of "devout observances."5 His purpose was to explain the sociological nature of "devoutness" and to ascertain the effect of the "tangible, external features of devout observances" on economic progress.6 "Devoutness" is a mental habit, an atavistic behavioral trait with ori- gins in the animistic, anthropomorphic tendencies of the peaceable sav- ages. It entails belief in a preternatural being to whom is imputed awe- some powers and a capricious personality. This divinity must be con- tinuously bribed, cajoled, and placated in some fashion. Religion as a modern social institution has evolved from barbaric "anthropomorphic cults." Since those cults were shaped under the influence of the dominant predatory animus, they were pervaded by the principle of status, mani- fested in fealty and subservience to the invisible divine master. In the later quasi-peaceable stage of culture, the personality imputed to the divinity softened to that of a divine patriarch, but the barbaric influence lingers on in the doctrines and ceremonies of modern churches. Worship continues to involve a regime of status, emphasizing a need to continuously pacify the divine patriarch by extolling his greatness and glory through con- spicuous displays of subservience and fealty.7 In the modern leisure class culture of the business enterprise system, institutional Christianity exerts a conservative, and hence negative, in- fluence on the behavior of the underlying population. The churches of the wealthier class nurture archaic habits that encourage invidious compar-</page><page sequence="3">Veblen and Christianity 1157 isons and conspicuous waste, reflected not only in religious edifices and ceremonies, but also in the definition of acceptable behavior of clergy. As servants of a higher, invisible master, clergy rank high in the emulative social structure. But the archaic notion of ceremonial cleanliness of priests requires that clergy show no concern for their personal material welfare and exhibit no knowledge of or interest in the secular affairs of the com- munity. Along with leisure class women, they are expected to be con- spicuously exempted from any useful industrial pursuits.8 Why is the future of institutional Christianity in doubt? Archaic, ata- vistic habits ("devoutness") and institutions ("anthropomorphic cults") are incompatible with the modern collective order being shaped by ad- vanced technology and the industrial processes. Supernatural explana- tions of natural phenomena conflict with the logic and empiricism of science, and mental attitudes of fealty fostered by devoutness reduce eco- nomic efficiency by obstructing an adequate adjustment of institutions to new economic exigencies. Modern industrial processes exert an influence that selectively erodes devoutness from the mental attitudes of those at- tendant to the machine processes." Thus, the future of institutional Chris- tianity is not bright: "In an increasing proportion as time goes on, the anthropomorphic cult, with its code of devout observances, suffers a pro- gressive disintegration through the stress of economic exigencies and the decay of the system of status.""' Veblen observed that interest in religion among artisans had already diminished. Even businessmen were visibly lacking in religious fervor, complacently retaining devotional habits out of a desire for respectability and because pecuniary pursuits keep predatory traits and subservience alive. Devoutness remains strong only among members of the leisure class insulated from the discipline of the industrial processes (especially fe- males whose role in social life stresses the archaic habits of subservience and fealty), in rural communities where industrial development and stan- dards of education are low, and among classes generally lacking in eco- nomic efficiency or educational opportunity.'1 To some extent, however, the future of institutional Christianity was being shaped by church infiltration by "non-invidious interests" that somehow survived predacious barbarism. In general terms, these interests manifest into a sense of human solidarity and sympathy and of com- munion with the environment or the generic life process.'2 Their effect was to shift the nature of church activities and concerns away from the anthropomorphic content and toward beneficial service to the community. But Veblen was skeptical about these non-invidious interests having a</page><page sequence="4">1158 Charles G. Leathers significant impact. They seriously conflicted with the "affirmative sanc- tion of the code of properties" common to the leisure class culture, a conflict they could not possibly win.'3 The Natural Christianity of Christian Models Veblen's purpose in the "Christian Morals" essay was to evaluate the compatibility of the two great sets of codes of conduct intimately involved in western civilization: Christian morals and the ethics of pecuniary com- petition. Both are institutional factors of first-class importance, and each appears to occupy a dominant position. Is there an irreconcilable discrep- ancy between the two, and if so, what would happen to western civiliza- tion if one or the other should disappear?'4 Unrelated to the animistic, anthropomorphic traits that produced insti- tutional Christianity, there is a "Christian animus" that reduces to two basic moral principles not common to other great religions: brotherly love, or the impulse to mutual service, and non-resistance, or humility.15 The first principle is deeply rooted in hereditary human nature. Chris- tianity came by it through a cultural reversion to the animus of the primi- tive peaceable savage. Non-resistence is a newer trait, one that is not an element of human nature. But it was acquired under the same historical conditions-Roman oppression-that were responsible for the reversion to the impulse toward mutual service. Under Roman rule, the subjected people were leveled socially to a homogeneous state in which neither class nor individual distinctions could exist. The principle of non-resistence was sornehow acquired as a maxim of conduct for a people "who had been beaten to a pulp."'6 Simul- taneously, there occurred the cultural reversion to the peaceable savage's impulse toward mutual service. "The pride of caste and all the principles of differential dignity and honor fell away, and left mankind naked and unashamed and free to follow the promptings of hereditary savage human nature which make for fellowship and Christian charity."''7 In the history of Christian societies, these Christian principles have been most at home among the poorer divisions of the Christian cult, and especially among oppressed peoples. The morality of wealthier Christians is less that of non-resistence and brotherly love, and more that of coercive control and kindly tutelage, traits not distinctively Christian. (In fact, Veblen noted, the morality of wealthier Christians differs little in substance from either Judaism or Islam.) 18 The ethics of pecuniary competition are of much more recent origin. They are rooted in the natural rights philosophy that emerged in the in-</page><page sequence="5">Veblen and Christianity 1159 dustrial period of handicraft, acquiring a modicum of public sanction by virtue of the visible connection between an individual's production of serviceable goods and community welfare. The system of pecuniary ego- ism, self-interest, or individualism reached its mature development in the eighteenth century. "The principles governing right conduct according to the habits of thought native to this individualistic era are the egoistic prin- ciples of natural rights and natural liberty. These rights and this liberty are egoistic rights and liberty of the individual. They are to be summed up as freedom and security of person and of pecuniary transactions."", Since both sets of codes of conduct appear in the modern setting as legacies of the past, how does each function in the new order? Veblen observed that the Christian principle of non-resistence has been virtually eliminated, with only a "sophisticated affectation" of it remaining.20 Of first-order importance among the early Christians, that principle was of lesser importance among Christians less cruelly suppressed. It was least firmly rooted in the outer fringes of the European communities, especi- ally Britain and Scandanavia. Because of the conditions that spawned non-resistance-bare-handed despotism and servile helplessness-are now largely absent from the western culture, it has ceased to be a notice- able influence on Christian behavior.21 Such has not been the case, however, for the older, ubiquitous trait of brotherly love. Although it weakens at times, it continuously reasserts itself in economic matters in an impulsive approval of activities and be- havior that contribute to the community welfare and disapproval of those that do not. This trait, said Veblen, is "really nothing more than a some- what specialized manifestation of the instinct of workmanship, and as such it has the indefeasible vitality that belongs to the hereditary traits of human nature."22 In contrast, the ethics of pecuniary competition-the ethics of indi- vidualism and pecuniary freedom-are in the process of disintegration, losing what little social sanction they once enjoyed before modern tech- nology and organizations destroyed the apparent relationship between individual use of property and the output of serviceable products. In the current situation, with business having taken on "the character of an im- personal, dispassionate, not to say graceless, investment for profit," there is little to keep pecuniary ethics in touch with the "impulsive bias of brotherly love." But there is much in this situation that creates an effec- tual discrepancy between that impulsive bias and pecuniary ethics.23 Veblen's closing comments can easily be interpreted as suggesting that future social developments may be substantially influenced by the Chris- tian impulse of brotherly love, and that any future society so shaped will</page><page sequence="6">1160 Charles G. Leathers be characterized by an absence of the ethics of pecuniary competition- a strong hint of revolutionary social force impelled by natural Christian- ity. "Except for a possible reversion to a cultural situation strongly char- acterized by ideals of emulation and status, the ancient racial bias em- bodied in the Christian principle of brotherhood should logically continue to gain ground at the expense of the pecuniary morals of competitive business."24 Liberation Theology and the New Religious Political Right The preceding review of Veblen's ambivalent view of Christianity serves as the foundation for the main thrust of this article, namely, to examine the liberation theology movement in Latin America from the perspective of Veblen's natural Christianity, and the new religious polit- ical right in the United States according to Veblen's assessment of insti- tutional Christianity. The one element that these two phenomena have in common is their emphasis upon translating the Christian faith into so- cial and political activism. But their interpretations of the Christian faith as a political and social ideology and policies are virtual polar opposites on the ideological spectrum. Liberation Theology and Natural Christianity As a general term, "liberation theology" refers to several contempo- rary social movements within the Christian church-black liberation the- ology, feminist liberation theology, and Latin American. While each con- stitutes a significant social phenomenon, our focus is on the last, which has emerged primarily among Catholics in Latin America, the most "Christianized" area of the Third World. A growing consciousness of the reality of inequality, poverty, and oppression of the masses in Latin Amer- ica has compelled some Catholics to critically re-evaluate the doctrines of the Church. Liberation theology emerged from that critical reflection, challenging the relevance of traditional Christian thought and its redeem- ing powers for millions of Latin Americans suffering under oppressive social and political structures.25 The essence of liberation theology appears to be a vision of unity be- tween reformation of the Christian church and redemption of secular so- ciety through liberation. The traditional emphasis on individual salvation is regarded as a distortion of the teachings of Jesus, who is viewed as being concerned with full and integral liberation. With Christ as the Lib- erator in both spiritual and social terms, the mission of the Church is to</page><page sequence="7">Veblen and Christianity 1161 call the world to social justice and freedom as the means of realizing sal- vation. In recognition of a historical unity between oppressed classes and Christian faith, there is a manifest emphasis on solidarity with oppressed, poverty-stricken masses. But it is not sufficient to simply share the suffer- ing of the masses in the traditional way of humility and non-resistance. Solidarity in a liberationist context means a social-political activism to promote social changes that will eliminate oppression and poverty, and bring political participation to the masses. The Medellin documents, approved by the Second General Conference of the Latin American Bishops (CELAM) in 1968, gave prominence to the theme of liberation as both a socio-political term and a theological one at a time when liberation theology was still in a formative stage and the movement was just beginning to emerge. These documents addressed the Latin American situation in liberationist language of economic de- pendence, domination, and imperialism. Liberal capitalism was criti- cized for errors in the concepts of property rights. International mone- tary imperialism and internal monopolies were blamed for keeping the region in a state of economic dependence. Those now in power and au- thority in Latin America were condemned for attacking the public good, favoring the privileged groups, and employing institutional violence. A strong appeal was made for a just new order in which the masses could become the subject of their own historical reality, participating fully in the governmental processes. Grass-roots organizations were proposed to work for the rights of the masses.26 The Medellin documents express liberationist views acceptable to the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in the region. Without breaking with the general stance of CELAM's own Gaudium et spes ("Pastoral Consti- tution of the Church in the New World") and Pope Paul VI's Populorum progressio ("On the Development of Peoples"), these documents effec- tively shifted liberation theology in a more radical direction.27 There was, however, no endorsement of actual revolution or violent resistance of authority by the masses. Nor was there any association with Marxist social theory in the documents. A number of the leading writers of liberation theology in Latin Amer- ica have become very critical of the reformist nature of the development approach as the solution to the problems of the masses, and see a radical liberation from the current system as offering the onlv acceptable option. Some of these have been drawn to Marxian social theory and have at- tempted to integrate Marxism with Christianity. Gustavo Gutierrez, for example, speaks of a "direct and fruitful confrontation" between con- temporary theology and Marx.28 Dennis P. McCann has described Gutier-</page><page sequence="8">1162 Charles G. Leathers rez's position as one in which the "Word of the Lord" serves as the in- spiration for a criticism of tradition, employing the Marxist modes of social analysis.29 For many Catholics, the introduction of Marxian social theory into liberation theology created significant conflicts. Marxism is widely re- garded among Catholics as an atheistic, secular dogma of materialism, the self-proclaimed enemy of all religions. In socio-political terms, a strongly Marxist orientation to liberation theology would lead the movement to seek socialism as the only social order in which true liberation could be realized. While this might be compatible with the rejection of capitalism by non-Marxists in the liberation theology movement, it would also con- flict with the traditional Catholic view that since both socialism and cap- italism are morally deficient, only some form of an organic society could be compatible with Christianity.30 The involvement of Marxism also has the effect of intensifying the demand on the Church to explicitly endorse an ideology of social revolution and abandon its traditional claim of ideo- logical neutrality in secular affairs. In a world of class conflict and com- peting ideologies, a claim to neutrality by a major social institution is regarded as tantamount to an implicit endorsement of the prevailing ide- ology justifying the existing oppressive social-political order. In light of Veblen's closing comments in the "Christian Morals" essay, the emergence of the Latin American liberation theology movement raises an intriguing question. To what extent does that movement, in its general dimensions, suggest a manifestation of Veblen's natural Christianity into a revolutionary social force? In an attempt to answer that question, we can examine the degree to which the liberation theology movement ap- pears compatible with Veblen's view of Christian morals and the effectual discrepancy between those morals and the ethics of pecuniary competi- tion. Certainly, the fundamental impulse that drives the liberation theology movement appears to be the same basic impulse toward brotherhood, mu- tual service, and Christian charity that Veblen described. We are not sug- gesting, of course, that the liberation theologists would accept Veblen's explanation of the source of that Christian principle as acquired through a cultural reversion to the animus of the peaceable savage. But in the so- ciological aspects of that impulse, an obvious compatibility exists be- tween liberation theology's emphasis on solidarity with the oppressed masses and Veblen's comment that the Christian trait of brotherly love historically was most at home among the oppressed classes. There is also a commonality in the primacy of concern for the community welfare and</page><page sequence="9">Veblen and Christianity 1163 in a perceived incompatibility between Christian values and the competi- tive individualistic private enterprise system. Moreover, the liberation theologists' disillusionment with the reformist approach of the develop- ment model, and their preference for a radical liberationist approach to socio-economic change, are compatible with Veblen's lack of interest in reformist schemes. On the other hand, certain features of the liberation theology move- ment might appear to impose irreconcilable differences with Veblen's inti- mation of a manifestation of natural Christianity into a revolutionary so- cial force. We can demonstrate, however, that such apparent differences can be easily reconciled with Veblen's sociological analysis of Christian morals. Veblen focused on developments in an advanced industrial, pecuniary culture, not on a Third World socio-economic environment. A relatively narrow interpretation of his remarks would suggest that certain condi- tions were necessary in order for natural Christianity to blossom into a stong social force. One was the collective economic order imposed by modern technology and industrial processes in which the failure of pe- cuniary ethics to serve the community welfare becomes increasingly ob- vious. This would suggest that the pecuniary system must be sufficiently advanced to expose its weaknesses to the general population. In addi- tion, it seems clear that the conservative strength of both the ethics of pecuniary competition and the institutional Church must be substantially eroded, and the newer, acquired Christian trait of non-resistance must be virtually eliminated as an influence on Christian behavior. Certain of Veblen's own comments would seem to mitigate against the possibility that natural Christianity would find a favorable environment in the Latin American culture. In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veb- len noted that in the older communities of European culture (largely trans- ferred to the Latin American colonies of the New World), both the hered- itary leisure class and the masses were much more devout than the indus- trial middle class. Given the relative smallness of the middle class in such societies, the devoutness of these communities tends to be exceptionally strong.31 He noted further in Absentee Ownership that the "Latin" col- onies were not "addicted to democratic institutions, mechanical indus- tries, and business enterprise" as were the English-speaking colonies.32 The exceptional degree of devoutness and the lack of democracy in Latin America, combined with the lack of the direct social influence of indus- trialization, would tend to preserve both a conservative mentality and the Christian trait of non-resistance.</page><page sequence="10">1164 Charles G. Leathers This is not the conclusion that we derive, however, from Veblen's dis- cussion of natural Christianity as a social development. We infer that it is the general existence of a collective socio-economic order that nurtures a potentially revolutionary natural Christianity. Thus, a society need not be industrialized, but only part of a collective order in which the indus- trial processes dominate at some point. Veblen's analysis of the business enterprise system in the early 1900s specifically recognized the global dimensions of that "new order," in which the Third World countries are integral elements existing in positions of dependence and dominated by the interests of the industrialized powers. The collective nature of this new international order provides an environment conducive to natural Christianity's growth (given the prevalence of Christianity as the domi- nant religion) in any part of the system. Moreover, public sanctioning of the ethics of individual property and pecuniary freedom is not deeply rooted in the dependent societies. Hence, we would expect that sanction to evaporate rapidly as those people become increasingly cognizant of the negative consequences of the system for their present and future welfare. The caustic comments that Veblen made in oblique reference to the Catholic Church in Absentee Ownership ("the most heavily capitalized of these public concerns of the supernatural") may raise serious doubts that he expected natural Christianity to emerge from within that institu- tion.33 At some point, natural Christianity and institutional Christianity shared a common existence. But it is quite clear that if the former is to manifest into an impulse that produces social change, the latter must lose its conservative influence. Can we demonstrate that such has been the case in Latin America? In Veblenian social theory, institutional change rarely occurs in the form of a clean break with the past, such that archaic institutions simply melt away. Rather, institutions change slowly under the pressures created by the stress and grind of ordinary life. In that respect the Church in Latin America has been subjected to tremendous stress and grind from the jolting reality of the poverty and oppression of the masses, the ma- jority of whom look to the Church for salvation. Consequently, the Church has weakened at points, allowing natural Christianity an oppor- tunity to flourish. The growth of natural Christianity, in turn, created additional pressure for change in the institutional Church. Thus, the critical question is not whether Veblen's natural Christianity could emerge as a revolutionary force from within the Church, but rather whether the conservative forces within the hierarchy of that institution might be able to suppress the growing influence of natural Christianity in</page><page sequence="11">Veblen and Christianity 1165 social and political affairs of the region. Significantly, strong opposition to liberation theology's activist social stance has come from the Vatican, that part of the Church most insulated from the points of stress. Pope John Paul II has warned clergy in Latin America to avoid becoming in- volved in political activism, to adhere to traditional pastoral duties, and to shun the "alien doctrine" of Marxism. He has urged the people of the region to keep demands for social change within the Church's tradition of opposition to violence. He has also warned of the dangers of embrac- ing collective systems that are as oppressive to human dignity as is pure economic capitalism.34 On the other hand, the Pope appears fully cognizant of the impulses toward brotherly love and mutual service that have given rise to the de- mands for social change. It is noteworthy that (at least to our knowledge) the Vatican has not prescribed the traditional Christian approach of hu- mility, forbearance, and passive non-resistence to secular oppression and economic inequality. For the moment, at least, institutional change within the Church is apparently being induced by something closely resembling Veblen's natural Christianity, manifested in the liberation theology move- ment. The Pope's admonition to Latin American clergy to shun the "alien doctrine" of Marxism raises another possible point of conflict between liberation theology and Veblen's natural Christianity. Does the presence of Marxian social theory in the literature of liberation theology preclude any compatibility between that movement and Veblen's revolutionary natural Christianity? At first glance, it might seem that we are being drawn into the debate over the compatibility between Marxism and Veblen's social analysis.35 But for the question that concerns us, the Marxist orien- tation that appears in the literature of liberation theology has no signifi- cant bearing. As a movement, liberation theology has sprung in robust form from a Christian concern with brotherhood, solidarity with the op- pressed masses, and collective justice rooted in the Christian concepts of human dignity. Arthur F. McGovern's comments effectively make our point: "Liberation Theology is not grounded in Marxism. It is grounded in the experiences of peoples of Latin America and in faith reflection."36 This is not to diminish the possible importance of Marxian social the- ory in influencing the ultimate direction and form of liberation theology. Marxian modes of social analysis serve as tools used by some leading liberationist writers to give methodological definition in the search for an understanding of the nature of the social relationships involved. But our interest is in the underlying impulses responsible for the spontaneous</page><page sequence="12">1166 Charles G. Leathers emergence of the movement. Therein lies what we conclude to be a very strong and very interesting similarity between the liberation theology movement and Veblen's revolutionary natural Christianity. The New Religious Political Right While the Latin American liberation theology movement reveals a rev- olutionary, strongly humanistic, anti-capitalist orientation, the new re- ligious political right (henceforth, the NRPR) in the United States is reactionary, anti-humanistic (by its own declaration), and pro-capitalist in its drive to politicize fundamentalist interpretations of the Christian faith.37 It shows little concern for the larger moral issues, for example, social justice, human rights, world peace, and world hunger. Instead, it has sought to politically mobilize certain groups by taking strong policy positions, backed by proclamations of moral authority, on relatively nar- row issues. Essentially, the NRPR's "moral" political program summarizes as: (1) opposition to legalized abortion; (2) opposition to pornography, homosexuality, and sexual permissiveness in general; (3) strong support for traditional sex roles, manifested in a fervent opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment; (4) demands for prayer in public schools and the teaching of "creationism" as a science, preferably at the exclusion of the evolution theory; and (5) a strident nationalism manifested in demands for a strong national defense policy, largely directed against the Soviet Union. One writer has described the NRPR's program as "espousing a tripar- tite combination of traditionalism, militant anti-communism, and eco- nomic libertarianism."38 Samuel Hill and Dennis Owen have suggested that a perfect society as visualized by the NRPR would feature happy nuclear families with clearly defined traditional sex roles, the church and family in control of all important social processes, a government that punishes evil and provides defense against enemies, and explicit recog- nition by the nation of God's overriding sovereignty.39 In its political activism, the NRPR has merged nationalism and re- ligious fundamentalism, asserting that the United States has a divine mis- sion to be the greatest nation in the world. That mission can be accom- plished, however, only if the authority of God is recognized in both pub- lic and private life. The current problems (real and alleged) experienced by the United States result from national immorality. The major source of that immorality is the insidious influence of "secular humanists," that</page><page sequence="13">Veblen and Christianity 1167 is, liberals in politics, economics, social philosophy, and religion. Liberals in public offices and the federal judiciary have morally weakened the United States by banning prayer in the public schools, excluding the creationist doctrine from the science curriculum, legalizing abortions (often paid for with public funds), relaxing censorship of obscenity in the media, protecting and extending the rights of homosexuals, and weak- ening the nation's military capability in the face of a growing menace- international communism. Religious liberals are responsible for a serious erosion of allegience to the true moral authority revealed to all funda- mentalist Christians through literal interpretations of Biblical scriptures. For the NRPR, there is only one prescription for the moral failure of the United States-election of public officials who bow to God's sover- eignty, who understand what God has planned for the United States, and who will stand resolute against U.S. enemies. In identifying those who are "moral" candidates for public office, the NRPR exhibits a fine sense of pragmatism. The critical need is to remove all "secular humanists," that is, liberals, from positions of influence. In government, this requires marshalling strong political support for traditional conservative candi- dates, even those not religiously oriented. The ambiguity of "second-best" alternatives does not exist for the NRPR on this issue. Evidently, being conservative is a definite second-best alternative to being truly "moral." In the realm of the NRPR's political morality, materialism goes hand in hand with nationalism and Christianity. In sharp contrast with early Christians, the NRPR does not denounce or renounce materialism, nor does it urge moderation in the consumerist tendencies of individuals (other than to solicit generous donations to the various NRPR organiza- tions). On the contrary, material wealth is deemed to be a just reward from God to his chosen people. A nation destined by divine plan to be great must be blessed materially to enable it to stand strong against its enemies. Moreover, a wealthy nation of conspicuously affluent consumers serves as a beacon to other nations by indicating visibly how God rewards the moral and faithful. This fusion of nationalism, materialism, and fundamentalist Christian beliefs leads to an endorsement of capitalism as the "moral" economic system. Since communism opposes religion, the great enemy from without is the Soviet Union. And since communism opposes capitalism (and "sec- ular humanists" also tend to criticize capitalism), the capitalist system must be morally good. According to Jerry Falwell: "The free enterprise movement is clearly outlined in the Book of Proverbs in the Bible. Jesus Christ made it clear that the work ethic was part of his plan for man,</page><page sequence="14">1168 Charles G. Leathers Ownership of property is Biblical. Competition in business is Biblical. Ambitious and successful business management is clearly outlined as a part of God's plan for His people."40 Who responds to the NRPR's political sermons? The membership draws heavily from the evangical and fundamentalist Protestant groups, although no major denomination has endorsed it. Not all fundamentalist ministers endorse the attempt to politicize their doctrines. Similarly, while television ministries have played an important role in reaching a wide audience and raising funds, not all TV ministers support the NRPR. Some supporters are only "fellow travelers," people without particularly strong religious beliefs who nonetheless share the general opinion that God has destined the United States to be great and that somehow, a national moral deterioration is obstructing realization of that destiny. In addition, finan- cial support (and considerable "lip-service" support) comes from con- servatives with indifferent religious views who recognize the strategic value of a religious/political attack against liberals. The NRPR's "devout" supporters come largely from the working classes. Hill and Owen have described many of these as people "not long removed from economic and political marginality who now enjoy reason- able standards of living facilitated by jobs calling for skilled labor."'41 Geo- graphically, the core of the membership is concentrated in the South and the Midwest, areas in which people have traditionally been conservative in both politics and religion. Although not explicitly racist, the NRPR has not attempted to compete with black churches for black members. Pre- sumably, few black Americans would find their interests served by the conservative political and social policies supported by the NRPR. A Veblenian Assessment of the NRPR From a Veblenian perspective, it is doubtful that the NRPR can be regarded as a bona fide social movement. That is, it does not appear to have emerged spontaneously as a mass movement from forces rooted in deep commitments to certain values. Rather, in many respects it has the appearance of a contrived movement, one that has been carefully orches- trated, using modern persuasive approaches and techniques to exploit the religious and nationalistic emotions of certain groups. While it reminds us of Veblen's caustic comments about churches and salesmanship in A b- sentee Ownership,42 it really does not appear to have been a natural out- growth of institutional Christianity. Rather, it has exploited various ele- ments of what Veblen referred to as the newer, working-class sects of in- stitutional Christianity. Perhaps Veblen himself would have regarded the</page><page sequence="15">Veblen and Christianity 1169 NRPR in much the same way he did the YMCA. Joseph Dorfman quotes Walter J. Shepherd as stating that Veblen "had no use for the YMCA. He considered it a bourgeois and capitalist agency to defend the existing order."43 To the extent that institutional Christianity is involved, the goal (in a Veblenian sense) is apparently to restore the "anthropomorphic" purity of Christian institutions, in the process altering the image of God back to the barbarian warrior chieftain image of the Old Testament. In this vein, the attacks on liberals in religion suggest attempts to purify the churches of those "non-invidious interests" that channel church concerns away from "devoutness" and toward activist concerns with community service. But it is not this archaic anthropomorphic emphasis that makes the NRPR a unique social phenomenon, as it shares that emphasis with all fundamentalist groups. Rather, it is the drive to mold archaic, predacious attitudes into a political authoritarianism combined with a capitalist eco- nomic order that makes the NRPR worthy of a Veblenian sociological assessment. The vast difference between the NRPR's version of "Chris- tian morals" and Veblen's vision of natural impulses toward brotherly love and and Christian charity is obvious. The NRPR's "Christian moral- ity" is loaded with pronounced predatory traits, self-regarding proclivities within the framework of status rooted in fealty to the divinity, and in- vidious distinctions based on being one of the "chosen" people. The ele- ment of Christian love and brotherhood is strikingly absent (although the terms are used to express an entirely different meaning in the political sermons). The NRPR deliberately rejects the archaic notion of the clergy not being involved in secular affairs. But at the same time, it seeks to impose an equally archaic order that suggests in some ways a "cultural reversion" to feudalism, with the Church holding both spiritual and secular powers and the underlying population passively submitting to the authority of those in power. But the NRPR's new order would not be compatible with feudalism. Missing are the elaborate religious and other social institutions of such a static society, although these could re-emerge at some point. More importantly, the NRPR's embracing of an individualistic, business- oriented materialism is incompatible with the corporate spirit of feudal- ism. As a "cultural reversion" the NRPR's new order more closely re- sembles the Puritan society of the 1600s. But even here there is a major discrepancy. The Puritans would undoubtedly object to the conspicuous consumerist tendencies of both the NRPR's leadership and membership. In its defense of capitalism as the Christian economic order, the NRPR is attempting to play explicitly the role played implicitly by the upper-</page><page sequence="16">1170 Charles G. Leathers class churches of Veblen's day. The key question, in a Veblenian assess- ment of the NRPR, is why an essentially working-class membership would support the NRPR's curious amalgamation of religious fundamentalism, political conservatism, and capitalist economic philosophy. Why would people in a society that has traditionally taken great pride in a national commitment to critical rationalist attitudes, scientific attitudes, and ad- vancing technology willingly receive a religious-political doctrine that imposes an irrational, anti-scientific mentality upon certain fields of knowledge? Why would a member of the underlying population, Veb- len's "common man," accept the intrusion of religious and political au- thoritarianism into his personal life, and approve social and economic policies clearly aimed at benefiting the vested interests and absentee owners? We do not have to look very far into Veblen's social theory to identify one major factor-the influence of nationalism. The common man, who collectively possesses in a democratic system the power to rule, to imple- ment policies that would be in the collective interest, is deluded by his patriotic fervor into believing that what is in the interest of large owners of property is equally in his interest.44 The NRPR has succeeded in ex- ploiting the irrational tendencies associated with both "devoutness" and nationalism. Moreover, in a Veblenian analysis, the success of that en- deavor has a particular relationship with the geographical concentration of the membership. In his discussions of "devoutness," Veblen predicted that regions with rural populations and little industrial development would be particularly devout. Despite the growing industrialization of the South and Midwest, a large residue of that devoutness has remained. The integration of religious values and nationalism with business values is noted in Veblen's comment concerning country towns: "National integrity, religious intolerance, and business principles march together under the banners of the country town in a co-partnership of means and ends, for the Glory of God and the good of man."45 Veblen's comments about the attitudes of farmers may be relevant to an explanation of why working-class people willingly accept the con- servative policies and irrational principles advocated by the NRPR. While the material circumstances faced by farmers should instill a community spirit and encourage collective enterprise, farmers have never been actu- ated by a true community spirit in their economic concerns. On the con- trary, they steadfastly cling to the illusion of being independent, self- sufficient, masterless men of property, and thus politically support policies that primarily benefit the vested interests and absentee owners.46 Mem-</page><page sequence="17">Veblen and Christianity 1171 bers of the working classes who support the NRPR may have retained some of the farmers' mentality. With their recent rise above economic marginality, perhaps they have acquired an image of themselves as "inde- pendent, self-sufficient men of property" who share equally in the fortunes and concerns of the vested interests. The frustrations experienced by many "patriotic" Americans over Viet Nam and the Iranian hostage crsis provided an environment ripe for ex- ploitation by the NRPR. But nationalism is not sufficient in itself to explain why so many people have accepted the NRPR's attack on scien- tific theories and knowledge. This is especially odd as the NRPR warmly applauds those technological achievements responsible for the material gains enjoyed by an affluent society, as well as the "star wars" instru- ments of nuclear warfare. Perhaps the key to explaining the irrational behavioral tendencies of many of the "devout" NRPR supporters is to be found in Veblen's discussion of the alienating effects of modern tech- nology, scientific knowledge, and the discipline imposed by modern in- dustrial processes. In The Instinct of Workmanship, Veblen noted that an unqualified ma- terialistic and mechanical animus such as is demanded by the logic of the machine processes is missing from the "native strain of human nature."47 In his judgment, human nature was most compatible with conditions of life under "moderately advanced savagery." The limit of tolerance native to the race, physically and spiritually, is short of that unmitigated materialism and unremitting mechanical routine to which the machine technology incontinently drives.48 Neither the manner of life imposed by the machine process, nor the man- ner of thought inculcated by habituation of its logic, will fall in with the free movement of the human spirit, born, as it is, to fit the conditions of savage life.49 Not only do people in various classes at various times become alienated by the routine of life imposed by the machine processes, they are also alienated by modern scientific inquiry-"thinking in uncoloured mecha- nistic terms alone." Modern science challenges the comforting security of traditional beliefs and renders false certain theological tenets. The result- ing psychological stress leads to a visible resistence that manifests in "an irrepressible-in a sense, congenital-recrudescence of magic, occult science, telepathy, spiritualism, vitalism, pragmatism."50 Lay people seek escapism in "the fog of occult and esoteric faiths and cults, and so fall back on the will to believe things of which the senses transmit no evi-</page><page sequence="18">1172 Charles G. Leathers dence."51 Even the "learned and studious" experience the "stress of the same 'aching void,' " and become attracted to "speculative tenets of os- tensible knowledge that purport to go nearer to the heart of reality, and that elude all mechanistic proof or disproof."52 Of what relevance is such alienation to the behavioral tendencies of the "devout" NRPR supporters? We would suggest that modern science and technology have created tensions that may make certain groups particu- larly susceptible to the NRPR's political sermons in much the same way that the people Veblen noted sought escape in the fog of estoeric faiths. Modern technology has produced ambivalent feelings. On the one hand, the human senses, both physical and emotional, have been entertained and gratified by technological advancements. Life has become infinitely more pleasurable and comfortable with the emergence of greater con- sumption opportunities and advancements in medical care. But on the other hand, the ever-expanding realms of science and technology have de- stroyed traditional social relationships, undermined traditional beliefs, threatened the natural environment, and increasingly taken on an appear- ance of being as magical and supernatural as certain natural phenomena did to the primitive savages. Moreover, the economic security of many groups of people in the United States has been shaken by the effects of rapidly changing industrial technology. These changes, summarized by such terms as "the deindus- trialization of America" and "factories without lights," raise fears of economic losses not only among those most directly affected, but also among others who anticipate that the same fate may be in store for them. This insecurity, combined with ambivalent attitudes toward science and technology, may cause certain people with tendencies toward "devout- ness" to long desperately for the comfort of a divinity that combines tra- ditional security (a patriarch who commands our destinies) with the ma- terial magic of modern computerized technology and miracle cures for illnesses. The NRPR may seem to offer such an avenue of escape with its vision of the secular and spiritual worlds. One further comment on this point is in order. Veblen noted that the tendency toward "fantastic, archaising cults and beliefs and . . . make- believe credence in occult insights and powers was occurring primarily among the "moderately well-to-do, the half-idle class."53 The supporters of the NRPR are not members of Veblen's "moderately well-to-do" class, but there is a new class of "half-idle" people in America who may well be candidates for membership in the NRPR organizations. Most visible are older, retired people living on modest pensions. Many of these are traditionally "devout," and have ample time to listen to TV ministers.</page><page sequence="19">Veblen and Christianity 1173 They may be even more alienated that the "moderately well-to-do" by modern technology and rapid social changes, feeling left out and alone, and constantly worrying about their economic and physical security. Rather than such "half-idle" people turning to the exotic "occult" cults as did the well-to-do in Veblen's day, these people are much more likely to respond to the NRPR's message of traditionalism and authoritarianism as a means of keeping change under control and within the realm of hu- man understanding. Some Concluding Comments In this article, we have offered a generalized "Veblenian" perspective on only the two polar cases of contemporary social-political activism by Christian groups. If time had permitted, several other cases of Christian social-political activism should have been included, for example, the role of the Catholic Church in Poland, the controversy over the alleged "left- wing" social-political activities of the National Council of Churches, the sanctuary movement, which involves a number of U.S. churches provid- ing aid to illegal refugees from El Salvador, and the U.S. Catholic Bishops' letter on nuclear destruction. On a broader front, moving away from the narrow focus on Christianity, a Veblenian perspective on the Iranian Islamic revolution under the Ayatollah Khomeini regime would be most interesting. Finally, we have made no attempt to investigate the possible sources of Veblen's vision of a natural Christianity, which may reflect to some extent Edward Bellamy's influence. Nor were we able to explore the link between Veblen's "Christian morals" and the "non-invidious interest" discussed in The Theory of the Leisure Class. Notes 1.
