<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL GARELLI The Changing Facets of Conservative Mesopotamian Thought There is no need to emphasize once more the importance of Israelite monotheism in the evolution of human thought. Three living religious movements?Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?have drawn the essence of their doctrine from it. And one might even add that it strongly influenced Western forms of atheism, through their reaction to it. But this monotheistic idea was born and developed surrounded by trends that were quite the opposite. If the intellectual of today wants to understand how such a mutation could be produced, he has to turn to the history of the ancient Near East. Sumer, Assur, Babylon are not simply names maintained to satisfy the curiosity of the scholar; they collectively represent the history that first saw the appearance of the monotheistic revolution, and they explain the forms that it took. These are analyzed in greater detail in this volume by V. Nikiprowetzky, who shows how this trend is directly connected to the political history of the people of Israel, and?what is no less important?the way in which Western scholars have interpreted the matter. My intention here is to separate out certain basic tendencies of the Assyro Babylonian religion that constituted the background for its development. At the same time, we shall see that the mode of thought of Eastern priests would not have en couraged the development of rationalism, but this situation in itself is very instruc tive. It allows us to measure the scope of the idea of transcendence, as well as what Western man owes to Greece. Still it might be useful to make clear first what we mean by "Assyro-Babylonian religion'' and to what extent we can speak of such a religion. On several occasions A. Leo Oppenheim argued for a complete revision of the currently accepted concep tions; he stressed the diversity of Mesopotamian religious manifestations and the necessity for studying them separately before any general synthesis could be reached. There was a need to study: . . . the religion of the theologians, that of the king and his court, of the city dweller, of the farmer, on one hand, those of the south and the north, of the peripheral regions, the plains, the piedmont tracts on the other, those of the small decaying cities, the prosperous capitals, the powerful temples, etc.1 Directing himself once again, in Ancient Mesopotamia, to the diversity in the "intellectual and spiritual dimensions" that separate polytheistic from monotheistic religions, Oppenheim wrote: It is open to serious doubt whether we will ever be able to cross the gap caused by the difference in "dimensions." This conceptual barrier, in fact, is more serious an impediment than the 47</page><page sequence="2">48 PAUL GARELLI reason usually given, the lack of data and specific informations. Even if more material were preserved, and that in an ideal distribution in content, period, and locale, no real insight would be forthcoming?only more problems.2 Jean Nougayrol is not so resigned or pessimistic: "Such an objection in principle to any overall view," he writes, "is rather polemical in nature: it aims at establishing new methods of work. The essential unity of the Babylonian religion cannot be called into question."3 It is not that Nougayrol wishes to deny the identity of certain religious manifestations: the religion of Assyria always maintains its distinction, despite the influence of Babylonian religious thought which pervaded Assyria very early, in the pre-eminence of Ashur, and the sacerdotal functions that the king, his terrestrial vicar, personally performs. ... In Babylonia itself, one can attribute specific traits to certain local cults. . . . Certain specialized priests chose particular gods in limited sections of the pantheon to whom they could most readily address themselves. In this sense, there existed "theologies" of the soothsayer, of the magician, of the "cantor."4 But, according to him, these peculiarities do not detract from the fundamental character of the Assyro-Babylonian religion: its tendency to remain static. The fact is that the pantheon discovered in a canonical series from the library of Assurbanipal (669-630 B.C.) still reflects that of the Sumerian world, which had not been a living reality since 2000 B.C. The text apparently leaves no place for Assur, the god of the empire, and Marduk, great master of prestigious Babylon, is modestly situated in the wake of his father Enki. The Sumerian pantheon remained in a posi tion of honor until the end of the empires. If their names were at times "Babylonized," the attributes of the great gods were reflected in the Sumerian pronunciations: An (or Ami) is the god of the heavens; Enlil, the god of the air and of the earth; Enki (or Ea), the god of the waters of the abyss upon which the world floats. The luminous deities, venerated by all the Semitic peoples?Sin, the moon; Shamash, the sun; Ishtar, the planet Venus; and Adad, the lightning?had their Sumerian equivalents in Nanna, Utu, Inanna, and Ishkur. If one can discern a certain propensi ty to use the Semitic names, the importance accorded these gods was no less consis tent with the traditional order. However, respect for the Sumerian canon did not prevent promotion to the high est rank of those deities who originally had only occupied subordinate positions, or even were alien to this tradition. This was the case with Assur, who was assimilated with Enlil. In Babylonia, Marduk also received supreme honors, and his son Nabu had an extraordinary vogue in all of Mesopotamia, starting in the ninth century. In this respect, Assyrians and Babylonians only followed a tendency witnessed since the Sumerian era, where one finds Enlil usurping the prerogatives of An. The phenomenon was not, of course, peculiar to Mesopotamia. The history of religions is well acquainted with the fading away of sovereign but distant figures in favor of younger and more dynamic personalities. The only feature that is perhaps more specifically Mesopotamian is the conjunction of this universal tendency with the ascension of a national god. This is even true of Enlil, who was the god of Nippur, the coronation city of Sumer, and even more true of Marduk and Assur. The case of Nabu is more debatable, because one cannot readily see the reason that could have militated in favor of such a choice, unless it is the promotion of a "god-son." The ex perience, supposing that it is accurately outlined, was cut short by the Persian inva</page><page sequence="3">CONSERVATIVE MESOPOTAMIAN THOUGHT 49 sion and the dismantling of the empires. It still remains true that these promotions, counter to the official canon, were also in conformance with Sumerian tradition. But caution is essential: this conclusion only reintroduces the absence of change through phenomena of ruptures; one risks exaggerating the Sumerian influence. Certainly, this influence was considerable. Apart from the facts cited, one cannot leave unmentioned the general disposition of the temples, which easily allow the Sumerian prototypes to be seen beneath their subsequent expansions: the celia that shelters the divine statue, opening onto a courtyard, surrrounded by the repositories and by the private chambers. From this very fact one can deduce the permanence of a ceremonial order, and we know that Sumerian remained the liturgical language in the Assyro-Babylonian sanctuaries. The penitential psalms were composed in Sumerian dialect with an interlinear translation in Akkadian. Also of Sumerian inspiration were a great number of literary forms, such as the royal inscriptions, the "wisdoms," and the incantations. Finally, should not the Sumerian origin of legendary heros such as Gilgamesh or Etana be recalled?5 However, to speak of borrowing and of inspiration implies a recognition of an evolution, and we have made an effort to point out the divergent particularities of the Sumerian and Akkadian modes of thought. The formal differences are striking: a more pronounced tendency toward lyricism in the Sumerian compositions, a taste for repetition that can reach monotony, little sympathy for explanation and synthesis. More basically, one must emphasize in the Semitic universe the abyss separating the human from the divine, the accent placed on personal piety, individual responsibility, and, correlatively, the awareness of sin.6 But it is difficult not to see, in this outline of a divine transcendence, a reflection of the evolution of kingship, and one is compelled to ask, as a result, whether it is wise to allow the ethnic factor to intervene.7 The long held idea of a struggle between the Sumerian and Akkadian elements of the popula tion of lower Iraq has been rejected.8 The Sumero-Akkadian symbiosis had already been accomplished when the Semitic peoples unified Mesopotamia, and the peculiarities pointed out above give rise to another interpretation: they could only find expression in a temporal gap separating periods of creativity in one and the same civilization. The one that blossomed in the land of Sumer would be the first manifestation of this; the Babylonia of later ages knew others of equal importance. The Old Babylonian period (ca. 2000-1600 B.C.) was particularly prolific. The majority of the great myths?Anzu, Atrahasis, Etana, a new version of Gilgamesh?date back to this period, and it is not impossible that other compositions, such as Adapa or Mergal and Ereshkigal, known by later texts, can be assigned to this time. It is also during this period that one finds taking shape the penitential psalms, the religious and magical rituals, the first inquiries into the suffering of the just, and, above all, the enormous divinatory corpus; the latter springs up suddenly, already provided with its basic methods, and with no apparent Sumerian influence.9 This period, whose importance from the economic and social point of view F. R. Kraus has also emphasized,10 was able to collect all that had been acquired and to ex tract from it those forms that were to become predominant until the end of the em pires. In comparison, one tends to minimize the later contributions. However, they were not negligible, if it is true that the Babylonian poem of the creation, the Enuma elish, dates to the Kassite age (1600-1200 B.C.). The Aramean invasions and their succ?s</page><page sequence="4">50 PAUL GARELLI sion of devastations are at the root of the epic poem of Era. Even Assyria made in novations in its turn with "the judgment of Marduk" and "the infernal vision," ap parently composed under the reigns of Sennacherib and of Assarhaddon (704-669 B.C.). But that is not the main point; it lies in the efforts at compilation and thought spurred by the evils of the times. The scribes made an effort to save the cultural heritage from the disasters of the invasions. Undoubtedly, their knowledge may seem somewhat academic. Their style, copied from that of the works of the past, is artificial. But they transmitted the heritage while enriching it. They reflected on the human condition, while grappling again with the problem of evil, with rational demands un known until then. But respect for the past prevented them from giving up the ancestral practices. They themselves, since the ninth century and, undoubtedly, even since the Kassite period, were priests in service to the temples.11 An appreciable number of literary and religious works, such as "The Exaltation of Ishtar" and the "Epic of Gilgamesh," are attributed by a catalogue of authors to the writers of laments and of incantations. At most, they gave new significance to magical practices: they became a means placed by the gods at the disposal of the individual, which protected his freedom of action; they were not abandoned. And it is highly symp tomatic, in this regard, to note that it is a magician who composed the "Theodicy" in which the demands of rationality are most forcefully asserted. Magic and Reason could apparently live together without conflict in the same individual. On the other hand, one must not forget that these priests, by their very functions, were little inclined to abstraction. Their role was not to speculate on the nature of the world and of the human spirit: it was to assure the continuity of Tradition. Therein lay their duty, just as others had been made responsible for the continued running of public affairs and the administration of the provinces. They were all, ultimately, in the service of the prince, who demanded absolute obedience, that is, the unfailing dis charge of the duty assigned to each. This conception is most obvious in Assyria, where the royal authority had a greater hold over the mass of its subjects than it did in Babylonia. However, it is no less evident in that country. But such habits of subor dination did not favor free discussion and, in Mesopotamia, we do not find an awaken ing of rational philosophy. One can discern there some changes in the interpretation of traditional beliefs, which accumulate without being suppressed. If this attitude reinforced irrational tendencies, it also did not exclude a great flexibility of mind. But this developed on another level: the interplay of symbols and connections. At first glance the Assyro-Babylonian pantheon seems rather clearly ordered, and one could place its members in a few broad categories, without really betraying the thought of the ancient compilers: gods of the world, astral deities, gods of nature, national gods.12 Each one of them has his own specific domain, his family, his court, his place of worship. They all reveal anthropomorphic traits, which allow us to dis tinguish certain distinct personalities: Enlil is a brutal master, often hostile to men; Sin, a venerable and good old man; Shamash, a judge with a piercing look; Ishtar, a passionate and sometimes cruel lover. But these traits are not revealed to the point where they do not allow fusions or confusions. Ishtar wound up supplanting all the primitive goddesses by monopolizing the attributes of femininity. The exclusive demands of piety gave the characteristics of other deities to the patron of a local sanc tuary, to the point that at times it is difficult to know to whom a prayer is addressed if the incipit has been lost. The national gods benefited particularly from this favored</page><page sequence="5">CONSERVATIVE MESOPOTAMIAN THOUGHT 51 treatment as is evidenced by the well-known invocation to Marduk: Sin is thy divinity, Ami thy principality, Dagan thy lordship, Enlil thy royalty, Adad thy courage, Ea the Wise thy understanding. . . . All the gods enumerated thus became aspects or attributes of the principal god. But other deities, who never benefited from absolute primacy, nonetheless enjoyed the same favored treatment. Praises addressed to Ninurta make each god and even the universe parts of his body. Nougayrol rightly refuses to distinguish in these equations a rough form of monotheism, as has sometimes been maintained. As we have already indicated, the Mesopotamian system was actually poles apart from monotheism, and what follows will show that it could not possibly have led to it. But is not one rein trod ucing the same hypothesis by suspecting "a sort of impatience with poly theism" in these "games"?13 In fact these portraits are neither "games" nor simple "exercises in style." The same processes are used in any circumstance where human anguish breaks through. A man threatened by a spell will not hesitate to identify with the gods and the universe in order to cast off the evil spirit. He proclaims: Enlil is my head, the day is my face, Urash, the perfect god, is my guardian spirit; my neck is Ninlil's necklace, my arm, the crescent of western Sin. I am the skies, thou canst not touch me, I am the earth, thou canst not swallow me. The poor man knows well that he is neither god nor sky nor earth. But he assumes the strength evoked by these words, thanks to the power of the ritual performed under the required conditions. He is then all of these things. These texts are by nature heterogeneous; since some are excerpts from hymns, while others are magical rituals, it is all the more remarkable to note the resemblance of the identifications invoked. Even if one only cares to see simple metaphors in them, they nonetheless present the same conception: the universe forms a whole in which the divine manifests itself. The earth can be as evocative of this diffuse power as the sky or the personality of a particular god. They are like mirrors that infinitely reflect the diversity of the Being with which man seeks to identify himself. And this is possi ble, not in a Beyond, abolisher of Time, but in the present instant, by virtue of the ritual that allows the actualization of profound meanings. In reality there is no insurmountable barrier between beings, the gods, and the universe. The Babylonian poem of the creation, the Enuma elish, develops the same idea when it assigns a common origin to them all: the gods issued forth from the primeval couple Apsu and Tiamat, the fresh water and the sea. And when Tiamat, wanting to annihilate her descendants, is shared by Marduk, half of her body forms the earth, the other half the celestial vault. From the blood of Kingu, leader of the conquered army, humanity is formed. These beliefs apparently did not constitute the basis for the identification of the hymns and rituals. They were not dogma, and different cosmogonies are known. But the Enuma elish is the most complete; it im</page><page sequence="6">52 PAUL GARELLI posed itself on Babylon and Assyria, where the figure of Assur replaced that of Mar duk without undergoing any changes. For this reason, the poem of the creation deserves particular attention, and it is interesting to note that its author, in a different literary genre, follows the same presuppositions as did the authors of the hymns and of the magical rituals. It is this conception that allows us to understand the continual mingling of religious and magical attitudes. Nothing illustrates this better than the ritual of the New Year.14 This ritual has not come down to us in its entirety. Only the details of the ceremonies for the second through the fifth days are known; however, they are sufficient to illustrate the basic tendencies. On the second day of the month of Nisan, two hours before daybreak, the custodian of the holy place, after washing in the waters of the river, addresses a prayer to Marduk in which the theme of the unity of the cosmos appears: Bel, Babylon is thy throne, Borsippa is thy tiara, the vast heavens are the whole of thy body. . . 15 The holy cities and the entire universe, which constitute the substance or the insignia of his sovereignty, will share in the exaltation of the god. It should be noted that the skies are Marduk's body, while in the Enuma elish, recited two days later by the same officiating priest, one half of the skies, or at least of the celestial vault, is formed by the body of Tiamat. Obviously, logical organization does not interfere in a system where the interplay of relationships depends on what is intended at the moment. The third day is dedicated to the preparation of figurines that embody the forces of evil and will be decapitated and burned. We are now in the realm of pure exorcism. The statuettes are minutely described: "One holds a serpent made out of cedar wood in its left hand and raises its right hand against Nabu. The other holds a scorpion in its left hand and raises its right hand against Nabu." Dressed in red, the color of death, they will await their fate in the chapel of the "divine judge.'' It is on the fourth day that the beginning of the renewal takes place. After the prayers of supplication and an invocation to the constellation of Babylon, the star Iku (identified with his temple, the Esagil, "image of the sky and of the earth"), the custo dian recites the Enuma elish. During this recital, "the front of Ami's tiara and Enlil's throne remain covered." The exaltation of Marduk produces, therefore, an eclipse of the supreme gods, while it allows for the actualization of his directing gesture. The temples will return to their initial purity and the king will be reinvested with his functions. These ceremonies occupy the fifth day and they follow the same procedures of sympathetic magic and symbolic gesture as those of the preceding days: a ram is killed, which will serve as substitute for the impurities of the temple. The sanctuary is smeared with its blood, then the corpse is thrown into the river "facing West," that is, it is sent to hell. The two executors, the magician and the sword-bearer, contaminated by the impurities, withdraw to the countryside, so as not to pollute the sanctuary. For the same reasons, the custodian is not present during the purification. In this restored temple, kingship will be renewed. The sovereign is stripped of his insignia, his scepter, his circle, scimitar and tiara, which the custodian places in front of Bel. Kingship thus has reascended to the heavens from whence it originally came. It will descend again once the king, humiliated by a slap in the face, has proved his in nocence by enumerating the duties of his office that he has observed: respect for the</page><page sequence="7">CONSERVATIVE MESOPOTAMIAN THOUGHT 53 deity, for the city of Babylon, for its temple, and for the freedoms of its citizens. The custodian then returns his insignia to him and slaps him again, but this gesture does not have the same meaning as the earlier one; it reveals the divine will: If his tears come, Bel is well disposed; If his tears do not come, Bel is angry; The enemy will rise up and cause his fall. Here the omen link is not clear. Perhaps it refers to a fertility rite, where the tears an nounce the rain. The end of the ritual, for which we have no evidence, must have been dedicated to the preparation of the procession of the Akitu, to the determination by Marduk of the fortunes for the year, to the celebration of his marriage with the goddess Sarpanitum. It is sufficient to read a ritual of this type to see the fundamental significance of the system of relationships. The temple, which is the image of the universe, is reflected in the constellation of Babylon, and the city itself is a part of Marduk's body. What is in volved here is an interplay of cosmic forces, whose balance is assured by the king, rep resenting the god on earth. The development of astrology during the first millennium becomes understandable under these circumstances. One can also understand how an expert, who removes himself from spatial and temporal dimensions, can easily worship the statue constructed according to his directions in the temple's workshop. For, by the ceremony of the "mouth washing," appearances are abolished; only the world of meanings remains. And the food offered to the idol truly becomes a source of life. This the Hebrews could not understand, and their sarcastic remarks about it still inhibit the clear understanding of these practices. It should also be kept in mind that the New Year ceremonies, which must have been of fundamental importance since they insured the equilibrium of the temporal cycle, were not public, except, of course, in their final phase, during the procession of the Akitu. The same was true for the other rituals that have come down to us: the peo ple were excluded from the ceremonies except at certain specified times during their closing moments. From this, one begins to wonder what the religious activity of the individual was. Perhaps, paradoxically, not much: some prayers?we do not know if they were even daily prayers?some oracular petitions, some apotropaic incantations, a few propitiatory offerings. The rest and the most important?providing for the god, the celebration of feasts, the observance of the rites essential to the prosperity of the country?were performed without the participation of the populace. It was the business of the "specialists" and, occasionally, of the representative of the communi ty, that is, the king. It is from the heart of the community, but almost unbeknownst to it, that the divine benediction radiated. None of them could break with such prac tices: the king because he was only the guarantor of an order that depended on them; the people because they believed they benefited from them, without participating directly; the priests because their entire education pushed them into preserving what they had acquired, and what, moreover, appeared to be a fount of inexhaustible knowledge. It is this infinite perspective of relationships revealing the depth of ex istence?we have only to recall the exegesis on the fifty names of Marduk in the Enuma elish?that must have represented all of the richness of their religion in the eyes of the initiated. To some extent, Hinduism allows us to understand the fervor of this attitude.</page><page sequence="8">54 PAUL GARELLI However, one king, Nabonidus, the last sovereign of an independent Babylonia, attempted innovations. But we must measure the extent of this attempt and of its failure. The information we have on the subject is both biased and incomplete. It is derived from a scurrilous satire propagated by the priests of Babylon, who accused the king of wanting to impose a heterodox cult of the moon god, and who, because of this, looked favorably upon Cyrus. There is no doubt that Nabonidus, the son of a priestess of the god Sin at Harran, had nourished a devotion for the god that bordered on fanaticism. He particularly honored the lunar centers of Ur and of Harran and, in the latter city, he rebuilt the temple of the Ehulhul, despite strong Babylonian opposition. The king then retired to Teima in Arabia, another lunar center; and there is no discern ible political or economic justification for such a decision. But Nabonidus never dreamed of imposing an exclusive cult of the god Sin who was, in his eyes, only the greatest of the deities. His inscriptions bear this out; what he was criticized for was in terfering with the rites. This crisis reveals the basic propensities of the Babylonian mind. Neither party involved justified its position by rational argument. For that reason, the monarch's piety did not clear the way for a monotheistic revolution; it was no more than a form of henotheism. And his adversaries, who were not predisposed to logical discussion, responded with an abusive pamphlet: the god Sin of this document is nothing but a monster bearing no resemblance to the deity in Nabonidus' inscrip tions. The fall of Babylon in 539 B.C. put an end to the controversy, and the Babylo nian priests imperturbably pursued their ancestral duties. Some centers were still devoted to these in the first century before our era. As a matter of fact, when one sees the terms in which the dispute between Nabonidus and the clergy of Babylon was stated, the intervention of Cyrus seems of rather minor importance. The crisis could have been overcome through the prodigious assimilative abilities of Mesopotamian scholars, as had undoubtedly been done on other occasions about which we are less well informed. Erica Reiner has remarked that the myth of the Seven Sages seems to have undergone the effects of a censure,16 and the declarations of Nabonidus do not seem any more daring than those of an eighth-century prefect of Calab, when he declared: "Place thy trust in Nabu. Have faith in no other god." At this point, one must bear in mind Oppenheims view of polytheistic religions: "They are characterized by the absence of any centrali ty and by a deep-seated tolerance to shifting stresses, making possible the adaptability that such religions need to achieve their millennial lifespan."17 The enormous cuneiform documentation, accumulated over four millennia, confirms this view. The Sumerian impetus was decisive, and whatever followed could only alter, not abolish it. Consequently, one question cannot be avoided: What factors caused such different results to be produced in Mesopotamia and in Israel? One cannot invoke ethnic factors or intellectual capacities. The ancestors of the Israelites were polytheistic nomads, who wandered in the same regions as the racially related Akka dian tribes. Monotheism was born much later, after they had settled in Canaan, and it took the form of denying foreign beliefs in order to preserve a national identity. One could conceive of the Akkadian nomads acting in the same manner and for the same reasons. But they were not isolated in a mountainous hinterland; they were scattered throughout the fertile plains and on the outskirts of the Sumerian cities, which appeared to them as so many fascinating centers of culture. For them, the acquisition</page><page sequence="9">CONSERVATIVE MESOPOTAMIAN THOUGHT 55 of a national identity coincided with the unification of these centers whose system of values they recognized. Afterwards, it was too late: to preserve the national identity was to preserve what they had acquired, that is, the fusion of their own traditions with the Sumerian inheritance. At the time when the Sumerian cities were still indepen dent, phenomena of repudiation and of separation were inconceivable, because their struggles for supremacy in no way implied the rejection of their respective cults. The period of slow maturation of the tribes of Israel in a relatively isolated area was perhaps that "little nothing" that explains everything. The God of their forefathers watched for his chances after the conquest, and history very quickly assumed a religious dimension. However, neither in Mesopotamia nor in Israel does one see the birth of genuine rationalism, nor was it through logical reflection that the Hebrews eliminated polytheism It could not have been otherwise when one considers that the Orient did not know, as Greece did, political institutions with egalitarian tendencies that en couraged free discussion. On the contrary, the constant strengthening of monarchal despotism developed a hierarchical system of subordination. The phenomenon is par ticularly striking in Mesopotamia, but it ended by spreading over into the Syro Palestinian regions. What developed in these areas was a feeling of divine transcendence, reinforced by the development of the political ideology, which the vicissitudes of history have placed in Israel in one single divine being.
