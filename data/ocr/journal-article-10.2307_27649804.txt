<plain_text><page sequence="1">DONNA J. HARAWAY'S WHEN SPECIES MEET, VOLUME 3 OF POSTHUMANITIES, EDITED BY CARY WOLFE, MINNEAPOLIS: UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA PRESS, 2008 MANUELA ROSSINI Meet a true alpha bitch and her human and nonhuman companions. Messmates at table and partners in play, they run fast along the high-speed train of biotechnological evolution, they bite hard at rampant global cap italism, and they risk alien encounters likely to cause pain and indigestion when face to face with incommensurable differences and asymmetrical power. The complexities and contradictions of living and dying in the age of technoscience are not easy to stomach, but that is no excuse for not chewing at them as responsively, politely, and gracefully as possible. Call it a commitment to queer cosmopolitics, an ethics of cross-species flourishing, or sf (science fiction) other-worlding in order to nourish a viable future for animals and human critters alike. In When Species Meet, Donna Haraway shares various ways of doings so, lessons she learned herself about eight years ago, when her hand shook the paw of Cayenne, an individual of the Australian Shepherd breed. The insights and Web sites; the informative, evocative and provocative, personal-political, sad, and humorous stories; and the variety of species herded into the covers of this book are the consequences of that touch. Through touching, living creatures inherit each other's histories in the flesh and in logic. True to her heritage as the daughter of a sportswriter, Haraway writes about the game of co-constitutive entanglement across machinic, animal, and human species. When species meet, they do not come together as fixed units. Rather, all participants are becoming with each other in "a subject- and object-shaping dance of encounters" (4). Part 1 (making up half of the book), "We Have Never Been Human," contains a strong antidose against "human expectionalism," the virus that severs the ties between humankind and all other kinds on the basis of some features unique to the former. Instead, Haraway invites us to see the human as just another knot in the worldwide web of interspecies dependencies, as always already m-formed by organic and technological nonhumans. The term she proposes for all these old, new, and yet-to-(be) come "mixed breeds" is "companion species," offered as an alternative [WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly 36: 3 &amp; 4 (Fall/Winter 2008)] ? 2008 by Manuela Rossini.

Foregrounding processes of optic-haptic relating and adding "encoun ter value" to the Marxian values of use and exchange in relations of labor and capital, a companion-species approach starts from the premise that "all mortal beings...live in and through the use of one another's bodies" (79) and are hence reciprocally means and ends to each other. In other words, instrumentality should be thought outside the dualistic taxono mies of master/slave, powerful/powerless, free/unfree, active/passive? even though it cannot be denied that pain and suffering is distributed extremely unevenly between human and nonhuman animals. Living within the same instrumental economy, Haraway continues, in her care fully written chapter on experimental lab practices, human beings should learn how to share that suffering in nonmimetic ways, namely, not by taking the place of the animal victim but by understanding what the ani mal is going through in order to get this unequal relationship and power structure right?emotionally, intellectually, ethically, and operationally. Part 2, "Notes of a Sportswriter's Daughter," tells the most intimate and touching accounts in the book of what can happen in specific contact zones where different species share the same working conditions. The love letters and e-mails assembled here speak of the love and friendship between a father and a daughter and between a woman and a dog beyond the framework of the Oedipal family romance, anthropocentrism, or anthropomorphism. They speak of the love of team sports (baseball, agil ity) whereby the partners transform themselves as they are engaged in it and are provoked into unexpected emotions and behavior that compli cate preconceived understandings of domestication, pleasure, authority, and much else. And, not least of all, they speak of the love of writing to script fuller lives. Moreover, the encounters and practices describe how a body is always under (de)construction and reconstruction, never alone but always becoming-with other bodies, that is, constituted in relating. When her father, Frank , died on September 29, 2005, the knots to the living bodies with whom he had related flesh to flesh became undone, but by writing about him, his daughter, Donna, found a responsive way of re-membering him.</page><page sequence="3">ROSSINI 311 Part 3, "Tangled Species," takes a dive into the ocean to introduce us to more "wild" critters there and to cast a different eye on the world? metaphorically and literally, by not only "compounding eyes" but also compounding the human "I," turning s/he into a companion-species "we": to provide material for the Crittercam TV show, humans attach cameras on marine animals and thereby mingle living and nonliving agents into a multispecies hermeneutics. When following Chicken Little around the globe, our eyes are opened to the shocking realities of illegal trafficking in animals and the massive exploitation not only of avian but also human workers in the poultry industry while we are also being presented with a paradigmatic example of a chicken-human encounter that promises the future well-being ofboth species. And yet, as the intertwined narratives about "educating" feral cats and community college students in Sonoma County, California, make us see, becoming-with-companions in technoculture is full of contingencies, neither easy to play "fair" for the human beings nor simply good or bad for the animals in the game. Perhaps bit(e)s of the food for thought and action of When Species Meet won't go down well with some animal rights activists or some ecofeminists. Significantly, I think, Haraway ends the book with the story of how when she came to Santa Cruz in 1980 for a job interview she got m touch with a community whose members have nourished her "world liness" ever since, raising her cosmopolitical consciousness through meet ings in which people responded to seriously different truth claims m respectful, albeit noncompromising, ways. Coming to the same table from different standpoints and breaking bread together ("companion" is from the Latin cumpanis) often means conflict but it also offers opportuni ties for alliances across diverse gulfs to work toward a more liveable and just world in companionship with other human and nonhuman bodies. Nothing less than getting on together is at stake.
