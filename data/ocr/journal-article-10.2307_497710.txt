GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Geographical Method in Prehistorical Study.-P. DEFFONTAINES urges the necessity of applying geography to prehistoric study. Differences of place, surroundings, climate, flora and fauna, and the like are quite as im- portant as differences of date, and without careful study of geography the two are likely to be confused. (R. 4rch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 171-175.) Phoenicians, Aegeans, and Hellenes.-The races which shared in the primitive Mediterranean culture are the subject of a recent discussion by RAYMOND WEILL (Syria, II, 1921, pp. 120-144). The "Phoenicians" of this period are not the Semitic people of the Syrian coast who bore this name in classical times; they are the Aegeo-Cretan people who dominated the islands and coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean, including that Syrian littoral which afterwards by a gradual limitation of geographical nomenclature, came to be known as Phoenicia. In Egypt the name Kefto underwent a precisely similar change of meaning. The Aegean civilization established on the Syrian coast was not penetrative; it did not change the originally Semitic racial and linguistic characteristics of the Canaanitish population. But the Poulousati mentioned in Egyptian documents, the Philistines of the Bible, were an Aegean people. An examination of the names of the "People of the Sea" mentioned in inscriptions of Rameses II and his successors shows that most of the nations mentioned belong to Asia Minor. The Akaiouasha seem also to have been an Asiatic people, probably Carians. It was these people whose occupation of Greece is reflected in such myths of Oriental immigration as those associated with Inachus, Danaus, and Pelops. These Asiatic Achaeans were supplanted by Hellenic invaders who took over the civilization and traditions, and even the name, it would seem, of the primitive Carian Achaeans. Landscape in Ancient Painting.-R. PAGENSTECHER (Jb. Ki. Alt. XLVII- XLVIII, 1921, pp. 271-288) outlines the history of landscape painting in Greece and Rome. In view of the considerable appreciation of nature found 1 The departments of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archae- ological Books are conducted by Professor DEANE, Editor-in-charge, assisted by Professor SAMUEL E.

XXVI, 1922 in the Greek poets, even in the tragic drama, the neglect of man's natural environment in Greek painting is noteworthy. Due in part to the recognized humanistic tendency of the Greek mind, and to the anthropomorphic reaction of the Greek imagination to the forces of nature, this limitation is also inherent in the function of the monumental arts as practised in the classical period. The subjects of decoration normally chosen for pediment groups and for great mural paintings require almost exclusively the portrayal of human figures. Pre-Hellenic art is contrasted with Greek in the extent to which interest in human subjects is subordinated to that of the world in which they live: its animal, floral, and marine life. In the Geometric period the characteristic restriction of early Greek painting to human subjects is already manifest; and even the landscape elements which, under the influence of oriental models, appear so often in Ionian art, are usually rejected by Attic painters, whose concentrated humanism is in its severest form coincident with the period of the Persian wars. The invention of the red-figure technique in vase painting favored the development of this strictly monumental style, excluding land- scape accessories. A similar tendency is reflected in the mural painting of Polygnotus. His adoption of the representation of irregularities of ground at different levels is not due to interest in landscape: it is the solution of a problem of composition, the covering of wide and high wall spaces with human figures. More progress in the direction of landscape painting was made in theatre backgrounds, but Polygnotus did not avail himself of this. With the Pelopon- nesian War the dominance of Athens in the arts passed, and in Sicily and Southern Italy there are evidences of a development of painting which gave more attention to landscape. The scene on the Ficoroni cista is a copy from some painting of this style, made perhaps at Tarentum. The extension of Greek acquaintance with the world through the conquests of Alexander, and the sight of oriental parks and villas planned for the enjoyment of natural surroundings turned the attention of the Hellenistic Greeks to landscape as a motive in art. The growth of great cities also had its reaction in a sentimental enthusiasm for nature which found its literary expression in the idyls of Theocritus. Monumental painting was in a stage of decline; the small panel pictures demanded for the decoration of private houses lent themselves to the expression of the new interest in landscape. In the development of this motive Alexandria played a leading part. This accounts for the Egyptian subjects so often found in Pompeian wall painting. The later styles of Pompeian decoration aim at an architectural breaking-up of the wall-space, allowing glimpses of landscape. The panels which originated in the oriental Greek world are enlarged in the Roman period to pictures in which the human figures are distinctly subordinate. "Contours and drawing dissolve in colors and light; the purely corporeal, plastic view is overcome; painting has entered on its own province." The Roman painter Ludius seems to have been an im- portant figure in this development of landscape painting. According to Petronius Alexandrian art is to be credited with the invention of compendiaria, illusionistic or impressionistic devices which are exemplified in Pompeian work. Byzantine painting is marked by a complete reaction from this free, impression- istic style in favor of stiff and severe drawing and contour. Landscape vanishes, and art returns to a geometric type in harmony with its religious purpose and its architectural function.</page><page sequence="3">Misc.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 195 The Signum Salamonis.-J. L. DE VASCONCELOS has published a detailed study of the signum Salamonis, the five-pointed or six-pointed star, in the superstition, folk-lore and art of Eastern and European peoples, ancient and modern. (O Archeologo Portuguis, XXIII, 1918, pp. 203-316; 240 figs.) Tattooing in Morocco.-J. HERBER discusses the persistence of tattooing among the Arabo-Berbers of Morocco, perpetuated by local tradition in op- position to the law of Islam. (R. Hist. Rel. LXXXIII, 1921, pp. 69-83.) The Symbolism of Lizards and Frogs.-W. DEONNA maintains that certain Italian plastic vases showing a saurian devouring a boy are not of genre motive, but have a mystic significance. The lizard typifies the death which devours the body. Other animals have a similar r61e in various works of classical and mediaeval art. Legend also associates the toad or frog with the lizard in this symbolism of death. On the other hand both lizard and frog have a celestial as well as an infernal meaning, derived from ancient Egyptian religion. The frog is a symbol of immortality; the lizard of the sun. That the two sometimes appeared together in ancient art is indirectly attested by Pliny's story of the architects Sauros and Batrachos. Probably the relief which Pliny describes as a punning signature of two artists was really of symbolic meaning. The existence of the artists was an invention parallel to the story that Phidias portrayed himself on the shield of the Athena Parthenos. (R. tt. Gr. XXXII, 1919, pp. 132-148; 2 figs.) Sostratus of Cnidus and the Virtue of Invisible Formulae.-W. DEONNA (R. Arch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 175-178) recalls the story (Lucian, w$ ~5e tcropiav uvoyypiewv, 62) that Sostratus, the architect of the Pharos at Alex- andria, inscribed his dedication on the stone of the building, then covered it with a coating in which the king's name was inscribed. Such action may, it is here suggested, have been inspired by the belief in the magic virtue of hidden writings, etc. Such a belief has existed through the ages. It may explain the fact that prehistoric paintings in caves are in their darkest recesses. Many examples of hidden writings, etc., are given. The Mus6e Guimet.-The first number of a new archaeological publication, the Bulletin Archdologique du Musie Guimet, Fasc. I (pp. 1-72; 4 pls.; Paris and Brussels, 1921, Van Oest) is devoted to the Salle Edouard Chavannes of the Mus~e Guimet. P. PELLIOT contributes a biographical sketch of Chavannes, S. LEVI an estimate of his contribution to Indian studies. H. D'ARDENNE characterizes and compares three leaders of archaeological research in China:. Chavannes, Petrucci, and Segalen, and PAUL VITRY has a separate essay on Segalen. The results of the expedition conducted by Chavannes in North China in 1907, of Segalen's expedition in Western China in 1914, and of the expedition conducted by Segalen and others in the region of Nankin in 1917 are described by J. LARTIGUE. A list of photographic negatives made by the last two expeditions is appended. Ibid. Fasc. II, 1921, pp. 1-38 (4 pls.) an account by P. PELLIOT of his expedition in 1908 to Chinese Turkestan is followed by a list of the Buddhist sculptures and paintings obtained by this expedition for the Mus6e Guimet, written by J. HACKIN. J. HACKIN also describes the pottery fragments from Yotkan now in the Musde Guimet. These were obtained by the Mission Scientifique de Haute-Asie (1890-1895) conducted by J. L. Dutreuil de Rhins. A note by J. BACOT, explaining the lack of archaeological material in Tibet, where he travelled in 1907 and 1909, is followed by a detailed description, 6</page><page sequence="4">196 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 written by J. HACKIN, of five Tibetan Buddhist paintings acquired by M. Bacot in his travels, and now in the Mus~e Guimet. Borneo Shields.-NENoZO UTSURIKAWA suggests that the demon design common on shields of Borneo tribes, although it, perhaps, has historical con- nection with Hindu-Javanese ornament, has been modified by native imitation of simian forms. (Am. Anthr. XXIII, 1921, pp. 138-148; 3 figs.) EGYPT Egyptian Remains at Byblos.-M. MONTET, after calling attention to the im- portance of Byblos to Egypt as the port through which the Egyptians were supplied with timber and resin, describes a few hieroglyphic inscriptions which have been found there and points out the probability that further discoveries of Egyptian objects would reward excavation on this site: (C. R. Acad. Insc. 1921, pp. 158-168; 7 figs.) A Receipt of the XXIId Dynasty.-G. MOLLER publishes a receipt for the payment of a loan, attested by six witnesses, which was discovered on the backs of leaves 10 and 11 of Hieratic Papyrus 3048 in the Berlin Museum. It belongs to the XXIId Dynasty and so is the oldest known Egyptian document of its kind. It indicates that loans were made at the rate of 100 per cent. (Sitzb. Ber. Akad. 1921, pp. 298-304.) A Roman Governor at Thebes.-J. BAILLET discusses certain inscriptions in the royal tombs at Thebes which have been attributed to the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius. A more complete reading of the inscription con- taining the name Aurelius Antoninus proves that the person named visited the tomb with his wife Isadora, and hence was a hitherto unknown and relatively unimportant Aurelius Antoninus. The inscription attributed to Lucius Verus is really that of a Roman governor named Lucius Aurelius Catulinus, who further commemorated his travels in Egypt by inscribing incorrect Greek verses on the colossus of Memnon and in one of the tombs of Tell-el-Amarna. (C. R. Acad. Insc. 1921, pp. 58-64.) Hieroglyphic Signs for East and West.-G. MOLLER interprets two hiero- glyphic signs as meaning east and west. As the first seems to refer to the "cop- per mountain," i.e. the Sinaitic peninsula, and the second to the "feather- wearers" or Libyans, it appears that the use of these signs must have originated in Lower Egypt, in the same latitude with Sinai and Libya. (Sitzb. Ber. Akad. 1921, pp. 168-170.) A Certificate of Guardianship.-E. CUQ republishes and comments on a Latin diptych which was found at Cairo and given to the University of Oxford by Professor Sayce. (See The Bodleian Quarterly Record, 1919, pp. 259, 262.) The document certifies that the prefect of Egypt, Q. Aemilius Saturninus, has ap- pointed .M. Julius Alexander guardian to Maevia Dionysarion, who is a Roman citizen; it is dated September 23, 198 A.D. and signed by seven citizens. In certain matters a woman could act legally only through a guardian; and if none were designated by the will of her father or other male relative, she could petition for the appointment of a guardian. This diptych does not give the whole text of the decree granting a guardian to Maevia, but gives the certified information necessary for any person entering into any contract with the per- sons concerned. In the archives of the prefecture of Egypt was kept a brevia-</page><page sequence="5">BABYLONIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 197 rium containing summary records of official acts; and it was from this that such abridged certificates were copied. (C. R. Acad. Insc. 1920, pp. 40-56.) A Mediaeval Romance Traced to Egypt.-JEAN CAPART suggests that cer- tain features of the combat of Renart and Isengrin, in the mediaeval romance, may be traced to the Egyptian myth of the combat of Horus and Seth. (C. R. Acad. Insc. 1921, pp. 113-118.) The False Egyptian Sarcophagus at Tarragona.-PIERRE PARIS describes in detail the now fragmentary pseudo-Egyptian sarcophagus at Tarragona. There can be no doubt that it is neither Egyptian nor Iberian, but is a modern forgery, the rather interesting figured decoration of which is intended to picture the com- ing of Heracles and his followers to Spain. (R. Arch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 146-157; 6 figs.) A Bibliography of Papyri.-A fourth part of the 'Bulletin Papyrologique' published by SEYMOUR DE RICCI has appeared, comprising the second part of a description of papyrological material published 1904-1912. (R. Et. Gr. XXXIV, 1921, pp. 177-230.) The Centenary of Champollion.-The centenary of the discovery of the read- ing of Egyptian hieroglyphics is marked by a review of the life and work of Champollion. (The Times Literary Supplement, London, Feb. 22, 1922, pp. 65-66.) BABYLONIA, ASSYRIA AND PERSIA The Elephant in Ancient Asia.-C. W. BISHOP shows that the Asiatic elephant was common in Syria and Mesopotamia in the period of the XVIIIth Egyptian dynasty. Elephants and ivory are mentioned in the Babylonian and Assyrian records down to the time of Shalmaneser III. By the time of Alexander the elephant had disappeared from Western Asia and was not to be found short of India. In China the elephant was abundant in prehistoric times, but it had already disappeared by the time of the earliest contemporary historical records, about 1000 B.c. The memory of it still lingered in the traditions of the earliest dynasties that were preserved in the classical literature. The sign for "ele- phant" is one of the few primitive pictographs that lies at the basis of the Chinese system of writing, and this shows that the animal must have been familiar to the inventors of the earliest written characters. (J.A.O.S. XLI, 1921, pp. 290-306.) Babylonian Chronology.-A. T. CLAY gathers up all the material that has been discovered in the course of the last fifteen years that bears upon the old Babylonian dynasties, and gives a reconstructed list of the twenty-two dynas- ties before the first dynasty of Babylon with the names of the successive kings and the years of their reigns that are recorded on the tablets. If we leave out of account the first two dynasties, where the lengths of the reigns are fabulously large, and allow an average of only fifteen years for each of the kings of the succeeding dynasties, we obtain 4000 B.c. as a minimum date for the first dynasty of Ur. The thirty-four kings of the first two dynasties would carry us back several centuries earlier. These kings, even Etana, Lugal-Marda, Tam- muz, and Gilgamesh, were historical early monarchs. "It is not improbable that even the goddess Ishtar may prove to have been originally some notable human figure." Back of the recorded dynasties lies a prehistoric period of the development of civilization in Babylonia that carries us back as far as 6000 B.c. (J.A.O.S. XLI, 1921, pp. 241-263.)</page><page sequence="6">198 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 The Early Sumerian Religion.-J. P. PETERS maintains that the fundamental fact in the early Sumerian religion was the mystery of sex. Procreation was creation, and creation was conceived as procreation. The earliest liturgies are full of descriptions of sexual intercourse between gods and goddesses through which all things come into being, and vast numbers of phallic emblems have been discovered in all the mounds of Babylonia. The two most conspicuous features of nature in Babylonia were the annual inundations of the rivers on which the fertility of the land depended, and the raised mounds on which the villages and the mountain-house of the god stood. The former was personified as a fruitful mother, the latter as a male principle. On the proper union of these two as man and wife prosperity and security depended, and toward the consummation of this result the whole early Sumerian liturgy and ritual were directed. In essence these two divinities were the same in all places, but they assumed different names in different localities. Thus differentiated they came to be regarded as separate deities, and were adopted from one place to another, with a tendency to a specialization of functions, makingthem in the end separate gods. This was true especially of the male element of deity, which seemed, somehow, to lend itself more readily to polytheism than the female, which latter presented itself much more as a unity, merely called by different names. Thunder-storms, rain, and sickness were regarded as the work of evil spirits, and the great father and mother were invoked for protection against these. With the development of the city the king as the representative of the god came to be deified and partly identified with the male principle that controlled the in- undations and brought fertility out of them. Astral cults were not a part of the earliest Sumerian religion, but are to be regarded as new elements brought in by the Semitic invaders. (J.A.O.S. XLI, 1921, pp. 131-149.) This paper is discussed by G. A. BARTON. (Ibid. pp. 150-151.) The Farnbig Fire.-Among the sacred fires of Zoroastrian antiquity three stand out as specially ancient and sacred: the Farnbag fire, or "fire of the priests "; the Gishnasp fire, or "fire of the warriors"; and the Birz'in-Mitr6 fire, or "fire of the workers." The oldest and most famous of these is the Farnbag fire, and its original location is a matter of considerable archaeological and historical interest. A. V. W. JACKSON investigates the evidence, and comes to the conclusion that the traditions in regard to the Farnbag fire, or fire of Jamshid, so far as available, seem to agree as to the fact that it was established by Jamshid originally in Khvarazm (Khiva), but was removed from there later, in the time of Zoroaster, to another locality, probably Kariy~n in the Province of Firs. The whole of the old oriental testimony is to this effect and is borne out by the ruins of the fire-temple still existing at KEriyan and by modern accounts of the town and its legends. (J.A.O.S. XLI, 1921, pp. 81-106.) The Excavations of Victor Place.-MAURICE PILLET continues the publica- tion and elucidation of documents relating to the excavations carried on by Victor Place in Assyria. (R. Arch., fifth series, VI, 1917, pp. 171-196; 2 figs.) The documents here published relate to the various attempts made to recover the sculptures which were sunk in the Chatt-el-Arab in May, 1855. Further documents are published ibid. VII, 1918, pp. 113 ff. and VIII, 1918, pp. 181- 204. The documents contained in the last article comprise the inventories of</page><page sequence="7">SYRIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 199 the antiquities brought by Place to Europe and the budgets of his excavations and publications. A Sassanian Inscription.-J. DE MORGAN proposes a reading and interpreta- tion of a hitherto undeciphered sign which occurs on Sassanid coins, beginning with the time of Hormisdas IV. The epigraphic reading is ARMN; the word is kharman, which unites the ideas of wrath, force, power-perhaps best ren- dered "puissance." (C. R. Acad. Insc. 1920, pp. 231-240.) SYRIA AND PALESTINE Importance of Research in Syria.-J. A. MONTGOMERY calls attention to the importance of archaeological research in Syria, and to the opportunities for such study which are opened by the establishment of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusualem. (Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institu- tion, 1919, pp. 433-441; 3 pls.) The Earliest Canaanite Inscriptions.-CH. BRUSTON discusses the early Canaanite inscriptions from the region of Sinai. He gives their meaning and offers new readings. The name of the goddess Hathor is, he asserts, Semitic, signifying "abundance." These are the earliest alphabetic inscriptions known, dating some 500 years before the rise of the Phoenicians. The dialect is that of the inhabitants of Goshen (i.e. Hebrews) before the time of Moses. It is from this primitive alphabet, transmitted through Arameans or Syrians and the Greek colonies of Asia Minor, rather than from the Phoenician alphabet, that the Greek alphabet is derived. The order of the letters in the alphabet was probably arranged so that their names, as pronounced, made a sentence. (R. Arch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 49-80; two pages of alphabets and fac- similes.) The Meaning of the Word Ariel.-The word ariel occurs a number of times in the Old Testament and in the Mesha Inscription. It seems to have four distinct meanings, hero, image, altar, and a synonym for Jerusalem. S. FEIGIN seeks to correlate these by the assumption that the word is derived from Aralu, the Babylonian name for Hades. Ariel then means the dead, an image of the dead, an altar for the cult of the dead, and the necropolis of ancient Jerusalem in which the tombs of the kings were located. This interpretation is supported by Isa. xxix, 2, where Ariel is used as a synonym for Hades. (J. Bibl. Lit. XXXIX, 1920, pp. 131-137.) The Babylonian Temple-Tower and the Altar of Burnt-Offering.-W. F. ALBRIGHT holds that Ariel as a name of Jerusalem is identical with Babylonian Aralu, the mountain of god, the abode of the dead. The Temple resembled a Babylonian temple-tower of three stages, and the altar of burnt-offering was a miniature temple-tower of three stages. (J. Bibl. Lit. XXXIX, 1920, pp. 137-142.) The Solid Ephod of the Ancient Hebrews.-K. BUDDE examines afresh the evidence in regard to the ephod mentioned in the Books of Judges and Samuel, which was made of metal, set up, carried by the priests, and used as a medium for obtaining oracles. He rejects the view of W. R. Arnold in his recent work Ephod and Ark that the solid ephod is everywhere a Jewish scribal sub- stitute for .' ark," and maintains instead that ephod is a correction of abbir, "bullock," a designation of the golden bull-images of Yahweh that were used by ancient Israel. (Z. Alttest. Wiss. XXXIX, 1921, pp. 1-42.)</page><page sequence="8">200 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXVI, 1922 Alleged Palestinian Pyxes.-S. RONZEVALLE shows that the little pottery objects with bits of glass in the centre, which are often found in the tombs of Palestine, are not pyxes for depositing the Eucharist with the dead, but are simple mirrors. Some of these disk-shaped objects are held by female figures of the Astarte type, which precludes the possibility of any Eucharistic connec- tion; and traces of the lead with which these mirrors were backed have also been discovered. (Pal. Ex. Fund, LIII, 1921, pp. 172-174; 2 pls.) The Inscription of Theodotus.-L. H. VINCENT gives an elaborate account of the "Synagogue of the Freedmen" and the inscription of Theodotus dis- covered by R. Weill in the excavations at Mount Zion during the winter of 1913-14. (R. Bibl. XXX, 1921, pp. 247-277; see A.J.A. XXV, 1921, p. 168.) The Princeton Expedition to Syria.-With the issue of the seventh part of the section devoted to Southern Syria (Division II, Section A, Part 7, pp. 403-473; pl. 29; figs. 352-388) Professor HowARD CROSBY BUTLER completes the publica- tion of the results attained in the field of ancient architecture by the Princeton expeditions of 1904-1905 and 1909. The sites described, all of which are in the Ledja, are the following: Br~keh, Djdlyeh, Rtmet il-Luhf, Tell id-Dibbeh, NedjrAn, D1r il-Asmar, Umm il-'Alak, Beshm, il-'Ahreh, Sm~d, Mdjddil, Wakm, KhurabAt, Kharsah, LubbLn, Djr~n, Harrdn, Msbkeh, il-Ublr, Sir, il-'Asim, Djedil, Dmit il-'AlyB, DIr idj-DjiwAni, Djisreh, Zubaiyir, Zebtr, Sha'arah, Mismiyeh, Taff, Sahr, Hammn and Tubbeh. The inscriptions found on the same sites are published by ENNO LITTMANN and DAVID MAGEE, JR., in Division III, Section A, Part 7 (pp. 373-488). There are 130 in all. The Hittite Language.-M. BLOOMFIELD (J.A.O.S. XLI, 1921, pp. 195- 209) discusses the Hittite documents from Boghazkeui and the treatise on the Hittite language recently published by F. Hrozny with a view to the alleged Indo-European character of the Hittite language. The Indo-European aspects of "Hittite" have no basis in any known historic colonizations by Indo-Eu- ropeans of parts of Asia Minor. We should have to assume an Indo-European settlement many centuries prior to the Aryan, Celtic, Italic, and Hellenic mi- grations. "Hittite" seems to contain an injection of Indo-European material in a composite pidgin-Kanesian, but even this is not quite certain. "Hittite" has scarcely a noun of indisputable Indo-European etymology, except wadar, said to mean "water." The verbal inflections are at points bewitchingly Indo-European, at other points they are no less bewitchingly mystifying. Not a dozen verbs are securely of Indo-European etymology. The pronouns look Indo-European, but only the indefinite-interrogative is certain. The heaping of conglutinative particles combined with the conglutinative use of personal pronouns at the end of nouns is non-Indo-European.. Ibid. pp. 210-224, J. D. PRINCE comes to the conclusion that "Hittite" displays a mixed and, at the present moment, in many instances untraceable morphology. It is highly probable that this idiom may have to be classified eventually in a group by itself, perhaps standing half way between Indo-European and non-Aryan languages such as Finno-Ugric and Turkic. A Series of Seleucid Tetradrachms from Tyre.-E. T. NEWELL attributes to the mint of Tyre a series of Seleucid tetradrachms and drachms of the period 200-150 B.c. Hitherto only bronze coins of this date have been definitely assigned to Tyre. The silver series is homogeneous, and similar in style to the</page><page sequence="9">ASIA MINOR] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 201 later Phoenician tetradrachms of Alexander Bala, known to have been struck at Tyre. The constant use of the club as a symbol confirms the attribution. [The First Seleucid Coinage of Tyre, Num. Notes, No. 10; New York, 1921, American Numismatic Society; 40 pp., 8 pls.; 16 mo.; $1.] New Seleucid Copper Types.-EDGAR ROGERS describes new types on the copper coinage of the Seleucid monarchs, which will help to fill in "the sketchy classifications of past days." Prominent in his list are a Demetrius I with a full-face head of Pallas, and a new coin of Alexander Zebina with an elephant's head, recalling earlier Syrian issues. (Num. Chron. 1921, pp. 26-36; pl.) ASIA MINOR The Aramaeo-Lydian Inscription of Sardis.-A. E. COWLEY publishes a new interpretation of the bilingual inscription from Sardis, differing in many par- ticulars from Littmann's reading. The Aramaic of the inscription is provincial and somewhat incorrect; the Lydian writer uses Aramaic "as our diplomats speak French." (C. R. Acad. Insc. 1921, pp. 7-14.) The Sun-dials of Pergamon.-That the twin sun-dials of Pergamon had gnomons of equal length (cf. Ath. Mitt. XXXVI, 1911, 251 ff.) is proved by the independent and purely mathematical studies of J. Drecker. (A. REHM, Ath. Mitt. XL, 1915, p. 111.) The Temple of Athena at Priene.-A. voN GERKAU argues (against Wilberg, Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 72 ff.) that the fiieze was lacking in the Athena temple at Priene. The Ionic frieze, he thinks, arose in the west under the in- fluence of the Doric order. (Ath. Mitt. XLIII, 1918, pp. 165-176; 3 figs.) A Guide to Ephesus.-In 1915 the Austrian Archaeological Institute pub- lished in the small compass of ninety pages a guide to the ruins of Ephesus written by Dr. J. KEIL. After a description of the site the author sketches the history of the town from its foundation down to its destruction at the beginning of the fifteenth century A.D. He then describes the various buildings of which remains exist, gives illustrations of many of them, and sometimes plans and reconstructions. He also includes important Turkish remains. There is an introduction by E. Reisch. [Fiihrer durch Ephesos. Von JOSEPH KEIL. Vienna, 1915, Hblder. 90 pp.; 46 figs.; 2 maps.] An Ephesian Decree.-E. WEISs discusses the inscription from Ephesus pub- lished by R. HEBERDEY, Jh. Oest. Arch. I. 1904, cols. 4 ff. (Ibid. XVIII, 1915, Beiblatt, cols. 285-306.) Monuments of the Mother Goddess.-J. KEIL publishes a relief found at Ephesus in 1912 representing a seated woman holding a patera in her right hand and a large drum in her left. In front of her are two seated lions, and on either side a standing male figure, one youthful and the other of middle age. The relief came from the sanctuary of the Mother Goddess identified by inscriptions. Thirteen other monuments of the same character are described. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I.

MILNE to his classifica- tion of Smyrnaean silver coins in Num. Chron. for 1914. It is judged by him to be earlier as well as artistically finer than the usual Homereia of Smyrna. He would class it with the first issues of coins of that type, and assign as an approximate date 180 B.c. (Num. Chron. 1921, pp. 143-144; pl.)</page><page sequence="10">202 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 GREECE ARCHITECTURE The Doric Temple.-The origin of the Doric temple is discussed by G. RODENWALDT. As being merely the home of the cult statue the Greek temple could not have arisen in the Geometric period, when no large statues were made, nor was it a development of the Mycenaean megaron. It came rather from the continental country house of the seventh century and earlier, was developed under Egyptian influence, and was originally of stone. The use of wooden columns in the Heraeum at Olympia was a provincialism. (Ath. Mitt. XLIV, 1919, pp. 175-184.) The Development of the Doric Capital.-W. WILBERG discusses the develop- ment of the Doric capital. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, pp. 167-181; 4 figs.) The Columns of the Olympieum.-In a study entitled 'The Age of the Extant Columns of the Olympieum at Athens,' A. D. FRASER comes to the conclusion that these columns, which have been attributed by Penrose and others to the period of Antiochus Epiphanes, are actually of the time of Hadrian. (1) The workmanship of the columns is not too fine for the Greek style of Hadrian's period, which was marked by a revival of Hellenism. (2) The lack of exag- gerated entasis is not alien to the best art of this period. (3) The lines of the abacus, which Penrose thought characteristically Hellenistic, are almost iden- tical with those of the Corinthian capital of the Arch of Hadrian at Athens. (4) The type of the acanthus leaf, which Penrose compared to that of the tholos at Epidaurus, is no more imitative of that model than are other Hadrianic capitals. On these four counts, the columns could as well be Hadrianic as Hellenistic. The question is settled by a detail in the design of the capitals: (5) The acanthus bloom represented in the centre of each side of the abacus is supported by a slender stalk rising between the inner volutes. This support- ing stem is not found on capitals of earlier than Roman date, but is charac- teristic of Imperial architecture. It is found on the capital of the Ara Pacis, and on the Arch of Hadrian at Athens. (Art Bulletin, IV, 1921; pp. 5-18, 2 pls.) SCULPTURE A Minoan Bronze Statuette in the British Museum.-A small and somewhat roughly cast statuette of almost pure copper, of unknown origin, which has been in the British Museum for many years, is now seen, from its likeness to the praying figure from Tylissus in Crete, published in 1912, to be Minoan, and presumably of the M. M. III period. It represents a male.votary standing in the attitude of prayer, with the right hand raised to the forehead, palm up, and the left arm dropped at the side. The exaggerated hollow of the back and the costume of boots, kilt and belt are characteristically Minoan, and a snake in the hair connects the object with the worship of the Cretan snake goddess. (F. N. PRYCE, J.H.S. XLI, 1921, pp. 86-90; pl.; 3 figs.) The Gigantomachy in the Pediment of the Old Athena Temple.-R. HEBER- DEY discusses the composition of the gigantomachy in the pediment of the old temple of Athena on the Acropolis (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 40-56; 7 figs.). H. SCHRADER dissents from some of Heberdey's conclusions (Ibid.</page><page sequence="11">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 203 XIX-XX, 1919, pl. 154-161; 10 figs.). HEBERDEY defends his position (Ibid. Beiblatt, cols. 329-340), which is further criticised by SCHRADER (Ibid. cols. 341-346). BERLIN.-An Early Bronze Mirror Handle.-C. PRASCHNIKER publishes an archaic bronze statuette which once formed the support for a mirror. It repre- sents a nude female figure in high head-dress holding castanets in her extended right hand. The left hand and feet are missing. Above the right shoulder is a small winged figure. An amulet is attached to a cord running over the right shoulder and under the left arm. The hair hangs down the back. The figure was found at Vonitza on the Gulf of Ambracia, and is now in the Berlin mu- seum. It dates from the second half of the sixth century B.c. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 57-60; 3 figs.) An Apollo Head in Vienna.--There is in the possession of the University of Vienna a head of Apollo, best known in another replica in Kassel. A. SCHOBER compares all the copies and discusses their relative nearness to the original. The earliest copy appears to be an unpublished head in Athens. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 79-93; pl.; 14 figs.) The Athena Parthenos and the Olympian Zeus of Phidias.-F. WINTER argues from a study of the bases of the two statues in their relation to the temples in which they stood that the Athena Parthenos of Phidias is earlier than his Zeus at Olympia. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 1-16; 4 figs.) Two Masterpieces of the Youthful Phidias.-W. KLEIN argues that the Lem- nian Athena, correctly recognized by Furtwingler in the Dresden Athena, did not stand alone but had a companion figure which represented Hephaestus. A head in the Museo Barracco, of which a copy is in Petrograd, was con- nected by Furtwangler with the Lemnia. It is in reality a copy of the head of the Amazon of Phidias, which is to be reconstructed with the right hand grasp- ing the spear above, while the left rests lightly on the shaft. The point is turned upward. The Lemnia, like the Amazon, was an early work of Phidias, perhaps a memorial of the Persian Wars, and not dedicated by Athenian clerouchs setting out for Lemnos. The Madrid statuette of Athena may be a copy of the Promachos. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 17-39; 16 figs.) The Parthenon Frieze.-G. FOUGRES renews the discussion of the motive of the Parthenon frieze.. The subject of the archaic "Erechtheum" pediment in the Acropolis Museum cannot have been a prototype of that of the Parthenon frieze, because it has not been demonstrated that this pediment showed any processional figures. Nor has it been proved that the archaic relief of a figure mounting a chariot belongs to a frieze from the pronaos of the Pisistratean hecatompedon. More probably it and the other reliefs which seem to have been associated with it are from the pedestal of an ex-voto. In motive the Parthenon frieze finds its only true analogy in votive reliefs. As these express in a graphic and popular style the devotion of an individual or a family to a divinity, so the Parthenon frieze commemorates the devotion of the city of Athens to its protecting goddess. The idea of this sublimation of a motive of popular art to a monumental purpose was original with Phidias. He placed his great votive relief in the only position suitable to its function. The pedi- ments and metopes were traditionally reserved for the representation of myths. (R. ft. Gr. XXXII, 1919, pp. 208-226.) Lycius.-Lycius, son of Myron, is the subject of a detailed investigation by</page><page sequence="12">204 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 Carlo Anti (B. Com. Romr. XLVII, 1919, pp. 55-138; 2 pls.) The Demeter of Cherchel, a herm in the Barracco Museum, the figure of a boy in the Antiqua- rium on the Caelian, and a boy in basalt in the Palatine Museum are ascribed to this artist. The stylistic similarity of these works to the great Eleusis relief is pointed out. The best part of the east front of the Parthenon frieze (Iris, Hera, Zeus, Athena, Hephaestus and the presentation of the peplos) is also claimed for Lycius. Lycius shows the influence of Myron only in technical matters, otherwise he is influenced more by the pre-Polyclitan Peloponnesian school and by Phidias. His chief characteristic is "illustrationism." He was active before 450 and after 420 B.C. Two Greek Heads in the Fogg Museum.-A new publication of the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University is inaugurated with a brief discussion of " :':- i;: :: :.:::::--_i_:i~: - - : :i:-: ':;:- i :: - .-. 2?'~ 1. ,8" ._-i F c i: :: FIGURE 1.--HEAD OF WVARRIOR: FIFTH CENTURY: CAMBRIDGE. two marble heads recently acquired by the Museum. (1) The first, which is fragmentary, is part of a statue of a warrior, wearing a close-fitting Attic helmet of simple form (Fig. 1). The material is Pentelic marble, and the subject suggests a comparison with the Borghese Ares in the Louvre. That, however, is a copy of a more subtly modelled and sophisticated work. The head at Cambridge may be assigned to an Athenian sculptor of about the date of the Parthenon pediments. (2) The second head (Fig. 2), which shows much more variety and richness of modelling, belongs to the early years of the fourth century B.C. The shape of the skull and face suggests that it is a work of the Attic school. The somewhat swollen ears indicate that the subject is an athlete. The material is Parian marble.

One of the Niobids was used as a model, probably to repre- sent some other subject, by a "baroque" artist in early Hellenistic times. The Chiaromonti Niobid is this Hellenistic original. The Head of a Youth.-A. SCHOBER publishes the head of a youth in Vienna purchased from a dealer in Rome. It is a good copy of an original, perhaps an ideal portrait, of the fourth century B.c. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, pp. 182-189; pl.; 3 figs.) Two Groups of Sculpture.-W. KLEIN attempts to recover among existing marbles parts of the group of four satyrs mentioned by Pliny, N. H.

Another group, the. symplegma of Heliodorus, is to be found in the Pan and Daphnis in the museum at Naples. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, pp. 253-267; 6 figs.)

HEKLER publishes the portrait head of an aged man in the National Museum at Athens. He compares it with the portrait of the aged Homer and suggests that it represents Hipponax. It dates from the first century B.C. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 61-65; 4 figs.) Studies of Two Reliefs.-J. SIEVEKING presents new interpretations of two reliefs. (1) The relief from the Athenian olive wood, now in Berlin (Conze, Att. Grabr. IV, p. 8, No. 1743) is an ex-voto of the early Imperial period, dedicated by a Roman family in honor of the teacher from whom they learned Greek. The curious representation in the upper part of the relief is the letter 'I, and is a reminder of the introduction of this letter in the Ionic alphabet at Athens. The dignified seated figure at the left in the relief is a statue of Archinus, who made this reform. The Roman family is shown at the right, their teacher at the left of this figure. The great area of free space in this relief leads the author to dis- cuss the function of accessories in Hellenistic relief. Their use is not due to the idyllic spirit or to a desire for depth or picturesque effect, but rather to the Hellenistic tendency to individualize each person and act. (2) A pair of Bac- chic reliefs in Rome (Matz-Duhn, Ant. Bildwerke in Rom. I, No. 2311) has been regarded by Robert as a pastiche. It is is more probably a unitary work, rep- resenting the planting and the fruitage of the vine in Icaria, in the presence of Dionysus, Icarius, and other figures of the legend. If Robert's objection that in the fourth century A.D., to which the relief has been held to belong, this myth would not have been known, is valid, the relief may be a creation of the Renaissance. (Hermeneutische Reliefstudien, Sitzb. Mtiin. Akad. 1920; 31 pp.; 3 figs.; 8vo.) The Temple Servant of Nicomachus.-J. BANKO (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX- XX, 1919, pp. 296-298; pl.; fig.) publishes a bronze statuette of an old woman, apparently a priestess or servant, in Vienna. It was found at the ancient Noviodunum in 1893 and is .148 m. high. The hands and feet are missing. It was, perhaps, part of a group. Ibid. pp. 299-316 (4 figs.) E. REISCH argues that this is a copy of the statuette of the temple attendant, Lysimache, men- tioned by Pausanias, I, 27, 4 (reading AvU7L0LX). The inscribed base of the original statuette still exists and shows that the old woman's name was Syeris (cf. the corrupt reading ebipLs in Pausanias), and that Nicomachus, a sculptor of the fourth century B.c., was the artist. The portrait of Lysimache herself was by Demetrius of Colophon and is, perhaps, reproduced in the portrait head of an old woman in London. A Head of Zeus from Aegira.-O. WALTER publishes the colossal marble head of Zeus found at Aegira in 1915 and now in Athens. The head is 0.87 m. high and was cut away behind, evidently for the purpose of being backed with stone or some other material. The head is identified with the head of the cult statue of Zeus by the Athenian sculptor Euclides mentioned by Pausanias (VII, 26, 4). The statue is reproduced on coins of Aegira of the time of Septimrnius Severus. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I.

SCHWEITZER continues his studies in the chronology and history of Greek geometric vases, the first part of which appeared as a dis- sertation in 1918. He attempts to establish the dates of the founding of the Greek colonies in the west; examines the relation of the various types of graves on geometric sites, and then traces the development of the style with reference to the adjustment of decoration to the field. He concludes that the essential principle of geometric as a new variety, lies in its tendency to "plastic," rather than "picturesque," representation. As an appendix he publishes the twenty- one late Attic Dipylon vases of the Lambros collection. (Ath. Mitt. XLIII, 1918, pp. 1-152; 6 pls.; 32 figs.) Red-Figured Vases in the British Museum.-A list of the Attic red-figured vases acquired by the British Museum since 1895 and not included in the Catalogue issued in 1896, is given by H. B. WALTERS (J.H.S. XLI, 1921, pp. 117-159; 7 pls.; 14 figs.). Forty-seven vases are described and many of them illustrated, and a list of seventeen others which have been published elsewhere is appended. They date from the earliest transitional period to the middle of the fourth century and are divided into five classes established by J. B. Beasley in his Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums, the last class of "ripe free" or "late fine" style, being the most numerous. One of the cylices of the early archaic period is the best of the known examples of the work of the potter Euergides. Chachrylion's signature also occurs. Among the unusual or in- teresting subjects are Theseus and the dead Minotaur, and gryphons guarding a heap of gold, after Herodotus's story of the Arimaspians' country in western Siberia (IV, 13; II1, 116). Many of the latest vases, some of which are of South Italian manufacture, depict marriage scenes and the home life of women, a wedding procession on a very fine pyxis being especially detailed. Dynamic Symmetry: A Criticism.-E. M. BLAKE shows that from a mathe- matical standpoint the formulae evolved by Hambidge as normative for Greek pottery can be applied, within the limits of error in measurement, to any proportions whatsoever. The possibilities of each of the so-called root systems, either those used by Hambidge, or infinite others, are boundless, so that there is no telling by measuring an object from which root system, if any, it may have been evolved.

HOLLEAUX publishes with detailed com- mentary a Chaeronean decree discovered at Delphi, relating to the first war of Mithradates. The inscription proves that at the outbreak of the war the Odrysi were governed by Sadalas; that this Sadalas was an ally of the Romans and furnished them with troops which served under Sulla at Chaeronea and Or- chomenos in 86 B.c.; and that during his siege of Athens, Sulla took care to have Boeotia occupied by his own or auxiliary troops.

STAIS restores the famous silver vase from Mycenae as a rhyton of the familiar Cretan shape (Fig. 3). The scene is interpreted as an attack upon a walled city by the crew of a pirate ship. At the bottom is a net or scale pattern. The work is assigned to a local artist and is dated soon after M. M. III. On p. 112 Stais calls attention to a new drawing of the vase by E. Gillieron, Jr., in which the improbable irregularity of outline is cor- rected by lengthening the rhyton and straightening the line of the sides. (Ath. Mitt. XL, 1915, pp. 45-52, 112; 2 pls.) A Hittite Motive in Mycenaean Art.- V. IK. 1ULLER compares the ornamental device on the head of the "stickpin" from Mycenae (cf. Jb. Arch. I. XXX, 1915, pp. 289 ff.) with Hittite cylinder's representing the Magna Mater. The Mycenaean artist used the Hittite features of extended arms, horizontal lines at the hips and half-circle over the head, but translated the semi-circle into a vegetable motive. (Ath. Mitt.

The disk would not have been preserved in Crete unless it had some importance. This suggests that it was a treaty or diplomatic communication, and the use of stamps in producing it also suggests an office in which such stamps were kept. This seems to preclude the idea that it was a religious, literary, or musical com- position. Can it have been an official communication from some African king- dom with which the Cretan traders had commercial relations? (Pal. Ex. Fund, LIII, 1921, pp. 141-145.) The Whorl from Hagios O,nuphrios.-CHAMPLIN BURRAGE begins a series of studies of Minoan inscriptions with a discussion of the whorl found at Hagios Onuphrios near Phaestus (Scripta Minoa, I, p. 118, figs. 52a and b). The characters on both sides which Sir Arthur Evans has taken as ideographs are to be read as phonetic letters. The shorter inscription is K(a)1= KA1Xws (TXws); the longer is K(a)l'kin(i)(a)= Ka~xuia (TEXXlvla). Three different legendary figures called Talos are associated with Crete; and the Telchinians of Rhodes are said to have migrated from Crete. (Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, XXXII, 1921, pp. 177-183; 2 figs.) The Human Figure in Archaic Art.-G. voN L{CKEN reviews the develop- ment in the representation of the human form by Greek vase painters and sculptors to the end of the archaic period. The former focused his attention chiefly on the human figure in motion; the latter endeavored to express the "corporality" of his subjects. At the end of the period the two aims coalesce, and from now on each branch of art could have greater influence on the other. (Ath. Mitt. XLIV, 1919, pp. 47-174; 6 pls.; 17 figs.) Ancient Greek Weaving.-J. Six points out that women are depicted on Greek vases weaving upon a small upright frame held in the lap. There were upper and under threads and the pattern was produced by carrying the threads over and under according to a definite plan. The process is known in Germany as "durchbrochene Arbeit." (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, pp. 162-166; 5 figs.) The Delphic Omphalos and Egyptian Religion.-T. HOMOLLE compares the Delphic omphalos with an object frequently represented in Egyptian paintings and described as a "vaulted chamber" typifying the funerary region in which Osiris is buried and restored to life. It is flanked by two birds recalling the two eagles of Delphi. According to one tradition the Delphic ornphalos was the tomb of Dionysus; another made it the grave of the serpent Pytho. The cult of Dionysus was associated with serpents; and the serpent at Delphi may have originally been a symbol of the god. The identification of Dionysus with Osiris is even earlier than Herodotus; and the omphalos at Delphi may be a cult symbol originally transmitted from Egypt, perhaps through Crete. (R. Et. Gr. XXXII, 1919, pp. 338-358; 12 figs.) The Name of the Ionians.-A. CUNY, in a study of the history of the name "Ionian" concludes that the ancient name * Yaw had lost its final w before the Greek occupation of the region later called Ionia. At this time * Yawan or * Ya was indiscriminately used as the name of the eponymous ancestor of the race. (R. Et. Gr. XXXIV, 1921, pp. 155-162.) The Dorian Invasion.-STANLEY CASSON has published a new examination of the literary and archaeological evidence on the Dorian Invasion. The liter- ary tradition points to two main streams of invasion: (1) an eastern, entering</page><page sequence="18">210 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXVI, 1922 the Peloponnesus by the Isthmus; (2) a western, crossing the narrow mouth of the Corinthian Gulf to Rhion in Achaea. A study of the archaeological data may be based on the certain premise that the small objects found in the British excavations at Sparta and dated in the tenth and ninth centuries B.c. are Dorian. The discovery of similar objects-geometric horses and birds, "spec- tacle" spirals, etc.-at Dodona, Thermon, Olympia, and Leucas confirms the tradition of the western invasion. Similar finds in Thessaly, at Elatea, at Mount Ptous, at Athens, at Mycenae, and at Argos, indicate the route of the eastern invaders. Recent discoveries at Lake Ostrovo near Monastir, and at Kalindoia (modern Chauchitza) include objects of the same style. A sword of "antenna" type found at Kalindoia suggests that the Dorian culture is a branch of one which had a wide extent in Central and Southern Europe; and similar in- ferences may be drawn from discoveries made by Professor Ernest Gardner at Aivasil on Lake Langaza, south of Lake Doiran. "The origin of Dorian cul- ture must be sought farther north than Epirus or Thessaly, or even farther north than Macedonia." It reached Macedonia through the Vardar valley. Hallstatt belongs to the same cultural group as the Dorians. The eastern stream of invasion passed through Athens, and in spite of Athenian tradition, there was probably a Dorian settlement in the Ceramicus, responsible for the special development of the geometric style which is seen in the Dipylon vases. Eastern and western invasions converged upon Sparta. The lack of artistic skill in the Dorians is due to their nomadic condition. After they were estab- lished at Sparta they developed a considerable art. A fine example of pure Dorian art is the frieze of the sixth century temple at Prinias in Crete. The recent excavations at Mycenae have proved that it was the Dorians who over- threw the Mycenaean civilization. The great walls of Mycenae were built 1400-1200 B.C. under the threat of a northern attack which ultimately proved successful. (Ant. J. I, 1921, pp. 199-218; 3 figs.) Arrow-heads from Marathon.-E. J. FORSDYKE discusses arrow-heads from the battle-field of Marathon (Proc. Soc. Ant. XXXII, 1919-1920, pp. 146-157; 9 figs.). Many of the small bronze arrow-heads said to have been found on this site-are of common Greek types. Of more special interest are two classes of alien origin. (1) The first comprises a series of iron arrow-heads with tangs. Sections through these heads vary from a quadrangular to a flat form, and the transition between the two is seen in points of which two opposite angles have been bevelled off. The square bolt is found in Cyprus, the flat in various Asiatic sites, and it is evident that these forms are not Greek. The in- termediate forms find their nearest analogies in arrow-heads of modern date from the Far East. Hence it is clear that the iron arrow-heads from Marathon are oriental. (2) In a collection at Karlsruhe, said on uncertain authority to be from Marathon, is a large bronze arrow-head with tang and barbs. Similar heads are found in the British Museum. The evidence of Cretan coins shows that this was the form of arrow-head used by the famous Cretan bowmen. Rhodian Demes.-F.

WOLTERS OfferS new identifications of cities in Messenia visited by Cyriacus in 1447-48; changes the assignment of several inscriptions in the Corpus, and proves that what Cyriacus believed to be My- cenae was really Katsingri, 6 km. northeast of Nauplia. On pp. 106-110, G. KARO describes this citadel and gives a plan and a photograph of its probably fourth-century wall. (Ath. Mitt. XL, 1915, pp. 91-105; 2 figs.) ITALY ARCHITECTURE The Villa of Horace at Tivoli.-The evidence of Horace on the situation of his villa at Tivoli is discussed by G. H. HALLAM, who concludes that the tradi- tional site at the Monastery of S. Antonio is probably the true one. (Atti e Memorie della Societ4 Tiburtina di Storia e d'Arte, I, 1921, pp. 3-20; fig.) T. ASHBY describes the actual remains of the Augustan villa incorporated in the structure of the monastery. (Ibid. pp. 21-29; 2 figs.) The Villa of Domitian.-G. LUGLI gives the third installment of his discus- sion of the Villa of Domitian in the Alban Hills. He takes up a number of scattered structures, usually pre- or post-Flavian, such as roads, a crypto- porticus, cisterns, nymphaea, wharves, a lighthouse, etc. (B. Com. Rom. XLVII, 1919, p. 153-205, 3 pls.) The Underground Basilica.-F. CUMONT upholds his hypothesis in regard to the original purpose of the subterranean basilica near the Porta Maggiore, Rome. That the place served as a meeting place for a sect of neo-Pythagoreans is indicated not only by its general form and arrangement, but especially by the most plausible interpretation of the subjects of the stucco decorations, which contain so many references to after-life, important in Pythagorean doctrines. (Rass. d'Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 37-44; 11 figs.) Jewish Catacombs in Rome.-FRANZ CUMONT, reviewing the substance of a number of recent publications on Jewish cemeteries in Rome, expresses regret that many of these monuments have been destroyed, and points out the need of a collection of Jewish inscriptions. (Syria, II, 1921, p. 145-148.) The Aesthetics of the Ancient City.-G. CALZA shows that for obtaining an understanding of the Roman attitude toward city planning Ostia offers better material than either Pompeii or Rome. For at Ostia we have all the features of an ancient city, animated by the same life as that of Rome in its period of great building renaissance. At Ostia we see how the Roman laid out his city in a clear, but not too symmetrical plan, how he had an unconscious feeling for a relationship between buildings adapted to various purposes. (Rass. d'Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 261-264; 3 figs.) SCULPTURE Archaic Bronzes from Brolio.-L. PERNIER describes a series of bronzes which were found at Brolio, between Arezzo and Cortona, on the site of an ancient lake, and which have passed into the Museo Topografico dell'Etruria and the collection of Signora Enrichetta of Ancona. The most important are four archaic statuettes, one of which represents a goddess holding two spears, 7</page><page sequence="20">212 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 while the other three are helmeted warriors brandishing spears. The first figure, whose rigid frontality is like that of the Artemis dedicated by Nicandra at Delos, shows some decorative details imitative of Cretan ornament. The three warriors are of Cretan type, recalling those who appear on the conical steatite vase from Hagia Triada. The goddess is Dictinna; the warriors are her brothers the Curetes; and the four figures probably served as supports of a throne of Rhea. This series of bronzes, then, belongs to a deposit of objects sacred to the Great Mother, and has analogies in finds of ex-votos made at Prinia, at Phaestus, and at the sanctuary of Dictaean Zeus at Palaikastro in Crete. Among the votive objects of the Brolio find are a horse, three stags, two hares, the figure of a warrior in full armor, in the attitude of a promachos, and two female figures which are crude in workmanship, but are curiously orna- mented with incised patterns on the dress, suggesting the scale pattern which occurs often in Egyptian, Cretan, and oriental art. (Dedalo, II, 1922, pp. 485- 498; 15 figs.) Recent Restorations.--LucIo MARIANI describes three recently restored statues in the Antiquarium (B. Com. Rom. XLVII, 1919, p. 139-152; 2 pls.). One, an athlete with an oil flask (Roman, going back to a fifth-century type), had been erroneously restored as a gladiator in the seventeenth century. Another is a youthful Athena of the type that has been ascribed to Timotheus. The third is the torso of a mature woman with very rich draperies, the frag- ments of which were found in the Cimitero Ostiense near S. Paolo. It is, perhaps, to be dated in imperial times. Numa in the House of the Vestals.-The male statue found by Lanciani in 1883 among the statues of the Vestal Virgins and by him identified as a portrait of Vettius Agorius Praetextatus is claimed for Numa by Carlo Anti (B. Com. Rom. XLVII, 1919, pp. 211-224.). It is of the middle of the second century A.D., the work of a second rate sculptor who used an ideal Greek archaic head as model. A Roman Portrait Head in Budapest.-A. HEKLER publishes the portrait head of a woman in the museum at Budapest. It is Roman, and came from the Palazzo Brancacci. It is larger than life size and, perhaps, represents some member of the Claudian house. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, pp. 242- 246; 2 pls.; 2 figs.) A Relief from Lecce.-A. HEKLER publishes part of a relief from Lecce, 0.47 m. high and 0.67 m. long, now in the museum at Budapest. There are four figures, two mounted and two afoot, engaged in combat. One pair are clearly Gauls, the others men of Southern Italy. The relief dates from the end of the third century B.c. and was part of the frieze of a large tomb. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 94-97; pl.; fig.) Scene from the Lusus Iuvenalis.-R. EGGER calls attention to a relief from Virunum in the museum at Klagenfurt and shows that it represents a scene from the lusus iuvenalis. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 115-129.) The Cult of the Lares.--V. SKRABAR discusses various reliefs found at Poe- tovio (Pettau) which have to do with the cult of the Lares. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I.

They date from the second and third centuries A.D. The reliefs fall into two</page><page sequence="21">ITAL. PAINTING] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 213 groups: 1, in which the Nutrix is nursing a child while another woman holds out a child to her; and 2, a cult scene in which offerings are brought to the Nutrix. The worship of the Nutrices was a local cult. They had a temple at Pettau. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, Beiblatt, cols. 189-218; 22 figs.) The "Bed of Polyclitus."-C. HUELSEN shows that there is in the Palazzo Mattei a modern copy in marble of the relief known as the "Bed of Polyclitus." It represents a male figure in bed, a nude female figure sitting on the bed, and a small female figure crouching on the floor. The original was once in the posses- sion of Ghiberti, but has been lost since about 1630. Another modern copy in marble was formerly in the Palazzo Corsetti. Two bronze copies, both lost, are also known. The relief had considerable fame in Renaissance times. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 130-137; fig.) A Pseudo-Egyptian Relief.-JEAN COLIN publishes a relief in Florence rep- resenting a procession in honor of Isis ('une procession isiaque'). The relief is carved on a block of hard granite, which once formed the base of a column. The Roman sculptor evidently tried to imitate the Egyptian style. The relief, which was already in Florence before 1825, evidently came from the temple of Isis and Serapis in the Campus Martius at Rome. Two similar vases are in the courtyard of the Museo Capitolino. Part of the base in Florence has been cut away, so that it is no longer round. The six persons represented are all priests or worshippers of Isis, as were, no doubt, the two represented on the missing part of the base. (Mdl. Arch. Hist. XXXVIII, 1920, pp. 279-283; 3 pls.) PAINTING Pompeian Wall Paintings of the Third Style.-W. KLEIN continues his study of Pompdian wall paintings with a discussion of the characteristics of two artists who worked at the beginning of the Third Style. The painting of Daedalus-Icarus published in colors in Baumeister's Denkmdler, pl. 22 and the Pegasus painting are by the same artist, as is a third painting in the same room, now almost destroyed, which represented Actaeon and Diana. A second artist painted another scene representing Daedalus and Icarus, as well as a Perseus and Andromeda and a Heracles and Hesione. Other paintings show the influence of these masters. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, pp. 268-295; 12 figs.; cf. Ibid. XV, 1912, pp. 143 ff.) Roman Wail Painting in the Second Century A.D.-H. KRIEGER (R6im. Mitt. XXXIV, 1919, pp. 24-52; 3 pls.) posits a fifth style of Roman wall painting harking back to the second in its simpler naturalistic use of architectural mo- tives but improving on it by the better handling of perspective. This is fol- lowed by a sixth style in which the architecture becomes more complicated again and which adopts and combines motives from all styles. INSCRIPTIONS An Imperial Rescript.-O. CUNTz publishes an imperial rescript of Septimius Severus and Caracalla dated October 14 of the year 205. It has to do with the centonarii of Solva. It was found at Solva, near Leipnitz, in Steiermark in 1915 and is now in the museum at Graz. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I.

EGGER discusses and restores a fragmentary Latin inscription found at Salona in 1911. It was a decree in honor of a certain C. Iulius [Ale]xianus who held various important offices. It dates from about 217 A.D. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, Beiblatt, cols. 293-322.) D. Simonius Julianus.-D. Simonius Julianus, who was praef. urb. A.D. 239, probably kept his office for five or six years. According to J. COLIN the lacuna in the inscription on the measure in Florence in which his name occurs probably contained the name of Philippus II. (B. Com. Rom. XLVII, 1919, pp. 3-10.) Valentinism and Gaia.-In an article on Valentinus and Valentinism (R. Arch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 131-145), SALOMON REINACH explains the last line of the epitaph of the Roman Valentinian woman raiF~ i Lav audr EL~ VKvor y'vor; 4 Ren68aor ; (Aigrain, manuel d'ipigraphie chritienne, No. 81) as a reference to a figure of Gaia rising from the earth with a gesture of surprise (cf. Reinach, Rip. Rel. III, 130, 187), a gesture which is itself a survival of the gesture of supplication such as is seen in representations of the battle of the gods and giants. COINS Mints of Vespasian.-H. MATTINGLY continues with an exhaustive article on the mints of Vespasian his study of the coinage of the civil wars of 68-69 A.D. (see Num. Chron. for 1914). The article is too long for brief summary, but is of the utmost importance for students of Roman coinage. (Num. Chron. 1921, pp. 187-225; 2 pls.) Third-Century Mints and Marks.-Mints and marks of the third century are at last thoroughly and systematically assembled and treated by PERCY H. WEBB. (Num. Chron. 1921, pp. 226-293.) Apollo Vejovis.-G. PIERFITTE discusses a type on the obverse of a denarius of the gens Cassia (Babelon, Monnaies de la Rbpublique romaine, Cassia, 7). The head which Babelon interprets as that of Bonus Eventus is more probably that of Apollo Vejovis. (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 44, 1915, pp. 57-61; pl.) GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Early Commerce of Latium.-Latin commerce from the Iron Age to the sixth century B.C. is the subject of a recent dissertation by LOUISE E. W. ADAMS. From literary tradition and archaeological evidence it is inferred that foreign traders, of whom the first were Phoenicians, visited the west coast of Italy in the early Iron Age, and that at this period trade in salt, iron, and bronze was carried on between different parts of Italy. Probably metals were transmitted to the Latins through Rome from Etruria. In general Latium was a backward dis- trict in comparison with the Etruscan region to the north and the Hellenized region to the south. In the seventh century the Etruscans controlled a trade route to the south, guarded by the fortress of Praeneste. Some Phoenician and Greek manufactures were imported into Latium. In the sixth century, which was marked by Greek predominance in the culture of Etruria, the Etrus- cans took possession of Rome and tried to convert it into a commercial centre. After the expulsion of the Etruscans the Romans were too much embarrassed by wars to take full advantage of their economic opportunities. The terms of</page><page sequence="23">ITAL. MISc.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 215 their early treaty with Carthage (Polybius, III, 22, 4), which seems to have been made in 509 B.c., show the indifference of the Latins to commerce, but also indicate that the Carthaginians foresaw, and sought to forestall the possible growth of Rome as a commercial power. [A Study in the Commerce of Latium from the Early Iron Age through the Sixth Century B.C., Smith College Classical Studies, No. 2; Northampton, Mass., 1921, Smith College; 84 pp.; 8vo. $0.75.] Etruscan Ships.-FRIEDERICH BEHN (Roim. Mitt. XXXIV, 1919, pp. 1-16) adduces evidence to prove that the Etruscan ships were closely related to the Phoenician and Minoan and radically different from the Greek. The Pomerium of Rome.-Numismatic evidence for the enlarging of the pomerium is adduced by LoDovIco LAFFRANCHI (B. Comrn. Rom. XLVII, 1919, pp. 16-44; pl.) for the following: Augustus, 27 and 7 B.c.; Trajan, 107 A.D.; Commodus, 189-190 A.D. The type of coin commemorating events of this sort is very similar to that celebrating the founding of a colony, viz. a pontifex plow- ing with a bull and a cow. The ius proferendo pomerii was conferred on the em- peror at his accession. The rite was intimately connected with the closing of the temple of Janus and the taking of the census. It did not necessarily refer to a particular conquest, but to all the annexations since the last enlarging of the pomerium. For Augustus, Trajan and Commodus monuments were erected in honor of the event. The Costume of the Oscan Woman.-MARGARGARETE LXNG discusses the cos- tume of the Oscan woman in the light of tomb frescoes and vase paintings. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1913, Beiblatt, cols. 233-252; 4 figs.) Attis on the Sainte Chapelle Cameo.-E. TXUBLER (Rom. Mitt. XXXIV, 1919, pp. 74-81) interprets the crouching figure adjacent to Livia-Cybele on the Sainte Chapelle cameo as Attis. He probably symbolizes grief over the fate of Germanicus. The cameo may have been cut under Claudius, who in- troduced Attis into the official Roman cult. Caesius Bassus.-M. MAYER (R6m. Mitt. XXXIV, 1919, pp. 107-114) rec- ognizes Caesius Bassus in the relief on a silver plate found in Russia, which was published by Pharmakowsky (Arch. Anz. 1908, p. 155 ff.). Notes on Two Roman Names.-E. GROAG (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, Beiblatt, cols. 265-280) traces the family connections of Q. Pompeius Sosius Priscus, consul 149, and of Bassaeus Astur. Ibid. XIX-XX, 1919, cols. 323- 328, he discusses the family of Ducenius Geminus. The Uniform of the Roman Soldier.-P. von BIENKOWSKI disedsses the uniform and armor of the Roman soldier in late imperial times. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, Beiblatt, cols. 261-280; 9 figs.) The Trade in Lead in Roman Times.-MAuRICE BESNIER completes his treatise on the trade in lead in Roman times. He describes and discusses ingots found in Northern Africa and in Italy. Those found in the sea off Mahdia, since the ship in which they were came from Athens, may perhaps be of Attic origin, though they resemble Spanish ingots. The same doubt affects one or two ingots found in Italy. As the Roman Empire decayed, Italy ceased to import lead from the British mines, but merely used over again the metal which had been imported in earlier times. (R. Arch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 98- 130; 7 figs.; recapitulary chart; epigraphic index. Cf. Ibid. XII, 1920, pp. 211-244; A.J.A.

XXVI, 1922 SPAIN A Stone Palette.-GEoRGE BONSOR publishes and discusses a stone palette with a bronze case, found in a tomb at La Caiada Honda, in the province of Seville, Spain. Other similar palettes have been found. They must have formed part of the toilette apparatus of Roman ladies. The case of this speci- men is adorned with a relief representing a nude woman seated between two Erotes. (R. Arch., fifth series, VIII, 1918, pp. 166-169; fig.) FRANCE Some Archaeological Aspects of Mediterranean Languedoc.-A~NoDR Jov- BIN has published a description and discussion of some archaeological aspects of southern or, as he prefers to call it, Mediterranean Languedoc. He describes the region, its climate, vegetation, and geological character. In ancient times a sea route passed through the lagoons of the coast, now deserted by vessels and, in part, filled with silt. Other trade routes were by land. The caves of the lower cation of the Gardon-especially that of La Baume-are described. Here are remains of palaeolithic and neolithic occupation. Especially towards the end of the neolithic period, objects from the eastern Mediterranean were im- ported. In the hypogaea of the mountain of Cordes and of Castellet, not far from Arles, resemblances to Mycenaean tombs and to monuments of the Balea- ric Islands, as well as imported objects, point to foreign settlement in the Bronze Age, if not earlier. At Montlaurbs, about five kilometers north of Nar- bonne, are traces of ancient dwellings and remains of pottery. Much of this last is of local manufacture, but much is imported ware from Greece and Italy. The earliest imported ware is Attic black-figured pottery of the sixth century B.c., including a fine Attic-Corinthian amphora. Fragments of Attic red-figured ware are more numerous, though the end of the sixth and the beginning of the fifth centuries are not represented. Similar conditions occur at Empurias (Emporion). At Montlaurbs was evidently a small Greek settlement sur- rounded by natives. Such early Greek settlements and intercourse with Greek traders may explain the ease with which Roman civilization was afterwards accepted. Maguelone, Villeneuve-ls-Maguelone, the stations of the pil- grimage route to Sant' Iago de Compostela, Saint-Guilhem-le-Dbsert, Saint- Martin-de-Londres, and Aigues Mortes, are discussed. Maguelone, a pro- tected island, dominated the neighboring region in the early Christian times. Devastated by Charles Martel in 737, it was not again important until the eleventh century. Little remains there now except the dismantled cathedral and the bishop's palace. The cathedral was built at different times, in the eleventh century, the first half of the twelfth century, and the second half of the twelfth century, and shows the characteristics of those dates. The sculptured lintel of the principal door, dated 1178, is related to the sculpture of St. Trophime at Arles. Villeneuve belongs chiefly to the twelfth century. The chief remaining feature is the much disfigured church of Saint Etienne. Of the four chief routes to Sant' Iago de Compostela, one followed the ancient Via Domitiana from Arles to Narbonne. Saint-Guilhem-le-D6sert is some 37 kilometers from this route, to the northward. The Guilhem who sanctified this place was a count of Toulouse in Charlemagne's time. The legend of his life and deeds was elaborated in the twelfth century. The monas-</page><page sequence="25">SWITZERLAND] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 217 tery and the bridge by which it was (and is) approached were built in the eleventh century. The church and ramparts of Saint-Martin-de-Londres be- long to the end of the eleventh century or to the twelfth. Aigues Mortes was an important port for three hundred years from the middle of the thirteenth century. Its fortifications are described. They belong to the thirteenth cen- tury, at least for the most part, and are almost entirely preserved. (R. Arch., fifth series, XII, 1920, pp. 269-309; XIII, 1921, pp. 37-78.) The So-Called Ancient Tomb of Neuvy-Pailloux.-ADRIEN BLANCHET dis- cusses the remains of a structure at Neuvy-Pailloux, between Thizay and Ville- saison. The structure was discovered in 1844 and was regarded as a tomb of a time earlier than the Roman conquest. The objects found in it are clearly Gallo-Roman. The building itself was not a tomb, but, in view of the number of amphorae found in it, a wine-shop or, more probably, a pavilion in which wine was stored and, perhaps, sometimes sold. A tripod with movable legs, found in the building, may have been a contrivance to hold up the mouth of an amphora, so that its contents could be poured out merely by raising the lower end of the vessel. (R. Arch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 81-97; 2 figs.) A Gallic Terra-cotta.-A terra-cotta statuette of a warrior in the Mus6e Saint-Raymond at Toulouse is published by C. LECRIVAIN. The peculiar tunic, as well as the form of the armor, shows that the subject is a Gallic soldier. (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 44, 1915, pp. 61-63; 2 figs.) Fortifications of Toulouse.-J. CHALANDE, continuing his studies of the an- cient fortifications of Toulouse, describes the remains of Roman and mediaeval date between the Porte Saint-Michel and the Porte Montgaillard. (B. Soc.

Roman Toulouse.-M. DE SANTI sketches the history and topography of Toulouse in Roman times (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 42, 1913, pp. 65-69.). J. CHALANDE describes the Roman and mediaeval fortifications of the Quartier Saint-Michel of the city (Ibid. pp. 76-84; fig.). SWITZERLAND Pre-Christian Cults of Geneva.-W. DEONNA, in a thoroughly documented and indexed monograph which has the proportions of a book rather than of an article, discusses the local cults of Geneva from the Palaeolithic Age to the Christian era. The study is based in great part on objects in the Mus6e d'Art et d'Histoire at Geneva. It includes a description of the early objects of per- sonal adornment found in this region, and of the evidence for cults of stones, of lakes and streams, of trees, of animals, of the key, the saw-toothed representa- tion of the solar disc, and of aniconic symbols; of anthropomorphic types, and certain pre-Roman divinities of Geneva; and of the several Roman gods who were worshipped there. A final chapter is devoted to the survival of certain Pagan influences and beliefs in the Christian period. (B. Inst. Gen. XLII, 1917, pp. 209-526; 104 figs.) Rhoeto-Romanic Villages.-B. REBER describes the remains of two ancient villages discovered by Abb6 Jolivet on the summit of Reculet in the Jura. The extant walls are of limestone blocks, not squared, but carefully fitted without</page><page sequence="26">218 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXVI, 1922 mortar. Structures are generally rectangular in plan, but each village con- tained a circular building, the use of which has not been ascertained. The villages are to be attributed to the Rhoeto-Romanic population which occupied this region before the invasions of the Alemanni in the third and fourth cen- turies A.D. (B. Gen. XLI, 1914, pp. 83-96; 3 figs.) AUSTRIA The Costume of the Pannonian Woman.-MARGARETE LXNG discusses the costume of the Pannonian woman as shown on the monuments. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XIX-XX, 1919, Beiblatt, cols. 207-260; 21 figs.) SWEDEN Firestones of the Iron Age.-HANNA RYDH describes and classifies firestones of the Iron Age. Her investigations have shown that primitive unshaped stones remained in use long after the invention of an artificially shaped form. The oldest finds of such primitive stones have been made in East Prussia, where they were associated with objects of the late La T~ne period. Stones found in Sweden can be dated in the first and second centuries A.D., and a fine oval stone was discovered at Eveb6 in Norway with a coin of Theodosius II. It appears that the period in which such stones were in use extends from the first century A.D. to the fifth. Many have been found in Sktne. (Fornvdnnen, XII, 1917, pp. 172-190; 20 figs., map.) The Star-form in Germanic Ornament.-The star motive in the ornamen- tation of Germanic metal work of the third and fourth centuries, especially as illustrated by examples from Sweden, is discussed by Nils Aberg. (Antik- varisk Tidskrift for Sverige, XXI, 3, pp. 1-51; 70 figs.) Weights of the Viking Period.-F. DE BRUN (Fornudnnen, XII, 1917, pp. 56-66), opposing the theory of T. J. Arne that the system of weights in Sweden during the Viking period was based on the Sassanid drachm (4.25 grammes), maintains that four systems of weights were in use (8.7, 8.4, 8.15, 7.85 grammes). Metal Ornaments from Gotland.-Metal objects discovered in graves of 550- 800 A.D. in Gotland are the subject of a descriptive article by BIRGER NERMAN. They include fibulae of various forms, and other articles of personal ornament. (Antikvarisk Tidskrift f6r Sverige, XXII, 4, pp. 1-102; 30 pls.; 16 figs.) GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND Flint Daggers in England.-R. A. SMrITH discusses the chronology of flint daggers discovered in England (Proc. Soc. Ant. XXXII, 1919-1920, pp. 6-21; 11 figs.). They are usually found in round barrows, and the English specimens may, therefore, be attributed to the post-neolithic period. Often they are asso- ciated with pottery beakers. Both pottery and daggers may have been im- ported into England by an invading people at the beginning of the Bronze Age. Bronze Bracelets from Cornwall.-Two bronze bracelets belonging to the Royal Institution of Cornwall, and presumably found in that region, are de- scribed by R. A. SMrITH (Proc. Soc. Ant.

A. SMITH discusses the significance of the gold crescents of early workmanship found in Ireland. They are probably to be associated with a cult of the moon, perhaps introduced into Ireland from Spain. (Ant. J. I, 1921, pp. 131-139; 5 figs.) NORTHERN AFRICA VOLUBILIS.-A Rider.-L. CHATELAIN publishes a bronze figure of a youth, found recently in the excavations at Volubilis. It was in several pieces but has been put together to form a complete whole. Certain details of the work make the hypothesis of its being a Greek original seem doubtful, but its Greek inspi- ration is perfectly evident, and the style is typical of the influence of Polyclitus or his school. The figure is unique in that it represents a type unknown today in any other example. (Gaz. B. A. III, 1921, pp. 1-6; pl.; 5 figs.)

There is also a general bibliography of the subject. [WV. F. VOLBACH, Elfenbeinarbeiten der Spatantike und des friihen Mittelalters. Kataloge des rom.-german. Central-Museums, No. 7. Mainz, 1916, L. Wilc- kens; 114 pp., 12 pls., 2 figs; 8vo.; 6 M.] The Cult of Poor Souls.-P. M. HALM discusses a cult important in late mediaeval times, which was based in large measure upon narrations given by the thirteenth century Caesarius von Heisterbach, though these derive in some cases from still earlier sources. The point of the stories reveals the miraculous benefits derived by absent or deceased persons from the prayers and offerings of the living. A whole cycle of illustrations-reliefs, paintings, and drawings- may be traced to this cult. Some are almost literal transcriptions of the stories told by the religious writers, others are more symbolical and complicated. (Miinch. Jb. XII, 1921, pp. 1-24; 15 figs.)</page><page sequence="28">220 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXVI, 1922 The Sun and the Moon in Crucifixions.-Louis HAUTECOEUR discusses the reasons for the presence of the sun and the moon in representations of the cru- cifixion, where they appear as early as the sixth century, at first in Syria. They had been associated with pagan deities-Isis, Serapis, Baal, Saturn, Mithra, Jupiter of Heliopolis and other solar and chthonic deities. This presence in crucifixions is in part due to syncretism, in part, no doubt, to artistic tradition and popular habit. (R. Arch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 13-32.) Romanesque Capitals in Nazareth.-P. EGIDI discusses the set of five almost perfectly preserved capitals found in 1908 on the grounds of the convent of the Annunciation at Nazareth. The writer conjectures that the capitals were intended to be used on a minor portal of the church which had only been com- menced when the attack upon the holy city in 1187 drove the Christians out of Nazareth. While the style of the work shows many points of similarity with the sculpture of Autun and V~zelay, it cannot be placed in that school. It was done by French artists, apparently under various oriental influences. (Dedalo, I, 1921, pp. 761-776; 15 figs.) A Christian Mosaic from Palestine.-O. M. DALTON discusses a detail of a mosaic pavement of the sixth century discovered at Umm Jerar near Gaza in 1917. It is a representation of a bird with a radiate nimbus, seated upon a nest in an object of curious shape. The bird is the phoenix, which is not seldom represented in early Christian art; while the object on which the nest rests is a Persian fire altar. The mosaic shows other evidence of Persian influence. (Proc. Soc. Ant. XXXII, 1919-1920, pp. 47-55; 2 figs.) A Sculptured Stone from Mesopotamia.-O. M. DALTON discusses a marble slab discovered at Miafarkin (Tigranocerta) in Northern Mesopotamia. It has reliefs on both sides, and it may have been part of an iconostasis, or may have filled the lower part of a light in a church window. The style of the re- liefs dates them in the period from the ninth to the thirteenth century. Of special interest is the representation of a double-headed eagle on one side of the stone. This symbol of power seems to have been introduced into European heraldry in imitation of the Seljuk Turks. But it occurs in the Orient in Hittite art. On the other side of the slab a fountain is twice represented; from it rises a stem crowned by a pine cone. The pine cone, a symbol of fertility in the cult of Mithra, passed into Christian symbolism in association with the Water of Life. (Proc. Soc. Ant. XXXII, 1919-1920, pp. 55-63; 3 figs.) A Byzantine Church near Megalopolis.-The church of the Holy Apostles at Leondari near Megalopolis is described by A. C. ORLANDOS (R. Et. Gr. XXXIV, 1921, pp. 163-176; 6 figs.). It is imitative of the Brontochion at Mistra, but some details indicate that it is of somewhat later date; and the pentagonal apse assigns it to the fourteenth century, which is the date of the earliest documen- tary evidence regarding it. ITALY Oderisi da Gubbio.-P. D'ANCONA takes as his point of departure for the study of Oderisi of Gubbio the passage in which Dante gives us a clue to the kind of work that artist did. Though heretofore we have known no certain work by Oderisi, what Dante says in comparing him with Francesco Bolognese leads the author to believe it possible to attribute to Oderisi a definite group of</page><page sequence="29">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 221 thirteenth century Bolognese miniatures showing strong French influence. (Dedalo, II, 1921, pp. 89-100; 7 figs.) The Altar of Sant' Ambrogio.-N. TARCHIANI (Dedalo, II, 1921, pp. 5-35; 5 p]s.; 10 figs.) gives the result of his study of the much disputed altar of gold in Sant' Ambrogio at Milan. While superintending the removal of the altar during the war, the author was able to examine it under unusually favor- able conditions. Besides a criticism of documentary material and a study of the technique and iconography of the work, he writes a full description of it and publishes complete and adequate photographic reproductions. The conclusion is that the original parts df the altar belong to the early decades of the ninth century; its Carolingian character is indicated by the technique and iconography and by the types of figures, which bear close similarity to those of such well-known Carolingian works as the Utrecht Psalter. Byzantine Mosaics of Sicily.-B. PACE shows how Sicilian art of the twelfth century, conforming in general iconography and style to Byzantine canons, yet departs from the latter in one significant point. It is characterized by an original display of realism. This may be clearly seen by comparing the mosaic of the Entrance into Jerusalem in the Palatine chapel, Palermo, with the mo- saic representation of the same subject in the church of Daphni. (Rass. d'Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 181-184; 3 fig.) The Art of Carnia.-G. FIocco writes on an exposition of art in remote Tol- mezzo in the heart of the Friulian Alps. The work is peculiarly interesting be- cause the isolation of the region has guarded the purity of its style through the centuries. The art is always pervaded by the quiet, peaceful spirit of the mountaineer, whose greatest joy through the long winter days was the employ- ment of his knife in wood carving. Naturally, the houses have many ornamen- tal carvings, but to the art historian the most interesting work is the carved altar pieces, headed by the fine productions of that well-known fifteenth cen- tury sculptor, Domenico da Tolmezzo. (Dedalo, I, 1921, pp. 669-689; 21 figs.) Two Romanesque Statues.-E. NICODEMI publishes the statues of Adam and Eve which adorn the portal of the twelfth century cathedral of Lodi and have previously had but slight literary notice. Prototypes are the figures on the ciborium of Sant' Ambrogio in Milan, the two caryatides of Sant' Antonio in Piacenza, and, for the Adam, Byzantine crucifixions. But the figures possess an expressive force which characterizes all the sculpture from Wiligelmo to the Antelami, and they are not lacking in originality, particularly the Eve, that almost seems to be moving in the severe liturgical dance. (Dedalo, I, 1921, pp. 738-742; 3 figs.) Primitives in the Vatican.-O. SIRkN writes a supplement to his article in L'Arte of 1906 on the early paintings in the Vatican. A more recent and more thorough study of the collection leads the author to a revision of some of his previous attributions, and he also fills some former omissions. Further, this later study is, in parts, a correction of the catalogue of the collection compiled by Dr. P. d'Achiardi. (L'Arte, XXIX, 1921, pp. 24-28, 97-102; 16 figs.) Barbaric Art of Nocera Umbra.-M. SALMI discusses the wealth of jewelry and other objects found in the barbarian necropolis of Nocera Umbra. (Rass. d'Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 152-157; 6 figs.) Lippo Memmi.-L. OZZOLA discusses Lippo Memmi in his collaboration with his father Memmo and with Simone Martini. Along with the work of Lippo</page><page sequence="30">222 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 in the Maest4 of the Palazzo Pubblico, San Gimignano, the hand of the father is to be recognized in the more primitive, Gothic figures of the right side. As to the work with Simone, the paramount example is the Uffizi Annunciation, signed by the two artists. Contrary to usual criticism, the two figures at the left, the Announcing Angel and S. Ansano, are given to Simone; the two at the right, the Virgin and S. Giulietta, because of their heavier treatment are, in exe- cution at least, though not in design, given to Lippo. (Rass. d'Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 117-121; 4 figs.) Two Paintings by Taddeo Gaddi.-R. OFFNER publishes two paintings, a Madonna in the church of S. Lorenzo alle Rose near Florence, and a St. John the Evangelist in the Gentner collection, Worcester, Mass., which he attributes, on the basis of relationship to authentic paintings, to Taddeo Gaddi. The Madonna is to be dated about 1355, the St. John about 1340-50. (L'Arte, XXIV, 1921, pp. 116-123; 7 figs.) Giotto's Last Judgment.-The Last Judgment of the Arena Chapel in Padua is the subject of a discussion by A. FORATTI (Boll. Arte, I, 1921, pp. 49-66; 15 figs.) in which it is shown how little is taken by Giotto from predecessors and how much of the composition is his own invention. It is the freest product of fourteenth century art. Dante the Painter.-Taking as his point of departure Dante's description in La Vita Nuova of his own attempt at painting, H. COCHtN (Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1921, pp. 65-80; pl.; 5 figs.) discusses the high value which Dante put upon painters, his theory of painting, which comes out in the Divine Comedy, and the picto- rial character of his poetry. Dante eulogizes naturalistic qualities in painting, and all through his poetry he betrays the spirit of a painter in his simple, vivid descriptions of scenes. A Note to Purgatorio X, 55-63.-J. SHAPLEY uses Dante's description of one of the reliefs in Purgatory as the point of departure for a discussion of the rela- tionship of illustration, particularly the illustration of Dante, to' literature. The effects of the two arts upon the various senses constitute the main problem involved, though the problem of unity is also important in the translation of the literary into the pictorial. (Art Bulletin, IV, 1921, pp. 19-26; 5 figs.) The Tomb of Pietro Alighieri.-L. COLETTrI gives something of the history of Pietro Alighieri, elder son of Dante, a notable lawyer not unworthy his paren- tage, and discusses the sepulchral monument set up for him at Treviso, where he died. The monument, by the Venetian sculptor, Ziliberto fu Mauro Santo, has been dismembered and some parts have been lost; but its character can be surmised from the remaining parts and from the monument of the bishop Salomone Castellano, which Pietro's tomb simulated in large part, though the style of its sculpture is more realistic, less refined, and less Pisan than that of the bishop's. The parts of Pietro's tomb that remain are his own statue, the figures of two virtues that supported the baldacchino, and the coats of arms. They are in the chapter library at Treviso. (Rass. d' Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 315-324; 6 figs.) Wooden Sculpture.-C. GRADARA writes on the development of wooden sculpture in the Abruzzi. This region was active in the art from the thirteenth century on. Much of the work consists in furniture decoration, but from the fourteenth century through the seventeenth large figure compositions are</page><page sequence="31">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 223 abundant. A group of Madonnas from various churches is here published. (Rass. d' Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 270-274; 6 figs.) Florentine Textiles.-G. SANGIORCGI describes the changes in the style of figured textiles when, after the death of Manfredi, the industry was transferred from Sicily to Florence and neighboring towns. The oriental character of the designs was lost and the compositions used in Florentine painting were copied for more than two centuries. In many instances the paintings which inspired directly or indirectly certain textile designs may be recognized. (Dedalo, II, 1921, pp. 153-169; pl.; 17 figs.) Feminine Costume of the Trecento.-From passages in contemporary litera- ture and from paintings of the time, C. LA FERLA (L'Arte, XXIV, 1921, pp. 55- 70; 21 figs.) studies costumes worn by women in the fourteenth century. Their elaborate design, their harmonious coloring, and their wealth of jeweled ornament, particulary as seen in Sienese examples, were no doubt due in no small degree to oriental influence. A Picture of St. Ursula.-O. SIREN attributes to the North Italian painter, Guariento, a painting of St. Ursula with her maidens (property of Mr. F. Stein- mayer, Lucerne), which is unusually attractive in color and design. (Burl. Mag. XXXIX, 1921, pp. 169-170; pl.) Umbrian Primitives.-M. SALMI studies early Umbrian paintings as repre- sented in collections at Perugia. (L'Arte, XXIV, 1921, pp. 155-171; 20 figs.) Textile Designs in Italian Paintings.-I. ERRERA places side by side with paintings dating from the fourteenth to the end of the sixteenth century exam- ples of extant textiles in which the same designs occur that are found in the draperies of figures in the paintings. Such a study throws light both upon the sources of influence in the paintings and upon the dates of the textiles, often showing that certain textile designs originated much earlier than has hitherto been supposed. (Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1921, pp. 143-158; 21 figs.) A Reliquary Casket in Capodistria.-A. GNIRS describes a reliquary casket, 30 cm. long, 16 cm. wide and 11.5 cm. high, in Capodistria. It is of oak covered with carved plates of bone which were once gilded. On each of the long sides and on top are three panels, each containing a figure. A border of rosettes, or "stars," surrounds the whole and separates the panels. On one end two men appear fighting; and on the other are four heads in circles, all enclosed by the same border. The casket dates from the twelfth century. (Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XVIII, 1915, pp. 138-144; pl.; 4 figs.) SPAIN AND PORTUGAL Valencian Silversmith Work.--E. TORMO publishes two Valencian proces- sional crosses, one in Jitiva, the other in Onteniente. The latter is documen- tarily dated 1392-93 as the work of a Valencian silversmith, Pedro Capellades. The one in Jitiva is so close to this in general style that it undoubtedly belongs to the same period, and it seems likely that its author was Pedro Bernis. Both crosses are richly decorated with relief and enameled paintings and are of great importance in portraying the character of Valencian silversmith work in the latter part of the fourteenth century. (B. Soc. Esp. XXVIII, 1921, pp. 193- 204; 2 pls.) Spanish Defensive Houses and Towers.-The character of the building ac- tivity of the fifteenth century in the region of La Montafia is described by L. T.</page><page sequence="32">224 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 BALBAS (Arquitectura, No. 30, 1920, pp. 279-283; pl.; fig.). The most charac- teristic feature was the tower, built for defense, and the most complete extant example is in Espinosa de los Monteros (Burgos). The Royal Monastery of Sigena.-R. DEL ARCo traces the long and com- plicated history of the great monastery of Sigena and describes its architecture and the monuments preserved in it. The monastery was founded in the late twelfth century and its con- struction covers a period from the twelfth century to the sixteenth century. It has been a veritable museum of sculpture and painting and still retains not a few examples of importance. (B. Soc.Esp. XXIX, 1921, pp. 26-63; 3 pls.; 3 figs.) The Ruins of Ayll6n.-P. ARTIGAS describes the ruins of the thirteenth century Romanesque church of Ayll6n with its later additions. The church has a single nave, with rectangular choir, cylindrical apse, and square tower. Contrasting with its severe simplicity are the sumptuous sixteenth century chapels and tombs which it shelters. (B. Soc. Esp. XXVIII, 1921, pp. 205-215; 2 pls.) The Monastery of Ermelo.- F. ALVES PEREIRA describes the Romanesque structure of the Monastery of Ermelo, which is situated thirteen kilometers from Arcos de Valdevez in Portugal. (O Archeologo Portuguis, XXIII, 1918, pp. 138-158; 22 figs.) FRANCE Romanesque Sculpture.-R. VAN MARLE publishes a number of twelfth century French sculptures in American collections, gives a brief study of the schools to which they belong, and makes comparisons between those schools. A statue of the king of Judah in the Metropolitan Museum i8 assigned to the school of Berry. The bust of St. Peter (Fig. 4) recently ac- quired by the Rhode Island School of Design belongs to the school of Bur- gundy, bearing especially close similarities to certain statues of the Sainte Croix church at La Charit&amp;-sur-Loire. A crowned and bearded head in the Fogg Art Museum, which has been attributel to the school of Poitou, must have been done by artists from the atelier which produced the ornamentation of the church of St. Pierre at Moissac.

Finally, a wooden figure of Christ (from a Descent from the Cross) in the same collection may be attributed, by com- parison with a similar figure in the Louvre, to the school of Auvergne. (Art in America, X, 1921, pp. 3-16; 10 figs.) Frescoes at Albi.-The Abb6 AURIOL describes some of the frescoes of the church of Saint-Cecile at Albi. (1) On the vault of the nave the Transfigura- tion is represented. This subject, never entirely neglected in the Middle Ages, was chosen with special frequency by artists of the fifteenth century, since it was in this period that the Feast of the Transfiguration was established by Pope Calixtus III, in commemoration of the defeat of Mahomet II at Belgrade. (2) In the chapel of Sainte Croix the appearance of Christ to the sleeping Constan- tine is depicted. The cross itself, which is lacking in this picture, is to be found in the ornamentation of the vault above, surrounded by angels and cherubs; and it is shown not in a simple form, but in imitation of the richly jewelled reliquary cross, containing a fragment of the True Cross, which was preserved in this church. (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 43, 1914, pp. 179-185; pl.) A Romanesque Church.-F. PASQUIER calls attention to the interest of the church of Saint-Pierre at Lavernose, a structure of the school of Poitou. Al- though considerably altered and disguised by restorations, the building deserves a place among historic monuments. (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 43, 1914, pp. 202-205.) A Relief of the Trinity.-A. CouzI describes a relief representing the Trinity in a niche at the entrance of the church of Villefranche-le-Lauruguais (Haute- Garonne). The emotion depicted on the face of God the Father shows that the date is the fifteenth century. This is not a conventional Gothic face, but recalls a local type. The relief was probably a votive offering. (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 43, 1914, pp. 330-332; pl.) A Pieth at Toulouse.-A. Couzi describes a Gothic Pieth of wood in the Nazareth oratory at Toulouse. (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 44, 1915, pp. 156-159; pl.) Horses in Romanesque Sculpture.-Horses and their harness as represented on the Romanesque capitals of the twelfth century in the Museum of Toulouse are discussed by J. DE LAHONDES. He shows that certain details are appro- priate only to the period to which the capitals are attributed. (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 43, 1914, pp. 303-306.) The Church of Sain-Bel.-J. TRIcou publishes three drawings by A. Cate- land, illustrating the small Romanesque church of Sain-Bel in the Rhone dis- trict. The church is threatened with destruction because of plans for a large modern church on the site. (Bulletin Historique du Diocese de Lyon, 1922, pp. 30-33; 3 figs.) A Sculptured Lintel.-A. CouzI describes the primitive reliefs on the lintel of the door of the church of Sainte-Marie, at Bagiry (Haute-Garoinne). In the centre is a coat-of-arms, with the date 1498. At the right is represented the Crucifixion, with the Virgin and St. John. At the left is the figure of St. Peter, in chasuble and conical tiara, carrying an enormous key. (B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 42, 1913, pp. 146-147; fig.) Romanesque Capitals at Toulouse.-A series of eight Romanesque capitals in one of the portals of Saint-Sernin at Toulouse has hitherto been interpreted</page><page sequence="34">226 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL.

(B. Soc. Arch. Midi, 44, 1915, pp. 63-71; pl.) Processional Cross.-W. L. HILDBURGH has published a description of an English bronze processional cross of the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, a pair of mediaeval enamelled basins (gemellions), a candlestick with folding legs, shown by the arms enamelled on the supports to be of about 1310, two fragments of mediaeval Limoges enamel, a small copper image of the Virgin, possibly made at Limoges in the thirteenth century, and two bronze rood figures, one of which was probably made in or near Auvergne, about 1100, while the other is possibly German.

BELGIUM AND HOLLAND Early Goldsmith Work.-In the first of his series of articles on the early thirteenth century goldsmiths of Oignies, near Namur, H. P. MITCHELL (Burl. Mag. XXXIX, 1921, pp. 157-169; 3 pls.) attributes to Hugo, on the basis of stylistic similarity to signed work, the upper part of a reliquary in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The foot of the reliquary is believed to be the work of the late thirteenth century Mosan school. The Altarpiece of the Lamb by the Van Eycks and Talismanic Engraved Stones.-F. DE MALY explains some of the inscriptions on the altarpiece of the Lamb as magic words or abbreviations such as are found on engraved stones used as talismans. ADONAI=Lord; AGLA is made up of the initials of the Hebrew words Atar Gibor Lailam Adonai, and is found on many mediaeval objects. It served to ward off disease, fire, and enemies, and also to bring love. HONI, also written "huni" is Hebrew, signifying "Thanks (to God);" like AGLA it is of benefit to women in child birth. MEIAPARO, on the border of the bodice of the Cumaean sibyl in the altarpiece, is a mis-spelled translitera- tion of 'Piva ~rap' 6?OaXpav, Iliad, V, 291, a passage which was used as a talis- man of victory. The mediaeval artists used many languages and also cryptic alphabets. Examples of these are given and their magic use is illustrated. The inscription on the altarpiece, which records the names of the painters and the dedicator, reads according to Napoleon de Pauw (Bulletin de la Commission royale d'histoire de Belgique, V, 1921). Pictor Hubertus e Eyclc, major quo nemo repertus Incepit pondus, quod Johannes in arte secundus Suscepit fratri, Judoci Vijd prece freti Versu sexta Ma'i vos collocat acta tueri. (R. Arch., fifth series, XIV, 1921, pp. 33-48; 8 figs.) Identification of some Figures in the Ghent Altarpiece.-P. POST presents evidence to prove that the recognition of Jan and Hubert van Eyck among the Just Judges of the Ghent altarpiece is groundless, and that, instead, the four first figures represent Philip the Good, John the Fearless, Philip the Bold, and Ludwig von Male, the four successive counts under whose rule Jodokus Vydt, the donor of the altarpiece, lived (Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XLII, 1921, pp. 67-81; 7 figs.). Such an interpretation helps in the solution of some of the difficult problems connected with the altarpiece. For example, it destroys the evidence</page><page sequence="35">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 227 for the usual belief that there was a great discrepancy in the ages of Hubert and Jan van Eyck; and, more important than this, it leads to the conclusion that Hubert was the author of the panel of the Just Judges, since his death in 1426 explains the omission of the chain of the Golden Fleece from the neck of Philip the Good. Jan, who began his work on the altarpiece in 1430, would have shown the chain, for the duke acquired it early in that year. This proof, that Hubert was the author of this wing, is a confirmation of the author's earlier conclusion based on the Turin Book of Hours (see Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. 1919, pp. 208 f.). GERMANY The St. George Choir of Bamberg Cathedral.-R. KiMSTEDT studies the choir of St. George in the east end of the cathedral of Bamberg, showing how it was developed in the early years of the thirteenth century from two different ground plans. (Miinch. Jb. XII, 1921, pp. 25-37; 9 figs.) A Garment of Emperor Heinrich II.-R. BERLINER makes a detailed study of the remains of a garment now in the Bavarian National Museum, which have been, and justly, as the author concludes, looked upon as coming from a gar- ment originally belonging to Emperor Heinrich II. This garment early came into the possession of the Bamberg cathedral, among the treasures of which it is listed in the invoice of 1127. At various times through the centuries, until the eighteenth, it underwent partial restorations; but some of the original work is still to be seen. Sassanian influence is observable in the embroid- ery; its style is like that of Byzantine stuffs of Persian style in the Maze- donian period. (Miinch. Jb. XII, 1921, pp. 45-60; 13 figs.) An Augsburg Family of Painters.-K. FEUCHTMAYR, taking as his point of departure an altar wing in the Louvre representing the Adoration of the Magi, develops the history of the artistic activity of a late Gothic family of Augsburg named Apt. Ulrich Apt the Elder is shown to have been the master who in 1510 painted the Louvre Adoration, and to him may be assigned earlier and later works. He was best as a portrait painter, mirroring what he saw about him. He made but little advance upon the past; he summed up, rather, its peculiarities in his own creations. Paintings which may be attributed to his sons and other members of his studio have the same fundamental character- istics as do those of the elder Apt. (Miinch. Jb. XI, 1921, pp. 30-61; 18 figs.) Mediaeval Art ih Colmar.-C. CHAMPION writes on the superb art collection of the Underlinden Museum (the thirteenth century convent) in Colmar. It comprises, among other things, much of the best work of mediaeval Rhenish art from Isenmann to Schongauer and Grfinewald. (Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1921, pp. 1-22; pl.; 15 figs.) POLAND A Romanesque Bronze Door.-Through an analysis of the style and incono- graphical details of the bronze door of the cathedral of Gnesen in Posen (one of the most venerable monuments of ancient Poland), C. FURMANKIEWICZ (Gaz. B.-A. III, 1921, pp. 361-370; pl.; 7 figs.) dates the work and ventures a hypothesis as to its authorship. The scenes represent the life of St. Adalbert, and it is particularly in the details of costumes and liturgical accessories, French Romanesque in their origin, that the key is given to the date, which 8</page><page sequence="36">228 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 must be the first half of the twelfth century. The knowledge displayed concern- ing ecclesiastical forms and costumes, as well as the general character of the work, conforms with what would be expected from the artist Leopardus, known only documentarily. SWEDEN The So-Called Birka Coins.-L. KJELLBERG discusses the so-called Birka coins of which the greater number have been found on the island of Bjirki (Birka). They belong to the ninth and tenth centuries, and are made in imi- tation of the Dorstadt denarii of Charlemagne and of Louis the Pious. They are entirely lacking in Christian symbols, and are the work of native de- signers. (Fornvtinnen, XII, 1917, pp. 41-46.) Coins of Knut Eriksson.-G. GALSTER attributes to the period of Knut Eriksson (ca. 1200 A.D.) and his successor a series of coins from Sodermanland which H. Hildebrand assigned to the Swedish king Waldemar, 1250-1275. (Fornvinnen, XII, 1917, pp. 96-101; 4 figs.) GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND The Breadalbane Brooch.-Sir C. H. READ and RI. A. SMITH describe (Proc. Soc. Ant. XXXII, 1919-1920, pp. 63-66; pl.) a beautiful silver brooch from the Breadalbane collection, recently acquired by the British Museum. Its orna- ment of filigree interlaces, birds' heads, and inset colored glass is characteristic of Irish and Scotic work of the eighth century. An Ivory Panel.-O. M. DALTON describes a triangular panel of ivory found at St. Cross and now in the Winchester Museum. On it are represented two angels, back to back. The workmanship has remarkable delicacy and vitality, and is to be attributed to an English craftsman of about 1000 A.D. (Proc. Soc. Ant. XXXII, 1919-1920, pp. 45-57; fig.) English Alabaster Tables.-A series of English alabaster tables and images is described by W. L. HILDBURGH (Proc. Soc. Ant. XXXII, 1919-1920, pp. 117- 129; 6 figs.). One, only a fragment, is a part of a representation of the Assump- tion. A second, also a fragment, shows three figures, one of whom is St. Ed- ward the Confessor. On a third panel the Betrayal of Christ is portrayed. An alabaster image, obtained in France, represents St. Barbara. Ten fragments of tables come from the church of St. Andrew at Wotton, and show scenes in the Life of the Virgin. In addition to these examples in England, a number of English alabaster carvings now in Spain are described. Alabaster Carvings.-W. L. HILDBURGH describes (Ant. J. I, 1921, pp. 222- 231; 2 pls.; 4 figs.) a number of English alabaster carvings, including (1) a group of four reliefs of unknown provenance, representing the Carrying of the Cross, the Deposition, the Entombment, and the Resurrection; (2) a table representing the Ascension, remarkable in the fact that the figure of Christ is represented in full length; (3) a panel showing the consecration of an archbishop, probably Becket or William of York; (4) a table showing St. James and St. John; (5) images of St. Christopher.</page><page sequence="37">RENAISSANCE ARTI ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 19921 229 RENAISSANCE ART ITALY Leonardo and Boltraffio.-Contending that Leonardo himself, and not Boltraffio, is the author of La Belle Ferronnibre in the Louvre, C. HOLMES (Burl. Mag. XXXIX, 1921, pp. 107-108; 2 pls.) reproduces the portrait of a youth in the collection of Sir Philip Sassoon, in which he sees the characteristics of Bol- traffio as contrasted with those of his master. Boltraffio appears as a more sensitive colorist, but as a less perfect designer and craftsman. A Drawing by Leonardo for the Leda.-A drawing of a female head in the museum of the Castello Sforzesco, Milan, is suggested by A. VENTURI (L'Arte, XXIX, 1921, p. 42; pl.) to be not the work of Antonio Bazzi but of Leonardo himself. The turn of the head and the suave and delicate treatment through- out the work places it in the master's late period, close to the St. Anne of the Louvre. And it seems not a far fetched hypothesis to see in the drawing a study for the standing Leda, the Leda freely copied by Raphael in the Windsor drawing and by many followers of Leonardo in painting. The Crucifixion in S. Maria delle Grazie.-The collaboration of Leonardo with Donato Montorfano in the Crucifixion in the refectory of S. Maria delle Grazie is discussed by L. BELTRAMI (Rass. d'Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 217-232; 11 figs.). The conclusion is that Montorfano in 1494-95 completed the whole composition, including the outlines of the four figures in the ducal family. The coloring of these figures was left for Leonardo. Between 1497 and 1499 Leo- nardo painted these figures in oil. His technique was somewhat different from that used in his Last Supper because for the ducal family Montorfano had already put on the ground treatment for fresco. Leonardo did not slavishly conform to the outlines made by his predecessor. How much freedom he allowed himself is indicated by his introduction of a Moorish servant behind Ludovico. Drawings by Giambellinno and Raphael.-A. VENTURI publishes two draw- ings in the Pinacoteche Civiche at Brescia (L'Arte, XXIX, 1921, pp. 7-9; 2 figs.). One, representing the Entombment, is an excellent example of the work of Giambellino. The other, formerly attributed to Perugino, is one of the most complete of extant drawings by Raphael. The only thing lacking to make it a complete picture is the color. The same author writes on three drawings by Raphael in the Teyler Museum in Haarlem (Ibid. pp. 19-23; 4 figs.). One is a putto similar to the one used by Raphael in the chamber of Pope Julius and in the fresco of Sant' Agostino at Rome. The second is a study of an eques- triafi group for the Attila. The third is a sketch for the Marriage of Alexander and Roxana painted by Sodoma in the Farnesina. Still other drawings by Raphael are published by A. VENTURI (Ibid. pp. 49-54; 7 figs.). They belong to the Oppenheimer collection in London and to the Windsor Library, and in- clude a study for a musician, two hands, a design for a platter, and studies for the Disputa, the Attila, and the Loggia. Paintings by Correggio.-R. LONGHI publishes a St. Jerome in the Academy of S. Fernando, Madrid, and a Holy Family in the Museum of Orlhans, which he attributes to the early period of Correggio, to about 1515 (L'Arte, XXIX, 1921, pp. 1-6; 2 figs.). A. VENTURI publishes a painting in the Hofmuseum at Vienna, which there bears the name of Lelio Orsi da Novellara (Ibid. p. 33; fig.).</page><page sequence="38">230 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

In spite of its damaged condition, its qualities are suffi- ciently Correggiesque to suggest the hand of the master himself. Fifteenth Century Leather Work.-P. CAMPETTI publishes a beautiful fifteenth century tooled leather casket in the cathedral at Lucca (Dedalo, II, 1921, pp. 240-250; 9 figs.). It is decorated with colored compositions in relief representing scenes from the life of Christ (Fig. 5). F.

The love scene depicted on the outside is in the style of Pisanello. Sixteenth Century Roman Ceramics.-U. GNOLI writes on the sixteenth cen- tury humanist, Giovanni Goritz of Luxemburg, and of Domenico Gnoli's search for the manuscripts and other treasures hidden by Goritz during the sack of Rome in the garden of his home at the foot of the Campidoglio. Besides many fragments, only two pieces of ceramics were found, a plate and a candlestick. These are now owned by the author of the article. (Dedalo, II, 1921, pp. 199- 202; 2 figs.) Sixteenth Century Mirror Frames.-L. DAMI publishes a number of Italian mirror frames, mostly Florentine, which he dates from the beginning to past the middle of the sixteenth century. They were all destined to be hung on the wall, as opposed to hand mirrors, and the emphasis is always upon the frame rather than upon the mirror. A few have circular glasses, but in nearly all cases the glass is rectangular and there is usually a sliding door to cover it, apparently because its glitter would interfere with the effect of the carved and colored frame. Architectural features are generally used in the adornment, and the frame takes on the semblance of a door, a tabernacle, or a window. (Dedalo, I, 1921, pp. 625-642; pl.; 12 figs.) A "Mariegola."-R. BRATTI writes on the "'Mariegola" (Mater Regula) of the Calafati in the Arsenal at Venice. It is an example of the richly bound and illuminated volumes in which the art corporations of Venice recorded their rules</page><page sequence="39">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 231 and laws. It was finished in the second half of the sixteenth century and com- pares in the magnificence of its cast silver binding and its rich miniatures by Giorgio Colonna with such a monument as the Grimani breviary. (Dedalo, II, 1921, pp. 169-180; 7 figs.) Petrarch's Tomb.-A. CALLEGARI outlines the vicissitudes of the tomb of Petrarch in Arqu&amp;, with special reference to the bronze bust of the poet which adorns the sarcophagus. This bust, made and put in place in 1547 at the order of Paolo Valdezocco, is of much greater interest upon close examination than one can realize from the usual point of view. Of a little more than life size, it presents a serious, contemplative interpretation of the subject. In itself, it does not add anything new to the iconography of the poet. But it is signifi- cant that among all the portraits of Petrarch in Padua the sculptor has chosen as his prototype the fresco in the Sala dei Giganti, indicating that in the mid- sixteenth century this fresco enjoyed the greatest fame in Padua as a true likeness of Petrarch. (Dedalo, I, 1921, pp. 723-728; pl.; 2 figs.) Fifteenth Century Wooden Sculpture.-L. SERRA publishes three unusually fine wooden statues, which show how high a plane this art reached in the more remote regions of Italy. The examples under discussion were produced in the Marches. A very simply designed but animated Virgin and Announcing Angel lately acquired by the National Gallery of Urbino are less well preserved but probably not less fine in their way than the dignified hieratic Madonna della Misericordia of the Accademia Georgica at Treia. (Dedalo, I, 1921, pp. 693-697; pl.; 4 figs.) Tintoretto's Drawings.-D. FREIHERR VON HADELN describes the masterly quality of Tintoretto's drawings, choosing for illustration only a few out of the great number of extant examples. It is noticeable that practically all rep- resent single figures. This observation leads to an investigation into Tin- toretto's manner of giving visual form to his compositions before painting them. Instead of making drawings of them, he made wax models. His method of procedure seems to have been as follows: On an elaborate scaffolding, placed at the desired height with reference to the eye, the artist arranged his composi- tion with wax figures. Before this composition in three dimensions he stretched a net. His large canvas was marked off into squares corresponding to the squares of this net, and sections were marked off on drawing sheets. Then studies were drawn of the single figures, and these were transferred to the can- vas before the final painting was begun. (Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XLII, 1921,.pp. 82-103, 169-189; 29 figs.) A Portrait of Piero de' Medici.--T. DE MARINIS discusses the full-page portrait of a youth in the 1488 edition of Homer in the Biblioteca Nazionale, Naples. There are several reasons for concluding that this is a portrait of Piero de' Medici. First, the portrait agrees with the age of Piero at this time and is sufficiently like other known representations of him, notably, the portrait in Ghirlandaio's fresco in the Sassetti chapel in Santa Trinita. Second, the copy of the Homer in which this portrait appears is dedicated to Piero. Third, a portrait in an illuminated border of the book represents the same person and is distinctly referred to in the dedication as Piero. A critical study of the paint- ing of the full-page portrait indicates Ghirlandaio himself as its author. (De- dalo, II, 1921, pp. 38-46; pl.; 2 figs.) Ghiberti's Glazed Terra-cotta.-W. voN BODE shows that in certain terra-</page><page sequence="40">232 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 cotta reliefs which may be attributed to Ghiberti the artist has made attempts at glazing. The reliefs representing the story of Adam and Eve on a chest in the Victoria and Albert Museum and on a fragment of its companion piece in the Museo dell' Opera del Duomo, Florence, are treated with a tin glaze; a relief of the Madonna and Child in the Volpi collection, Florence, has a lead glaze. The experiments were not very successful, but they bore fruit in inspiring the younger artist, Luca della Robbia, to continue the attempts and to perfect the technique. (Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XLII, 1921, pp. 51-54; pl.; 3 figs.) Michele da Verona.-T. BORENIUS offers a brief study of Michele da Verona, whose Crucifixion in the Brera, dated 1501, forms the best touchstone for other attributions. Venetian influence upon the artist is seen in his allegorical scene, owned by Lady Horner, here reproduced for the first time. Of special icono- graphical interest is a drawing of the Trial of Moses in Mr. A. P. Opp6's collec- tion. (Burl. Mag. XXXIX, 1921, pp. 3-4; pl.; 2 figs.) Francia's Portrait.-E. E. C. JAMES publishes a portrait of a man from the Campana collection in Rome and now in the museum at Angers, which she be- lieves to be a self-portrait of Francesco Francia, the one he sent to his friend Raffaello in 1508. A portrait in the Boschi collection evidently portrays the same man some years earlier. (Burl. Mag. XXXIX, 1921, p. 89; 2 figs.) Drawings by Pisanello.-Two drawings of stags, studies for the Sant' Eustachio painting, are published by A. VENTURI (L'Arte, XXIV, 1921, pp. 90- 96; figs.). They are from the Bonnat collection in Paris. Other interesting drawings from this collection are a study for the reverse of the medal of Alfonso of Aragon, studies of leaves and flowers, and a representation of the Santo of Padua as it was in the artist's day. Finally, an unusually fine and naturalistic drawing of a dromedary is published from the Windsor Library. Paintings by Piero della Francesca.-Two panels representing St. Clara and St. Dominic in the Liechtenstein Gallery, Vienna, are attributed by A. VENTURI (L'Arte, XXIV, 1921, pp. 152-154; 2 figs.) to Piero della Francesca. Appar- ently they originally formed parts of a polyptych. They belong to about the same time as the Madonna with Angels of Sinigallia. The Mask of Dante.-The so-called mask of Dante, which exists in so many duplicates, is the basis of a study by C. Ricci (Rass. d'Arte, VIII, 1921, pp. 289- 294; 6 figs.). Apparently the one from which all the others are cast or modelled is that in the Dante Museum at Ravenna; for it is the one that came into the possession of John of Bologna and later was in Tacca's studio, where there were many sculptors to copy it. But that even it is not actually a mask taken from the face of the poet is shown by a careful study of it. The soft lines of the face, the full treatment of the lips, the open eyes, the indication of the cap, etc., to say nothing of the beauty of modelling, indicate that it is the work of a sculp- tor or cast from the work of a sculptor. Ricci believes, from comparing the work with the head of Guidarello Guidarelli, that its sculptor was Tullio Lom- bardi. The Cleopatra of the Louvre.-C. MARCEL-REYMOND calls attention to the fact that the Cleopatra in the Louvre attributed to Gianpetrino is another instance of the great influence Leonardo's Leda had upon the art of the six- teenth century and investigates the attribution of the Cleopatra. That it has been assigned to Gianpetrino seems to have resulted from the general tendency to attribute to that painter all nudes, especially the numerous half-length</page><page sequence="41">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 233 figures of nudes that are related closely or distantly to the Milanese school that followed Leonardo. In reality, the character of this painting gives it to the school of Sodoma, if not to that master himself. (Gaz. B.-A. IV, 1921, pp. 211-224; 9 figs.) The Visconti Venosta Collection.-C. GAMBA describes the Visconti Venosta collection (Dedalo, I, 1921, pp. 506-534; pl.; 26 figs.). This is of particular interest because Visconti Venosta found time in spite of his active diplomatic career for intimacy with Morelli and Cavanaghi, whose combined efforts made i a ... i B I i ~fl~'l ~I 18 PB B~i~ii~~CI' Sr II i- -ii ~i; it~il~t~i ~Bdl-~ i~i~4~i~tssl?a~a~c~~j~c~r g~fB~ ^~i:.~~~-~-l*c-?~ I:?VC;";- C' -"9*i~""-?~~?"

Although its treasures are known singly the effect of its total riches presented by Gamba is surprising. Among significant things may be mentioned examples of Italian and northern minor arts (furnishings and utensils), sculpture, and a thoroughly representa- tive collection of Italian painting beginning with the time of the Giottesques (Figs. 6-7). The Villa d'Este at Tivoli.-The history of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli is the subject of a recent article by VINCENZO PACIFICI.

XXVI, 1922 SPAIN A Painting by Navarette.-B. G. MuR publishes a painting of St. John on Mount Patmos (in the collection of the author) which he shows to be the paint- ing for which King Philip II gave a commission in 1571 to Juan Fernandez Navarrete (called El Mudo). The painting is full of Venetian qualities and helps to characterize its author as "the Spanish Titian." (B. Soc. Esp. XXVIII, 1920, pp. 216-225; pl.) A Spanish Collection.-J. PENUELAS describes some paintings in the collec- tion of D. F6lix Labat. Among the treasures are a fourteenth century Italian Madonna, showing Byzan- tine influence (possibly to be at- tributed to Lorenzo Veneziano), a Madonna by Botticelli, a Holy Family by Raphael or a follower, two paintings by El Greco, two by Zurbaran, and several examples of northern schools, attributed to Van der Goes, Mabuse, etc. (B. Soc. Esp. XXIX, 1921, pp. 72-77; 2 pls.) Spanish Renaissance Houses.- The Marquis of LozoYA describes a number of Renaissance houses of Segovia (B. Soc. Esp. XXIX, 1921, pp. 85-95; 2 pls.). While church architecture clung to the Gothic style far into the Renaissance period, the new style was early adopted for domestic building. Engineers and sculptors came from Avila and Valladolid, but their style was necessarily modified by the new conditions which they had to meet, particularly by the character of the material offered by the region. The fact that they had to use granite for much of their work im- posed a general simplicity 'and soberness upon the decoration. The same author discusses the houses of the reign of Henry IV and Isabella, in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries (Ibid. pp. 1-12; 2 pls.). BELGIUM AND HOLLAND Pictures from the School of Rembrandt.-R. R. TATLOCK publishes a paint- ing of Tobias Curing his Father's Blindness (owned by Mr. A. H. Buttery), which he attributes to an unknown artist of the school of Rembrandt in the middle of the seventeenth century. A second picture, Jacob and his Blood- stained Coat (National Gallery, Helsingfors), is clearly the work of another disciple of Rembrandt, Govaert Flinck, by whom it is signed. (Burl. Mag. XXXIX, 1921, pp. 195-196; 2 pls.) Painters of Mechlin.-M. J. FRIEDLINDER finds in a number of engravings a clue to the kind of work painters were doing in Mechlin in the early sixteenth century under the regency of Margaretha. Among the Mechlin painters of this period listed by van Mander, it is possible to identify Nicolas (given Hans m ,;,, "; ~~ .~??~ o FIGURE 7.--MADONNA BY PIN- TURIcCHIo: ROME.</page><page sequence="43">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1921 235 by van Mander), Hogenberg and Frans Crabbe as the authors of extant en- gravings, notably the series of The Entry of Charles V into Bologna by Hogen- berg. Hogenberg, who came from the south, was more independent than Crabbe; the latter was apparently not a little influenced by him as well as by others. (Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XLII, 1921, pp. 161-168; 5 figs.) A Self-Portrait by Rembrandt.-R. FRY describes the qualities in a portrait little known to the public, which is a late work by Rembrandt and one of his finest creations. (Burl. Mag. XXXVIII, 1921, pp. 262-263; pl.) The Barend Family.-J. HEWITT traces some of the main facts in regard to several generations of the Dutch painters, the Barend family. One member, Barent Dircksz, is identified as the painter of several pictures in Chichester cathedral, formerly thought to have been done by an Italian named Theo- doricus Barnardi. The work is to be dated in about 1519. (Burl. Mag. XXXVIII, 1921, pp. 263-264; fig.) A Painting by Vermeer.-R. R. TATLOCK publishes the little painting of the Girl with the Flute, recognized a few years ago as a work of Vermeer of Delft. (Burl. Mag. XXXIX, 1921, pp. 28-33; fig.) The "Hours" of James IV.-P. DURRIEU gives a r~sum6 of the characteris- tics of the school of miniature painters which, from the region in which it was active, he terms "'ganto-brugeoise,"' and he publishes a Book of Hours done by this school, which is identified by coats of arms and other insignia as that of James IV, king of Scotland, and his wife, Margaret of England. The manu- script is of special importance not only because of the excellent quality of the best of its miniatures, but because, being datable, between 1503 and 1513, it serves to date a group of similar manuscripts hitherto undatable.

W. FEWKES distinguishes between two types of prehistoric cliff-dwellings in the Southwest: (1) that which includes a circular and vaulted room called the kiva, used for ceremonial purposes, found in Colorado and northern Arizona; (2) that which shows no trace of the kiva, in southern Arizona and southern New Mexico. (Annual Report of the Smith- sonian Institution, 1919, pp. 421-426; 6 pls.) Iroquois Archaeology.-A. B. SKINNER has published an additional study of the characteristic Iroquoian remains in New York State. The monograph con- tains three papers: Archaeological Problems of the Northern Iroquois, Notes on Cayuga Archaeology, and Archaeological Researches in Jefferson County, N. Y. The author reiterates the conclusion that there are two culture levels in the region, an older, more uniform Algonkian level, and a later somewhat varied Iroquoian one. He thinks that Cayuga pottery is a development subsequent to the arrival of the Iroquois in their historic habitat (p. 87). Their ceramic art does not resemble that of the Cherokee and other southern Iroquoian</page><page sequence="44">236 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXVI, 1922 peoples. He summarizes the two cultures by contrast: "The material culture of the early Iroquois of New York was, roughly speaking, a culture of bone and of clay. . . . The Algonkian culture was one which developed the working of stone." [Notes on Iroquois Archaeology, New York, 1921, Museum of the American Indian. 216 pp.; 37 pls.; 52 figs.] The Lenap6.-M. R. HARRINGTON is the author of one of a much needed series of studies on the life of the Delaware or Lenap6 Indians formerly inhabit- ing New Jersey and Pennsylvania. These people removed from the east and are now to be found distributed in various parts of the west to the number of about 1900 in Oklahoma, Ontario and Kansas. Harrington treats the Lenap~ pan- theon, minor deities, beliefs of the soul, visions and guardian spirits and the great annual ceremony, and minor ceremonies. The ethnologist is struck with a conviction of the derivation of Lenap6 institutions from both the Iroquois and the southern culture areas. The use of masks, stone sculptures, purification rites, and dances are instances. The whole account of this little-known group is not so full but that we could wish for more.

New York, 1921, Museum of the American Indian. 249 pp.; 9 pls.; 19 figs.] The Sun Dance.-LESLIE SPIER has published two papers which furnish an ethnological survey and equation of the dominant feature of the religious life of the plains Indians. The Sun Dance is a ceremonial complex, its minor traits borrowed back and forth in the region under a systematic selection, the product of a long series of historical events.

PALACIAS on the Stone of the Sun in the Archaeological Museum in Mexico has been translated by F. STARR. It comprises a description of the stone, and an interpretation of its symbols, which express the prehistoric Mexican division of time, from minutes to cen- turies of 104 and cycles of 416 years. The author draws some inferences re- garding the chronology and history of the Indian races of Mexico. [The Stone of the Sun and the First Chapter of the History of Mexico.
