Collins, A Different Heaven and Earth (Valley Forge: Judson Press, 1974, 253 pages, $8.95) Rosemary Radford Ruether, New Woman New Earth: Sexist Ideologies and Human Liberation. (New York: Sea bury Press, 1975, 221 pages, $8.95) Scarcely a decade into "Anno Feminarum," the strands of feminist religious scholarship which were spun hesitantly at first and later in a whirl of energetic conferences and seminars are now being woven into books. Those schooled in the newly-coined language of consciousness-raising may want to respond with its familiar "yeah-yeah" to each book, affirming the courageous experience it embodies. With reluc tance will feminist reviewers shift to the "yes, but" of criticism. The "yeah-yeah" response to Sheila Collins' A Different Heaven and Earth is to the book as explicit "herstory" and to its suggestions for the existential rele vance of "Herstory." The central chap ters of this book look at the course of human events with attention to women's experience and feminine reli gious symbolism ("Herstory"); but its heart is the personal experience of the author during its writing as she de scribes it in the Foreword and ex presses it in non-discursive stories in cluded here and there in the book ("herstory"). Collins set out to report on the feminist theological movement only to find herself unable to continue the work without "doing theology" as well as reporting on it. As a report, A Different Heaven and Earth will help those who have missed the beginnings NOTES AND REVIEWS of feminist theology in conferences and papers, unpublished as well as pub lished. As theology, Collins' work is heavily dependent on the works of Mary Daly and Rosemary Ruether both for its analysis and its language; but she differs from these writers in actively seeking positive existential meaning through feminine imagery for God rather than in a direct move from "God the Father" to something like the non anthropomorphic "God the Verb." Collins' approach depends explicitly on Peter Berger's sociology of religion. Religion is seen as the most powerful legitimizing factor for the reality paradigm held by any particular human collectivity. Collins summarizes the simplified core of Christian beliefs and examines some of the cognitive principles which they presuppose. In each case she shows the relativity of the principle by juxtaposing it with alterna tive ways of formulating the raw data of experience which take into account the meaningfulness of "feminine" experi ences and symbols. With appropriate attention at each point to the way its characteristic principles re-enforced the subjugation of women, Collins draws out the reality-paradigm im bedded in rudimentary Christian belief as one which orders the raw data of experience in terms of linear time, a polarization of realities, and hierarchi cal-imperialistic order. Collins finds all the cognitive principles characteristic of Christianity to be religious legitima tions of patriarchal culture, the univer sal dominance of which is grounded in its willingness to use coercive power.
