Pritz Vehicle Research and Test Center East Liberty, OH ABSTRACT The current Hybrid III Thorax is capable of thoracic deflections up to a maximum of approximately 3 inches. A modified double rib design which allows deflections up to 3.5 inches is proposed and experimentally evaluated. In addition to this increased deflection capability, a Hybrid III thorax utilizing the double rib design exhibited reduced temperature sensitivity and increased durability. Thus the double rib design allows the Hybrid III to become a more repeatable, more durable anthropomorphic test device which may also assess more severe levels of thoracic injury. THE HYBRID III THORAX is capable of assessing thoracic injury, in part, through measurement of thoracic deflection. One of the objectives of the reported research has been to enhance the Hybrid III thorax to allow larger deflections which may be correlated to more severe thoracic injuries. As reported by Wiechel et al., (1) the current Hybrid III thorax has been designed so that contact between the sternum and spinal structure occurs at thoracic deflections of approximately 3 inches. This magnitude of deflection corresponds to a predicted thoracic injury level of AIS 3. In reference (1) it was suggested that injury levels of AIS 4 might be predicted if an additional 1/2 inch of thoracic deflection could be accommodated. The thoracic geometry must then permit at least a 3.5 inch deflection to make an AIS level 4 injury evaluation possible. A major problem to be considered when attempting to obtain thoracic deflections of 3.5 inches is the magnitude of stress produced in the ribs under these larger deflections. It has been demonstrated, through experimental means (1), that the current Hybrid III rib design exhibits plastic deformation in the steel at deflections of 3.5 Inches, thus establishing the need for a modified rib design. Tn developing a modified rib design for more severe injury assessment, consideration of the possible enhancement of other rib characteristics may be in order if such Improvements are attainable. One improvement of interest is a reduction in temperature sensitivity. Saul (3) experimentally evaluated the performance of the Hybrid III dummy using a linear transfer pendulum. He reported a 35% to 43% variation in measured thoracic deflection when the ambient temperature was allowed to vary from 65°F to 80°F. Thus close temperature control is necessary and special provisions must be made when the Hybrid III is to be used in outdoor test facilities. In addition to temperature sensitivity, under repeated Impacts from a linear transfer pendulum, the response of the Hybrid III thorax begins to show signs of degradation after approximately 15 to 20 impacts (1). This degradation is generally manifested as an Increase in peak deflection and a change in the overall shape of the force-deflection curve. In summary, the primary objective of this research has been to enhance the Hybrid III thorax so that a 3.5 inch deflection may be accommodated, enabling an AIS 4 thoracic injury level to be predicted. Additional objectives are to reduce the temperature sensitivity and Increase the endurance life of the Hybrid III ribs. Attainment of these objectives should result in a more repeatable, more durable test device that can assess more severe levels of thoracic injury. 3.1027 0096-736X/87/9503-1 027$02.50 Copyright 1987 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">PROPOSED RIB DESIGN MODIFICATION To address the three objectives just stated a computer rib model written by Bell (4) was utilized to develop a double rib design (1). This design resembled the standard Hybrid III rib structure with polyviscous damping material bonded to the surface of high carbon steel bands formed to simulate human ribs. However, its six individual ribs each consisted of an inner and outer member as shown in Figure 1 . The inner rib member was nested within the outer rib member. Limited experimental evaluation of the double rib design using a set of only two double ribs indicated that the modified rib design exhibited reduced temperature sensitivity, increased endurance, and an ability to deflect 3.5 inches without failure by excessive plastic deformation of the steel or cracking of the damping material.

Proposed double rib design. The research described in this paper extended and optimized the double rib design. Early experimental results (1) were carefully evaluated and an improved double rib design was formulated. A full thoracic structure of six double ribs was then constructed and experimentally evaluated. The performance of the double rib thorax was compared with the performance of the standard Hybrid III thorax. Wiechel (1) tested two design versions of the double ribs. In one design, the outer rib damping material thickness was 1/4 inch, and the inner rib had a damping material thickness of 1/8 inch. The second design was identical except that both inner and outer ribs had damping material thicknesses of 1/4 in. Experiments were performed by subjecting each of the design versions to a series of impacts utilizing a linear transfer pendulum. Following an analysis of the resulting experimental data a full set (six) of double ribs with inner and outer damping material thicknesses of 3/16 and 1/4 inch, respectively was constructed. This paper reports results from testing programs using full sets of the double ribs. Utilizing a linear transfer pendulum the full double rib thorax described above was subjected to a spectrum of approximately 90 impacts in which the temperature sensitivity, the endurance, and the behavior under deflections of 3.5 inches were investigated. Extensive comparisons were made with the standard Hybrid III ribs using experimental data generated by Saul (3). The results of the comparisons were encouraging, and a final iteration was made in an effort to determine the optimum thicknesses for the inner and outer rib damping material. Several criteria were considered in determining the optimum thickness of damping material for the inner and outer ribs. These include: (1) stresses in the damping material, (2) stresses in the steel, (3) temperature sensitivity, (4) hysteresis, and (5) force-deflection response of the structure. The balancing of the maximum stresses produced in the damping material was considered to assure that the stresses in the inner ribs do not vary significantly from those in the outer ribs. In addition, the balancing of the maximum stresses produced in the steel portions of the inner and outer ribs was considered. Although a balancing of stresses results in an efficient utilization of material, in a composite structure care must be taken to insure that balancing stresses in one element does not increase stresses in the other elements beyond acceptable levels. The steel utilized in the double rib design is identical to that in the standard Hybrid III ribs, both in thickness and in properties. Since the potential for plastic deformation at large thoracic deflections has been demonstrated (1), the balancing of steel stresses was considered a primary criterion. Four specific design versions were studied using the computer model. These are listed in Table 1. For case A the stresses produced in the steel were approximately the same for the inner and outer ribs. Case B describes the first full rib set evaluated experimentally. Case C was proposed as an improvement over Case B. Case D was an attempt to reduce the magnitude of the stress in the steel portions of the upper and lower ribs (ribs number 1 and 6 respectively) , since these ribs are the most highly stressed as determined both experimentally and analytically. For comparative purposes, the standard Hybrid III ribs were also evaluated using the computer model. The computer model allowed determination of the maximum stresses in both the steel and damping material for each of the six ribs. The stresses in the steel are important from the standpoint of preventing plastic deformation, 3.1028</page><page sequence="3">860655 Table 1. Proposed double rib design cases. Outer Rib Inner Rib Damping Damping Material Material Case Thickness Thickness A 0.325 in 0.05 in B 1/4 in 3/16 in C 1/4 in 1/8 in D rib 1 0 0 ribs 2-5 3/16 in 3/8 in rib 6 0 0 while the damping material stresses govern the endurance or fatigue life of the ribs. An evaluation of the results indicated that case C was the optimum choice. The computer model indicated a reduction of maximum stress in the damping material of 36% when compared to the standard Hybrid III rib. In addition» an 8% reduction in maximum steel stress was predicted. It should be noted that these specific percentage reductions refer to rib number 1, the most highly stressed. The computer model indicated that for case A, while the steel stresses were approximately equal for each rib» the damping material stresses were significantly increased» indicating that endurance life would probably be sacrificed. While case B had produced encouraging experimental results» it was observed that the experimental force-deflection response was too stiff when compared to the Neathery corridors. This observation led to case C which, having less damping material in its cross section, should exhibit a somewhat softer response. In addition, the reduction in the amount of damping material should contribute to a reduced temperature sensitivity, as the presence of vlscoelastlc damping material is the primary reason for a temperature dependent response. Case D was shown to also Increase the damping material stresses to an unacceptable level, thus excessively shortening the endurance life. The optimized double rib design is as shown in Figure 1, with damping material thicknesses of 1/8 inch and 1/4 inch for the inner and outer ribs, respectively. The following section of this paper describes the experimental evaluation and results for this proposed rib design. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF THE DOUBLE RIB DESIGN The double rib design was experimentally evaluated to determine response at deflections up to 3.5 inches, temperature sensitivity, and endurance. The experimental results were then compared to similar results generated using a Hybrid III dummy with standard ribs (3) • All testing was performed using a linear transfer pendulum. The testing program used to evaluate the double ribs is given in Table 2. Table 2. Double Rib Testing Program Ambient Pendulum Number of Temperature Velocity Impacts (°F) (fps) 72 14 3 72 22 8 72 14 3 80 14 3 72 14 4 endurance 65 14 3 evaluation 72 14 7 loading 72 20 3 block 72 22 3 72 14 1 72 22 1 72 28 3 80 22 3 65 22 3 72 22 3 The testing program consisted of 51 total impacts. The initial portion of the program, up to but not Including the Impacts at 28 fps, closely resembles a testing program performed using a Hybrid III dummy with standard ribs (3) . Repeating this same sequence of tests on the double ribs as shown in Table 2 allowed a comparison of response degradation due to the repeated impacts, giving a relative endurance evaluation. The testing program outlined in Table 2 also allowed a determination of temperature sensitivity and response evaluation at deflections of 3.5 inches. Comparative temperature sensitivity data for the standard ribs were taken from Saul (3). The thoracic impacts listed in Table 2 were performed in accordance with the appropriate specification from the General Motors Specification Package for the Hybrid III dummy (drawing number 79051-64). For the 72°F thoracic impacts at 14 and 22 fpç the double rib performance was checked to determine whether the resulting response fell within the performance specification corridors given by General Motors. Results are shown in Table 3. The only portion of the General Motors specification which was not considered valid in terms of the double rib design was the hysterisls ratio. It has been suggested that the loading portion of the thoracic force-deflection response is more critical with regard to biofidelity than the unloading portion (1). Therefore, when considering the double rib design it was decided that some hysteresis could be sacrificed at the expense of increased durability and decreased temperature sensitivity. Consequently, the hysteresis ratio requirement given by General Motors was relaxed and the minimum acceptable 3.1029</page><page sequence="4">Table 3.

As may be seen in Table 3, this was achieved. Figure 2 illustrates the Hybrid III thoracic force-deflection response to a pendulum impact velocity of 14 fps and an ambient temperature of 72°F. The responses for both the standard and double rib designs are given, as are the corresponding Neathery corridors. Clearly, neither rib design produces a response which fits well into the corridors. The standard rib design produces a somewhat stiffer response as indicated by the smaller displacement and slightly higher force. 1 600r 1200 - 1400- 1000 j- STANDARD RIBS - / j- DOUBLE RIBS Ö soo. / • I / ' 600 - TA'/ ) ~y/l / 200 -A 11 ' .// 0 ü/ i I i i I i i i i i I i 0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.4 3.0 3.6 4.2 DISPLACEMENT (IN) Figure 2.

It may be noted that the standard rib response more closely fits the Neathery corridors. However, the difference between the standard rib response and the double rib response is small. Also, at this impact velocity the standard rib design produces a somewhat softer response than the double rib structure, opposite to the relative behavior observed for an impact velocity of 14 1 600 1 1400" /-DOUBLE RIBS /-STANDARD RIBS 120°- / /k i ■ ' ' /7&lt;X j/ / ' £ 800- // / ' J ' O / / ' ' ^ 600 l' / i 600 // / // i / / / /7 // / 400 / / 200 - / y i i - J/ 0 I ¿J I I I I I I I 1 I I 0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.4 3.0 3.6 4.2 DISPLACEMENT (IN) Figure 3. Force-displacement response at 22 fps fps. This change in behavior with changes in impact velocity may be due to the velocity dependence exhibited by viscoelastic materials. Since the standard rib design contains more viscoelastic damping material than does the double rib design, its response might be expected to be more velocity dependent. The main impetus for developing the double rib design was to enhance the thoracic injury assessment capability of the Hybrid III dummy by providing for thoracic deflections of up to 3.5 inches without inducing a degradation of the force-deflection response. Figure 4 gives the double rib thoracic force-deflection response for a pendulum impact velocity of 28 fps. From this response curve it appears that the Hybrid III thorax can accommodate a deflection of 3.5 inches without internal mechanical interference such as rib/spine contact. In addition, no significant plastic deformation in the double ribs was detected, and three of these high velocity impacts produced no visible cracking in the viscoelastic damping material. Jt should be noted that the rubber stops normally located on the aluminum sternum were removed to facilitate the largest possible amount of displacement. The curves of Figure 5 show force-deflection responses of the double ribs for an impact velocity of 22 fps before and after the 3.5 inch deflections, indicating no significant degradation of the force-deflection response following the large rib deflections. An additional criterion in the development of the double rib design was a reduction in temperature sensitivity. Temperature sensitivity was defined by Saul (3) as the * change in peak thoracic deflection with temperature. Temperature sensitivity for the standard Hybrid III device was calculated as the 3.1030</page><page sequence="5">860655 2000 1750 - ^ 1 500 - ļ 1250 - / / m /' / / _i / ' / / ö 1000 - / / O / / I / LL / I 750 y y' 500 - y' 250 - / o i i i i i i i i i i i 1 0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.4 3.0 3.6 4.2 DISPLACEMENT (IN) Figure 4.

The temperature sensitivity data generated for the Hybrid III dummy with standard ribs (3) were used for comparison purposes in the research reported here. Results from the testing program outlined in Table 2 were used to calculate the temperature sensitivity of the double rib design using the method just described. Results for both the double ribs and standard ribs, as well as similar data for the Part 572 dummy are included in Table 4. Table 4. Temperature Sensitivity Results (Based on changes in deflection) Pendulum Velocity, fps Dummy and Rib Type 14 22 Part 572 9% Hybrid Ill/standard ribs 43% 35% Hybrid Ill/double ribs 18% 10% It may be noted that the double rib design is much less temperature sensitive than the standard Hybrid III ribs. Depending on the impact velocity of interest, the standard ribs exhibited a temperature sensitivity 2.4 to 3.5 times higher than the double rib design. The final enhancement criterion considered in the development of the double rib design was increased rib endurance life. Considering once again the testing program given in Table 2, the sequence of 39 impacts up to but not including the impacts at 28 fps closely resembles a sequence of similar tests performed by Saul on a Hybrid III device with standard ribs (3). Typically, after a number of impacts have been imposed on a given thorax the peak deflection begins to increase due to rib degradation. In order to quantify the endurance strength of a given rib set, the degradation will be defined here as the percent increase in peak deflection due to imposition of any specified loading block. Since the results for the particular 39 step loading block described above are known for both the standard and double rib designs, the percent increase in peak deflection developed between the first and last impacts within the specified loading block may be used to obtain a relative measure of degradation. The results are listed in Table 5. From Table 5 it may be seen that the specified sequence of 39 impacts of varying severity produced a degradation approximately six times higher in the standard rib thorax. Table 5. Degradation of Rib Response (Based on changes in deflection) Rib Design Degradation standard rib 14% double rib 2.3% Thus the endurance life of the double rib design represents a substantial improvement over the standard Hybrid III ribs.

Degradation of the double ribs SUMMARY Biofidelity of the loading portion of the thoracic force-deflection response has been maintained in a proposed double rib design enhancement of the Hybrid III thorax. The proposed double rib design allows larger thoracic deflections. With the double rib design incorporated in a Hybrid III thorax, a thoracic deflection of 3.5 inches may be accommodated without damage to the rib structure. The standard Hybrid III rib structure is susceptible to plastic deformation of the steel and damping material cracking at deflections less than this. Experimental evaluation of the proposed design indicated a hysteresis ratio of 54-56% as compared to the standard Hybrid III hysteresis ratio specification of 75-85%. However, it has been reported that this hysteresis loss is less critical than maintaining the biofidelity of the loading portion of the force-deflection response (1). In addition to increased thoracic injury assessment capability, use of the double rib design in a Hybrid III thorax reduces temperature sensitivity, slows degradation, and increases the useful life of the thoracic structure. For example, under linear pendulum impacts at 22 fps the temperature sensitivity was observed to decrease from 35% for the standard ribs to 10% for the double ribs. Also, for a given sequence of 39 impacts, the double rib design was observed to give a force-deflection response degradation which was less than that for the standard rib design by a factor of approximately six. This decrease in temperature sensitivity and increase in rib durability or endurance should allow the Hybrid III to become a more repeatable, more durable test device.
