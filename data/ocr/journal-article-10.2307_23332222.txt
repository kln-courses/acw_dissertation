From the Birth of Life to the Origin of Language, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999, 224 pp., illus., £ 18.99. Since the late 19th century, evolutionists have focused on evidence for the origin of new forms in a genealogical branching tree. One could follow gradual changes in the beak of the finch as Darwin did, or study the anatomy of apes and humans as Huxley and Haeckel did. Yet, there is another kind of evolutionary change, no less important. In the process of evolution, there is both divergence and integration; there is divergence in the production of new life forms, but there is integration when these unlike entities unite so as to make new wholes. These unions are recognized today to be at the basis of some of the major steps in the evolution of life on earth: the origin of cells, of organelles, of other symbiotic associations, of multicellular organisms, populations, and communities. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry's The Origins of Life is a concise and crisp account of how these kinds of major evolutionary transitions came about - from the origins of genes to language. It is driven essentially by two major themes: the division of labour, and the units of selection. Since the 19th century, the division of labour has been invoked to explain organic as well as human social progress. Developed in the socioeconomic theory of Adam Smith, the concept of division of labour was subsequently used by physiologist Henri Milne-Edwards to describe how the diverse organs of animals function for the good of the whole. Darwin then applied it to ecological relations between species when explaining divergence. Herbert Spencer, the most prominent 'social Darwinist', employed it to understand the entire world as a super-organism, exemplified by the reciprocal relations between plants 0308-7298/90 $ 3.00 © 1999 Taylor and Francis Ltd</page><page sequence="2">216 ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 and animals functioning for a common good. As long as there was competition, and natural relations between value and benefit, as it were, there would be an increasing integration of all members of human society or the ecological community into a mutually dependent and efficient higher social organism. The targets of selection for consideration are genes, organelles, cells, multicellular organisms, sexual populations, and communities. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry explain how selection acting between entities at one level can give rise to an integrated whole which in turn becomes a unit of selection - from independent molecular replicators to genes within cells, and cells within organisms. Or as they put it, their aim is to 'explain how complex entities evolved, despite selection between their components favouring selfish behaviour' (p. 20). The Origins of Life is a popular version of their acclaimed, The Major Transitions in Evolution. The evolutionary synthesis of the 1930s and 40s was based on the genetics of flies and mice, corn and barley. It dealt primarily with the past 600 million years, and held gene mutations and recombination to be the sources of evolutionary change. The evolution of complexity by association of once-independent entities has only recently come to the fore of evolutionary biology. The same is true for studies of the deep roots of the phylogenetic tree, archaebacteria, eubacteria, and the origins of the eukaryotic cell. Microbial phylogeny over the previous 3 billion years of evolution represents one of the most exciting aspects of contemporary evolutionary biology. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry have done a great service in providing an account of some of the major aspects of this research. But their story extends well beyond that to encompass the origin of language and aspects of human social organization. Indeed, their arguments reveal some of the deep roots of sociobiological thought. Because their story is about the evolution of information and its organization from DNA to language, it gives the strong impression of an evolutionary march from 'lower' to the 'higher' organisms. However, evolution is not anthropocentric. Those who work on the evolution and phylogeny of microorganisms emphasize that microorganisms account for most of the biomass on earth, well over 90% of the biodiversity, and they constitute the base on which all life rests (Olsen and Woese 1996; Whitman et al. 1998; Woese 1998). Molecular studies of microbial diversity indicate a rich, anarchic evolution. Only a few decades ago research on eukaryotic cell origins was dismissed as idle speculation, a relatively harmless activity like eating peanuts (Stanier 1970). Nucleotide sequencing technology has led to the contemporary revolution in the study of cell origins, and microbial</page><page sequence="3">ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 217 phylogeny. Though over-shadowed by the Human Genome Project, perhaps genome sequencing's greatest contribution is to evolutionary biology and microbial diversity; it is transforming them both in terms of scope and concepts. Investigations of early evolution have led to the recognition of the fundamental importance of gene transfers between species. Accordingly, the resulting evolutionary order may be non hierarchical (Doolittle 1999). In the Darwinian order of things, you sort plants and animals into species. Then you sort species resembling one another into genera, and label each species with a two-part Latinized name. Similar genera are grouped into families, families into orders, and so on up to phyla and finally, at the summit, the five kingdoms, plant, animals, fungi, protists, monerans. It's an ordering essentially like a military organization: individuals into squads, squads into platoons, platoons into companies, and so on. In classical Darwinism, phylogenetic order is due to common descent from an ever decreasing number of ancestors leading back to the origin of life, the common ancestor of all living things. Each species would be part of only one genus, and each genus part of one family and so on. But molecular evidence of intense horizontal gene transfer between taxa is undoing this conceptual order in regard to microbial phylogeny. Microbes are composites, chimeras; they have acquired and integrated genes from diverse taxa. Far from the branching hierarchical genealogical tree that Darwin and his followers imagined, the pattern of early evolution, (at least) is reticulated. Horizontal gene transfers among taxa make it resemble more a web than a tree (Margulis 1993; Pennisi 1999; Doolittle 1999). The anarchic nature of early evolution has led biologists to consider abandoning hopes of constructing a natural phylogenetic order, and instead focus on diversity and mechanisms underlying it. Generations of biologists and social theorists have shared central concepts and metaphors about organization and integration. Some early experimental biologists believed, in fact, that because biology dealt with organization as it was really more akin to the social sciences than to physics and chemistry (Sapp 1994). The division of labour is an example of a commonly employed principle. As it was at the end of the 19th century, so it is at the end of the 20th, wholes are to be understood in terms of an integrated system characterized by relations of interdependence and mutual benefit, with regulating checks and balances driven by competition between entities, whether genes, cells, organisms or species. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry deftly present these ideas dressed-up in their modern apparel. One will learn how an understanding of</page><page sequence="4">218 ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 organization and complexity in terms of the interactions of individuals conforms with genetic concepts about reproductive success, and about 'the ultimate replicator', the gene, which they hold to be the principle target of selection. But readers may do well to remember that alternative concepts about the organism have been offered for a hundred years. They are as pertinent now as then. Cell theory culminated with the theory of 'the cell state' or 'cell republic' championed by Schwann, Virchow, Haeckel, and their disciples. It is based on the concept of cells as individuals, and the principle of the division of labour. A simple colony of like-cells evolves into a commonwealth of differentiated and mutually dependent cells. Adopting mutual service as the best economy, individuals find themselves in the end so firmly bound together in interdependence that they constitute a complex individual. So, cells live a double life, one for themselves, and one for the organism in which they are parts. But not all biologists believed that cells made organisms. Protests against 'the organism as a beehive', and arguments about the inadequacy of the cell theory of development came from diverse quarters of biology. The development of an egg, it was argued, is not a matter of aggregation of millions of individuals functionally bound together by a division of labour and mutual interdependence. Development exhibited a structural unity. Cell division did not lead to organization; organization in the egg led to cell division. By the 1920s, holists added the concept of emergence - that in such a structured system, new properties emerge at higher levels of integration which could not have been predicted from knowledge of the parts. The formation of cells was of secondary significance to the organism as a whole. One could point to single-celled or acellular organisms which undergo elaborate differentiations without compartmentalization into cells. In short, organisms make cells, not the inverse. Similar debates have structured discussions about the origin and nature of cells themselves. That cells are built-up by swarms of 'elementary organisms' was a common conceptual paradigm of the late 19th century. The hypothetical units proposed by Darwin, Spencer, and Weismann were all endowed with the properties of life: assimilation, growth and reproduction. Even the symbiotic origin of the chromosomes, nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and centrioles had been suggested (Sapp 1994). That mitochondria and chloroplasts originated as bacterial symbionts is well supported today based on the comparative molecular morphology of their DNAs and that of the nuclear chromosomes (Margulis 1993). But mitochondria and chloroplasts are well-integrated in the cell as a whole, which makes them anew in each generation. No one today would argue that these cell organs</page><page sequence="5">ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 219 function as 'self-reproducing' individuals. Loss of individuality in at least one of the partners and morphogenetic changes accompany the evolution of symbiosis. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry take the term symbiosis to apply to the relations between genes as well. They therefore argue that symbiosis played a major part in two other major transformations: the origin of the first cells, and the origin of chromosomes. The aggregation of once independent molecular replicators within a membrane-bound structure led to the first cell. Selection acting on the whole resulted in a division of labour, and in cooperation among 'selfish genes'. The further placement of genes on chromosomes, they argue, was an evolutionary strategy designed by selection to prevent 'cheating' among 'selfish genes'. Thus, they speak of genes as symbionts living within their hosts. Here again we need to be wary, not just because it is difficult to imagine a host organism without genes, but because of the nature of genes. What is said above about the integration of cells and organelles also applies to molecules: the gene. Although Maynard Smith and Szathmâry view genes to be the 'ultimate replicators', we should remember that DNA by itself can actually do nothing. If there had been an 'RNA world' of once self replicating entities, genes have been well assimilated into the cell. Although geneticists and molecular biologists often speak carelessly of DNA as self-replicating, and like to think of genes making organisms, it makes more sense to speak of organisms making genes. It is certainly far from clear what Maynard Smith and Szathmâry (p. 36) mean when they refer to 'higher organisms' as 'bacteria and upwards'. Today, many biologists understand genes in terms of information, not as 'elementary organisms'. But to Maynard Smith and Szthamâry the gene remains an individual, the 'elementary organism' of old. We should also remember that although geneticists may view evolution in terms of gene frequencies, and that sociobiologists may view it in terms of 'selfish genes', naturalists insist that the individual organism is the main target of selection, not the gene (Mayr 1997). After all, they reason, a gene is never (or very infrequently) directly exposed to selection, but only in the context of its entire genotype, and since the gene may have different selective values in different genomic contexts, it is highly unsuitable as the target of selection. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry ignore such arguments in their unwavering emphasis on the importance of a gene's eye view: how the struggle for reproductive success among genes can account for the organization of once-independent entities into 'higher forms'. The gene, considered as an individual within another, is the basis of their views about the genetic conditions for cooperation. They argue that because of</page><page sequence="6">220 ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 the common 'interests' of genes bound within a cell, one should expect such cooperation for a common good - the good of the genes - to occur between closely related organisms. For them, the evolution of multicellular organisms illustrates the genetic conditions for cooperation. The cells of those complexes have virtually identical genomes. What does this gene-centred view predict about the intimate symbioses between different taxa? Two things. Such symbioses would rarely, if ever, be of mutual benefit (p. 22), and the inheritance of acquired microbial symbionts would be an unusual occurrence (pp. 105, 107). Both kinds of phenomena would be 'exceptions' to 'the gene rules'. Let's examine their account of them. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry's discussion of some of the classic cases of symbiosis, nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the root nodules of legumes, associations between plant roots and fungus (Mycorrhiza), algae living inside the flatworm Convoluta, bacteria in aphids, is similar to discussions witnessed over the past century. Although the term, symbiosis is sometimes taken to mean mutualism, it embraces a continuum of relationships - ranging from parasitism, to commensalism as well as mutualism. Over the past century, a host of anthropomorphic metaphors - slavery, consortium, the relations between men and women, among nations, and the relations between humans and domesticated plants - have been used by biologists to describe and understand symbiosis (Sapp 1994). Symbiosis researchers have long cautioned that the double danger of research into this type of phenomenon lies in using ideas that border on an illusory anthropomorphism, and on trying to reduce complex associations to simple elementary relations. The other problem with using terms for human social relations to explain nature is that, intentionally or not, they seem to come full circle and thus naturalize human socio-political relations. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry think that slavery is the best way to understand the relations of algae and fungi in the lichen association - an issue discussed ever since it was first proposed by Simon Schwendener in 1868. The authors insist that other symbiotic associations also need to be looked at carefully with the question of slavery in mind (p. 24). Though many cases of symbiosis involve complementarity in physiological functions, cost-benefit analysis between associates has not been easy to do. In many cases, the benefit of the 'host' appears obvious, but the benefit to the microbe is only assumed and is often difficult to investigate. Microbial symbionts may be supportive by carrying out biochemical processes impossible to the host; they can photosynthesize, fix nitrogen, metabolize sulphur, digest cellulose, or synthesize amino acids. The great irony is that microbes, so-called</page><page sequence="7">ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 221 'lower life' were seldom regarded for so long as anything but parasites, pathogenic germs. Microbial symbiosis has been of enormous importance in the evolution of life on earth: Mycorrhiza associations are present in over 80% of all known flowering plants. There is evidence that this symbiosis has existed since the Devonian period, when the land was first colonized by plants. Since the soil was mineral in composition, the fungus would have been crucial in bringing minerals to plants. Symbiosis is at the foundation of important ecosystems such as deep sea vents, and the most biodiverse communities on earth: rainforests and coral reefs. The natural history and evolution of microbes, the basis of all life on earth has remained outside of biology for so long not just because of technical limitations. Symbiosis and a microbe's-eye view of evolutionary change developed in constant tension with host-centred biology (Sapp 1994). Medical and veterinarian interests have distorted our view of microbes, and conceptual assumptions about heredity and evolution left little room for the role of symbiosis in evolution. The inheritance of acquired bacteria transmitted through the egg lay beyond the conceptual and methodological framework of classical genetics, and of the evolutionary synthesis which followed from it. Such phenomena have either been excluded from genetic and evolutionary consideration or treated as exceptions, curiosities. Maynard Smith and Szathmàry's arguments are illustrative. In their paradigm, 'cooperation' is characteristic of genetically related organisms, and even then it will not evolve unless it 'pays': the cooperating individuals must do better than they would if each acted on its own. But to understand the evolution of chloroplasts and mitochondria, they add a third principle which they call: 'central control'. In the course of evolution, most of the genes once present in mitochondria and chloroplasts have been transferred to the cell nucleus. So they argue that this biological system is analogous to human societies in which 'co-operation is often enforced by some form of central authority'. They liken the transfer of genes to the nucleus, to paying taxes: 'Most Englishmen and Hungarians pay taxes because they are punished if they do not' ( p. 23). Maynard Smith and Szathmàry's anthropomorphisms in regard to intracellular dynamics are egregious examples of the problems of viewing human social forms and technology in terms of natural evolution (or the inverse). It is striking how many different and conflicting metaphors they apply to genes in just a few pages. In their text, genes are represented as replicators, as selfish symbionts, as information like a computer programme, as analogous to language, and as money to pay taxes. That is indeed a taxing load of mixed metaphors for the progress of reason.</page><page sequence="8">222 ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 Moreover, in recent years the biological basis for their interpretations of eukaryotic cell evolution has been unearthed. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry (p. 60) suspect that the nucleus 'evolved without [bacterial] symbiosis'. Although this was a common assumption of the serial endosymbiosis theory of the 1970s and 80s, compartive molecular studies indicate that the nucleus itself is a chimera of two kinds of bacteria: eubacteria and archaebacteria. Microbial phylogeneticists now suggest that the nucleus did indeed emerge from a symbiosis between two distinct kinds of bacteria (Gupta 1998). What's more, the ancestor of mitochondria, far from being a 'slave', may have been one of the partners of that symbiogenetic event which led to the nucleus (Martin and Miller 1998; Gray, Burger and Lang 1999). Microbial symbiosis and lateral gene transfer between taxa are well recognized to have played crucial roles in the early evolution of life on earth. But what about more recently in evolutionary times? Has the inheritance of acquired micro-organisms played a major role in the evolution of plants and animals? Empirical evidence is still sketchy, but evolutionists' opinions have been based on theoretical assumptions about the prevalence of mutualistic forms of symbiosis and about reproductive success. It is generally understood today that the inheritance of microbes results in selection pressure away from parasitism toward mutualism or commensalism. This is expected because when the primary mode of transmission of a microbe is through the reproduction of the host, then harming the host will reduce transmission of the microbe, whereas a benign or beneficial effect will enhance transmission. Historically, the notion that any individual may be a super-organism comprised of cooperating organisms, and possess genomes from diverse taxa has been extraordinarily difficult to accept. To Maynard Smith and Szathmâry, they are exceptional occurrences, limited largely to early microbial evolution, and a rare phenomenon in plants and animals. As they observe, 'transmission of symbionts in the host eggs is unusual' (p. 107). This will not do. Symbiosis researchers have long argued that the relative sparsity of cases of the inheritance of acquired microbes may not be a reflection of its occurrence in nature, but only the extent to which such cases were sought out and investigated. They were right. One need only mention here recent research on the bacteria of the genus Wolbachia. These bacteria are maternally inherited through the cytoplasm of their hosts. Surveys based on molecular phylogenetic techniques for screening have, so far, found these bacteria in more than 16% of all known insect species, including each of the major insect orders. Their distribution in arthropods and other phyla are yet to be determined (Werren 1997).</page><page sequence="9">ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 223 Wolbachia cause a number of reproductive alterations in their hosts, including cytoplasmic incompatibility between strains and related species, parthenogenesis induction and femininization: they can convert genetic males into reproductive females (and produce intersexes). They are far from 'slaves'. If the importance of between-gene selection is debatable, selection between microbe and host is certainly not. An evolutionary perspective, especially from a microbe's eye view, also holds great promise for improving the etiology, prevention and treatment of diseases (Ewald 1994). Wolbachia appear to have evolved as specialists in manipulating reproduction and development of their hosts. It's a pity that Maynard Smith and Szathmâry have not considered these bacteria because they have great implications for important evolutionary processes, especially as a mechanism for rapid speciation. They also present a challenge to standard sociobiological interpretations of insect societies about which only 'interests' of nuclear genes are accounted for (Wenseelers et al. 1998). Maynard Smith and Szathmâry's account reveals several other aspects of the limitations of a gene's, eye view of biology and its assumptions from the standpoint of actual experimental evidence, some old and some new. The authors repeatedly assert that genes specify the three-dimensional structure of proteins by specifying their amino acid sequence. Yet, this assumption has been qualified by contemporary molecular studies. It seems that most large proteins in eukaryotes will not fold 'properly' if not guided by a member of a family of proteins called 'chaperonins' (Burston and A.R. Clarke 1995). It is going too far then to say that the shape and function of a protein are fully determined by the primary amino-acid sequence, and this in turn by the nucleotide sequence of a gene. Chaperone proteins are not the only proteins recently recognized to have hereditary information. Prions must also be considered. Over the past 17 years, Stanley Prusiner and his colleagues have provided convincing evidence and arguments that they are pure protein; and prions perpetuate themselves by mechanisms independent of the information in DNA. The 'protein-only' prion theory entails a radical alteration in concepts of disease and contagion; it also exacts important changes in our concepts of heredity, development and evolution. There is evidence of prions which play a normal part in development, and which can arise de novo, induced under certain environmental conditions (Masison, Maddelein, Wickler 1997; Westaway, Telling, Priola 1997; Wickler et al. 1999). A prion-like model has also been proposed for centriolar reproduction. The reproduction (and function) of centrioles has been a biological enigma for a century (Sapp 1999). In some organisms they</page><page sequence="10">224 ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 seem to be formed de novo\ in others, they seem to exhibit genetic continuity. There is no evidence of centriolar DNA, but recently, it has been postulated that a submicroscopic centriole-remnant may act as a progenitor (Mignot 1996). As the problem of morphogenesis begins to re-emerge today, some cell biologists have protested against the notion of a genetic programme or DNA blueprint capable of making a cell or organism, or something analogous to a 'Jurassic Park' (Albrecht-Buehler 1990; Harold 1995; Sapp 1998). Embryologists throughout the century have lamented that the success of the gene theory is a hindrance to the study of how the molecular constituents come together in space and time. Cell biologists concerned with the problem of morphogenesis have emphasized the importance of the spatial organization of the cell, and of morphogenetic fields operating in the organism as a whole and within cells themselves. They also have revitalized the notion that only a cell can make a cell. Indeed, there are classical experiments showing that a structural modification can pass from one generation to the next in the absence of genetic (that is genie) alteration. They have been known about for decades (Nanney 1980; Frankel 1989). In grafting experiments with Paramecium in the 1960s, Tracey Sonneborn and Janine Beisson inverted a small patch of cortical organization containing rows of cilia. The progeny inherited the inverted patch which bred true to type through both sexual and asexual reproduction, free from genie intervention. Subsequent work on Paramecium and Tetrahymena produced many additional examples of such structural inheritance. As Joseph Frankel has argued, there are at least two kinds of mechanisms operating to maintain cell structure (Frankel 1989). One is a local form of structural guidance involving microscopically visible cell structure; the second is a global pattern which exhibits properties which embryologists traditionally associated with morphogenetic fields. Several biologists have interpreted cortical inheritance as experimental proof of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (Lwoff 1990; Landman 1991). When explaining why he himself is a Weismannian, an eminent neo-Darwinist warned his colleagues: There are a few well established exceptions, of which the phenomenon of 'cortical inheritance' in ciliates is perhaps the most important. Neo-Darwinists should not be allowed to forget these cases because they constitute the only significant threat to our views (Maynard Smith 1983). Perhaps, when it comes to advice, giving is easier than taking, especially when it threatens deep-seated myths about heredity and evolution. Perhaps, like hereditary symbiosis, non-DNA based inheritance, such as 'cortical inheritance' are not 'exceptions' at all. Information in genes alone can no more make cells than individuals</page><page sequence="11">ESSAY REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 21 (1999), 215-226 225 alone can perpetuate culture. Structural inheritance is somewhat analogous to cultural information. These 'exceptional' facets of cell heredity and morphogenesis (like symbiogenesis) point to seminal problems for biology in the next century. Maynard Smith and Szathmâry wish to extend their gene-centred view to account for aspects of human social history. They present an evolutionary explanation for the importance of myth, religion and xenophobia in the formation of cultures, and they believe that human instinct causes wars (pp. 145-148). I share their sentiment about the need for myths that extend loyalty to all humans collectively (and to biodiversity). But the myth is more than our genes.
