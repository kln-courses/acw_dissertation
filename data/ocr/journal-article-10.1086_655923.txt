Both highlight the office tower block and similarly Photorealism’s definite investment in notions of craft and the artisanal production of  iconic sites of the burgeoning service industry (shops, diners, entertainment centres) as images, on the one hand, and its move to chronicle precisely those early years of post- the primary exemplars of the profound transformation wrought upon the world of work manual, post-craft, post-industrial, post-Fordist post-production on the other. Already  in the mid-1960s to mid-70s — and the ‘world of work’ truly is the crucial phrase here.7 then, Photorealism must have struck many a viewer as deliberately nostalgic indeed —   Whenever I walk past the imposing row of identikit office tower blocks lining the works’ elegiac tone easily recast as an expression of its perceived reactionary agenda:  Midtown Manhattan’s Sixth Avenue, I think not only of the hilarious 1980 comedy here was a picture of a world (of sound American family values, among other things)  Nine to Five, starring Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin as three working destined to go up in smoke. But its emergence as a movement was also, indisputably,  women plotting to overthrow their insufferably sexist boss, but somewhere further along timely: it painted an accurate portrait (if not outright reflection) of the very processes  this stream of associations I also imagine none other than Richard Estes sitting down through which this world was evaporating. in the same diner where the Nine to Five women take their lunch, eavesdropping on  their conspiratorial exchanges and preparing to commit this quintessential City of  Glass scene to painterly memory. In this sense, Photorealism, as an art form enchanted  with the endless proliferation of shiny surfaces that render all questions of both origin  and substance oddly irrelevant, could be said to function as North America’s very own  brand of 1970s Socialist Realism: it obliquely reflects (no pun intended!) both the central  economic event of the era — the triumph, incarnated by the glass-sheet office tower,  of the service (and culture) industries over more traditional, ageing industries from the  secondary sector (such as steel and coal), whose Spartan work ethic and macho machine- aesthetic still informed, in a melancholy kind of way, the Minimalism of Donald Judd  and Carl Andre8 — as well as, more literally, the actual conditions of labour (i.e. glass- encased office work) in this new regime of consumption rather than production.  Just like the original orthodoxy of Soviet Socialist Realism, Photorealism primarily  commented upon the world of work, albeit a very different world of work (there is  relatively little real domesticity or privacy in much Photorealist output, Robert Bechtle’s  family portraits notwithstanding — the movement’s most persistent obsession was always the urban experience). In fact, it often seemed to depict work more directly  than some of the explicitly politicised art of the time (the Maoist paintings of Jörg  Immendorff come to mind, as do the writings of Art &amp; Language), whose occasionally  perfunctory rhetoric of labour activism and solidarity with the workers may now — enter  the saddening ironies of historical circumstance — strike many as hollow. Of course the  laborious production of a Photorealist tableau itself was definitely ‘work’ in a way that  actively challenged the doxa of de-skilling then current in post-Duchampian avant-garde  art. Responding to a question of whether there exists such a thing as a Photorealist work  ethic, Louis K. Meisel, the gallerist who was the movement’s most influential impresario,  proudly remarked that ‘Photorealists had to work eight or ten hours a day. [Truly ‘nine  to five’ then. — DR] They didn’t drink, didn’t smoke or do drugs. They were among the  most stable people of any that I’ve ever seen, just making work that required stability  and seriousness. That may have made them boring to people who expect artists to be  troubled and dissolute.’9 Disregarding for a minute the important fact that the laborious  production of said tableaux made for rare and highly valued commodities (among  art collectors who cared for such a thing and weren’t phased by the critical dismissal  7 I borrow this term from Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello’s The New Spirit of Capitalism (trans. Gregory    Elliott), London and New York: Verso, 2005, which offers a riveting account of capitalism’s ruthless    recuperation and appropriation of the many ‘artistic’ critiques levelled against it from the mid-1960s    onwards — a campaign that was largely driven by the many practices connected with the Conceptual    art boom.  8 The one artist whose work most exemplarily bridges the gap between Minimalism’s nostalgic    attachment to the golden age of industry (as represented by the steel mills of both Gary, Indiana   and Magnitogorsk in Siberia) and the new regime’s emphasis on immaterial labour and corporate    governance — of a type that rhetorically adheres to transparency (glass) but in actuality sticks   to opacity (mirrors) — is Dan Graham. Graham’s glass pavilions directly reference the various  Don Eddy, Silver Shoes, 3. THE VANISHING  architectural transformations required to accommodate these new conditions of labour (Graham’s    Homes for America from 1967 had already highlighted the serendipitous concurrence of Minimalism’s  1974, acrylic on canvas,   sculptural vernacular with conveyor-belt-type domestic architecture).

Collection figure so prominently in Fredric Jameson’s passionate critique of our postmodern  of the Bank of Spain, simulacracy.15 An exhibition I saw of the work of Thomas Demand in Berlin just  Madrid recently also reminded me of the fact that our deeply seated suspicion (if not outright  hostility) towards hyperrealisms of all kinds is ultimately rooted in the low esteem that  such fancies as the technique of trompe-l’œil painting have been held in historically —  a residual trace of the original Platonic indictment of all mimesis, perhaps.17   What ultimately matters most in any current consideration of Photorealism  (or of the currency of Photorealism as such), however, is its relation to the tradition of  realism more generally: perhaps the ‘problem’ of Photorealism is not so much situated  in its retrograde dependence upon the largely discredited truth-claims of photography,  but in its realist pedigree instead — and for much of the past century, pictorial realism  has mainly been the object of scorn and condescension, or of pity at best. Indeed, aside  from their fascination with the decidedly unsexy topic of work (and, just as importantly,  the classes who perform this work), is it not simply their unflinching attachment to  an unashamedly ‘realist’ agenda, as much as their industrial-like production that has  ensured the systematic art-historical marginalisation of both Socialist Realism and  Photorealism, as evinced by so many authoritative histories of twentieth-century art?18  Some have been rescued since, so there may be hope for the critical plight of the Photore- alists; their contribution to the intellectual history of realism, which I have attempted to  locate in the historical relationship of their work to the transformation of the workplace,  will turn up at the forefront of this eventual reappraisal.  In the meantime, a new, post-Photorealist realism may well be readying itself to  dominate the art scene in the decade to come — for crises truly breed realisms, and ‘crisis’  has been the unofficial name of our time for a little while now. Realism proper (that of  the original nineteenth-century variety); Socialist Realism; Walker Evans’s, Dorothea  Lange’s and Diego Rivera’s realism; Capitalist Realism; Critical Realism; and, most  topically, Photorealism: they all belong to defining moments of economic, political,  social and cultural crisis — the last, as we have seen, to a crisis that concerned the  world of work in particular, resulting, precisely, in depictions and descriptions of its  gradual dismantling. The fact that the glory years of Photorealism were also marked  by an economic downturn (hence its sensitivity to issues surrounding labour, and its  nostalgia-laden espousal of a good old-fashioned work ethic) is not without importance  when considering this particular realism’s afterlife in the current era — one sorely in  need of financial realism, and of a return to (rather than of) the real as in ‘real work’.  16 That is to say, it is hard not to look at Alan Michael’s painting of shoes without thinking back to the    When I saw Courbet’s work assembled in two massive retrospective exhibitions  debate sparked by Jameson’s reading of Warhol’s shoes: Jameson famously discusses Warhol’s well-  publicised shoe fetish in relation to an early icon of artistic modernity, Vincent Van Gogh’s Paar   held in Paris and New York two years ago, the greatest surprise came in the guise of  Bauernschuhe (Pair of Boots, 1883).

Both highlight the office tower block and similarly Photorealism’s definite investment in notions of craft and the artisanal production of  iconic sites of the burgeoning service industry (shops, diners, entertainment centres) as images, on the one hand, and its move to chronicle precisely those early years of post- the primary exemplars of the profound transformation wrought upon the world of work manual, post-craft, post-industrial, post-Fordist post-production on the other. Already  in the mid-1960s to mid-70s — and the ‘world of work’ truly is the crucial phrase here.7 then, Photorealism must have struck many a viewer as deliberately nostalgic indeed —   Whenever I walk past the imposing row of identikit office tower blocks lining the works’ elegiac tone easily recast as an expression of its perceived reactionary agenda:  Midtown Manhattan’s Sixth Avenue, I think not only of the hilarious 1980 comedy here was a picture of a world (of sound American family values, among other things)  Nine to Five, starring Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin as three working destined to go up in smoke.

In this sense, Photorealism, as an art form enchanted  with the endless proliferation of shiny surfaces that render all questions of both origin  and substance oddly irrelevant, could be said to function as North America’s very own  brand of 1970s Socialist Realism: it obliquely reflects (no pun intended!) both the central  economic event of the era — the triumph, incarnated by the glass-sheet office tower,  of the service (and culture) industries over more traditional, ageing industries from the  secondary sector (such as steel and coal), whose Spartan work ethic and macho machine- aesthetic still informed, in a melancholy kind of way, the Minimalism of Donald Judd  and Carl Andre8 — as well as, more literally, the actual conditions of labour (i.e. glass- encased office work) in this new regime of consumption rather than production.  Just like the original orthodoxy of Soviet Socialist Realism, Photorealism primarily  commented upon the world of work, albeit a very different world of work (there is  relatively little real domesticity or privacy in much Photorealist output, Robert Bechtle’s  family portraits notwithstanding — the movement’s most persistent obsession was always the urban experience). In fact, it often seemed to depict work more directly  than some of the explicitly politicised art of the time (the Maoist paintings of Jörg  Immendorff come to mind, as do the writings of Art &amp; Language), whose occasionally  perfunctory rhetoric of labour activism and solidarity with the workers may now — enter  the saddening ironies of historical circumstance — strike many as hollow. Of course the  laborious production of a Photorealist tableau itself was definitely ‘work’ in a way that  actively challenged the doxa of de-skilling then current in post-Duchampian avant-garde  art. Responding to a question of whether there exists such a thing as a Photorealist work  ethic, Louis K. Meisel, the gallerist who was the movement’s most influential impresario,  proudly remarked that ‘Photorealists had to work eight or ten hours a day. [Truly ‘nine  to five’ then. — DR] They didn’t drink, didn’t smoke or do drugs. They were among the  most stable people of any that I’ve ever seen, just making work that required stability  and seriousness. That may have made them boring to people who expect artists to be  troubled and dissolute.’9 Disregarding for a minute the important fact that the laborious  production of said tableaux made for rare and highly valued commodities (among  art collectors who cared for such a thing and weren’t phased by the critical dismissal  7 I borrow this term from Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello’s The New Spirit of Capitalism (trans. Gregory    Elliott), London and New York: Verso, 2005, which offers a riveting account of capitalism’s ruthless    recuperation and appropriation of the many ‘artistic’ critiques levelled against it from the mid-1960s    onwards — a campaign that was largely driven by the many practices connected with the Conceptual    art boom.  8 The one artist whose work most exemplarily bridges the gap between Minimalism’s nostalgic    attachment to the golden age of industry (as represented by the steel mills of both Gary, Indiana   and Magnitogorsk in Siberia) and the new regime’s emphasis on immaterial labour and corporate    governance — of a type that rhetorically adheres to transparency (glass) but in actuality sticks   to opacity (mirrors) — is Dan Graham.

   <page sequence="12"> Pere Borrell del Caso, work of Alan Michael, who has painted both the shiny, undulating body of a Mini  Escapando de la critica Cooper (Cars and Houses, 2008) and the harsh gleam of freshly polished shoes (Untitled  (Escaping Criticism), (Shoes), 2005): it is hard not to look at the latter without thinking back to Andy Warhol’s  1874, oil on canvas, Diamond Dust Shoes (1980—81)series, which, along with the Wells Fargo Center,  66 x 63cm. Collection figure so prominently in Fredric Jameson’s passionate critique of our postmodern  of the Bank of Spain, simulacracy.15 An exhibition I saw of the work of Thomas Demand in Berlin just  Madrid recently also reminded me of the fact that our deeply seated suspicion (if not outright  hostility) towards hyperrealisms of all kinds is ultimately rooted in the low esteem that  such fancies as the technique of trompe-l’œil painting have been held in historically —  a residual trace of the original Platonic indictment of all mimesis, perhaps.17   What ultimately matters most in any current consideration of Photorealism  (or of the currency of Photorealism as such), however, is its relation to the tradition of  realism more generally: perhaps the ‘problem’ of Photorealism is not so much situated  in its retrograde dependence upon the largely discredited truth-claims of photography,  but in its realist pedigree instead — and for much of the past century, pictorial realism  has mainly been the object of scorn and condescension, or of pity at best. Indeed, aside  from their fascination with the decidedly unsexy topic of work (and, just as importantly,  the classes who perform this work), is it not simply their unflinching attachment to  an unashamedly ‘realist’ agenda, as much as their industrial-like production that has  ensured the systematic art-historical marginalisation of both Socialist Realism and  Photorealism, as evinced by so many authoritative histories of twentieth-century art?18  Some have been rescued since, so there may be hope for the critical plight of the Photore- alists; their contribution to the intellectual history of realism, which I have attempted to  locate in the historical relationship of their work to the transformation of the workplace,  will turn up at the forefront of this eventual reappraisal.  In the meantime, a new, post-Photorealist realism may well be readying itself to  dominate the art scene in the decade to come — for crises truly breed realisms, and ‘crisis’  has been the unofficial name of our time for a little while now. Realism proper (that of  the original nineteenth-century variety); Socialist Realism; Walker Evans’s, Dorothea  Lange’s and Diego Rivera’s realism; Capitalist Realism; Critical Realism; and, most  topically, Photorealism: they all belong to defining moments of economic, political,  social and cultural crisis — the last, as we have seen, to a crisis that concerned the  world of work in particular, resulting, precisely, in depictions and descriptions of its  gradual dismantling. The fact that the glory years of Photorealism were also marked  by an economic downturn (hence its sensitivity to issues surrounding labour, and its  nostalgia-laden espousal of a good old-fashioned work ethic) is not without importance  when considering this particular realism’s afterlife in the current era — one sorely in  need of financial realism, and of a return to (rather than of) the real as in ‘real work’.  16 That is to say, it is hard not to look at Alan Michael’s painting of shoes without thinking back to the    When I saw Courbet’s work assembled in two massive retrospective exhibitions  debate sparked by Jameson’s reading of Warhol’s shoes: Jameson famously discusses Warhol’s well-  publicised shoe fetish in relation to an early icon of artistic modernity, Vincent Van Gogh’s Paar   held in Paris and New York two years ago, the greatest surprise came in the guise of  Bauernschuhe (Pair of Boots, 1883). In the former, he identifies ‘the emergence of a new kind of flatness   the artist’s late still-lifes, which I had never really paid much attention to: magnificent  or depthlessness, a new kind of superficiality in the most literal sense, perhaps the supreme formal   feature of all postmodernisms. [...] Then we must certainly come to terms with the role of photography   stacks of apples, painted while he was imprisoned, late in life, for his role in toppling the  and the photographic negative in contemporary art of this kind; and it is this, indeed, which confers   Napoleonic column on the Place Vendôme during the heady days of the Paris Commune,  its deathly quality to the Warhol image.’ F. Jameson, Postmodernism, op. cit., p.9. It is interesting to   contrast Warhol’s morbid glaze with the heroic depiction of death in Courbet’s paintings of trout. and three mid-size paintings of gleaming trout. As Laurence Des Cars put it in the 17 Thomas Demand, ‘Nationalgalerie’, September 2009—January 2010, Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin.  accompanying catalogue, ‘these canvases, which belong among the most poignant  The ‘problem’ (if we want to call it that) of Demand’s work and working method is best explained by   referring to the monumental installation Grotto, which was exhibited by the Fondazione Prada at the   experiences of the real formulated by Courbet, allow painting itself its full metaphorical  2007 Venice Biennale — the first time, in fact, that Demand allowed the viewer to peek behind the   power’.16 Could this metaphorical power not be located precisely in the dark gloss of  scenes of his production process. In this exhibition, the visitor could not only admire Demand’s large-  scale photograph of a gloomy, cavernous interior, but could also lay eyes upon the actual model that was   the meticulously applied varnish that envelops Courbet’s trout, caught as they are in  built for the occasion over a period of two years. The press release proudly revealed that no less than   the agony of their last gasps for air — life’s very own tantalising gleam?  900,000 different layers of cardboard had gone into the production of the 36-ton object, which thereby   alone became the centrepiece of the exhibition. Here, Photorealism again crossed paths with the    heroism of work — simple awe at the endless hours of monastic labour that, without a doubt, must have   5.

One could argue that both Socialist Realism and Photorealism have also been    the victims of systematic art-historical marginalisation because much of the work produced according   What about Photorealism today?
