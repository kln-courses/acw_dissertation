<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANT ON JUDAISM * By SIDNEY AXINN, Temple University IMMANUEL KANT HAS ALWAYS HAD a special fascination for Jewish philosophers. In addition to the interest in his work from philosophical motives, there has regularly arisen the question, How close is Kant to Judaism? An important recent addition to the literature on this question was "Kant and Judaism," by Professor Emil Fackenheim, in Commentary, December, I963. In the present paper I will examine the specific criticisms that Kant himself made of Judaism, and then turn to considering certain themes that Professor Fackenheim raised in his article. Kant's view of religion is presented most directly in his book, Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone.' He develops what he calls "the pure religion of reason," and explains the connections between this position and the historical religions. He holds that there is really but one religion, and various faiths. In one passage he argued that, in its original form, Judaism was really not a religion at all, but merely a political entity. 2 Three points were offered by way of "proof" * I am happy to acknowledge that the work on this subject was assisted by a research grant by the Board of Trustees of Temple University. 1 Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft was pub- lished in I793 in K6nigsberg, and a second edition appeared the following year. The first section of the book, Uber das radikale Bose in der menschlichen Natur, had been published as an article in the Berlinische Monatsschliift in April, I792. With the exception of note # 7, the reference I will cite for Kant's work is IMMANUEL KANT: SCHRIFTEN ZUR ETHIK UND RELIGIONSPHILOSOPHIE, published as Volume IV of the complete edition of Kant by Insel-Verlag, Wies- baden, I956.

First, its commands relate merely to external acts and lay no requirements "upon the moral disposition." The commands are directed to nothing but outer observance, he holds. However, he also makes the point in passing that "the Ten Commandments are, to the eye of reason, valid as ethical commands even had they not been given publicly." Second, that Judaism limits reward and punishment to this world. Third, the concept of a chosen people. He remarks that this last showed enmity toward all other peoples, and therefore evoked the enmity of all. In several places in his book on religion, Kant adds to these criticisms his view that Abraham's decision to prepare to slaughter his son at the apparent command of God was an immoral decision. Each of these charges deserves to be examined. Was Judaism essentially political rather than religious? Kant adds that he does not doubt that the Jews, "each for himself, have framed some sort of religious faith which was mingled with the articles of their statutory belief." He takes this religious faith to be outside of "the legislation of Judaism.' At this point one may wonder about Kant's acquaintance with Judaism and with Jews. Presumably he takes the Old Tes- tament to be the essential document defining Judaism. His acquaintance with individual Jews included contact with Moses Mendelssohn and Solomon lMaimon, about both of whom he made complimentary remarks. Returning to his charge, one must agree that Kant is right about a certain part of the political origin and orientation of Judaism. Moses performed a political feat when he freed the slaves from verfassung gegriindet war; denn welche moralische Zusatze entweder damals schon, oder auch in der Folge ihm angehangt worden sind, die sind schlechterdings nicht zum Judentum, als einem soichen, gehorig. Das letzstere ist eigentlich gar keine Religion, sondern bloss Vereinigung einer Menge Menschen, die, da sie zu einem besondern Stamm geh6rten, sich zu einem gemeinen Wesen unter bloss po- litischen Gesetzen, mithin nicht zu einer Kirche formten; . . ." Insel, IV, pp 789-790.</page><page sequence="3">KANT ON JUDAISM-AXINN II political bondage to the Egyptian Pharaoh. The Maccabees were involved in political problems, among others. Kant's position takes the serious question to be the nature of the heaven that one hopes for, not the nature of the God by whose grace one hopes for passage. When he comes to the question of what is heaven, Kant gives us the kingdom of ends, an ethical commonwealth. The criticism that Judaism made its people, a political entity, the center of concern seems odd for one whose own position is directed toward a "common- wealth". From Kant's viewpoint, Judaism seems to be "God centered," and his own position is "heaven centered," but Kant is completely opposed to the idea that one can have any knowledge of any world outside of this one. He argues only for the possibility, but certainly not the actuality, of any other world. He is devastating in his criticism of the fetish religions that claim the ability to guarantee acceptance into heaven. For Kant, the only activity that can be called pleasing to God is activity that is, in itself, morally useful in this world. While he argues in his classically persuasively manner that only an intention morality deserves to be called morality, he also holds that none of us can look into the heart, the disposition, of any other. Therefore, social legislation can only be directed to behavior, can never reach to the area of intentions. Kant understands this as well as anyone whoever wrote. His criticism of the Ten Commandments is that they lay no requirements on the moral disposition. This is a rather strange remark since he says that these Commandments are valid as ethical commands: to have this status they must be directed to the moral disposition. Actually, they are far from limited to external behavior alone, for example, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house . . etc." To covet is to have a certain intention. Kant's argument that proper moral commands must "lay requirements upon the moral disposition" seems particularly odd in view of his own analysis of the nature and status of ethical principles. As Kant himself has frequently pointed</page><page sequence="4">I2 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW out, no command from outside of the individual can stand strictly as an ethical command unless it is also, at the same time, self imposed. One cannot be commanded to freely do the right thing. Therefore, no purely external command- ment can be directed to the inner disposition and be strictly ethical. Either the command is directed to behavior alone, outside of the area of ethics, or the command is one that the individual should also take to be self imposed. Kant criticizes the idea that there may be punishments that reach to the posterity of the criminal. It seems clear that this must strike Kant as having no ethical foundation, and we are not surprised to see that he himself rejects a rather similar idea in his Metaphysical Principles of Virtue. He explains what he calls "the idea of a divine penal justice." "Crime cannot go unavenged; if punishment does not fall upon the culprit, then his posterity must pay for the crime." 3 Ap- parently the concept of a future life in another world is of no service at all to the demands of justice. Perhaps it might be mentioned that Kant's notion of justice makes very pro- minent use of the principle of lex talionis. Just as Kant has accused Judaism of having no religion, at least one recent philosopher, Professor Stewart M. Brown, accused Kant of having no philosophy of law, 4 and for much the same reason. Consider Kant's third criticism. The Jewish conception of a 3 ,,Das Verbrechen kan nicht ungeracht bleiben; trifft die Strafe nicht den Verbrecher, so werden es seine Nachkommen entgelten muissen;" Insel, IV, p. 631. My reference to this passage out of context may be misunderstood. Kant mentions this idea of a divine penal justice in a section titled, ,,Die Religionslehre als Lehre der Pflichten gegen Gott Liegt Ausserhalb Den Grenzen Der Reinen Moralphilo- sophie," (Religion as a Doctrine of Duties to God Lies Outside the Limits of Pure Moral Philosophy). The section, and the book, con- clude with, ,, . . . die Ethik sich nicht fiber die Grenzen der wechsel- seitigen Menschenpflichten erweitern k6nne." (. .ethics cannot extend itself beyond the limits of the duties of man to himself and to other men.) Given this view, Kant's charge that Judaism limits reward and punishment to this world is not a Kantian moral criticism. 4 Stuart M. Brown, Jr., "Has Kant a Philosophy of Law ?" Philosophical Review, LXXXI (I96I), pp. 33-48.</page><page sequence="5">KANT ON JUDAISM-AXINN I3 chosen people looks suspiciously provincial to him. To the reader's surprise, Kant himself gives one interpretation of this that makes it quite a different thing indeed. In this same book on religion, talking about the question of whether the millennium should be seen as an event far off in the distance or close at hand, he says that we "must consider ourselves always as chosen citizens of a divine (ethical) state." 5 Kant also requires the symbol of a chosen citizen. Instead of a chosen people, Christianity has a chosen individual. Kant gives an interpretation of this that emphasizes the moral value of an example. In his Religion, Kant says that "we should not rate too highly the fact that this people set-up, as universal ruler of the world, a one and only God who could be represented through no visible image." 6 Why not rate this as a fantastically important contribution? Kant adds that "we find that the religious doctrines of most other peoples tended in the same direction ....." However, he provides us with no other examples. His own warnings against anthropomorphism and his warnings against sensuous representations of God, are in obvious agreement with Jewish principle. In his Critique of Judgement (sectionr 29), he wrote, "perhaps there is no sublimer passage in the Jewish law than the command, 'thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of anything which is in heaven or in the earth or under the earth...' This command alone can explain the enthusiasm that Jewish people in their moral period felt for their religion, when they compared themselves with other peoples. . ."

Let us turn to Kant's serious and repeated charge that Abraham's decision to sacrifice Isaac was immoral. Looked at literally, it was immoral. But Kant himself has presented the familiar view that the Bible must be interpreted before it can be understood. And, it must be interpreted in terms of the requirements of morality. One awkward alternative might be to start the history of Judaism after Abraham's fateful meeting, and restrict the history of Judaism to what can be put on a clear moral basis. This would be somewhat analogous to the pattern that Kant suggests for Christianity; he proposes that the Christian narrative be followed up to the death of Christ, but not beyond, to the Resurrection. Of course, Ju- daism without the story of Abraham and Isaac would not be recognizable. The serious alternative is to impose a morally useful interpretation on this story of Abraham and Isaac. A very suggestive interpretation was given by Professor Facken- heim in the article "Kant and Judaism" mentioned earlier. Professor Fackenheim puts it this way; "the otherness of the divine commanding presence is most starkly disclosed in that pristine moment of Jewish history, when the divine, first reaching to the human, calls it to its service. In that moment there are as yet no specified commandments, but only an unspecified divine commanding presence. Abraham is com- manded to go to another country without being told of the country or the purpose his migration is to serve ....... From Kant's viewpoint, there are three objections to this account. First, this talks of a service to the divine, and for Kant the only way to serve God is to serve man. Of course, if this can be interpreted as a service to mankind, this ob- jection would be satisfied. Secondly, this account holds that filhlte, wenn es sich mit andern Volkern verglich .. .

New York, I95I.</page><page sequence="7">KANT ON JUDAISM-AXINN I5 the event took place at a moment when there were no spe- cified moral commandments yet available. For rational humans, there is always a specified commandment: the categorical imperative existed for Abraham, if he was human. Thirdly, Fackenheim talks of a divine commanding presence, and Kant would deny that one can have knowledge of such a presence. I will skip ahead through Fackenheim's analysis to his conclusion. Abraham "does nothing less than accept the divine will as though it were his own." To accept another's will as your own, is to love. This interpretation holds that it's possible for man to act out of love for God. This far Kant can easily go with a sympathetic interpretation of Abraham's decision, but the next few steps may not be possible for him. If we merely stop here and take the biblical narrative to illustrate the possibility that man can sacrifice what is dear to him out of love for God, Kant would have some questions but no serious objection so far. However, if what is to be sacrificed is another human being, what Kant has called "the holiest being in the world," 8 then we have reached an impasse. Kant and Judaism part completely if one interprets Judaism as a preference for obeying God rather than obeying common morality. Is Judaism properly interpreted this way? Of course, if the commands of God and of common morality agree, we have no problem. But Abraham's dilemma illus- trates exactly the situation in which they do not agree. What then? We must apparently chose between theological morality and moral theology, to use Kant's phrases. At just this point we must be on guard against what Fackenheim calls "the apologetic tendencies that have marred all the standard Jewish responses to Kant." Perhaps I am also guilty of an apologetic tendency, with this one difference. I am apologizing for Kant. Fackenheim answers the question presented by Abraham's dilemma by holding that Judaism is both a moral 8 ,Der Mensch ist zwar unheilig genug, aber die Menschheit in seiner Person muss ihm heilig sein." This is the way he puts the dis- tinction in his, Kritik Der Praktischen Vernunft, Insel, IV, p. 2IO.</page><page sequence="8">i6 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW theology and theological morality. How can it be both ? Either intrinsic values determine morality or God's will determines morality. Fackenheim saves us from this desperate choice by holding that God "discloses himself through all intrinsic values, as being its ultimate source." And, if God's will is the source of ultimate morality, the optimistic con- clusion is that they cannot differ essentially. This is the op- timistic position: there is still the possibility that God's will, itself, is not consistent. An inconsistent God, like Des- cartes' thought of a malicious demon, is a conception that can be mentioned but not used. A careful analysis of this would require us to separate a Being whose own intentions are in- consistent from one whose intentions are to give us inconsis- tent commands. If God's will for our behaviour is consistent, his command- ments must make a self-consistent set. Then, if he is also the source of human morality, his commands must be consistent with human morality. If they seem to be inconsistent, Kant suggests that we can question either our conception of mo- rality or our assumption that we have in fact been given a command by God. Kant holds that the second of these must always be questioned: although we can think, hope, and be- lieve, we cannot knozw that we have a divine presence with us. Therefore, for Kant, we are never justified in opposing the demands of simple morality. As suggested above, the Abraham story must be interpreted. It must be emphasized that how- ever close Abraham came, however strong his pull toward obedience to God, he did not actually kill his son. The biblical narrative expresses in the strongest way the opposing force of two powerful principals, the two most powerful of all, and we are left impressed by their force but not yet swung over to either one alone. Abraham's dilemma in "that pristine mo- ment" was not solved by obedience to God alone. God would not have it that way, even if Abraham might have. Apparently, humans ought to have dual objectives, despite their ozwn proclivity to fanaticism. It would be fanaticism to pursue</page><page sequence="9">KANT ON JUDAISM-AXINN I7 just one of the two equally significant goals. What are these two goals ? In biblical terms, human objectives and the will of God. In Kant's terminology, individual selfishness and the kingdom of ends. Kant's specific criticisms of Judaism seem to be rather thin. One almost wonders whether he is praising by faint damna- tions. Let us look at some of the other "damnations." In his Religion we find, "Christianity possesses the great advantage over Judaism of being represented as coming from the mouth of the first teacher not as a statutory but as a moral religion, and thus entering into the closest relation with reason so that, through reason, it was able of itself, without historical learning, to be spread at all times and among all peoples with the greatest trustworthiness." 9 This again is a rather odd remark because Kant has already said that the Ten Commandments, statutory matters, are valid as ethical commands to the eye of reason. Apparently, statutory com- mands can be a part of a moral religion. Kant discusses Moses Mendelssohn's response to the sug- gestion that he change his religion. Since the Old Testament is supposed to be accepted faithfully as a divine revelation given to all men, according to Christianity, Kant says that "Men- delssohn very ingeniously makes use of this weak spot in the customary presentation of Christianity wholly to reject every demand upon a Son of Israel that he change his religion." 10 He reports Mendelssohn's argument that since the Jewish faith is, according to the Christians, the substructure upon which Christianity rests, the demand that it be abandoned is 9 ,,[Die christliche Religion] ... hat aber den grossen Vorzug vor dem Judentum, dass sie, aus dem Munde, des ersten Lehrers als eine nicht statutarische, sondern moralische Religion hervorgegangen, vorgestellt wird, und, auf solche Art mit der Vernunft in die engste Verbindung tretend, durch sie von selbst auch ohne historische Gelehrsamkeit auf alle Zeiten und Volker mit der gr6ssten Sicherheit verbreitet werden konnte." Insel, IV, p. 838. 10 The discussion of Mendelssohn appears in a long footnote added in the second edition, in Part IV of Kant's book. Insel, IV, p. 836. 2</page><page sequence="10">I8 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW equivalent to expecting someone to demolish the ground floor of a house in order to take up his abode in the second story. After appreciating his point, Kant says that "his real intention is fairly clear. He means to say: first wholly remove Judaism itself out of your religion.... ; we can then take your proposals under advisement." Kant adds that nothing would then be left but his own pure moral religion unencum- bered by statues. "Our burden will not be lightened in the least by throwing off the yoke of outer observances if, in its place, another yoke, namely confession of faith in sacred history - a yoke which rests far -more heavily upon the conscientious - is substituted in its place." Well then, Christianity imposes a yoke which rests "far more heavily upon the conscientious" than the statues of Judaism. In so many of the passages in which Kant says something about Judaism, we find him combining a compliment and a criticism. For example, a passage in part II of his book on religion in which he credits "the Jewish theocracy" with establishing a form of government "instituted solely for the public and exclusive veneration" 11 of the principle of mo- rality. A rather impressive compliment. It is immediately followed by a rather lengthy criticism, "yet since the spiritual natures of the subjects of this government remained responsive to no incentives other than the goods of this world; since consequently they chose to be ruled only by rewards and punishment in this life; and since, therefore, they were suited only for such laws as were partly prescriptive of burdensome ceremonies and observances, and partly ethical, but all purely civil, in that external compulsion characterized the law and the inner essence of a moral disposition was not considered in the least . . ." Of course, on Kant's own descrip- 11 ,Zwar verwahrte sich das gute Prinzip wegen seines Rechtsan- spruchs an der Herrschaft fiber den Menschen durch die Errichtung der Form einer Regierung, die bloss auf bffentliche alleinige Verehrung seines Namens angeordnet war (in der jiidischen Theokratie)," Insel, IVM p. 735.</page><page sequence="11">KANT ON JUDAISM-AXINN I9 tion of human nature, these criticisms hold for all humans as far as we know. The uniquely long history of the Jewish people struck Kant as "worthy of notice," but not a proof of a special divine purpose. He attributes the preservation to the fact that there was a written religion. "A people which has a written religion (sacred books) never fuses together in one faith with a people... possessing no such books but only rites..."2 He wonders that the Jews were able to maintain possession and under- standing of their sacred books for such an enormous period, and suggests that the Jews had assistance here because the Christian and to some extent the Mohammedan religions also assisted in preserving the sacred books. "For the Jews could ever and again seek out their old documents among the Christians . . . whenever in their wanderings their skill in reading these books and so the desire to possess them was lost ... and when they merely retained the memory of having formally possessed them." As possible support for this spe- culation (and he offers it merely as that) he mentions that "we find no Jews outside- the countries referred to if we except the few on the coast of Malibar and possibly a community in China and of these the first could have been a continual commercial relation with their co-religionists in Arabia." He then concludes that one can see in the preservation of the Jewish people either "the proof of a special beneficent pro- vidence saving this people," or "an example of punitive justice visited upon it because it stiff-neckedly sought to create a political and not a moral concept of the Messiah." 13 Again the criticism of the political orientation of Judaism. However, we also find him using a "political" interpretation 12 Kant's discussion of the significance of the length of Jewish history appears in a two page note at the end of Part III, just before the ,,Allgemeine Anmerkung." Insel, IV, pp. 803-4. 13 This remark is taken out of context. Kant's own conclusion is that the long history and preservation of the Jews is not evidence of any supernatural concern or divine purpose. We might say that no law of sociology was broken.</page><page sequence="12">20 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of God when he himself reaches for an interpretation of some difficult biblical passages. He discusses the strategy involved in interpreting Psalm 59, Ii-i6, where we find a prayer for revenge and Matthew V, 2I, holding that we should love our enemies and bless those who curse us. His own principle is, of course, that the Bible should be expounded in terms of morality rather than morality in terms of the Bible. Therefore, one is to look for a pragmatically useful interpretation that has the maximum moral benefit. Kant suggests that he would first try to distinguish between enemies in the flesh and invis- ible or spiritual enemies, evil inclinations. However, if this interpretation "cannot be managed, I shall rather have it that this passage is not to be understood in a moral sense at all, but only as applying to the relation in which the Jews conceived themselves to stand to God as their political regent. This later interpretation applies to still another pas- sage in the Bible where it is written: 'vengence is mine. I will repay saith the Lord.' This is commonly interpreted as a moral warning against private revenge ... ." 14 he remarks. Apparently he appreciated the use of at least one relationship to God, "as their political regent," that he found in Judaism. Let us turn now to the specific matters upon which Pro- fessor Fackenheim separates Kant and Judaism. We find five specific differences: i) Kant rejects a revealed morality. 2) Kant supposedly has a "hidden premise" stating that moral law is a barrier between man and God rather than, in Judaism, a bridge. 3) for Kant morality is a twofold and in Judaism it is a three-fold relationship. 4) they give different answers to the question, How can man act out of love for God ? 5) Kant denies and Judaism asserts that there is a gap between the divine and the human. On the first issue, the matter of the apparent contradiction 14 ... oder, will dieses nicht angehen, so werde ich lieber anneh- men; dass diese Stelle gar nicht im moralischen Sinn, sondern nach dem Verhaltnis, in welchem sich die Juden zu Gott, als ihrem politi- schen Regenten, betrachteten, zu verstehen sei, . . ." Insel, IV, p. 772.</page><page sequence="13">KANT ON JUDAISM-AXINN 2I between moral behavior based on revelation and behavior purely out of a sense of respect for the moral law, the se- paration is not as wide as it seems. Kant defines religion as the recognition of all duties as divine commands. He separates revealed and natural religion in the following way. If I must first know in advance that something is a divine command in order to recognize it as my duty, I have a revealed religion: in contrast, "that religion in which I must first know that something is my duty before I can accept it as a divine in- junction is the natural religion." 15 From the standpoint of Kant's distinction between revealed and natural religions, how does Professor Fackenheim see Judaism? Before one quickly answers in favor of the revealed position, note that Fackenheim reports that "Kant also refused - and again rightly - to divorce the divine from the moral. . ." If Kant is right about this position, then, as Fackenheim agrees in his conclusion, the status of Jewish revelation might very well be what Kant calls a mystery. Kant's definition of the term mystery may be rich enough to serve us here: he takes a mystery to be the category for something that we can know, but which we cannot communicate publicly. He separates the category of mystery from the category of the inscryutable. The inscrutable is defined as something which we can com- municate but something for which we cannot understand the cause. Kant holds that a man's duty cannot be a mystery, however inscrutable its base ... And then Kant contrasts the status of man's morality with the question of what God alone can do. He takes it to be a genuine holy mystery of religion when we know why something is to occur but we don't know what it is that occurs. The question of what God alone can do to assist us in being moral is just such a matter. We can answer the why question: because we need assistance. We cannot answer the what question: just what is it that God can 15 ,,, . . dagegen diejenige, in der ich zuvor wissen muss, dass etwas Pflicht sei, ehe ich es fur ein g6ttliches Gebot anerkennen kann, ist die nattirliche Religion." Insel, IV, p. 822.</page><page sequence="14">22 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW do to assist us? And Kant adds "it may well be expedient for us merely to know and understand that there is such a mystery, not to comprehend it" 16 Revelation can remain a religious mystery, but the publicly communicated -basis for morality must still be purely rational. How far is this from a contem- porary Jewish understanding of the position of revelation? Professor Fackenheim's second and his last point are hard to put together. If Kant sees moral law as "a barrier" be- tween man and God, we are surprised to discover near the end of the article that Kant denies "the gap" between the divine and the human. A quarrel over metaphors need not seriously detain us: it is not that Kant denies the gap between the -human and the divine, but rather that he denies that we have exact knowledge of how to bridge the gap. Fackenheim's third point, as I have it outlined, is the suggestion that morality is a two-fold merely human relation- ship for Kant; whereas it is a three-fold, a relationship be- tween man, God, and man, for Judaism. I think this is rather hastily stated. After all, in Judaism, there are no moral obligations to God. As Fackenheim states it, "a man walks humbly before God only if he is just and merciful to his fellow man; and a man is capable only of fragmentary justice and mercy unless he is humble before God. Here lies the very core of Jewish morality." Well then, God is present, but justice and mercy are relations to other humans. For Kant, the moral law is always present in its awful majesty, but moral obli- gations, are obligations to other humans. As Kant once put it, for the last man in the world there would be no moral problems. It would seem as if both systems are three-fold, moral re- lationships between humans take place in the presence of something else. Professor Fackenheim's fourth point is more difficult to deal with. He takes Kant's answer to the question of how man 16 ,, . . wovon uns etwa nur, dass es ein solches gebe, zu wissen und es zu verstehen, nicht eben es einzusehen, ntitzlich sein m5chtes'" Insel, IV. p. 8o6.</page><page sequence="15">KANT ON JUDAISM-AXINN 23 can act out of love for God to be something that "is not and cannot be the Jewish answer." However, what he presents as Kant's answer is for Kant an ideal that can be approached but never knowingly achieved. That is, "the oneness of the human with the divine will is assured once virtue is achieved." Yes, but it is never knowingly achieved in this world. The Jewish answer, for Fackenheim, is "that it is possible if God himself has made it possible." Apparently, he gives the same answer here that Kant gives to the question of atonement: that it is a genuine religious mystery, in his sense of the term mystery. What is the upshot of considering both the specific com- ments that Kant makes about Judaism and one recent dis- tinguished effort, Professor Fackenheim's, to distinguish be- tween Judaism and Kantianism? Of course one needs some precision for the term Judaism, and it is well known that any effort at precision here must cut through a host of problems. However, from the standpoint of "the classical Judaism of the Hebrew Bible . . ., " the reference that Professor Fackenheim uses, the parallels between Kant and Judaism remain striking. Of course, it's somewhat absurd to write as if Judaism were itself a perfectly consistent enterprise. But the challenge of Kant is this. In his book, Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone, he develops a "purely moral relgion," and a conception of the Deity as a moral ruler of the world. He does this, as his title boasts, strictly within the bounds of logic. His book could be called "the logic of hope." Any effort to separate one's position from Kant's on these matters would appear to pay an expensive price in the loss of rationality. It seems to me that there is nothing essential in Kant's religious view that a Jew must reject and much to be gained in clarity. While Kant's views are not sufficient for Judaism, I think that they are, at least, necessary.</page></plain_text>
