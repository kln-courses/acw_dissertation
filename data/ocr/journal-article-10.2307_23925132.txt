No. 3, September 2001 SADE: FORGIVENESS AND TRUTH IN A DE S ACR ALI SED UNIVERSE Beverley Clack Abstract This paper offers a challenge to the construction of Sade as a liberating figure by western intellectuals. Such readings invariably intellectualise and mitigate the sufferings of the victim in his writings. But rather than deny the need to engage with Sade's worldview I shall contend that this is vital, especially if one wishes to advocate a post-Christian spirituality. If one denies a trans cendent moral order or God, are we inevitably committed to the kind of universe Sade describes? Subverting aspects of Sade's own thesis can provide the basis for a meaningful vision of humanity grounded in this world. I. INTRODUCTION In his essay 'On Transience', Sigmund Freud recalls the following response that he made to a young friend depressed by the transience of natural beauty: A flower that blossoms only for a single night does not seem to us on that account less lovely.1 Freud's psychoanalytic theory is often seen as presenting a thorough-going materialism; yet this comment seems to suggest that life itself might offer depth, beauty and meaning. To take seriously this comment is to reflect upon what precisely might give human life its meaning.2 Elsewhere, I argue for a contemporary spirituality which is not based upon a transcendent set of values imposed upon the world from without, but which is grounded in the basic facts of human existence: that we are sexuate beings, born into this world, who will die. The aim of this article is to engage with the dangers inherent in such a position, taking seriously the possible impact of divesting this world of an ontologically distinct God or transcendent value 4 system. The literary work of Donatien-Alphonse-François, the Marquis de Sade, presents a graphic illustration of what such a world might be like. In many ways, his is the most serious challenge to the claim that it is possible to develop © Oxford University Press 2001</page><page sequence="2">BEVERLEY CLACK 263 a meaningful sense of life in a universe bereft of any transcendent God or moral order. In order to effectively engage with his work (and to combat his vision of the universe), it is necessary to first consider the way in which he has, in recent years, been appropriated by certain western intellectuals, who have invariably focused on the subversive or transgressive quality of his work. Under such a reading, the 'Divine Marquis' is accepted as a 'sinner', but as a sinner who challenges the stifling and stultifying norms of bourgeois society, whilst revealing something of the 'truth' of the human condition. My contention is that it is only possible to read Sade thus if his writings are intellectualised; in other words, if no connection is made between his ideas and real acts against real human beings.5 Such readings invariably avoid the challenge that Sade poses for liberal humanism. A more honest appraisal of his ideas will take seriously the objectification of the victim in his writings, not by arguing, simplistically, that Sade's ideas lead to particular acts, but that they present a world view in which the marginalised in society are denied a voice and thus are left vulnerable to the kind of abuses he details. Secondly, far from arguing that Sade should be burnt,6 I shall argue that we must engage with the world view he presents. If a transcendent moral order—or indeed a transcendent God—is denied, are we inevitably committed to the kind of valueless universe Sade presents? I shall argue that it is precisely by subverting aspects of Sade's own thesis (namely his emphasis on the isolation of the individual and his account of nature) that we can go some way to developing a meaningful vision of humanity and its place in the world. II. APPROPRIATING SADE: SADE AND THE ACADEMY Sade's admirers have sought to portray him less as an obscene author, and more as a revolutionary, subverting the codes of an unjust bourgeois society which oppresses individual freedoms. Under such readings, Sade's work is not read as simply obscene or pornographic. Rather, his apologists invariably interpret his overall intention differently from any overt reading which might be made of his work. Two distinctive approaches have been advanced for interpreting Sade's work. A. Ideas not Acts Under the first reading, an epistemic distance is placed between the events portrayed by the written word and acts which take place in 'the real world'. So, Camille Paglia in her discussion of Sade reminds her reader that 'these are ideas, not acts'.7 Her account of Sade draws him as a radical thinker, breaking down traditional hierarchical values through his muddling of gender and familial roles. In Sade's universe, human beings are not constrained by gender roles forced upon them by society. Men can be masochists, and women can</page><page sequence="3">264 SADE TRUTH AND FORGIVENESS rape and torture. A couple of examples will suffice to show the extent to which Sade plays with these gender roles and familial ties. Eugenie, whilst raping and sodomising her mother in Philosophy in the Boudoir, exclaims: Here I am: at once incestuous, adulterous, sodomistic; and all that in a girl who only shed her maidenhead today! Similarly, in 120 Days of Sodom, the President de Curval seeks to combine incest, adultery, sodomy and sacrilege, and so proceeds to bugger his married daughter with a Host.' Under Paglia's reading, such ideas are liberating for they challenge bourgeois norms concerning the basic structures of society. But such a reading can only stand if these are 'victimless' crimes; if, indeed, we are dealing with ideas rather than acts. Roland Barthes offers a reading of Sade which emphasises even more than Paglia's the importance of seeing Sade's ideas in light of the subversive nature of the written word. Barthes argues that there is an 'irrealism' in Sade's writings which suggests that the reader is not simply presented with a pictorial depiction of possible acts, but with transgressive 'performances of the discourse'. As he puts it: Indeed, if some group conceived the desire to realise literally one of the orgies Sade describes ... the Sadian [sic] scene would quickly be seen to be utterly unreal: the complexity of the combinations, the partners' contortions, the potency of ejaculations, and the victims' endurance all surpass human nature: one would need several arms, several skins, the body of an acrobat, and the ability to achieve orgasm ad infinitum. 1 While Barthes may have a point here, it is misleading to suggest that there has been no attempt by others to replicate some of these acts in this world. This is not to argue for a straightforward connection between Sade's work and particular sex crimes: having spent some time reading Sade's work I have not experienced any desire to replicate some of the murderous acts he catalogues! However, it should be noted that Sade himself did commit serious sexual assaults, even if his apologists like to play down the significance of these actions. There is also evidence that Moors Murderer Ian Brady 'self consciously defined himself as a follower of Sade'.13 Sade's Justine was a key text which, Brady claimed, informed his thinking.14 Obviously it is dangerous to conclude too much from limited examples. Yet it does seem to be the case that Sade exposes something of the dangerous desires of the human/(male?) psyche which necessitates that we grapple with him. The objectification of the other does occur in sex crime, and is invariably acted out upon the bodies of real others: women, children, and sometimes other men. We are not simply dealing with ideas: we are dealing with acts too.</page><page sequence="4">BEVERLEY CLACK 265 B. Forgiving Sade's Actions In seeking to reclaim Sade, his apologists invariably ignore the impact of his real life crimes on others. What happened to the poor women and prostitutes Sade abused was not really so awful, and therefore does not overly matter. Andrea Dworkin has effectively analysed the way in which this happens in the writings of the intelligentsia who act as apologists for Sade.15 In a sentence which could serve as her summing up on this matter she writes: What happens to men is portrayed as authentic, significant, and what happens to women is left out or shown not to matter.16 It is interesting to note that even those with a Marxist perspective which, one supposes, would lead them to identify with the oppressed, have sought to absolve Sade by considering his crimes against the backdrop of the society from whence he came. So we find Stephen Pfohl writing: Sade's crimes never exceeded the institutionally condoned violence of aristocratic and early bourgeois men against both women and the poor.17 But this point begs the question. If Pfohl had been Rose Keller—abducted, beaten, threatened with death if she tried to escape—would it really matter to him if that level of violence was no greater than that perpetrated by others at the time? The attempt to excuse Sade's acts in this way suggests an intellectualist bias: ultimately the woman/prostitute/victim is less significant than the man of letters. Sade's 'mind'/ideas excuse his acts. Bizarrely, bearing in mind the fact that many of his apologists seek to reject the cartesian dualism which underpins western society, they themselves espouse a dualist position. Innovative ideas (the male mind) are prioritised over acts (the female body). The aim of Sade's apologists is to secure for Sade a place in the western canon: to do so, it seems that his crimes must be forgiven, and his ideas distanced from the realm of real human suffering. Such a move may be plausible within an academic setting, but it is doubtful that this constitutes a truthful engagement with the man and his works. This is not to say that we should not consider Sade; my contention is that indeed we must. But I am unsure that his eminent supporters have really engaged with the vision of the universe which he presents. If we are to take seriously the valueless universe he describes, we must immerse ourselves in the horror of his writings: seeking to intellectualise the suffering portrayed in these texts mitigates the horror of his vision and thus lessens the challenge that he poses for liberal humanism. Sade challenges any attempt to establish a meaningful sense of human life in a universe emptied of transcendent value. The remainder of this paper will deal with precisely this issue. Without an ontologically distinct God to support our</page><page sequence="5">266 SADE TRUTH AND FORGIVENESS ethical structures, it would seem that we are condemned to accepting the violent and bloody account of the universe and human existence which he so graphically represents. III. THE S AD E I AN UNIVERSE In order to respond effectively to the vision of the universe which Sade presents, it is first necessary to consider the nature of that universe. At the outset, Sade rejects any notion of a transcendent moral order. And it is important to grasp the far-reaching nature of that rejection. It is not simply the rejection of a theological moral order based upon a transcendent God;18 he also rejects the notion that there could be a moral order based upon a high view of human being as distinct from the rest of the animal world. To this end, both God and Reason (that which has traditionally been understood as distinguishing humanity from the animals) are critiqued and rejected. The implications of such a rejection are far-reaching: humanity can be afforded no special status in the universe. As Noirceuil puts it, human being should be understood 'as something on the order of an absolutely material plant';19 there is no difference between a human being and a vegetable. To take such a claim seriously means the end of simplistic accounts of good and evil (in this sense, Sade presages Nietzsche). If there is no privileged position for humanity, then what happens to a human being is of no greater significance than what happens to a carrot shredded to be consumed in a salad. Murder simply involves entering into the destructive cycle of Nature. Thus the Pope tells Juliette during their dialogue, 'what can it matter if of a man I make a cabbage, a lettuce, a butterfly, or a worm ...?' This is what makes Sade such a frightening writer to read: and if we fail to find him terrifying, we have not read him properly. It seems strange, then, that David Coward argues that The Misfortunes of Virtue is superior to its reworking as Justine (1791) and The New Justine (1797), as these latter renditions 'add verbiage and horror but obscure the point'; after all, 'the point' is the horror! Without a transcendent moral order, based on God, Sade presents a universe where there is no justice, only the 'natural' law of survival of the fittest/strongest. There is, however, something of a tension in Sade's thought on this point. While Sade rejects both God and Reason as guarantors of the moral order, his libertines frequently make use of both to advance their own pleasure. Reason, in the shape of philosophical dialogue, is invariably employed to destroy virtue. So, much of Philosophy in the Boudoir is concerned with recounting the arguments which Dolmancé and Saint-Ange use to convince Eugenie of the 'truth' of libertinage. Reason, it seems, can be employed to dethrone God and received notions of morality. In similar vein, the God whose non-existence is proclaimed is used as the standard against which transgression can take place. So, the depraved Brothers of St-Mary-in-the-Wood dress</page><page sequence="6">BEVERLEY CLACK 267 Florette as the Virgin Mary and then give full vent to their passions which have been inflamed by the prospect of committing sacrilege.""" It would seem that even Sade cannot pursue his vision to its logical end: even a libertine needs a sense that there is some transcendental quality to the universe if he is to experience the 'true' pleasure of transgressing those very values. Leaving aside the tensions in Sade's thought for a moment, Sade replaces the transcendent God and the supremacy of Reason by prioritising Nature. Nature—or at least Sade's reading of what constitutes Nature—provides the blueprint for how we should act. Given the ambivalence of the natural world, Sade must decide upon which features he intends to use to construct his account of the universe. Not surprisingly, he highlights the brutal and the violent. There is a sense in which David Hume's famous picture of the amoral 'vivifying principle' which is Nature finds full expression in Sade's imagination.23 Thus, through Bressac, Sade says: Our acts of destmction give [Nature] new vigour and feed her energy, but none of our wreckings can weaken her power. So of what concern is it to Nature, endlessly creating, if a mound of flesh which today has the shape of a woman, should reproduce itself tomorrow as countless insects of different types?24 At least for Hume solace is to be found in the faculty of reason: Sade resists even that consolation. Having drawn Nature in such terms, it is perhaps hardly surprising that there is an ambivalent relationship between Nature and her 'followers', the libertines. Nature is both friend and enemy of the libertine. She is friend as she provides a basis against which the libertine can support his actions; but even then, Sade is at pains to portray 'the havoc of nature'.25 She is enemy, in much the same way that the mother is portrayed as enemy in Sade's stories.26 'Mother Nature' has the ability to crush even the libertine, in much the same way that the mother represents the possibility of returning to the undifferentiated state of the womb.27 This leads to a further feature of Sade's universe. The female and the maternal are to be resisted; as Barthes puts it, Sade is concerned with 'hiding the Woman'.28 Rather than exposing the sex organs of the female, they are more often than not covered, veiled, hidden. Sometimes this desire to obliterate female alterity takes a brutal turn: the fate of Mme de Mistival in Philosophy in the Boudoir is perhaps the most disturbing of the acts Sade portrays." Come to rescue her daughter Eugenie, she becomes her daughter's victim: Eugenie, now thoroughly schooled in libertinage, takes a needle threaded with a waxy red cotton and stitches up her mother's vagina and anus. It is surely no coincidence that such a fate should await her: mothers and the maternal are consistently denigrated and abused in Sade's universe. Bressac in Misfortunes of Virtue, who will eventually murder his mother, explains his desire</page><page sequence="7">268 SADE TRUTH AND FORGIVENESS to do so to Justine. He argues that there is no reason why one should respect one's mother as she plays no part in forming the child in the womb. Taking aristotelian biology somewhat literally, he argues that only the father's seed 'creates' the child, thus to kill one's mother is no crime (especially as she 'no doubt' enjoyed the act which led to pregnancy in the first place). Moreover, Bressac continues, he would 'never have raised [his] hand against [his] father':30 after all, he is the real source of Bressac's existence. Similarly, in 120 Days of Sodom pregnancy is treated as a crime, as attested to by the fate of Constance, who, after hearing stories of the butchering of pregnant women (which, not surprisingly, distress her), is herself tortured and then murdered by her chief tormentor, Curval, who cannot bear the physical signs of her fertility.31 Strangely, given the fertility of nature, it is precisely this feature of the natural world that Sade resists and finds repulsive. The cruelty meted out to mothers who reflect the fecundity of nature is mirrored by the fact that vaginal intercourse is seen by Sade's 'great' libertines as subordinate to anal sex.32 Commentators like Coward might argue that Sade is not particularly misogynistic: 'in Sade's world, obscenity and cruelty are the prerogative of the strong, irrespective of gender'.33 Yet the overall attitude to women and particularly female sexuality is more complex. The emphasis on anal sex is undeniable, as is the horror of pregnancy and birthing. Yes, there are female libertines in Sade's universe: Juliette and Mme de Saint-Ange being the most notable. But even Paglia, with her high regard for his presentation of such characters as 'high priestesses of savage nature',34 has to admit that he 'detests &gt; 35 procreative women . The liberated Sadeian woman proves to be something of a myth.36 She is presented with only two options in Sade's universe: be a libertine, or be a victim. So we find Juliette accepting libertinage and prospering, while her sister Justine refuses to reject virtue in favour of such a lifestyle, and finds that her torments grow greater with each passing day. Sade might reject the dualism of Church and Descartes, but ultimately he constructs his universe along the same lines. There is no alternative to the equally unsatisfactory options he presents: torture or be tortured hardly seems like a real choice. Similarly his understanding of sex is limited. He may reveal the dark side of human sexuality, where sex is associated with violence, force, and coercion: and if engaged with developing a spirituality which includes sexual experience, it is important to remember the ways in which sex can be used to the detriment of human persons. But sex does not always involve such horrors: it more often involves love, mutuality, and respect. To take seriously the universe which Sade presents demands a response. It might seem that the only way to avoid such horrors is to return to belief in 'good old God',37 the only effective guarantor of justice and humanity in the face of a rapacious and unforgiving universe. Such a move need not be</page><page sequence="8">BEVERLEY CLACK 269 necessary. The remainder of this article will argue that Sade himself provides the tools with which to subvert his contention that if the old securities of an ontologically distinct God or moral order are rejected, then the brutalising features of life as he describes it must be accepted. IV. THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF CRIME In Sade's universe the libertine does not necessarily act alone, and invariably is a member of a shadowy group known variously as 'the Sodality of the Friends of Crime' (Juliette), or the 'School for Libertinage' (120 Days of Sodom). Reflection upon the way in which such groups of libertines function holds the key to resisting Sade's vision. It would seem that libertine 'society' is the basis for Sadeian practice. A good example is to be found by considering the four 'friends' who devise the four month debauch which forms the basis for the action of 120 Days of Sodom. They are bound together by a complex network of relationships: Blangis and the Bishop are brothers; Curval is married to Blangis' daughter Julie, Blangis to Durcet's daughter Constance, Durcet to Curval's daughter Adelaide. Yet when one considers the actual behaviour of the libertines, it becomes evident that there is no genuine relationship, society or friendship between these people. Affectionate relationships are ridiculed, and familial bonds exist only to be perverted: the fathers mentioned above all have incestuous relationships with their daughters. A similar trend is to be found in Sade's other novels: for example, Juliette is involved in the deaths of her father, sister, and daughter, and her closest associates Olympia and Clairwil. Barthes is undoubtedly correct when he notes that 'sadian [sic] partners are neither comrades, chums, nor co-militants'.38 When Sade portrays human relationship, he alludes to nothing which is positive or life-affirming: there is no mutuality, no shared experience, no laughter. Indeed, isolation is the key feature of the Sadeian universe. The libertine is, despite his connection to such groups, a solitary figure who has no commit ments, not even to other libertines. In a sense, Sade's libertine is the logical outworking of the Enlightenment vision of 'Man' as a free, autonomous, self sufficient individual. Sade apparently pushes this image as far as it will go, revealing the possible alienation from others which results from giving too much credence to this account of human being. There is no sense that the individual might find their meaning in community or through relationship with others. The location for Sade's stories underlines this point: invariably they take place in remote, isolated places, where the protagonists and their victims are deliberately distanced from ordinary human commerce. So, Sade describes at length the difficulties of arriving at the Chateau of Silling, the backdrop for the events of 120 Days of Sodom.39 Such isolated places mirror the alienation felt by characters like Justine: with good reason she expresses her dislike of 'all solitary places'.40</page><page sequence="9">270 SADE TRUTH AND FORGIVENESS This sense of the isolated self is driven home when one considers the nature of sex in the Sadeian universe. While an infinite number of sexual acts are described (seemingly ad nauseam41 ), there is not a single example of Sade describing the touch or connection between those engaged in these acts. There is no sense of intimacy; his readers are simply presented with sexual acts expressed solely in terms of the specific bodily parts which these acts involve. In this way, the body is fragmented into a series of fetishisms, and the sex which he presents is de-eroticised. Describing the body thus does not just affect individual relationships: it affects the very possibility of human society, for 'when face is averted from face, emotion and society are annihilated'.4" But Sade's account of human relationship is not the only possible one. It is possible to maintain genuine relationship, connection and social community in the face of Sade's claims, even if the idea of a transcendent moral order imposed upon the world from without is rejected. Sade presents a view of human relationship mediated through an almost Hegelian dualism of oppressed and oppressor, libertine and victim. Clearly, there are situations in the world which reflect such hierarchical relationships; yet these are by no means the only ways of considering how human society might function. Sade resists any claim that there might be affectionate, caring relationships between people; but this is to ignore some of the basic features of human life. This piece began with a comment from Freud, and one of the central claims of psychoanalysis is that to understand the individual in isolation is to ignore the way in which relationships with others form that individual. For example, the psychic drama enacted between child and parents provides the cornerstone for psychoanalytic theory. Grace Jantzen has built upon such ideas when forming her account of natality as a key category for understanding human being.43 She argues that all human beings are natals, and reflection upon this idea may go some way to providing a defence against Sade's claims. Jantzen argues that emphasising the role that birth plays in defining humanity reveals the fact that all human beings are born into community. We are social beings. At times, we might be born into an inadequate community, but that does not negate the fact that we are formed through a network of relationships. Indeed, once the significance of relationship for defining our humanity is recognised, the need for justice in our dealings with others is made explicit. Thus, Jantzen is able to develop a sense of the values to be derived from human experience of this world (in this case, the fundamental reality of relationship), rather than offering an account of such values which sees them as only possible if guaranteed by an other-worldly transcendent (be that 'God' or 'the Good'). The claim that justice can be derived from reflection upon human relationship leads to a further tool with which to combat Sade. Sade's universe</page><page sequence="10">BEVERLEY CLACK 271 is defined by a particular approach to language. It is an approach which furthers the idea of isolation. In Sade's world, only the libertine speaks, the victim is silent;44 only the libertine acts, the victim is passive. To rework Luce Irigaray's famous comment regarding women: what would it be like if the victim/ the other could speak? What if the victim ceased to be a victim and became a survivor? In effect, it is the silence of the victim which allows the libertine to present their ideas as the only possible answer to a world emptied of transcendent value. Even when the victim is allowed to speak, their words are limited and have little force. So Justine's arguments are used primarily as a foil to those of the libertines. In rendering the victim silent, Sade works a sleight of hand. He presents a universe in which his reader is encouraged to identify with the oppressor/libertine. It does not matter what happens to the victim: in their silence they are rendered objects, mere ciphers. They are not individuals with whom one could identify. Yet if the victim could speak, that would destroy Sade's system. While this might not force the libertine or the abuser to see the other as a fellow subject, a fellow human being, it would force the reader to see the pain.43 I found reading 120 Days of Sodom quite unbearable because I could not see the children who are the victims of Sade's libertines as paper children: to me they were real. And once that imaginative step has been taken, Sade's world can be seen for the deceit that it is. Sophistry lies behind the libertine's case for his universe. In the words of the victim/survivor, or simply through taking that empathie step, the reader finds a common humanity which is being abused: and it is that mutual recognition which makes the kill or be killed ethic of Sade's universe wrong. Human connection challenges the isolated universe of the libertine. This connection can be made through language, but it can also be made through physical contact. Chantai Thomas points out that the outstretched hand never appears in Sade's writings:46 hardly surprising, as it is a symbol of connection, trust, and intimacy. In order to safeguard ideals of justice, it is not necessary to accept a series of laws ordained by a transcendent God: human contact makes it so. V. DEFINING NATURE: AGAINST 'CRUELTY' AS J USTI FI C AT I O N A further area in which a careful reading of Sade goes some way to negating his conclusions arises from his account of the character of the natural world. Sade's Nature is defined as brutish, unfeeling, callous, violent and destructive. It has to be defined thus in order to provide a justification for the callous, violent and destructive behaviour of Sade's libertines. In acting in the way in which they do, the libertines are simply furthering the ends of Nature. Talk of'Nature' is, of course, wrought with difficulties. Our experience of the world around us is always structured by human language and filtered through human categories of thought. In this sense, the habitual distinction made between 'Nature' and 'Culture' is difficult to maintain. It is hard to</page><page sequence="11">272 SADE TRUTH AND FORGIVENESS know what Nature might be apart from our apprehension of it. However, it is at least possible to be aware of such difficulties when attempting to describe the 'nature' of Nature. Such reflections highlight the problems with Sade's analysis. It is unre flectively anthropomorphic, drawing attention only to those aspects of Nature which support Sadeian brutality. It is disingenuous, for even at its most apparently brutal, it is difficult to equate Nature with the acts of Sade's libertines. After all. Nature does not sow up a mother's vagina; Nature does not torture and dismember children. Such acts are born of human volition and will. A more adequate account of Nature might usefully employ the method used by the Stoics when engaging with the universe. In seeking to 'live in accordance with Nature', their spiritual exercises suggest an imaginative decentering of human life, offering an account of human life grounded not in human concerns, but in the overall life of the universe.47 To employ such a method suggests renewed reflection on the world around us which need not lead to the conclusion that Nature is 'brutal'. The natural cycle may include elements which are not friendly to humanity, but this does mean that they are deliberately brutal. Indeed, if we consider those aspects of the natural world which can bring human suffering (for example, volcanoes and earthquakes), we see that these are part of the regulative cycles of the planet. According to geologists, such features are what makes the world a living and vital place. Without the ever-shifting geological plates on which the continents sit, and the earthquakes and volcanoes which ring them, there would be no recycling of carbon, and consequently no life.48 From a human perspective, such things may bring suffering, but without these features there would be no human life at all. In seeking to justify human cruelty, Sade offers an anthropomorphic account of Nature which misrepresents the 'nature' of Nature. He seeks to combine the model of human agency with the model of a regulative natural world: and this is simply not analogous. I might have will; Nature does not (or its only will is mine as I am part of the natural world). In order to resist Sade's view of the natural world, then, it is not necessary to provide alternative features to challenge his sadistic reading. We do not need to proffer a Wordsworthian Nature to balance his Baudelairean vision. Indeed, to trade in contrary examples is to fall into his carefully prepared trap. It is as if we have accepted his anthropomorphic Nature, but do not care for the way he has drawn 'Her'! If we are to effectively respond to his vision, there has to be the recognition of a major difference between human being and the self-regulating system which is nature. Our humanity is predicated on the fact that we can choose how to behave. We are not confined by the laws of nature in the sense that we can set in place value systems; we can create meaning. Sade's analysis of nature may be one-sided, in that he never alludes to the beauty of nature and the joy which can be derived from it; but, more</page><page sequence="12">BEVERLEY CLACK 273 importantly, it also supports too narrow and limited an account of the possibilities open to human beings. VI. CONCLUSION In seeking to present Sade as a subversive and revolutionary figure, his apologists reveal the dangers of over-intellectualising human life. Sade's vision is horrifying precisely because he wants us to find it so. Idealising the rapes, tortures and murders simply paves the way for further desensitisation to human suffering. Reading Sade in this way also enables us to ignore the real challenge which he presents to any meaningful account of human life in a desacralised universe. This is unfortunate, for grappling with his claims can provide a useful framework for a contemporary spirituality. If Sade rejects mutuality, any ethic grounded in human connection must be a relational one. Yet Sade's work also counsels against too easy an account of where such relationality might be located. The significance of sexuality has undoubtedly been ignored by the western tradition, and feminists, amongst others, have done much to redress the balance by arguing that this should be placed at the heart of any contemporary spirituality. Sade reveals something of the problems of such a move which does not think through the destructive ways in which sexuality can be expressed and exploited. To ground one's values simply in sexual expression can lead to a tiresome and monotonous sense of life's meaning. Relationality must be understood in a broader sense, emphasising the development of better relationships, both between human beings and with the natural world. By subverting Sade, it is possible, perhaps surprisingly, to arrive at an ethic based upon human connection and intimacy; an ethic which itself provides the basis for a contemporary spirituality.

A similar point is made by David Coward in his introduction to The Misfortunes of Virtue (Oxford: Oxford UP [1787] 1992): 'he was the victim of a moral backlash which might as easily have fallen on a score of aristocratic rakes' (p. xvii, my emphasis). 18 For example, Sade, The Misfortunes of Virtue, p. 123, where Mme Dubois rejects the notion of Providence. 19 D.-A.-François, Marquis de Sade [1797], Juliette, tr.

It is the fear of falling back into undifferen tiated nothingness which drives Sartre's discussion of this quality. 4 Barthes, Sade, Fourier, Loyola, p. 123. 7 For some suggestions as to why this is the case, see Barthes, Sade, Fourier, Loyola, p. 169. Barthes, however, is wrong to suggest that this is an isolated act: Justine experiences the same fate in the 1791 version of Justine (cf pp. 730-1). ' Sade, The Misfortunes of Virtue, p. 41.
