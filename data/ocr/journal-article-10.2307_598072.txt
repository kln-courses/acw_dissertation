<plain_text><page sequence="1">RAMAYANA STUDIES I THE KRAUgCA-VADHA EPISODE IN THE VALMIKI RAMAYANA CH. VAUDEVILLE PARIS THE KRAUNCA-VADHA EPISODE, narrated in sarga 2 of the Balakiinda of the VAlmiki Rdma- yana, is connected with the birth of the first sloka, uttered by sage VYlmiki when he was afflicted by grief, sooka, on hearing the piteable cries of a female krauici-bird, deprived from her mate.' Just as sargas 1 and 3 in the Balakainda of the vulgate Rdmayana purport to " explain" why and how the Rdmdyana came into existence, and which were the circumstances which induced Valmiki to begin his great tale, so the Kraufica-vadha episode, in sarga 2, is supposed to account for the birth of the Rloka, the principal metre used in the Ramd- yana. This pretty tale appears at first sight as a kind of fancy, a flight of imagination due to one of the later rhapsodists who composed the Bala- kadpa. Scholars and translators in general did not attach much importance to the episode, and contented themselves with a passing remark on the invraisemblance and fanciful character of the de- rivation Rloka &lt; sooka which seems to be hinted at in the episode, while crediting ValmIki with hav- ing given its final form to the epic Rloka, or having been the first to write an epic entirely in sloka.2 A closer examination of the Kraufica-vadha epi- sode, however, suggests that the passage is not so meaningless as it appears and that it does not concern the origin of the epic Rloka metre as such. It rather refers to an ancient tale or popular belief concerning the origin of lyrical poetry, which has a bearing on the origins of the ValmIki Rdmdyana itself. PLACE OF THE KRAUNCA-VADHA EPISODE IN VAL. R. I. 2. The Ramayana scholars, Holzmann, H. Jacobi, followed by C. Bulcke, have convincingly shown 1 The episode is famous in Indian tradition, and is referred to in AMvaghosa's Buddhacarita, Kaliddsa's Raghuvamha and in the works of the Kashmirian poeti- cians, but the latter seem to have understood that it was the female bird which had been killed by the Nisada, and the male bird which was lamenting its loss. (On the interpretation of this divergence, see G. H. Bhatt, "The Krauficavadha in Dhvanydloka and Kdvyami- mamsa," JOI vol. IX (1959), p. 148f., and Ch. Vaude- ville, " A further note on Kraufcavadha in Dhvanydloka and KAvyamimams&amp;," JOI vol. XI (1961), p. 122 f.). The story was also famous outside India, as it is alluded to in a 7th century inscription found in a Valmiki temple in Cambodia, cf. C. Buleke, Rdma-katha, Prayag, 1950, p. 240, who refers to BEFEO, vol. 28, p. 147 and JOI vol. VI, p. 117. Our references to the Valmiki text of the Balakanda are to the Baroda edition of the Vdlmlki Rdmayania (Oriental Institute, Baroda, 1958). 2 P. V. Kane, in History of Sanskrit Poetics, 1951, p. 320, note 1, is very affirmative: "Thus the Bdlaknida states the origin of the classical Sanskrit Aloka and also contil us the germs of the rasa theory." H. Jacobi, in Das RIimayana, Bonn, 1893 [English translation of the same by S. N. Ghosal, Baroda, 1960; our references are to the latter] says: " If this legend is based on any fact, the same appears to be that the epic Aloka in its regular form first emerges in the poem of Valmiki." (Jacobi, o. c., p. 62). Jacobi's view seems to have been accepted by Winternitz (A History of Indian Literature, I, p. 480). Hopkins, in The Great Epic of India, p. 65, re- jects the idea that Vdlmiki is the "inventor" of the Sloka: "We must let pass the statement of the Rdma- yana itself that V&amp;lmlki invented the Aloka verse, though Valmiki may have been the first to set out to write an epic in Alokas . . . ." Also, in note 2 to the same page: " That Valmiki could not have " invented the Aloka " is shown by the presence of an earlier form of Aloka in the Brahmanic literature retained in the Mahabharata."</page><page sequence="2">328 VAUDEVILLE: Rarmdyana Studies I: The " Kraufica-vadha" Episode that the bulk of the Bdlakanda (and also of the Uttarakdnda) is a later addition to the Valmiki Rdmdyana, and cannot belong to the Adi-ramayana nor be the work of Valmiki himself (who, more- over, is mentioned in the third person). Jacobi, however, assumes that, after the addition of the Bdlakanda, the former introduction to the "Adi- Ramayania" or "Diaskeuse" was transferred to the Bdlakdnda itself; the same scholar, therefore, proposed to find the real introduction to the Adi- Ramayana in vv. 1-4 of the 5th sarga, which consist of a Rdma-stuti.3 The first and third sargas of the present (vul- gate) Rdmdyana give a table of contents of the same. Of these two accounts, the first is obviously the older, since it does not include the contents of kind.as 1 and 7, which are given in sarga 3. Sarga 1 gives an account of the circumstances in which the Ramayana appeared, how it was " re- vealed " by divine Ndrada to the great sage Vdlmiki. We notice that the first two verses of sarga 3 are linked to the last verses of sarga 1 in a natural way: having heard Narada's tale, Valmiki concentrates on the subject and then makes bold to recite it in his turn: grutvd vastu samagramn taddharmdtma dharma- samhitam vyaktatmanvesate bhiiyo yadvrttam tasya dhimatah | 4 upaprhyodakam samyanmunih sthitva krtainjalih pracindgresu darbhesu dharmeninvesate gatim 1 Val. R. 1. 3, 1-2. It is likely that the contents of the first sarga, plus the two first verses of the third sarga com- posed a kind of prologue added to the Adi-Radm- yana. And it is interesting to note that this prologue refers to the poem as raghuvaimsasya caritam, i. e., "the history of the Raghu dynasty." On the contrary, there is hardly any continuity between the last verses of sarga 1 and the vv. 3 f. of sarga 2, which describe VYlmlki coming to bathe in the Tamasd river, in company of his disciple Bharadvdja, and which form the introduction to the Kraufica-vadha episode. The hiatus is all the more apparent as the first verse of sarga 2 seems to be a mere repetition of the first verse of sarga 3, quoted above: naradasya tu tatvakyam grutvd vdkyavisaradah piijayamasa dharmdtmd sahahisyo mahdmunih j / VA. R. I. 2, 1. Thus the Kraufica-vadha episode appears sand- wiched between the last verse of sarga 1 and the first verse of sarga 3 which is its natural con- tinuation, the two first verses of sarga 2 being added, rather clumsily, to provide the missing link with the former sarga. The Kraufica-vadha tale, which begins in I. 2,3, is interrupted rather abruptly after v. 21; I. 2, 22 introduces the god Brahma who comes to induce VYlmlki to sing Rama's glories " in slokas." How- ever, this encouragement is hardly needed, as it appears from I. 3, vv. 1-2, quoted above. But v. 21 finds a natural continuation in vv. 27-28 (whilst v. 26, which belongs to the Brahma-VYlmiki dia- logue is merely a repetition of v. 21). Brahma withdraws from the scene in v. 37, and the three stanzas that follow, i.e., vv. 38-39-40 seem to be the natural conclusion of the Krauica-vadha epi- sode. The last verse of sarga 2 (I. 2, 41) mentions that Vdlmlki composed a "poem on the praise of Rama" (yasaskaram kavyam) in hundreds of slokas Valmiki's authorship is re-affirmed in the first verse of sarga 4 (I. 4, 1), but this time the work is mentioned as "a great caritac" (caritam krtsnam). It follows from this analysis that the Kraufica-vadha episode narrated in I. 2, vv. 3-21, vv. 27-28 and vv. 38-40 is certainly independent of the Brahma-Valmiki dialogue, the latter being a late addition, clumsily interpolated in the former. Leaving aside the contents of the later summary of events found in I. 3, vv. 3 f., we can already distinguish a kind of double prologue to the Vdlmiki Ramayana: a. Val. R. I. 1; 2, vv. 22-37 (vv. 27-28 excepted); 3, 1-2 give a mythological explanation of the origin of the Rama-legend, which is supposed to have been the object of a kind of revelation by Narada to VYlmiki, the latter obeying an injunction from god Brahma. b. Val. R. I. 2, vv. 3-21, 27-28, 38-40 and I, 4 develop on a purely natural plane. The origin of sloka is explained by a pretty tale, but the origin of the Rama-legend itself apparently is no prob- lem, and sage Valmiki needs no special provocation 3 Jacobi, o. c., p. 44, " We should seek the beginning of the poem in the 5th canto," i. e., Val. R. I. 5, 1-4. Jacobi, ibid. p. 46, has attempted a reconstruction of the begin- ning of the text of the Adi-RAmAyana in this way: I. 5, 1-7; I. 6, 2-3-4; I. 18, 16, 22, 35 followed up to II. 1, 5 ff. (His references are to the Gujarati Printing Press edition of the Ramayana, Bombay.) 4A group of mss. belonging to the Southern recension insert 7 more stanzas after I. 3, 1. Cf. Baroda ed. p. [29], 154.*</page><page sequence="3">VAUDEVILLE: Ramayana Studies I: The "Krauiica-vadha" Episode 329 to take up his theme, as can be induced from the first verse of sarga 4: prdptardjyasya rdmasya vdtmikirbhagavanrsih I cakara caritam krtsnam vicitrapadamdtmavdn II krtvd tu tanmahdprdjfiah sabhavisyaM sahottaram cintayamdnasya ko nvetatprayunjiydditi prabuhu Val. R. I. 4, 1-2. The words praiptarajyasya rdmasya, "when Rdma got his kingdom," suggest that V5lmiki was the family bard of the Iksvdkus, whose duty it was to sing his master's praise after he has acceded to the throne of his ancestors. Here the only diffi- culty seems to be: how to account for the transmis- sion of the poem? The fact that the poem was in the mouths of the professional ballad-singers known as Kusllavas had to be explained. The Kusllavas were no court-poets or royal bards, but low-caste street musicians.6 How could they be in possession of that noble work dealing with the glories of Rdma? The purpose of sarga 4 is clearly to alleviate the difficulty by showing how the musicians' low status was heightened by the very nobility of their theme, and finally turned into some kind of respectable ascetics. It is logical to assume that the "natural" pro- logue is the older of the two. This prologue sug- gests that the -!di-Rdmdyana appeared to its hearers both as a wonderful achievement and as a curious novelty: the deep pathos of Valmiki's legend, its universal appeal, joined to a new refine- ment in style, caused the world to wonder. To the audience of the KusIlavas, the Iksvdku Prince Rdma must have been a well-known figure, the hero of some itihdsa or kirti told by a sitta of the Raghu family-but Vdlmiki's poem was something new, and unique. Their question cannot have been: " Where did Vdlmiki hear the Rama- legend? ", but rather: "Where did he take his inspiration? How did he come to sing the old tale in such pathetic and melodious strains? And how is that wonderful poem found on the lips of mere Kusllavas?" The pretty tale of the Kraufica- vadha, as we shall see, is precisely a Kusllava answer to such questions. It does not explain the origin of the Rdma-legend, not even how this par- ticular legend became Vdlmiki's theme. Its evi- dent purpose is to explain how "sloka" was once born of " s'oka," and to justify the KusIlavas claim over it. THE KRAUUNCA-VADHA EPISODE. a. Summary of contents. vv. 3-8: Setting of the scene: Valmiki comes to the Tamasa river to bathe. vv. 9-14: Vdlmmki sees a pair of sweet-voiced Kraufica birds. The male is killed by a Nisdda. VYlmiki is moved by sorrow (sooka) on hearing the piteable lament of the female bird. He curses the Nisdda, and his words take the shape of a sloka. vv. 15-17: VYlmlki wonders at his own utterance and stresses the relation between sokca and sloka. vv. 18-21: ValmIki reflects on what has come to pass, and, vv. 27-28: being under the influence of sooka, repeats the same sloka. vv. 38-40: VYlmiki's disciples sing the sloka again and again after their Master. Conclu- sion: sloka has attained the status of slo7ca. Before attempting an interpretation of the epi- sode, we must focus our attention on the key- words: lcraufica, soca and stoka. b. The Kraufica bird. The word kraufica shows the vrddhi of krufic or krufica (Hindi kunjh), a well-known species of migrator water-birds, the "Demoiselle crane" (Anthropoides virgo). The word is often and approximatively translated by French courlieu, English curlew or snipe, German Schneipe. Kruitc is already mentioned in the Yajur-Veda Samhitds, where the faculty of separating milk from water in drinking the latter (vipana) is attributed to it.7 5 After I. 4, 1, some mss. (Dt, D4. 6. 8. 9. 14) and Commentaries (Cr. m. g. t.) insert another Aloka, in which VAlmIki's poem is said to include "twenty- thousand Alokas "; but this verse is an interpolation; cf. Baroda ed. p. [36], 196.* 6 On the low status of musicians cf. Jacobi o. c., pp. 51-52, and notes 8) and 9); also Ranade, Religious and Social Reform, p. 185. Jacobi stresses the point that " these musicians must be distinguished from the court minstrels, sfltas." That low status may well have been that of ValmIki himself. On the latter, see C. Bulcke, o. c., p. 37-40, and " About ValmIki," JOI vol. VIII, 1959, p. 121 f.; G. H. Bhatt, " On Valmlki," JOI vol. IX, 1959- 1960, p. 1 if. 7 Cf. C. R. Lanman, "The milk-drinking hamsas of Sanskrit poetry," JAOS 19, 1898, p. 151 ff., who refers to four equivalent passages in the Vedic SamhitAs and the TAittiriya BrAhmana. In Maitrayani-Samhit&amp; III. 11, 6, Krufle seems to be the name of an Angirasa:</page><page sequence="4">330 VAUDEVILLE: Rdminyan.a Studies I: The "Krauiica-vadha" Episode In Vedic literature, kraufica is not an equivalent of krufic, but always a musical term, at least in older texts. It refers to a note, svara, in TS II, 5, II, 3-9); to several sdman in Tdnd. B. XI. 1, 18- 19, XIII. 11, 19-20, XIV. 11, 29, XIII. 9, 10-11: to a particular gana in Ch. Up. 22, 1; to an aga in JUB I, 37, 1-4. The kraufica note or tone is always given as the highest, and connected with the Asuras and with Brhaspati.8 As a sdman, in sacri- ficial context, its proper use seems to be for calling (or creating) what is "wished for." 9 When used in reference to birds, kraufica does not apply to a particular species, but to a whole class of aquatic birds endowed with a krufic-like voice, a class which includes, besides the krufic, the hamsa and sdrasa bird.10 Birds of that class regu- larly appear in Indian folk-tales as love-messengers from very ancient times, one well-known example being the hamsa sent by Damayant! to Nala in the Nalopaklhyna of the Mahdbharata. In the Epic, in the Kavya and also in folk-literature, the female of those species frequently appears as a symbol of an afflicted wife, mourning in separation from her Lord, cf. VMl. R. II. 39, 40 = jafnre 'tha tdsam san- nadah kraudcindm iva nisvanah / and II. 76, 21 kraunicindm iva narinam ninadastatra susruve / But, there, the kraunic is often replaced by an equivalent word kurari: thus Draupadl, abandoned in the forest by Nala is compared to a kurari (Mbh. III, 60, 19: kurarimiva), similarly SItM abandoned by Rdma in Raghuv. 14, 68: vigra kurariva bhiiyah. In later Vedic literature (cf. Taitt. Ar. I. 31, 2) and in the Epic, krauica is given as the proper name of a winged mountain which was shot at and pierced by Skanda (Kartikeya) with a dart given to him by Agni. The legend is developed in the VYyu and VYmana-Purdna, and frequently alluded to in Pauranic and Kdvya literature, where the epithets kraufica-darana, kaufica-nisfidana are fre- quently attributed to Skanda (once to Parasu- Rama in Megh. v. 59). Sometimes the Kraunca shot at by Skanda is given as an Asura.11 The Pauranic stories are clearly based on an old myth about the "piercing" or a divine kraui ca-bird (i. e., a bird with a kraunca-voice): all such birds must have been taboo, as evidenced in Manu-smrti XI. 136, which prescribes the gift of a cow to a Brahmin as an atonement for the killing of a 7crauiica. In the passage under consideration, it is clear that the Kraunacas are presented as a kind of sweet- singing birds, going in a pair: adbhyadh ksiradh vy-apibat kru'A dangiraso dhiya Kruic Angirasa is also mentioned in Tand.. B. XIII. 9, and II, 20, as the name of a seer who sings the saman Krauiica. 8 Cf. A. B. Keith, The Veda of the Black Yajur School entitled Tdittiriyd-Samhitd (HOS) Pt I, p. 201, the de- scription of the part of the Hotr in the new-moon and full-moon sacrifice in TS. V. 11, 3-9: "He sacrifices sitting; verily he finds support in this world. In that, he repeats the kraufica note, that is connected with the Asuras; in the low note, that is connected with men; and in the intermediate, that is connected with the gods." In note 3, p. 201, Keith remarks: " probably a high one." In JUB I. 37, there are given three aga: the lowest (mandra) belongs to Agni, the middle one, which is "loud and noisy" (ghosiny upabdimati) belongs to Indra; the third one (presumably the highest one) belongs to all the gods (cf. H. Oertel, "The Jdiminlya or Talavakdra Upanisad Bhramana, Text, Translation and Notes," in JAOS 16, 1896, p. 79f.). From I. 37, 6, one infers that the highest dgd is the krauica, which belongs to Brhaspati (atha yd krduica sd brhaspatyd). 9 Cf. JB III, 32, Caland, Auswalh, N. 173, translated in a note p. 268, in W. Caland, Pancavim8'a-Brrahmana (=Tn.d. B.), Calcutta, 1931: "Kruflc of the Angiras-clan obtained a day that was isya as it were; ( . . . ) isya, as it were, is this second day; ... .) There was (then) only one single day. This Krunic of the Angiras-clan desired: May I form a (second) day out of the (now only ex- istent) day. He saw this saman and practised it in lauding. Thereupon, he formed a (second) day out of the (single) day . . . It is this day, forsooth, that the Angiras Krunic by drinking discriminates." In Tand. B. the kraunica-saman is mentioned four times in a ten-days period which is the principal part of a twelve-day Soma sacrifice (XI. 10, 18-19; XIII. 11, 19- 20; XIII. 9, 10-11; XIV. 11, 29). By singing this saman, the priest creates and forms the day isya, i. e., "the hoped-for day" or "the day which should be found." Dr. H. Heestermaann notes that the expression isya meaning "day" is never found out of this context. There must be an allusion to a popular motif, distinct from the vipdna which is attributed to krauiica-birds. It is likely that a "Krunica-like song" or "tone" was already associated with the idea of "desire, longing" for a second (=for a mate ?). 10 The collective meaning of the word krauiica, applied to birds, can be inferred from a passage of Sayania's Commentary on TB. II. 6, 2.: yathd loke krui krauica- paksi (quoted by Lanman, o. c., p. 158). Krun-kraulhca- paksi can only mean: kruicldi paksi: "Krufic and the like." 11 Cf. Hopkins, Epic Mythology, p. 9 and 228; Wilson, VP p. 137-138, note 10. Wilson notes: " Kraufica is sometimes considered to be the name of a Asura; but this is perhaps some misapprehension of the Pauranic legend by the grammarians, springing out of the syno- nyms of Kartikeya, KrauncAri, Krauficadarana, etc." But it is more likely that the Asura Krauflca typifies the ancient association of the Kraufica note or tone with the Asuras; (cf. note 8).</page><page sequence="5">VAUDEVILLE: Rimdyana Studies I: The "Kraufica-vadha" Episode 331 dadarsa bhagavanstatra krauficayoscarunihvanam The birds known as krufica (lcunjh), like the hamsa, however, do not go in pairs, but in flocks, so that particular species can hardly be intended there. On the other hand, VYlmiki says that the Nisada pierced the male Kraufica with his arrow while the latter was 1cdmamohita "infatuated or intoxicated with love." This may allude to the peculiar kind of courtship indulged in by the Sarasa birds (another bird of the krauftca class) who go dancing about in a rather spectacular way.12 The Sarasa birds go by pairs, as also do the famous Cakravaka birds. But the couple of bird-lovers remain anonymous here: the poet does not mention their particular species: he simply introduces them as a couple of charming musi- cians, tenderly in love with one another. c. sloka and eoka. The Vedic use of the word Rloka; (whose ety- mology is uncertain) also brings musical associa- tions. In the Rg-Veda, sloka means a cry, also the noise of the Soma pressing stones, of chariots. In RV 3. 53, 10, sloka is given as the cry of the harysa bird and the priests themselves are compared to the hamsas: hamsa, iva Icrnutha slokam adribhih. L. Renou remarks that sloka is "un terme volon- tiers para-musical." 13 There is no evidence that sloka has been used in Vedic literature as the name of a particular metre.14 The association between kraunica meaning a musical tone, a type of chant, and secondarily a class of water-birds with a pathetic call (such a Icrauflca, sdrasa, hamsa) on the one hand, and Rloka, meaning a "rythmic cry," especially as uttered by the same kind of birds, is a natural association and must be very ancient, as already indicated in RV 3. 53, 10 where sloka is connected with hamsa. The Valmikian episode under con- sideration is another illustration of the same asso- ciation, but it introduces a romantic element, ap- parently based on popular belief: the cry of those water-birds is caused by sorrow or mourning, soka, so that the sloka sung by lcrauiica birds is really "born of ?oka" and expresses pathos, karunam. As we have seen, in the folk-tales, it is to the female of the species the Icraunca or 7curarn that this mournful lament is attributed. The despair of the Kraufc! bird on witnessing the slaughter of her mate is described in the Valmikian episode with a deliberate touch of anthropomorphism: tam so nitaparitangam vestamanam mahitale bhdrya tu nihatam drstva rudava karunam giram VA. R. I. 2, 11. "Seeing him thus slain and rolling in the dust, be- smeared with blood, his wife began to lament in a pitiful voice [or " with a mournful song]." The old word gir means: "invocation, praise, song" and also "voice." Here, the meaning "a mournful song" is all the more probable as the aggrieved KraufacI bird is explicitly mentioned as a " wife" (bharya), separated from her noble spouse. The word dvija in I. 2, 12 suggests that the Kraufica bird is conceived as a Brahman or as a prince. And it is the karua gfir, the mournful song or pathetic lament of the Krauiici which awakens karunyam, pity or sympathy, in Vdlmiki's soul, and which impels him to curse the sinful Nisdda in the famous verse: mdnisdda pratistham tvam agamah hdhvatih samah yat krauficamithunad ekam avadhih kdmamohitamjj VAl. R. I. 2, 14. This verse, which is supposed to be the first sloka ever uttered, is found with few variant read- ings in all manuscripts of the three recensions of the VYlmiki Rdmdyana, and is quoted or alluded to in a number of other works, in reference to the origins of the same Rdmdyana.15 However, it is 12 Cf. Salim Ali, The book of Indian birds, 6th ed. p. 87: " During breeding season, sarasa pairs indulge in ludicrous and spectacular dancing display, bowing mutually, prancing, with outward wings and leaping around each other." This evokes the apex khepari- bhramd, found in a variant reading for the section line of I.2, 11, (cf. Baroda ed. p. [23], 135*): drstva kraufThi rudodarta karunam kheparibhramd Boetlingk in the St Petersbourg Dictionary translates kheparibhrama by " in Lufe umherfliegend." Salim Ali has also noted the reputation of the Sarasa pair for fidelity and conjugal devotion," "which has won for the species popular reverence and devotion." 13 L. Renou, Etudes v6diques et panineennes IV, p. 31. 14 The s1oka mentioned in JB II. 27; II. 438; III. 338, 351, 367, 373, 385 are not classical Alokas. They are verses stating, under a more or less enigmatic form, truths concerning e. g., the connections between the phrases of the year or the pranas and liturgical details. They are rather to be taken as " utterances " and their metre appears to be variable; similarly the s1oka quoted in Tand. B. XXIV. 18, 4-7 in relation with the vratya sacrifice. 15 The verse is quoted verbatim in Bhavabhfiti's Ut- tararamacarita II, 5, Ksemendra's Ramdyanamai jari I. 19, Anandavardhana's Dhvanydloka (Kdvyam1la ed. N. 25) and Abhinavagupta's Locana Commentary on the Dhvanydloka (p. 160 in the Madras ed.). About the interpretation given to the verse by the Kashmirian poeticians, cf. supra note 1. AAvaghosa in Buddhacarita</page><page sequence="6">332 VAUDEVILLE: Rdmdyaia Studies I: The " Kraufica-vadha" Episode not a regular epic sloka, but a vipula verse, com- ing nearer to the late Vedic anustubh. Besides, the use of the augmented form agamah with ma is not grammatically correct: one would expect ma ... gamah; the anomaly which must have been sensed by the copyist of the Dig and Si ms, which give the form agamah (from verb d-gam) instead of agamah.16 The word pratistha means "resting-place, resi- dence, dwelling" and, secondarily, "honour, fame." The first line of the verse has generally been understood as meaning: "Thou shalt never attain fame"; but the first sense of the word appears more fitting in the context. The maledic- tion must be: "O Nisdda, thou shalt remain for ever without a dwelling " (i. e., " thou shalt be con- demned to wander forever,") a malediction which is consistent with the half-nomadic habits of the Nisadas, an aboriginal tribe of hunters and fisher- men.17 There is evidently a correspondence be- tween the word pratistha, " dwelling," and the word ni4sada, "settler." However, this malediction, as it appears in the Kraufica-vadha episode, is anomalous: the cruel Nisdda is abruptly introduced and disappears in the same way: we do not hear of his subsequent fate, and of the effect of the malediction; more unexpected still is the fact that the malediction is not voiced by the aggrieved Krauficl, but by the sage VYlmiki, an occasional spectator. It is the "wife" of the dvija bird who should have cursed the Nisdda, just as the young hermit's father, bereaved from his son, curses king Dasaratha in the Ayodhyakianda (II. 64, 56). One may surmise that the verse is a quotation from an older ballad, in which a cruel Nisdda was cursed by a female Kraufac! bird, symbolising a sorrowful wife sepa- rated from her Lord. The following verses, 15-17, establish the rela- tion soka-sloka. The second line of verse 15: sokartendsya sakuneh kim idam vyahrtam maya shows that VYlmiki uttered the malediction while he was affected by the " soka of that bird," or by " sorrow on account of that bird." V. 17 is a deli- cate interpretation. Addressing his disciple Bharadvaja, Vdlmiki says: padabaddho'ksarasamastantrilayasamanvitah I Aokdrtasya pravrtto me Aloko bhavatu nanyatha VA. R. I. 2, 17. We notice, first of all, that the "definition" of the sloka which is given in this verse does not allude to the rules of the classical sloka: the s'oka alluded to here is simply a stanza made of four quarters (pada), each with an even number of syllables, and corresponding to a laya (measure) on the tantri or lute. We may doubt that this purports to be a "definition" at all, as it does not mention the characteristics of the metre as such, i.e., the metrical and semantical arrangement of the pddas in pairs (the typical couplet form of the sloka) and the peculiar metrical fall of each pada in one hemistich. If this is to be taken as a definition, then it is so wide as to include under the name of sloka all the ancient types of quat- rains, from the old Vedic tristubh and jagati to the later Vedic anustubh and pre-classical s'oka, since the number of syllables in a pdda is not pre- cised.18 On the other hand, the sloka referred to here is clearly a geyaripacka, i. e., a type of verse not simply recited or chanted, but sung with musi- cal accompaniment, a typically popular form of entertainment. Here we find again the ancient Vedic association of s'oka with music.19 In verse I. 49, recalling the event, replaces the word Aloka by padyam: valmikanadahca sasarja padyam jagrantha yan na cyavano maharsih "A cry of Valmiki gave birth to the "verse" (or " metre "?) " which the great Isi Cyavana had not composed." "6 Cf. Baroda ed. p. 24, and G. H. Bhatt, " BAlakAnda in Ksemendra's RAmAyan1amanjarl," JOI vol. VII, p. 180- 181. The reading dlabdha1h instead of agamah in the latter work seems to be an attempt on the part of Ksemendra to do away with the anomalous form agamah. '17 The Nisadas appear in later SamhitAs and in the Brahmanas as wild Non-Aryan tribes of hunters, fisher- men and robbers. It seems that the word is a general term for non-Aryan tribes, rather than the name of a particular one. The name nisdda, from ni-sad, means "settlers" and it appears from Vedic literature that these were at least partly sedentary at the time of the BrAhmanas. The ritual of the Viivajit sacrifice requires a temporary residence with Nisadas; cf. Macdonell, Vedic Index, and Weber, Indische Studien 9, 340. The Brhatsamhitd of Varahamitra (XIV. 10) recognizes a "kingdom" (rdstra) of NisAdas in the South-East of Madhyadega. 18 Hopkins (o. c., p. 266 and note 2) has shown that o1oka, in the broad sense, is equivalent to gatha. In Mbh. XII. 192, 5if., one unannounced Aloka follows the introductory verse, then more prose, and, with the words bhavanti 'ca 'tra glokdh, follow one 41oka and two tristubh: Hopkins concludes: " evidently s1oka here does not mean tristubh, but includes them with 'Aloka' proper." 19 Hopkins (o. c., p. 51) shows that 4loka, though synonymous with gatha, may be either sung or recited. But the very word gatha reflects older conditions where bards actually sang with the accompaniment of the</page><page sequence="7">VAUDEVILLE: Rdmdyana Studies I: The "Kraufica-vadha" Episode 333 39, we find the same view expressed again about four pddas with an equal number of syllables being characteristic of Rloka, born of soka. The second line of verse 17 brings the doublet Rloka-soka. It seems that all commentators and European translators have taken the word Rloka as a predicate in the last pada; Rloko bhavatu nanyatha. Dutt translates: "As it has come out of my sorrow (4oka), let it there- fore go forth as hloka." 20 and Roussel, in his French translation of the VYlmiki Rdmdyana: "Cette parole, liee par des padas aux syllabes symdtriques, accompagnde d'instruments a cordes et cadencee, puisque je 1'ai prononcde dans mon affliction, que ce soit un Aloka, pas autre chose." If we take sloko as a predicate, the subject of bhavatu is not expressed and should be understood. But, taking sloko as a predicate after bhavatu is not satisfactory, as bhavatu ndnyathd is a well- known expression used after a prediction or malediction, with the meaning of: " let those words not be altered," " let it be so." ?loka should rather be taken here in the ancient meaning of " rythmed, musical uttereance," as the subject of the verb bhavatu: "Let this sloka (which is divided in padas, etc.), uttered by me, afflicted by the hoka of that bird, endure for ever." The words bhavatu nanyatha may be interpreted here as meaning either "let the form of the sloka be not altered," or "let this malediction be not altered." The importance given to the form of the sloka in the first line of the verse suggests that the former interpretation is to be preferred. Here, the malediction seems already forgotten, and the sage wonders at the beautiful lyrical quatrain born of soka. ?loka, therefore, is a musical quatrain not etymologically derived, but inspired by sooka, and which found its first expression in the pathetic song (karuna gir) of a Kraufaci-bird. Far from being fortuitous, the association sokWa- sloka is strongly emphasized in two more verses, vv. 28 and 39, which complete the episode by show- ing the transmission of the same sloka: socanneva muhuh krauficim upa h2okam imam punah jagdvantargatamand bhiltv&amp; gokaparayanah| Val. R. I. 2, 38. Most of the commentators and translators of the Rdmayana have joined upa and sloka into one word: upasloka. Jacobi writes hesitantingly " sein: Mitleid in einem Upasloka ( ?) losringt." 21 But there is no such word as upasloka. It is much more likely that upa is to be taken here as a sepa- rable prefix, and that it should be joined to the following verb jagava. Upa-ga means "join in singing" (cf. the meaning of the prefix upa- in upaicrama: doing something for another, helping in"). The verse, therefore, should be translated: "Lamenting incessantly, he joined the Krauficl in singing this sloka again, Being lost in his thoughts and a victim of soka." The wording of the verse suggests that the sloca sung by VlmIlki is the very song (gir) of the lamenting Krauficl, in which he has joined spon- taneously, as he himself came under the influence of soka. V. 38 introduces Vdlmiki's disciples, who, in their turn, join in the singing of the same sloca: tasya *isyastatah sarve jaguh Alokam imam punahl muhurmuhuh priyamaunih prahugca bhrhavismitah | Val. R. I. 2, 38. "Then his disciples began to chant the Aloka all together in their turn, and they repeated it again and again, with great pleasure and wonder." In v. 39, which refers to v. 17, we find the natural conclusion of the Kraufica-vadha episode: samiksaigcaturbhiryah pddairgito maharsitzd so'nuvydharandd bhfzyah siokah glokatvamdgatah l "This Aoka which was sung (gitah) by the great Rsi, with four pddas and an equal number of syllables [in each], through being repeated (anuvyaharanddbhilyah: " sung after") has attained to the nature of Aloka.' This last verse appears a little enigmatic. It adds nothing to the definition of sloca, given above, but it seems to imply that it is sokca itself which turned into sloca, or assumed "the nature of slolca" (slocatvam),22 when it was sung by a tantri. This is also what is implied in this passage: the Kugilavas, to whom the Adi-RAmAyana was entrusted were not mere reciters, but also singers and musicians. 20 Cf. also M. N. Sen: "And since it is born of my Shoka (grief), let it be known as Sloka (or Verse)." Griffith: "The measured form of words I spoke In shock of grief be termed a sloke." 21 Jacobi, Das Rdmdyawna p. 140. 22 Cf. Raghuvamga 14. 70: nisaddaviddhdndajadarganotthah glokatvamdpadyata yaya hokah and Dhvanydloka I. 5: krauftcadvandvaviyogotthah sokah s'lokatvamdgatah.</page><page sequence="8">334 VAUDEVILLE: Rdmjyanta Studies I: The "Krauitca-vadha" Episode Kraufci bird, then repeated by Valmiki, and again repeated by Valmiki's disciples. This verse has embarassed the commentators of the VYlmlki Rdmdyana. Several manuscripts, with the commentaries of Mahesvaratirtha and Govindardja, show a correction Rlokah [secundo manu] instead of sookah. The Kataka Commentary of Kataka Yogindra explains: "Those words which have ooka as a subject, on ac- count of their remembering the episode, being repeated again, by chance remain changed into Aloka." So, here, sooka is explained as sokavisayakasabda; but the commentary of Govindardja seems to fol- low more closely the text: "By the reading hoka hlokatvamdgatah, one must understand that hloka made of hoka may be called hoka." The Sanskrit root suc does not mean only "to feel pain " or "to regret," but also "to lament " and "to mourn," especially to mourn the loss of a dear one, and is used in this sense in the Mehd- bharata, often coupled with vilapa.23 Thus soka has also the double meaning of "sorrow" and "lament"; a "lament" may be sung, and, as we have just seen, VYlmIki and his disciples join in the mournful song (karuna gir 24) of the Kraufiac bird. The Kraufica-vadha episode suggests the pre- existence of popular songs or ballads on the theme of separation, whose a female singing bird of the kraufica type, symbolising a wife, expresses her sorrow in pathetic strains. If we suppose that this type of songs were popularly known as soka or soka-vilapa, and were sung with the accompani- ment of the tantri, the meaning of verse 39 is clear: "The lament [of the Kraufic! bird] sung by the great ]si, by being repeated after, gained the nature (or attained the status) of Aloka (lyrical utterance) ." What seems to be alluded to in this verse is the passage from a form of folk-song (sokca) to lyrical poetry of a high order (sloka) such as is found in Vdlmiki's noble work. The Kraufica-vadha epi- sode does not explain the birth of the sloca metre, but it clearly suggests that Valmiki derived his inspiration from a type of folk-balled sung in the pathetic mood. As we have already seen, it is likely that the famous verse ma nisdda . . ., which Valmiki "sings after" the Krauncl-bird, is itself a quotation from a well-known ballad of this type. The association sloca-soca is not found in the Brahmd-VYlmiki dialogue which follows the Kraufca-vadha episode. There, Brahma inter- venes in order to convince Valmiki that he should tell the story of the Ra-mayana (rmaryanasya kath~d) in "slokas." It is likely that the slokas here mentioned do refer to the particular metre of this name, but this dialogue, as we have shown, is artificially linked to the Kraufca-vadha episode, and is probably a later addition. The contents of the 4th sarga mainly agree with the Kraufca-vadha episode. The "great Rdmd- yana " which VYlmiki teaches to the two KusuTlavas, wonderful singers and musicians (gayakau), com- pared to the celestial Gandharvas, is a poem des- tined to be both recited and sung25 with the ac- companiment of the tantri. And the hermits them- selves are so enthralled by the "sweetness" (ma- dhura) of the song that they bestow on the poor Kus'Ilavas the apparel of hermits, as a mark of their new dignity. CONCLUSION Besides pointing at folk-poetry as the main source of inspiration for the Adi-Rdmayana, the introduction of the Krauica-vadha as a prologue to the poem, suggests that the rhapsodes sensed an analogy between the heroine of the tale, the Kraufic!-bird, and the heroine of ValmIki's poem, Sltd. A Krauficl-bird symbolises a faithful wife tormented by the pain of separation, such as the faithful Sltd in the Sundarakinda. It may well be that the pativratd Sita, was the central figure of the Xdi-Rdmdyana.26 In fact, in Balakanda I. 4, 6, the subject of "the great Ramayana" is summed up without any reference to IRma himself: 23 Cf. Mbh. III. 60, 19: karunam bahu socantim vildpantim muhurmuhuh Mbh. III. 60, 21: ndtmdnam Aocati tathdyathd Aocati naisadham also Val. R. III. 6: rajiah Aoka-vildpaca. 24 It is worth noting that the word karuna (karuinyam) which occurs three times in the passage (v. 11 karunam giram; v. 12 kdrunyam; v. 13 karunaveditvdd) is from the root kri: " to pour out, scatter"; the primitive sense of karuna is "lamentable," that which draws out an expression of pain or compassion. 25 It is referred to as gita in I. 4, 16; however a gita may also be recited; cf. Hopkins, o. c., p. 51 and supra note 19. 26 Cf. the opinion of Winternitz, A History of Sanskrit Literature, vol. II, p. 513.</page><page sequence="9">VAUDEVILLE: Rimdyana Studies I: The " Krauitca-vadha" Episode 335 kavyam rdmayanam krtsnam sitdydscaritam mahat paulastyavadhamityevam cakdra caritavratahi VAl R. I. 4, 6. "He [VdImiki] taught them the great RAmAyana, that is to say the SUtR-legend and the legend of the de- struction of Paulastya." The unexpected importance given here to SItA and her ravisher, Rdvana, as the main characters of the legend, is striking. It evokes a number of non-Valmikian IRmdyanas, especially in the Jaina tradition of Gunabhadra, where SItM appears as the central figure.27 The Kraufica-vadha episode, followed by sarga 4 of the Bdlakanda seems to be the Kus'llava ex- planation of the peculiarities of the Rdmdyana, as they knew it. The rhapsodies of the Adi-Rdma- yana were well-aware that the poem, being com- posed entirely in loka, i. e., in verse, to the exclu- sion of prose, constituted a new "genre," clearly distinct from the ancient pre-epic ikchydna, made of prose and verse.28 Moreover, though having as its hero the noble figure of Rdma, a well-known Prince of the Iksvdku dynasty, the Rdmdyan.ia told by VYlmiki was not similar to a kirti or itihasa, told by a bard or sata, like the MahAbhfrata. Its inspiration was not mainly heroic: the legend cen- tered round the trials and sorrows of a faithful wife, the pativratd SHtE; the element of pathos (karuniam) was predominating, and the appeal of the poem was universal, and was deemed irre- sistible. That marvellous poem was not only recited and chanted, it was at least partly sung with musical accompaniment on the tantri by wandering musicians, the Kus'llavas themselves. Jacobi, while stressing the distinction between the court-minstrels, sfitas and the Kus'ilavas, seems to accept the view that VYlmIki's poem was made of no other stuff than " the epic songs of the bards ": " He [Valmiki] connected the features scattered in different songs and composed a consistent epos " ( . . . ) The epos of Valmiki was then learned and propagated by the Kugilavas." 29 Yet, even apart from the clues given in the Kraunca-vadha episode of the Bdlakind.a, con- sidering the character of the poem itself in its most ancient parts, there would be ample reason to be- lieve that bardic poetry could not be the only source from which VYlmiki has drawn.30 If the bardic element was really predominating in the Adi-Rdmayana, it would be even more difficult to explain how this "epos" became the monopoly of the street-singers Kus'llavas, who communicated it to the world. Even if VYlmIki was not himself a Kus'lava, he was regarded as a famous poet-cum- musician, and all IRmayan.ia-singing Kus'ilavas honored him as their patron-saint. Because of the well-deserved renown of VYlmiki's poem, and its relation to the exalted hero, Rdma of the kingly race of Iksvdkus, the relation of the Kus'llavas to that poem, and to Valmiki himself, had to be accounted for, considering the low status of the former. We believe that the first prologue added to the Adi-Rdmayana is the Kus!l1ava traditional reply, and apology. While asserting their ancient right on the great Rdmayana, the Kus'ilavas hinted at one of the main sources of the poem: lyrical folk- poetry, i. e., the very tradition which they repre- sented. In telling how sloka was once born of Moka, the Kus'ilavas meant to uphold their own traditional belief on the source of Valmiki's in- spiration: the Krauflca-vadha episode points to popular songs on the theme of the sorrows of a faithful wife in separation-a type of song whose heroine was commonly a Kraucil-bird-as one of the main sources of the reimdya.nam kavyam. 27A number of Jaina RdmAyanas are actually called Sitd-carita (or Siya-cariya) cf. H. R. Kapadia, "The Ramdyana and the Jaina writers," JOI vol. I (1951-52) p. 115 ff.; for the Gunabhadra tradition, cf. C. Bulcke, o. c., p. 68 f., and Nathuram Premi, Jain Sihitya aur Itihas, p. 182. The source of the Uttarapurana of Guna- bhadra (end of IXth c.) is unknown: probably oral popular traditions. In his Commentary on his own Yogagdstra, Hemacandra gives a brief version of the Rdmayaiia legend under the name of Sit -Ravaina- Kathanaka, which appears to be earlier than his treat- ment of the story in the Trisastis'daapurusacarita. Commenting on this version, V. M. Kulkarni (" Sita- Ravan.a-Kathanaka of Hemacandra," JOI vol. VII (1958), p. 171) remarks that the title is "striking," as it excludes the very name of RAma, and the same author tries to account for the omission by saying that Hema- candra's intention was then to illustrate an ethnical truth " that the mere desire to dally with another's wife brings total ruin." The explanation does not appear convincing, especially if one takes into consideration the whole series of Jaina renderings of the RAmayana legend. One cannot but feel that such a title corresponds to a slightly different version of the legend, which centered on the woes and trials of the faithful SIM. 28 On the old pre-epic dkhydna, cf. Oldenberg, ZMDG, vol. XXXVII, 1883, p. p. 54 ff. Examples of that mixed style are found in the Mahabharata, and one tale of the prose-verse variety is found complete in the archaic story of the Frog-girl, Mbh. III, 193; cf. Hopkins, o. c., p. 266. 29 Jacobi, o. c., p. 52 and note 9. 30 The problem of the non-bardic sources of the Rama- yana deserves a careful investigation, to which we hope to contribute by further papers.</page></plain_text>
