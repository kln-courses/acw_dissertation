Scholars are becoming increasingly aware of the serious handicaps that are imposed on research and on the dissemination of its results by the bottleneck of publication. Costs mount continuously and most editors are forced to refuse meritorious manuscripts or post- pone their printing for months and often years. Authors seldom dare to include as complete documentation of their work as they wish-tables, drawings, photo- graphs, plans, all must be held to strict limits lest the length and elaborateness of the manuscript prove fatal to its chances for publication. One partial solu- tion to this predicament, the private circulation of typed reports, pictures, and notes, is even at best inade- quate and expensive; ironically, it forces on the scholar the very difficulties that the invention of printing with movable type was expected to alleviate. At the present time, the need is for a means of reproduction so inex- pensive that manuscripts of any length can be quickly made available without the necessity of large sales to repay the costs of publication. The success during the past year and a half of Archives of Archaeology demon- strates that microcards are the long-sought method of reproduction. Microcard publication requires a machine for read- ing, of course, since each typed page of the manuscript is reduced to about one quarter by one half of an inch. But most libraries now have at least one of the three types of reader available, and operation is ex- tremely simple and convenient. The cards, approxi- mately 3 by 5 inches, each bear a heading easily read with the naked eye that indicates author, title, and the pages that occur on that card. Each card carries about 90 pages of the text, illustrations, or other material. Microcards are positive photographic prints, and there-</page><page sequence="2">1961] BOOK REVIEWS 333 fore reproduce directly from the original, with faithful detail, anything that can be photographed. No type- setting or engravings are involved. In the long run the advantage of low cost of publication will probably be equalled, at least in the judgment of librarians, by the savings in space that result. In the present series eleven titles have been issued thus far, reproducing 2418 pages of manuscript, yet they occupy less than one inch of a 3 by 5 file drawer. Offset or letterpress publi- cation would have resulted in a series of Ix volumes that would have filled a foot or more of shelf space. Archives of Archaeology has been planned for the publishing of primary documentation of investigations in or related to the New World. It does not compete with publication in other forms, but supplements it. I doubt that any of these eleven titles would be availa- ble now or in the foreseeable future if dependent on more costly means of publication, yet each puts into the hands of scholars material of great importance in a variety of fields. Numbers I, 2, and 8 ("A Report on a Bluff Shelter in Northeastern Oklahoma," by D. A. Baerreis and J. E. Freeman; "An Archaeological Re- port on a Cave Deposit in Northeastern Oklahoma," by J. E. Freeman; and "Site DI-29, a Rockshelter in Northeastern Oklahoma," by J. E. Freeman) are com- prehensive monographs on hitherto unreported excava- tions by the Works Progress Administration between 1937 and 1940, part of an immense program carried out in many parts of the country and still only par- tially reported. These three studies contain interesting conclusions on the changing aboriginal economic activ- ities that are revealed by a comparison of artifact inventories. Numbers 9 and i1 also report on Okla- homa ("Salvage Archaeology in Oklahoma," Volumes I and II, by J. B. Shaeffer) and comprise thirteen de- tailed reports, mostly on sites destroyed by road build- ing, and one report appraising the Archaic of the Southern Plains in the light of new data suggesting Cochise affiliations. Other numbers in the series report on widely scattered locations-a late i8th century forti- fied Indian village in Nebraska ("Nainza, the Ponca Fort," by W. R. Wood, No. 3), excavation of several sites in a hitherto neglected part of Alaska ("Archaeo- logical Investigations of . . . the Katmai National Monument, Alaska," by W. A. Davis, No. 4), the Verde Valley and surrounding parts of Arizona ("The Hohokam, Sinagua, and the Hakataya," by A. H. Schroeder, No. 5), and the California Coastal islands ("An Anthropomorphic and Morphological Analysis of a Prehistoric Skeletal Population from Santa Cruz Island, California," by T. W. McKern, No. io). Other potentialities of this (or of any similar) series are illustrated by two other titles in Archives of Archae- ology. "Documentation for some Late Mogollon Sites in... Eastern Arizona," by P. S. Martin and others (No. 6) provides nearly 200 pages of detailed tabular and descriptive material that could not, for reasons of cost, have been included in the letterpress report on these sites dug by the Chicago Natural History Mu- seum in 1959. Although relatively few specialists will need these details, in comparison to the many persons who will be interested in the general report, these spe- cialists will have at hand the necessary data for com- parative purposes or for re-analyzing and checking the conclusions reached in the main report. Microcard "supplements" to archaeological publications can pro- vide a workable and convenient solution to the problem of how fully to publish the detailed documentation that relatively few readers will need; the letterpress volume is shortened and simplified with no loss of data for the specialist. Number 7 in the series, "Japanese Source Materials on the Archaeology of the Kurile Islands," edited by C. S. Chard, consists of translations from Japanese reports (unreadable for most Americans and unavailable in most libraries) on a region which has long been looked to for possible connections with the American Arctic, connections that Chard has shown must have been slight and much too late to be involved in Eskimo origins. It can be hoped that this publication will stimulate others like it, both translations and republications of sources that have been inaccessible to interested scholars, because these can make as signifi- cant a contribution to archaeological progress as can "new" data. Archives of Archaeology is still a new venture, and both its content and its method of presentation may be modified on the basis of experience and of response from archaeologists. But there can be no doubt of its great promise. There are, of course, disadvantages in microcard publication, such as the cost of the readers now on the market (nearly $300 each). But hand readers are also available, suitable for brief or inter- mittent reference use but not for continued study, at prices as low as $15.00 (for additional details see D. A. Baerreis and J. J. Solon, American Antiquity, Vol. 25, No. 4 [1960] 623-25). And in a pinch any six- to ten-power hand lens will serve to recheck a few pages, find a reference, or scan a drawing. Many people have a deep-seated antipathy to any mechanical device that comes between them and the printed page, and there is no prospect of microcards ever superseding the shelf of constantly used volumes within reach of one's fa- vorite chair. But microcards seem to be a substantial improvement over microfilm in convenience and usa- bility; they are easily stored and retrieved; they are suitable for numerous brief publications, each on its own card; and the user can shift from preface to con- clusions, or from text to illustrations and references, as in a conventional volume--even though to the naked eye the page is unreadable it can easily be identified as a table, a photograph, a map, or a bibliographical list. The quality of photographic reproduction is of great importance in this type of publication, and it was noted in several titles in this series that some of the photographs were very dark, perhaps because the originals were dense or of poor contrast; also, over- crowded lettering on maps and charts is an even more serious fault for microcard publication than for con- ventional line cuts. These are faults of authors or editors, however, and can easily be corrected. In gen- eral the material is as readable as in the average letter- press volume.</page><page sequence="3">334 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 65 Not the least of the great advantages of microcard publication is its low cost. Editions of as few as fifteen or twenty copies can pay for themselves when sold at prices well below those of letterpress and offset publica- tions. The prices of the eleven numbers in the series under review total $15.90; there are 39 cards on which nearly 2500 pages of material are reproduced. Rapid publication is also assured, only two months being needed between acceptance of a manuscript, typed ready for publication, and the distribution of copies. One promising development, feasible but not yet on the market, is a copier with which original-size copies can be made of selected pages for individual use, thus eliminating the need for detailed notes or constant reference to pages of special interest to a user. There is no likelihood, or intention, that microcard publication will encroach on or compete with other, longer established methods. But this series shows what a valuable supplement it can be, particularly in per- mitting publication in extenso of things that editors have been forced in recent years to keep to a mini- mum-details of provenience, architectural and speci- men measurements, tables, charts, photographs and drawings. The publishers and editors of Archives of Archaeology are to be congratulated on this successful series, and it is to be hoped that it will be imitated with series for other areas of scholarship and research.
